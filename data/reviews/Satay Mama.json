{"text":"Found this new snack Asian place at the base of 3601 Hwy 7 building.   Decor: Lots of side and window seating. Very clean and refreshing look. They have free wifi available.  Food: They serve typical Asian snack foods such as fish balls, beef balls, skewers, etc. They also have combo type meals offering 2 meats or 3 meat combos with rice and 1 veg option.   Opinion: I would say this place is a hybrid of the Fish Ball Place (located on 2nd floor Pacific Mall) with Satay Sate on (Yonge Street). The sauce for me wasn't nutty and as thick as I wanted. Unfortunately, after finishing my meal, I'm still hungry.  Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5.0  Came here after seeing Gordon's post on IG. The place is small with probably enough seats for 10 people. Decor is simple and clean cut.   The skewers are grouped into three sections: meat, seafood and vegetables. You can get individual skewers or a combo which comes with 2-3 skewers, pickled radish, rice and a choice of pop or vegetable skewers. It also comes with a satay sauce.  I opted for the 3 skewer combo where I chose the beef, pork and chicken. All the skewers were tender and decently prepared. The satay sauce tasted pretty good but could have been a bit thicker. There is sufficient satay sauce to compliment the skewers and the rice. I would get an additional Thai chilli sauce next time as I felt the dish needed a kick to it.  Overall it was decent and would be good as a light meal as 3 skewers is not quite enough. They are also on the smaller side as well.   I would like to see them adding some more traditional items onto their menu such as tiger prawn skewers, sambal sauce and tempeh."}
{"text":"I went there on Friday for 4 skewers of chicken and 2 skewers of vegetables. The sauce was excellent, the chicken was a bit on a fatty and chewy side. Portion size could be bigger. Overall, it is ok experience but nothing to call home about. The owner was friendly."}
