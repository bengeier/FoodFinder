{"text":"I've ordered multiple dishes here and so far I've yet to be disappointed. Everything right down to the miso soup is good quality stuff. The sushi is always fresh and salads always crisp. These guys are always on point for delivering fresh wholesome ingredients. The only thing that falls below standards is the price. Everything is so cheap and affordable! Hard to find healthy food at their price point. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were hungry and came across this place on Yonge Street. It is run by a couple who made everything fresh. The service was outstanding. The quality of the food was incredible. I have eaten my fair share of Japanese/Korean food but I loved the Chicken Katsu they had. Their bento box was also amazing. They have recently expanded so have plenty more seating available. We will definitely be back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I had kimchee chigae (kimchee stew) and there were nice big pieces of pork inside. It was also really spicy (like we requested) and tasted really hearty and good. I really enjoyed the rice too - it had a great texture. The service was very kind and genuine. The interior had cute elements like an old radio. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches made super fresh.  I always get the club with cucumber and onions.  OMG to die for even the bread is super fresh.. Doesn't look like much from the outside but .. seriously you have to try it"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food! Definitely recommend my friends and family to check it out. I just wish they give out more side dishes.  I'll be coming again if I'm feeling for Korean"}
{"text":"Yup kumsumnida. This might be a hole in the wall but your eating the real deal here.  Kimchi is bang on as our all the k dishes here. My other half is korean I'm well trained. Want k food this is it."}
{"text":"The service was extremely good and they respond really fast too. I ordered the Korean Beef Soon Du Boo and it was amazing as they also cook everything fresh. It's a shame that I discovered this place on my last day in Richmond Hill as I would've been a regular customer here. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Decent Korean place in Richmond Hill. There's no parking so you'd have to find a plaza nearby or go to the green party. There's a small dining area and I'm sure most people just get takeout.  I got the spicy pork stir fry rice entree Mitchell was a tad bland. Someone in my group got the bulgogi and said the same thing about their dish. The other person in my group tried the kimchi fried rice and thought it was on the lower end of the spectrum of available kimchi fried rice dishes in the area.  It wasnt terrible, but it was great. The food is 2.5 stars. The service was incredibly friendly and the kimchi included was topnotch.  I may try again sometime in the future and definitely try something else."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food!  We both got the beef bulgogi bento box ($12.49) and it was a good portion for the price. Came with a lot of variety! The beef bulgogi was delicious they way they sautéed the vegetables.   It was empty when we came, the lady there definitely accommodated us very well!  There's parking at the back of the restaurant, and it's a cheaper price for lunch (until 3:30pm)"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with colleagues on a blustery wintery day, and I was very happy to see and experience this cozy little nook on Yonge.  This restaurant had probably under 20 tables but it wasn't fill anyway. It's a very long, rectangular restaurant and I hope your party is less than 4 people.  Service was impeccable. The lady was very nice to us and asked how we were, and gave us menus promptly. She also had really good posture when serving food!  Food came pretty fast and the food was hot too. Their feast combo is worth if you are famished.  I had a katsu Don rice with egg and it was delicious. Présentation was a little homemade but it matched the overall atmosphere. My colleague had pork bone soup for the first time ever, and he was very much a fan of it after his first spoonful.  I definitely recommend coming here for your core meals. I also love the little buzzer on the table to ring for service."}
{"text":"The bad: Food is acceptable. I had the Soon Du Bu (soft tofu stew) which is my go to at Korean places and it wasn't that good. Just a bit spicy and light on taste though full of seafood and soft tofu. The color also is a sign that it would light in taste. However, from our party of 8, there were positive comments on the spicy pork and bolgogi.  The Positives!: I would come back just for the service. This place is very Korean. From the elder ladies with curly hair greeting you at the door, to the pictures or old Korea around the restaurant. Our server who looked like the son was very helpful, polite and friendly. He answered all our questions and checked up on us constantly. The plentiful refills on side dishes was very nice too. If I'm in the area, I would be back, but I'm trying something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food and happy friendly service!  The new Yummy Korea sign caught my eye as I was walking down Yonge St, and as usual I was hungry. So I went in for a closer look and the Pork Bone Soup lunch special sign in the window cinched the deal, I decided to give them a try.  As it turns out, while Yummy Korea is a new name the restaurant is still owned by the same people who ran Fresh Food To Go and hence the est. 2007 on the new sign.  I ordered the Pork Bone Soup and the Chicken Katsu lunch specials to go and they were good choices. The Pork Bone soup has a nice rich and silky texture with lots of umami and a good amount of heat, and the the bones have a good amount of meat. It came with rice and kimchi. The Chicken Katsu was crispy, topped with a delicious egg mixture, and served on rice with miso soup and a tiny seaweed salad."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch as the rating on Yelp was good. Not impressed. Had the chicken katsu and found it to be dry and lacking in the amount of chicken vs batter. I wonder if it was precooked and reheated as it was not crispy but rather hard, especially the ends.The sauce over it was not very tasty either. It came with a mound of rice and some shredded cabbage (I think) that had a huge dollop of what looked like thousand island dressing. Ate around the dressing as did not like it at all. The salad and miso soup were ok. Parked across the street for free in the RH Centre for Performing Arts. Even though there were no other customers in the restaurant no one came over to see how we were doing or to ask us about our food.or to see if we needed anything. We finished eating and went to the counter to settle the bill. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Saturday! Very small restaurant with a mom and pop kind of feel. The waitress was very friendly and told us what was popular on the menu since we had never been. Unfortunately no lunch specials on weekends .. just weekdays.   My boyfriend and I ordered the Katsu don buri and the beef bulgogi and made one a \"feast #2\". Feast included 2 spring rolls, 2 kimchi pancakes and 1 shrimp tempura. This meal was definitely enough for the both of us! Salad and miso to start then the sides which included 3 side salads, cucumber, kimchi and a slaw. & the mains were an adequate size as well! The beef bulgogi and the spring rolls had a very home- cooked type of taste which wasn't a bad thing. Shrimp tempura I didn't really care for but I really enjoyed the Katsu don buri! Extra crispy with egg and a delicious sweet sauce drizzled overtop on a bed of rice!   The only downside was that my waitress forgot my order for 20 mins while my boyfriend practically finished his meal to which she was extremely apologetic. All in all a decent meal!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested this restaurant because the rating on Yelp was almost 5/5 so we decided to try it out. When we got there, the restaurant was not busy at all. If you are headed north on Yonge street it will be on your right hand side. Parking is a bit challenging but there are a couple of parking spots a little more north and also on the right hand side (gelato place)  I got the Korean fried rice with a sunny side up egg and kimchi. I also added the feast extra for $3.50 which include a choice of 1 shrimp tempera or 1 Korean spring roll and 2 kimchi pancakes. It was a little pricy for the proportion of food but it was tasty. The fried rice was tasty and the runny egg added a creamy component to the rice (like a bit of sauce). The beef was good but I wished there was more. Surprisingly the main entree also came with 3 small sides: 1) kimchi 2) pickled vegetables 3) potato salad. The meal also included miso soup which was a bit salty and a salad which could have had a bit more dressing.  Overall I was pretty satisfied with the quality of the food in comparison with the price. I might try the bento box dinners next time I come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this place when trying to find some quick food before a show at Richmond Hill Centre for the Performing Arts. To be honest, we did hesitate a moment before going in, because it doesn't look like much from outside - glad we did though.  Although I'm still not entirely sure how they do it, with such a small/limited working space, but this place offers Japanese, Korean, and Chinese food at an exceptionally quick turnaround (hence the name). We ordered \"Crispy Fried Lemon Chicken\" and a \"Dynamite Roll/Spicy Crab Roll\" combo. Both dishes came within just a FEW minutes, and each was priced under $10 a dish. Great value for sure.  Surprisingly, but consistent with much larger sit-down Japanese food restaurants, the chicken dish also came with a decent side-salad with vinaigrette, and a miso soup. The rolls were just OK, and probably not comparable to gourmet sushi joints, but it won't be easy to find something better at that price point.   Highlight of this place though is the impeccable customer service.  Aside from how quickly they served us (knowing we were in a hurry), the shop-owners of this family-run business were so friendly and polite - so refreshing when comparing with larger restaurants these days. The lady shop owner turned on some nice ambiance music just for us while we ate...little things like this are appreciated, and make this a welcoming place for anybody looking for a quick and affordable bite with excellent service!"}
