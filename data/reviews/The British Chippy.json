{"text":"If you like old fashion English style home made fish and chips then this is the best there is! I have not had fish and chips like this since living in Victoria in the 70s'. They use organic only cod and haddock and organically grown hand cut potatoes for their fries. The batter used on the fish is light and crunchy with no oil aftertaste. They carry a few British beverages, mushy peas and meat pies. Both locations are excellent for a family owned business. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First visit - a pleasant surprise! Haddock and chips with a side of slaw. All delicious! The fish was lightly battered, hot and fresh. The chips are thick cut and compliment a heavy dose of malt vinegar! Service was fast and friendly. Dining room is small, so get there early!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and I don't mind it. They have cod and haddock, which are very popular for fish and chips in the UK - but I would prefer halibut. They only have one piece options - and the price of the fish and chips is the same price as buying one piece of fish and a side order of chips. Well - you save $0.25. So I don't understand why they even have it as a menu item instead of having everything a la carte. So a two piece fish and chips of their cheaper fish (cod) will run you $24 - thats $10 for each fish and $4 for chips. At a similar shop on MacLeod trail I can get a two piece cod and chips for $15. At that same shop I will get a 2 piece halibut and chips for $21."}
{"text":"These guys have waiting for a table down to a science. We had a 30 minute wait but just after we got our table we had our drinks and food served shortly after. The gravy was delicious, and the fish and chips were the best I've had in Calgary, not to much batter, but just enough. I will be going back here to try there Beef Pie and Chips!"}
{"text":"Do you want sauce? The waitress asked.. I then asked what kind of sauce do you have?  She didn't reply so I sat there for a moment. Nothing. Like I'm supposed to know her thoughts or something?? Like tartar sauce? Does that not normally come with Fish and Chips?   She is cold and frankly not very welcoming.  I personally won't be back here again. And I haven't even tried the food yet. It's been a half hour since I ordered.. I hope it's better than the service."}
{"text":"This is a great authentic spot. It is small and usually very busy so give yourself a little bit of extra time.   The staff were helpful."}
{"text":"Having lived in the UK for 6 years and sampled some mighty fine (and some nasty) fish n'chip shops, I've had a hankering since moving back to Canada for the past 6 years. I've tried so many different places in western canada and so far only Mr. Pickwick's in Vancouver have come close.  Suffice to say I didn't have high hopes for this place in Calgary, the land of grass and more grass. I drove down south during lunch (it felt like driving to High River) to this little remote place and was pleasantly surprised that it was quite busy considering its location. Ordered the haddock and chips but they were unfortunately out of mushy peas so I had their coleslaw. Took them about 20 min to cook the order and it's good they warn you with the sign at the front about the possible wait time.  The verdict? The coleslaw was a ripoff, $1.95 for about two mouthfuls of cabbage with not enough seasoning. Fries were however quite good and tasty as it seems like they do it properly by double frying them. They say they are organic and grown by a local farmer. Haddock was ok, a little dry and chewy on the edges but the batter was quite crispy. They didn't include any condiments and for some reason didn't wrap the order in paper like I'm used to, instead it was in a Styrofoam container. They had lots of paper beside the fryer (not newspaper).  Not 5 stars but sadly they're almost the best I've had in Calgary so far, maybe next time I'll try the cod to see if it's any better than the haddock. The Cat'n Fiddle pub on 16th Ave has fish n'chip halibut specials on Fridays and I enjoy their battered fish a bit better but the chips are better at the Britishchippy."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait. And wait. And wait some more.  I first came around 6 p.m. on a weekday night soon after their opening and it was absolute mayhem. No one had any clue what was going on, hostess/servers included. We waited in the back by the till for an hour then left, without being close to being seated. And still craving fish and chips.  We returned on a weekday for lunch and sat down immediately, which was nice.  But still, be prepared to wait: The food takes forever. To the tune of about 45 minutes even with only two other tables occupied.  It's good (I particularly enjoyed the haddock and an extra side of curry sauce for our chips) but the waiting time really kills the deal. Even the DVD of Fawlty Towers couldn't hold my attention for that long.  I suspect they're still getting organized. But even the service is still a bit abrupt/spotty.  I can only hope that The British Chippy improves with time - I won't be back before then."}
{"text":"My Wife and I along with another couple decided to try The British Chippy for dinner recently.  We arrived a little after 6pm on a Saturday and had to wait just under 30 minutes for a table.  Each of us ordered the cod & chips, which was $12.50 each. When the food arrived, we were all rather astonished at how small the portions were.  The fish was a single piece of fish, which the women were satisfied with, but the men felt was too small for the price they were charging.   The amount of fries you get with your order was laughable.  I counted 16 fries on my plate.  Yes, 16 fries.  Do to the small portion sizes, it didn't take long for us to finish the meal. The men at the table all felt like they easily could of ate at least another piece of fish.  We looked at the menu to see how much another piece of fish was, and it was $8.75 for an additional piece of cod.  Heck no we said.   While we had been eating we couldn't help but overhear another couple who were seated across from us, who were also rather discouraged by the portion sizes.  Perhaps if The British Chippy had a lunch special, the lower price might make it worth the trip, but sadly, they don't even have lunch specials.  If they introduced lunch specials, they actually might have increased business during the lunch hour and wouldn't have to close down Mondays and Tuesdays like they do.  Regardless, none of us will eat there again.  We just don't feel like we are getting value for our money with the prices they are charging and the portion sizes offered."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. I have been wanting to try The British Chippy for ages. It's a 5 minute drive from my place, and I love me some good fish and chips. I decided on takeout as the restaurant is quite tiny and fills up quickly I imagine. It took 40 minutes for the order to be ready, but it was packed when I arrived so I understand the wait.   I ordered the haddock and chips. The haddock was well done, nice and crispy. But the chips were not great. They were quite soggy, like they had been sitting out for a long time. That was disappointing. I feel conflicted because the fish was yummy, but the chips fell flat.   I am willing to try it again, as maybe I caught them in the midst of their rush. Not ruling it out just yet!"}
{"text":"Every single time I visit this place, the service is impeccable, friendly and professional!  The food - to die for. Definitely worth trying the fish & chips & the chicken pot pie!  A+ in my books!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is really tiny but, food is amazing.  price is a bit too expansive  and their tartar sauce , I must say best I've ever tried."}
{"text":"Finally I found delicious fish and chips in Calgary!  Small restaurant so go early if you want to eat in.   Steady stream of take out orders.   The family all tried the British sodas. Hubby had a Vimto (or something) black current flavour. He loved it! Children had Irn Bru a orange cream soda flavour. They all thought it was one of the best pops they had had.   The cod and halibut are both offered for the same price. We all had cod and it was perfect. Battered just right. The fries were fresh cut and crispy. I needed to add salt to everything but no big deal.   We had a great meal and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Genuine fish & chips done properly with quality fish selection.  Be prepared to wait a long time, however.  Definitely call ahead and order your take-out about 30 minuts prior to picking it up."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I like about going to a place for a quick bite, it's a simple menu. The fact that I can go to place and not be inundated with something that resembles a culinary tome as opposed to a menu means a lot to me. I mean, look at the name - The British Chippy. I think I have an idea of what I want to eat when I come here.  This little eatery, tucked in the middle of a strip mall in Bridlewood features a small and humble menu featuring some popular British favourites aside from the items of its namesake. In addition to the handcut cod and haddock and organic potatoes, you can also get traditional meat pies, real mushy peas, fishcakes and that delectable curry sauce for dipping your chips. Delicious.  To wash it down there's also a selection of drinks including domestic and imported soda (Lilt, Vimto, Dandelion Burdock, Irn Bru), beer (Guinness and Boddington's) or a nice tea.  The fish is cooked to perfection. They are cooked to order and brought to your table piping hot. The crispy batter is wonderful and delightfully light followed by the juicy, flaky meat of the fish. The chips are also well done and serve as the perfect companion to match the 6 oz of bliss.  Meat pies are also good and do not take a backseat to the fish and chips. The pastry is flaky and the fillings are hearty, savoury with the proper meat to gravy ratio.   If you have not done so already, try the curry sauce...please. This unassuming side was an unexpected surprise and is now my current go-to dip for chips or fishcakes.   All in all, I like the British Chippy. The food is tasty, the menu is solid and its close to home. My only complaint is the strange hours as it's closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. In addition, they are closed between the lunch and dinner service so be sure to check the hours before you visit."}
{"text":"this place is ok but not my absolute fav. love their chips, definately the best in yyc. i wanted to love their fish as well, but maybe it was just an off day because ive heard ppl swear by this place! will cone back again after my trip to yyz next week"}
{"text":"The cod was delish but expected it to be bigger! :)the chips tasted homemade which was good!"}
{"text":"British Chippy serves obviously fresh fish that is lightly battered and nice big British style chips.  Everything was very good and clearly fresh.  I recommend getting curry to dip your chips in. Yum.  Twas a long trek, but British Chippy was well recommended by those polled on twitter, so off we went. British Chippy is in a strip mall in the far south community of Bridlewood.  It's not a large place, around 15 tables and pretty basic decor.  There is a waiting space and counter by the kitchen to serve those that come in for take-away.  When we arrived all the tables were full and there were a few others waiting for a table.  I had expected that as I had been fore-warned that it could be busy and that is also well-covered in the previous reviews.  Our wait turned out to be around 25 minutes, but half-way through the wait, the owner took our order \"so you don't have to wait twice\" and brought us the Guinness that we ordered.  I thought that that was a pretty civilized way to handle those that wait.  As we stood in the foyer, lovingly craddling our Guinness, we couldn't help but notice that this little fish & chip joint was full of British accents.  That bodes well, we thought.  The menu is short and sweet, you can have Cod or Haddock with chips or one of their meat pies.  There are a number of sides that you can add, like curry for the chips, coleslaw and mushy peas. They have Guinness and Boddingtons and some UK pop (like Irn Bru), house wine, etc.  I had the Haddock and chips with curry and coleslaw.  The piece of Haddock was huge and perfectly done, the batter is just thick enough while allowing the fish to be the superstar.  The chips are british style, a little thicker and are great dipped in the curry.  The coleslaw was fresh and crisp and nicely sauced."}
{"text":"Ive heard this place was great . But my husband and I weren't that impressed. We got fish and chips my daughter got sausage and chips. Sausage and chips were fanatasic. Fish was dry. Would not got back for fish and chips. Coleslaw was extra costs. Prices were around 15 for 1 piece of fish. I would recommend Sea restaurant in McKenzie Towne for fish and chips. Better atmosphere prices are better food is also better ."}
{"text":"Bad Service, went in for an eat in meal. Sign said \"take a seat\" \"take out at the back\" so a table came available after just a couple of minutes so we sat down even though the sever had neglected to clean it we thought its busy so we would get out of the way of new customers. After being sat for a few minutes the server came over and said we would have to move as other people were waiting for this table. This happens and i understand that but she was very rude about it so we decided to leave. I thought i would follow this experience up with a phone call to inform the owner. The canadian I spoke with did not seem at all interested in what I had to say so needless to say not impressed. I have had take out here before though. So food wise its not bad, the fish was a little over cooked and the chips were definitely over cooked. Not 100% authentic and coming from a British Chippy background (3rd generation fish fryer and chippy owner) I do know what I am talking about. All in all the food is Ok at best and service appalling. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the British Chippy. It is a casual dining at its best. The fish is high quality, crispy, and downright delicious. I enjoy the chips, which are more like hashbrowns than french fries. I also really love ordering a pot of tea to enjoy while episodes of Black Adder air on the television in the background.  If you go, make sure you save room for essert. The banana fritters with ice cream are AWESOME. They're drizzled with chocolate and with four on a plate, perfect for sharing with a friend."}
{"text":"The old adage of  \"good things come to those who wait\" certainly applies here. You are going to wait for your food (or a table if you go right at supper time) - but it's going to be worth it.  The size of the fish is huge. The fries are delicious."}
{"text":"I was rather sad when our neighbourhood Decker's Fish & Chips closed down. That's why I was delighted to see that The British Chippy rose from its ashes, so to speak.  They have done wonders with the interior. As Decker's, it was relaxing, nautical, simple. As Chippy's, it's warm brown and sleeker. The large screen TV showing British shows is a nice touch, although I miss the daily newspapers that its predecessor had for those waiting for their takeout orders. That would have made my 10 minute wait go faster, although today, I was just as happy to sit and close my eyes for a few minutes.  The chips are huge. Well done. As Willman says, they're tasty. My haddock was huge. It hung off of my plate by a good couple of inches. Not too much batter and not too greasy. Very smooth on the palette. Done up fresh.  Piecewise? Not bad. I used to get two pieces of haddock when it was Decker's (sorry, I can't help but compare Chippy to its predecessor). I just got one piece with my lunch. Mind you, it was big.  They put three packs of tartar in my bag. Nice. I miss the paper product container and newspaper wrap that Decker's used. It seemed more \"British\" that way. The British Chippy does have plain paper wrap that they put over the Styrofoam container.  Their menu isn't as extensive as Decker's, but I imagine it will grow in time. I'd like to try some of the meat pies next time."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and a bit pricey for  lunch.  Two orders of halibut (1 piece of fish per order) $14.50 each.  Coleslaw extra $2.75, gravy $2.75, Pop $2.35.  All in $40."}
{"text":"If you want authentic, fresh delicious British fish and chips this is the place to go to in Calgary. There is another location in Okotoks, I haven't been yet, but I will definitely go after experiencing what they do. The fries, or chips, are so delicious. I never leave any on my plate. I love that they have malt vinegar on the table, a necessity for chips! Also ketchup of course. You can choose between Haddock and cod. I've tried both. I really liked the cod I think. The Haddock was great as well though.   The mushy peas are delicious because they are exactly that! Mushy peas :-) I like British food and I have eaten fish and chips in England quite a few times because I have family there. This place was really good. And every time I've gone in the place has been packed with what feels like happy customers.  The fish was delicate and I could taste the flavor inside of the light crispy batter. They serve their fish with some tartar sauce on the side and a fresh piece of lemon. I ordered a cold can of ginger beer and it tasted just perfect. Good brand directly from England. I liked my fish and chips and all the trimmings. A lot."}
{"text":"I'd been craving fish and chips for a couple days, and The British Chippy is about a 10 minute walk from my house.   I called on a Sunday at about 6:25p 35 minutes before they were to close and was told my order would be ready at 6:45p. When I arrived I paid and was handed my food about 4 minutes later. The food came wrapped in paper and in a plastic bag (They seem to have ditched the Styrofoam containers that past reviewers mentioned).  The food was still hot when I got it home and the fish was absolutely wonderful, I had cod and it was about 2.5 pieces of the store bought , English style stuff and was nice and thick. and the chips were pretty good too. I will have to try their meat pies and banana fritters next time I ordered as they sound interesting.  My only nit pick is that I wish they had a two piece combo price and I would have like some more fish.  Defiantly worth the walk over, and I'll be back next time I have that craving!"}
{"text":"Don't get me started on this piece of my old hometown...  Being from \"The Rock\" (Newfoundland, Canada) and having fish and chips as a first (and foremost) food group..any islander would agree - NO ONE DOES IT LIKE HOME!!!  ...that said, having discovered the British Chippy was a moment saved in time forever...I had arrived. This small little restaurant is buried somewhere in the deep south that I am completely unable to find without severe GPS help and has vey limited hours so check before you go.  The menu is simple. DEEP.FRIED.FISH (and chips)!  They use both Haddock and Cod (NFLD style), covered in a thin and crispy batter - made to order and so fresh each time that you would hardly find anything close elsewhere in this Prairie city. The fish is white, flaky, hot and overall perfect (a hard shoe to fill when judged by a Nflder raised on this stuff) - but they do it! The fish is accompanied by thick cut, organics fries that are amazing. I don't know why - but amazing. Again, fresh and hot and amazing - order their gravy to go with it, do it.  ....while at it, order a Boddingtons to wash it down - England here we are!  There are other items on the menu from the authentic UK owners such as mushy peas, meat pies and British pop. I have to confess - I have only ever had the cod and fries and it makes me uber happy each and every time.  I highly recommend any F&C lover attend this fantastic locale for a feed, and if you don't love F&C - GO ANYWAYS, you might be a changed person after!"}
