{"text":"Had great quality when it opened but since the renovations a year or two ago the quality is below average. The selection is limited and most rolls taste identical. You can also expect to be yelling to be heard at your table due to the open layout and popularity with large groups.

The review would be one star but I need to give credit for the service I received."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice. Always gotta give a place a second chance. Both times I have been underwhelmed, especially after receiving such favourable reviews both on yelp and by friends. 

The meals are average quality with somewhat stale ingredients. The biggest kicker for me is it is relatively expensive for the underwhelming food. Don't get me wrong nothing wrong with value and I can appreciate a place that charges according to what they serve. This place needs to re-evaluate somewhat."}
{"text":"Plutôt 3 étoiles et demi, je n'ai pas allumé sur le restau, mais j'ai tout de même eu une agréable soirée!

Les plats sont beaux, bien présentés. Comme je l'ai mentionné, je n'ai pas été impressionné par le goût du repas, mais jy retournerai pour faire changement à la routine.

Ma copine et moi avons pris le sashimi de boeuf et les calmars frits. Le plat de résistance : assiette de sushi ( ceux aux patates douces, d'autres aux avocados, et aussi, au saumon épicé) et une pizza sushi. L'essemble était bien!

Le service est excellent, nous n'avons pas attendu longtemps malgré qu'il y avait du monde. Le personnel est sourriant et acceuillant. 

Soirée agréable sans plus, pour une soirée calme mais qui fait changement de la routine. N'oubliez pas votre vin!"}
{"text":"Great, crispy tempura. Amazing avocado rolls (we can't figure out what makes them so great, but they're unusually good!). Very inventive rolls (my favorite is the \"Tropical\" which has eel, tempura, mango and cream cheese...you wouldn't think the flavors meld but it's wonderful!). Highly recommended and very reasonably priced (as long as you stick to the basic maki rolls; I haven't yet tried the speciality rolls so can't comment on them)."}
{"text":"This is a great BYOW sushi restaurant ! Yesterday was the 4th time I went and I always have a lovely experience. The sushi is fresh and delicious and the rolls are copious.I decided to finally write a review because I especially appreciated my dining experience last night. We were a table of 8 people and we had come to celebrate my birthday. I chose 5 Saisons because I had noticed that they were good at accommodating large groups and boy was I right! The servers and owner are very nice - they made us feel welcome and were attentive. We got served quickly and they also let us take our time ordering. We were allowed to bring our own cake and they prepared it for us on a platter with cut fruit and a candle! So sweet! I DEF recommend going to 5 Saisons !"}
{"text":"Expensive but oh so delicious sushi! Have been multiple times and well worth the price."}
{"text":"We went there as a couple on a Saturday night.  The place is always busy.  Service is courteous and prompt. 
We had the sashimi plate at 29.50$ and 2 maki rolls: the Rainbow and the Kamikasé. Everything was excellent.  The fish was super fresh, the rolls are tasty and the presentation is refined without overdoing it. It is our 3rd time here and certainly not the last. 
The restaurant is BYOB so that's a plus.  Prices are fair for the quality."}
{"text":"5 Saisons was one of the best sushi experiences that I ever had.  I live in New York and actually spent two weeks in Tokyo earlier this year, so I have \"high standards.\"  My girlfriend who is Korean was feeling homesick and so we went looking for Korean food one night while in Montreal.  We couldn't find any place that was open but saw 5 Saisons, which has a  somewhat striking exterior - like a house set back from the street.

First, the rolls with soy paper wrap (or something like that) and the chef's special sauce - were amazing.

Then, the shrimp and vegetable tempura was delicious and more than plentiful.  

We are back in New York, and still talking about this place.  I actually want to return to Montreal just to eat here, at least every other day.

One plus is also that it's BYO."}
{"text":"What ever happened to the customer is always right?

I have several life-threatening allergies that make dining out a challenge at times.  I travel with a detailed (bilingual) card outlining all my allergies and always present it to the server before ordering my meal. More often than not, the server will check with the chef before I order and I am presented with options. 

5 Saisons WAS one of my favourite local restaurants and I have eaten there many many times.  Up till now.  Last night, we ordered the same dishes we always do - and were shocked!

My meal came visibly swimming in allergens.  Thankfully, I noticed and the plate was returned to the kitchen.  The next attempt was equally poisonous.  The waiter acted put out and aggravated and even asked if it was a bad allergy!  (We told him I stop breathing within minutes!)

When we complained about the issue - one of food safety - it was very rudely pointed out to us that we got our food, so the problem was solved. I spoke to the manager who told me to do whatever I want.  So I am!

Food allergies are serious.  THey are not food preferences.  Those of us who live with the risk of anaphylaxis understand it is a risk and inconvenient and make our choices carefully.  We inspect our food before ingesting.  We understand that mistakes happen.  But we should not be forced to accept rude, poor and dangerous service.

I understand the restaurant business is difficult and that picky eaters are unpleasant to deal with but I still do remember a day when the customer was right."}
{"text":"Amazing. the experience as well as the food was great. This place burned down and just reopened so we went in for a try. 
the salmon and tuna sashimi was very good. it had just the right amount of fat on it. 
they have a lot of unconventional types of sushi we tried the sushi pizza it was little bits a sashimi over a tempura rice. very good."}
{"text":"Exceptional. Fish was extremely fresh and chefs specials were very impressive. Excellent meal. 
Least enjoyed: diamond
Rocky, orchid and poker face were fantastic. The flavors all worked so well together.
Hotate as sweet as in Japan."}
{"text":"Amazing food!

This is by far my favorite sushi joint in MTL. Food is creative and always very very fresh.
Giving it a 5star because I have yet to find a sushi spot in MTL that is Better. 
It is however VERY pricey. But for sushi I find spending a little more is worth it the freshness. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant is nice, however the lighting is very bright.. i find this to be a similar trend to a lot of asian themed restaurants in MTL. They should dim the lights for better vibe.

Bonuses from this spot: they deliver locally!! And the japonese dunplings are absolutely amazing.. oh.. and its Bring your own wine to boot!"}
{"text":"Ordered the special for 2, this had to be the poorest quality sushi I have had in a while. The rolls were 90% rice and and beyond bland. They were rolled so loose that they would fall apart when you tried to pick them up. The sashimi looked like it was cut a butter knife and the quality of the fish however fresh was poor.

This had been a go to sushi take out spot for us for years. We were disappointed the last time but figured it could have been an off night. Low and behold this was worse. The price of the special for 2 is also $10 more then it used to be.

I cannot comment on the restaurant and service but if you are looking for some quality sushi, I would move on."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch since I was in the area and was not disappointed. Very good service and great food with generous portions. I also like the music ( instrumental piano of classics and greatest hits).I ordered the una-kuy and the shrimps tempura lunch special. I can't wait to come back and try something else with friends."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant, right on the corner of Sherbrooke and Marcil, directly across the street from Cote des Neiges park. Coming from Seattle, I am used to super fresh sushi and I was somewhat skeptical, coming here, how Montreal sushi would fare in comparison (yes, I guess I AM a bit of a snob...!). I am happy to report that the sushi here was wonderfully fresh and delicious, with a large offering of choices to boot. And I thought the prices were quite reasonable!

In fact, I encountered many happy surprises the night my friend and I dined here. It was a recent Monday evening and I gave myself ample time to find a parking spot. Lo and behold, there was ample street parking all along Sherbrooke! (That NEVER happens!). Next, I was surprised - in a good way - to see how nice and roomy the restaurant interior was: white linens on the tables, lots of light from all the windows facing Sherbrooke, very airy and quasi-formal aesthetic. Lovely. Next, surprisingly, the restaurant was empty save for my friend and me and one other couple on the other side of the room. My friend said this place was packed later on in the week, but even she was surprised how vacant it was at 7pm on the night we were there. It was if we had a private restaurant to ourselves. 

The service was impeccable (perhaps because the restaurant was so empty? I don't know). Our server could not have been nicer or more attentive, our water glasses were refilled regularly, our food came out promptly. 

And, again, the food. It was so good. We opted for 5 different types of sushi and we ate about half of it, having to take the remaining half home. The waiter happily obliged us by halving up the left-overs and boxing it in two separate boxes for us. I should note that the presentation of the sushi was really lovely, with a flower garnish artfully placed on the contemporary platter. 

This is a BYOB (bottle of wine) place, FYI. 

Despite us ordering so much food, the total bill came to $37. I thought that was super reasonable.

Lastly, I must add a side note: my friend and I hadn't seen each other since high school, nearly 35 years earlier (crazy, I know!). So we spent a lot of time catching up with each other. Never did we feel rushed to order, eat and/or leave by the waiter or the owner. We sat there for hours, reminiscing and talking about what we've been up to over the past three plus decades. The owner and waiter couldn't have been more obliging or nicer. In fact, they even took photos of us!

I visit Montreal every summer and already I'm looking forward to returning here!"}
{"text":"First experienced at this restaurant and I thought it was really nice,  well presented,  great taste. Prices are comparable to other fine sushi restaurant and I think it is appropriate for what I had. recommended from my experience."}
{"text":"If you love sushi and sashimi, this place will knock your socks off. But, while that is all superbly fresh and beautifully served, don't skip the endless offering of specialty sushi, Sashimi, Maki....the specialty items is what will rock your boat even more. 
One very amazing and awesome place. I'll be coming back here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi place! Try the white tuna you will be surprised.  The sashimi plate was amazing really fresh!"}
{"text":"One of the best Sushi in town. The staff is very nice & the owner is very present."}
{"text":"Nice interior. Restaurant was slammed so it was a while before we saw our waiter, but we ordered the tempura appetizer and the chef's choice for 2 and things came out pretty quickly. We were very satisfied."}
{"text":"This BYOW sushi spot is one of my favourites , fresh sushi and great selection. I've been multiple times and have never been disappointed in the food or the service ! I highly recommend the lover and the grilled scallop sushi roll. Nice atmosphere inside for a date or a dinner with friends/family"}
{"text":"I didn't believe my friends when they said this was a major Jew hangout. Sure enough, walking in there, I immediately recognized (not exaggerating) 8-10 friends from the Jewish community. Unfortunately, there wasn't a single on who I actually wanted to see

I worked up quite the bill trying soup, appetizer and main course. The food was good, not great. My sushi, though trendy in appearance, was about the quality you could expect from sushi shop. Even the specialty rolls that cost twice as much didn't well represent the art form of sushi.

Nice night out, but food itself (all I care about) isn't worth the money."}
{"text":"Chic place , many tables, spacious, good service, sushis good enough, nothing remarquable but if you have the westmont budget for one night its up to you. They put off the air conditioner just for us .. this is a chic service for me."}
{"text":"They bring you water right away. 
It's a middle class restaurant. 
It's a bring your own wine. 
The sushi was really good!
You tick off your choices on a list. But you can also order off a menu. 
Very reasonably priced."}
