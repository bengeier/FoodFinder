{"text":"Good poutine when you've got a poutine craving. Service here is fast and friendly. I prefer the traditional poutine, while my other half likes the bacon poutine, they put a lot of bacon on it which is good for the bacon lovers out there! They have a lot of different kinds of poutine for those adventurous ones."}
{"text":"Holy Poutine Batman, this place is great. Just had the original as I am a fine of classic flavors, the fries were nice and crispy in a bath of gravy with huge chunks of curds. Did a great job satisfying my craving for comfort food. Def recommend if you have a hunkerin for fries with gravy."}
{"text":"How do you manage to make french fries taste bad? Ask the good folks at Smoke's. Then add bland toppings, flavourless gravy, cram it in a one-size-only box, and charge too much.   Like so many other decisions made while drunk, you'll regret it in the morning. And if you eat here sober, you probably think the Keg is a good place to get a steak."}
{"text":"Overlooked fries, salty gravy,... And curds only on top.  Not  the best poutine around.  Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"We've had a couple of the variations here (montreal, smoked meat, steak peppercorn) and generally the food has been good. Each poutine is definitely a meal for two. The fries are appropriately crispy, though the 'extra' toppings in addition to the gravy and cheese tend to be unceremoniously just dumped out of the packs they are stored in. As a result there's work to be done in eating the poutine so as to not eat all the toppings at the beginning and be left with just gravy towards the middle-end of the poutine. Meats and such are all bunched up, so you'll be spending time separating out the various slices of meat from one another.   To be clear: this isn't a bad place to get poutine. But it's also isn't exceptional, especially for the price. If I want a poutine that is nice, but convenience to get to, I'll come to Smoke's. But if I want a really exciting poutine I'm definitely going further abroad.   Oh! And they only take cash and debit. So be forewarned that no credit cards are accepted!"}
{"text":"Mouth wateringly delishious, gotta try the nacho grand, or montreal, both excellent picks. Be sure to eat it fresh to taste it at its best. Definitely my fav lunch time stop when in the area, if only it were good for my diet.  Be sure to check it out you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The reputation is deserved. The staff were super friendly and helpful and even though there was a lot of food, the ingredients tasted very good and you hardly notice you are eating a heart attack in a box. I would come back to try more flavours!"}
{"text":"Mountain of fries, squeaky curds, ok amount of meat, your classic Smoke's Poutinerie. Staff is really friendly. Similar to other Smoke's chain, the food is there to only satisfy your cravings.  On Ritual."}
{"text":"I was hungover so I figured some greasy, heavy food would help. I walked in and was quickly greeted with a friendly smile. I ordered the pulled pork poutine and made the mistake of ordering a large. It was made fresh to order which I was pleased with. I asked for extra gravy and was surprised that they charge for it. Really what does gravy cost? The food was good but it cost me almost $20 with a can of pop. That's way too pricey for some fries and a little pork.  This is why I gave it 3 stars and not 4."}
{"text":"Oh so so good especially late on a Friday or Saturday night!  There is usually always a line up but it is worth every second of the wait.  They have tons of various gourmet poutines to choose from such as the cheeseburger, pulled pork, chicken chilli, and many many more.  I recommend you try every single one of them.  This place never disappoints and a great addition to Liberty Village!"}
{"text":"It's poutine. No, really. The curds sometimes squeak and they don't melt right away. The gravy is plentiful and rich. The fries are the standard overdone potatoey consistency that they are in Quebec. Smokes does it right. This would be one of my shortest reviews, except I do feel compelled to explain the missing star. I ordered the bacon mac poutine (\"Oh! Canada\" I think). It was pictured with creamy homemade mac and Canadian bacon. It turned out to be made with Kraft dinner and regular bacon. I didn't think of having them make me a new order, but deceptive advertising is bad. I get the impression from reading the various articles on the wall that each franchise has to figure out how to deliver Smokes on their own, so maybe this franchisee just got it wrong. But I sure hope someone reads this and makes sure the product is consistent before it comes to the States, because people here will not be nearly as polite and forgiving."}
{"text":"My wife and I split a large pulled pork. I could feel how heavy it was when they handed me my poutine. Really filling. Also tons of different choices. Smoke' isn't my favorite poutine place but worth your money."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Ordered a meal size and there was barely any cheese curds. Only 3-4 pieces. I was searching for it, couldn't see anything. Honestly for $10 it's not worth it. You can get better meals for that price. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Four stars but not because I think their poutine is amazing. If anything, it's kinda average. If you have never had poutine and/or are just looking for the best poutine in Toronto, or if you're from Quebec or have traveled there, eaten poutine there, and want to find poutine places in Toronto to take out your anger or snobbery on, pass on this place. I'm giving this place 4 stars just because I'm using other Smoke's locations as a standard/benchmark, and this might just be the best Smoke's I've been to. Fries were made decently, serving size was plenty generous, staff were friendly - great place to satisfy a craving."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... but I will bump it to 4 stars.  Was in the neighbourhood and was hungry so we stopped by to get a snack to share.   We decided on the korean poutine... which was ok for me but hubby enjoyed it! It was a bit too spicy for me, I guess I had expected more of a bulgogi taste to it rather than a spicy chili taste.  Overall the fries and cheese curds were great! I will probably go more for more of the traditional one next time!"}
{"text":"Long line ups during the weekend but of course it's expected. This place is a 2 minutes walk and is always worth the wait, if you're in a rush you can call ahead for pick up. Always hot and always getting your order correct!!  One of the better locations in Toronto give it a try."}
{"text":"Did I hear that this company is going to be publicly traded on the stock market!  Way to go Smoke's.  You've made Canada proud with your amazingly concocted poutines.  I traditionally go for the triple pork and have tried quite a few different poutines here but I think right now my favorite is the nacho poutine.  Something about guacamole, sour cream and salsa on fries just makes my mouth water."}
{"text":"HUGE portions and a but too greasy for my liking, but it does the trick. Had the triple pork and was not dissapointed."}
{"text":"I've tried the cheese burger poutine and It didn't have much flavour to me. I've also tried the chicken ranch poutine and it tasted ok. But the third time going back they were advertising jerk chicken poutine and of course me being Jamaican I had to try it and its by far the best poutine i've had. I honestly thought the chicken would have lack some flavour to it but it had just the right amount of pepper, spice and heat to it, so if you generally like spicy food, I would recommend it. I would for sure get the jerk chicken poutine again. It was too good to be true."}
{"text":"Gross. Whatever you do don't order the chicken topping. It's been a long time since I've eaten poutine and I will never eat it at Smokes again. My advice, pass."}
{"text":"On this rare occasion, I ate Smoke's sober (what!), and it was actually really good.   I was doing some furniture shopping in Liberty Village, and I was cranky. I'm an excellent Canadian, so I knew what I needed: gravy! Stat! I went for an old favourite, the Vegetarian Deluxe, extra cheese. Fries, gravy, (extra) curds, mushrooms, fried onions, and green peas. The peas really make it pop! Add some pepper and sriracha, and bam! Even, though this is a big chain now, this specific poutine is worth four fabulous stars."}
