{"text":"So amazing. The bacon was perfectly crisp. The potatoes were seasoned just right. The pancakes and french toast were so yummy. Cannot wait to go back and try everything they have to offer."}
{"text":"It's Monday, my daughter, granddaughter & I went by for lunch and they're closed! We were very hungry & I was really looking forward to it. We took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Brand new bakery and café, open less than a week! Despite the name, grab and go bakery selection is currently a bit limited (mostly cupcakes, with whole cakes available for special order) and menu is a it more expansive than the name implies: they have great sandwiches (the killer club was fantastic!), along with wings and barbecue coming soon.

I suspect what they'll really be known for is their Sunday dinners- check their website to know what will be featured each week, but they're aiming to be a spot to grab a home-cooked meal after church. Definitely a great spot for this neighborhood, and one that sounds like it'll be pretty successful.

Service is on point, friendly and informative. Interior is clean and nicely decorated with a modern theme and lots of fresh flowers. Note that they are closed on Mondays!"}
{"text":"I went in at 4:30 on a Friday. The menu has burgers and sandwiches and the like. I ordered the catfish dinner which was two pieces of well fried catfish with fries and a drink. The catfish was seasoned and breaded really well, fried perfectly. Fries were pretty standard, but good. All of it came in a basket on top of bread to soak the grease, which is smart and seldom seen. The sign said fresh squeezed lemonade, but what I got was a bold neon pink, so I'm not sure how that works....  Area was cute, ample table space. There were no bakery goods available except some snickerdoodle cookies on the counter. It absolutely did not feel like a bakery at all, and not really a café either. Just kind of your run of the mill greasy spoon. Not necessarily bad. Just not what I'm looking for."}
{"text":"So far the best place ive had catfish from. I always order via uber eats. They always quickly fix any mistakes and are very friendly. All the food is delicious and affordable.  They got kool-aid and sweet potatoe pie to die for.. cant wait to actually visit the establishment.."}
{"text":"Great food. Warm family atmosphere. Tried the Angus cheeseburger and Hawk's Killer Club Sandwich. ...soooo delicious!!!! Can't wait to try more on the menu"}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple of times! I LOVE IT, the turkey tips are AMAZING, and so are the pizza puffs! My husband is a Chicagoan.... he raves about the puff and the Italian beef. The customer service is friendly, they treat you like family....! Definitely try this place out, yiu wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the closes thing to Chicago I can get. I been in Vegas for almost 9yrs from Chicago and have always tried to find something to eat that was almost Chicago style. So on Fridays and Saturdays they barbecue. And man if them ribs was not tendeeeeerrrrrrr I don't knw what they was. And to top it off that BBQ sauce hit it on the head. The closes thing to some Chicago mild sauce. I was so happy lol. She also a bakery as well by the way. I didn't get anything cause them ribs really did enough for me. Go check her out ya'll I want be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered here from UberEats or Postmates can't remember. My mom had the catfish dinner, which she loved it! And my mom is very picky when it comes to her food. I noticed they have desserts too, I wish that was an option when I ordered it. Whenever I'm on that side of town I'll definitely be trying other things especially their desserts!"}
{"text":"Simple fresh and home cooking done right! Ms Sandra will make you feel like family. Originally from Chicago and cooking here in LV. Food is nothing short than perfection and portions are good for lunch the next day. When here stop in and get a slice of sweet potato pie!"}
