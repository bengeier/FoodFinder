{"text":"Conveniently located, I have recently had lunch and dinner here. For lunch we had only 30 mins. And they worked really hard to satisfy our time concern. I had sushi and my friends had all different lunch options. We were all satisfied with quality of food and the service. I also had AYCE dinner here two days ago. My orders came very quick and correct, very good quaility for the price. There were enough servers to constantly check for empty plates and refill the tea. I will definitely be frequent customer."}
{"text":"Love this place!! It is always hard to find a good local sushi place. Kiku was recommended to me quite a few years ago and it has been my go to place ever since. Only time I was disappointed was when I went and it was closed for renovations a few years ago. Other that, great food, great staff and I love the use of the new tablet ordering system."}
{"text":"DO NOT at all use their delivery service, even though their food is ok but considering always having to wait at least 1.5 hrs for their food and having them telling us the wrong time every single time we ordered delivery service it is just so very frustrating. I believe a good restaurant comes with both good food and good services, cannot be good without one or the other."}
{"text":"Food quality is mediocre. Serving is mediocre. Ordering using the iPad is nice, since you can see what was ordered and they are less likely to miss your order.  There are other better AYCE sushi places around the area."}
{"text":"Sushi Kiku, you guys brought me out of hibernation.    I am truly disappointed, where did it all go wrong?!  I am a regular take-out patron of yours and what I brought home today was abysmal.  It really hurts me to write this, but management needs to get their hands out of their pockets.  What I found suspect was that SushiKiku.com has omitted the North York location from the website.  Intentional? or technical error?  Is every restaurant individually owned?  My gut feel is that this restaurant either changed ownership or changed the cook staff in the past few weeks and the quality of the food reflects the change.  Here's my review on the food.  The miso soup was like drinking warm water with seaweed floating around, flavorless.  The salad dressing is regular French dressing, I believe the grated ginger with French is no more.  The sushi rice recipe must have been altered, as the rice was crumbling into my soy sauce and had a dull taste, like it was missing sweet Mirin.  The sushi was packed and presented nicely, so it wasn't loosely packed rice.  Lastly, I always look forward to this dish for every take out, the tempura box.  The box just closes with two long pieces of hot golden crispy shrimp, on a bed of coaster sized yams, zucchini, eggplant, with a large floret of broccoli.  The absolute perfect pairing to the meal (see the pictures by others and you will know what I mean!).  But what I got was literally half the size.  Each and every item was one bite size, not the normal three bite size and it wasn't even the typical crunchy tempura I've always ate.   Please new owners and new cooks, go back to the way it used to be!  You guys had the best and biggest bento boxes...now you're just comparable.  Why should I drive all the way to you for comparable sushi?  I will come back in a few weeks to order the same items and follow up with another review."}
{"text":"Before even entering the restaurant, the decal on the exterior covered all their windows and you could barely tell where the front door was unless someone was exiting the restaurant. It looks closed on the outside basically. Pretty unwelcoming in my opinion.   Came here for a birthday dinner. Food was alright - sashimi was a-ok. Glad they got the number of pieces right when we ordered salmon sashimi. Most places don't serve the right number of pieces - just so they could pace us.. Although we had a group of 20 people.  Reason why I am giving only 2 stars is because the service. The service here is SLOW. We ordered about 15 dishes the first time. About half of them showed up within 40 minutes. At one point, we had finished all those dishes and waited for another 20 minutes for another dish to arrive. Not sure if we were really that hungry or they couldn't keep up with us. We submitted another order (2nd order) and we got some items on the 2nd order 15 minutes later. Mind you, there were still some dishes missing from the first order. After finishing our 2nd order of food, our remaining items from the 1st order FINALLY came. About time!! We ordered our dessert and we still had more food arrive from our first order! Talk about working backwards here... The server ended up taking it back because we had already finished our dessert and he was fine taking it back.   Paid $33 for poor service, fruit flies and poorly positioned exterior decal."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday afternoon. $26 for all you can eat.  Virtually all of the sushi and sashimi was tasteless, especially the salmon which tells me that their fish is NOT fresh and had been thawed out from some generic frozen fish supplier.  At least that is what I am hoping, else they were just using old fish that had been sitting around too long.  Their cooked dishes were mediocre to good, but nothing to brag about.  Apart from being able to continually order with a tablet computer (which was very efficient and cool) I can't think of anything in this place to recommend it any more than any of the other hundreds of AYCE sushi places that are popping up throughout the Toronto and the GTA."}
{"text":"The service isnt the best but honestly the food was pretty good. Its one of the more memorable sushi AYCE places for me."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi for a great price! Can't complain about that!  We didn't have AYCE, but found that the prices were pretty good. The sushi combos were very filling for 1 person and around $11-$15.  The maki tastes pretty good, but I found the rice to be more on the soft/mushier side compared to other sushi places. I prefer to have my maki rice cooked with a little more texture. But my sister ordered the Chirashi Don, which is Sashimi over a bed of rice, and I really liked the rice on its own. They sprinkle some Japanese seasoning on top of it to give it extra flavour.  I tried \"Deep Fried Milk\" for the first time and I must say that it's pretty interesting... There's a semi-sweet creamy milk custard/pudding filling on the inside of deep-fried tempura with chocolate fondue on the side. 5 pieces for $3.99. If you like deep fried banana, but want to try something more soft, I would recommend trying this.  The service here is pretty good. Although the waitresses don't smile much, they are polite for the most part. The food comes really fast compared to most sushi places I've been to! We just finished ordering and we got our soup and salad within 2 minutes! So if you're starving, the good news is that you won't have to wait long.  I also really like the interior. It's very modern and cozy.  I would definitely come here again. Especially since you get 5% off for paying with cash. ;)"}
{"text":"I went last night for the first time since the reno.  I'm not so into sushi so I ordered spring rolls, sweet potato tempura, beef onion rolls, chicken skewers, sirloin beef and garlic, and orange peel chicken. everything was really good, meat was good quality, yum yum.  now the bad part  my fiance ordered avocado rolls, cucumber rolls, and salmon rolls.  she didn't make it to the car before throwing up.  we think the fish must have been bad because she felt better afterwards.  if you go here be very careful that everything is fresh"}
{"text":"Called up Sushi Kiku, York mills, on Monday afternoon to check for All you can eat lunch. was told the last order is at 230  (lunch hours are 11 to 3).  two of us reached at 220 and were bluntly told the lunch time is over. We were asked to order dinner. I wish the staff was honest on the phone.  We were hungry and wanted to have sushi so ordered and had dinner at 3 spending $24 per person instead of $16 for lunch.  After a disappointing start, we ordered Sashimi - it came in odd cuts, some pieces were thin some others were oddly shaped, salmon was not fresh.  To our further surprise, they did not serve green tea with food.   One chicken dish was so awful my daughter almost threw out along with Tuna which had strange taste.  I went there after my earlier visit to the Markham location where we enjoyed the food though the service was terrible, but North York Sushi Kiku would beat their counterparts in worse service. Never again."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here and I enjoyed my food at Sushi Kiku, although I think that Heart land Sushi can put Kiku to shame.   I wish the ingredients were fresher, (avocado felt like it was soggy)but I really like the fact that I was able to order my food with an ipad (makes ordering super quick without having to wait for a waitress).  They only had ice cream on the lunch buffet menu, which was a shame, I~m not sure whether they have more variety on their dinner menu (I hope so), if not, I wouldn't bother spending 23$ on dinner here.  Overall, I think I will be coming back. The waitress' were friendly and kept filling up my water and cleaning the table which was nice."}
{"text":"All you can east Sushi place. The food is good but servers are catastrophe.  Sounds they are not happy with their job. Nevertheless, good place to eat LOTS of sushi if you are into all you can eat"}
{"text":"I am of the belief that putting \"all you can eat\" and \"Japanese\" together is equivalent to putting \"low quality ingredients\" and \"potential for food poisoning\" together, which is why I actively try to avoid all you can eat Japanese places (AYCEJPs). So I was pleasantly surprised when I was cornered into coming here in a party of 6 for dinner. Per person, it was $19.99.  Compared to other AYCEJPs I have been to, Sushi Kiku had a wider variety of sashimi and sushi, including white tuna and cuttlefish sashimi and flying fish roe sushi. Aforesaid items were also cool (read: at a slower-rate-of-bacteria-breeding temperature). The Black Dragon roll was also pretty good, with the right amount of rice. The cooked items were pretty good too, including the shrimp tempura that was light and crispy. AND I didn't get food poisoning, so that's definitely a plus.   I still prefer places that are not AYCE, but I'd come here again as my first choice of AYCEJP if I had to."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is terrible. Extremely rude servers and we had to flag down the server every time we needed anything... Overall - pass."}
{"text":"Things have gone up a notch at Kiku Sushi.  Since the renovation (due to fire?) we've been keeping our eyes peeled for when it reopened.  The food is absolutely top notch on flavor and service was friendly with no sense of being rushed.  Specialty rolls were awesome.    Definitely take another look at this great all you can eat sushi restaurant.  One final note, for those of you who like condensed milk (ish) deep fried things - give the Deep Fried Milk a try, it was kinda cool."}
{"text":"This used to be our main neighborhood sushi spot, our go-to on Sunday nights. Lately though, Kiku has failed to maintain its level of service and quality of food.  Staff are usually pleasant enough, though there's been a few times we've been rushed out of the restaurant after paying and one highly unusual time where we were scolded for paying with a credit card? But besides that, mostly good service. (Note: we used to be regulars here, so our faces are pretty familiar. Also, we specifically avoid this one lady at all costs, which is probably why this service review is better than most.)  The restaurant is never too busy, which is kind of nice. The seating is comfortable and they'll let you pick where you want to sit if you're particular. The decoration is nothing special, but not outdated, and the restaurant is pretty casual.  They have switched from paper menus to iPad, which is very convenient for their all-you-can-eat but can be hard at times for a la cart because no one is there to serve you. Also, you have to do a lot of scrolling to see the whole menu.  The fish quality is really what's gone down in the last year. My family is a longtime lover of Ikura (salmon roe), but found it EXTREMELY fishy and salty the last few times. On more than one occasion, we have also found their Ika (squid) and Salmon to be slimy. Their rice is pretty good though, and their tempura can get soggy but has also maintained a good rep.  I wish I could give this place a better review, but unfortunately it seems it's been pretty downhill for Kiku. They've recently stopped delivery and only do pick-up. I hope they can improve and come back to their old self!"}
{"text":"This spot is a favourite of a friend and his roommate, mostly because they are students and anywhere that is all-you-can-eat that is good is a bonus to them.  They talked about it a lot, so of course we had to go when I was visiting Toronto last week.  I've had pretty good experiences with all-you-can-eat sushi places in Toronto, this place now included.  We went at lunch time, so the $13.95 price was great for the value.  Inside is a very clean and simple decor, nothing overwhelming and not too dull that you are bored.  We had a great laugh at the fact that they were playing Kenny G's Christmas album as background music (as identified by my friend's roommate - apparently his parents are fans).  I was told that they actually play this music all the time, which is ok though because it's not too loud to be distracting.  I found the quality of the food to be quite good.  The rolls stayed together, not too much rice was used, and orders were presented relatively quickly.  The salmon on this particular day was absolutely delicious and a fave of mine is now the Green Dragon Roll.  Miso soup was also acceptable, not too salty or anything like that.  (Actually, just writing this review now is making me hungry for sushi!)  Service was quick and efficient and there was no wait to get water refills, they're always there!  Everyone that was working on that afternoon was quite pleasant.  So, definitely check this place out if you are in this area and have an empty stomach to fill, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this all-you-can-eat.  Enjoy the music too, but let me know if they change the CD!!"}
{"text":"First time writing a review and I had to because the food here is completely bland. I had ordered the Miso Chicken Ramen and was completely disappointed. The broth tasted like hot water and flavoured by the large amount of broccoli. The chicken that came on top of the soup was also completely bland and slightly flavoured from the sauce they had put on top. My girlfriend had ordered the Don Katsu which was overpowered by the egg batter and ample amounts of onion that layered the dish. If it weren't for the onions, that dish would have had zero flavour as well. This was the first time I have ever experienced such bland food and created an account just for this to warn others so they do not experience what I am currently eating."}
{"text":"This is not authentic quality sushi, but if you like all you can eat it is probably the best AYCE I've been to, including places in Markham and downtown. The rolls are nicely prepared and fresh and there spider roll is really good and not burnt or overly fried. All the tempura was fried instantly and hot. The salmon sashimi and sushi is good but I did not like the white tuna. My favorite rolls: green dragon, black dragon, spider roll (soft shell crab), spicy salmon, bbq eel with avocado.  The cooked items are also pretty good including: salmon asparagus, eggplant, tempura, beef ribs, beef roll with enoki mushrooms, salmon terriyaki, fried banana, etc...  The place is never too full and they take reservations too. I have never waited to eat here before.   Service is decent and they refill your green tea all the time! Although one time the waitress spilled soya sauce on me and I didn't even get a discount - just a bunch of napkins to wipe it up. that was disappointing and I should have complained."}
{"text":"Beware!   The food at the York Mills location is very disappointing compared to their Commerce Valley location! I had been to the Commerce Valley location recently and was very impressed with the variety of food and excellent culinary skills of their chef. I assumed that there would be some consistency in food with their other location at York Mills, but was sorely mistaken...  Not only that, but the dinner menu at York Mills contains only 70% of the items that can be found at their Commerce Valley location. Considering that this is a franchise, I am shocked that they actually have a smaller and different menu. The chef at York Mills also overcooked the cooked food including the salmon teriyaki, steak, etc.  I had recommended the York Mills location for my dad's birthday and was embarrassed once we tasted the food and saw that the menu was so limited (including the desserts).  This is my first time creating an account on Yelp, with the primary purpose of posting this review. I don't want others to make the same mistake I did. Cheers and happy dining!"}
{"text":"Clean efficient service. Expect food to arrive at your table a few short minutes after submitting order. Ordering is done using an iPad. Pictures! Perfect system for those of us who can't remember the names. Selected food was very good and fresh.  One complaint was the  chicken  teriyaki. Chicken was dry and lacked flavour. A la carte is perfect if your companions are not big eaters. The AYCE options is always there for the over achievers. Good value. Will return."}
{"text":"Food was decent but service was absolutely terrible. Waitresses were lazy and apathetic, but since ordering is done via ipad it was tolerable. However as closing time approached, the server began to repeatedly tell us how long we had until we had to leave. Unbelievably, at the stroke off ten, the server actually took our unfinished meals while we were still eating ads told us to leave. Did the same with the customers. Never going back."}
{"text":"worst Sushi Restaurant I have ever tried. All tempura are deep fried with oil that been used defiantly more than a month. Scallops are from the can."}
{"text":"Served a plate with black muck on it. Also, servers are quite rude and loud and disturbing. Food was alright, a bit messy but still tasted okay. The side dish we ordered came but it was obvious that it was refrigerated overnight. Not best quality food."}
{"text":"Always consistent and really good food. Sashimi is fresh and the service is always very quick!  Nothing to complain about, its great!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Service was prompt and fast but food was below average. The grill salmon was too dry and the steak was not that appealing either. Sushi was only ok, not amazing but not so bad that you'll get sick from it. Most dishes I ordered from the kitchen were a bit on the bland side; stir fried noodles kind of reminded me of the lacklustre attempt of my university's cafeteria. Maybe I caught them on an off day, and it seems like this is a new location so perhaps they are still working out the kinks, but reality is, I most likely won't go back again."}
{"text":"I'm not often in this area, but the other night, we ended up here, hoping it could cure a sushi craving.   AYCE sushi restaurants seem to be forced to step their game up lately; there are so many more places opening up all around the GTA. I've been to some really bad AYCE places (like Sushi Mountain in Ajax, unfortunately) and I'm happy to say Sushi Kiku falls on the brighter end of the spectrum.  We ordered a craaaaapload of food, with a mix of cooked items, sushi rolls, sashimi, salads, etc. I liked pretty much all of the rolls; they were made neatly, not too big and even though they arrived at our table super quickly, they weren't made in a rush.  Our cooked items were also tasty: we had udon (both fried and soup); mixed tempura, enoki musrooms, and a whole bunch of other meats that were all hot and served promptly.  Stuffed and happy, we still left room for some deep fried milk (a must have!) and a scoop of ice cream. I ordered the tiramisu too, which was a bit off...but, hey, I don't go to sushi joints for Italian desserts, jeez.  Even on a busy night (we went on Good Friday), we were seated and served efficiently. The staff are attentive and polite. Our dirty dishes were cleared away smoothly to make room for all the food coming in, and our water and tea was constantly being replenished. Refilling my drink --- this makes such a huge impact on my experience, no matter WHERE I am eating.  The price was average for an all you can eat (24$/person, holiday dinner pricing), but the quality of the food was definitely better and I'd love to come back next time I'm around here."}
{"text":"Eschewed the \"All You Can Eat\" option and went with the Bento box lunch special. When comparing volume of food to price, this was a great deal. Bottomless green tea, miso soup, salad, veggie bento box which included tempura vegetables (tempura good, veggies overcooked), cucumber and avocado sushi (avocado overripe), deep fried tofu, pan fried mixed veggies and rice.  All of this for 8 bucks, tax in.  Think about it though. Cheap, hearty lunch specials, inexpensive \"All You Can Eat\" option...really, how much care and quality could they put into their food?  I miss Crazy Sushi, which used to inhabit this location."}
{"text":"A Horrible experience!  The staff are rude, the customer service has not exist in this place!  I can't believe what I've experienced in here.  Please do yourself a favor and avoid  this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant before, both at this location and their hwy 7 one and loved their food. Great deal but I was quite disappointed this time when I ordered off their a la carte menu. We ordered a caterpillar tool but there was hardly a trace of bbq eel. Not to mention the terrible service! Our waitress just threw our food on the table and had the worst attitude. It was as if we were her worst enemies. Apparently this happens all the time when the manager's not around."}
{"text":"The last time I went to Sushi Kiku two years ago, I had a completely different experience compared to my experience last weekend.  Needless to say, the service was awful. When my sister and I first walked in, nobody even came by to tell us how long the wait would be, or that they would be with us momentarily.  I waited a few minutes, and finally went up to a waiter to ask her how long it would be, because it was a full restaurant. I understand they were busy, but they also seemed understaffed.  The only time the wait staff came by without me asking was to take our order. Luckily we were sitting by the POS system, so somebody was always nearby.   I got the chicken teriyaki bento box, which was OK. I also ordered some mango and green tea ice cream in the end which was not bad either. The food in my opinion was very standard.  Unfortunately the service just ruined the whole experience for me. I will not be coming back in the future, sorry Kiku."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  We had a big group from the office there for lunch.  The owner or chef came out to \"inform\" us in a loud and less than pleasant tone that we should order all from one sheet instead of so many different sheets.  Okay I get that, but there is a right way and a wrong way of communicating.  Anyhow, we didn't have much time and just ate there.  Food was sloppy even for AYCE.  I don't expect high quality or good presentation, but at least wipe the dishes down.  Such a low budget Mickey Mouse production.  Also looks like some of their \"sushi\" chefs were more concerned about their cellphone calls than the food they were making. Terrible."}
{"text":"This is my thrid time getting take out from them.  The lunch Bento box is pretty big and comes in it own brown paper bag. It is like a happy meal for adults.  And for $7.50  I say it is a bargain.  You get Miso soup, Green salad, 6 piece California Roll ,2 tofu,mixed veggie, bowl of rice and your main course (salmon, beef, etc).    I tried the Salmon and Beef Bento and both have been good to me.  I also gotten the Black Dragon roll and it was as good as other sushi places I been too."}
{"text":"Kiku sushi was actually better than I expected. It is one of my favourite all you can eat japanese restaurants. It is not the best japanese restaurant you can find, but its only $20 for dinner. For $20 you could eat cuttle fish sushi which is my favourite, flying fish roe sushi,six different types of sashimi, shrimp tempura, ramen, and many more. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Walked in to an empty restaurant, that should have been my first sign.   Worst sushi I have ever had and they server was so rude, I actually left 0 tip! They counted our shrimp and complained because there was two left.  The waitress stood in the empty restaurant staring at you table the whole time ( see photo )"}
{"text":"They have a lunch special for around 9$+ tax and tip that u can't beat, choice of short ribs, beef, chicken, tempura.  As an Ayce it's not the best, quality is good, but just the preparation and presentation isn't \"wow\"  iPad ordering is cool tho."}
{"text":"These people are so lovely and the food is great!! I ordered sushi and a serve of Gyoza and they threw in a Miso soup! Lovely- will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"More or less like your typical ayce sushi place. Here are some bullet points  - ordered a mango slush drink for 3.60. Very diluted mango taste, if any. 4/10 (ended up ordering some mango ice cream and putting it in the rest of my drink lol but even the mango ice cream taste is different) - baked mussels were pretty good. 8/10 - breaded scallop was mostly hollow inside. What did they do to the scallop?!? 4/10 - shrimp tempura - shrimp itself was pretty huge, but managed to be even bigger with a huge load of batter. 6/10 - beef ribs were hot and tasty. 8.5/10 - miso soup was a bit diluted. 6/10 - sushi and sashimi were generally decent for an ayce place. 7.5/10 - deep dried milk was interesting. 7/10 - ipad ordering was pretty easy. Food came fairly quickly.  Okay food, speedy service. Prob won't return tho, since I don't really do ayce much anymore-just today cuz I was craving loads of food.  6/10 for quality, 8/10 for service. 7/10 for value. 6.5/10 overall (not an average)"}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to try the sushi here this evening (just something quick after work). We ordered take out and got the Sushi and Sashimi Party Tray. To start off, the tray itself isn't the cheapest, compared to some of the better restaurants/sushi places I've been to. Their sushi and sashimi were not fresh whatsoever. They tasted old and warm. The quality of the sushi was extremely poor - it's almost as if they don't care how the sushi are presented to their customers. This will be the first and last time I'll ever have sushi here."}
{"text":"No matter what kind of sushi or sashimi you like, order the SALMON! It is the freshest Salmon I have ever had. OMG!! it melts in your mouth.  The service is good, and I like that you can order from and Ipad, which makes the food turnaround faster.  The bento boxes are huge, I usually share with my mom and order some extra rolls. Their miso soup is pretty good too.  Last time we went here, we ordered green tea, but I hated that the cup smelled like Chorine. Not what I want my green tea to smell like.  They also changed management recently, and the menu is different.We decided to try a specialty roll that had warm scallops and mushrooms on top, and what a huge miss it was! Never try to put anything hot on top of raw fish, it just doesn't go together."}
{"text":"Out of desperation, I stumbled upon Kiku during the Canada Day long weekend for dinner.  Kiku is, hands down, the BEST AYCE sushi place that I've ever been to in terms of quality and selection. There are a great deal of specialty rolls on the menu, which is a huge plus for any AYCE sushi joint.  I came here with a group of 5 hungry athletes and we ordered a great deal of sushi that day, but here are a couple of my highlights and must-trys: -dynamite hand roll (tons of hand rolls on the menu) -red snapper sushi (some of the freshest red snapper I've ever had at an AYCE restaurant) -rainbow roll (fresh fish up top... make or break for a rainbow roll) -calamari tempura roll (huge and full of flavor)  Our food was served faster than any other AYCE place that I've ever been to, and they were quite busy that day. It was $24 for the AYCE dinner menu since it was a holiday. I think I definitely got my money's worth.   Why not 5 stars? The waitresses were quite cold and very irritable. We had asked our waitress a question and she gave us a bit of an eye roll, a big exhale and walked away to yell at the sushi chefs. I'd like to think I rolled up here with a good group of people that were pretty low maintenance, but the servers just seemed very unhappy and annoyed. A step up in customer service will give them a 5. Til then, I'll enjoy my food and substandard service."}
{"text":"Respectable sushi and pan-asian food at an all you can eat price.   I probably wouldn't have found this place without Yelp reviews. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall that I wouldn't go to often otherwise at Leslie and York Mills. My experience with all-you-can-eat Sushi has typically been that it's pretty awful.  Sushi Kiku is definitely not the nicest sushi that I've ever had, but it's pretty decent, and for the all-you-can-eat tradeoff, well above average. It'll beat most grocery store and buffet sushi handily, but it's probably not going to come that close to your favorite sushi spot.  You order your food, rather than pick it from a buffet, and they're pretty consistently good. There's a few dishes that stand out for me (Sirloin, Basa Filet, Beef & Enoki Mushroom, Cold Tofu, Unagi) and a few I wouldn't order again (Las Vegas Roll), but most are just good.  So -- lots of good, most of it good, and a flat fee."}
{"text":"Before I say anything else, the service here is AWFUL. Consistently, too.   I used to come here at least once a week. Lots to choose from on the menu, and the staff were really nice. I also would order delivery from here maybe 2-3 times a week (yeah, it was an addiction).  Sadly, I now do neither of those things. Delivery is now a minimum of $50, with a $5 delivery charge... Higher than any other restaurant that delivers in my area. Also, after the renovations from a fire, they seem to be cutting costs by keeping very few staff... And keeping the staff that obviously hate their job.   My sister, niece and I were there this week and it didn't go all that well. We arrived at 11:30 (it opens at 11)... And they seemed annoyed we were even there. They told us they were still cleaning and prepping so it would be at least another 10 mins before we could order. When we were finally allowed to order, we got drinks. My sister got a piña colada, which tasted like soap-- like they didn't quite rinse the glass completely. She waved the server over and explained that she'd like an iced tea instead because her current drink kind of tastes like soap. She went to tell her manager, who came over to tell us sternly that that's the taste of a piña colada-- the pineapple juice makes it taste that way. My sister said she'd still like another drink. Manager says we still have to pay for it. My sister says fine. They LEAVE the soap-drink on our table for the REST OF OUR MEAL. Seriously.   The drink debacle left a bad taste in our mouths (literally) and the meal was pretty much ruined.  The servers barely came over to clear the table.   I'm just so over this place. They should just close and find another restaurant to take over because it's a great space."}
{"text":"This sushi place had the worst service. I didn't like the rice and the whole service team turned against me. The waitress actually tossed the bill at me across the table. Please don't give them your service!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment many times but stopped coming a few years ago because of the attitude from the staff. Recently, I went to their other restaurant in Richmond Hill and fell in love with their sashimi - so fresh and it melts in your mouth. So we thought we'd give this place a chance again. It is closer for us to travel to and we thought it might have improved over the past few years. Nope. The woman who \"greeted\" us at the door (I use greeted but it was more like barked at us) pointed to a table for us to sit at. The phone rang, she grabbed it and was grunting to someone on the other end and throwing our chopsticks and plates on the table. The menu is an iPad, so that cut down her \"facetime\" with us. Each dish that came to our table was either accompanied by silence or more grunting. The food was mediocre at best. Nowhere near the quality of the other restaurant. In my opinion, it's worth the drive to Richmond Hill. Next!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this place. I do not recommend this place at all. Cost for all you can eat is $19.99 per person. There's a reason why it's cheap. Food quality is not good. Extremely thin layer of raw fish on your sushi. You will definitely get full from the eating rice. Also, there's a note at the door saying extra food will get charged. Most importantly there's no sashimi at this restaurant. That's probably why the sashimi slices on the sushi is so pathetic. Red bean ice-cream taste like strawberry and  playing Christmas  song... Lol  Horrible experience....sigh."}
{"text":"Well, after I decided to come check out this place with my family after hearing a lot of appraisal from my mother and her friends.   The decor of this restaurant is very warm and welcoming. The service was very decent where the waiters were friendly and wanting to make our meal a pleasurable experience.  The waiters were very attentive and they come around constantly to clear the table, which was great since we were running out of space for our food since we ordered a lot in the first round.   The food was very delicious from the All You Can Eat menu. They have the classics (Tempura, Miso Soup, Ramen, Maki, Sashimi) and they have some new items I have not heard of before like Sushi Pizza.  I was very impressed with the freshness and quality of the seafood , especially from the yellowtail and salmon sashimi we ordered.  The restuarant offers a lot of specialty rolls, which was very pleasant to see as I was interested in tasting some of the flavour combinations.   This establishment is a great place if you just want to sit back, enjoy some Japanese cuisine, and have a great time with family and friends."}
{"text":"Sushi is always fresh. This is my go-to sushi restaurants for years now. Staff is very nice and the all you can eat is always satisfying. I've eaten in and done take-out and would high recommend both. Price is comparable and they are very kid friendly.   The sushi rolls are large and unlike most places, I'd recommend the sushi pizza.   So, when you find yourself looking for that sushi kick, I highly recommend the Kiku."}
{"text":"Do not eat here unless you want to be forced to eat way too much food. I just wanted to order something small from the menu because I'm not hungry but my daughters wanted all you can eat. I was told I would also have to order all you can eat or go and sit at another table by myself. I didn't want to eat so much and I wasn't allowed to stay and eat nothing so I left. What a terrible experience. No wonder there wasn't a single person in this restaurant. It's cold and boring and the customer service is terrible. They are only interested in ramming as much as possible down their customers throats. Including bad attitude. Avoid."}
{"text":"Officially one of my favourite AYCE sushi places. You can find the full menu on their website (www.sushikiku.com) and their prices. I ate at the Markham location where you're able to order on an iPad. Once we sent out the order it started coming within less than 5 minutes. Super quick service! Waiters are constantly around and clearing your table   The food was really good. I really love their menu, which is probably the reason why I love this place so much. It has everything. Mussels covered in cheese, mango yogurt, creme brûlée, beef tataki, seaweed salad, mango roll, deep fried milk, mango ice cream, coconut shrimp  The one thing that really erked me was, I called the day before asking about their beef tataki if it was covered in pepper (I saw a yelp photo of the beef tataki having too much pepper) and the manager said I could request it to be made without pepper since it's made to order. Once I got there and ordered it though he told me it was already covered in pepper and they couldn't do anything about it. This really upset me because the reason I love dinner so much is because of beef tataki   Other than that I really love this place and the menu. I do plan on eating here again. Oh I do not recommend their pancake; it's huge and it's nothing like the picture. If the yorkmills location is the same quality as this place I recommend going there since it's $2 cheaper and the difference between the menus isn't that much (more dessert options in Markham location)"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here but the service is terrible.  Sushi Legend at Leslie and finch is better =]"}
{"text":"iPad ordering allows quicker service for the customers and the seaweed in the hand rolld and maki rolls is what i noticed; it was super crispy and dry. I really prefer the rolls with seaweed like this and in some AYCE Sushi restaurants you dont really get this kind of quality. Tasted fresh and everything on the menu is on point ! Definitely my go to ayce place this year !"}
{"text":"Pretty much our favourite AYCE place uptown...never had a bad meal here and we've been coming since they replaced crazy sushi. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed  *Edit*  I will never step foot in this restaurant again. The food is still fine but the service is atrocious. I had lunch with my 1 yr old daughter and was charged $5 for her to eat. It's not the cost so much as the server yelling at me while the manager stood there. When I asked him if he cared about losing a customer he simply shrugged and said no."}
{"text":"The food was quite delicious and wasn't busy when I checked out this place but it wasn't spectacular. The food was tasty (though the chicken items were bland) and the service was decent. I enjoyed the ice cream and the chicken fried rice the most. Sushi was delicious but avoid the chicken teriyaki roll at all costs! Dry, hard to eat and didn't sit well at all! I do like that you can place your order on the iPad instead of trying to get the attention of the waitress, so that is a plus. Overall decent but not spectacular."}
{"text":"I'm still startled by the service I received as mentioned in my previous review, but my previous review says nothing about their food or their value.  Ordered takeout from here on New Year's. Thankfully, they were open. I've never had a terrible food experience here. I just haven't ordered here in a while. Last time I came, they had pretty good bento box sets. I enjoy bento boxes because usually, they give you a good amount of food for a fairly reasonable price. Sushi Kiku's bento boxes are no different. I ordered a salmon terriyaki bento box ($13.95) and it came with 3 pieces of salmon sashimi, 6 pieces of California roll, miso soup, salad (dressing served on the side), 2 shrimp tempura and 5 of the largest pieces of veggie tempura I've ever seen (2 yam, 1 zucchini, 1 eggplant, 1 broccoli), 2 decent sized pieces of salmon terriyaki, 2 pieces of agedashi tofu, and rice. I'm not a small eater, but I only managed to finish sashimi, the sushi, and the tempura before I gave up...and this was at dinner. Taste-wise, everything was not bad. The tempura was crispy. The salmon sashimi was, for lack of better words, creamy (and slightly warm, but that's probably because I ordered takeout and it was packed with all the hot food, so I won't dock them marks on that), the California roll was freshly made (I'm not pleased when I find avocado in my rolls that is turning brown). I heard the miso soup had enoki mushrooms in it.  I'll come again for the food. Hopefully, their service gets better."}
{"text":"I had just arrived at around 1:45pm and was given a table. Nearly immediatly, before I even had a chance to look at the menu, i was asked if i was ready to order. When I replied in the negative, this same waitress asked me again three times in under one minute intervals. Feeling rushed, I quickly ordered the Salmon Udon Soup. With generous servings of broccoli and other assorted vegetables it was nutritious, but the soup itself was insipid. Still, the meal was satisfying enough and the portions were generous."}
{"text":"Being an avid sushi lover, I love to try out different places to eat. My brother recommended this place since it was close to his workplace. We were seated quickly and decided to get the A La Carte lunch specials. The lady asked us what we wanted to wanted to drink, and I had said tea.  Food is alright, wasn't anything special but for the price I was happy. However, when we got the bill, I noticed we were charged $1 for tea. Now $1 is nothing, but I would have liked it if the server had let us know there was a charge for it. I've been to so many sushi places, and I've never been charged for tea.   I told the server that I wasn't aware there was a charge for tea, and if I had known, I wouldn't have ordered tea. She insists that she told us (she did not), and stomps away from me while I'm still talking to her.  I hear angry yells, and her manager comes over accusing me that I should be smarter when I order drinks. That when you go to other places to order drinks, you would be charged. I told him I understood that for sodas or other things, but not for tea. I told him I would pay the $1 no problem, but for future reference, it'd be nice to let the customers know there would be a charge for it.   The manager gives me an insincere apology, and gives me the bill. I still tipped them because the food and service was okay up until the billing, but honestly, would not come back here again because of the way they treated this minor thing. The manager left me to pay, and I heard more yells and laughter my direction.   If they had just apologized from the beginning, i would have happily been on my way, paid the $1, and I wouldn't have left this review here.  Disappointed, and seriously, don't even bother."}
{"text":"I was waaaay outside of my neighbourhood the other day and was craving some sushi for lunch so I hit up my handy-dandy Yelp app to find recommendations that led me to Kiku.  It's located in a little plaza so there is plenty of parking. The restaurant itself is small and clean. The staff is friendly and efficient.  I found the selection for their AYCE lunch just alright. I was disappointed with the nigiri. Little bits and pieces of fish piled together. No proper sushi cuts. Oh well. It tasted alright. I have absolutely had better. Though I have also had worse.   All in all this place is fine. If I found myself in the area again I would probably check out another place but if someone I was to dine with suggested going here, I would return."}
{"text":"I miss the crazy sushi that left its decor behind but took away it's quality and customer service.  This is a mediocre AYCE sushi place.  They charge for toddlers under 2! Can you believe it?  My son has a couple of pieces and they charged us 4.50.  Very unwelcoming to families.  When questioned regarding the charge for the boy all they could say was that it was policy. After, all of us felt ill would added to the terrible experience.   Regarding the food: it was over priced for a weekend and the quality was very low.  Cookie cutter sushi piece (made from moulds) and tasteless fish.  The tempura shrimp was the only good thing but took too long to come out of the kitchen which surprised me considering that there was only one other family. I'm am sad that the place is bad.  The reviews are misleading."}
{"text":"If I could leave -5 stars I would have!  They were applying a very non ethical trick which was leaving a big gap between every dish! Considering it's an all you can eat restaurant, they were supposedly serving us continuously  we were bored and full by the end of second dish due to the big cap between every dish.  We were a big group of 16 people, 2 of us didn't want to eat, so they made them to sit separately on some other table! A business should treat their clients based on trust and respect which was barely sensible in this place.  The place was an absolute mess! The staff were Extremely RUDE( unbelievably rude) and disrespectful. The server threw the napkins and eventually the bill in our table. I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE of my life! I was suffering from food poisoning   A day after while I was traveling.  All in all stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Nestled in a plaza at York Mills and Leslie in North York is a all you can eat Japanese restaurant. In terms of AYCE, this restaurant provides a variety of items all ordered on an iPad. This iPad ordering was neat, never made any mistakes with it. The service was quick to clear plates and refill drinks. However they don't smile or greet you at the door - just a bunch of awkward staff. Okay! so the food isn't bad for AYCE. The sushi and maki rolls portions are great because they aren't try to fill you with rice like other places. The shrimp tempura was really good! Overall pretty good and satisfied my sushi cravings."}
{"text":"The all you can eat is tempting but the sushi is not that great. The service is bad. I think the manager should do something about it. I like their eggplant and tempura sushi."}
{"text":"They have good selection of food, and the food there are fresh and tasty. I come here constantly for lunch, it's a good ayce place.   Why I gave it a 4 stars because my friend used to work there and know that the waitresses their don't get tips. This is probably the reason why a lot people here complaining about their service."}
{"text":"orders are done with an ipad.  this means very accurate orders.  orders you will get.  unlike other restaurants.  service is pretty good.  reservations are mandatory.  food is pretty good.  the salmon is very good.  fresh and big portions.  tempura is good too.  the batter is spot on."}
{"text":"My little sister has often raved about this place since it's a block away from her high school and she often comes here for lunch so, today me and her decided to come by and check it out.   Due to its location, the place was mediocre and quiet when we came in at 1:00PM. Once we were seated, the waitress came and asked what we would like to drink and left. The all you can eat menu is right there at the table for you to go through and mark down what you would like to eat. It did get a bit busy as the minutes ticked by but, the service did not lack at all. The waiters and waitresses came around to check on us very frequently (every 5-10 minutes, which was great). As for food, it was quick. Once we gave the menu in, waited approximately 2 minutes for the salad to come and about 3 minutes for the first 2 rolls to come. All of our orders after that were consistent and we were left full and satisfied.  In the end, our total was $32 for 2 people which in my opinion is not bad at all, considering we came here on a weekend (Sunday). Most sushi places would be charging you at least $20 or more per person on weekends while this place keeps the same price for lunch for all 7 days of the week which I think is exceptionally great. $14.50 for lunch, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I think ever since they introduced the iPad mode of ordering, it's gotten a lot worse, in my opinion. I don't even go here anymore, and there are much better AYCE places. Once upon a time it was decent, but not so much anymore. Sorry, Kiku..."}
{"text":"First of all the servers are not very friendly. We came before 3pm and they told me we could only do dinner ayce, which was fine, but the menu doesn't have a lot of choices compare to every sushi ayce place i've ever been. The sashimi fish wasn't fresh at all, especially the tuna had a wierd color, and everything else doesn't taste good at all.  I wasn't happy to pay $30 for this late lunch/early dinner, and also wasn't happy to drove uptown just for this restaurant. Wouldn't come again for sure."}
{"text":"I went in and looked at the menu. There was very little options. It was like a lunch ayce restaurant. The price was expensive considering the food selection. The sushi was average. I just wish they had more options. The service was bad. The server was rude and not welcoming."}
{"text":"Ordered off the AYCE menu (they have iPads) food came fast and to temperature. Decent variety of menu items (didn't have a lot of special rolls though). Servers were attentive even though they were super busy that night.   I recommend coming here for all you can eat, however probably best not on a weekend as the pricing is a bit more for the same stuff."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat deal is pretty good - good service, modern decor, friendly staff.  Seems to be building a loyal clientel as well."}
{"text":"So I came here today with some of my fire buds as one their recommendations. We ordered food via Ipad, but there was 8 of us so it took some time for all of us to order. The food however didn't seem to be the freshest of fish I've eaten. The salmon sushi had a dark dry texture and I was kind of skeptical about eating it. I was right about how it looked because that's how it tasted... very dry. The other food we ordered tasted more fresh, which was weird seeing how some was really dry.   Overall this wasn't bad. Maybe some days they have fresher salmon or certain types of fish. Service is a meh for me wasn't too spectacular just seemed average to me. The parking is quite hectic as it's beside a longos. So Goodluck with parking or try the back!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! They have cut somethings from the menu, but this place is getting and worst and worst. Took my mom here and we will never go again."}
{"text":"Second time I review this place. I wish I could rate them 5 stars like they deserve if it wasn't for their terrible service. I have been to this restaurant for about 7 times now. Again, never disappointed with the food but always with the service. The woman literary throws you the plates and spills the water but doesn't apologize or clean it. Last time I asked her to please clean my table because it was sticky and she told me to move somewhere else instead and left. I didn't want to move so I asked her to just give me a clothe and I will do it if she wants but she said that they didn't have clothes and left again. Then another server came and cleaned our table. The service of this specific waitress is so terrible (she is always there) that me and my dad have decided to change sushi places and started to go to this other sushi restaurant called Matsuda. Such a shame because I love the food and how fast they are at making it but after giving them  multiple chances, we decided that we can't handle the ridiculous  service of this place."}
{"text":"One of the worst service I ever had in my life! The waitresses were very rude, they seemed miserable, and obviously hated their jobs. The food was hit or miss. Nothing great or special. Ultimately, avoid if you can. They didn't even give us our change after we paid. Come here if you want to pay to be treated awfully. Definitely never returning."}
{"text":"Food is consist. Overall food is pretty good and staff is attentive enough. Arctic roll is so good and fried milk for dessert!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious but the service is very slow."}
{"text":"Food is okay, not great. Service does not exist. One server just throws the plates down. I did not receive any comments when i saif thank you. One of the server, just ignored me at the end of the day. I wouldn't go back there again."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place another chance by going for the second time and found hair in my food, both times. Now maybe I just had bad luck at this place but the last time I was there, we asked the waitress to remove the plate with the piece of hair, quietly* since we did not want to disgust costumers around us so she became rude about it by giving us a dirty look and avoiding our table. There must have been a better way of dealing with that issue...   Their quality of service and food is all dependent upon if you are there for AYCE or not. If you are looking for AYCE, skip out on this one"}
{"text":"WORST restaurant service and management EVER! This place is unfortunately consistently going downhill fast! I've visited here many times but the last three times were absolutely terrible.  I kept thinking maybe the staff were just having a bad day and next time would be better - but that is not the case and I've officially decided that I will never be back here again!  Quality of the food is decent but the customer service is the ABSOLUTE WORST! The servers approach us with a repulsive attitude and they are completely impatient.  Their tone is very very rude! They speak to people in a demeaning way - as if the customers are stupid; they treat people as if they are little kids that need to be disciplined. They are not accommodating at all! I was there last night and simply began to ask the server of the possibility of one of us ordering from the menu and whether or not  the other person would be able to get AYCE -- but before I could even finish my sentence, she cut me off in mid speech and said: \"No, no, no, you cannot do that (in a scolding tone) ... if you want to do that you must sit at different tables (and pointed for one of us to move to the next table)\". The idea of dining in segregation was not had in mind and certainly not a favorable suggestion! We ended up ordering a la cart as a result. When the food arrived, one of the dishes that they brought to the table was incorrect and when trying to explain this to the server, she decided that she needed to initiate a loud argumentative debate instead of taking the time to listen to our concern.  We will definitely never return here.   Oh.. and last but not least .... when I called the restaurant manager to tell him about my bad experience all he said was \"well, everyday is busy\". This is not a justification for rude service = POOR management!."}
{"text":"One of my favorite AYCE Places in Toronto.   Service is consistent, Food is Consistently good.   They do this thing with their white tuna where they sear the edges. Its so yummy.  Its the only way I eat White Tuna Sashimi."}
{"text":"I took my friend here for a quick lunch. We checked online to make sure the place was open. It said it was open at 11 am so we arrived around quarter after then they wernt open yet. A woman opened the door for us and we were seated. A few of the servers were washing down tables and chairs and stocking the tables. There was food all over the floor and nothing was ready yet. If you're going to open at 11 you need to be ready for 11. I've never seen a place doing closing cleaning when they opened first thing. We were then told nothing would be prepped and ready for another 30 min, but we informed them we were having ramen not sushi. Once our ramen came the place was starting to fill up. So maybe being ready ahead of time would make a difference in the service. The ramen sadly was so bland! The broth had no depth and the noodles were so starchy and clumpy and tasted of strait flour. I would normally rant and rave about this place because a lot of their rolls are quite delicious. I'm going to stick to ordering party trays for me and my friends instead since they are always delicious.."}
{"text":"The sushi here is alright. I'd say it's pretty average with the exception of a few dishes like the coconut shrimp which is just awful, covered in globs of mayo. The service, on the other hand, is atrocious. The waitresses always seem like they're annoyed that you're there and really make you feel like a burden. They'll throw plates of food down onto your table and rush away because they couldn't care less if you're satisfied. They'll take away plates of food that aren't even finished yet without asking first and when we were waiting for more food she came and rudely asked \"Are you done yet?\" in a very angry tone. Go elsewhere if you want better sushi and at least half decent service, because you won't get it at Kiku."}
{"text":"I decided to go here to order sushi for take out. I ordered Yam Tempura Roll, Dynamite Roll, and the Chicken Teriyaki Roll. I first asked the lady working in the restaurant if they had a beef roll. (Most other sushi places do) She was unable to understand me and just said no. I also found this place to be expensive. It was over $18 dollars for just the three roll. I have been to other Sushi places that would be $14-$15 and it would come with soup and a salad. When i arrived home i couldn't help but notice how small the rolls were. I have never seen them soo tiny.  All in all i think if i was to go back here i would try eating in."}
{"text":"Average AYCE-quality sushi for a reasonable price. I frequent this location a couple of times a month and usually order off their a la carte menu.   Their a la carte pricing for bento boxes and chirashi are relatively inexpensive so I usually opt for that over the AYCE. The food quality is nothing special but hits the spot when I have a craving. Their portion sizes are also pretty good.   The service is usually pretty fast but don't expect any sort of pleasantries with the staff as they are often short and borderline rude. That said they get the job done and are adequate. The use of iPads for doing all of the ordering reduces the amount of interaction you have with the staff which was an improvement."}
{"text":"I visited Sushi Kiku after picking up a package in the plaza.  I was tired and hungry and ordered 4 things.  I got the Tuna on wontons.  It was tasty and but I don't know how good the quality of the tuna was. It was a really large portion though.  I also had a Salmon sushi pizza.  By the time I ate it I was pretty full.  it was good but I would have liked something fresh on top like green onions.  I had a Tuna hand roll.  It was good but I have had better ones.  I also had the gyoza.  They were pretty good, not too greasy but not that flavourful.   Service was good though and the place was decent.  Kind of what is expected from a neighbourhood Sushi place.  Good but not mind blowing."}
{"text":"First of all the food was okey but what really bothered us was its service. Although I am very careful of my actions towards the servers, we didn't get treated well. Every time we were served I said thank you with a smile yet the server was very impolite. When we asked for the bill she said tips weren't included in to the bill, I didn't choose to give a tip because of the behaviour, she told me I had to tip and tried to confront me and I told her I wouldn't tip for such attitude. As I said food was okey and fresh but the staff needs to be changed."}
