{"text":"I go to Feta and Olives in the Atrium for lunch almost every day now.  The food is healthy, prepared fast and very reasonably priced.  The management changed over a few months ago and they've added a bunch of new and delicious items to their salad bar.  They now have quinoa pilaf, beets, coleslaw, Greek salad, orzo pasta, chick peas, couscous, tabbouleh, fiesta bean salad, and a few more.  You can also choose to mix and match as many items as you want if you order a salad or get a side salad as part of a combo with another item.    Their pitas are delicious, especially with the tzatziki sauce and you can customize the toppings on your pitas as well (including anything you want from the salad bar!)  The staff are very friendly and always give out either a $1 coupon or a 10% discount coupon for your next visit too.  It's always an enjoyable experience for me so I highly recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Most of the time, falafel is made from the box which sometimes contains dairy in it so I asked the guy at the counter if the falafel they served contains dairy because I do not consume dairy. He replied in the most condescending tone \"No, it's falafel...it's made out of chickpeas..it's deep fried..\" as if I was stupid or something. Like I was just asking a question lmao I don't understand why he had to be rude but whatever.  Anyways, when he hands me my food, he sarcastically says \"Enjoy.\" with his eyebrows raised. Again, I literally did nothing to him.. maybe he was having a bad day or something but this is no way to speak to customers. When I opened up my falafel pita, the pita was soggy and wet and clearly had been microwaved. The falafel was cold...he didn't even heat it up or anything. It was disgusting. So after I got my food I realized why he told me to \"enjoy\". This man sabotaged my lunch and my day. I was polite, smiled at him, and I received terrible service and probably purposely terrible food. It's incidents like this that make me sad about the world and more disgusted with human beings each and every single day."}
{"text":"I found myself having to grab a bite in this basement foodcourt and was pleasantly surprised with the Mediterranean stand. Healthy, great value and HUGE portions.   Highlight: Falafel dinner. 8.99 for a very large quantity of pretty healthful food. Fed me for two meals and a snack. You can get as many sides and salads as you want (all tasted fresh) with your main."}
{"text":"The falafel wrap was not consistent, based on the last time I had it from here. I would have appreciated my pita to be warmed on the grill some more.The falafel wasn't as crisp and warm as last time. My wrap started to drip and eventually came apart into a mess."}
{"text":"Feta & Olive is located in the Atrium on Bay in the main food court. It's the only Mediterranean style place in this limited food court, so when it opened a while back, my coworkers and I thought that it would be a really good option for lunch. They  have a number of daily specials but I tend to stick to the gyro in a pita and sometimes get a side dish, sometimes not. I've had the souvlaki (chicken) as well and I've tried this and that off the menu.  Like many of the restaurants in this food court, you're best coming to this particular food place if you're in a rush or can't be bothered to walk to the Urban Eatery or the food court at Toronto Life Square. The food here is, at best, uninspired. For Mediterranean food, I'm used to having quite a lot of flavor and the gyro here is the most flavorless I've ever had. Thank god they put tzatziki on it, otherwise it would be rather boring. As well, they don't actually GRILL the gyro before serving it like good places do, its just sort of packed meat mush. And most of the time its not even freshly cut off the spit. They're rather stingy with just about everything that you'd put onto a pita - tzatziki, lettuce, tomato... annoying.  The service isn't very good - the main guy is talkative and nice but all of his staff act like they're just working for the end of their shifts. It's depressing talking to them - to the staff at Feta & Olives - try smiling!!!  I only go to this place when I'm forced to eat in the food court and am feeling like gyro for lunch. In a pinch, it'll do but you're better off walking across the street to Jimmy the Greek and getting way better food for the same price (and more of it).  This is another one of those places that I have to keep asking myself WHY I go to on occasion."}
{"text":"Rubbery chicken (like Subway), so much sauce it's like soup at the bottom of your pita, and oddly oily. This was pretty gross to eat and extremely messy.   The pita bread itself was good and the vegetables were fresh. (And true to the name, the Feta & Olives were great). Maybe I'd try the salad or sides but the wrap was a disaster. No reason something that simple should be that poorly made. And using less, better quality chicken would be way better than using a lot of cheap chicken. Staff was nice."}
