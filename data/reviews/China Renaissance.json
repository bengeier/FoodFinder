{"text":"We have been eating here for years!  We absolutely LOVE the Sesame Beef!  You can order it mild or spicy!  Also, ask for the HOT OIL to add to it for even more great flavor a more of a kick.  The won ton soup is rather drab so we've stopped ordering it.  The fried rice and egg rolls are okay.  Good HOT mustard and sweet & sour sauces for the egg rolls!  I'm sorry that I cannot review more dishes but the Sesame Beef rocks and I have to order it every time I go (which is only about once a month or so).  I did try the General Tso's Chicken several years ago and it was good, but not great.  I would highly recommend ordering the Sesame Beef!  Also, we were just there yesterday and it seems that over the past couple of months there has been a change in ownership?  staff?  We don't recognize any of the people.  The fried rice and egg roll used to be better than it was yesterday.  The Sesame Beef was still awesome though!"}
{"text":"I cracked up at the sign that just says, \"China,\" but found the food to be really good.  I'm a fan of the three different chicken dishes I've had and I will continue to go back.  I agree with the other reviewer that their Sesame chicken is a must.  Admittedly, I've yet to dine in the restaurant.  All of my orders have been take away.  Though I've been happy each time."}
{"text":"The portions were small in the food was terrible the beef tasted like it was rubber in the broccoli was the tiniest I've ever seen one of the worst Chinese restaurants I've ever eaten at"}
{"text":"Have been struggling to find a local Chinese take-out with good food as of late. China Renaissance did not deliver unfortunately. I arrived and placed my order and the woman was very nice and professional. Dining room was empty, food cooked promptly after ordering pepper steak, chicken with broccoli, and a pint of fried rice. I was not a fan of the \"brown sauce\" tasted more like soy sauce and there was ALOT of it. The other issue was with the pepper steak, received a ridiculous amount of vegetables (the peppers being too mushy, not at all crispy) not much beef, and of course more ridiculous amounts of thin sauce. Fried rice and egg roll were good. The rest was bearable after dumping out a full 2 cup worth of sauce."}
{"text":"One of the very good restaurants I have been to. Love chinese and these fellas pack a punch with the competition...love the lo mein and soups...and the free chips they serve before the meal but with the soup is just amazing. Since I am from India and my mom made similar chips, just reminded of them...the restaurant is quiet coz of a lot of orders for takeout but the ambience is pretty nice too."}
{"text":"Tried eating there today and found its takeout only. They have a couple of tables for dine-in space, but the girl working the counter told me I wasn't able to dine in. I was looking forward to trying some of the food that had good reviews!"}
{"text":"Maybe it wasn't my luck?!.... 2 Times within a month.I noticed there were hair in my food, hm...  Not sure how I feel about that?.. The waitress was nice. But, damn, not sure if I'll come back anytime soon... Felt disappointed"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food at reasonable prices.  Have been going here for years, both for lunches from work, carryout, and dinner.  My favorites are the Empress Chicken, the Hot and Sour soup, and any of the Black Bean dishes.  Gary does an excellent job in the kitchen.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"They have relocated. New address is 29336 Lorain Rd. They are now delivery and carry out only. No more dine in."}
{"text":"I'm always game to trying all Chinese take-out places at least once. And once is all this place is going to get.   I never personally came to the restaurant, my S.O. brought food home from the restaurant.  I've never been so dissatisfied in Chinese food in my life.   My boyfriend got chicken and broccoli while I had pepper steak with peppers and onions. I know that sauce is important in Chinese cooking...but do you really need 2 cups of sauce for one order?  Seriously, I tipped the container over a cup and it filled more than once!  As for the peppersteak...all I got was maybe 8 pieces of meat alongside two whole peppers and a whole onion.  I like my veggies, don't get me wrong...but there was absolutely no balance what so ever when it came down to it.   I'm still trying to find the best Chinese food restaurant around my area...and this isn't it."}
{"text":"Delicious!   We've driven past this place 1,000 times and never noticed it.  We went after checking Yelp for ideas.     It was great!  Our group of three had the General Tso's chicken, sesame chicken, and Kung Pao chicken.  We were able to order each one with a \"spicy level\" between 1 and 5.  They were all great!  Our favorite was the sesame chicken.   It has a nice, clean dining area, and handled a lot of take out orders while we there."}
{"text":"Just like food court chinese food. Started with wonton soup and shrimp chips. The soup was ok...just broth and wontons but a little too salty. The shrimp chips basket had a few fresh ones lurking on top but the bottom ones were hard and stale. Draw your own conclussions from that! The egg rolls came out next. There was something definatly different from other egg rolls and being an egg roll enthusiast I was not impressed. Tasted very \"doughy\" and lacked taste from the filling. Maybe processed and not freshly made? The disappointment continued through the main courses...Yu Shan chicken and Mongolian beef. Very bland on both. The veggies were fresh and tasty however which saved the dishes from being total losers. Service was good and friendly though. I feel, without trying to sound too snobish, that the customers writing five star reviews need to broaden there horizons in terms of good chinese food. Like I stated before, there was nothing that stood out about our meal that differed from what you can buy from any mall food court chinese food. Nothing that would bring me back or recommend to others thats for sure!"}
{"text":"I have a job working out in the field so whatever my last property is, that's where I get food. This has been very interesting. The reviews were so good I thought this would be a slam dunk.  Crab Rangoon: only four for the price which is ok as long as they're good.  No sauce was given for these. Ok. Yeah eating them with no sauce was wildly disappointing. Really how hard is it to have a side of sweet and sour? Duck sauce is no sub.  Spicy pork combo.  The veggie egg roll was weird. Overwhelming taste of black pepper. This place has VERY small portions btw.  The pork was barely spicy despite the fact that I chose a \"3\" in spice level out of 5. The pork was so over cooked and chewy I skipped it. The fried rice was very good.  I wouldn't come back. It's too close to the mall where I can get something decent."}
{"text":"Keeping in mind this is a new restaurant. The menu is straight forward but the prices are a little on the high side ($10-$16) for your entree (rice of choice and meat/veg). Chose 2 dinners 1 egg roll and soup. Came to round $25 for the 2 of us.    The wonton soup was pretty flavorless and that was the theme of the meal. The Kung Pao lacked any \"pow\" (I realized they didn't ask how hot I wanted it when I started eating) and my wife's egg roll was undercooked. We both agreed that it was a pretty underwhelming meal.     I hope this place makes some changes because of how convenient it is for me. Between the bland food and lack of customer service both on the phone and in person it's gonna take some work."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in town, hands down. Everything is made right before you order and the quality is superb. They also serve certified angus beef! Portions are large and well presented. The sesame chicken or beef are our favorites!"}
{"text":"This is our go to chinese takeout place. The sesame chicken is like eating sweet little chicken candies and I love the moo shoo chicken. The fried rice can be a little under seasoned, but that's kind of how I feel about all fried rice. I've never eaten inside, but the people are always very nice when I pick up the food, so I'm sure the service would be good.  Fair warning, it will take the 20 minutes at least to be ready, so call ahead if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"China -- as the big sign states as you drive by on Lorain Road.  They have been around for years -- I was a fan years ago and decided to give it a try.  Excellent Chinese Food.  The Hot and Sour Soup is one of the very best in town -- so much flavor!  I got the Broccoli Vegetarian Dish and is was excellent.  My companion got the Mushu Chicken and it looked outstanding.  He said it tasted phenomenal.  Now the only complaint I have is that they didn't have brown rice.. I'm not a fan of white.  I will definitely go back.  It is very traditional and basic Chinese but you can't go wrong having a meal here!"}
{"text":"There is no other Chinese take out I've ever had that compares to the deliciousness of China Renaissance. I have tried several things; Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken, combo fried rice, empress chicken, general Tso's, beef and broccoli, sesame chicken and beef, and the list goes on. Nothing has disappointed me. Spicy dishes can be made on a spicy scale they called \"star\" 1-5. I always go 5 star, it's hot but not too hot to eat (buffalo wing hot) My 10 year old can handle 2 star spicy, not really hot at all.  Service is, quick, friendly and my food is always hot. On occasion they will give you a 20% off coupon for your next order, LOVE IT!   The portions are enough for two adults to split and feel full. You could probably feed 3 kids with 1 meal. Prices are a little steep, $13 for sesame beef but well worth every penny! Average dish is around $10, so be prepared, unless you've scored a coupon!   I will give china nothing less than 5 stars. If your getting Chinese take out- it's got to be CHINA RENAISSANCE! Ohhh so good!!!"}
{"text":"Gave China a second chance after a long break. Ten years ago used to eat here frequently. Went back a year ago and got a carry out order of scorched sesame chicken.  Yuck. Decided to give them one more chance.   Ordered sesame chicken, yu shan chicken, hot and sour soup and won ton soup. Nearly choked when I heard the total - no bargain if it was lousy food.    No worries after digging in.  The soups were very good.  The sesame chicken (the gold standard) was awesome once more and so was the yu shan.   I would definitely go back - but I would pad their estimated carryout time by 20 minutes - they were slow moving on the food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  This was a place I liked until tonight.  From a food perspective, not bad.  Pretty tasty and I would recommend.  My issue and the reason for the 1 star has everything to do with customer service related issues.  I ordered food tonight for my children and myself.  They offer delivery and pickup.  Delivery was running at about an hour, so I chose to pick the food up to get it quicker.  I had to tell the guy on the phone taking my order twice that I wanted fried rice with my meal.  When I went to pick up my order, I was asked what kind of rice I wanted because it was never written down.  The rice wasn't even in the bag with the food.  This should have been a sign.  I drive home and realize they forgot my food.  My young children already started eating and I call the restaurant.  The first thing they say when they pick up the phone is \"pickup or delivery\".  I explain the situation and request that they delivery my missing food.  I went round and round with the manager and learned a few things.  1) Delivery costs them $0.53 per mile and delivering my missing food would be too expensive for them.  2) They refuse to deliver missing food on a pickup order.  3) Even though they offer delivery as a standard business practice, they will not deliver to fix an error they committed.  I was informed that they were too busy to deal with my issue and even though they had deliveries going out to other people, they would under no circumstance bring me my missing food while their driver was out making other deliveries in the area.  They were kind enough to refund my money for only my missing portion of the order if I drove back up and picked up my missing food.  They gave me an even $10 and told me to keep the change along with my missing food.  Purely based on principle, I cannot and will not recommend this place of business to anyone.  This isn't how you treat customers when you commit an error.  If they didn't offer delivery as a standard option, I would have had no issue going back up to get the food they forgot to give me.  The fact they do offer delivery and refused to have the driver drop off my food while out delivering other orders is unacceptable.  I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Northeast Ohio by far!  Our family has been enjoying their fresh and delicious food for over 20 years. We've tried other places closer to us, but it was so worth the longer drive to have a meal prepared by Gary and his wife! Now they have moved a little closer to us,but only offer takeout and delivery (no more dining in) so we will definitely be doing that and enjoying their food at home more often!"}
{"text":"One of the greatest Chinese place I've been to! Looks like a hole in the wall like most places but as soon as you step foot inside its a BEAUTIFUL, clean place! Don't judge this place by its cover!!!"}
{"text":"It looks like something saved them.  My previous review was fair at the time, and warned people away.  You can come back now.  The food and wait staff we know and love has returned.  Chinese Renaissance is back in the premium restaurant category with Li Wah and Pearl of the Orient.  The food is creative and well prepared, with an attentive wait staff.   Gary and his wife took the place back from the kids and it makes all the difference in the world.  I can highly endorse China Renaissance after coming back for several evenings of outstanding dining."}
{"text":"Favorite basic Chinese restaurant in the US, so far. It always seems dead but I'm not sure if that's because I tend to go out to eat kind of late.   Everything here is delicious. They make the thinnest mu shoo pork wraps I've ever had. I've tried most things on the menu and haven't been disappointed by anything yet.  Now if I could just find a China replacement in every city that I move to..."}
{"text":"China Renaissance is the only place I will order from. I drive 25 minutes to get food here. They're sesame chicken is incredible. It's two meals for around $12. Not a bad deal if you ask me. We are also fond of their crab Rangoon (they're huge) and the wonton soup. They have a customer for life in me!"}
{"text":"The service was great.  We were warmly welcomed upon entrance, and quickly seated.  We were then given a complimentary basket of shrimp toast... I was the only shrimp eater in my party, so they were all MINE! I ordered chicken and string beans with white rice - very, very bland.... definitely could have used some jalapeños or red pepper flakes.... the others at the table LOVED their sesame chicken and general tso's.  I also ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer - another bad choice... visually I could see the coconut, but it didn't have any flavoring of coconut. I guess, if every in the area, I'll have to order better next time.  Note: the outside sign only says China.... China Renaissance is only on the door."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I like that they use certified angus beef. We ordered orange chicken, which was pretty basic. Vegetable Egg Foo Young, which was dry as they put the gravy on the side, I like that it had broccoli in it as you usually don't see. I also got the ginger spiced beef, the beef was good quality & it was loaded with veggies which I loved! Sauce was a little runny and not zest enough. Overall good food, good price. Will be going there again"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here... Used Grubhub to deliver. Took well over an hour to receive my order. That was ok, the driver was nice. The prices are high compared to other Chinese places I've eaten and I didn't care for my food at all. The egg rolls were not cooked all the way through. Several of the pieces of chicken in my meal were the tendon part and had to be spit out. And the pieces of chicken were very small. Plus, the sweet and sour sauce was not good at all. The rice was ok, a little bland. The chicken in the chicken fried rice was over cooked so it was dry and chewy. My fiancé got a chicken/steak/shrimp meal and he gave his a 7 outa 10. I will not order from here again.. Basically, $50 for 1 good meal."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with there customer service. I stopped in to place two orders the second one I asked to add shrimp to an entree and the girl was like I don't think we can do that she went around the corner and asked and came back and she was like we can't to that.  I was like I'm willing to pay extra and she just did not seem to care.  I work in customer service and know how important it is to try and see what you can do to make customers happy. It was not like I had some crazy request. I said never mind I'll go somewhere else and she just fave me this look like whatever.  We haven't even eaten here yet and will not be returning.  There are plenty of other places with better customer service in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm really new to North Olmsted, as I'm here for the summer so trying new restaurants is a given. I used UberEats yesterday as my boyfriend and I were too tired and too lazy to go out somewhere and eat or cook. We ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the fried rice. I am not lying to you when I say my boyfriend is THE pickiest eater ESPECIALLY with chinese. The chicken and the rice were absolutely delicious. We will be placing many orders here over the summer!!! Very Impressed :)"}
{"text":"Average at best. Not sure how a Chinese restaurant could screw up Chinese food, but these guys did. The Lo-Mein and Kung Pao seemed to have been cooked in the same sauce, both bland and lacking of any flavor and the Lo Mein was made with linguini noodles. Based on this experience, I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I honestly do not know why this place has gotten more than two stars review. When i walked in I was automatically assumed to be with the man who walked in directly in front of me and thusly must have been there to pick up an order... Nope. I wanted to sit down. So i sat there for ten minutes before they realized I was not with him and wanted to eat there. I finally got seated and every single thing I ordered tasted precooked, premade and reheated. I had trouble physically eating the egg roll.  It was like eating gum. If the main dish was any more greasy I could have fried some fries in its grease. I will never go back. I do expect good food and competent service when I eat somewhere"}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent service.  Open for business, just ate there today.  Not sure why it's listed as Closed."}
{"text":"This is some of the better Chinese food around the area and it is definitely the best take out you will find.  Seriously give it a try and see what I mean. I love the hot sour soup and enjoyed every dish I've tried."}
{"text":"Great Chinese restaurant on the Lorain Road wasteland in North Olmsted.  They've been in business for several years, and it has a (deservedly) very loyal following.  Their Sesame Chicken is the standard by which I judge all others, and I have yet to come across one that I like more.  The menu sticks pretty closely to American-style Chinese, but it is all well-prepared and reasonably priced.  Dine-in portions seem to be a bit larger than take-out.  Definitely try the Sesame Chicken (ask for it spicy if that's your thing), and the hot and sour soup is great too.   Note: The big red lit sign visible from the road just says \"China\""}
{"text":"Best Chinese food on the west side, maybe in all of Cleveland. They downsized the restaurant in size, but their food is absolutely delicious. Spicy if you ask for it."}
{"text":"LOCALS BEWARE! Worst chinese food I've ever had! Bland, cold, and disgusting. They use freaking fettuccine noodles for their lo mein and they douse it in soy sauce. So gross!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at China Renaissance since I was about 9 years old. My Nana loved coming here - she always ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce and a martini -- up with a lemon twist (this place can make a cocktail, and thanks to my Nana for teaching me how to drink like a lady at such an early age). I have extremely fond childhood memories of this place, especially when our entire big, loud Italian family would come here together at Nana's request. The staff, a wonderful family who we had come to know, was always welcoming and accommodating - even if we can be a bit of an overwhelming bunch. We celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, my confirmation, my acceptance into college and many other important times in our lives here - because that is how good this place is and how much it meant to my family.   Now, I've grown up, moved around and traveled the world. I can honestly say this is still the best Chinese food I've ever had - and I'm proud to say my palate has matured a bit from the time i was 9. I recently came here for dinner again with my mom, niece and nephew while visiting my home in North Olmsted for a weekend. It wasn't the same without my Nana (she passed away when I was 17) - I wish my niece and nephew could have had the experience of going there with her, and watching her fight to pay the bill with my mom (literally, these two ladies once ripped it in half after a tug of war battle, each insisting on paying). But one thing was constant - the quality of the food is still just as delicious as I remember it. It is truly unmatched - and this is coming from a traveler who has visited Chinatowns in many major cities in the world. North Olmsted is lucky to have a gem like this.   Please don't miss out on this treasured family-owned restaurant. In a city that has become overrun with sub-par chain food, it would be a shame to overlook the excellent food, atmosphere and service at China Renaissance. I love this place and always will!"}
{"text":"Do you ever hear so many people tell you that you absolutely HAVE to try a restaurant because it's allegedly the BEST option in town?   Kinda like when when your Aunt Suzy says you, \"Just have to meet my neighbor's daughter. I know she's 47 and still lives in her parent's basement, but you'll really hit it off because she likes 'The Netflix', too...\"  Well, China Renaissance is that place for me.   After being told that I just had to give it a shot, I finally did. Well, the first time I tried they cancelled my uber eats order after an HOUR with little explanation. Minus one star.   After I waited the customary 30 days for my anger to subside, I decided to give them a fresh start and ordered again.   Based off of reviews, we went with Mongolian Beef and General Tso/Tao/Tsao's Chicken. Fun Fact: General Tso was a real person, and his family doesn't like the fact that an Americanized chicken dish is named after him, but I digress...  I opted to add $3 \"extra beef\" to the Mongolian Beef order, because, well, I'm kind of a glutton.   What arrived was a very tasty beef dish that unfortunately was mostly vegetables and without any trace of the \"extra beef\". It was almost as if my cardiologist intercepted the order and told the chef, \"No, no, no... more veggies for Dan...\"   Tasty? Yes. Worth the $12 I paid for it? Not a chance. Minus one star.   The General Tso's chicken was decent, and they obviously use a higher quality of chicken than most places do.   There's just one major issue I have with that: I like my General Tso's to be the smaller chicken cuts of questionable origin that I've grown accustomed to. If I wanted huge pieces of chicken breasts in a barbecue-like sauce I'd just do it myself on a grill.   Now, I know that General Tso's Chicken is like the chili of the Chinese food world: It's different at every place. Nonetheless, minus one star.   Just like Aunt Suzy's recommendation, this was a letdown."}
