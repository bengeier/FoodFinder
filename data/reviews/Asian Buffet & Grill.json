And some of the best tasting food you can find on a buffet! 

You have to try this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was great its new and the food was great LOTS of sushi to chose from.
We will be going here from now on."}
{"text":"I have not eaten there and probably will not be...let me explain...got there, walked in, decor was nice...and that is about it...saw 6 attendants waiting for guests...so nothing to do...that explains the hovering and the Truman Show effect...I asked if I could walk around and take a look at their food offerings...as I browsed, it did not look good...crusty old fried rice, sauces that had film floating...in other words, the food was not fresh...I will admit, I did go between lunch and dinner time/ off peak, but thats still no excuse for the food not to be fresh...I saw maybe three people actually as customers...out of kindness or pressure they got stuck...the hostess kept talking to me trying to persuade me to stay, but I ran for the hills...

trying to understand the business...they spend tens or hundreds of thousands to renovate the place, spend thousands on rent and have inedible food...who would eat there...it spells failure...

what comes first, the chicken or the egg...you invest so much money and not get the food part right...ok, so there are few customers so you don't change up the freshness of the food...a sure suicide...yes, it costs money to keep things fresh, but thats why you went into business...now if you kept things fresh even though there are few customers, there's a chance more customers would try the place...and by experience and word of mouth customers would follow...

I want the place to succeed, but its up to management to change...

as to the people who tried the place and gave it over 4...you need to get out of the house more..."}
{"text":"First time eating at Asian Buffet & Grill and the  food was fantastic!   Everything I ate was fresh and the variety was great. There was plenty of food to choose from and I enjoyed the being in a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This has to be the best buffet in town! Unlimited lunch for only $8.99! That is including sushi, hibachi grill, and even a noodle bar!!! I am in love!"}
{"text":"They have changed some new stuff put in the buffet bar..awesome food and good to try..."}
{"text":"They just opened one week ago. It's right next the Beauty School.

They have plenty of seats. Really good for party.
Lots of 8 seats table. Super clean. 

There is a noodle bar, which you can choose your own noodles and soup favors.
Sushi bar, hibachi fried, lots of seafood, fresh salad, ice cream. 

Nice price and open late. 

I'm definitely recommend it to everyone and gonna bring more friends here."}
{"text":"I was super surprised to find the to-go buffet was charged by the pound. Wtf who does that??? I have done this quite a few times at Chinese buffets and they just give you one box to fill until your heart's desire. And their pricing wasn't too generous either .
Lunch: $4.99/lb.
Dinner: $5.99/lb.
Sushi/Seafood: $8.99/lb.
Trust me, their seafood is not worth the $8.99/lb price tag. My box of assorted sushi (I went for just the sushi) came out to be 1.9 lbs. I was very disappointed that I would have to pay $20 for some buffet grade sushi. I gently expressed that I had never seen the \"by-the-pound\" concept at Chinese buffets and he said \"how else will we charge ppl for unlimited food?\".... Ummm by the Box!!! 
Luckily, the cashier said he would give $2 discount and then charged me even lower price. Which made this trip worthwhile ... But I doubt I will ever do a carry-out again. I mean, had I gone for just Dine-in I would have easily eaten/wasted four times the amount I brought home with me.

All said and done...
The food is pretty good for a Asian buffet in Charlotte. Good selection for a weekday.
Went on Thursday afternoon. Lunch buffet was $5.99."}
{"text":"The food had good flavor but was way over cooked. It takes 5 mins to chew the honey chicken. They need to invest in a meat thermometer."}
{"text":"Made quite the drive to check out this buffet! The location is a little sketch and could use some more lights. The inside is huge and very spacious for large parties. The staff was also pretty sweet too and want to make sure the customers are happy. 

But the food, the food is really salty!! They offer a lot of seafood, from crab to crawfish. The clams were awful, it was very fishy and not cleaned well. They even had steak (what?) which actually wasn't too bad. The sushi is interesting, a lot of sauce though. I tried one of the soups and got Curry Noodle and it was extremely water, but definitely could be improved! Overall just super salty and I don't want to drive that far for salty food!"}
{"text":"I gave this place four stars for some specific reasons. 1. The price. It was defenitely worth the price. 2. It's new and clean. 3. The waitresses worked hard. And 4. The food was satisfactory to good. I'm not a big buffet fan. Some of the staff; particularly one women was walking around talking on a phone while wiping down the food area? The sushi was OK. Most of the other food was ok. I would recommend it for an empty tummy and a thin wallet. It does get my \"best buffet\" award in charlotte!"}
{"text":"New Sushi Buffet in town.  Just tried it last night, nice environment, staff, and of course food for the best value, sushi, Chinese, hibachi, soup noodles, you name it!"}
{"text":"Food is not fresh. Pho noodle is ok. Sushi not good. We paid 30 plus tips. Overall not coming back."}
{"text":"I wanted to go try it out tonight and when me and my family went they were closed ? I called around 4 to check prices and they were still open? I wonder what happen...  does anybody know why ? They didn't want to talk to me when I tried asking. Maybe they were force to close?"}
{"text":"I was leery of another Asian buffet as Hibachi Grill is right up the road and I don't like it at all. I was very pleasantly surprised by Tropicana buffet it is new so it's very clean. They have everything from a salad bar with traditional Chinese buffet items, fresh made sushi, a soup station, making your favorite Vietnamese soup and a Hibachi station, which is what I ate, I got to pick all my favorites and have it grilled right in front on me. I would definitely say as with any buffet go at lunch or dinner busier times so the food will always be fresh and I'm pretty sure you can find whatever you want to feast on. Also don't let the outside fool you, it is very nice inside!"}
{"text":"This buffet was actually a pleasant surprise! Taking the place of a dilapidated seafood restaurant on busy Independence, they've spruced up the place a lot. Inside, there's a large water feature upon entering and a pagoda in the center that houses a wide selection of sushi (for a buffet), build your own hibachi and made-to-order pho and soup station. Outside, the signage is strange (sounds and looks like they picked the name of the place from a random sign they found) and it looks like it could double as a gentleman's club (I.e. no windows). 

Back to the food - there are multiple hot tables with a variety of mostly Asian dishes, though also plenty of American options including french fries and fried corn and some other options like fried plantains. There are also serval cold tables including salad, fresh fruit and pre-made desserts. Big plus, there's also a soft-serve machine! Sadly, there are no toppings to be had. :-(

When you walk in, you're greeted immediately and the service has been generally very friendly, with quick removal of used plates. The real value is it's only $8.99 for lunch, and they offer to-go by the lb. if you're in a rush. Though it costs more if you get seafood or sushi. I'll continue to visit weekly as the sushi is good for the price and the location is convenient!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing especially for the price I'm eating the food right now as we speak phone in one hand. fork in the other. I'm am tearing this food all the way up! I definitely feeling like Chinese food when I woke up this morning and this place got the job done the right way. I suggest every come to this place and eat till u explode!!...... they even have mozzarella sticks !!! If you dont believe me just look at the way I'm staring at this mozzarella stick of gold. #snuggland"}
{"text":"this place was not that grate , I ate there with my mom about a hour ago . she found the food cold , I found it over cooked and greasy . The only things I really like where the Sensei balls , the veggie roll witch was greasy but had a good flavor and watermelon was good other then that the food was not spatular . Also the waitress was not friendly , my mom tipped her well she didn't even say thank you ."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new buffet. Had a coupon for this place. Pleasantly impressed. This place is huge. Very large selection of food, hibachi grill, tons of fresh sushi. Fast service. Friendly staff. Don't think I've ever been this impressed with a buffet."}
{"text":"Now I've tried every Buffet on independence Blvd. and rhis one has them all beat. It not nearly what Buffet Dynasty was or Tin Tin was great.  But for the same money as the others this one I so much better. Biggest selection of sushi. More steam tables. Much nicer interior. It's was really 3star food at best but compared to all the others 4"}
{"text":"I have been wondering about this place for a little while and I was nearby and very hungry, so I stopped in.
It's a very large buffet and in the center they have a Noodle Station as well as a Hibachi grill and sushi.
It will take several visits to sample all they have available, so I focused on my favorites. Pepper steak, spicy squid, Mei fun, stir fried pepper shrimp. I found some Kimchi on the salad bar and noticed that they had lychee as well as chocolate pudding.
I need to bring my wife and son back as they prefer more traditional offerings versus Americanized Asian food."}
{"text":"The other reviewers are spot on. First, I've been to the other matthews buffet, not even a mile from this one, multiple times, so, if I happen to say \"in comparison\" - that's what I'm comparing it to.
My thoughts:
This buffet is beautifully designed, and there are few customers compared to the other local option. We were greeted warmly and allowed to check out the buffet before deciding. Right away I could tell this had as many, or more, options as their competitor, and the sushi looked (and tasted) much more authentic and fresh. They also had custom soup bar which I and my boys enjoyed (exceptions below). Some of the foods were greasy, as said in other reviews, but these are the foods you'd expect to be a little greasy at a buffet. Otherwise, the food was probably 3.5 stars/5. 
Negatives: I could not find their prices online, and the other reviewer mentioned a cheaper lunch option. That's true but ONLY on weekdays. Weekend lunches are dinner price (12.99). 
Also, they only had soft serve. Their competitor has 6-8 flavors of normal ice cream.
The soup bar was great, but the chefs did not speak English, so it was impossible to get the order right. He asked if I wanted spicy or not, I said \"a little\" and he looked as if I'd given him a complicated calculus problem. Neither of my boys wanted meat in their soup, but they got it anyway. ? That's after he said \"no meat\" -repeating my order, multiple times. 
Lastly, the other reviewers are right, the wait staff HOVERS over you. They were pleasant, but twice we had to tell them we weren't finished with our plate! Secondly, there was actually TOO many staff. (Maybe if they had less they could lower the price?) Lastly, my boys and I got up to get dessert, when we came back they'd CLEARED our table . Yes, I'd already paid, but that was pretty hasty and inconsiderate. She nicely apologized and asked if we wanted our waters back, I declined. I was ready to head out.
Lastly, for the three of us, it cost $9 more than the competitor. So, I guess I'll stick with the other option. (And NO, I don't work for them.)"}
{"text":"My cousin recently got food poisoning from a buffet so I was iffy going to a buffet. However this buffet is really clean and cheap! We went for our Christmas dine-in and I just fell in love with the options the buffet offered. There was a sushi bar, noodle bar, and pho soup. I got 5 dishes in total and was sooo full. The first plate I got was assorted sushi with salmon and spicy rolls, the second plate I got pho, third plate spicy noodles, fourth plate I got chicken, fifth plate: dessert. However I left room for dessert because I love the lychees. During lunch time adult pricing is $9. It was nice because there was a lot of room and we got a long table. The service was amazing and I would recommend this place. It is really good for big families! I never felt so full but in a good way :)"}
{"text":"Great variety, food is really delicious. Been here twice. But they must use MSG because I get *really* bad headaches after (& that happens to me when I have MSG). Prices are fantastic for what you get!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped for lunch. Staff is friendly. Great selection of food. Sushi selection also great."}
{"text":"The sushi here was so fresh. All the food had a good quality about it. I can't wait wait to go back for the buffet!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner today. The 
Chicken and broccoli was cold and the texture of the chicken was just like rubber. The sushi looks like it's been sitting there for ages. The list goes on and on. I can't believe I payed 14 dollars without a beverage and disappointed dish after dish. I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"This buffet is huge! My favorite dish is the beef noodle soup, and it's probably one of their signature soup. They also have few other soup choices, and they also have sushi and hibachi! The price is fair for the value I'm receive, and I will come back and try once every week. Good have to new restaurant open up in east independence, so we will have more to choose from."}
{"text":"Who in their right mind would spend such a large amount of money, they must have spent, to open for business and serve food so wrong. LOL

The Shrimp wasn't cleaned at all. Why wouldn't they de-vein the Shrimp? LOL

The Vietnamese Noodle Soup, or best known as Pho, had the toughest slithers of beef I've ever had. Not to forget, not having Basil available.

The Sushi. Don't get me started on the Sushi. LOL

I eat Asian cuisine all the time. This place is far from tasting Asian."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite in Charlotte and one of the best restaurants in the city (it's actually in Matthews).  It has everything you could possibly want when it comes to East Asian cuisine - traditional Chinese, sushi, stir-fry/Mongolian barbecue or grill, and made-to-order soup. The manager (Tom) is accessible and accommodating.  The tofu with broccoli or mixed vegetables is fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Very good place and cheaper than China Buffet. I think the selection of food items is more as well. On the weekends ( sat and sun) they have dim sum all day as well. Definitely be going here again 

$8.99 for lunch 
$12.99 for dinner after 4pm"}
{"text":"Exterior: This location used to be a seafood restaurant. The lot is large but from the outside, it looks a bit dingy. They tried to upgrade it by adding on a nice wooden door and some stone work. 

Interior: Absolutely stunning once you step through the doors. There is a tiny waterfall pond fountain right by the door. The walls are gorgeous and so is the starry color changing ceiling near the front counter. The hibachi / sushi / noodles bar is in the center of the buffet area. It separates the dessert from the main courses. Very spacious for gatherings or large groups. 
For the interior alone, I would give it 5 stars. It would have to be the best looking buffet offered in Charlotte (Yes, I'm even comparing it to Tin's) 

Food: Well, I would say the best they have to offer is the hibachi / sushi / noodles bar. My husband is very particular with his beloved pho. He tried the Vietnamese noodle and the broth was surprisingly good. They also offered wonton noodle soup, duck soup and some others. Sushi was fresh and there were a variety. 

Besides that area, the rest of the food options are pretty basic. Nothing too special and it's the typical buffet options. 

Pricing: It's the most wallet friendly in comparison to the surrounding Asian buffet off Independence Blvd. (in case you're unaware, there are a total of three Asian buffets including this location) 

Would I return? Sure. I don't mind it. It's pretty restaurant to look at and grubbing on noodles and sushi would probably be the best thing. Staff are very friendly and don't feel pushy unlike the other buffets in the areas. Would I recommend this location? Yeah. Just as long you're not driving far away. If you're in the area, stop by and try it."}
{"text":"Having lunch at The New Tropicana Buffet in Matthews NC - Can't stop eating those fried Oysters! Delicious and Freshly made."}
{"text":"We returned for Christmas Eve and it was very good. As I suspected from my first visit, the food was much better when the restaurant was busy and the food was turning over quickly."}
{"text":"Just had one of the worst experiences at this place. The food is OK but the service is terrible. I normally tip in cash so the servers can have immediate access to the funds. After we finished eating, I gave my credit card to the waitress. As I signed the receipt the waitress started complaining about something. After a while I realized that she is assuming that we are not tipping her since I did not add the tip on the receipt and she was insisting that I must put down a tip in the receipt. We were still sitting at the table and not leaving. As per our usual practice we tipped in cash and while walking out told the front office about the incident. There were two persons at the counter and neither of them showed any concern but instead told me \"most people tip the severs\". There are some things that I feel are completely wrong about this:
1. Since we belong to a minority the server and the restaurant manager profiled us as people who do not tip.
2. This is a buffet restaurant where we get our own food yet the servers are expecting the same percentage of tip as a full service restaurant.
3. The restaurant is paying so low to the servers that they are desperate and start blindly demanding for tip as soon as the bill is paid and not waiting for the customer to finish.
4. Is the tip a form of gratuity or ransom?"}
{"text":"The old seafood restaurant has been undergoing some remodeling for a while now, and has finally reopened as a Chinese/Hibachi/Sushi buffet, with some extensive work on the interior. The center is something of a showpiece, with fairly fresh sushi (for a Chinese buffet, at any rate), and they are happy to roll something you request, at least so long as you keep it reasonable, and they are not busy. They also have a hibachi grill and a noodle bar too.

On one side they have fairly standard Chinese buffet lines and the other salad and dessert items. Surrounding this setup are a huge number of tables - in fact, the place is cavernous on the inside. Even with the parking lot holding a number of cars, it seemed like they were empty, so it remains to be seen if they will last long!

Service was good, but because of the number of empty seats, there were plenty of servers standing around with nothing to do, and that could have contributed. Food was also fresh, but is something to watch in the future. Perhaps worth a visit, if even for the sushi - lunch is a good deal cheaper than dinner, and can be a deal for that alone."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunday afternoon. I was scared they were gonna be slammed but they really weren't that busy! They have a huge selection of food. They had a salad station which I did not touch lol. I first went to the noodle bar. I got my soup with udon noodles and was surprised at how much they gave me. It was good but I would definitely ask for half of that portion next time. They had an assortment of asian food and a hibachi station. I didn't get a chance to get hibachi because I was too full. I tried their assortment of asian food and it was all good. Average, but not great. Typical asian buffet. Worth the money because they are generally cheaper that most buffets."}
{"text":"I gave it two stars because the place was very clean and I enjoyed the noodle bar. The rest of the food was not good. It was way too greasy. I love crawfish but I could not eat it here because it was covered in grease and didn't look or smell cooked. (It still smelled like the ocean and was very dark) They also should retrain some servers. They were standing around staring at us hard and seem to be rushing us out when nobody was really even there. They brought the check out so fast. I would not come back unless this place was just a noodle bar. On a side note I thought it was weird there was a wedding going on while we were eating."}
{"text":"Asian Buffet and Grill I wanted to like you, I wanted you to be the best buffet the Charlotte area had to offer but there were some things that hurt this possibility. 

Now my parents have some weird obsession with Chinese buffers. I'm not sure if it's the love of Americanized Chinese food or the ability to eat whatever you want and as much as you want. Me however I'm not a fan of Chinese buffets. I really got my hopes up when I saw all the different options Asian Buffet and Grill had to offer. There is sushi, hibachi, a soup station and several different hot and cold food buffet options. I was most excited for the soup station. Not to many Chinese buffets have these stations and they are my favorite. The station had 6 different soups you could choose from and 4 different noodle options. I chose the curry with the rice vermicelli.  The broth was not very flavorful at all. It had a very faint curry taste. My nephew got the Vietnamese pho soup. This broth seemed to have a little more flavor but was still very bland. 

My hibachi dinner was good. I appreciated all of the options they had for this station and the speed of the cook. He was on it! My other hot food was good from the buffet. I also liked how they had a very varied set of dishes for you to choose from. And there wasn't pizza and Mac-a-roni like some other buffets. Someone explain how those got in the mix? 

When we arrived the place was very empty but as we finished they were running a wait. They staff was kinda half busing the tables in the beginning of our meal and towards the end they were more on top of it because of their wait. 

All in all I think this Chinese buffet is a better option in the charlotte area. I just need them to give those broths some more flavor!

{"text":"The food and service are continuously excellent. The sushi is good and plentiful. My husband loves the chicken with garlic sauce. Crab rangoons could use more crab. The restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Will def return. Can't comment on Chinese dishes as I really only ate sushi and shrimp but I was pleased with both."}
{"text":"Great place very upscale remodeled!  Food is great lunch buffet m-f just 5.99. 9.99 all weekend. Lost of selections great sushi noodle soup bar!"}
{"text":"For $8.99 lunch, u get more than you paid for.  The selections are there, but some of the items u can clearly see that have been sitting for a while.  Not an ideal appearance for a buffet setting.

Sushi doesnt seem to have a lot of rice like other places, they are decent.

Service is attentive.

Will come back."}
{"text":"I just got out of this restaurant after witnessing this sushi guy (mid-age Asian dude) serving sushi items after picking up pieces of salmon on the ground after he dropped them. He looked around to see if anyone saw him dropping those salmon. I guess he didnt see me. Do not eat their sushi or any of their food. I will never come back. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Love this place! Never crowded, clean, plentiful choices. Price is right, and the food is hot and fresh. Friendly service. Yessiree, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the ambiance was great, the staff was super friendly. The food, not so good. It was a little too greasy for my taste, as well as some of the other patrons based off off their facial expressions when they bit into something. 

I still believe this place can turn it around though. With a little tweaking this could be a powerhouse."}
{"text":"Was looking for a closer Chinese/sushi buffet near Matthews and tried the Tropicana.  Food was stale and not good, especially the sushi.  Pretty disappointed with this place and will not be back.  Its like a poor man's China Buffet.  Actually those suck too except the one at the end of Hwy 74 right before you get to uptown Charlotte.  That one is pretty great actually."}
{"text":"Second time here, first was a week ago for lunch, tonight was for dinner (8:30pm Friday night).  The buffet selection was okay.  Some items were very good, some weren't.  Mushroom chicken was very good, the orange beef was overly candied and hard to find the beef.  The honey chicken was good, the coconut shrimp was too candied and sticky.  The star of the buffet was the noodle soup bar.  Basically you choose what style broth/soup you want and what style noodle and they make it fresh in like 30 seconds piping hot.  I had the curry soup with udon noodles.  Wow....amazing.  I will come back here just for the soup....but during lunch...not dinner.  Dinner was $16.xx for one person and a soda after tax.  Lunch comes in around $10 I believe.  Anyhow, back to the soup, they probably should have opened a noodle bar instead and saved on rent.

This place had the potential to be really good if they can get rid of the overly greasy or candied dishes, it seems a number of the dishes they make don't hold up well on the buffet line with constant heat just sitting there.

On a side note the table staff seem to hover and spy on you like they're overtly waiting for you to finish so they can flip the table.  I know buffet waitstaff sometimes try and over-do the drink refills and dirty plate removal so they can make a case for a tip but.....its a very fine line.

Give em a shot while everything is nice and new."}
{"text":"Your typical Asian buffet.  Food is ok and variety is ok.  We like to go for a late lunches.  Once you get past the outside inside the place was remodeled from top to bottom and looks very nice and clean.  The buffet is always clean and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I came here the first time when it just opened!! The dishes very pretty good and flavorful . I stick to mostly vegetables and seafood dishes . I was not disappointed. Came here for dinner couple  more times and unfortunately the food changed . No longer flavorful. Everything greasy and overcooked .. everything tasted the same .. tried couple of pieces and general Ts chicken and it was so overcooked I couldn't swallow it . Too bad, I really had hopes for this place .. their service is pretty good and we sit in booth so I never notice them hovering over us ."}
{"text":"The place looks amazing The Beef soup was good but for the rest of stuff on the bar was crap I couldn't  eat any of it so I gave tropicana grill 1 star due to the nice Decour of the restaurant  I thing there closed now"}
{"text":"Ok this is a Buffett , pretty tasty we all enjoyed it. Out of the buffets in charlotte one of the best. People complain and I'm like really what are you an iron chef? It's a buffet pretty fresh and hot when I went. If you think your Guy From diners drive in and dives get a life. The place is good. You can't really judge a Buffett , really,"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch for the first time since they opened. Was very pleased with the selection for the price. I enjoyed the sushi bar. It seemed to have more choices than other Chinese buffets I have been to. The rest of the food was hot and fresh even though it was late into lunch. Will definitely be back. 
They also have a to go menu and u can order lunch ( quickly, I believe) or dinner to go"}
