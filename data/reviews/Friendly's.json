{"text":"Waitress was adorable and service good, but Sunday brunch took an hour to be served!  Perhaps they were short-staffed in the kitchen, but you would at least expect a manager to be out to apologize.  Everyone in the place looked unhappy and....hungry.  When the food did arrive it was decent breakfast food, but after so long of a wait, I'm not sure it really mattered.  Perhaps it was an isolated incident, but the lack of any managerial contact suggests a lack of professional management, or maybe they were so short staffed that the manager was busy cooking!"}
{"text":"Chicken noodle soup looked like it had been sitting around for a while. The service was terrible. The restaurant wasn't busy, but the waitress never refilled my drink, and no one came by to ask how everything was. Then the waitress sat down in a booth and started talking with the only other customer in the building while I waited for my bill. Don't waste your time and money eating here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here over the summer and have not gone back.  We had an absolute disaster and I even complained to the company who sent me a rinky-dink $5 gift card for my trouble.  Excuse me?  $5 whole whopping dollars to come back for more crap fest?  You must be joking.  

This used to be a really good location, but I don't know what happened to it.  First of all, our order was way wrong, then we had our food practically thrown at us when it was finally corrected, and we had to find another server to take our bill as ours wandered off elsewhere.  Our server was less than Friendly, and the most annoying thing was that we were only 2 out of 6 people in the whole place!  

If they had been busy, I could have forgiven a few of the glitches, but this was ridiculous!  Now, I am have a gift card that I will never use and do not wish to inflict on anyone else!"}
{"text":"Service matches its name. Had a flavorful and fresh pesto shrimp salad tonight. FriendZ soft-serve dessert 
topped the meal off nicely."}
{"text":"Solid place for a meal not expensive not fast food and not calorie laden"}
{"text":"Food as always is good, service is another issue. Waited 10 minutes before anyone even greeted us and it was a slow time of day.  Once we were finally greeted, we waited another 5 minutes to finally sit down. Our waiter took our order but forgot what we wanted by the time he reached the kitchen. Our food (ice cream and mozzarella sticks) shows up and he forgot our drinks (water and 2 Sprites). Once reminded, it took 10 more minutes to get our drinks and we were basically done with our food."}
{"text":"We walked out. Didn't even get a glass of water. Place smelled like vomit when we walked in. Took 10 minutes to get seated, no one even came over and waited another 15. Sad thing is, the place wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Can't beat their Reeses Pieces Sunday. It is about $6 for amazing peanut butter sauce goodness. It is huge! 

They have an outside service area for ice cream. They seem to have remodeled in the past 5 or 6 years so it is pretty clean and new looking. You may still dine in for ice cream or lunch/dinner. 

It is right off the I-71 and near the fairgrounds, Southwest Hospital, and B-W. 

We used to come here for dinner sometimes at B-W."}
{"text":"Its as good as I thought it would. All of the other restaurants (which is Friendly's) are great. This one is different. The hamburger buns are a little burnt, but still the food is great! Even the service is great! Sometimes they can burn the food sometimes, but its still good. If you are looking for a place that is close to u and close to u on the road, then this is the place!"}
{"text":"The food was halfway decent but this is one of the dirtiest looking restaurants I have ever been to. It looks like they have not swept or mopped the floor in a month. Our waitress was nice and we had no issues with service. The building is just gross inside."}
{"text":"Service was good and the food was just fine.  I had the ultimate grilled cheese with a side of the tomato soup.   Friendly's makes the best grilled cheese.  They don't skimp on the cheese at all, and it comes out just right.  The soup was very tasty.  It could have been a little hotter however.   For dessert I had a small sundae with peanut butter sauce, Reese's Pieces, and vanilla ice cream.   They could have added more of the reese's considering I had to pay extra for it.   

Overall a worthwhile meal and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"From my son who is in 3rd grade:  This is my FAVOURITE restaurant.  The food is REALLY good.  My favourite thing to order for breakfast are the pancakes.  For lunch and dinner I like to order the hotdog.  The waitstaff is really nice.  It is the BEST restaurant in the WORLD!"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't write a review for a place like Friendly's - it's a great place to bring the kids, has decent food, and the ice cream sundaes are worth a stop alone.  However, this Friendly's was absolutely filthy when we came in.

Now had we been in during a peak dining time (or perhaps immediately after) I would've understood a less-than clean restaurant, but we came in around 3pm and there was only 1 other table occupied.  It looked as if an entire kindergarten class had a field day in there with no adult supervision.  There were french fries and gummi bears strewn across the floor, dirty napkins and plates still on tables (they were still there when we left), crumbled crayons everywhere...it was a mess.  To top it off, not a single staff member was actively cleaning the entire time we were there and I saw at least 5 people working at the time.  Makes me wonder what kind of state the kitchen is in...

You may want to just stick with the ice cream at this location!"}
{"text":"We stop here for a quick bite before or after a movie and always leave room for ice cream.
 One reason to love Cleveland winters its cold enough to keep a half gallon of the new flavor you just had in the trunk. 
My wife enjoys the healthier food selections, I always try some thing new. the food is true American nothing special here but always satisfying and at the right price."}
{"text":"Great stop for a quick burger before a movie. Service was very good, we'll stop more often and save on the popcorn, well maybe just get a small one."}
{"text":"I rate things in a different sort of way when it comes to chocolate milkshakes. 

It is a 1 through 10 ranking. The best milkshake I ever had was an 8.9, extremely average milkshakes are a 7.0, and really bad chocolate milkshakes are 6.9 and lower.

Tonight I had a very mediocre 7.0 at this Friendly's. It was ALMOST a 6.9, so they just barely made it.

I got no satisfaction out of this chocolate milkshake at all. I would have gotten greater enjoyment from a simple glass of chocolate milk.

I regretted every slurp after the first few. As I got the initial taste, I kept hoping it would get better. I hoped and hoped as I sucked more up the straw. Damn...

It was just simply very disappointing. 

I want a chocolate milkshake that I get high off of. I want all kinds of pleasure sensors going off in my brain. That's what I'm looking for. And this $4.99 shake was nowhere near that. Nowhere near it! 

I mean, at 7.0, I'm being generous.

If your specialty is serving ice cream, then you ought to know what you're doing when it comes to chocolate milkshakes.

Very disappointing.

Can I say something positive? 

Yes, our young server did fine. Except no remedy was offered when she learned that I was not satisfied with their milkshake product.

Will I come back and spend $4.99 on another Friendly's chocolate milkshake at any other Friendly's location?

Hell no."}
{"text":"Pancakes very good. Crisp bacon was crisp. Coffee very good and served hot. Pleasant service. I was pleased."}
{"text":"my wife and I went for breakfast. had the omelet (bland) and the lumberjack. French Toast, eggs and home fries were good. the average age of the guests made us feel like we were at the senior center. service was \"Friendly\" :)"}
{"text":"(3.5) ~ good overall food & service.  The ice cream Sundaes are the star of the show:)lol"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I've been coming to this Friendly's for 30+ years and while I love nostalgia it shouldn't come in the form of dilapidated benches and worn out everything. Restaurant was muggy and everything was sticky and disgusting. We tried the food again and were disappointed that they hadn't made a dramatic shift from the reputation and changed everything on it to something edible. And $50 for this junk. 

The 2 stars are for our good service and still good ice cream. Take a page from Starbucks or McDonalds and UPGRADE.  You'll earn it back when the community talks about the new and improved Friendly's."}
{"text":"After being greeted upon arrival with \"I'll be right with you\" then having multiple employees walk past us we were finally seated after waiting several minutes. The place wasn't busy at all.

The restroom was filthy and smelled awful. Toilet paper all over. The toilet and urinal were both disgusting. The floor was terribly sticky. It was clear that nobody had cleaned this restroom in days. Ah waitress, could you point me in the direction of the vomitorium? 

The food was decent and the waitress was friendly. lol. See what I did there? A friendly waitress at Friendlys. Ha!  But no, really she was. She's the reason for the second star."}
{"text":"Great kids menu for decent price.  Reminds me of when my grandparents used to take me.  Not a lot has changed, was pleasantly surprised that they had a build your on veggie burger."}
{"text":"Always excited to home to visit and completely let down this past time. Service is lacking, food..ok"}
{"text":"Went here at 7pm about 8 tables empty. Someone came out and told that the manager said it would take about an hour to serve us. They had no cook or dishwasher OMG. So we left. Not sure when we'll ever go back."}
{"text":"I really like this Friendly's. I like getting kid's meals here. Got a Level 2 and it was...very good. Good service. With dessert too. So amazing. Affordable.  Can't wait to come back~"}
{"text":"All Friendlys locations in the Cleveland area have been closed. I hope this saves any unnecessary trips. Thanks for the memories!

The location in WESTLAKE Ohio did need some serious updating. I guess that's not happening!"}
{"text":"Friendly's is truly an 'old school' American institution!  My hometown in Northern New Jersey had one since the beginning of time, and we loved going there once in a while, especially for their ice cream sundaes, etc.  Ditto while living here in NE Ohio.  Now my 3rd grader enjoys coming here, and we see lots of families that bring their kids here as well.  Truth be told, the food was really good too!  I had their tuna melt on sourdough bread, with a side of fries.  My daughter had the mini burger sliders.  They were both prepared in normal time, and were really tasty and not greasy.  The fries were perfect too.  The ice cream sundaes were  'scrumpdillyicious'!  Our attractive server was kind and professional too, and made the experience a most pleasant one.  The manager even walked by to see if everything was to our liking.  Prices were also very good.  We will be returning here real soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly's is a throwback to my youth, the place to sit in a booth without the flies buzzing around and have a sundae in a real glass with a regular spoon.  We were on our way back home from a trip to Philly and just wanted a little dessert.  I'm not a fan of DQ and Rita's, these places are off my radar because of the prices for what they provide.  At Friendly's we each had a sundae and a cup of decaf.  The waiter took a little longer, but I realized he made us a fresh pot of coffee.  I'm particular about my coffee and this place makes a great cup.  The sundaes hit the spot as well.  Yes, this place is a little worn around the edges, but it was a nice way to cap off a great day."}
{"text":"How is this place still open.took forever to be noticed even though there were only one other couple eating.ordered cheeseburger sliders so dry damn near chocked.kids Mac and cheese burnt.granddaughters burger so greasy it was not editable.waitress seemed to not understand we couldn't eat the food kept trying to get us to take it home.place dark and depressing.first and last visit"}
{"text":"Friendly's has a quality food and reasonable prices. We have not been to Friendly's in years as they have fewer locations. I use to love the build your own burger which is no longer on the menu. I had the pepper jack burger which was much smaller than I remember however it was cooked well. We all had ice cream for dessert, the forbidden chocolate brownie was good."}
{"text":"Ohmygosh, this place is awful. My best friend has been dragging me here on a bi-weekly basis since we were in middle school, and I have to say, I have never had a meal I thoroughly enjoyed.

First off, this place is dirty. It just doesn't seem clean, you can even see back into the kitchen; and it even looks unsanitary. Ugh.
Secondly, the staff is ghetto. Seriously, they are so rude and would all rather be out back smoking than helping their customers. That alone would make me quit coming. ACTUALLY, it's so bad that when I was in high school there was a man that worked there that went so far as to find me on [then popular] Myspace and request to be my friend. Uh, weird, and stalkerish. 

And finally, the food. It's greasy, it's awful. The only time I have had an awful heartburn attack was after eating a BBQ melt from there. Worst night of my life. I have tried different menu items and they are all the same, greasy, clearly microwaved, and just downright awful. and for all of this I would still accept this place if it was dirt cheap, but it's NOT! It's SO expensive! It's INSANE! I'd rather go get McDonald's [which would actually taste better] than come here.

There is ONE good thing about this place, and that is the ice cream. They have some pretty darn tasty flavors, and on occasion you can get a good, thick milkshake [however most of the time it's more like milk than milkshake]. So one star for you based on this!

Skip it; head to somewhere local, I'd say."}
{"text":"Had to knock it down two stars. But like before our waitress was really nice and friendly.

But the restaurant was just so dirty and just, sad. Two of the three main lights were out when we went for dinner with the kids. Place was straight up dark.
The ice cream is no longer on display because I suppose the fridge is broken? 
You just feel like anything you touch in there is either filthy or going to fall apart in the next week. Don't think we'll ever return."}
{"text":"I was dragged to one of these. 

We all decided to stop someplace so this is where we went. 
Laughing at the menu was my entertain-a-ment. 
I tried to get a skim milk but all they had was two percent."}
