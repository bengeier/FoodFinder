{"text":"Closed. Is now a Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"This is one of THE BEST places to sit down, relax and enjoy the great food and nice wine selection.  You have to have the Bruschetta! I also recommend the Lobster Ravioli.  Anyway, nice people and the service is far better than most. I like that it is small and quaint.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Found this place near our house. Looking for some great apps and a glass of wine and we found it. We were pleasantly surprised when the owner came over and acknowledged it was our first time in and introduced us to his son/manager. The cheese plate and brushetta are awesome."}
