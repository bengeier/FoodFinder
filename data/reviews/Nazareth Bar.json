{"text":"I went to Nazareth yesterday and we lucked out because it was nearly empty inside (however it filled up within 30 minutes of our arrival and then there was a bit of a line.)  The service was fast and friendly, but there was a bit of a wait to get our actual plate, but it wasn't uncomfortably long. Our server checked on us regularly and was very pleasant.  We ordered one order of the vegetarian combination plate, and between the two of us, we still didn't finish all of it.  Over all it was a great experience, we got there at just the right time and the bill was ridiculously cheap."}
{"text":"I've tried other \"better rated\" Ethiopian spots in Toronto, but this is my fav.  For one, you can't beat the prices (under 10$ for 2), the service is great, atmosphere is wicked cozy, and the food....ohhh...what to say about the food.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.    It's not the type of place that you can make a reservations at, but even if all of the 4 or 5 tables are taken up, you won't wait long.  Service is pretty quick!    I've converted more than a few skeptics to Ethiopian food by bringing them here."}
{"text":"I had visited Nazareth before moving to the city, but I had forgotten the name and only remembered the general location. Since there are other Ethiopian restaurants in the area, it took a few tries to find Nazareth, but I knew as soon as we walked in, that it was the right place.   The food and atmosphere don't even compare to the surrounding Ethiopian restaurants, and the owner is very sweet. Usually she is extremely busy, so she may seem a little short with you, but trust me, she loves what she does, and she does it very, very well.   FOOD: I highly recommend the tibs! We always get veggie tibs, and they are so healthy and incredibly flavoured. They take a little longer to make, so prepare to wait. In general, the food is extremely consistent.  Also, since the food is so cheap, I recommend tipping well. I've been in the service industry for over 6 years, and she'll remember you for sure. (you always remember the really good ones, AND the really terrible ones...)  Also, bring cash - I don't know if they take debit/credit, and no one likes the transaction fees from ATMs. We've always paid cash.  WAIT TIMES:  The wait has definitely gotten worse over the last two and a half years, but that is only a reflection of the amazing value and delicious food. We're total pigs when we go in, so we buy two dishes to share amongst the two of us, but if you have a normal appetite, you can probably get away with a beer and one dish to share.   We've only had a problem with a really long wait once we've actually placed our order once - about an hour. It was pretty terrible. But that was such an abnormal thing. And it was right after they opened.  My suggestion would be to arrive around 5pm or after 8pm to minimize your wait. Once you are a regular, she'll probably start putting your food order in while you're in line."}
{"text":"\"Worth your buck\"  Con - Small , dingy, family owned place. Longer line ups and no reservations. No card and cash only. Service is slow and at its own leisure.  Pros - awesome, mouth watering food - worth the wait for. Once you get the service they make you feel at home.  Cheapest food in the heart of Toronto, humongous portions, 3 people can eat off 1 dish for 11 $.  Yelp helped us find the restaurant as we were craving Ethiopian, merely went with the reviews on Yelp. We were highly disappointed when we called and were told its empty and no reservations required. By the time we reached, it was full and we waited for a bit to be seated, even when the tables were empty.  It took time for them to get our order, but the staff is helpful with suggestions. Once our order came, all our bad reviews turned into, awesome Ethiopian food ever !! Would definitely go back !!"}
{"text":"If I wanted to leave a two-word review it would look like this: STAY AWAY!  I have never written a bad review, ever online but this time I had to. We've been going to Nazareth for quite some time, and the experience kept getting worse and worse. The last time we went, I had a food intoxication for several days. Yes you pay $10 (and granted the food tastes good) but there is a price for the meal: your health!  The owner is also completely out of her mind. She treats her customers so badly, I am amazed that people keep coming back. She literally yells at people, and God forbidden you order to take out. My friend called for a takeout an hour or so before pick-up and she yelled at my friend and said she was too busy to honour the order. And hung up on her! Yes, she hung up on a customer! The same thing had happened to me and I just thought I had called on a bad day. The owner is horrible and sacrifices food quality to lower the costs. Now I believe the rumours that she was shut down by Health Services a few months ago."}
{"text":"\"Nazareth\" is actually supposed to be named \"Nazaret\" Which is the name of the owner. She is the sweetest lady.  This is not a traditional restaurant, its more like going to eat at a family friends house. Casual, laid back, service reflects that. This place does not take reservations, there is almost always a lineup. Show up either early at 5 if you want to skip waiting. It is worth the wait either way.  Literally my favourite food in all of toronto. I always get the veggie platter because it comes with a bunch of different dishes. Split peas, lentils, collared greens, potatoes/cabbage, salad, injera and ayib (cheese). it's about 10$ for a platter the size of a human torso.  There are no utensils, like traditional ethiopian dining you'll be using your hands and injera to eat with.  If you're looking for a gluten free option they'll bring gluten free injera and iceberg lettuce."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food.  I love the injera and the various vegetarian and meat delights that are served on top of it.  Nazareth isn't a fancy place, it's tiny, but the food is pretty good, but the most awesome part is that it is cheap.  My boyfriend and I can share a vegetarian platter and both be wicked full for under $10.00 total!!! So good, tasty and cheap FTW!"}
{"text":"The perfect Ethiopian experience. The wait is certainly worth it, the staff friendly, and the food is unparalleled. Can't ask for a better meal at a better price."}
{"text":"People who poorly review this restaurant are out of their minds. This is hands down one of my favourite, if not all-time favourite places to come with a pal and share the veggie platter. It's always to die for - even if it does take 45 minutes to arrive. The owner cares about the integrity of her food - and she'll sass you good if you need a precious fork or any other training wheels for your meal. Which I merely find hilarious. Because it's amazing. And why you wouldn't be shovelling it in with your hands anyways is beyond me."}
{"text":"Great find. Really delicious food and very cheap. 5 of us ate a ton of food, had 4 beers and 2 glasses of wine for 55 bucks. The lamb is great!   Service is friendly but can be a little slow. There's only one or two people working so be patient!"}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of Nazareth! This food is just to die for! Full bodied, the perfect amount of spice, generous portions for a really low price - it doesn't get any better.  Well, some things could. You'll always have shoddy service here. It's just something you have to accept if you're going to go to Nazareth. Also, if you show up later than 5:30pm, you'll be waiting a LONG time for a table. So we always go for a really early dinner at around 5 so we won't hit the lineup. Honestly, if the service was faster, the turnover would be alot higher. But waiting 30 minutes for your order, and then another 20 minutes to pay once your done makes for long queues of people waiting to sit down.  But if you have your patience hat on, the food makes it all worth it. We always have the beef tibs & vegetarian platter with extra injera when we go. And we always have enough leftovers for an amazing lunch the next day!  I eat here at least 2-3 times a month. It's one of my favorite haunts, and I crave the food if I haven't had it in too long. This is spicy fare you will dream about for weeks to come."}
{"text":"Rude service, long wait for food, gluten free injera available but the food is not suitable for someone with celiac"}
{"text":"The food and prices are great but the service is slow. Get there early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house, so its an easy choice. You might have to wait a while for your food to come out. But well worth it. The Veggie Plate for 2 is what I usually get. Tons of lentils and ask for extra injira as I tear through it while trying to finish my plate."}
{"text":"The food ... oh gawds ... the food is AMAZING! This is the BEST Ethiopian restaurant in the neighbourhood, and probably the city.   However, the wait for a table and food ... well, it sucks!   Keep in mind, if you can wait 45 min -1 hr, you will get the yummiest food, so it will be worth it.    I've been coming here for about 10 years (before the expansion), and since coming here, have had Ethiopian food in most parts of Canada, and loads of places in Toronto. This place is by far the best (based on the veggie platter) I've had.   Here is the secret, if you are in a hurry: DO NOT COME HERE. Come here if you have time, and patience. Be prepared that you might be asked to move to the bar, when you finish your meal. This is so that people waiting in line (yes, there tends to be a line to get in), can sit down and begin the wait for the food.   Honestly, the veggie platter is the way to go here. Most of my lovely meat-eating friends order it over any of the meat options."}
{"text":"This place is a regular stop for us.  Very good food, veggie platter is exactly what you would want. Yes, service is slow. But that's part of the deal here.  And as others have said, prices are ridiculously cheap. Great value for the money."}
{"text":"That was a Meal that Ended My Career as a Restaurant Critic... adventurous and not costly   The most amazing tibs i've ever had. I'm still in shock with the enormous plating.  dancing drinking, Nazaret was amazing, ..."}
{"text":"Pros: 1) reasonably priced - cheaper than its contemporaries on the same street  2) delicious food. Ordered the veggie and lamb platter , and since one of us was purely vegetarian, the server was kind enough to get two separate platters - instead of combining veg and meat as is usually the norm. The food was yummy and hit the spot. Satisfied and satiated . Elated after you see the low priced bill !!   Cons: Long wait as the place is not very big : i had to wait for an hour to get a table and half hour more before the food arrived. So prepare in advance to wait. There is a small bar you can hang out at until the table is ready.  Food is worth the wait !"}
{"text":"The vegetarian plate injera is really good and they give you a huge portion for just one plate so you can definently share it with atleast two other people. The price of the food is excellent, however there is a long wait time even when you place a order to go but worth it because the food is just that good. I would definently recommend this restaurant for authentic ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Tucked away west on bloor, Nazereth immediately stands out for how busy it is and the delightful aroma coming out of this eatery. If you are unlucky like me and my dinner companions, you may need to wait quite a while to get a seat at this small restaurant.  Between the four of us we shared a lamb and a vegetarian dish. All the food is served on tasty Ethiopian bread. The Lamb and veggie dish were delicious and the food was abundant. The lamb was a little spicy but yummy. You can also get extra bread if you are ambitious like my friends and come with an expandable pair of pants!   This place also provides great value, between the food and beer my meal was 10$, including tip and tax!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I love the food, I love the fake trailing ivy on the ceiling, even the year round dim Christmas lighting.  When you come here DO bring a friend. I have shared the beef tibs, lamb tibs, and veggie platters on separate occasions. The food is always so flavourful and I always find myself wishing I had more to take home with me. The platters are always large enough for at least 2 people depending on how hungry you are. If you are a party of three, you might want to order 2 platters. They open around noon to till late but it gets busy very quickly for the late supper folks. DO try to get there early around 5PM, so that you don't have to line up. If you have to wait in line, usually you are salivating for a good 30 to 45 minutes. Let me tell you from first hand experience this is the most difficult thing to endure to do when you're craving and surround by such fragrant aromas. Although the service is slow for a small restaurant, my trusty server has never gotten my orders mixed up. For about $10 a plate (injera included) and $2 for every extra piece of injera, my favourite comfort food restaurant has truly unbeatable deals. DO come here often to get your Ethiopian fix!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and keep walking to the next ethiopian restaurant right after. I brought 2 friends to Nazareth and had a really bad overall experience.  Way understaffed, 1 waitress was just running around while too many people waited to be seated. Our drinks order took over half an hour and the food order took only 2 hours. Silly. Absolutely no reason to pay for any meal and get this kind of service. Food was good but certainly not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Delicious and so cheap for such beautiful and large portions. You have to be patient though as there isn't much staff for the amount of customers but the atmosphere, cleanliness and quaintness of the spot are fantastic."}
{"text":"Nazareth is an Ethopian restaurant run by a firecracker of a lady. We arrived at 10 p.m. on a Thursday night, but since the place was still packed, she was happy to seat us. We waited for about fifteen minutes in the tiny entryway, sipping wine and watching huge platters of food go by. The food is VERY cheap and VERY good and the portions are huge! The fish that we ordered was my favorite part of the meal. The carafe of wine was also cheap--and tasted like it! After dinner, we switched to ouzo. The waitress/owner brought us some samples and chatted with us a bit as the diners cleared out and some drinkers came in to sit at the bar. Overall, it was such a fun experience spending the evening at Nazareth--I will be back many times to come!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food and really good service.  Very reasonably priced menu.  We (two people) shared a veggie platter and a meat dish, and there was enough for four people or more!  This is a place I'd like to return to very soon!"}
{"text":"??????????????? ?????????????????? ???????? ??????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????  ?????????????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ?????????"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden Gem in T.O! Amazing food for such a good price! The only downside of this place is the amount of tables that are offered. There's always at least a 30 minute to an hour wait. However, it is worth the wait! :)  Staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Long wait but totally worth it. Service is understandably slow when it is jammed. One of the best bargains in the city. Truly authentic vibe and food"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I have ever gone to in Toronto.  Definitely one of my recommended places to go to, but only if you have a couple hours to spare, because as most users say, it takes a while to be seated, and another wait to get your food.    If you have the time, its worth the wait though.    Take out is also available.  I think."}
{"text":"Fantastic food for an incredible price! Busy and gruff service at times but food is worth it.   Ps. Tried calling for take-out at 8:15 one evening and they said they had run out of the injera. Thought that was sort of strange for a restaurant that would be open to the public for a few more hours?!"}
{"text":"The food at Nazareth is perfect. Ridiculously delicious, great for vegetarians and carnivores alike, huge portions, and absurdly cheap.  Everything else about eating here is a nightmare. It's always overheated and, since the food spicy and stewed, a dinner at Nazareth is an uncomfortably sweaty experience. A line-up is to be expected at a restaurant this good, but wait times are exacerbated by a lack of wait staff, slow table busing, and a general sense of disorganization. Poor service is the fatal flaw here. It takes ages to get extra injera or to get the bill. I've been given dirty water glasses and had my order of wine fail to arrive after several requests. No one knows the answer to questions about the food and preferences like having the meat and veg dishes served on separate plates are routinely ignored.   In another setting, this could all be charming. A small family-run restaurant serving amazing food but in an amateurish way... there's a certain delight in that. Unfortunately, at Nazareth, you simply get the sense that everyone is exhausted, overworked and exploited. I hope that's not true.   Every time I wait 40 minutes to get seated and have a terrible dining experience, I swear I'll never go back - but I always do. The food is THAT good."}
{"text":"Come hungry and with an abundance of time! I have been here three times, and I am always very happy with the food. After reading the reviews on yelp, I knew to come expecting to wait a long time for everything. I was for the most part pleasantly surprised. Though things do take a long time, it's all part of the experience. Enjoy a $3-4 beer and relax. The ambience here is just great. The place is small and completely covered with fake vines and fun colored dim lighting. Perfect for a date night, or just a good place to hang out for a few hours. Everything is so cheap and delicious. Each time I bring a friend and get the vegetarian special for two. It is always more than enough food for two people! I have also tried the beef tibs and they were excellent. The vegetarian special for two and an order of tibs would be perfect for a group of three. They have gluten free injera and/or can substitute the injera for lettuce leaves.  The only reason they lose a star is because while I am happy to wait to be seated and to wait for the food, during my last visit I waited a little over an hour for the bill while two tables beside us came, are, and went."}
{"text":"Two stars because it's cheap as hell and the dark 'authentic'ally kitschy interior is cosy and welcoming. The food is good enough, especially for the money, but it's not amazing. There's definitely better Ethiopian nearby.  The beer selection is awful. As if to highlight this the menu actually lists 'badweiser'. That spelling error was my favourite part of my visit.   I don't find myself inclined to rant about restaurants very often, but my experience at Nazareth can't be retold in any other way. I waited about twenty minutes in 'line'(more accurately just an incredibly disorganized jumble of people all hoping they wouldn't be overlooked when a table opened). I understand that waiting is to be expected as this place is small and popular. Fine.  Once I was given a table, I sat down to order a drink and wait for my friends (who were due at any moment) and pulled out a library book I'd just borrowed to look at while I waited. Apparently this was unacceptable. Nazareth booted me to the bar (despite my explanation that my friends were arriving any second) and gave the table away as my friends walked in. My friends and I spent the next half hour standing at the bar, drinkless!, waiting for another table to open up.   Worse than all that, perhaps, was that the woman couldn't bring herself to apologize. For the rest of my stay she made some mention of the situation every time she passed us, but not one of those mentions was an apology. I would definitely have left before eating but one of my friends love love loves Nazareth and was excited to share it with us.  Sadly, being small, busy and in with the hip crowd doesn't justify being rude. If I go back it'll be under duress."}
{"text":"After a grueling ultimate frisbee match, my friend Heidi took me to her favourite neighborhood Ethiopian restaurant - Narareth.  This cute Bloor and Ossington spot was busy still around 9pm when we got there still serving people on dates and groups who wanted some late night eats. (The kitchen closing only at 1am.)  It's quite intimate as you walk inside as it's dimly lit making it a very romantic spot.  I would definitely recommend to go on dates to and experience the essence of Ethiopia with authentic paintings and local art covering the walls while easy classic tunes play on.  While we were there, we heard classics like Wham's \"Never gonna dance again\", Lionel Richel's \"Hello\" and my personal favourite, Chris de Burgh's \"Lady In Red\".   There are limited menu items with three choices, beef, chicken or veggie. The most popular and Heidi's favourite being the veggie platter which the owner knew to get us as Heidi is a regular there.  The best thing about this place is the affordability.  Since the portion sizes are huge, you can order a platter that would be enough to share for 2 or 3 people for under $8.  The veggie platter came with all types of lentils, boiled cabbage, spinach, peas, salad mixed with all kinds of delicious spices.   With 2 coronas and a veggie platter, the bill was $15 with tax and tip!  Talk about value!"}
{"text":"Good food but the slowest service you will ever have.   Expect to wait 20 mins for a menu then 1.5 hours for them to make your food"}
{"text":"Pros: Good food, cheap drinks cons: long wait."}
{"text":"Honestly my favourite place to eat out of all of the cities I've lived in. 5$ a person and you can have vegan and not veg options. Regardless, it's cheap, healthy, filling and the atmosphere rocks almost as much as those serving.  This review is pretty biased because I love the place so, but take my enthusiasm as a note of how badly you need to eat here if in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food ... try the fish it's the best. It's small place so fewer tables and longer wait time."}
{"text":"Amazing food and prices but some of the most agonizingly slow service I've ever experienced. It's hard not to feel ignored in such a small space with ample servers around. I would come back but not when hungry."}
{"text":"Nazareth was packed as expected when we arrived. We were greeted after a minute or two of waiting in the doorway and were invited to sit at the bar for a drink until a table became available. Shortly afterwards a table at the very front window became free and we were escorted to our table.   FOOD We started with two beers which were inexpensive considering Toronto prices. All the alcohol is very reasonably priced and the selection isn't bad for such a small restaurant. I don't think I recall seeing any Ethiopian drinks on the menu.  We ordered the beef tibs and the vegetarian platter. Our food arrived in good time considering how busy it was in Nazareth. The presentation and selection was okay; the tibs and vegetarian items were separated by a nice fresh salad and served on a very large circular tray.  The beef tibs were okay. Most pieces of beef were fatty (which I don't like) and the dish was very oily which ruined the underlying injera and soaked its way into the vegetarian portion of the dish making everything difficult to eat and messy (no forks available). There's a photo that another Yelper uploaded (anji b) showing an oily mess of food that they received. I was dismayed when our food looking exactly like that (compare the photos linked in her review... I agree with what she is saying). The flavour pretty bland; there isn't any stew or beefy flavour to this dish.  The salad was fresh and crisp. I liked the vinaigrette dressing they used. Very light.  The vegetarian items were bland, kind of cold; very meh.  There wasn't as many different vegetarian items with the meal as I was expecting. Overall the meal was pretty bland and while I was full from the amount I ate, I was left unsatisfied with the flavour.   I will credit Nazareth giving a sufficient supply of injera for the entire meal right up front.  Atmosphere Nazareth really has a big city charm to it. Its small, dimly lit and always busy giving it a really nice vibe. There's fake vines all up in the ceiling, plants, candles and the bar warmly basks in a glowing red light. It has a dive bar feel in all the right ways and doesn't try to pretend to be some cheesy African themed restaurant. Cleanliness was okay, everything could use a solid bleaching but in fairness the bathrooms were very clean and nice. I wasn't expecting that. The ventilation isn't that great and you will smell like food when you leave.  Service Service was adequate. You cant avoid that this place is always busy and waiting for a table is a fact of life. We were seated as quickly as it was possible, our orders were taken promptly and the food arrived considerably quick for how busy it was in there. I think the staff was working as efficiently as they can with such a small space and at such volume. That isn't to say that you are rushed out the door because I wasn't given that impression (I had to ask for the bill rather than it coming mid-meal or when the plates were cleared). The staff aren't exactly friendly; it's all business with them. Some people see this as rude, cold, etc. and note the staff's forgetfulness. I really think the matter is their preoccupation with keeping things running the best they can as quickly as they can.    Comparison to Lalibela So here's the big question. Which of the two Ethiopian heavyweights do I prefer?  Décor: Nazareth wins by a landslide for décor. Warm, cozy, dark I even want to say mysterious? Lalibela was worn, dated and too grimy. Presentation: Lalibela's presentation of their food was superior. Everything was plated cleaner; saucy items were kept from running into other food and were in separate dishes. Service: Service was adequate at both restaurants. Lalibela was empty when we dined there and the waitress was a little friendlier but a less attentive than Nazareth. At Nazareth the place was packed and the waitress was colder but quicker with everything.  Food: Lalibela's food was superior The vegetarian platter came with more selections and has significantly more flavour. Lalibela had more complex flavours to their food and the food was significantly less oily and was served warmer.  My preference would be to dine at Lalibela as I felt the food was superior in flavour and presentation. Both restaurants are very similar in service and price and while Nazareth has a nicer atmosphere; the food at Lalibela is the deciding factor in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best injera in t.o hands down   Vegetarian friendly  The food has the most amazing taste   It's really busy and sometimes a 30 min wait but it's worth it  I would go on a weekday lunch/ early evening!  The owner of the restaurant is a sweet hard working lady  Seriously love this place must try!"}
{"text":"Be wary of the raving reviews...  If you're broke, on a budget and you want to pay $10 for a fresh meal and leftovers for an other day or two, Nazareth is your joint.  However, if you're looking for some decent quality, fresh ingredients and competent service, Nazareth is NOT your joint. Far from it.  I came here based on the restaurant's high rating... but shit, I called in for a pick up order and I was told about 30 minutes. I arrived there 40 minutes later. The joint was dead (9 pm on a Sunday). There were 2 other tables seated. And 5 minutes after I asked about my order, the cook came out to ask me how I wanted my meat cooked. Medium rare, please. 15 minutes later, I got my food.  Oh yeah, the lady running the show, who served me, and who also answered my call, could not have given a single shit about me being there. No apologies. Actually she barely spoke english.  Now about the food:  The good: Massive portions. My girlfriend and I could have shared just one platter. However we ordered two.  The bad: Cheap ingredients with a lot of grease and little to no taste.  My verdict: if you want a delicious cheap meal, go to Korea town."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good! Super cheap and HUGE portions. Got the vegetable platter (#7) and minced meat (#2).  However, I would A) never eat in the restaurant because like previous posters say the service is awful and you'd be waiting for a very long time     B) you call for pick up and they tell you 45 min to an hour  and you get there and it's still not ready."}
{"text":"As long as I exercise my patience I can enjoy going to Nazareth.  The first time I went I liked in a lot.  We sat down after a 5 minute wait and the anticipation added to the experience.  Also I had never been for Ethiopian food before.  It was ok... obviously I eyed the other people on my table remembering who had washed their hands and who hadn't.  The food itself was ok too. Although I ran out of the teff bread you use to scoop we asked for more and it came free of charge - which was nice. Since then the experience hasn't had as much of that new feeling and I have been annoyed with having to wait, standing up for 30 to 50 minutes - and adding to that the realization that the food itself is not that great.  In fact everything on the platter... lentils or sweet potato, maybe some spinash... ermm well it all tastes the same.  However the resounding thing that keeps me coming back are my friends that like the place, and of course the price.  I mean, $7.50 for a platter for two and bottled guiness for $3.50 - $4 means you can't complain too much and you just have to deal with it.  Mediocre food and service but as I and other reviewers have said, to eat, get full and have a drink all for under $10 for a sit  down meal isn't bad is it??"}
{"text":"Nazareth is one of our favorites. We have been going for years and they always remember you. Watch out, if you get there after 5:30pm on a Friday or Saturday you will have to wait half an hour or more because there will be a line to get a table even with their recent expansion.  Tip: You always seem to get the most bang for your buck when you go as a couple and make two orders. Seems you get proportionally more. You seem to get the same amount if you make three or four orders on one injera.  If you make an order for Beef Tibs and a Vegetarian they both come on one very large plate. The Beef Tibs is spicy and flavourful while the Vegetarian is a nice way to balance off the strong beef flavour. The Vegetarian dish gives you 6-7 different cooked veggies and beans/lentils/spinach (I think) and the large dish is separated in the middle with a leaf lettuce salad with a bit of cheese.  Takes a while to get the bill or drinks but I always go there for the food not for the service.  Overall the best Ethiopian restaurant by far."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto and in my opinion none of them beats Nazareth...from taste, to the vibe, the portions and the price.. However, if you get frustrated by long line ups and can't wait for your food to arrive, I suggest going to a fast food restaurant..Nazareth is super busy and makes every dish from scratch..I can personally wait hours for the food to arrive because I know when it does I would be a happy person :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and warm ambience! As a party of three, we ordered two veggie platters (intended to be enjoyed by four people), and we polished off the entire thing, no problem. Service is indeed a bit slow, but the food makes it worth the wait.   The dishes themselves are affordable (~$10.75 for an order that serves two people), but beware: extra injera comes at a cost, and a pricey one at that--$1.77 per person for each extra order."}
{"text":"Nazareth's is a really 'depends what you want' place-which is of course the point of reviews but also to say, not the place to go if you're just 'up in the air' or 'checkin stuff out'  if you want to sit and relax and enjoy service and have the option of eating light...not a good choice.  if you want to pay small amounts, eat a lot of tastiness, experience a 'toronto eatin hub'...it's paradise.  lineups happen and it's dark."}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto in September and Nazareth has become, at times, a second home for me. As so many people have noted, the food is amazing. The Veggie Tibs are always a hit, and a personal favourite is the Gored Gored. 10 or 12 bucks respectively and each will feed 3 ppl easy. All this has been discussed here, and rightfully so. However, I'd like to talk about the less yelped about after-dinner/late night scene.   Usually around 10pm the restaurant clears out (save a handful of Ethiopian folks at the bar). Amazingly groovy music is cranked, tequila shots and cheap domestic bottles are consumed until an inevitable dance circle is formed wherein all participants successively take turns showing off their moves. It is the best party in Toronto and exactly why I moved here: great community, honest conversations, tons of laughs and drunked-up silliness.   Nazareth is the name of the restaurant, the owner herself, and her hometown in Ethiopia. But it also stands for great food, cheap drinks, and the best place on Bloor to dance it up any night of the week. (Except Tuesdays).  Oh, one last thing: go there on your Birthday if you like feeling special."}
{"text":"Nazareth has its charms, and its notable flaws but when you get the bill, all sins are forgiven. Where else can me and 2 friends (one being a very hungry full grown man) stuff ourselves to the point of bursting for $22? TWENTY TWO DOLLARS. It leaves you scratching your head with Injera scented hands.   I judge all Ethiopian restos on the quality of their messir wat, which is my favorite dish, and Nazarath's is not bad. Not as good as their neighbor Lalibela, but still good none-the-less.   Every Visit is prefaced by a ridiculously long wait, as maybe 15 people can actually sit and eat at once. Additionally, the entire place is run by the owner, one woman acting as waitress, busser, cashier, etc etc. She is often scattered and sometimes forgetful, but she will be brutally honest and will not let you order more food than she thinks you can finish.   There is a bar if you like to sit there and wait, and observe the kitchen through a tiny service window.  Cash Only! and Go on Off hours, trust me. Standing against a wall watching people eat is really not fun. The room is so teeny, only a handful even have the privilege to wait inside.  Not good for inclement weather. And don't even attempt a party larger than 4 or you will be waiting FOREVER as she will seat deuces etc first.  Food is A-Ok, The price bumps this up a full star."}
{"text":"Have been here many many times and have come to think of this as our \"Nazzi experience\"  Long lines, longer wait for the food BUT so so worth it. If you can just be patient enough and withstand the hunger pains that will start to take over and might make you slightly weak; you will experience the deliciousness of the food that clearly comes from a combination of experience and immense passion.  The restaurant itself is small, hence the long wait times, but dimly lit making it the perfect place for both a romantic dinner for two or for a small group with close friends.  Eating with your hands is a MUST as there are absolutely no forms, but truly that's a huge part of what makes eating this food an experience above all else.  The veggie platter is by far the best, as well as the lamb and beef bits. One platter is definitely enough to share for 2 as the portions are huge.  All in all; good food, good atmosphere, GREAT experience!!!  P.S love taking the newbies here - amazing for beginners and novices alike."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the city, cannot go wrong. Top everything. Cheap booze, cheap food. Amazing service, amazing food. The ladies are so sweet."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to dining here because of all the good reviews I had heard. On the outside this place looks like nothing special but I thought the dark dingy ship-wreck vibe inside was kinda cool.   The restaurant was completely packed. It's small, so there were about 20 people and only one server for the entire place (so obviously service was slow). When our food came the waitress said \"First time here?\" and it was. Ethiopian food is eaten with your hands and I guess she thought we looked a little lost so she took a piece of the Ethiopian bread with her hands and grabbed a bunch of the food from our platter with it and then force fed me, sticking her fingers into my mouth!. She did the exact same thing to my boyfriend. She said she always did this to people. We laughed it off but both of us were definitely irked by this. My entire dining experience was tainted. Force feeding anyone at a restaurant is completely inappropriate, in my opinion, and when is it okay to stick your fingers in a stranger's mouth? My boyfriend and I have worked as servers, and I think most people can imagine that servers hands are not exactly the cleanest, as they are constantly clearing food, touching leftovers, wiping counters etc.  I didn't think it was funny. I was just disgusted and my entire dining experience was tainted by this.  (Please let me know how you would feel if a server did this to you! so that I know I'm being reasonable.)  The food itself was alright and 10$ for a massive portion that 2 people could get full from. We ordered the vegetarian platter and it looked like a bunch of mush. I believe there were some mashed sweet potatoes, mashed beans, lentils, and lettuce there. I didn't like the texture or taste of the bread and I would have much rather eaten the veggies with a fork. I would compare the mush to the inside of a burrito. The taste was okay. I know that my experience was tainted by being force fed at the beginning of the meal and I personally don't like the idea of eating with your hands. I would not return here, however most of the people around me seemed to be quite content.   Words of Advice: If it looks like she's about to force feed you and you don't want that experience, I urge you to say \"stop!\" I wish I had said that."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, no doubt about it. My bf and I got a vegetable combo and beef tibs, which made for a nice, flavourful combination. We certainly got full (and even had some left over). The beer was priced well too.   The problem, as a few of you already mentioned, was the service. There was a short line-up at the door, which we expected and didn't mind. What got us pretty angry was that about 3 tables cleared at the same time, and the wait staff were in absolutely no hurry to clean them off and seat new customers. They cleaned one off eventually, but didn't invite us to sit down for another 10 minutes for no good reason. Once seated, we had to wait another 10 or so minutes just to get a menu, then another 10 or so minutes to have our order taken. Our beer was forgotten for a while too. Our waitress kept trying to leave, even though we were not finished ordering.   So yes, the food was great, but I doubt we'll come back. Having to wait for an hour just to get some food makes no sense when there are so many other options around. Customer service, Nazareth!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much it hurts. It beats any other Ethiopian restaurant in Toronto. The food is always piping hot, flavorful and the injera is spot on. The booze is cheap. I've tried the veggie special, kitfo, and fish platter. I would eat all of them again. The veggie is my favourite. There is one important thing to note about Nazareth; the wait can be long. Sometimes the wait to get a table can be forty minutes. Sometimes you wait fifteen minutes to place your order. Sometimes you wait half an hour, maybe more, to get your food. But I honestly think the food is so unbelievable that it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday evening with my boyfriend, took about an hour from arrival to receive the food. We got the vegetarian plate (vegan) to share, it was great. Huge portions, we were super full and couldn't finish the plate (even though I tried). Super cheap. We were in love. Service was OK.  Went another time with 2 other people, we planned to share one plate since it was a friend's first time and we weren't that hungry. 3 different people took our order within the our between our arrival and after being seated. We were then approached by an older woman who said we had to order another plate since there's 3 of us. I told her we'd already placed the order 3 times and had been waiting there for over an hour and no one mentioned anything. She then left and sent over a younger woman, with dyed light brown hair maybe about 45-50 years old, who was extremely rude and told us we had to order another plate or leave. There was another table of 5 sharing two plates. We pointed it out and she said \"they are paying taxes (???)\". We asked why no one had mentioned anything since we had ordered and waited so long and she said \"If you don't wanna wait why don't you leave? Leave then.\" So we left.   3 stars because the food is delicious and dirt cheap and I will be back even though the service is atrocious."}
{"text":"Amazing, cheap food. Two people can eat for $5 each and get stuffed. Beer is cheep, too. Expect a wait if you come after 7pm, so this place is best for early dinners. Plus, the food tastes even better if you get there right when they open."}
{"text":"I have been to Nazareth many times and the food is always amazing. My boyfriend and I always get the same thing  - the vegetarian option with beef tibs. Beef is always tender and everything is seasoned perfectly.   A few things a first timer should know - this place is always busy and there is often a line. Wait in it - its worth it. The service is so-so but you will get what you've ordered and your drink will show up, eventually. The food is so good here that it makes up for wait time and service combined.   The prices are excellent and you will never leave hungry. Its quite the challenge to finish the entire plate."}
{"text":"I live in this neighbourhood so I know Naz pretty well. You don't go to Naz by yourself. You go with hungry cohorts. The food is truly flavourful, and even better when the check comes and you smirk saying \"oh I got this\". But because they thrive on their value, service is not exactly well, service. They may forget drinks. They serve at their own pace. Then I should rephrase: you go with hungry, conversational cohorts. Classy types need not apply. They don't own cutlery and may be insulted if you ask (yup, one's tried)."}
{"text":"One of favourite restaurants in the city, period. The atmosphere is warm, inviting, and unique. It's a small place with only about 10 tables and two staff so expect to wait...but your patience will be rewarded.   The viggie platter is the most popular dish, and for good reason. You get a great variety, it's filling, it's delicious, and it costs $12... FOR TWO PEOPLE."}
{"text":"The vegetarian platter for 2 is amazing. This was our first stop when we came back to Toronto. The quality of food makes up for the slow service. Good things take time."}
{"text":"As recommended by other reviewers I tried the veggie platter.  It was cheap and tasty.  Get there early as it is first come first serve for a table.  I went on a Monday night and there were people lining up at 7pm-8pm.  Small intimate space and can get quite noisy.  Only one person working the floor when we went."}
{"text":"absolutely delicious and affordable.  the beef was a little greasy, and if you have a sensitive tum, consider yourself warned, but the overall taste was worth it.  cool atmosphere too. dark interior with xmas lights and a jungle esq vibe"}
{"text":"This place was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. If you want to wait in a line without anyone acknowledging you're even there, seating yourself after an hour of waiting, wait another half hour for anyone to even talk to you, another half hour to get a drink, then wait for your food for over an hour and watch everyone around you get their good first even though you were there an hour before them, this is your place ! Even when the good finally came out it wasn't what we ordered so they decided the best option was to give away that good to a DIFFERENT table and walk away not telling us if the food we actually ordered was even coming still. Literally the only good thing about this place are the cheap drinks. Don't waist your time. It's Toronto, there are a million other better places to go for food. Will never return, which is sad because my whole table was really looking forward to this place. Terrible."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because the waiting time is ridiculous. However the food is so amazing and so cheap that if you aren't too hungry or in a bad mood waiting is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Needless to say- amazing food. You need to stand in line to get in but was totally worth the wait. The waiters were not super friendly though- but this may be because there were just two handling the whole crowd. They were not rude either. So- who cares"}
{"text":"The Naz.  Although it occupies a space in the neighborhood as a requisite stop on the cheap eats tour, Nazareth is certainly not among the better Ethiopian restaurants in the GTA.  Hell, it's not really even among the better Ethiopian restaurants on Bloor between Christie and Dufferin!  Still, there's something about this place that provokes an odd, almost instant defensive loyalty from their far-flung fan base.   Large portions, excellent prices and service that ranges from moderately disinterested to moderately annoyed make this a spot for eating with friends.  The small, randomly \"decorated\" space isn't going to impress anyone other than the recently paroled, still there is an intangible vibe to the place....    It's worth a shot, particularly during off peak hours.  If I had the waiting experienced by other Yelpers during my first visit I would be decidedly less kind in my review."}
{"text":"Nazareth serves up some delectable Ethiopian food. One of the reasons why I enjoy Ethiopian is because it's a great way to connect with others you are eating with. Eating with your hands prevents texting/playing on your phone, and is a good way to just enjoy the moment.  Portions are large and very affordable. I split a vegetarian platter ($10.61) with my dining partner and we felt like we over-ate. A single platter could easily feed three medium-sized appetites. Our motherly server was overjoyed that we finished everything on our plate.   As others have mentioned this is a tiny, popular restaurant with not the most efficient service, but in a way, it's all part of the fun.   The space is dimly lit, small, with Ethiopian music playing on the speakers and Ethiopian music videos playing on two large TV screens. Be prepared to wait for 1+ hr for a table if you show up around peak dinner hour on a weekend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is so flavourful and the portion sizes are huge, all for a beyond-reasonable price! The decor of the place makes you feel a bit like you're eating in a jungle. It's a small, cozy, and usually packed place. We always end up ordering too much, but i wouldn't complain about eating leftovers the next day! The seafood and lamb ones are my personal favourite, but the beef options are good too.The only problem is that there is always a very long wait, since i don't think they take reservations.. but trust me, when you sit down and take the first bite, it's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Ethiopian I have ever eaten and I've been to plenty. And it's so inexpensive. Nazareth could quite literally double their prices and people would still come and lineup out the door."}
{"text":"How do you give 4 stars to a place that has bad service? Well, the food is awesome and so is the price!  Get there early to avoid the lineups, and give yourself lots of time to sit there because you may or may not get the attention of the server for a while.  The prices are great, even on the beer!"}
{"text":"It's really nice being back in Toronto with all the different ethnic restaurants and neighbourhoods. Nazareth is in Little Ethiopia where there are at least 10 Ethiopian restaurants. We are really spoiled in this neighbourhood.  I haven't tried all of the restaurants, but I've been to about 5 over the years. Nazareth is by far the best one. The food is great. I've only had the lamb tibs, because why get anything else? The lamb is tender, flavourful and spiced with the type of blend that you can never duplicate in your own kitchen. It comes with salad, and a feta-type cheese (a little softer and less tangy.) The injera is good, but there is never enough to mop up all the juices. They will always give you more for free, but you have to wait.  Oh, do you have to wait. I've been three times and there has been a line out the door.  It helped that I was there with only one other person. We got in pretty quickly. If you go with a large group, expect to wait. Once you get in, the wait continues. It takes a good long while to get your food. I looked around once and saw nobody with food on their table. Maybe they should make bigger batches of food. I don't know. Also, hiring another waitress would help. Having said that, the staff is super nice.   The ambiance is great. Lots of dark wood, dim lighting, cool paintings and decorations on the wall. The other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to have been fairly dingy with very few people. Nazareth is always full of hip, attractive young people.   Finally, the prices are amazing. Lamb tibs costs $9 and can easily be split between two people. Beer ranges from $3 to $5. Moosehead is $3 bucks, and I always get about 3 to dull the pain of waiting.   In conclusion, if you have three hours to kill, Nazareth will definitely be worth your wait."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent value, customer service a tad off.  So I Yelped for an Ethiopian restaurant, and I couldn't help but notice everyone raving about the vegetarian platter at this one, so I figured I'd check it out.  I was there after 7pm on a Saturday, and the line-up to get seated went from the back of the little restaurant all the way to the front door. I was looking to pick-up the famous veggie platter \"to go,\" so I passed the line to the cash register. There, I was advised it'd be an hour wait time, so I decided to try this venue another time. I decided to try calling them from the car after I left, and I placed my order having been given a new estimated time of a half an hour. I came back 35 mins later, and was asked to wait another few minutes, which ended up being around another 15 minutes. In the meanwhile, I wasn't offered to pay or any water or anything like that, but I was invited to have a seat at the bar.  The food was quite excellent, however remember to bring cash with you as they're a cash-only joint. The veggie platter (or \"veggie dish\" as they called it) portion could easily feed at least two people, and it only cost $10 + tax + tip.  All-in-all, I'd definitely go back here not expecting amazing customer service, which is a fine trade-off for quite reasonably priced huge portions of food. I'll just remember to order well in advance for take-out, and I'll have to try to remember to get a pic of both sides of the latest ver of their menu for reference."}
{"text":"Tried this today on recommendation of a friend. I must say it IS cheap - three of us were sufficiently fed on one beef tibs order. It was very tasty, most of the beef was tender aside from a few stringy pieces.   I like the weird dark atmosphere. It was quiet, empty, and when we entered the staff were watching tv on a projection screen.. maybe mondays are just slow. My friend said normally it's real busy and they burn incense, but we didn't get that today.  3.5 stars says I'll be back to try a different dish : )"}
{"text":"If I were to summarize my experience at Nazareth by recalling some of the conversations here...  1) OMG, it's so busy here!  Let's just eat at the bar.  2) WHAT?! That vegetarian platter is HUGE, it's only $10?! We're sharing.  3) I have no idea what this is - but it's freaking tasty.  4) Use all five fingers.  LOOK!!! All five!  Just grab it!!!!  5) I told you to not eat all the injera. It's just spongy filler.  6) Ethiopian food - just too delicious.  So full now."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Could not be happier. Food was great and super cheap."}
{"text":"Yum. Call me Pavlov's dog... I'm drooling thinking about my meal here.   I was going to the Comedy Bar down the street and needed a place to eat. Cue the Yelp app, which led me to this place. Ethiopian is actually one of my favourite cuisines to eat right now, but I've been lax in just going to my regular haunts and not really trying other restaurants.   9 PM on a Saturday night, and the place was still full with a couple in front of me. It wasn't long, maybe 5 minutes before I agreed to be seated at the bar.  The first thing I noticed: the lack of peeling paint. Sorry, but my usual haunts are in need of a makeover (Queen of Sheba has now closed). Then again, it was very dark in the restaurant. I kinda like to see my food, but maybe they just dimmed the lights since I did get there late on a Saturday night.   The menu is small, with maybe 12 items on it. I don't remember a lot of explanations on it (but I was hungry at that point and I know my way around an Ethiopian menu without too much explanation). I settled on the vegetarian platter for $10. It came out and I was pleased to see that as other trusty Yelpers had reported, it was enough for two. The owner assured me she would wrap the rest up.   This meant I had to stop half way through because I knew that this really should feed two people. But I didn't want to stop. I wanted to continue sopping up those yummy lentils with my injera. I asked her - she said they make it in house. Definitely contains gluten, but I expected that. Oh well... it was a cheat day.   Oh yeah... and the beer. Keith's on draft for $4? Sigh. How can I refuse that? Cheat day.. right. I had two, plus paid for the beer of the guy beside me when he stiffed her.   There was an old guy drinking and swaying to the music in the corner. He looked happy.   I can't wait to go back and try out some more dishes."}
{"text":"Food ridiculously good and very affordable. Its a small restaurant and gets very busy. The service is not amazing, I think because it was only 1 waitress waiting on all the tables. Otherwise I would definitely go back. Veg platter"}
{"text":"I had had Ethiopian several times in my life and was convinced I didn't like it until I came to Nazareth on a recommendation. The food is completely amazing and crazy cheap! What am I eating? I don't know just give me more! (Vegetarian Platter)"}
{"text":"I'd gotten lots of recommendations for Nazareth from people telling me it was the best Ethiopian in the city, so went to check it out.  The food was mediocre, the place was loud and over-croweded and the servers were slow and indifferent to us. The place had a reputation for good cheap food, yet the prices were mostly higher than other Ethiopian places I've been to, at least when you consider the portion size.  The only thing I can think is that maybe they do meat well. I'm vegetarian, so I didn't try it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Nazareth.  The key is to know WHEN to go.  There's a magical pocket of time, just before or after the dinner rush...you just have to make sure you get there within that pocket of time.  Otherwise, you'll be left waiting for a while.  It's not a terrible wait.  Just roll up at the bar and order a drink.  That usually makes the wait that much quicker.  I always get the vegetarian dish to share with my partner.  It's always more than enough food for the two of us.  The veg platter, with an alcoholic beverage for each of us usually costs around the $15 range (with tax)...which is awesome when you're low on cash.  The service is always friendly, even when it's super busy inside.  The reason why I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because the serving size.  It's huge.  And I'm the type of person who will stop eating when full.  You can't do that here.  You get a bit of a guilt trip when you don't finish all the food on your plate - which is totally fair...  I can't eat it every week for that reason (too much food!).  But other than that, you can't beat it for the price.  I've been to other Ethiopian places, and they just don't compare."}
{"text":"Mhmmmmmm so yummy n affordable BUt they've been closed for vacation. Wish they posted that online so  I didn't get disappointed twice."}
{"text":"IMHO bland food, crowded and slow service. Only thing it has going for itself is the price point and the portion size."}
{"text":"I am a long time regular here, and have to say, that this is probably the best Ethiopian food place in Toronto because it scores highly on all fronts, and does so consistently. While it might not be the best every single time, on average, this place is the best, and when its at its best, it definitely is the best (that was confusing I know).  this review is a combined review of my usual order (previously ordered over 20 times): veggie platter, doro wat. diet coke sometimes.  service: 2. yes its slow as hell everyone is correct on this end. this is the worst feature about this place. you should probably come here when you are not hungry, because by the time you are seated, your order is taken, the food is prepared, can realistically be 1.5-2.5 hours. so get ready to wait. the owner lady is nice and accommodating, but this does not make up for the slowest times in toronto (easily), now that I think about it, it is slower than the wait times in cuban resorts, where the workers are notoriously slow because there is simply not enough labour force to go around. anyways.  food: rated 5: fresh, delicious, both injera and the food itself. everything is great, thats how I will sum it up and i wont go into detail, because it simply is great and thats all!  portion size: rated 5: great portion size, large compared to other restaurants, and large compared to other Ethiopian restaurants.    price: rated 4: around 25-30$ for two people all in. not bad.  overall: killer value for the price, go here when you try to discover the inner Ethiopian. Although be forewarned that this food (if you never tried) it) takes times to getting used to, but this is the place to do it."}
{"text":"Nazareth c'est la valeur sûre en matière de cuisine éthiopienne à Toronto, la file d'attente peut durer jusqu'à 30 minutes mais ça en vaut la peine. Le principe est simple vous commandez une immense assiette de viande et légumes et vous vous servez de galettes pour manger le contenu."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had for my entire 26 years on this planet. We were in the restaurant for 2 hours with no sight of food.   1) waited in line for 40 minutes 2) Got seated and placed our orders 3) Waiting for a bit over a hour until I had to ask the waitress about our food, got a super irritated response back saying its coming 4)waited for another 20 minutes until we saw food coming our way, but no its for the table beside us who came 30 minutes later 5) asked the waitress what was going on and got a rude reply saying people ordered their food while they were in line and we had to wait our turn 6) This is when I absolutely f*cking had it, threw down my money for the beer and stormed out of the damn restaurant.  No amount of heavenly food and cheap price can make up for my anger experienced at this restaurant. If you can afford food that costs more than $10, stay away."}
{"text":"This place was definitely worth the wait! We came in on a Saturday night at 5:45 pm for a table of 5. We waited approximately 40 minutes for a seat and then 45 minutes for the food. I guess with a bigger party, the food took longer because the tables that ordered before us got their food first.. but that was okay as the food definitely made up for it!   Each order fills two ppl! We were going to order 4 things but were told that it would be a lot of food. We ended up trying 3 items: vegetarian tibs, kitfo and lamb tibs. Most, if not all, fishes are spicy. Not burn your throat or tongue spicy. It was more a hotness that only was found in your mouth. Very interesting. My favourite was definitely the lamb! There was a ton of meat and the flavour was spectacular!  The vegetarian dish was also very unique. Many unique dishes in one. A great choice to try the many different flavourings and spices of ethiopia!  Ethiopian food is my new favourite and out of the one's i have tried in Toronto, this is definitely my favourite! I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I called to make reservations for Friday night. The woman on the phone yelled something I didn't catch, and then hung up on me. Thinking perhaps we had been cut off, I called back. The woman said that I didn't need a reservation, there was lots of space. I told her it was actually for Friday. She said no need for a reservation, and then hung up on me AGAIN. Which would have been fine if I had showed up and there had been space. Showed up on Friday and there was a line out the door.  1- Don't hang up on people 2- If you don't take reservations, just say so, don't tell people that there is always lots of room  Didn't end up going here obviously, and I don't think I ever will. I went to African Palace next door. The service was excellent. I'd say go there instead."}
{"text":"This was my go to favourite Ethiopian restaurant. You get a lot of food and for a great, affordable price. The place is always busy so you may expect longer than usual wait times but definitely worth the wait. Nazareth has been closed down for awhile but I hope the re-open soon."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Nazareth in several years and decided to give it a try again. I was shocked and appalled and I'm writing this review as a public service announcement.  I ordered half vegetarian and half seafood and received a plate of bland, colourless schlop, so greasy it was inedible. I mean a complete oil slick.  The moral of this review is really to let you know that QUALITY Ethiopian food is just down the street at Nunu or Addis Ababa. Two sisters' restaurants close to each other on Queen Street between Dovercourt and Dufferin.  I encourage you to compare photos. Here's my photo from Nazareth:  http://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C7A8ft_YOFN8mvEPVX0reg/l.jpg And here's what you'll get from Nunu or Addis Ababa:  http://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JX61JCQ417ShrvBb9X3tlw/l.jpg See what I'm saying?  Pro tip: Always order the mixed vegetarian plate no matter which Ethiopian restaurant you're at."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian Ethiopian the city has to offer. When family is in town we always bring them here for a fun communal  meal. Cheap cheap cheap! The beef tibs are pretty good too! Worth the ample lines, go wait and roll up your sleeves."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian food in town. By far! But be prepared for a long wait as the place is always packed and service is slow, but it is totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"I do not recommend vegans dine here. I went to Narareth Bar for dinner last night. The atmosphere was warm, dim-lighted and jungle-like. The interior design is luscious tropical forest with the aid of fake leaves hanging from the ceiling. The menu did not consist of appetizers. All the dishes are the same price- 10.61$. My friend ordered seafood platter and I ordered the vegetarian platter- both platters were shared on one big plate separated by a line of iceberg salad therefore  I do not recommend vegans dine here.I ordered vegetarian platter and spat out two tiny cattle bones from my platter. Butternut stew, lentil stew, potatoes, cabbage stew sat on beef juice.The smell of beef lingered on my fingers throughout this morning. Narareth Bar run out of hot spiced tea when my friend tried ordering for it."}
{"text":"On our never ending search for novel experiences, we headed to Nazareth Bar to experience Ethiopian dining for the first time. Not knowing much else other than that we were soon to be eating with our hands, we walked into the restaurant on a Friday night. You'll promptly see that the restaurant is quaintly small, which makes for a bit of a wait for a free table. As you wait, you'll take in the warm, dim atmosphere, and be teased by the hearty aroma of your impending Ethiopian food experience. Bringing a small group is fine, but I would suggest keeping it under five.  The big deal about Nazareth is the variety of injera dishes that they serve. Injera itself is a porous, and essentially spongy sourdough flatbread. It is not bounding with flavour, which leaves room for the various toppings to shine through. You eat the dish by tearing off pieces of injera and using that to scoop up the toppings. We ordered the kitfo and the vegetarian special. Despite each dish costing $10.61, we were advised that were we about to be served a substantial amount of food, so were we stuck to our choice for the three of us. The dish was served on a platter with both the kitfo and the veggie special on the same injera. The kitfo is minced lean beef, butter, and mitmita (i.e. typically chilli peppers, cardamom seed, cloves, and salt). The first couple bites were delightfully buttery and really hit the spot, but would have quickly become too one note had we only had the kitfo.  That's where the veggie special came in. Honestly, the veggie special wore the pants in the relationship on this plate. The special comes with various components including: lentils, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, green beans, spinach, kale, and a strong white cheese. None of the veggie components are going to knock your socks off, but together with the injera, and various combinations of the items on the plate, you'll be satisfied viscerally. Honestly, I wouldn't order any of the meat dishes without the veggie special.  Though the food was pretty damn good, I have two beefs. Firstly, the seating room is small to the extent that you will likely be bumped a number of times during your stay. Secondly, after we waited in line for ~30 minutes, we had to wait for ~1 hour to get our food. The staff are relaxed, fun, and welcoming, but it looks like they aren't necessarily hustling and bustling to get you your food. That being said, it's hard for me to complain since the waitress is so welcoming that you feel like she's your aunt, and that you should just be patient.  I would probably try one other Ethiopian restaurant first, but I'd be happy to come back with a couple friends for a calming and soul warming African dining experience."}
{"text":"Get the vegetarian platter, it's DELICIOUS! Plus, it's relatively cheap for a restaurant. I always go with a friend and get a vegetarian platter for two, and it's $12. Love this place! The downside is so many people love it that you will be waiting for your table, and sometimes they are kind of forgetful (I always ask for extra injira and they sometimes forget). But overall, great place!"}
{"text":"I know Nazareth has been reviewed more than a few times, but I wanted to add my two cents.  I live not far away, and we eat her veggie platter regularly, both in the restaurant, and take out. We usually get three servings out of it, and it costs under $10.00, and it's fabulous!  We usually call ahead to order it, and sometimes walk in, but that can be a little stressful because of all the people waiting! A couple of times we've gone in to order, and she's just said \"no, not tonight\"..... I guess because she's too busy?  Hopefully once she gets a liquor licence for the new half of the restaurant, she'll add some tables.... and maybe some staff to help her out."}
{"text":"This is a very small restaurant and they only accept cash. The place was packed and we waited for like 45 minutes for our food to arrive. We were so hungry that we devoured it within minutes, it was so good (I think we ordered the beef tibs). I've heard good things about their veggie platter so I would like to try that next time."}
{"text":"I have had my share of Ethiopian food over the years and although I can now proudly say I am certified when it comes to distinguishing good over passable Toronto Ethiopian cuisine, I do not know enough about the True Authentic Taste of real Ethiopian and I do not have many friends who have either so I can only wager with what I have tried here.   Having said that, Nazareth has great, great food. That is of course, after being well aware that Nazareth is a city in Israel and not in Ethiopia.   The first couple of times I went there I was taken during the day and thus never experienced the crazy waiting times that will await you if you dare to come for dinner, specially during their most popular nights... which is every night.  Eating with your hands is fun and a love the fact that it is communal eating. Plus the servings are large and generally inexpensive.   ** Warning: If you are a germophobe, this might not be for you! **  The cuisine here is strong on the veggies, a little more so than meat, where you will find a lot of lamb but not a lot of chicken. The food can/tends to be on the spicy, however, since spicy is the spice of life, I have no problem with it, however some may. The last person I took there complained a bit about stomach discomfort while I felt totally fine.   ** WARNING: Mileage may vary depending on your digestive system. **  Now, back to the restaurant... Nazareth is smallish, thus it getting packed quickly and the long line ups. However if yo can get in, it is a good place to bring the uninitiated and beginner alike since the place has a nice Eastern decour and the food is good enough to be enjoyed by everyone.   Highly recommended. If you can get it. Large groups are not advisable."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 5:45 on a Thursday night and sat ourselves after waiting for the server to notice us for about 5 minutes. She seemed to be digging in the beer fridge for quite some time. So long that 3 other customers got up from their tables and went to the bar for service hoping to get her attention.  We decided to stay after waiting and waiting again to be given menus as we had read many good things about the place. Finally we ordered beef. It was obvious from the meat gristle in every bite that the meat was very low-grade but still the flavour and seasoning was good.  When the servers did drop by our table they were very pleasant.  The total at the end of the meal was amazingly low. Especially considering I got two generously poured glasses of wine.  Still, we won't go back. It just wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Okay after several failed attempts at dining here, I finally got a table.  I came with the Hubster, who admitted to enjoying Ethiopian, but never really craving it. Things might change now. We had the lamb tibs plus a veggie combo, and it was all incredible. The lamb in particular was the best I've ever had. It was perfectly flavourful, moist and soft. This will haunt my dreams for sure.  The only problem was that service was pretty slow and we were both incredibly hungry. We were completely happy once we got our meal, though, and were happy to somehow beat the dinner rush at 6pm.   We'll be back, and likely, at an earlier-than-usual dinner time."}
{"text":"The staff are moody and the service is terrible yes.  But they are always slammed there because the food is great and the value is even better. Only a few choices but the veggie special and beef option were amazing. It's messy food you eat with your hands. It's a bit oily but no different than curry. Really good. Go early to get a table any day of the week."}
{"text":"4 star rating overall.....let's break it down.....  Pros:  1) The most delicious & satisfying food!  2) Communal style eating, shared platters, eat with your hands kinda place.  3) Beautiful food presentation.  4) Gigantic food portions.....enough to take the leftovers home and have lunch for the next day, and the day after that.  5) Kitschy dive bar environment if you're into that sort of thing.  6) Exceptionally cheap.....they could raise their prices by 50% and this place would still be affordable for the quality of food.  7) Cheap beer and wine.....gotta love that : )   8) Naz, the owner, runs the show every night, and is the hostess, server, cashier, and probably the cook to some degree as well. She's an amazing woman and runs her business her way. Gotta respect that as this place is packed every single night. It's fun to watch her in action.   9) You will leave satisfied and full : )   Cons:   1) Always packed after 6pm. It's a small space, not much wiggle room, and it gets pretty warm. If small dark packed spaces and poor air quality make you uncomfortable, this is not the place for you.  2) Expect to wait.....not only for a table, but also to order food & drinks, then wait again for drinks, then wait for your food, and finally, wait for your bill. Each waiting period can be from 30 minutes to 1hour. My first visit was 3.5 hours which included waiting 1.5 hours for a table, and waiting another hour for our food......and this was on a Thursday night.  3) Do not arrive in starvation mode. Have a snack before you come. Since you could be waiting over 2 hours to actually have food on the table in front of you. I say this from personal experience.  4) Cash only, although there is a bank machine with a $2 service charge on site.  5) House wine is the only wine available.....the white is better than the red.  6) Service is the best it can be under the circumstances. It's tiny, it's always packed, they do the best they can with the space available. Naz, the owner, is hands on and running the show. She's a character, and is always friendly, as long as you're cool with her terms......which you can figure out after one visit.  7) Do not attempt to dine here if you are on a tight schedule.   8) Not great for groups over 4 people.....there isn't much room.   - Overall, the food is so delicious and affordable, all the cons are personally worth it for me. I have a lot of respect for the owner. It's one of my favourite restaurants in the city. This place is definitely an experience unlike any other."}
{"text":"Shared the vegetarian special and beef tibs with a friend. So much food for two people!! And it only came out to $15 each, with 20% tip.   We were both rolling out of there by the end...prob could've gone with just one selection, cause we were both too full afterwards. They don't do take out, so my tip would be to bring your own tupperware.  I'd definitely get the vegetarian special again to share. I wasn't that impressed with the beef tibs - texture was a bit tough. I find that with Ethiopian restos, the key is good injera - and Nazareth certainly has good injera!  Atmosphere is nice and cozy, and service was good."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times and thought it was decent but I'm a bigger fan of some of the places down the street and on the Danforth.    I have had veggie platters at probably over 20 different Ethiopian restaurants and this one is nothing special. The lentils are kind of mushy and the potato cabbage mix tasted a bit burnt. This place gets 3 stars instead of two because of the portions and prices."}
{"text":"I generally try to avoid posting negative reviews, -- but this place is just too monstrously overhyped not to. And yet, before I proceed to a rather dreary and unpleasant elaboration on why I finally decided to boycott Nazareth, I do have to admit that THE FOOD here does indeed taste quite amazing. The vegetarian platter (a combination of spicy stewed vegetables, spinach and lentil wats and a lettuce+tomato salad served on injera) can easily feed three people at THE PRICE of just 8 dollars. As Val S. already mentioned, -- this does sound like a great deal up until you meet the staff. The first time a friend of mine took me to Nazareth I was seriously wondering what I was doing with my life. After WAITING in line for about half an hour we were finally seated in a place that looked more like a set of an 80's action movie (dim lights, fake jungle plants, posters of Ethiopian beauties and all the other attributes, except for, perhaps, Steven Seagal), -- just to be completely ignored for another 20 minutes, until our existence was finally acknowledged by THE SERVER that casually threw the menus on the table while making a facial expression of a disgusted richman throwing a quarter into a homeless kid's cup. About 15 minutes from then the lady finally showed up to take the order, and so began the 45 minute wait for it to arrive. Not cool #1, Nazareth. As I was waiting (and starving, which didn't help the case either), I was involuntarily exposed to series of other alerting observations. One of which included a couple seated just a few tables away having a fight with the infamous server and eventually leaving, because she (drumroll?) refused to clean the table off the leftovers of the previous customer's order. Not cool at all #2, Nazareth, and in fact totally unsanitary. Nevertheless, the food was splendid, so after all I decided to blame it on a bad day and give Nazareth another chance. The second time I came in to pick up an order I was under the impression of making over the phone. As soon as I arrived the very same lady, that captured my heart with her divine social graces and victorian English the last time, informed me that there was no such order, and that I have to wait for at least an hour for it to be ready. Again, not cool at all #3, Nazareth. While waiting (again) I learned through a conversation with another tortured customer, that the place does not even make its own injera. That's really mean Nazareth, you're charging 4 dollars for the additional, while the entire roll can be bought from the bakery down the street for the same price. I have honestly no idea what brought me and my companion in the third time, but upon being ignored after trying to get the woman's attention multiple times, questioned on how many more people are going to join the table and when they will be getting out, and finally -- refused seating two hours before the place is closing, because \"there is no more food left\", -- I am definitely not returning ever again. The food might be better and cheaper than in other Ethiopian places, -- but it is simply not worth it."}
{"text":"20+ visits: Food is exceptional and totally worth the wait.  The staff is great and the atmosphere is comfortable.  Tips:  Arrive by 6pm and you generally avoid the line. Closed on Tuesdays (which always seems to be when we're craving it) Order veggie every time (delicious) and mix either beef or lamb tibs. Don't ask for a fork ;)  (seriously - if you're a noob, bring your own utensils 'cause they don't have any)"}
{"text":"Don't be swayed by the exterior. Come inside, and you'll see it's quite inviting.   Came again with some friends late on a Saturday night.  There was one party in front of us, but we had to wait over an hour for a table for 4. There were some 2 seaters available however.   We noticed that people wouldn't get served until at least 20 mins into their sitting.   The lady who works there was really good in ensuring we order first as were at the half way mark of our wait, so that the minute we sat down, we had our order.  We got the veggie platter again. Also a meat dish, Tibs (but with chunks of meat) i found it difficult to grasp with the Injera. I liked the veggie platter the best."}
{"text":"I really love Nazareth! Cheap drinks, cheap food that tastes good and friendly service.   It is a small place and whenever I have visited here had to wait for a table...but it is certainly worth the wait. I love the vegetarian dish but I cannot see past the lamb tibs. Injera and lamb tibs with some beer...heaven!   The owner is lovely and always seems to remember a face...well she remembered me!   Service was fast and the atmosphere is very relaxed. Despite the queue of people I did not feel rushed.   Lots of food for the price, I have always left stuffed and satisfied.   Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"** Caution: My review is written as a local to this hood. If you travel across town to eat here, you probably will be disappointed. I accept the place as it is.**  I love this place. I've been eating here for years and everyone I bring here loves it too. I always get the vegetarian plate for $7.50 which will leave 2 people feeling stuffed. At that price, I don't know how you can leave unhappy. You get plenty of injera (the sour, unleavened bread made from teff flour) and Nazaret, the owner, will always bring you more if you need it. The wats are delicious and even the salad has grown on me.   At this point I just eat the salad with my hands to save on injera and room in my stomach for the wats. It's just dark enough in there that you can undo the button on your skinny jeans without anyone noticing. Wear a long cardigan for extra gut releasing coverage.   The veggie platter is the most popular dish at Nazareth and can vary in size and presentation but almost always comes with spinach wat, stewed chunky vegetables, a couple of lentil wats ranging from mild to medium spicy embanked by a wall of onion and tomato salad on a base of injera. It's served on a long platter that leaves little room on the 2 person tables for anything but the two side plates of injera and your drinks.  Since expanding the restaurant into the retail space to the west where Pam's Roti used to be, the restaurant has doubled in size. High five if you remember when this still tiny restaurant was just a hallway with tables on one wall and only locals knew about it. Sigh. Those days are gone.  The crowd here is usually white and some asian 20 & 30 somethings, usually during the dinner hours and as the night progresses it transitions to the north/east african but usually lining the bar to drink and watch sports. If you show up at prime time any night of the week you can expect to wait 30mns -1 hr+ for a table and wait in a big line-up. It's better to go late in my opinion, after 9.  Tuesday they're closed and despite what the menu says, they are not open for breakfast or lunch, ever. Whenever I've asked Nazaret what her opening time is she says around 3pm or whenever, but I've seen it closed after 3. I doubt you're reading this because you're interested in breakfast though.  Nazareth is open late most nights. I've rolled in there at 10pm to enjoy a full meal without a wait for a table and then hung around for an ethiopian dance party complete with Teddy Afro music videos on the projection screen into the wee hours.   Moral: Veggie dinner for two and two spiced teas WITH tax and tip - $15.    NO RESERVATIONS! Don't complain that you couldn't get a reservation. She doesn't take them!   Waiting to pay your bill? Get off your ass and go pay at the cash register. This is not your average fancy restaurant with amazing table service.  Cash only but now there's an ATM terminal."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Nazareth for a while, and ended up leaving without eating! By far the worst service I've experienced in Toronto. I arrived by myself around 8:30 on a Monday. It was busy, but not packed. I walked in, and an older woman who was walking around glared at me, then ignored me. The tables were full, so I took a seat at the bar. The same woman walked behind the bar and ignored me some more, then another woman asked what I wanted. I ordered dinner and a beer. They had 4 kinds of beer but were out of 3, so I asked for the 4th. A few minutes later, she put a mug in front of me, told me that was the last one, and pointed to a guy behind me telling me he also wanted it. Um, 1) don't run out of all your beer? And 2) if you run out of something, just give it to whomever ordered it first. Don't put it in front of them then try to guilt them into giving it to someone else. After one sip, I realized it was skunky anyway. A few minutes later the server noticed I hadn't drunk any of my beer, so she grabbed it, stuck her tongue in it, and took it away. I wasn't offered anything else to drink as a substitute.  A few minutes later, a plastic bag was unceremoniously dumped in front of me, then the server disappeared. I didn't even realise it was supposed to be mine since I hadn't asked for takeout. When she returned, and wanted to be paid, I said I hadn't ordered takeout. First she said she assumed I wanted takeout because I hadn't asked for a table. Then she said she asked if I wanted takeout and I said yes (conceivable, I guess. It was so loud in there she could have asked me something I didn't hear or misunderstood- but I don't remember anything like that happening. And generally if someone orders a drink, they plan to eat in.)  Anyway, I said that I had wanted to eat in, not get takeout, and was really unhappy with the service. She agreed that there was no reason I should pay for anything, and I left, hungry.  I live in the neighbourhood and love Ethiopian food, so I'm disappointed to have to scratch this place off my list. Good thing African Palace 2 doors down has good food, is less crowded, and has better service."}
{"text":"dear customer nazareth restaurant is actively running. please do not accept those who spread false information. it is running the business in excellent condition. come and visit us you will be a wonderful services."}
{"text":"This will be my farewell review.  I tried to like this place ever since I started going, been there a half a dozen or so times, and I am finally giving up.  I'd rather pay the extra few dollars per plate for better service and more flexibility, as in servers who actually listen to you and give you the right food.  Their food is OK and they have absolutely no service.  That's fine, you are not there for great service or great food anyway, you're there for cheap booze and cheap food.  while other Ethiopean restos charge you $12 or $13 for a plate of kitfo, this place charges you $10.  When I went there for the first time they had a menu which said $7 or maybe $8 per plate.  However, when I picked up the tab I was charged $1 extra for the doro wot I ordered.  I asked why, and I didn't understand what the server was saying.  She said something about portions being big and taking her more hassle to prepare, etc, which sounded more like an excuse to me than a legitimate explanation for the extra charge, but I just figured they raised the price and forgot to update the menu.  After all, a $1 difference was not a big deal.  Now, I work with a group of Ethiopian food lovers and often place orders for takeout of some $100 to $150 worth of food, about 10 dishes.  That's a lot of food in Ethiopian and I know they need some time to prepare, so I usually call the restos well in advance.  If they say 1 day ahead, I call them a day ahead.  If they say 1 week ahead, I give them 1 week.  If they say come pick up on their least busy day/time, I do.  Nazareth, however hangs up on you when you try to place an order.  I called the resto a few times on different occasions to see if they can accommodate, and the server kept hanging up on me but one day said they don't take advanced orders, and told me to just come.   So I went there on one weekday afternoon thinking it'd be better to go on a less busy time, asked if 10 dishes can be taken out.  Sure enough, the server says they need advanced notice, to call them ahead of time.  I ask how many days?  The server goes into the kitchen to discuss with the cook, comes out and says they can't do it at all.  I ask, even if I order 1 week in advance?  They say no.  They say, the more I order the more they lose money because they charge less than other places, and tell me to go to other restos.  So I suppose they want customers who eat in and drop more money per plate with tip and alcohol than accommodate takeouts.  Well I usually do leave tip on takeouts anyway, but that's OK.  I can understand that when you try to offer food for less, there are certain rules that they need to impose, written or implied.  Now, the reason I am giving up is not for the lack of service, or because they can't do large orders, or because they charge $1 or 2 more per plate than what the menu says.  It's because they won't listen.  That's sad. When I order kitfo at an Ethiopian restaurant, I always ask for raw.  Other restos will listen to me and will give me raw meat.  Nazareth, unfortunately will take my order and give me medium rare or almost well done.  When I tell them that's not what I ordered, they won't even exchange, saying they'll lose money.  Of course you'll lose money if you don't give customers what they ask for.   After ordering kitfo two or three times, and even writing it down on a piece of paper \"raw\" and \"not cooked\" one time, and still getting cooked meat, I am finally giving up. I even asked if it was their policy not to serve raw meat, they said they do do raw kitfos.  Why they won't do it for me, I don't know.    I will still recommend this place for someone who is not 'particular' like me, as in wanting $100 or more to take out on occasions, or absolutely wants the meat uncooked.  It's hard to beat their price, and as long as you can accommodate them and not expect them to accommodate you, you'd be fine.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Added February 9, 2012  After reading the other 1-star reviews, I wonder if the lack of service and unability to exchange mistaken orders (i.e. cooked kitfo) resulted from me being a visible minority.  If that's the case, then that's really sad.    I see raving reviews about great service at Nazareth and it's hard to believe that we were talking about the same restaurant.  I can understand inconsistent service, but it seems that people who get great service always gets great service, and others (like me) always get terrible service at this place."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a better deal in the city than Nazareth ethiopian food. It's often cheaper to eat here than to eat at home. I've checked out lots of Ethiopian restuarants in the city, and even the more expensive ones don't come close to Nazareth.Their vegetarian platter is only $7.99 and serves two! $4 dinner?!   The decor is interesting with an eclectic crowd - a mix of students and locals.The owner is friendly but stern, and not afraid to let you know your time is up and that you have to pass your table on to the next group waiting at the bar. But she never forgets a face, and will welcome you back and remember your favorites for next time."}
{"text":"I've tried most of the Ethiopian restaurants on Bloor out, and even if Nazareth wasn't the cheapest I would still go there because I think its the best (I only ever order the veggie option).  Nazaret, the owner is the loveliest person, always remember me and my boyfriend, and when we bring other people always asks who they are and is just generally amazingly nice.  You might have to wait and it might be disorganized, but it's absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"From the outside, it looks like a deli/corner store. On the inside, it has a shipwreck vibe if that makes any sense. Low ceilings, dimly lit, kind of dingy but in a pleasant way. Cheap drinks and very cheap food that is tasty and has just the right amount of spice.  The vegetarian platter will feed 10 people! Ok maybe not 10 but easily more than 2...and it is $10. No tax??? Ok. The veggie platter is also good for take-out. It will feed you for days."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian food I've ever had! I went with a friend in the evening and we had to wait 2 hours from the time we walked in to the time we received our food. The place was PACKED and the line stretched the length of the hall/entrance and out the door (and continued to grow as we waited). Kind of a funny set-up as the people waiting just stare at the people who are eating a couple of feet away from them. But I took the line up as a good sign. Who would wait that long for bad food? We ordered the vegetarian plate for 2 and it was more than enough food (and believe me, we were extremely hungry at this point). It was delicious beyond words and came out to around $10 total! I love Nazareth. That is all."}
{"text":"This place has a long line up sometimes one   hour.  It is worth the wait.  The food has fantastic flavor and depth and is plentiful."}
{"text":"Really excited to try ethiopian because i never had it before. The food is extremely delicious though the service is terrible.  My friend and I shared #3, the beef tibs in sauce, with lettuce, tomato and a bit of cheese on the side, $12 tips included. It comes with injera, which is a very spongy flatbread made from teff flour, an ancient grain high in protein. The plate is HUGE! We were stuffed and we still had 1/3 of the dish left. The menu says for 1 or 2 people, but it's plenty for 2. The dish also comes with one injera bread per person on the side. Tangy spicy sauce and warms your stomach. They give you a water jug in which you serve yourself. A couple stores down, there's also an ethiopian restaurant, i'd like to try that next time.  Upside: 1.Tasty food with cultural plates 2. traditional decor and artworks (thought the vines and plants are fake) 3. smells nice of incense  Downside is that: 1.our order took about 25mins to make and we were the first ones in the restaurant.  2. yelp says the restaurant opens at 3pm, it actually opens at 3:30pm 3. the server is never around: Nobody greeted us, we had to yell \"hello?\", we had questions about the menu but she was always in the kitchen, we waited for a long time for her to come out for the bill, when we did come out she quickly went back so you have to be quick to call out 4. we actually ordered 2 dishes, #3 and #6, but since she never repeated the order, we ended up getting #3 only. for the better i guess, since the dish is large. 5. when she doggie bagged the remains, she put the bread at the bottom so when i got home, the bread was all soggy. maybe it's just a personal thing, but i'd like my bread on the side. plus, she didn't add forks :/ 6. the washrooms are dark and a little creepy"}
{"text":"I'm going to start this review by saying: I have no idea why people are lining up to get into Nazareth!  Sure the food is cheap, but that's the best thing that this ethiopian dive-bar has going for it.  It's also slow, prone to error and omission, terribly greasy and not particularly flavorful.   My wife and I went at 6 to beat the rush.  I don't know if the AC was broken or just not up to the task, but it was easily 40C in the restaurant.  Sitting down we got 2 small glasses of water, ordered a spiced tea and a softdrink.  The spiced tea never arrived (we didn't ask again), the soft-drink arrived only after asking for it a second time.  My wife is vegetarian, I'm not.  So we tried to order a veg plate for 2 and a side dish with kitfo on it.  After explaining the dietary restriction situation they seemed to get it; however, what arrived was 2 large platters: one with my kitfo, the other with a veg platter for 1. *sigh*... Oh well, not worth  complaining and waiting for them to get it right.  We dig in.  The kitfo was... well bland and completely uninteresting, and dripping with oil.  The veg plate wasn't much better.  Even the injera wasn't what I'd call \"good\".  In terms of food quality and price: this place is about on par with Queen of Sheba just west of Dovercourt (and rarely with a line) and significantly poorer than many of the great Ethiopian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I love this place!   The food is amazing, Naz is so vibrant and engaging, and the vibe is so inviting. It's equal parts bar and restaurant. The wait is absolutely worth it!  A monthly visit has become a must."}
{"text":"The middle-aged server with curly hair is kind of rude and that's why I never enjoyed my experience there.  A couple times she talked to me badly and last night, after the man at the door told us to sit anywhere, she came to us later on and rudely said we had to get up because someone was going to sit there (and we saw no one). The way she talks is so offensive my friends decided we should just leave. I think I'm going to try other ethiopian restaurants from now on."}
{"text":"Finally went here last night after seeing the line up several times before. This time there was only one group in front of us and there were several tables available! We came RIGHT at 6, maybe actually 5:57, and seriously 3 minutes later there was a really big line, so getting here early is a must.   The food was good (vegetarian platter, $10 for two people + leftovers) however we asked for hot sauce on the side, and I'm pretty sure it was just dumped on top, the food got to be TOO spicy for me, so if you like spice this place is for you!! If you don't, MAKE SURE to tell them no spice on top (although I did tell them this and there was still hot sauce on top).... anyway just be aware of this if you can't handle spicy food. The beer was good too, less than $4 for a pint of steamwhistle and it came in really cold glasses."}
{"text":"I've been here both on weekday and weekend nights for dinner. It usually about a 20 minute wait if you come around 6.30pm. Sometimes there is no staff to be seen when you walk in and its a bit confusing. It is a small place with lots of fake foliage decor (im just imagining the dust collected on them), for some reason an kindergarden animal poster in the front and 2 tv playing cp24. As said before service can be quite hit or miss here and sometimes quite slow.  Getting past the odd decor of the place, the food here is great! Got the Gored Gored last time - the sauce was flavourful, savoury and a bit spicy and it was meaty there were bones in the meat though, while the Tibs option has meat without bones. The salad and cheese it comes with really balances everything out. It comes on a large spongey bread and they also give a complimentary extra smaller bread on the side. It is so fun to eat with your hands on a communal plate. The portions are large I could share one with a friend and still leave full for a very (very) cost, its only $7-$10 per person!  I do wish they gave hand wipes at the end!"}
{"text":"This place is good AND cheap, but don't expect the greatest service. Nothing against the staff, there just aren't enough people working.  We were exploring the neighborhood of \"Bloordale\" and just happened upon a place that looked welcoming and popular. Crowded with hipsters, we figured Nazareth was worth a shot. We walked in and found two seats at the bar (good move, we would have waited a while for them to clear off a table and seat us).  Despite the lack of welcome, we stayed and read the Yelp reviews (warning us of the slow service).   The food is delicious though. And Cheap! We ordered the lamb tibs to share and it was 9 bucks and came with greek salad! The lamb was tender and succulent.  Someone else pointed out that you can get two beers and a dinner for $15. That's pretty accurate. The two of us split the one entree and it was more than enough. The waitress even offered to wrap it for us!  My only negative isn't the service, but more the speed. We had read the reviews and were prepared. Just as long as you know it'll take a while, order a beer (or two) and enjoy the delicious food."}
{"text":"Suuper cheap, yet suuuper filling. Shonna and I came here an hour or so before close so the waiting time was not as long as we had anticipated (only a 10-15 minute wait). Because of the service and the wait time for our food/bill I'm giving this joint a 3/5; we always had to wave our servers down and they did not provide much information in terms of explaining or recommending dishes. Despite Kuruperan's recommendation of getting the veggie platter, we ordered the minced beef platter. It tasted exactly like tacos (but more spiced). The chicken platter comes with actual chicken drumsticks (bones and all). Yes, they do use their hands here so it is going to be quite messy. One order (a large platter) can serve 2 people and it comes up to $13 (with tax but not with tip). When we go back for redemption, and after thorough research, we will be ordering the tibs dish."}
{"text":"*You go there when you're not hungry because by the time you get your food you will be starving. * ... trust me.   We shared the Vegetarian dish and it was amazing, almost life changing! I would definitely go back for seconds, the flavors were a perfect balance of spices and heat. It's the kinda of dish you NEED to share with a friend or else you're going home with a take out box. I also liked the fact that we had to eat with our hands, I had no shame with how messy I was getting. (So make sure you're hands are clean or go wash them in their dark dungeon of a washroom)     P.s CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Yummy! Like everyone is saying, vegetarian platter is surprisingly better than the meats. But the meat (we got the Beef Tibs) are stewed and so flavourful. I say get a combo of both. The restaurant is tiny, however, and lineups can get crazy. The place is also very dark and I like to see what I'm eating."}
{"text":"I will add more to this later.  Went for lunch on Labour Day Monday. It's very dark inside, so that did throw me off a bit. But damn, if the food here isn't fantastic. It's my first ethiopian restaurant in Toronto,  but of all I've ever had, it's the tops. Service is their greatest downfall. Another reviewer stated it, and it's unfortunately true - there is some clear 'visible minority' service discrimination. Our order was taken last out 5 tables, when we were the 2nd table to come in.  Go for the food and cheap prices, not the service.  Will add more details later  ******  Update Jan 2012 - will NOT go back here! I have been to two other Ethiopian spots since and had WONDERFUL service at  African Palace and at another nearby who's name escapes me at the moment (yes I need to write them reviews). I can say I have never felt so welcome, relaxed and at home at any restaurant as I did in those two places. Honestly, we felt like and were treated like VIP's! A nice change for once in a black person's life (yes I'm black, and race as an issue is real in every facet of my life). I went back to Nazareth (not my choice) twice more, and experienced the same AWFUL service. The third time we went, we were so blatantly ignored, passed over for newer lighter skinned customers we just left. I have give them 3 stars before, but I have had to reduce to one. Its really hard to be discriminated against at a business one time, much less three times. Worse when its someone who is also a black+female minority, and goes through the same thing! Is there a way to give zero stars?  Bang for the Buck? Hell yes, food is plentiful, delicious (although she is very stingy on the injera), and cheap.  Will I go back? Hell NO! I do believe this is my first official boycott of a restaurant. I will not recommend it to any, nor bring anyone there. Being a non-local culture restaurant you want to show the best light of your country/culture/people. She does NOT do this at all. Go to ANY other Ethiopian restaurant."}
{"text":"I could easily eat here once a week, maybe more. The veggie platter is my favorite among the Ethiopian places in the area. Plus you really can't beat dinner for two with drinks for under $15."}
{"text":"My first time having Ethiopian and it was delicious. Service was more hands off than I like it, but we got drinks fast enough and our order in decent time. Our waitress came back once for a refill on bread but never asked about more drinks. This is generally a problem for me but given how fast we got our food and how delicious it was, it offsets it a bit.  I'm a big fan of getting large meals and sharing with the whole group, and this style of food perfectly suited for that, to the point that it's on the menu as such!  They only take cash, which I never carry, but there's an ATM in the restaurant and a bank across the street.  Kind of crappy selection if beer, which is just your standard handful of \"Canadian/Specialty/Import\" styles. Not surprised about this, but any small business carrying local craft beers always get extra points from me!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great vibes and atmosphere! You can't beat the prices! I love this place :D"}
{"text":"There aren't many Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto, a few but not enough to make everyone quite familiar with the cuisine. Here, Nazareth nestles itself in perfectly as an introduction to the tradition of shared platters, delicious flavours and healthy variety for vegetarians and omnivores alike.   The food was the highlight of the restaurant, it was delicious(4 Stars); incredibly spicy and a little greasy. As for the restaurant, it was pretty badly managed at the time of night, the weakest link being the young waitress with short hair. She was terrible, and also discriminatory, as her attitude changed drastically while serving the visible 'minorities' throughout the restaurant(0 stars). It's a pity because the owner was incredibly hospitable and warm.   Fire the crappy waitress and I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem on Bloor. I was walking not thinking to come in because it was dark. But my friend insisted I check it out. After seeing the good reviews with the cheap prices, I thought it was one of the best options. I walked in and thought now it makes sense that this place is full at 5:45 PM. It just kept getting better and better. Nowhere had I seen Guiness for $4.45 or Alexander Keith for $3.33. I ordered a glass of white for $4.45 and it was good. My friend and I shared a variety vegetarian plate for $10. I thought I needed more bread at first considering how hungry I was. The portion was huge so ordering another serving of bread wasn't needed. Not only are the prices and portions good, the food was very tasty. I'm not a big fan of the bread. Tastes like plain crepes but it's more of a cultural thing. I highly recommend it. It's small but good place for first dates or lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing. As good as eating in a garden in Addis. Delicious every time, so filling, so cheap, so authentic it hurts. MUST TRY even for those who have not yet tried Ethiopian food. It doesn't get better than this.  Be prepared to wait for a table, and just be patient. It's worth it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   I went with friends, and the four of us had the beef tibs, gored gored, and vegetarian platter.  The BEEF TIBS were just a bit spicy and super tasty, the highlight of the dinner.   I went outside my comfort zone by trying my friend's favourite, the GORED GORED(saucy raw beef!); I thought it was good, but found the texture of raw meat a bit chewy--I think I prefer my meat cooked, but that's a personal opinion and not a slight to Nazereth.  The vegetarian platter wasn't as good as African Palace's--hence my 0.5 star deduction--but it was massive.   Food was yummy, priced at around $10 a dish, and we had plenty of left overs. You don't get better value than that."}
{"text":"This place is really overhyped. I went here with high expectations because of Yelp and was sorely disappointed.   The service was terrible. I had to seat myself at the bar after asking the waitress if I could multiple times and getting ignored. Then I had to find my own menu from a table in the corner. The waitress forgot part of my order after telling her twice what I ordered. I found her very rude and rushed as she was the only one working.   The food was okay but I've had better Ethiopian. I also thought their injera was bland and cold. The Ethiopian bakery down the street has way better and tastier injera.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Ethiopian then don't look further. The dishes are always plentiful, fresh, delicious. The prices are always shockingly cheap.   The only downside is it usually takes 1 hour from the time you arrive until the time you get food in front of you, however, don't let this deter you. Take the time and head over here for some great and cheap eats.  If you go with 2 people, get a vegetarian and meat selection.  It's a great combination of flavours, textures and quantity for about $10 bucks each"}
{"text":"Love (the owner), love the food. Veggie platter is a generous portion. This place is full of heart and they have some pretty awesome dance parties later in the night. Love the crowd, love the culture, love the food. Try it. Trust me."}
{"text":"In the twenty years I've been introducing dining padawans to Ethiopian food, I've come to the conclusion your first Ethiopian experience should be style over substance. Hear me out. For a cuisine that, from the get go, seems like a cruel punchline to a cruel joke on the order of a waitress calling your order of \"just water\" the Bobby Sands[1] Blue plate special to the actual appearance (piles of goop) to the method for consumption (eating piles of goop with your hands and an odd pancake substance that triples as your bread, your utensils, and your plate) ... well ... you can see there are more than a few hurdles you need to over come, especially with your \"but I just like to eat lasagna and not the lasagna they make at Francos because they put green peppers in it I don't know why they do that because they say well you can't taste it and I'm like then why put those green peppers in there so can't we just drive across town and have lasagna at Trevi's where I know they don't put green peppers in their sauce?\" friends.  And, seriously, if your French Canadian grandmother slapped some of this stuff down in front of you in a green plastic bowl with some toasted Wonder Bread, you wouldn't touch the stuff.   So. Presentation is key. Detroit's Greektown had the perfect Ethiopian place The Blue Nile. Alas, like money, the Catholic church, and the middle class, The Blue Nile has fled Detroit for the burbs (http://www.bluenilemi.com/bluenile/7/content.htm). No more jumping the tunnel bus and then the people mover to Trapper's Alley for a friend's first intro to great Ethiopian slop in a clean, pristine environment. And the women's washroom was legendary. Having boy parts, I never did get a look but every woman I ever took came back stunned and babbling. I could never get a clear explanation.  Toronto's best starter Ethiopian restaurant, for me, has been Ethiopian House http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ethiopian-house-restaurant-toronto . Good central location, nicely appointed inside. The food I know is no comparison to the more decor-challenged places in the Bloor/Ossington area. But like I say, get them comfy and then get them to Bloor/Ossington for another foray.  I decided to break my usual pattern with my coworker \"Chris\", his GF, and CUTE! Chinese Girl. \"Chris\" had a really rough week at work (sucks when your dad is the boss) and I promised him I'd buy him Ethiopian food on Friday. \"Chris\" despite his tender years is a pretty good foodie. I wasn't so sure about CUTE! Chinese Girl as she's never, ever, ever enjoyed any restaurant I've ever suggested but she might be homeless in a couple weeks and needs my couch and condo locker as a Plan B so she knew she had no leverage in this matter.  \"Chris\" gf was staying meatless this Good Friday and she seemed game.  The stars were aligning nicely.  Based on Yelp research, Nazareth (a town historians aren't even sure existed at the time Jesus was supposed to be born there) Nazareth seemed like a good choice. Honestly, check out that photo of the veggie platter. That's presentation right there.   I have to say, the Ossington Ethiopian district has stepped up their game since the 1990s. There were some pretty dingy places (although the food was always top notch). I remember one joint where a couple car seats (yes car seats)  were arranged around a mesob. Not a first date restaurant by anyone's stretch.  Decor wise Nazareth also knocks it out of the park. Flavor wise. OMFG. I also like the napkin and wet nap bar.   Nazareth is a small and busy place. Be prepared to wait a long time for a table. Be prepared to wait a long time for your food. Getting a table can be a little unclear and chaotic. But after you take your seats, they know their stuff. Although getting the bill can be another odd wait. People are hovering nearby waiting for your table. You don't want to be one of THOSE diners that seem to linger over long at the table. Trying to be considerate, I asked for the bill right after my dining companions issued their final groans of \"full... so good\". Yes, even CUTE! Chinese Girl pronounced it the best food she's ever had in Toronto (with me). However, it took about another 15 minutes before the waitress managed to get the bill to the table.   _________  [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Sands"}
{"text":"Yum. A friend and I shared the vegetarian platter and it was very flavourful. The decor inside was nice, and it was very trendy too. It was really busy even for a wednesday evening. We had to wait about 15 minutes when we arrived at 8pm. The service was pretty slow and the wait staff was a little rude. The water didn't get filled for a long time. But the food and the price makes up for it!"}
{"text":"After so many years of wondering about Ethiopian cuisine, I finally had the opportunity to try it. Bringing along a guide, originally from Africa to explain the cuisine  and the proper way to eat.  It was a great experience. I had no idea food would be eaten with our hands! Using teff bread - cereal grain native to Northeastern Africa and Southwestern Arabia - you use it to scoop up the goodies.    It is quite an enjoyable experience that you have to try at least once in your life.  Although, teff is naturally gluten free, I was told to be careful about that thought. Apparently, there is a tendency to use wheat in the composition so if you are at a restaurant, ask and if you are buying it ready made check the ingredient list to make sure.  The food was inexpensive, good portion sizes and spicy. I had no idea the food would have such heat. I will say it isn't overly spicy. Its manageable even for those who maybe not enjoy the burn.  Food  is served on a GINORMOUS sharing platter. I will agree with everyone in saying the vegetarian tibs and beef tibs were flavourful.  Overall the food was good but I discovered that the way it was made was on the runny side which is atypical of the cuisine.  Word of warning: be prepared to wait.   The space is small, so the tough part about eating there is you always have eyes on you while you eat. Folks are lined up against the wall where adjacent to you waiting for you to finish. So, it makes relaxing extremely difficult.  Overall, a great first time! Makes me want to try other places and other regions of Africa."}
{"text":"Two can dine for $9.99? Yes please!  Actually it's $10 but that doesn't rhyme.  Anyway...everything everyone says about this place is true: expect line-ups and indifferent service. But the space is a tiny, cozy, plant-laden room and the veggie platter ($10) feeds two and is super-yummy with a nice amount of heat. The moist, spongey bread used for scooping up the lentils, etc, is extremely unique if you've never had Ethiopian before...it's tasty!  My dining companion says the platters at Ethiopia House have more varied flavours, but she concluded that it's a toss-up over which restaurant is better. We both enjoyed our meal at Nazareth and would return."}
{"text":"Really mentally and physically prepare yourself for a wait. I've waited up to 45 mins before. And I keep going back! I think it's worth the wait because I'm cheap and their beef tibs are damn good.   I find that it doesn't really matter what time I show up at the restaurant, I have to wait at least 15 minutes. Once in a while, you get lucky and get a table right away.  Do not expect to be greeted at the door. Don't bother trying to get the Nazareth's (owner) attention. She knows the business she's running. Just stay in line.   The beef tibs are amazing. So juicy and flavourful. I can't stop ripping the injera to pick up the meat when I have Nazareth's tibs in front of me. The injera soaks it up real good. And of course, only $7.99!   The veggie is decent. There is always at least one out of of the six kinds of veggie that is burnt. But for the price of $7.99, it's all good with me. Remember, one order of veggie is enough for two people.   Only when I'm out with two other people will we order TWO things.   The service is slow. The owner is the only server. She makes up for the slowness with her charm, though. Go a few times and she remembers you and knows what you want to order before you open your mouth."}
{"text":"I don;t really get the appeal. I feel there are much better ethiopian restaurants in Toronto especially for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying enticingly aromatic and mouth pleasing spicy vegetarian plates for years at Nazareth. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and tables are always full. Unfortunately, after my most recent experience I don't think I'll be coming back for a while. The service at Nazareth left my self and my partner waiting almost 25 minutes for a beer and 50 minutes before we got our plate of food. If this was another resturant we would have left as very slow service realy is not acceptable. At Nazareth past experiences have also been slow but this was by far the worst. They are under staffed and it shows."}
{"text":"You need to know 3 things for eating at Nazareth: 1) The food is fantastic.  Some of the best Ethiopian food I've had, and better than any other Ethiopian food I've had in Toronto. 2) The food is very cheap.  The veggie combo (which is what you should order) will serve 2 people for just over $10. 3) It will take forever.  You will slightly annoyed at the speed with which you are seated, your order is taken, and when your food comes out.  Just when the \"hangry\" feelings start to peak, your food will come, and all will be forgiven.  The staff all mean well, and the owner can be super friendly and sweet, they're just overwhelmed.  There's honestly not too much more to say about this place.  Great food, great price, annoying process.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"So, we braved the line-up (waited about 30 minutes during dinner time) and the 4 of us split 1 veggie platter and 1 platter of... some kind of meat... it was good, but one of us order the meat dish, forgot what it was and none of us could tell/remember what it was.  Seriously - 2 platters can feed two people - our food bill was under $25.  And even to a hardcore carnivore - the veggie platter is the platter to get.  There's just much more variety.  And in my opinion, this is better than African Palace down the street.  So yes - if you have time to line up, I would recommend Nazareth over African Palace -- even though the folks at African Palace are really nice."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eating at Nazareth! Our server was sooo nice and the food was cheap, plentiful, and delicious! Had plenty left over for lunch on the way back to the States and of course as many folks know Ethiopian is even yummier the next day!"}
{"text":"I came here this last summer with a friend for the first time and fell in love. Not only is everything essentially dirt cheap in price, but the food itself is AMAZING. One dish will fill 2 people up, and their vegetarian dish still brings me into a solid daydream of when I will come back.   Our server was friendly, the place itself is cute, and the food is nothing short of wonderful, filling, and at an excellent price. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week. We love Naz who runs the restaurant. The veggie platter is absolutely delicious - I've tried other Ethiopian restaurants and Nazareth beats them by a million miles. Yes, sometimes you have to wait for what feels like forever in line and for your meal, but that's part of the fun of Nazareth. Soak in the random tropical vibes, drink a couple of beers, have some good times with friends and when the food arrives, it'll taste so damn good you won't care how long you had to wait. At the end of the day, you can't complain when a meal for two costs $10.00."}
{"text":"Never had Ethiopian food, so thought I'd try. The food was excellent. Will definitely have more Ethiopian.  The restaurant is a small cozy family owned place that seems like it's always packed.  Had a good experience overall, but there were a few issues we had.  First, one star lost because it's cash only. There can be all the reason in the world for a restaurant owner to have a cash only policy, but as the customer, it's incredibly inconvenient.  The fact that I had to run across the street to a bank to pay for my food makes this place less than a 5-star review.  Secondly, two star lost because of the service. We came in and probably stood at the door for probably 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Different serves walked by us, and we were practically ignored. Finally, we were seated and our order taken, but it would be another 45 minutes before a different waitress came by and asked us what we would like to order. Apparently our initial order was not actually placed.  Finally, another 10 minutes later, our food finally came.  Overall, Ethiopian food is good. Service was not."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and only because I can't seem to find the time to go there! There's a line out the door if you go during dinner service because there is limited seating.   You can feed 2-3 people for $10 - that's unheard of! I recommend the veggie platter. I tried the meat and wasn't a fan of eating it off the bone as it's already quite messy."}
{"text":"Awesome food, incredible prices can't really complain. The service isn't fantastic but what do you expect for $5-10 a person? The mango juice is delicious and a great compliment to the veggie plate or lamb tibs (or both if you're feeling adventurous). Getting a table is a pain in the ass because of limited space but takeout is always a great option. If you can, I recommend going right after they open (between 3-4) on a Monday, Wednesday or Thursday to get a table without a hassle and for the freshest injera you've ever had in your life. Definitely the best Ethiopian in the city."}
{"text":"All the rave about Ethiopian food here has finally driven my family and myself here. Courtesy of my sister, I find myself seated at a high table in a very crowded and very tight restaurant. Nazareth Bar...as the sign suggests is hardly big enough to count as a bar, but that's just a small detail.   Service here is a far stretch from efficient. Good luck finding the waitress. I have reason to believe the kitchen runs in stack mode I.e. It's last in, first out. Tables arriving later have dishes arriving earlier than our table. Don't ask where your food is, the waitress made it sound like we didn't know we had to wait.  Oh right, tables arriving later, you're expecting to oust people out of their original tables, provided you get a table.   Lack of air con, second rate service, and a terribly difficult to see and move atmosphere really is a turn off.   So, given a terrible first impression, why is it that the restaurant is entirely packed to the rafters? Well, when I say packed to the rafters, I mean more than 20 people.  To be honest, I'm not sure. The food is pretty standard. It's nothing special. Its seemingly overrated. I've read some of the reviews posted here, and needless to say I'm not impressed by the food at all. I won't go to say it is terrible food, but it's not worthy if such high praise.  Ethiopian vegetarian food is a collection of pasty vegetables (I.e...beans, yam, chopped onion, and other carb-heavy veggies). The beef tibs was quite nice, but again, it's nothing special at all.   So, rave reviews are worth it? Not in the slightest. It's passable at its worst, and passable also at its best. Is it worth coming? Come once. Try it out. Be your own judge."}
{"text":"Fifteen dollars doesn't buy you much nowadays.    Robotic penguins in Chinatown.  Five subway tokens.  Two extra value meals perhaps....  But at Nazareth it buys you dinner for two AND two bottles of beer.  I think that's noteworthy enough to recommend this place.    The food is quite good and the ambience is always busy and sorta-hipster.      One woman seems to do everything here.  She cooks.  She cleans.  She serves.  She has so-so conversational skills.  It's quite ok."}
{"text":"Delicious veggie platter.  The lentils have so much flavour.  The food taste and value is best compared to other Ethiopian restaurants I've tried.  Loss of one star because the service was so extremely slow.  Cash only.  The place can have pretty big line ups because it's that good."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in all of Toronto in my opinion. The food is just absolutely amazing, the portion sizes are huge, the price is great. I have waited 2 hours before for this and it was still worth it. The food is consistently amazing. The flavour is delicious. I hope this place never closes down."}
{"text":"Nazareth serves the best Ethiopian food I have ever had -- better than the excellent Habesha on Rideau East in Ottawa, better than venerable Blue Nile in Montreal, better even than the several places I've tried in the U Street corridor in D.C. Arrive by 6 or 6:30 (even on a Monday night) to avoid the line; if you don't, there are a couple other Ethiopian places in close proximity.   You can expect the standard giant plate of different dishes on top of injera. Nazareth made some unusual and welcome tweaks to this trusty formula, like generous piles of crumbled feta cheese and an injera base that flared out at the sides, leaving more of it drier and grippable. The veggie plate options were legume-heavy and came in more varieties than usual; a pile of spicy, crunchy kale was a standout. Enough lamb chunks in the tibs to leave two ravenous dudes extremely full.   You might be too hungry to wait in line for this very special food, but keep trying and you will surely make it in one day as I did."}
{"text":"Key Feature: $12.00 to feed two people.  And it's delicious.  The downside is that there is no secret to how goo this restaurant is.  Everyone in the city seems to be aware of the food, and the value, here.  If you want to eat at Nazareth, be prepared to line for for at least thirty minutes before you get in.  Once inside, you'll notice the vines crawling around the juxtaposing neon beer sign - glowing in the darkened interior.  The food is inexpensive, and the waitresses will be sure to let you know if you're ordering too much.  At first you might be upset that they're recommending you stop ordering, thinking this is somehow a trap.  And then - you get your meal delivered, and you realize that they would have been setting you up to fail if they let you keep going.  Order the meat, order the vegetarian, it doesn't matter.  The food is fantastic, and the prices are hard to beat."}
{"text":"Will be straight to the point here, while the food is delicious (it really really is) almost every other aspect of this restaurant is poor, namely the service.  Also, make sure to not forget anything there. I had forgot a sweater, and when I went back the next day to pick it up, I was informed that they took it home and its theirs now (?). Great.   Can't stress enough the quality of the food, though you may be able to fly to Ethiopia and get some from the source before it comes out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Despite the many people telling me I had to go try Ethiopian food, I kept avoiding it due to the lack of cutlery - the idea of eating an entire meal with only my hands really wigged me.  However, my sister insisted she take me here for my birthday, and so off we went.  We went on a Monday night and got there pretty early, probably around 5:30pm, and were able to get a table right away.  I was shocked to see that after only 20 minutes or so there was a lineup out the door!  She tells me you can wait a loooong time if you come on a Friday or Saturday night, be warned!    It's a great atmosphere, super tiny with a great looking bar and the decor was pretty ace.  Fake vines fill the whole place and lots of interesting art, fairly dim lighting which was nice because I feel like I must have looked like a cavewoman eating here.  My sister said she orders the vegetarian platter every time which suited me just fine as I'm a veg!  I ordered a glass of house white wine and water (it was crazy hot in there) the drinks took a while to come, but the server seemed to be the only one working so that may have been part of it.  The aroma hits you as soon as you go in and I was getting pretty excited to see what the meal would be all about.  Despite the slow drinks the meal came not too long after, and it looked sloppy, but delicious.  We had a large platter that essentially was just piles of veggies lined up with the injera bread beside, and each of us got our own piece of injera as well.  My sis had tried to describe injera to me but I really had no idea what to expect.  I assumed it would be a little more pita-like to make it easy for scooping the food up, but it's more like a crepe - very floppy and spongy.  This means you more or less have to use it to pinch up the food in your fingers and somehow get it in your mouth.  I felt like a monkey and was a little embarrassed but after a few scoops I couldn't stop.  I'm still not entirely sure what we ate, but the flavours of everything were tremendous.  It's impossible to not end up mixing the different types of food but everything works very well together.  The injera has a sourdough flavour but you don't really notice it unless you're eating it on its own, I found.  It's texture soaked up the flavours and spices perfectly, so each bite is super tasty and different.  The veggies ranged from spinach, chunks of potato, beans, lentils, and probably loads of other things I didn't even notice... the best way I can think to describe it is like a deconstructed stew.  They give you some iceberg lettuce and diced tomato alongside the veggies which is nice since everything is more or less sauteed or pureed so it all ends up being fairly mushy and warm so to have something cooler and crunchy to add some texture was great.  We had to order one extra piece of injera to finish it all off, but all in all our bill was $16 and we were stuffed - I think I've paid more for a coffee at Starbucks than for this dinner for two, so I was super impressed with that.   If you're open to try something a little different and don't mind getting a little messy, this place is a must-try!  I've heard amazing things about M&B Yummy in Parkdale so I think I'll try that next to see how it compares."}
{"text":"the dining area fits about 20 people. it is decorated with random illustrations and photographs of lovely ethiopian ladies along with artificial vines that climb everywhere. the overall vibe is laid back and relaxed. expect a long line up but if you want to avoid the long line up, come early (like 4pm) or come late (like 9pm). also if your party is not all present, you will not be seated.  three of us ordered Vegetarian Tibs ($10) and Beef Tibs ($12). it was served on a ginormous plate covered in injera bread. the beef was tender and soaked in delicious spicy sauce that is full of flavour. very bold and strong. for those with weak stomach, you better brace yourselves. the vegetarian tibs was the perfect combo with the spicy beef tibs. i think it was potato, yams, beans, some leafy stuff, butternut squash... i think. i cannot be 100% sure. they were just heavenly mush.  the best way to enjoy this savoury dish is to be creative and use your fingers. no, you will not find forks or knives here, nor should you ask for them. it was liberating and exciting to peel that spongy bread with bare hands, go crazy and dip away in tibs. though my fingers smelled like food for the rest of the day, i had so much fun.  i believe the prices have gone up since they renovated some time ago. i remember people telling me most dishes were under $10. nevertheless, nazareth lived up to its expectation. we had so much food leftover which i took home and ate it the next day for lunch (and still had more leftovers). when your tummy is full with amazing food and your fingertips smell scrumptious, all is good. all is gooooood."}
{"text":"This is going to be my first review (I pretty much signed up for Yelp because of my terrible experience at Nazareth)  I went to Nazareth just last Friday. I got to the restaurant around 8pm... When I arrived to the place there was 2 couples in front of me. I didn't see any worker until 15 minutes.   After the 2 couples sat down, I noticed that there was a table for 2 that was checking out and I asked the worker whether if I was going to sit there... SHE WALKED AWAY & IGNORED ME. I was flustered cause I asked her twice already. I was already irritated so I just sat there waiting for my friend to arrive.  After my friend and I sat down, the worker didn't even notice we sat down (after we asked for the menu).   So we ordered food and I specifically ordered WHITE wine and she brings me RED wine. I was going to say something but I honestly didn't even want to argue with her.   I will say this, our food tasted AMAZING (dirt cheap and large portions but words cannot describe how terrible the service was.   There was only 2 workers and both of them were so oblivious to what was happening. I swear I could do a better job than them!   I'm not too sure if I would ever come back to this place."}
{"text":"I really love ethiopian food, and I eat it a lot. That doesn't mean I'm an expert, or that I know what it \"should\" taste like, only what I like.  We wanted to try Toronto's ethiopian food and we went here because of the reviews on yelp. It closed relatively early, places here in DC don't really get started until midnight and clearly served a non-ethiopian clientel - the menu had the meat, but not the style of cooking on it.  We ordered kitfo - we asked and received it raw, even though it isn't on the menu that way, and the vegetarian sampler.   The Kitfo was a huge portion, not the most buttery delicious and a bit tough in places, but pretty good. It was slightly spicy with green peppers. It also came with cheese, which is always nice.   The vegetarian sampler was a TON of food, but all of the different dishes were served so close together that you couldn't really discern them and pretty soon it turned into a big mess. It was pretty tasty, but not easily identifiable as any of the vegetarian dishes that we have come to love.   The waitress was friendly, though very busy.   It was a huge amount of food, really we could have had just the vegetarian sampler and been totally fine even though we hadn't eaten all day, and very cheap. It was pretty tasty, just not exactly what I'd expect.   It wouldn't have me saying that I'm done searching for other ethiopian places, but on value alone it would be part of my rotation if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"We first discovered Nazareth a few summers ago and I keep thinking about the food from time to time.... can't stay away for too long.  Come here for: - delicious Ethiopian food in enormous portions - an inexpensive meal that's great for sharing - cheap alcohol, a chill crowd  Be warned: - cash only - slow service, wait times during peak hours - no utensils, messy"}
{"text":"Came here one September evening with a few friends. The restaurant recently bought out the store next door and widened, but were still waiting for the liquor license on the other half . Therefore, my boyfriend was only allowed to drink his Corona on ONE side of the room ...  The injera here is fresh and a little tangier than I'm used to.  The collard greens were good but the spices in the lentils were too watered down. For the price ($9 for two people), it's a steal and you can stuff yourself easily, but when you've been spoilt at Ethiopian House, it's hard to say that I was really pleased with my meal.   Not likely to come back unless I'm conveniently in the area and am short on money."}
{"text":"Bring an appetite to this place because the portions are massive!   It's also extremely well priced (food & liquor), which undoubtedly contributes to the lineups.  We went on Sunday evening at 7.30 and it was a full house and there was a lineup at 8.30 when we left. There's nothing to complain about on the food at this place -- it's competently executed, though I've had better at Nunu (more expensive) and Zagol (not sure if it's still around). As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, it does have a sort of shipwreck vibe -- 3 tvs broadcasting sports, ethiopian news and animal tricks, julio iglesias covers elvis and the beatles in the background -- which contributes to a wacky atomosphere, washroom lights that sporadically flash on and off -- which clearly isn't at all about fine dining. But my kids liked it too and were well treated. I'd have liked a meat sampler to complement the vegetable platter, but that's pretty minor -- the beef tibs alone were very good!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the amount of food you get for the price is amazing.  My usual dishes are the veggie platter and beef tibs. You need to share with a friend, as the portion is a lot.  Ethiopian food is like crack to me. I eat it and I crave like crazy for weeks after.  This is a good place to get that fix.  The only issues are that there is always a line and the service is pretty awful (rude server, long wait times for food, also I have tried to order the special tea on numerous occasions but they never have it... I wonder if it's too much of a pain in the ass for them to make).  But the food is delicious and addictive, despite the horrible service I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Here is an update about the wait times at Nazareth. Every order is prepared FRESH, you will hear them chopping in the back after every order. Getting a freshly prepared Veg Platter for $10 is worth the wait. So get here knowing that you will have to wait in line and for the food. along with their Veg platter; I love the Tibs platter for $12 too. If you get there around 5, you will get a table on most days."}
{"text":"Best food for literally the best value! One dish is enough for 2/3 people and it literally costs $5.99 no joke! MUST GO. Gotta be one of the best restaurants in town!"}
{"text":"Food is good for the price. To pay $10 after tax for two people to stuff their faces is pretty good value by my standards, especially if there are vegetables included. Although they are a bit stingy with the injera so if you're not used to this style of food you will run out of it VERY quickly.  Outside of that, the service is really terrible. We waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged and 45 minutes for our food. At one point all of the tables were occupied and all but one was waiting for food to arrive. Also, the server wiped down our table with what had to be the stinkiest rag I had ever smelled in my life.   Cash only is also really annoying."}
{"text":"For all the years i've been coming here - no other Ethiopian restaurants have compared as of yet.   They keep doing a great job in a divey kind of way."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait - wait to be seated, wait for your food, wait for your bill.  My friends and I have come to accept this as part of the Nazareth experience, yet the food is so good that we are able to forgive those short-comings.  Hands down, my favourite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have yet to find anywhere else in Canada where 2 people can eat such delicious food for $10 + tip. The veggie platter really is great, and it's plenty of food for 2 people. Yes, there is always a line up, but it moves pretty quickly. Yes, the staff aren't the most attentive, but they're nice enough if you're nice to them. It's not somewhere I'd go to spend the whole evening, but I'd recommend anyone who's on this side of town pop in for dinner one night."}
{"text":"This is a popular place. It's been long waits (more than 30 mins) both times I've been there.   If you can deal with the wait then you get great food. The veggie platter is delicious and quite the serving. The injera is sufficiently squishy, and you can get extra if needed (but it is a space filler so don't order too much!).   As I had a vegan friend with me the last time he was concerned that they served both the meaty stuff with the veggie dish all on the same platter but the server assured us that both dishes were cooked in different pans and that there was no risk of contamination. My friend was happy with that.   Good food, great value. Long wait."}
{"text":"The quality of your experience at this place is in your hands, which pretty much means they get a \"fail\" on customer service.  But if you want some of the consistently best Ethiopian food in Toronto at the lowest price imaginable, you won't mind navigating around the potholes that most reviewers cite as Nazareth's flaws, i.e. long lines, long wait times, unorganized servers, etc.  1. Go before 5:30.  You'll get seated right away and the lack of line ups makes everyone (especially other patrons) a lot more pleasant to be around.  2. Vegetarian tibs.  Order them.  You don't need to be a vegetarian to forgo the meat option and you will be served so much quicker.  At the very least, avoid ordering the fish at all cost.  I've had an entire meal of vegetable tibs while the table beside me waited on their fish.  3. Place your whole order at once and make it simple.  Unfortunately, this isn't a place you want to gamble with an order that includes a few different types of drinks, separated cheques, or any other complications.  Pro Tip: ordering wine allows you to benefit from their heavy pours.   4. Bring cash.  No debit or credit cards here, and bringing the right amount of cash helps you get in and out the fastest.    When it's all said and done, you'll be paying about $15 tops for a delicious and super filling meal for 2 or 3 people.  Make that $30 if you're ordering drinks."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday around 8, waited 20 minutes, and had the beef tibs. The food was a generous portion and very flavorful!  The place is small, and basically you just have to stand in line and wait for a table to open up.   The service wasn't friendly or fast. The server seemed annoyed. As stated in other reviews, they didn't ask patrons to leave, as one table of  4 sat with one girl with a sip of wine in her glass for the full 20 minutes we were waiting, and then that group was STILL occupying their table for  20 more after we were seated, even with a line up of 6-10 people at the door. It would  have been considerate if those people had been asked to move to the bar or something!  (for both staff and restaurant patrons!)  Don't use a fork here, because it's \"an insult to the culture\". The waitress literally took a fork out of my friend's hand and looked angry. It was a bit disturbing, as some people probably aren't aware of this! If you're going to go that far, put a sign on the wall or something!"}
{"text":"One of the best Ethiopian dinners I've had! I've had Ethiopian food in DC and here in NY, as well as at the home of some Ethiopian friends. Nazareth was as good as the home made food I had! And it's super inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food! However the wait was long, so don't go there too hungry esp with a lot of people or when ordering lots of food. Nonetheless, the food is so good it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently great, and the vegetarian options are wide for Mr. Vegetarian, plus there's plenty of food when it arrives for less than half what comparable places charge. The coffee and tea are also great, and the injera is clearly fresh with that slight tang. While not the most extraordinary food in the world, it's way better and way more of it than anyone could expect at their prices, and always served fast, warm, and with good cheer.   Note: the restaurant itself is often very warm inside. Wear layers, especially in winter, to avoid overheating."}
{"text":"I am going to be completely honest with you when i say this is one of the greatest meals i have ever had before. we had the beef tibs and sea food... they were both terrific in a peppery sauce, the injera (spelling) was .lined with an oil and vinigar salad with a feta like cheese.. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING!!! take the injera and lop up some of the beef tibs with sauce WITH the salad and salty cheese AND YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR DAMN MIND!  BTW.. its a small place, family run, if you can wait 30 mins to eat there is a McDonalds down the road...   This place is for real heads only! 10/10 !!!!"}
{"text":"You simply cannot go wrong here ordering Beef Tibs. I mean, it's so good, slightly spicy with a little sauce. Simply excellent food."}
{"text":"This is one of the most affordable, filling, and delicious Ethiopian food that you can get!!! One platter can easily fill up two people with huge appetites and it's sooooo cheap! I like to get their veggie platter over their meat ones (I had the beef platter) because the veggie platter has a lot more variety/flavour/colour and the beef is just...beef.   I get their gluten free injera because it doesn't give me an upset stomach compared to their \"normal\" injera. I also like that they give you lettuce to use.   One down side is that I find their platters too salty and their veggie dish can be overly oily (although this may be from their salad) compared to other Ethiopian restaurants.   Ambience is really cool and \"earthy\" though the wait time is long as they take awhile to make the platters. The owner, also named Nazareth is very kind and you can tell she's worked hard to make this one of the best Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars just because it is SOOOO ridiculously cheap! I  It's gotta be the cheapest sit-down meal I can think of, plus it's super tasty.   We always get the veggie platter. As mentioned below, 1 veggie platter is big enough to 2 people (really) and costs $8. Tonight 4 of us dined and had 2 veggie platters, and we ended up paying $5 each including tax and tip. Insane!  The veggie platter comes with 6-7 different lentil, spinach, sweet potato and chickpea dishes (1-2 scoops of each). I love it because it's served HOT. A few of the Ethiopian places i've dined at (Lalibela, for example) serve the food luke warm or cold which just is not as tasty.  I have tried some of the meat dishes and they are not as good. However a meat dish paired with a veggie platter can make a decent meal for 2.  As mentioned by others, the place looks slightly sketchy from the outside but it's fine inside - dark and cosy. Expect a line up (everyone loves a bargain!) It's a perfect venue to meet up with friends, squeeze in, share a nice meal and catch up.  I did notice tonight that Nazaret has hired help! There was another woman serving and things seemed to move a bit quicker once we were seated. The food took about 10 minutes to arrive and water was topped up occasionally. The bill came fast too."}
{"text":"I got there around 6:30 and got one of the last tables available. I shared the #7 vegetarian plate with my girlfriend and it was great! Just the right amount of food for both of us (we both have decent appetites) and the spices used in the different options had just the right amount of heat. For the price point, this place can't be beat do long as you enjoy the communal aspect of sharing a plate and eating with your hands."}
{"text":"There's a ton of different Ethiopian restaurants in the city but a friend strongly encouraged to go to this one specifically. It was my first experience so she wanted to take me to the \"best one in the city\". I trusted her expertise so we decided to trek all the way there dispite the distance.  So the idea of this is there are different meat and vegetable stews. You can order the mixed plate of both so you can try all different ones. You also have the option of ordering just one kind, but that's boring right?! We decided to get the sharing platter where you get 4 different kinds of meats and 6 different kinds of veg. . they're all mushed up and the flavours are really aggressive and heavy you can barely tell apart what's what at the end."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. The food is very good and the portion sizes are very generous for the price. However the wait is very long. My most recent experiene was not the best. My friends and I went there to grab a bite but the waiy was so long that we ended up going to African Palace which is a few steps awag from Nazareth. This place is quite understaffed. Plus the AC wasn't working, and during a scorching summer day it's not the most comfortable restaurant to be eating in.  Food's great, service could be improved."}
{"text":"I would give this place minus 100 stars if I could. Most disgusting service ever. If you have lots and lots of time to waste (as in 2-2.5 hours), then by all means, this restaurant is for you.  I was seated at the bar for 30 minutes before I couldn't wait anymore for the waitress to come by. I called for her and asked her for the menu. She pointed to a table with menus and \"there.\" THERE?!!? I got my own menu and Then tried ordering and the waitress looked at me but didn't acknowledge my order. She came back to me after about 10 min to confirm my order. Then I waited just over an hour and asked her how much longer I would have to wait. She gave me a disgusted look and said \"just wait. There are others that ordered before you.\" I then proceeded to wait another 30 min. During all this time, she never even gave me water or asked me if I wanted to have a drink. Then she comes up to me and says \"do you want to move to a table?\" I said \"no thanks.\" And she replies \"no. You need to move. The bar is for drinkers. You just ordered food.\" WTF!!???? You make me wait 2 hours for my food and give the world's sh!ttiest service and tell me to move? It is NOT WORTH IT. Yes, the portions are big for a cheap price but PEOPLE!!! YOUR 2-2.5 HOURS IS WORTH MORE THAN THE $5 YOU SAVE. And they don't even take credit or debit.. Only cash. I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED BY THIS PLACE. I never usually have such hatred for people trying to make ends meet and run their own business but i TRULY HOPE THIS PLACE GETS SHUT DOWN SO WE CAN GET A BETTER RESTAURANT WITH BETTER SERVICE"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here expecting the long wait so we weren't surprised. It took about an hour and half from when we ordered until the food arrived. We got the veggie platter and beef tibs, it was amazing and the portions were huge. We had to take it to go because it was just too much to try to finish.   As everyone has said, service is very slow and not friendly so just keep that in mind when you do decide to come here."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday evening around 6:30pm for dinner and I'm sure glad I did! Didn't have to wait long for a table for two (perhaps 10 minutes). The plate sizes are huge (enough for 2) and all of the platters are one price ($10.61). Excellent value! We had #1, the veggie platter and it was great. We didn't have to wait extremely long for our food. Each item was super flavourful and unique. The bread was interesting. The ambiance is that of a neighbourhood bar, dark and cozy. Overall, you really can't go wrong with the excellent value for their platters, as they are super tasty and affordable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nazareth's food is still excellent.  The vegetarian combo platter is still great: a fresh mix of different dishes. I've also tried the vegetarian tibs which is flavourful and delicious also.  Be aware that service can be slow. On our last visit, we waited over an hour for our food. Meanwhile, the next table who ordered at the same time as us received their food half an hour earlier, so your mileage may vary. Prices are higher than they used to be."}
{"text":"The food was great, everything else was a nightmare. Avoid this restaurant, unless you order the food for take-out!  I never had Ethiopian, so the star rating, the location near the apartment we rented, and the line-up we've seen every day convinced us to try it. We arrived at the restaurant at 8:30pm. Took a good 45 minutes before being seated. There was only two groups of people before us, the staff never came to greet us before it was our turn. Once we sat down, it took another 30 minutes before the waitress came to get our order. By then we were almost ready to leave, but the food looked and smelled so great that we stayed.  We finally got our food around 10pm. We were starving! Luckily the food was great. Unfortunately, the bad service didn't stop there. Half-way done with our plate, we needed more injera (the bread used as an ustensil). We couldn't see a single waitress in the restaurant. It took almost another 20 minutes before we could get additional bread -- 20 long minutes we couldn't eat since there are no forks on the table. By the time we finally got the additional bread, the food was cold and we weren't hungry anymore.  Overall, a very frustrating night. I'm usually very patient and forgiving, especially when the food is good, but for this one, I can't honestly give more than a star."}
{"text":"Food and drink: Favourite restaurant in the city! Vegetarian platter is very flavourful, delicious, hearty, and healthy with a good mix of lentils, veggies and fresh injera. Best value for money too (~$12-14 for a very filling meal for 2 people)  Atmosphere and service: The place is small and homey, with eclectic decor (maybe a little tacky, but it works in this space). Service is friendly but a bit slow given that there is typically only 2 people working both the tables and kitchen. Expect a wait, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice food the vegetarian plate is good for two people  Service is little bit slow but overall food is good and is good to try once"}
{"text":"**I came into Nazareth expecting to wait, and with low expectations about the service (based on past reviews). So I'm factoring this out of the majority of the review (except for the subtraction of two stars; service is important).  When you walk into Nazareth, it feels like you've stumbled into a cross between a grandmother's house and a dive bar. It's small and cozy, with framed family photos on the walls and fake ivy vines winding down from the ceiling, but funky and kitschy - neon and dim lighting. As far as I could tell, the whole restaurant is only run by about three people - cooks included - which makes for a very authentic and intimate experience. On the down side, it also means (like I mentioned at the beginning) you're going to wait a long time for your food. And I mean a really, really long time. We must have waited a good 45 minutes to an hour, at least - so bring someone you enjoy talking to!  We ordered the Veggie Sampler and the Lamb Tibs to share. I had no idea what I was eating, but I can say it was all incredible. The flavors in the veggie dishes were unbelievable, and the lamb was so tender it melted in my mouth. The injera is the perfect sour accompaniment; don't be shy to ask for extra! You'll need it.  Despite the long wait, I was as happy as a clam. Nazareth is definitely the best Ethiopian food I've ever had, and 100% authentic. Come for the food, not the service."}
{"text":"The is an odd 5 star review as I'll start out with the bad.  The service is terrible.  The servers (I believe owners) are cranky, inattentive and generally inhospitable.  It takes a long time to get your food and if you want more bread or another drink you had best do it all when you start.  Order 2 drinks at one time or you will be leaving before you see them.  That said, non of this matters.    The quality of the food is exceptional, I mean amazing.  It is the best Ethiopian I have had outside of Washington for a price that makes no sense at all.  One order is also massive - it can easily feed two people.  The first time we came here we made the mistake of seeing the price and ordering one thing each off the menu.  We took home a weeks worth of food.   So, don't come in a hurry, don't expect good service but do come hungry and with cash (although you don't need much of it).  They don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it opened and I usually love it and accept the unwritten rules that go along with being a patron:  1)It's going to take forever (last time 25 minutes for a beer and 1 hour for food, if you lucky enough not to wait for a seat). Make no plans for after. 2)Eat everything on your plate or take the rest to go. DO NOT waste food!  3) Do not ask for a fork....just don't. It's really good food (the veggie is my favorite). But lately I don't go as often because the waiting is really getting under my skin. And the food just isn't THAT good to warrant almost 2 hours of starving and waiting."}
{"text":"I've been back a few times since my original review, and this place just keeps getting better. It was a friend's birthday last night and Nazareth laid out fun birthday napkins and brought us an app. platter for free. So spicy and delicious. She also lit candles around our tequila shots. This place is a true 5 star delight!"}
{"text":"You just really can't go wrong with Nazareth. I just love this place and from the huge waits every time I go here I'm all to aware that I'm not alone in feeling that way. The service might be a little slow and the wait times pretty long but as soon as that food is put down in front of you, you forget all about all of that and you all just dig in (literally) to some of the best Ethiopian food that you'll ever enjoy and when the bill comes at the end of the night and you realize that four of you were able to enjoy an amazing filling meal with beers for less then $20 each with a tip you'll realize just how awesome Nazareth is. I love Nazareth and you should too"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was quite poor.  To the owner/waitress it seemed like she was doing us a favor by letting us eat.  Took forever to get a drink and 50 minutes to get the platter.  Food was good but I'd go to the Ethiopian place on Church st. before this one again."}
{"text":"Talk about having the worst service ever. I don't care how good the food is but I regret ever considering it after the server gave us the hand telling us we had to wait to place a take out order, this is after we had already waited over 10 min at the bar. After this she comes by telling us that she can't serve us because we didn't call ahead of time. I'm so sorry that we didn't have a PhD on how to eat at your resturant. We just walked in based on a referral and definitely won't ever be coming back. Try African Palace a few doors down. It was welcoming and nice."}
