{"text":"Wing night is Wednesdays. Whole jumbo wings $12.00. Thursday is all you can eat pasta, quite good I must say. Bear burger is is double decker and just as good as everything else I had."}

{"text":"Had some wings in the afternoon before the rush and they were fantastic. Got the hot wings that had sweet jalape√±os mixed with the sauce was a great touch. Definitely bringing my friends here for wings."}
{"text":"Wings really are that good. Really good. 

It's your local blue collar valley dive and the crowd and service are as you'd expect. It has \"character\". The owner told me that his crowd is police and coal miners. Western pa,
Right?

Anyway, go try the wings. They are 5-star. The atmosphere, service and smell of cigarettes are a 1. Avg=3 stars"}
{"text":"Stopped there on Wednesday, Nov. 1 at 4:00 with my daughter. We both wanted wings and Wednesdays are their wing nights so we thought we'd give them a try. We were sitting in their dining room for 15 minutes and not one person came to the dining room to get our drink orders or anything. I kept saying hello hello and finally after another 5 minutes went by some guy came out from the kitchen area and just stood there. I said to that guy is anyone working and that we've been waiting over 15 minutes and nobody came to wait on us. He was kinda rude about it and said someone will be there. You'd think he'd at least apologize and see what we wanted to drink but no . After a couple more minutes went by we ended up leaving. My daughter was cranky because she was thirsty and hungry and before I left my home I checked my sugar and it was only 52. I'm a diabetic and needed to get something in me soon. I was actually shaking a little. We ended up going to Clyde & Patty's and was a much better choice. Got waited on right away and had our food pretty quickly."}
