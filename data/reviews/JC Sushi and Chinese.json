{"text":"Best sushi bar EVER!!! Great prices, better food. Alcohol is super cheap too. 
 Anyone says otherwise is smoking crack like the towel D T."}
{"text":"We have been there multiple times.  Loved it.  Til recently.  We went in and waited over 20 min, without any server coming over to us to assist us.  No drinks, no service nothing.  We sat there waiting....while being passed by multiple employees....after 20 min we got up and left.  That sucks for them.  We spend $80 bucks each time we went in....usually 1 to 2 times a week."}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in LA and my hubby and I have been out here about 4 years.  It's been really hard finding non-franchised Asian cuisine that is quality.  I have to say, my orange chicken lunch special and CA roll were very good.  I had it delivered to work and it was a little cold and the roll wasn't very 'crunchy', but other than that, it was very good.  You could tell it was real fresh chicken and probably hadn't been under a heat lamp for long.  It was soft and tender like it should be.  They also put the sauce on the side so it wasn't swimming in sweetness.  The sauce was lightly sweet and good.  I'll order again and have already let co-workers know."}
{"text":"I was so pleased to see a local sushi bar and chinese restaraunt pop up in my neighborhood, and even more excited to discover that the food there is quite tasty. I had the mandarin tofu, which had just the right amount of heat, with a very fresh presentation of vegetables. The tofu chunks were not over fried, a rare happening, and the fried rice was excellent. My husband had the sweet and sour pork, and while I am not usually a fan, I found the pork to be tender and flavorful, and again, not overcooked. The service was great, and the only mar was that we sat in the vacinity of a very negative couple, clearly something the restaraunt had no control of. I am usually reticent to order sushi, as I am still cultivating an appreciation, but I did on this occasion, and again, found the rice to be tender, and not crumbly and stiff with staleness, as I have had happen a couple of times at other places. There really is a dearth of good restaraunts in my neighborhood, so I was very happy to find this gem; will plan on being a regular."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here 4 times, the food is fantastic and the safe is professional and eager to please. Customer service is great. THE FOOD IS GOOD!!!!!!!! Thank you JC Sushi"}
{"text":"I shouldn't take 30 minutes to make one sushi roll!"}
{"text":"I've always been pleased with JC in the past, but tonight the place had a different feel. The TV screen menus were black and the place was empty at 6:30 PM. I ordered a Tootsie Roll without cucumber and it was tiny and was missing the crunch and eel sauce."}
{"text":"The chinese food was delicious, we had the orange chicken, the sushi was awesome! Very fresh and  beautiful presentation.  The service was good, Will definitely return again , the whole family enjoyed it and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"100% my favorite place for Pho. I've actually never been to the restaurant but order for delivery all the time. Can only imagine it would be even better in person. Their broth is amazing."}
{"text":"We were excited to try out a new sushi place and were extremely disappointed. We ordered 2 California Rolls, a Chicken Tempura Roll, and an order of Veggie Tempura. While the rolls were ok tasting, the Veggie Tempura was a joke. $7.50 for the smallest order of tempura I've ever seen (pic has been posted). It consisted of 2 mushroom slices, 2 pieces of broccoli, 2 tiny slices of onion, and 2 tiny pieces of sweet potato. It's like someone searched for the smallest veggies they could find. A complete rip off. If I had eaten there I would have sent it back which I never do!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and also ordered takeout twice of both sushi & chinese food.  The food is very good and fresh always.  We will continue to visit because the food is delicious but Today was a HUGE disappointment- 3 of us arrived one of which is my 12 year old daughter.  

The girl at the front started to seat us in the bar area and I said not the bar please.  She said oh we have booths on the other side and proceeded to take us around the corner which was still right in the bar area.  I said not the bar area please. She said sorry the dining room is closed. I told her I didnt want my 12 year old in the bar area.  She said Im sorry thats all I have available (the entire dining room was empty 10 feet away). We said ok we'll go somewhere else.  Took our business down the street and are sad at the bad service somewhere we thought was a diamond in the rough we had found at previous visits.  We are not prudes by any means and eat out very often- I just prefer not eating in bar sections with my daughter.  :((("}
{"text":"I don't like to leave bad reviews, but I was so disappointed in this place.  We live nearby, and I was actually advised to check them out.  Got take-out, and the only thing edible was the crab puffs.  The soup was awful, and no amount of doctoring made it better. I can't say that I will give them another try.  $30 wasted."}
{"text":"Amazingly good sushi for strip mall!  Near discount theater at 27th Ave and Bell!  I was so impressed with the variety on the menu and quality of the food.  Also, the Chinese food here was outstanding.  Very reasonable price! Can't wait to go back.  I am tired of paying $11 per sushi roll when I can pay $6 here."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. We ordered the pu pu platter disgusting. The egg rolls were frozen in the middle and tasted weird. The chicken skewers were chewy and like jerky. We also ordered the jalapeño chicken and the chicken was almost inedible. It was also chewy. We each ordered a sushi roll and it was average at best. There are way better places for sushi and Chinese food don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Well, I guess it's good that the giant cockroach that ran across the floor came out before our water was even on the table. DISGUSTING!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken pho meal from this location through UberEATS, and I was not satisfied with my meal. First, the \"chicken\" did not taste like chicken nor did it have the proper texture of cooked chicken. The \"chicken\" looked slimy and it had a fishy odor. Second, the noodles were too tender to chew. The noodles didn't soften up even after they sat in the hot broth for several of minutes. I've ate chicken pho from numerous Vietnamese restaurants and I've never had an unpleasant experience like this before. I wouldn't recommend buying the chicken pho."}
{"text":"We ordered the Mongolian beef which was good but extremely spicy. I love spicy food, but this was pretty over the top. Egg drop soup tasted very \"yolky\". Worst of all my hubby and I couldn't leave the rest room the entire next day. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"I stopped by while waiting to have my car detailed in the area. For sushi, I told the chef what I like and don't like. He created a roll that was perfect for me. Orange Chicken was awesome."}
{"text":"I'm mostly doing this review for their very quick delivery through Yelp Eat24 app. The sushi is not the greatest but is good. They didn't have a Thai Tea option through the app I used but I specified it and they did give it to me so I'm pleased! Delivery came in a lot less time than was estimated!"}
{"text":"Delivery through DoorDash was great. I asked for my Philly rolls \"naruto-style\" (wrapped in cucumber), and received regular rolls. Fine...whatever...I just ate the salmon, cream cheese, and avocado out the middle of the rolls. About 7 hours later, I wake up with food poisoning! I'm never eating here again. 

Also, my husband got chicken and broccoli, and he said that it was flavorless and almost too tender. He only ate a little bit of if because he said he was afraid he would get sick. Of course he is fine, and I'm laid up with sweating, shivers, and GI distress!"}
{"text":"Great sashimi great sushi ... OK Chinese good... sub-par customer service ... bit the food makes up for it, not to many places can say that about! Fresh melting yellow tail beautiful salmon unique rolls traditional feel great great prices for the quality of the food"}
{"text":"Amazing orange chicken and sushi. Portions are a bit lacking but I suppose quality is better than quantity."}
{"text":"Great staff, food and prices. I'm here 4times per week for happy hour
 Their hot sour soup is the best!"}
{"text":"Great food! We have been coming here since it opened and the staff is awesome. You can't beat their happy hour and if you like Rolls get the volcano Roll."}
{"text":"I ordered over $50 worth of sushi for take out. I went in to pick it up and I had a coupon for $5 off. After you spend that much on sushi what is $5 anyways. I go to pay for my order and hand over my coupon and the girl looks at it and looks back at me and then says I will be right back. Come back a minute later and says they won't take my coupon. REALLY $5, after my total coming to $65 and we ordered two 32oz root beers. They are not 32oz in size and the root beer was watered down. Just seems everything about this location is not good. Save your money and avoid coming to this place."}
{"text":"Wow, congratulations! I've been on yelp for years and haven't ever left a review for food..until now. We ordered cream cheese wontons, crunchy California roll, spicy crispy beef steak, General Tso chicken and qualified for the free Las Vegas Roll. Firstly, the cream cheese wontons were cold and beyond stale...I didn't know cream cheese in a fried wonton wrapper could actually be inedible. The crunchy California roll was not crunchy...it was a basic California roll. The crispy beef steak was compared to Beef Jerky and the General Tso chicken was Truly sweet and sour chicken and sauce with some other sauce added in. That Las Vegas roll tasted like canned tuna and the sauce for it....ya...it don't know how that was supposed to compliment anything. We threw away our dinner, and I've never actually done that before...we're are NOT picky eaters. Don't waste your time or $ on this place."}
{"text":"Just ordered lunch for my office (14 lunch specials).  I placed the order online, they called to confirm (which I loved).  When I got there to pick up the food, they had it all ready, each meal marked and they included all the sauces, forks, fortune cookies, etc.  The staff was extremely friendly and even helped me carry the food out to my car.  I will add JC Sushi Bar and Chinese Restaurant to my restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"This was the best sushi and sashimi I have had since leaving Hawai'i. We enjoyed our choices so much that we tried eachother's dish. Too much food; we took it home for another meal. We have decided to make this our go-to for Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch and I'm glad I did!. Lunch portions are huge.I got a shrimp tempura roll and it was delicious. Also loved the orange chicken. Restaurant was really clean. I definitely plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Love their Chinese food and some of their sushi rolls. Great prices. Good customer service. We love coming to this restaurant especially for happy hour"}
{"text":"I am thoroughly confused by the high ratings, but perhaps it's for the Chinese food on the menu. I can only speak for the sushi, which I have now ordered three different times because I kept thinking \"I have to try them again, the ratings are so high, maybe I just got less than perfect rolls this time.\"  But three times is the charm... the sushi is awful. I have tried the Las Vegas Roll, the Baked Scallop Roll, the California Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, and Spicy Tuna Roll.  Every one was mediocre at best, and the Vegas Roll was downright terrible (the tempura was soggy and there was more cream cheese than fish). The baked scallop roll, which is my favorite sushi roll at any Japanese restaurant, tasted terrible. And the cream cheese fried wontons were soggy and soft!  We didn't even touch them. I hate to be so brutal, but with all the wonderful sushi options in the valley, I will never frequent this establishment again. At least I can say I gave it a fair try, with three chances."}
{"text":"Staff was nice but the sushi was terrible and warm, very stingy happy hour menu. I don't know how this has 3 plus stars."}
{"text":"They were very friendly when entering & waitress was super nice. Then the food came.....Salty Salty Wontons...then a bland meal..no flavor. I ordered cashew chicken & my sister had them make up a vegetarian meal without fish sauce. I order fried rice that came on the plate looking like brown rice...had horrible flavor. We both looked at each other after one bite & said \"I can't eat this & after those salty wontons...let's tell them & leave to go somewhere else. The comped our whole meal plus drinks. So friendly staff for sure but I'm here for the food......Which I won't come back for Chinese sorry."}
{"text":"Got 2 California rolls with a miso soup for $8 bucks cant beat that dine in and get 40% off on all sushi rolls"}
{"text":"I've gotten jc sushi through uber eats and I didn't receive one of the rolls I ordered and the roll that I did ordered tasted so bad I felt like the fish they used was tuna fish from a can 10/10 would not recommend or eat there again"}
{"text":"I just love this place. The sushi were great, I had the Boston rolls , and dragon roll it taste delicious.Also they had 40%off on sushi everyday!"}
{"text":"How excited am I a sushi place that delivers! The delivery guy had it on ice! Ordered lunch combos beef and broccoli and Mongolian beef great portion and very flavorful. Crunchy California roll was also tasty."}
{"text":"Food was quick.  Dragon roll and sweet and sour pork was delicious.  Service was awesome, atmosphere was great.  Nice temperature.
We came in about 45 minutes before it closed and our food was done in about 15-20.
Looks a bit sketchy outside but, sooooo worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in here one afternoon for happy hour with my boyfriend and we'd just missed the happy hour time but we figured we'd stay and give it a shot. We were the only people in the bar and that meant we got great service (a little too eager to chat us up.....he seemed a little bored). Food was good but I was sad that they're a beer/wine/sake only place. Overall, I would come back during happy hour pricing but not regular pricing; it gets expensive real quick!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. It took forever for our waiter, any waiter, to take our order or check on us or run our card. They clearly were swamped and needed more competent waiters. Unfortunately, the food didn't make us want to forgive the poor service. It was mediocre at best. We won't bother returning."}
{"text":"This place actually has good food but the service is absolutely awful, the staff is incredibly rude, and they gave me the rudest attitude when my pho came in cold and I asked them to a hot bowl. 
This place would be awesome if the staff didn't treat you like shit."}
{"text":"Sushi is good. A new York type Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"Love this place. Never a bad experience. Super friendly staff and amazing food. Dine in or delivery always satisfied"}
{"text":"Another scary sushi place. Stopped in here awhile ago because their happy hour looked enticing. Alas, it is not.

They didn't have a liquor license when I visited (only beer and wine), so it was a dud for my friend that doesn't like beer. The seem to make sushi in a cobbled together area right inside what was the bar of Native New Yorker. 

Ordered their orange chicken, which came out before my sushi rolls. It was OK, VERY sweet though. Highlight of my experience, for sure. 

Sushi was terrible. First roll I tried was pretty bad; ate about 1/3 of it. Next roll, could have been an ER visit had I eaten any of it. This has been the only time I have ever had to send a plate of sushi back. Spat out a piece as soon as I put it in my mouth. Further examination revealed it was warm and smelled. Yikes.

Had the manager smell it, and he took it off my bill. I couldn't pay fast enough to get out of there. One and done, lesson learned. Drink specials weren't great, no booze and wretched quality of fish."}
{"text":"At one point I used to vouch for this place. Got take out tonight and it was appallingly disgusting. Fried rice was completely dry and stale. No flavor. Pork taste like it had been sitting out all day. I hope I don't get food poisoning. Never returning."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here a few times, food is always hot and fresh and a large quantity, but for the life of me I don't understand how when I ask for EXTRA soy sauce, I end up with 4 packets?!?!??!  LOL Is it just me????  Oh, well, next time I order through Yelp, I will also call the store to make sure they throw in extra packets!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from them several times. I know from experience that some of their menu items are better than others... But today was the last straw. From their list of \"sushi rolls\", I thought I'd try the calamari tempura. What I received was a bowl of mushy calamari rings with the breading coming off that tasted like nothing but grease. (I'm not kidding... not even my dog would eat it. But it cost the price of sushi!) The two-piece eel sushi tasted ok, but was tiny. The rice below the eel was the size of a quarter, and hidden under the sliver of eel. The edamame was mushy and flavorless. The last time we ordered from them, they also sent us the wrong items, but at least they were mediocre quality. I think I'm done."}
{"text":"For the past couple years have been coming here weekly, sometimes multiple times per week. The Sushi is great and you cant beat the prices. The sushi chef Freddy is top notch, which keeps me coming back and often bringing friends with. I have yet to bring anyone who hasn't enjoyed it. Want amazing sushi at a great price? Check this place out."}
{"text":"I decided to go against my better judgment considering it's hard to find good boba tea, I ordered chicken fryd rice with shrimp added and a 24 oz. strawberry milk boba tea! Sadly when I received my deliver, there was no boba in the tea. Why would you even call it boba tea, and why would you give me a tapioca straw when there's no frickin boba??? Secondly the chicken feels like I'm eating soft tofu. Disgusting. The shrimp tastes microwaved and feels like I'm eating gristle and fat. The rice has corn in it instead of eggs, and HUGE pieces of onion stalk and bean sprouts. 
The hypes I ordered tastes like play dough and the sauce tastes like and old sweaty sneaker smells. In all I would beg any one not to eat here it's terrible."}
{"text":"I usually love this place , but not today. I ordered my food at 345. It was supposed to be here by 445. Plenty of time for me to eat and get ready for work. I finally contacted yelp... who had me waiting for almost 15 minutes. Bottom line... no food... no explanation from the restaurant. The service is usually good. But not today."}
{"text":"Last time I had a bad experience cause I couldn't find anything I liked on the menu and they wouldn't create something for me. My first time here I would have been happy with either sweet potato rolls or general tsos tofo or anything similiar to either of those. The server said it wasn't possible to make and that I was restricted to the menu which wasn't very vegeterian friendly if you're a vegetarian that likes some flavor in your food as I am. This time I asked a different server if I could possibly get sweet and sour tofu with a crispy tofu. The server left to ask the chef and came back with a \"YES WE CAN MAKE IT\", which really surprised me considering how my previous visit went. Maybe my negative review on yelp helped them be more flexible with what they decide to make. The food came out and it didn't look like much quantity-wise when it came to the rice or the sauce but they did hook it up with a good portion of tofu which did fill me up really well. I enjoyed the dish, I just wished it had a better price attached it. Everywhere else a dish like that goes for $6 to $8 tops but then again this is the only place that adds pineapple to it, which I did like. I'm glad I came back even though last time I said I would never be here again. I only came back cause my girl really likes their suchi rolls and that they are 40% off if you dine in. I would've rated 5 stars but $11:25 for a relatively small plate and the bad taste of their tap water forced me to take off a star."}
{"text":"It was fair the service was fair , the food was good if you are in a hurry don't bother . If the owner was listening you would lower the prices and have a happy hour ! You have a bar"}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats and the driver waited over an hour for our food to be prepared to deliver.  Had to cancel the order."}
{"text":"Fresh yummy sushi! There a very few places that I like to eat sushi at and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. We planned on going to Santisi Bros and there were no tables. We had seen the mailer for this place and decided to give it a try. Happy to have a great sushi place so close to home!!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple days ago with my boyfriend quinn for some happy hour and let me tell you, this place is amazing. We sat at the sushi bar where the sushi chef, chris kept up a good convo with us and suggested a few good rolls we should try. We love the fushion style of food and the fact that i can get pho soup or orange chicken is really appealing. JC sushi is a great spot, and we will definatley be back."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Not too salty like some Asian restaurants. I got the beef lo mein....yummy!!!! Excellent service I will surely be back for sho!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner on Saturday with my patents visiting from out of town. I loved everything I ordered. They enjoyed their dishes as well.  I got the edamame, Las Vegas rolls, salmon sashimi, and the pu pu platter. The prices are very reasonable and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst sushi I place I have EVER been to, and I've been to a lot of places. Our server was terrible. He came up to our table and gave us waters, didn't introduce himself and just stood there. I had to actually ask him if he was our server, had no people skills whatsoever. Couldn't answer a whole lot of questions about the menu, and acted like he didn't want to be there. 

We went for happy hour. 8-close. No excuse for bad service or food. 

Okay, about the food:
My friend and I ordered hot and sour soup, and something about it was off. As soon as I tasted it, I regretted ever getting it. Huge disappointment. 

Tempura Calamari: Worst calamari ever. You get only 4 large circle pieces, with tempura fried jalapeños. Why would I want jalapeños? I didn't see a description stating it was so little calamari with so many jalapeños. Waste of money. The calamari was terribly breaded. As soon as I picked it up the breading fell off. Sauce was a creamy wasabi. Mediocre. 

We got three rolls: Tempura California roll, Spicy salmon roll. 
I accidentally marked the Tempura Chicken roll instead of Las Vegas. I told him we didn't like it and he took it off. 
Both were decent. Not great. After the 2 items before that it started to make me question the quality of the food and if I would get sick or not from it (I didn't). 

We ordered chicken chow mein. It was just okay. 

We also ordered Mochi Ice cream, green tea and vanilla. Loved it! Although I'm 100% sure it came pre-made in a box that they ordered and stuck in the freezer. 

$34 in total excluding tip. 
Don't go here. Save your money for another sushi place."}
{"text":"The word \"Sushi\" is prominent in their storefront, so that's what I came here for - once for happy hour and another time for dinner. The sushi is not spectacular but decent. There is not a wide variety of rolls in the sushi menu and the selection of rolls that feature raw fish is sparse; this is definitely an \"Americanized\" sushi selection. Service is friendly, the restaurant is spacious with abundant comfortable seating, and prices are moderate."}
{"text":"Service was ok. The front desk didn't even acknowledge us when we walked in. He was on the phone. Even a simple eye contact while waiting would have been nice. About the food.

We had 40% off Sushi. Quality and taste 4/5.
Miso soup: 5:5

Overall it was good. Service ok. Price good. If I'm ever in the area again, which probably won't be (from vegas), I'll stop by again."}
{"text":"Best delivery and eats! We had the rice noodles w/chicken and Orange Chicken with Fried Rice, all delicious! It was seriously the best Chinese Food I've ever had, the main reason, everything was fresh and hot when it arrived. Absolutely would recommend."}
{"text":"The environment is weird, still looks like a NYC themed restaurant inside where a pop up sushi & Chinese food joint decided to spring up.  Picked it because it was close to the haunted house attraction close by. Service wasn't bad but it wasn't that busy. Sushi was \"ok\" bathrooms were disgusting"}
{"text":"Very Good. The Spicy Crab roll was actually spicy. I am not a sushi snob, but I usually get a spicy crab roll when I have sushi and other places are good, but not that spicy. The spicy crab was perfect here!"}
{"text":"Sushi is awesome and prices are good. Recommend if you're on a budget and want to enjoy good food"}
{"text":"Mongolian beef tasted very fishy. Food was delivered quickly but I wouldn't order here again."}
{"text":"I ordered teriyaki chicken and it didn't even look like chicken. It was a pale color and didn't even looked like it was cooked all the way. Needless to say, I threw it away and will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a lark, glad I did.  It used to be Native New Yorker..now Chinese & Sushi Bar.  The staff are young, friendly and the place has a hip vibe.  The food was great.  I think you should try this one....fresh and well prepared sushi..also good lunch specials...nice big place too, with many TVs and sports to watch."}
{"text":"Went late one night for sushi, was surprised how cheap my tab was 2 beers and 2 orders of sushi. Will for sure go again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon. Happy hour is pretty good. Large portion for the price. We got gyoza for $5 and it had about 12 dumplings. Angry edamame and egg drop soup (which was amaze balls) hubby got a Vegas roll and loved it. I quote, \"Freaking delicious!\" Sake bombs for $5 (full carafe of sake and a pint and a half of kirin). 
Stop here if  you're not a sushi snob and like a sports bar atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and seems to really care if you are satisfied. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Classic bait and switch. The sign outside says \"vietnamese sandwiches\" and they're on the menu, but it wasn't until I had a drink and tried to order one that the waiter told me they hadn't had them for two months or more."}
{"text":"Go to the sushi bar for the best experience. Chris, the sushi chef is great! Very knowledgeable and he'll allow you to do custom orders. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is very close to where I live and I am too lazy to drive far so when the girlfriend wanted sushi we decided to give this place a shot. The curb appeal of this place is definitely lacking but the service and food is awesome. Have never had a bad experience here. This is now our regular sushi spot."}
{"text":"I thought I would try this place out as I have never been here. Alas, they don't want any business and are closed on a Tuesday. Given the honest reviews with 1 star assessments of the food, this place takes their commitment to driving away customers quite seriously. Fortunately for us customers, this isn't the only Asian cuisine in the area and their better quality longer established competition just down the road behind the 7-11 will be getting my money."}
{"text":"First time to visit. We had two take out meals that were great. We will be going back to eat inside and try the sushi. Very nice people."}
{"text":"Best Sushi on the NW side! Very have a very busy schedule and rarely eat out because of all the crap they put in food that is slaughter or grown. 
Long story short. We go out as much as possible with our busy schedules. JCs is the ONLY place we go! We recommend their Sushi as the #1 place in the WORLD. Screw Beverly Hills, New York or San Francisco, or Boston!!!
Come here!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very large newly opened Sushi and Chinese restaurant with a large bar.

My review is based on only one lunch visit.

The service is hit and miss. My server was not at all familiar with the menu. I pointed to what I wanted on the menu and she still had to ask the kitchen if I could have it. After trying to order from her at least three times my husband tried to order and accidentally frightened her (because he is very loud with a deep voice) so she got another server to take our order and we had no problems at all with the other server.

We were going to share a house smoked 2 pc salmon sushi and both ordered the JC Lunch special that was 6 pieces of different Nigiri AND an Eight Piece Roll for $9.95 with an optional $1.00 upgrade charge for a Spicy Tuna Roll or a Las Vegas Roll.

They started us off with a bowl of Miso Soup followed by a crisp salad with fresh tasting Oriental Dressing.

Fresh Wasabi sauce is served on request for a $1.00 Charge. I recommend ordering the wasabi sauce.

We tried a two piece House Smoked Salmon Sushi. It was pretty good and tasty.

Then our big massive plates arrive. I checked the Nigiri and I did notice they didn't season under the fish but all the fish they served me was very fresh. The rice is seasoned more than from most sushi places I've been to but it was good. All the sushi stayed together and didn't fall apart. I thought the spicy tuna roll was very much above average. It was spicy and not all mayo upped. 

I thought the Lunch items were good and reasonably priced. I was happy that the tuna was fresh and sweet tasting because I judge sushi places by the tuna. I can't eat the tuna from at least half the places I try so good tuna is a big deal.

They also offer Happy Hour Specials you might want to partake in. $2.00 Beer $5.00 Sushi 2:30-4:30 and 8pm-close"}
{"text":"Fast delivery with extremely tasty sushi. Definitely would order from here again. The other reviews give this place a bad light, however, I disagree with them. If you like quality sushi for a reasonable price, then check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is in a really cute area. This area needs to add more stores though. I feel like most people would bypass this place unless they were in the area a lot like my boyfriend and I. We like to go to the dollar theatre over by this place and we see it every time so we finally decided to try it this past Wednesday. We had the Philadelphia roll, the futomaki, shrimp tempura, and the dynamite roll. The dynamite has some wasabi sauce or something on it which was really good. That was probably my most favorite. I liked the shrimp tempura least. I usually get it every time and that's because it's my boyfriends favorite. But I didn't like it as much at this place. That's not to say that someone else won't enjoy it. He enjoyed it. I just am not as fond of that roll, in particular this sushi place. I've had it better at other places but even outside of that it's not my favorite. The futomaki was interesting. I liked that a lot too. I definitely recommend the dynamite. I tend to always get the Philadelphia roll since that happens to be one of my favorites. I liked it a lot at this place. It looks a little sketchy on the outside; one because of the area it's in (not a lot of businesses are open in this lot) and two because the outside of the building just looks old. But once you go in, it's a beautiful building. Very decent size. It was a good try for sure."}
{"text":"Definitely will not be ordering from here again, food was not good. Tasted like cheap fast food, chicken teriyaki was terrible. The chicken was not good quality nor was the watery sauce. They forgot to bring our fried rice and for the price, absolutely not worth it. Very disappointed and money wasted."}
{"text":"Upon entering, the first thing you're hit with is an overwhelming smell of old cigarettes and mildew. This used to be a Native New Yorker (or something like that) pizza place back in the day but I don't recall them allowing smoking here so I'm not sure where the smell is coming from. 
A few different rolls were ordered along with a rare beef pho. 
The volcano roll was absolutely awful. They use a blow torch to heat up the top of the volcano roll which causes the roll to become completely soaked in butane. It was completely inedible. The fish also had an overwhelming \"fishy\" smell...anyone who truly enjoys sushi should know it should NOT smell like this. 
The other rolls were the basic avocado and salmon rolls. They were decent and thankfully edible.
The rare beef pho was good. Thank goodness I ordered it, otherwise I would have gone hungry.
A mango boba smoothie was also ordered...it got sent back because the boba was rock hard and the mango \"smoothie\" tasted like chalk. 
Not sure how this place even gets 4 stars. I can only assume the sushi is 40% off for a reason..we're curious to see if we get sick from the sushi. I'll update if we do. 
Unfortunately, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I get delivery all the time and sometimes we go into the restaurant too!

The delivery is super fast and the food is always hot. The portions are larger at the restaurant but definitely not small when you get the food delivered. 

We ALWAYS get the egg drop soup! It's so good. 

We have tried a lot of things on the menu haven't been disappointed. 

With that in mind, you get what you pay for. Don't expect a super fancy place. It's not. But for budget friendly Chinese food, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!!! Great service, even got free sushi to try because it was slow :) we will be returning!!! We're previous Tokyo lobby fans but are now jc sushi fans :)"}
{"text":"Went for 40% off Sushi and was surprised!  Execellant size portions and taste! 
Went back for Lunch Special and again excellent size portions and taste!!  All good here!"}
{"text":"We came in to kill some time before 13th Floor opened. We were seated right away in the bar area. We got a Vegas roll, a Boston roll, and another roll I can't remember the name of. It had a Wasabi mayo on it. To drink we had a sake bomber, a beer, and a Boba tea. The rolls were really unremarkable. Nothing special, and a little fishier tasting than I would have preferred. It was pretty empty, there was a whole half of the restaurant that wasn't being sat, but it was also a Monday night, so maybe it was just a slow night. Our server was really nice and personable though, which saved the experience. Prices are very reasonable, for all three of us our bill was under $40. I won't be back though, I'd rather pay a little more and have better quality seafood."}
{"text":"Sushi chef is amazing! Food is delicious and very affordable. Go there every week and am never disappointed. Staff is friendly and sushi chef loves what he does. Quiet atmosphere with nothing but enjoyable meals. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My husband's and I's go-to. They've had 40% off sushi for as long as he and I have been going (about a year), and it's always been so good. Great sushi for a great price! Their pho is pretty good as well. Very filling!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious especially the pho. The pho is a good portion, and it tastes great. The waitress is nice also. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered through Grub Hub and the first time it was great! I ordered again and it was good! Tonight I ordered and it was terrible! Kung pao chicken tasted like the chicken was going bad and the fried rice was awful. The sauce had as much taste as dishwater! Too bad, because my first two experiences were pretty good."}
{"text":"This is our default go to Chinese food place now. Usual order is orange chicken with white rice, and chicken fried rice with a side order of potsticker sauce. We recently have been ordering the jalapeno chicken but it's too hot for me only if you like spicy. We usually order delivery and it's there quickly"}
{"text":"Very friend and pleasant. Good atmosphere and clean. Descent prices. Serves the good soda - Pepsi!!"}
{"text":"Ordered some food from this restaurant via Uber eats and truthfully it was some of the best sushi I've had in a very long time period as well got some Chinese food to go along with it and it was just as good.

Now I think I'm going to go buy the restaurant in person and see how it is at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good. I had the sushi. My friends really enjoyed the pho. The Vegas roll was great"}
{"text":"We order from JC's regularly through GrubHub. It's always quick and delicious. My husband and I haven't ordered anything we haven't really liked. 

I've had a couple of their rolls (baked scallop, spicy crab (it definitely has a kick), California roll, and the crunchy California roll) and they have all been the correct temperature, even for delivery and are delicious. 

Their egg rolls are some of my favorite and my husband loves their chow mein and orange chicken. 

Highly recommend JC's."}
{"text":"I've loved everything I've ordered since the first time, but today was really just a fantastic experience. I ordered a large order online, both sushi and hot entrees. More so, I was very picky about my order, modifying it down to the veggies in my chicken and asking for multiple sides of sauce. Not only did my food show up amazingly fresh (thanks to Uber eats), but they made my order per every silly request I had and it was AMAZING! Again, always fantastic food, but this really was just an exceptional experience and this will continue to be my go to place for Chinese! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Our food was good. As it has always been.  4stars

Our service was excellent. 5stars

Your standards in the kitchen ...not so much! If you are going to thaw a large slab of beef.. first it has to be at least 6 inches off the floor according to health code. Secondly don't break the rules in front of the kitchen door for over a 45min period while your guest can see such disgusting practices. 

We will not be back. You lost our business"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here through UberEATS! Perfect weekend treat when you don't want to leave the house. Glad we did because everything was delicious and arrived quick, hot, and exactly as requested. 

We got the cream cheese ragoons and gyoza appetizers. Both were very good. The ragoons were light and crisp and paired well with the sweet and sour sauce. We then got the orange chicken and broccoli beef. Delicious! The orange chicken was my favorite. The sauce was thick with a ton of flavor.  Of course it came with white rice that I like to add sweet and sour sauce to. Yum!!! 

Overall everything was super tasty and we will order from here again. I made these left overs for about 3 days and they were still good! I think Chinese food can be reheated 10 times and it's still good. Haha"}
{"text":"Here's a nice Oriental blend for your pallet. Good Sushi fairly priced and several typical Chinese dishes (Kung Pao, Sweet & Sour, etc). All good portions and well done. 
Their decor could use some help but the staff is nice and effecient.
Oh yeah, if you like Sushi they offer all Sushi rolls at 40% off, all day, for dine-in. We just had a Phillie roll, Tempura California roll, & Las Vegas roll all for $15. Can't beat that with a stick! Stop in and give it a try."}
{"text":"We had a coupon for this place that I had purchased quite awhile ago and it was getting ready to expire so we thought we would go ahead and give it a try. To be honest we were a little worried when we drove up. I recognized it as the old Native New Yorker restaurant that used to be there in its place and the parking lot was pretty bare. We went ahead and went in and were seated right away. We both ordered iced teas and we decided on an Edamame to start. Their menu contains a variety of items - from sushi to Chinese food and even Pho. We decided to stick with sushi and ordered three different rolls: Tootsie Roll, Fuji Roll, and a Baked Scallop Roll. We enjoyed all of them and even though the flavors were on point, they seemed a little on the small side. They have lunch specials that appear to be a great bargain and Hubby wants to go back to try the Pho someday."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first and last time tonight with my family. We walked in and stood at the hostess desk for a couple of minutes, while three of the employees were standing at a counter right next to us, they did acknowledge we were there, but we're too busy playing around.  After we were seated, we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who promptly took our order. We ordered a tofu dish, miso soup, and 4 different sushi rolls. The tofu dish was really the only thing that was worth eating, unfortunately.  When the soup came out, it was lukewarm and lacked flavor. When the sushi was brought out the first thing that went through my head was \"wow these rolls are small\". That wasn't the only problem,  not only were they small, they weren't good, and for what we got, they were overpriced.  They tasted like they went across the street to Frys and bought prepackaged sushi. 
They brought the wrong check to our table and then took 10 minutes to come back to the table  so we could explain it wasn't the right check. I could understand if it was busy and waiting that long to get the right check but there was maybe 6 tables that had people sitting at them. After paying $50 for subpar food, I will not be returning  and I will not be surprised if this place doesn't last another 6 months."}
{"text":"Used the Yelp check-in discount for 40% off sushi; tried Pho for my first time. Both were enjoyed experiences. The sushi was fresh and well made. Pho was very subtle in flavor great for influencing the taste you would prefer. Definitely a good place to eat; the seating may be awkward and the booths are kinda small but they did the best they could with the given floor plan!"}
{"text":"Our first disastrous take out order through phone ever. It took mor than 10 minutes to make the other end understand what we want. Though the chicken tempura rolls are on the online as well as their printed menu, the guy who took the call denied to place the order for the same by saying they don't make it, the only make chicken fried rice, then we had to order shrimp tempura roll which was not in our plan. We ordered a second roll which is spicy tuna tempura roll, and since we don't eat raw rolls we specified it MANY MANY times that we want tempura rolls only and he said yes. Upon reaching for pickup we came to know that tuna roll is not tempura one and is raw. The guy who took the order wanted us to somehow have what he was about to give. He insisted us to take that home, but raw sushi is of no use to us and we decided to take only the shrimp tempura roll home. Then he started saying that he heard us ordering spicy tuna tempura roll but since their menu doesn't have such item he had to make it what he wanted us to have. Then we had to show him the same item printed in their menu. Here comes his final lame excuse, it was a technical error.... wow.. he rolled a lot longer than the actual roll. Finally we ended up waiting more for our order. Food was okay but will have to think twice before next time coz its way too much tasks for just two rolls. A friendly reminder to everyone who is going to place a take out order \" if you don't speak their language, then don't make it\" just drive up there make your order wait some time and happily have your order, otherwise you are going to regret time you spent on phone making that order, hearing lame excuses at pickup and wasting some more of your precious time waiting to get what you actually wanted. Good luck."}
{"text":"Horrible. Don't come here. Pho tastes bad, sushi taste bad especially their tempura rolls, teriyaki chicken is blah. The decor is horrible and no one can tell you anything about their different kinds of sake. The only vodka they have is called \"bar code\". Didn't even know that was a vodka. Bill was very expensive for crappy food, was shocked by the bill for such poor quality food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives their orange chicken and he's very picky. I like their kung Pao and shrimp and veggie. I always get it spicy and I think they use just the right amount of spice. Very fresh veggies. Not overly cooked."}
{"text":"The roll menu is pretty basic. If your looking for fancy creative rolls you probably won't find them here.
But what they do have is good. 
Service could be a little better at times."}
{"text":"First time here! It looks like it is New York themed, which I love! I am actually from New York and it does remind me of some restaurants in the city. I ordered the sesame chicken lunch special. It came with a chicken veggie egg roll and cream cheese wonton and my choice of fried rice. It was a good portion, where I had a couple pieces left and I wasn't overly full but I was completely satisfied. I will definitely continue coming to this restaurant and try the sushi next time. Also- I love that it's sushi and Chinese food. Great combination under one roof! 

I forgot to add that the service was great! Fast service, waiter was attentive and friendly. Hostess sat us right away as we walked in. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ordered two Mein Fun lunches with a side of Avocado Cucumber Sushi. This place is so yummy. I have found a new restaurant to eat regularly at."}
{"text":"We ordered California rolls, las  Vegas rolls, edamame, and cream cheese wontons as well as smoothies. All but the las  Vegas roll didn't have any taste to it. The las Vegas rolls were very different from what we have tasted in the past. It had raw salmon or tuna in it was nothing like the las Vegas rolls we have had at several different amazing sushi places. The cream cheese wontons were bland even with the sauce. The only thing that was good was edamame, and the smoothies. It was the worst expierance and not worth $60 we spent!! Shoot we get better fresh sushi at frys On bell 
 On the  up side the delivery driver was very nice and we got the  food earlier than we expected!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. We ordered this from Uber Eats because we were feeling pretty lazy. I got a California roll and king pao beef. My boyfriend got gyoza and orange chicken. Both came with fried rice, which was a disappointment. The rice literally tasted like it only had soy sauce, tiny pieces of egg, corn (?) and tiny pieces of carrot. It has close to no flavor! The meat in the Kung pao beef grossed me out because it didn't seem like the best quality, but the veggies included in it were amazing. **Disclaimer: I am pretty picky about quality of meat** I was not a fan of the California roll, but it also arrived warm because of the uber eats. My boyfriend and I loved his orange chicken and he also approved of the gyoza. I think the trick here is ordering fried when it comes to meat and drowning your fried rice in soy sauce to give it flavor. We honestly probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mongolian beef and orange chicken , food is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here numerous times and love it! The sushi is always delicious and for a very reasonable price! The staff is always super friendly! 

We always order the same sushi rolls but recently tried their chicken tempura roll and it is so good! My boyfriend isn't a huge sushi fan so this roll is one of his favorites. I always get their Philadelphia roll which is always good! I am not a huge fan of their Las Vegas roll only because the salmon is cooked a little different than I am used to but it's still good! Their green tea ice cream is also super delicious! 

I highly recommend this restaurant. It's always clean and never a wait for a table."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. It took a while to get the sushi out even though there were only a few people at the restaurant. The tofu miso was great."}
{"text":"The first time Yell has led us really astray! The four star reviews were shocking now that we have eaten from here. They have a menu that overextended itself in a major and bad way. They aren't capable of specializing in sushi, Chinese, Vietnamese and more, it just doesn't work. The bahn mi tasted like random schezuan sauces stirfry on a loaf of not-quite-French bread, the spring rolls and cucumber salad had shrimp and beef (unexpectedly) which looked really unappetizing when served, the tofu wasn't crispy it was oily and squishy? And the sushi rolls were only just fine/mediocre. Delivery took over an hour and 15 minutes and they missed a portion of the order and offered store credit or redelivery of the missed items. We picked redelivery because we don't intend on dining from here again. Pick somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Our first time here was amazing, staff was on point, food was hot, and our sushi was 50% each roll. Our second time here was not so good. Staff was slow, gave hot tea when I said iced, food was luke warm, sushi was loose and hard to pick up and to much cucumber in them, sushi was 40% but not on each roll cause the computer gives it at end according to waiter. Intresting that we got 50% each one last time. Will not be back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Sweet and sour chicken is great. Lo mein has no flavor but the pork was good. Egg rolls were big and tasty but crab puffs were small and bland. Overall, I'd say it was ok."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous coming here but don't let the appearance fool you. The food was amazing. I got the shrimp and broccoli lunch special and it was definitely east coast style. Added a little spice to it and it was bomb! My coworker got the spicy tuna roll and edamame and both were tasty. The edamame had table salt which gave it a weird taste, could've used some sea salt. Other than that, it was all very tasty! I'll definitely be back. Oh and did I mention sushi is 40% off all rolls!"}
{"text":"JC Sushi had me somewhat confused. As with a lot of restaurants we try for the first time, we found this place on  Groupon. It's somewhat odd. We parked right in back of the building and went up the handicapped ramp only to find a door with no handle. Headed around to the side of the building to enter. The place is much bigger than you'd expect and strangely empty. There is a large foyer and to the right, it appears there is a good sized dining room that is empty. We were greeted promptly and taken to a table close to the sushi bar. The decor is interesting: Beer signs adorn the walls (American and Japanese), some \"flags\" and some red Oriental lanterns over some of the booths. This area has about 10 tables. There was one other couple in a booth while we were there. On the walls of this small space were 4 televisions going, all without sound and some with Spanish closed captioning. It felt like it could turn into something else (a deli?, a barbecue?)  with 20 minutes notice. I ordered the pork lomein. While a bit on the greasy side, I was hungry and it tasted very good--lots of pork and full of veggies. It was a large portion and I shared with my husband who ordered sushi. He had no real complaints but thought it was just average. Servers were prompt, polite and robotic--no expression. Not sure if we will go back."}
{"text":"Very good service! Just went there because of the excellent reviews. I didn't like. 3 stars just for the good service."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout: pho ga, Kung pao chicken and crunchy California roll. The chicken for the pho ga and Kung pao was slimy and smelled weird. I couldn't even eat it I just dumped it. I started eating the sushi which wasn't bad and then I found a hair. So basically it was all a waste of money which I threw in the garbage, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Just got home from JC'S and I am very impressed. The food was quite a step up from our old regular place. The vegetables were crisp, the shrimp was fresh, the beef was tender with no fat or gristle. The resturant was very nice."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here and the food was beyond horrible.  The Dim Sum Soup was tasteless and the sushi I ordered was not fresh, the salmon was brownish not pink or orange like it should have been, and the spicy crab roll had to much wasabi and was horrid.  The service was slow at first till we brought that to their attention.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"never again. This place was nasty! My boyfriend and I went to JC's after hearing that it was really good... Once we had ordered our food, it took quite awhile to receive it. Come to find out, that the sushi that was sitting on the counter for about 15 minutes, was our Las Vegas Roll. I took a bite of it and wanted to throw up. My boyfriend kept eating it until he couldn't take it anymore. After we left, our stomachs hurt so bad, and we knew it was from the nasty Vegas roll.
Another thing to think about, sushi restaurants aren't supposed to smell fishy. This place smelt like we were right on the ocean. I dont know, Ive been to probably 30 different sushi restaurants, and this was the first one that smelt like raw fish. Then again, the smell was probably coming from the guy who had every container full of fish, sitting out in the open with no lid, and no refrigeration. Very unsanitary. I work in a restaurant, and I know how sanitation works...that was not something they would pass a health inspection with."}
{"text":"Great food!! Fast, friendly and fun service. Nice and clean inside, worried when we pulled up and there was only a few cars in the parking lot, but VERY happy we didn't leave. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, and the sushi was to die for. With the more than reasonable price this place is a must go if your looking for good sushi."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi, the sushi is really sub par. It didn't seem that fresh however, it's wasn't fishy. For example, the smoked salmon tastes exactly like the prepackaged smoked salmon they sell at Costco or Safeway, definitely not sushi grade. The main ingredient in most of the rolls is \"crab mix\" which is short hand for imitation crabmeat and mayo, the cheapest filler imaginable. That being said everything is cheaply priced. Not the worst sushi I've ever had but definitely not the best."}
{"text":"I had called in to get sushi delivered. The first person could not help me when i asked a couple simple questions about how many each item are pkged..Also asked which fish is wrapped with. The second person answered my questions. I began to order, however they told me they were busy and hung up on me."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour at 8:00pm. It was quiet and slow, which was a great pace for us after returning from out of town. We were promptly greeted and seated.

We ordered straight off the happy hour menu a Las Vegas, Philadelphia, shrimp and calamari tempura rolls and two draft beers. 

The food was good. The presentation was-eh. The service was very attentive and accommodating.

The bathrooms smelled... I believe the technical term is...crappy."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time just opened absolutely the best sushi place I have been too! Fantastic portions and wonderful service!!! Will highly recommend going"}
{"text":"I got the fried gyoza, shrimp tempura roll, and mushroom with beef and veggies. Everything was very good, especially the roll. I ordered delivery online and paid through Yelp with PayPal. Quick, easy and yummy! I will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Did I....find it? Have I finally found my treasured Chinese food restaurant? 

I feel as though Ive been a character in a video game battling terrible Asian food places. From undercook rice to soggy sweet n sour chicken, and questionable \"meat\" on skewer sticks. 

But, I think Ive found my castle.

ITS ABOUT TIME.

Ordered delivery at about 9pm this evening via Yelp. It arrived piping hot at about 30 after. Really fast for what I ordered Id say. 

I ordered, Orange chicken, with brown rice, extra spicy (I love spice!), Mei Fun with chicken, and an order of fried dumplings. 

Is it weird that I judge a restaurant by how their brown rice is cooked? Yeah? Well, tough. Brown rice takes some extra care when cooking it to make sure it has that perfect texture. That \"spring\". Their brown rice is lit. Cooked so well, it made me take a moment of silence. Good brown rice is hard to come by. 

The spicy orange chicken. Fried to perfection and still so hot that it burned my mouth. Well worth it. Anyway, white meat chicken. All white meat. And still juicy. I ordered the sauce on the side (something I've had to do living in AZ, most of the Chinese food places out here water their sauces down, which then causes fried meats to go soggy quick). But, there was no need here. The sauce was full of citrus-y spicy goodness. Actual orange triangles were in the sauce. Along with CRISP green bell peppers, onions, and a few slivers of carrots (not a fan of cooked carrots anyway). The sauce was thick and a rich brown color, stick to yer ribs sort of sauce. There was only one chili pepper in the batch, but I'm more than okay with this, why? Because the quality. This one chili pepper absolutely trumped all the others I've had from previous places out here. You know what Im referring to, those leathery, odd flavored \"chilis\" that you find. Makes you wonder if they plucked them from some dusty Southwestern motif. 

Anyway, here, It was freshly dried. You could tell they even PAN FRIED it before adding it to the sauce. A key step. Not kidding. Dried chili peppers can go bad and lose their flavor over time. But the fresh ones, if they're warmed up before using them in cooking, oohh it makes a world of a difference. Gives it an added kick.

I haven't been able to touch the fried dumplings. Way too full. 

My boyfriend had the chicken Mei Fun. He LOVED it. Which for me, is another win. Appeasing his hunger for Chinese food is difficult. He's from Boston, if that gives you an idea.

I feel like I've really, truly won with this place. I found the princess, and she's in THIS castle. 

Ill order their Pho and sushi next time. I'm going to get fat :("}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi and Saki! Great service and very reasonable prices. Two happy hours with $5 rolls and suggest you ask for the fresh Wasabi, extra cost but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I ordered spicy crispy beef and it was soggy, extremely chewy and no spice at all.  The onions carrots was showed no knife skills and were not appealing to the eye and were over cooked.  The sauce was very watery and dropped off everything and was bland.  Was definitely no good reheated as leftovers ."}
{"text":"Good sushi, reasonable even without their 40% off deal.  Quiet when we came (outside lunch or dinner time).

They have delivery and take out.  Have to try the Chinese takeout next time!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all - sushi was fresh and Chinese food dishes were tasty!  Had the Ma Po Tofu - delish!  Menu had a wonderful picture of shave ice but they don't have any - too bad!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and some friends have made this place our Sunday dinner every week. We used to go to a couple of different places but this has definitely been the best. Every day is 50% off of all sushi rolls. Each roll that we try has been amazing. I have never had a bad experience here and I have been here more than a handful of times. Customer service has always been wonderful and the food is amazing. I would recommend the orange chicken. The portion is huge and it tastes amazing. 
I was sad to see that it was closed last Sunday due to some work that may have been done one the place. But I always look forward to Sundays!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese and sushi comparable to New York food and some of the best I have found here in Arizona.  You must try their sushi rolls now half price sun-thurs all day and their orange chicken or shrimp to die for!  Five stars from me my family and friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Learned of JC Sushi and Chinese off of our Nextdoor app. Didn't believe that a place that took over the location of some restaurant we never went to would be good. We were wrong. Dead wrong.  Good is an understatement. Great is getting close to the quality. 

First off. Don't be dismayed by no one being there. As many times as we have gone for dinner, no one is hardly ever there. Second - if the bar is open, grab it. The bartenders are funny, courteous and helpful. Additionally, the bar backs up to the sushi bar and many times they will send over samples of something they are trying out.  Third, live it up. Sake bomber? Hell yeah, why not. Quail Egg? Of course. Try it all. Ask about the specials and what the staff likes. We have yet to walk out disappointed. Prices are similar to Ra or Ahso and there are great happy hour prices Monday - Thursday. No negatives here other then I wish they had a better bar area for happy hours. I think they should add some TV's and really push happy hour. Live a little and try something different, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The jalapino chicken was great. My wife is vegetarian and the sauce may have had oyster sauce in it but was also pretty good. My daughters could share one kids meal as it was enough food."}
{"text":"This place opened up by my sisters house here right around the corner. Saw the reviews and decide to come try this place. I think the concept is perfect because I love sushi and my kid loves chinese food. 

We came for the lunch special and the price was reasonable for the portions that it came with. We ordered sushi, spicy tuna roll & Phili roll and Chinese food, which was a little over salted. 

The dining area is large and looks outdated, lighting is dim and there is a small tv in the bar/sushi area. Could probably use some music playing or maybe the volume turn on the T.V. Overall food is good for a quick lunch nothing stood out."}
{"text":"Sushi was great and food was nice and hot! Ordered the Vegas roll and Chicken Lo Mien. Service was great. The inside is much nicer than I expected. Was here during happy hour 230-4 and sake bombs $5 on top of 40% off rolls all day!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, great service. The rolls were good so was the miso soup. Will be coming in again soon. I wish there were more fresh rolls on special though."}
{"text":"Ordered from here from the UberEats app as they were one of the few places that delivered.

Wow where do I start? Ordered pho..the broth was obviously not beef..more like someone dropped a Maggi cube in hot water. 

The fried rice was so hard and crumpy that I questioned it's freshness.

Anyways, ended up throwing all away and ended up going out like I should have done in the first place."}
{"text":"I wasn't a big sushi fan until coming here. Now, i crave it once a week!  Along with the Kirin and saki. Kids love it too (the food). Very reasonably priced. 
It is simple and clean and the staff is very friendly. Don't let the look of the outside fool you. It is the old Native New Yorker. If you dine in it is 40% sushi. Just remember, they are closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Ordered from here last week for delivery. We ordered orange chicken, edamame, cream cheese wontons, house wonton soup, sweet and sour pork, and spicy tuna rolls for $47.38 before tip. The food was delivered quickly and was hot. The prices decent compared to others and the food was pretty good. My favorite was the orange chicken when I had added a little bit of spice."}
{"text":"The service is very bad. The food is ok, but the server didn't speak English well to understand what we wanted to order, for sushi order she did not bring the saucer for soy sauce I asked for it. Sake salmon is just plain fresh salmon, not like anywhere else and it had bones in it. Sushi guy, wipes his nose on his sleeve while making sushi, that looked disgusting.
Anyway, the service and servers very slow, unattended .
I hope it was just our luck and not the every day service."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this restaurant has 3.5 stars.

Everything we had was abysmal. The jalapeno chicken was coated in sugar. The pho we ordered had meet that was green. The softshell crab roll didn't seem like it had softshell crab in it.

Everything about this restaurant is just off. If you're looking for authentic Asian food, go somewhere else. This is a shame for me to say, because all the service staff are Chinese. Too bad they can't make real Chinese food."}
{"text":"I would pass... Like most things these days, everything is someone else's fault... as is the case with JC and Uber Eats

Ordered JC Sushi and Chinese...
1 Kung Pao Chicken with fried rice
1 beef Pho

What was delivered by uber eats...
1 Kung Pao Chicken (No Rice)
1 Beef Pho (Cold, flavorless).  The worst Pho she has ever tasted.

Complained via Uber Eats app then called the restaurant.  I asked if there was something we could do to get new food.  The extremely rude employee who answered said that this isn't their problem it is Uber Eats problem.  I explained, I understand but you forgot to give us the rice and the food was of poor quality.  Again, he said, \"it is not our problem, its Uber Eats\".  I finally lost my will to argue and said: \"Ok, goodnight\".

I didn't want my money back, I just wanted dinner for my girlfriend and me.  

Seems that JC's does not care if its food is good...rude staff, poor quality, rude staff..they just want your money, dont waste it here."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout through GrubHub. It came quickly & the delivery man was very courteous & helpful. The food arrived hot & tasted yummy! We ordered for lunch but had enough for dinner too. The only way it could have been better was if we had gotten the two sides of sweet & sour sauce and soy sauce that we had ordered - there was only one sweet & sour sauce cup and the egg roll was extremely small. We ordered orange chicken and General Tso's chicken, both were great. We will order from here again!"}
{"text":"Follow up. I did hear from the owner who was genuinely concerned over the service I received and has offered to make things right. Will definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"Ended up getting food to go, got the dinner special of orange chicken and a avocado cucumber roll. The sushi was fresh and the chicken is huge a big thumbs up"}
{"text":"Not recommended for sushi, my husband and I have had much better right down the road at Mr Sushi! Go the couple extra exits to northern and you will not be disappointed as we were with this sad excuse of sushi  :( We won't be going back. Staff was very nice but food was lacking on quality and creativity. Tummy hurts from this attempt to try someplace new.  My five year old tried the \"spicy\" tuna with no spice without complaint.  Rainbow roll, Las Vegas roll, and sweet sour soup not very satisfied.  This building would be much better suited as a bar. Ouch my tummy."}
{"text":"I ordered food from JC Sushi and Chinese through Ubereats.  The Thai Tea was great, but the Pho, it is better to eat them from an authentic Vietnamese Restaurant.  Since this is a Chinese restaurant, I will give them another chance and try their Chinese food."}
{"text":"JC Sushi is amazing! The rolls are delicious. I enjoy coming here with friends or family."}
{"text":"Walked in not really expecting much especially since they had a half price sushi sign outside, but it's a new establishment and obviously just to get people in to try things on the menu. They have so much to choose from. My daughter got a mango smoothie.. And I got an iced viet coffee. It was so good. Sushi was super fresh and tasty as well. They kind of lack a sense of urgency when you walk in, but our server was super friendly and the food was great."}
{"text":"My daughter had an appointment at the salon in the same plaza, so when I looked up Chinese on yelp, this came up. She was craving chicken egg rolls, and they have them so....I ordered by phone 4 items, and was told 10 minutes. That should have told me. But....
Hot and sour soup: not spicy, no vinegar, no shrimp or pork, no bamboo shoots. Tasted like oily chicken stock, (I bet it coagulates by morning), and had soggy cabbage (...what?...). I took out all the cabbage, added siracha and rice vinegar and could eat it. . Chicken egg rolls have just that. Chicken and a little cabbage. No more veggies or flavors. Fried rice: No peas, teenytiny bits of carrots. Miniscule egg. Cream cheese puffs aren't bad, but maybe more than 1/8tsp each would be great. Orange chicken: Not too bad. All sweet, though. No heat. We are there in the plaza 3/week, but will never go back. I did, however, call and give them my opinion. I hope they run with it. It was 100% honest and spot on."}
{"text":"We had seen this places flyers in our mail and finally gave it a try, pleasantly surprised.  The jalapeño chicken was really excellent.  It was nice and spicy, chicken was deep fried and perfect.  My wife got the sesame chicken and said it was really great.   Hopefully people will support this place as we want to be able to eat here for a long time."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were recently looking for a new sushi place in the north Phoenix area due to the fact that the past four or five places we had gone to were tolerable and best and we walked in then right out at worst. We had past the building that used to be Native New Yorker and saw they had a big banner outside advertising 50? off sushi rolls all day during the week so we decided to try it out, how bad can it be? We were actually presently surprised, the space is huge for the amount of customers in the location though. But the waiter and sushi chef were both very attentive and presented the best product we've had in the past year. It's not the best sushi we've ever had but in the north Phoenix area it's definitely in my top three. Especially if you're able to come in during the week and take advantage of their 50% off offer. We ordered 4 rolls and 2 sake bombers and our bill was only about 40 bucks. Definitely worth a stop in, they also have Great lunch specials for their Chinese food and sushi combos."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant last Friday?the food is so delicious and all the servers there were friendly. The restaurant makes me feel like at ho"}
{"text":"Well after eating here and being up alll night long with the worst stomach pains and throwing up . I guess u can say we won't be returning here at all ... was good the first time we tried it but actually going in and sitting down eating at the restaurant instead of take out .. over all worst experience! So sad but we will not be returning .... chicken didn't even taste like chicken at all !! And sushi tasted Gas Station Bought! ..... staff was not that friendly either ... sat on there phones and waited around our table like they just wanted us to leave ... didn't even wanna rate it but .. the Boba Tea was the only thing good ..."}
{"text":"Was on my way to applebees for a nice cheap dinner and came across this place.. I was surprised to see it occupied after my beloved Native Grill(Native New Yorker closed down a while back.  For some reason I was intrigued to check it out so plans changed a bit.  Luckily it was happy hour and I was happy to see that they had the $5 large sake bombs on the happy hour menu. Also something about $2 beers.  Since it was a bit later they had the happy hour menu which I was happy to see included soups, apps, sushi favorites and chinese!  My aunt and I ordered the tempura combo which was very good and included fried mushroom, shrimp, broccoli, sweet potato and onion ring.  It was delicious!  Only recommendation is to maybe offer a tangy sweet or spicy sauce and not the mayo based stuff.  It was still pretty good. For dinner I got the kung pao chicken and we split the Philly Roll and Shrimp Tempura roll. Both were in generous portions and the presentation was awesome.  It tasted very good and came out extremely quick.. I was a bit disappointed that they were so slow because I really would like to have a local sushi restaurant in the neighborhood.  Overall I was very pleased with the sushi and happy hour portioned Chinese and I'm excited to come back and try some of their chinese dishes and try some more sushi.  It was priced right, tasty, and in a pretty good location(by Santisi Brothers and Applebees)  I did find it kind of funny that they had all of the Native New Yorker signs inside. This place seems HUGE for a sushi/chinese joint but I will do my best to come back often and share with my friends and family on this side of town!  It's definitely a great new place!"}
{"text":"No just no . Server was rude ... watched the server picking his nose and touching the food ... so smelly in there !  Oh my the cream cheese won tons are soooo salty !  Won't be going back for sure ."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The food is amazing and the pricing is so reasonable! And they deliver!!!! The lo-mein noodles and fried rice are so delicious. I still haven't tried out other things on the menu but from what I've tried so far, they probably wont disappoint."}
