{"text":"I agree with previous posters: it is a gem for Henderson. Chef Bernard is nice, Roger, the manager makes sure you are treated very nice. I live very close and I go there once a week. Food is delicious but I have to say is not 5 stars. There is always something left wanting: the calamari are a little on the oily side and too little compared to the onions. The french onion soup is indeed The best. The meatloaf is drenched in tomato sauce and, sorry, but is too acidic. The crepes sound like a good idea but they always come out too dried from the oven and you end up having to cut the ends out. They have indeed amazing pasta, schnitzel, and sandwiches. I would never go again for fish and chips, nor steak and fries, you can do better some other place. The flat breads are worthy! 
I see they incresed the prices a little bit, very little.
I am waiting for them to create the patio, put some greens, some potted flowers, maybe a little enclosure, to hide the street traffic. The brunch is not superior in terms of value and the sauces are a little on the heavy side for brunch. 
The wines are overpriced for the quality, but hey...
Finally, the sangria is really, really good.
The atmospehere is always select, great people coming in, I even saw local celebrities! 
All in all, I am happy they are here, I wish them the best and I will continue to regularly come in."}
{"text":"I like this place. It turns my woman on. The best French onion soup I've ever had. The escargot is outstanding. Try the ny strip and the seafood crepes. Room is good for families as well."}
{"text":"Our family went there on Friday.  I was concerned that it would not be kid friendly but they had a great kids menu.  The service was amazing.  The food was even BETTER.  This is our new favorite place."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw this open today so we decided to try it for dinner.  Let's start by saying... We LOVE food, specially European and she is such a picky eater it's annoying sometimes but this place made her eyes shine!! Service was fast and friendly. The dude filled up my water every time that it went bellow half way. I drink a lot of water so that made me happy. Our waitress checked on us every other second no joke! Even the manager came to ask how everything was. The offered more bread when we got the escargot and kept bringing it to our table ( we are bread people!) The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food as amazing as it looks, it was food art!! We had the escargot (to die for) tuna tartare (sauce came inside an egg!... Freaking awesome!!!) and the salmon with pesto mash potatoes! Amazing!!! Overall great effing restaurant!!! Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Service and food all excellent. We have eaten in many high end restaurants all over Las Vegas, and this place is right up there. Just happened upon it the other night, and what a treat. We had escargot (ordered a second one was so good), calamari, whitefish (best entree), filet medallions, spaghetti and meatballs, and a crepe. Everything was delicious, including the warm crusty bread. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Never had anything I didn't like at Bernard's!!! I should rate it bad so I can always get a seat.."}
{"text":"The best part of Bernard's is the atmosphere.  Live music, good service and patio seating options.  Also, it's hard to find a restaurant in Henderson that isn't a chain. 
We went with the escargot to start.  This was the best thing we had here! They were delicious!! Buttery, bacon goodness.  The dipping bread was tasty, too.
For the main course we went for the Italian side of things, the meatballs and capellini. I liked these dishes but I wasn't in love. The capellini was sweet for my taste and the sauce on the meatballs could have used a bit more flavor.  
We had the crime brûlée for dessert.  Very good! Made in house.
Since this is more of a French inspire restaurant I probably should have leaned toward the more French dishes and will venture that direction on the next visit.  
I've heard great things about the quiche and the steak looked tasty when delivered to a nearby table.
I think the menu was overwhelming. I typically like a smaller more specialized menu and I think they would benefit from removing some items. Their pricing was reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Bernard's Bistro on Sunset is our new favorite restaurant.  I can't say enough about the ambiance, the service, and the FOOD.  This is just what Henderson needs--exquisite food at a reasonable price.  The Brazilian Chicken, the Argentinian Chicken, and the Fish and Chips are delectable--and oh those desserts!  Chef Bernard, Roger and Rose treated us like royalty.  Thank you for making dining a treat."}
{"text":"Ate there last Monday night. All seemed well. Have been trying to make reservations for 3 days and nobody answers the phone. Drove by earlier today - sign in the window says:  Restaurant Closed with no other explanation. I'm afraid they're gone and it was one of my favorites."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp I couldn't wait to try this place...WHAT A MISTAKE! This could have been one of the worst meals I have ever had. I ordered the mushroom and chicken Crepes, they were drowning in what tasted like a flour and water mixture, the crepes were like dough,  ugh! I got the onion soup which was SALTY to say the least and to top it off they served it with the filthiest spoon ...old cheese and herbs were stuck to it! I was so disappointed in this place....my advice to u is to SKIP IT! I have never given a review before on here but felt compelled to do the public a favor and warn them about this place!"}
{"text":"Had our 34th anniversary dinner here tonight. The food and the service was tremendous...Love this place!! Will come here again soon."}
{"text":"Very good food, service and ambience. Came in and noticed they had a performer for \"Sinatra Night\" which was a bit out of place for my taste but some old timers probably loved it. ordered the mesculin salad and ahi tar tar to start. both very good and beautiful presentation. followed up with Sinatra Sea Bass and Crusted Lamb. Crusted Lamb is crazy good. wine selection is good as well. I will for sure be back ordering the Lamb."}
{"text":"The beet salad and escargot are amazing! Our service was awesome and there was live music.  I loved this place and indefinitely bringing family when they Come to town!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time on Christmas eve. We LOVED it. The staff was professional, attentive and courteous, and the food was perfectly prepared. 

We got the roasted beet/goat cheese appetizer - it comes with mixed greens and balsalmic reduction - wonderful flavor combination - not the type of appetizer we usually get. Trying something new paid off!

I got the Bistro Chicken Schnitzel and my husband got the Bistro Goulash Beef Casserole. Both were excellent, and reminded us of another favorite restaurant we used to frequent years ago. 

For dessert we got the key lime cheesecake and the apple tart. Loved both. We were very impressed with our dining experience and will be back FOR SURE."}
{"text":"I Love this restaurant and the owner(s) + management. 

My husband and I had our wedding reception here.  The GM, Hugo, met with us several times to ensure every detail of our special day would be taken care of.  Bernard and his wife are caring and extremely professional.  

FOOD- five stars - we felt like our meals were great, well prepared, good protons.  Wine was well paired to our food.  

Service- outstanding.  The staff was working non stop during the night to ensure that all of the guest were fed and felt comfortable.  

As our night continued onto LaConessa for the after party, Bernard himself assured that our food was well prepared and came on boat to check up on it. 

I am a customer for life.  We LOVE this restaurant.  Best of Lake Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Had Easter brunch here with my in laws. Service was excellent as was the food. Reasonable prices also."}
{"text":"I just had dinner with a good friend, and boy was I pleasantly surprised!! This place is an awesome restaurant... From the time you arrive up til you walk out. Service was excellent, as well as the food .....
The atmosphere was awesome as well ,with the sounds of Frank Sinatra playing set the mood  just right ....
Loved it,and highly recommend ......"}
{"text":"Decided to take my family to dinner when they were in town visiting.  Called ahead to make a reservation since we were a party of 8.  Really don't have anything negative to say, food and service were great.    Really enjoyed the singer/pianist and the atmosphere.  My only small complaint was the cost of the daily special, when looking at the menu you would assume it is priced along with the rest of the menu but it was almost double, so was kind of of a shock, but still very delicious.  Will definitely come back and look forward to sitting outside this spring/summer when the weather is nice.  Thank you for putting a bistro like this in our community, it is long over due."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were anxious to try Bernard's Bistro for months, hoping that it could be a nice addition to our restaurant rotation once it opened. Unfortunately, even after giving it a second try, I can't imagine us coming back. I'll critique our most recent visit based on three areas: service, food, and atmosphere.

Service: The service fluctuates between over the top and stilted to rude. The manager and a server held both doors open for us when we arrived, which was a bit unusual given the casual atmosphere I expect from a neighborhood bistro. But the manager was cordial and told us we could choose a booth by the window or the wall. Mistakenly, we chose the booth by the wall. Apparently we were sitting in the section of a waiter who had no interest in serving us. After walking by us repeatedly and ignoring us for 10 minutes, he pulled another employee aside and whispered in his ear, pointing (pointing!) at us as they both looked straight at me and my boyfriend. It was incredibly uncomfortable. After a wait of about 15 minutes, another server came to take our drink orders. She wasn't necessarily impolite, but I think she had bigger fish to fry. Perhaps she pulled the short straw and had to wait on us. We barely saw her throughout the meal. Although, I should mention that she did help me to modify my dish to my taste (wasabi mashed potatoes tend to be heavy on the wasabi most places), which I appreciated.The only genuinely friendly interaction we received was from the busser who would chat with us when dropping the bread, gathering plates, etc. The night was a mix of \"Welcome to our finest guests!\" and \"Ugh, I have to go talk to these people again.\" 

Food: We had the escargot appetizer to start, as well as the soup of the day, carrot ginger. I had the seared ahi tuna entree and my boyfriend had the filet medallions. The escargot was good, but the mushrooms and tomatoes in the sauce were raw. We ordered the same dish the first time we visited Bernard's and it was better then. This is a small issue though; we sopped up the sauce with the bread long after the last snail had been devoured! The carrot ginger soup was also tasty. I was worried it would be a bit thin, but it had a very nice consistency. The entrees, however, were a mess. My seared ahi tuna was so chewy that I couldn't finish my meal. Honestly, I had to spit some out. It was not my finest hour. And my boyfriend's medallions were the consistency of a burger. The real problem were the sauces. The medallions come with a trio of sauces: peppercorn brandy, red wine, and citrus. They are all the same brown gravy sauce with additions. The citrus was the most offensive. Imagine gravy with orange drink mixed in. The plating and presentation seem outdated to me or like a plate you would be served from a catering service at a wedding reception. For example, the dollop of mashed potatoes is put on the plate with one of those cake nozzles. The sides are finickily arranged vegetables. It's like, \"Here, have one steamed asparagus stalk perched upon a single zucchini coin, which is set next to a curly-cued lemon rind and surrounded by a fan of pea pods.\" 

Atmosphere: I think that this restaurant is suffering from a confused identity. We happened to eat on \"Titanic Night,\" which means that there is a special menu option (that we didn't take), they play the movie Titanic on flat screens around the restaurant, and there is a pianist. It's a strange theme for a \"California French\" bistro. You can tell that Bernard likes Titanic from the wall decorations. Well, some of them. Others are \"French-y\" things, like fleur-de-lis, while others are photographs of the meals. It's like Shenanigans. But despite the wall decor, which is fine because it's a bistro and needs to be casual, everything else is over the top. For example, the servers and bussers are in fine-dining attire, like tux shirts. Some customers were in shorts and flip flops; others were business casual. It was hard to get a read on just where we were exactly. 

I'm okay with a confused identity or average service. If the food is good and a nice enough person delivers it, I don't care if you want to be a French Titanic bistro from California. But the rude server who refused to acknowledge us and the bad entrees push this restaurant in the 1.5 star range for me."}
{"text":"Bernard's is one of the Best restaurants in Henderson, if not all of Las Vegas off the strip. I recently ate there on pairing night and it was spot on. The appetizer started with prosecco, a winner in my book, that was matched with a perfectly cooked artichoke. Then a salad with rose, followed by Salmon with pinot noir. All food was presented with the beauty and flair that is a staple at Bernard's, and The flavors were varied and delicious. They do the prix fixe menu once a month and it's clear they are exercising their creativity with these meals. I highly recommend it, or even just a regular dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"This is the perfect restaurant, such a gem. Nice music. Delicious food. Reasonable pricing. Wonderful staff. Large portions."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was manic at best. Multiple signs telling me to \"EAT\" which is ironic considering the food was pretty inedible. You're greeted at the door by a faithful replica of the captain of the doomed ocean liner, Titanic. How that factors in to the food or the decor, I still have no clue. In retrospect, I think it was a premonition. 

Onto the food. I ordered the NY Steak Frites. My steak was tough and tasted strongly of regret also the gas grill it was fired on. The sauce that accompanied it was minimal in both taste and amount. And the vegetables served were bland and undercooked. The only part of our meal that was satisfying was the Caprese Salad. Which it's pretty hard to mess up slices of cheese, tomato, and basil. 

If you enjoy subpar food, disturbing decor, and paying way too much, then you will love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food, ample variety, great service and decor. What a nice local restaurant that isn't an assembly line franchise. The quality of service and food really surprised us. I drove by for months noticing that there were always a good crowd eating. Finally went with the wife and we were both very pleased. Will go back for sure. We used to love Panavino but now this place is our bees-knees."}
{"text":"The food was alright.  Nothing special.  The service, however, was the worst I've ever had.  The hostess was nice, but the waiters and waitresses were the most unprofessional people ever.  We got fried calamari for appetizer and it literally got 5 pieces of calamari and the rest was fried onions.  The waiter used a lighter to check our ID's.  We ordered a bottle of wine and when we're done with the wine the waitress kept pushing us to get more alcohol and was rude when we said no.  The waitress dropped the silverware when she replaced it for us and yelled \"shit\".  Hey lady, we can hear you.  And she examined the receipts to see how much tip we gave her right in front of us while we're still at the table.  How rude can a person be.  Let's just say this is our first and will be last time here.  I have to give a star because I had to in order to write a review."}
{"text":"I shouldn't tell you about this place... but, I will. It's kind of a 'secret spot', and well worth a visit. Most of the food is French fusion, but the menu is pretty diverse. I personally like the salmon, the quiches, and the artisan cheese plate, the most. They also have a nice Moroccan chicken dish, a tasty beef pasta casserole, and a good tandoori. They frequently add new selections, and change things up. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. Live music, nice staff, good wine list. Options on the menu for picky eaters or kids, too. I haven't been there for brunch, yet, but hear that they offer a nice one. It's near my home, which is how we found out about Bernard's. I understand that there is another location at Lake Las Vegas. I recommend you call, in advance, as the word has gotten out."}
{"text":"I had the Casablanca burger which was great. My dad had a hard time deciding btw his usual cod chip which he loves or the seafood special. He decided on the seafood special, the sauce was great it had a complex citric taste. My sister had the tagine chicken and loved it."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Super ambience. The salmon and filet mignon have never failed to wow us. This is a welcome treat to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"What a gem this neighborhood restaurant is. Definitely 5 star service from the moment you enter to the moment you leave. The menu is amazing! There is something for every palate. I have visited several times so I could give a true, multiple visit review. The appetizers, tuna tartar so fresh and the plating, exquisite .  Calamari, so tender and the sauces 2, both equally enticing. Generous portions , personable, I'm getting so hungry just writing. Entrees, generous, accommodating , delicious you will savor every bite. They also have theme nights, Sinatra which features live talent is such amazing ambience. I love Titanic night,  Chef Bernard prepares dishes from the original Titanic menu......so creative! I absolutely love it here and will continue my weekly visits!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Bernard's on Lake Las Vegas and were excited to see him open another location very close to our house!

My lovely wife suggested we go there for Valentines Day and what a great idea it was!

We nearly left when the young hostess informed us that only outside seating was available! Roger the Mgr? Was very gracious and warmly escorted us in with the pick of our own table!

Thank you Roger! You are a true Professional! 

Rose our waitress was fabulous! Professional, warm, courteous and knowledgable about wine pairings and was spot on helping us pick some compatible wines for our entrees.

Thank you Rose!

My filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare and the vegetables n fries were also cooked n seasoned to perfection!

Same goes for my wife's salmon!

Rose suggested a tart n crem brûlée for desert along with a desert wine and it did not disappoint ! 

Fabulous place and we highly recommend it!

Only negative is the young inexperienced hostess who does not have the same personality and \"dedication to service\"as Roger and Rose!

We will be eating here frequently irregardless !

Cheers :-)"}
{"text":"Went here today for my friend birthday. He loved the place. Everyone is very friendly took care of us. This is our Hot spot now. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had dinner here this evening and it was excellent. the waitress lynn was exceptionally attentive even though we were the only ones eating outside (by request). I had the brazilian chicken which was great, my girl had vegetarian crepes. she really enjoyed both her entree and side salad which had their special beet vinaigrette."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 34th Anniversary at Bernardo's Bistro. The food and service was outstanding. Definitely a favorite quaint romantic dine that is sure to be a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing escargots.  Great crêpes,  food and atmosphere! Will go back. There were a live 2 men band that added to an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Like many others, I drove by the 'Bernard's Opening Soon' sign for what seemed like months, and thought... Oh, another doomed restaurant, as so many before had come and gone.

But it finally opened!  Yay, a new place in the 'hood.

We have now had dinner there twice, and both times have enjoyed the food and service.  The staff is VERY welcoming and seem genuinely happy you are there.  Both times we have had excellent service, and they were more than helpful and accommodating with a food allergy request.

We have tried:
Ahi appetizer - excellent, and the presentation was great.  It was the first time I have seen the dipping sauce in an egg shell - cool. 
Bufala Mozzarella Caprese - unfortunately not made with buffalo mozzarella, but the group thought it was very good.
Fish and Chips - very light and tasty batter on the fish, great skinny onion rings, typical fries, and to mix it up, battered veggies.  The fry cook had a good read on most everything.
Chinois Chicken Salad -  Husband loved it.  Lots of different flavors, good dressing - not heavy, but enough of it.  Says he would order it again.
NY Steak - just ok, decent but probably would not order it again.
Chicken Milanese - again ok, but huge!  The side of spaghetti was excellent, made me wish I had just ordered a plate of pasta.

Dessert - cake; a chocolate piece of chocolate and more chocolate - they said it was delicious.
A frozen peach hollowed out and filled with sorbet, again going out of their way to cater to an allergy - it was awesome.  

To top the night off, Chef Bernard came out and sang Happy Birthday to me!
Usually, I would have crawled under the table at this point, but he sang with his French accent and who can resist him?! It was great!"}
{"text":"So I read the reviews and checked out the amazing menu for this place  and I had to check it out, well my overall feeling
Is that I might have gone at a bad time and in the wrong day.. We went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon , the hostess was very nice and our server also , we ordered the Caprese appetizer which was very good,  the problem came with our entrees , the Roast beef Thai salad had roast beef that seemed old and had no taste , my girlfriend ordered the mushroom chicken Crepes which I thought were very tasty but she pointed out were over cooked and hard on the ends (I ate them anyway). All said it was just ok and we will give it another shot but maybe for dinner.. Also the music made me wanna curl up in my booth and go to sleep.."}
{"text":"Great food and plating. Diners beware, they charge for grated cheese that you ask for to put over food. Was not informed of this, charged $1.50 for a teeny bit of cheese, used less than half, waitress spilled the rest. I will go back food was great"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and was greeted with a warm ambience. Piano player... seated after a few minutes. Service was good although she misheard my order, vegetarian spinach n artichoke crepes with a side of beurre blanc. She almost brought foie gras instead of beurre blanc... we also had escargot (delicious), crab cakes (perfectly cooked crunchy and soft inside), Caesar salad, California crunch salad?, 3 mignons, filet mignon, wild salmon and everything was delicious.  Very excellent food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous luncheon at this Jewel on Sunset. Forget the chains, treat yourself to a very affordable, gourmet dining experience. First off, the staff are just amazing... Rose makes you feel like a VIP every time. She catered to our little grandbaby who is 11mos old and enjoyed many \"food firsts\" here today. The Caesar Salad is great! We also had the Lucheon NY Strip and it was done perfectly and served with yummy veggies and delicious mashed potatoes. And, the Salmon Flatbread is just light and perfect. The ambiance is welcoming and very comfortable. A special delight, was getting to see and take pictures with the man himself, Chef Bernard. WOW!
Already booked for Annabel's first birthday later this month."}
{"text":"A \"Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole\" vibe. Music of that era (which I enjoy because it reminds me very much of my dad). Sophisticated, yet a comfortable, casual feel. 

Great service! Everyone, including the manager - Roger, was on their A game!
Professional & attentive!

Now let's talk food..
Fiancé started off with the escargot .. Although I was not brave enough to try it he savored every single bite! 

Main dishes were Ribeye Steak Au Fromage Roquefort for me & Herb Crusted Lamb Chops for him. Both came with mashed potatoes and veggies.

My steak being cooked to a medium well/ALMOST well done is what stopped me from giving them 5 stars. 

STILL a good, tender piece of steak!

The lamb chops were very tender and not at all gamy! 

We ended the meal with Tiramisu and the popular Tarte Tartin.

Tiramisu was light and fluffy. The Tarte Tartin was well... tart.. But a great comparison to a good non crusted apple pie with ice cream!

Good ambience, good food, great service!
Definitely recommended if you're in the mood for French!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and nice lunch menu. Breads are great so panini croque is very tasty!! Professional waitstaff and atmosphere. But they need to hire bussers for their lunch rush. It's unfair to have two waitresses that are serving and clearing off tables. 

Will definitely come back for lunch and possibly for dinner or Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and both times I received exceptional service, delicious food, and it was affordable. There is nothing else like it in this area. It's small, but it has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My sister and I stumbled on Bernard's  as we were trying to find the Ethel M's chocolate tour.   What a find!  At the time of our visit (1/29/14) they had only been open a week or so.  It wasn't very busy at all.  The food was fabulous.  I had a grilled chicken salad that had an asian flair to it.  The flavors were blended perfectly and I ate every bit!  My sister had the quiche and simply raved about it.  A true french quiche, creamy and fluffy!   We enjoyed a nice french sauvignon blanc with our meal.  My sister, who is staying in Vegas longer than we were, was able to show off her fluent french w/ the chef and make a date for her and her husband the following week when there will be sweet breads!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the atmosphere is very cute. The food however is not that great. I ordered the chicken and mushroom crepes. It tasted like a can of cream of chicken/mushroom soup inside a crepe. It also came a salad with some type of dressing that was very bland and the salad seem wilted. The worst part was when you ordered a soda they bring you a bottle and pour it over ice and I ended up with flat soda. My husband ordered the island burger and it was good but not worth going back for."}
{"text":"What a quaint little bistro this is! 

We made reservations to dine with some friends for dinner.  There was a nice ambiance in the dining area with a guitarist and singer that played light music during our visit. The restaurant was very welcoming and cozy.

We started off with the Dungeness Crab Cake.  They were good!  Not over the top but still good.   This was served with mixed greens,  At the same time a bread basket was brought out for the table.  It was just ok.  It was kind of mushed and dry.  For my entree I chose the Pan seared white fish in which the waiter was raving about.   I  can see why...  Delicious and tasty!  The garlic white wine sauce smothered the fish.  The pesto mashed potatoes that accompanied were ok.  I wish there was more of a pesto flavor.  

The service here is impeccable.  Our waiter was very attentive.  The other staff which helped with refills were very polite and accommodating.   

Our entire group enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend trying them out! Thanks Bernards!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal here at Bernard's Bistro on Sunset! And yes this new place is the second location for Chef Bernard owner/chef of the Lake Las Vegas location. 

The cuisine is described as California European cuisine. The marquee in front of the restaurant bills it as \"Inspired Fresh Diet\" That's what piqued my interest. From what I get from reading the menu and getting to try some samples of some of the dishes, everything is prepared fresh and for those are calorie conscious, some dishes are prepared with lighter sauces and some Vegetarian dishes too. 

For this visit  it was soup, salad and quiche for me! The Classic Onion Soup was great! It was overflowing of baked Gruyere Cheese and caramelized onions, and cheese in every spoonful of the tasty beef broth. So good!

Next up my Bufala Mozzarella Caprese! It's good, I really like that the balsamic vinaigrette wasn't acidic at all. Real smooth.

Now the Quiche Florentine was something else! Texture wise, the most smooth, silky quiche I have had. A light but creamy cheese sauce topped it. The dish was savory, light, yet fulfilling. It also came with house salad and fresh fruit!! My server forewarned me that I did order plenty of food, she was right! Thing is I did managed to polish off the quiche dish in one sitting. Woot go me! 

....and like if that wasn't enough food...I was asking about other dishes on the menu and asked if they offer them on their lunch menu. ..Yes they do!! A few minutes later my server came over with samples Caribbean Chicken Salad and the Chimichuri sauce for the Argentinean pan roasted chicken. Both now on my list to order in the near future.  Especially the Caribbean Salad. LOVE the Dill Mango Curry dressing.   The general manager came by and introduced himself. Roger said that salad is popular and a favorite at Lake Las Vegas location. 

and then dessert....I ordered the Creme Brulee which is made in house. Fresh and simple vanilla custard. 

Price wise...for me it was fair and in line with the surrounding restaurants in the area.  Put it this way I spent the same amount ($30) for a similar dinner the day before at Macaroni Grill.  I'd much rather come here. Fresh and quality ingredients. Dishes 100x tastier.  It's a no brainer. 

Atmosphere is casual but classy. The furnishings are a bit dated. But they did a good job of refreshing up the place with wall art and white linen covered tables and booths. In the evening your ambient lighting comes from the bright outdoor street lights. And you cant go wrong with Frank Sinatra tunes playing in the background.

Service was impeccable. Everyone was on their A game. I found their staff to be warm and friendly. Chef Bernard popped out to say a quick hello to some regular patrons. What a welcome addition this place is to the neighborhood. I see many lunches and dinners here in the future!"}
{"text":"We wanted a good meal in a quiet setting to have dinner with friends. The restaurant is fairly small, quiet with a pleasant ambiance. Our waiter came very shortly after we were seated to take our drink order. After a somewhat longer than expected he returned to take our meal order. If ahi tuna is on the menu in a nice restaurant, I try to order it. For ahi tuna, to be really good, you need \"sushi quality\" meat. When it is really good, it cuts with a fork and melts in your mouth. The ahi that I was served needed to be cut with a knife and definitely did not melt in my mouth. It came with a side of veggies. The veggies were cold. My wife ordered the rib eye steak. It was a very generous portion and cooked the way she ordered it. The steak was somewhat on the tough side but it had an excellent sauce. Her veggies also were cold. We had a creme brulee for the table. It came with a huge side of whipped cream. Overall, it was OK but not more than that. I ordered coffee at the end of the meal but ended up sending it back because it was served cold. And the service, while the waiter was quite pleasant, was so slow the meal took much longer than expected. I walked in really wanting to like this restaurant but couldn't. Sorry but I will not be going back to give it another chance."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and their food was average. The French onion soup--which is supposed to be light and cheesy ended up being a very heavy dish. The cheese was terribly chewy making for a challenging time with the soup. The fettuccini Alfredo was pretty good. Hard to mess that up. The spicy shrimp linguini could've been better--shrimp wasn't cooked all the way. I supposed it's a nice \"date place\" but for a quick lunch--it's more on the pricier side."}
{"text":"I was so excited when a family member wanted their birthday dinner to happen here. My guy and I had been wanting to try Bernard's since it opened.

Walking in, is pretty interesting. The bistro had a man playing music, and the movie \"Titanic\" was playing on several TV's throughout the restaurant. It also had quite a few titanic themed things around.... Which I was confused by. My cousin and I googled the Titanic, and it's an English ship. 

English ship.... French restaurant. 
Interesting. 

The table is brought bread, which is delicious..Flat out, possibly the best bread I have ever eaten.. My cousins and I agreed on this.

For appetizers, the table ordered a margarita flat bread, escargot, and calamari. 
I didn't dare try the snails. My uncle who did though, said that they were fabulous. The calamari was a tad chewy and tasteless. The flat bread had decent flavor... but no texture. No crunch. 

I ordered the special, Which was lamb and duck breast. I ordered the lamb rare, and the duck medium rare. It was my first time having duck, so, I was a little nervous, and a little excited. I ordered a side of french fries for my 2 year old.

When my meal came. I was confused.
It had about 5 pieces of sliced duck, 2 PETITE lamb chops, some garlic mashed potatoes, 2 different sauces, and 

one slice of RAW red bell pepper
one round slice of carrot
one stem of asparagus
one piece of broccoli. 

I guess this is artistic? 

The lamb was okay. Didn't have a crust on it, the lamb had fat on it, that made it very chewy. The duck was also very chewy. The most tender thing on my plate was mashed potatoes. When I'm paying $60 for a plate, that's sad. 

My daughter's french fries didn't have a \"crunch\" or texture to them either. But, she's two and devoured them. 

Speaking of children, this really isn't the place for them.... because if they play the titanic every night, the last thing you want your kid to possibly see is the car scene, or the drawing scene. 

Kate winslet is beautiful, I just don't want to see her breasts while I'm trying to eat.

Total bill was about $400, for the food that they're serving, eh, I just don't see coming back."}
{"text":"Decent food. Vegetarian crepes lacked flavor. My friend put my pesto on it which helped. I ordered the Pistachio Salmon thinking it would be encrusted with nuts. They forgot the nuts which are supposed to be scattered on top of the fish and then brought me a small amount in a container. Staff was friendly and attentive. Menu selections large and looked reasonably priced. It was my girlfriends actual birthday and it would have been nice to get a free little sample cake or something for her. We had to buy our desserts which were good but seriously?? When I talked to the gal who made my reservation she mentioned a glass of champagne with strawberries. I thought that meant it would be on the house. Nope. Will return (but ask more questions about the preparation of items.) Would recommend Bernard's to others."}
{"text":"Gorgeous location, great food, and some of the best service I've come across in the Henderson area! Restaurant has al fresco seating, a formal dining room with white linen table cloths, and a more casual deli area with a piano. Decor is eclectic, food is superb quality!

Favorite salad is the grilled vegetable roulade, with an amazing ginger beet aioli and the perfect amount of feta cheese- it's a great lunch!
The classic french onion soup and escargot belle epoque are also phenomenally well executed, a must-order for a date night or a group dinner.

Chef Bernard is present at the restaurant and frequently comes out to chat with guests- he is one of the sweetest men around, and very genuine! Same goes for all other employees, high level of professionalism and service found here."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Green Valley.   This place surpasses Sammy pizza (which moved recently).  But better food and service and nearly the same price point.    Roger (the GM) has delivered a great addition to our locals market and cares tremendously to his teams customer service.   And their attention to the  health conscience clientele is very appreciated."}
{"text":"SHOP LOCAL!  That's been my mantra for years.  I always try to avoid the national chains and spend my money at locally owned joints.  Unfortunately, Southern Nevada is overrun by chains and lacks locally owned businesses.

Bernard's is wonderful.  I haven't experienced anything like Bernard's in Green Valley/Henderson.  The food was perfect.  I had the Tuna Tartar and the cheese plate, wife had crab cakes, and my daughter had spaghetti and meatballs.  Everything was delicious.  The cheese was fresh and served with great complimentary items like fruit and nuts.  The crab cakes were really good, the past and meatballs were good too.  Then there was the Tuna Tartar... AMAZING!  Fresh Ahi served with a cucumber salad, sesame crackers, and wasabi.  Sooooo good.

The staff was also great.  They were attentive, but not overbearing.  They all had great attitudes and were as friendly as could be.  

I think the ownership has something special here.  I hope locals will avoid the chains and see how good this place is.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant!  Food, service, ambiance, etc, etc was fabulous."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Bernard's for dinner three times now.  We really enjoy it.  It is a gem in the Green Valley area.  If you are looking for good food, presented beautifully in a comfortable environment with delightful staff, this is your place.  The Ahi Tuna Tartar and Escargot are delicious appetizers.  We haven't had anything we did not enjoy.  We cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Ordered the New York, it was cooked well but the flavor didn't quite match and the mushrooms didn't look fresh.  

The seating was cramped and I was rubbing elbows with my party and it was generally uncomfortable to sit.  

Green valley has quite a few small eateries, but this one is slightly overpriced for the quality of food and seating arrangements."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Best affordable peppercorn steak in town! I've been coming here for a long time and they staff is wonderful as well! A++ If you're lucky you might even get a greeting form the chef, sometimes he comes out and chats with people! It's such a nice cozy atmosphere and everyone is so friendly! :)"}
{"text":"We dropped by today for lunch. My first impression upon walking in was that it felt very homey. They've done a good job making the place feel friendly and comfortable.

We ordered the Escargot, Scottish Salmon Flat Bread and the Argentinian Pan Roasted Organic Chicken Chimichuri. Chef Bernard's escargot comes with a super delicious creamy sauce. You'll want to make sure you have enough bread to sop up all of the sauce with. The salmon flat bread was really good, as was the chicken. 

Stop wondering if you should try this place out. If you like really good food, just go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is on the higher end of my usual price range, but since it was close to my house and new, I wanted to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. The dinner menu was surprisingly deep. They certainly have something for everyone. The portions and the presentation made the higher price point easily justified. Combine that with the friendly staff and live entertainment, it was a wonderful experience. This is one of those places where the waitstaff makes you feel like you're a part of the family. I honestly will go back as much for the staff as I will for the food. Definitely worth a visit. 

NOTE- If you don't like cilantro, the meatloaf will not be for you. It's an interesting recipe that is fairly heavy on cilantro both inside the loaf and as a garnish."}
{"text":"Go here all the time. Very glad they opened one up in GV. The service never fails, and the lunch menu is on point. Try any pasta dishes or seafood dishes they really excel!  the escargot is among the best I've had"}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant.  A few years ago we happened to \"find\" Bernard's Bistro at Lake Las Vegas.  I keep checking online to see if it was still in business and when I started planning this trip to Las Vegas, returning to Bernard's Bistro was high on my list. Thank goodness they have a restaurant closer to the strip.  The food is fabulous.  I feel like there is such passion in the way the food is created.  The broths, the sauces have such depth of flavor.  So amazing. 
We loved Rose.  So full of personality and warmth.  She definitely makes the experience special.  I highly recommend this restaurant and the following items we ordered:
Spicy Shrimp Linguine...you really must try this dish
Seafood Artichoke crepes with lobster sauce...great price, great taste.
Classic Onion soup...the broth is amazing.
The soup of the day, Beef Barley was hearty and full of flavor
Love the bread
I think my favorite dessert was the limoncello dessert.
Wonderful dining experience - we loved it so much we went twice during our short trip to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sauce!!! Must I say
We are originally from California but I got to say that Bernards has the best Bistro.
I really wanted the MY WAY SPECIAL seabass but they were out and only because its that delicious. So I ordered the Scollops and crunchy frog legs and was the Bomb....
Thanks Gerber your awesome as well. 
Great service!!!
 Yes, I will be returning..."}
{"text":"Very impressed.  After a few failed restaurants at this location, I'd bet this one is here to stay.  Their other location is in Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We have not celebrated two birthday lunches here, and both times we left satisfied.

The service and food were both great.  The Onion Soup is to die for!

We definitely will be back in the future. (And not just for birthday celebrations).

Thanks again for making both lunches a hit!!

PS  If you call in advance, you can have the owner sing happy birthday to you in French!!!  Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Bernard's gets high score in my book. Our dinner was delicious! We had the chicken and mushroom crepe with a side salad and the lamb chops with potatoes and asparagus. The side salad had just the right amount of dressing, the crepe was hearty like comfort food. Did I mention the piping hot sourdough baguette with butter? Service was attentive and professional. A wonderful pairing of white and red wines were suggested with our meals. The live music wad delightful. We were thoroughly satisfied so why stop there?  We ended on a sweet note of creme brûlée and chocolate ganache cake. Fabulous! Now if they can just get the lighting right, they would be perfect."}
{"text":"Came with my boyfriend for lunch and we were both surprised. Fresh, sophisticated, yet casual.. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came to Bernard's with Dyanna L and Jessie B after an Elite event was postponed last minute.  What a great plan B!  Bernard's Bistro had been on my list to try for at least a couple years.  They were pretty busy I thought for a weeknight.  We were seated right away.  Our server was great.  Never felt rushed when we took awhile to order because we were chatting.  There were so many great sounding options.  I ended up ordering spicy shrimp linguini.  I loved it, except it wasn't spicy at all.  Still delicious though.  I'm glad I finally got made it here.  Looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place made me feel like I was sailing on an antique ship. I feel like that's the vibe they were going for. Good food, decent wine selection, friendly staff. I got that chicken schnitzel dish and opted to have it with mashed potatoes instead of pasta the second time. Oh, cause I've been there twice now because it's close to me and I'm a hungry gal. I had it with pasta the first time and thought wtf, this should be paired with creamy heavenly mashed potatoes ya know? All the desert is delicious. I had the tiramisu with ice cream and I'd prob get it again. I think our party got a lil drunk and loud cause we're classy like that. Good time had by all."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. I love love love it here. Delicious, friendly staff and creme brûlée. I am in heaven."}
{"text":"FABULOUS FOOD! The chef is extraordinary! French Bon Appetite, we will definitely be back! Low calorie, the presentation is beautiful. Small, intimate and as good as any 5 star restaurant, Ive ever been too! Find this place, go out of your way, I'm bringing my best friend next time we get to hang."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a local place to go and have a nice, light, fun lunch. We remembered driving by Bernard's Bistro a few times and wanting to try it out. We finally got the chance to go in today, and I have to say it was pretty great!
 
The ambiance of the place what that of fine dining (we did not expect this and walked in with jeans and sneakers). The waiting staff was dressed in button-up shirts and there was calming music playing in the background. Their walls are covered in artwork, and they have a pretty decked out bar off to one side of the restaurant. The prices, however, are very reasonable considering the atmosphere.
 
We started off with our drinks - they actually have a wide selection of hot teas which I was pretty excited about. They also seem to have had a good selection of wines, but we did not have any offered to us. Not sure if that has to do with us looking young for our age or they just forgot, but it didn't matter too much to us at the time as we weren't really in the mood for it anyway. They also served complimentary, WARM bread! So comforting!
 
We then had the soup of the day, which was Chicken and Rice. It sounds bland but it honestly was super delicious. I honestly cold have had a whole meal's worth of this soup and been super satisfied. I'll definitely be having this again.
 
We ordered the Bufala Mozarella Caprese for our appetizer, which was good, but not up to our expectations. I would have preferred the portions been a little smaller and that they used actual balsamic vinegar versus their sauce-like alternative, but we still packed the leftovers to bring home with us.
 
We were starting to get pretty full by the time our main course came out. I would like to note the wait time between the courses was a bit long, so this may have contributed to us getting this way, but the preparations were lovely and the waitress acknowledged the time without us saying anything and said she just wanted us to enjoy each course.
 
For our main dishes, I ordered the Panini San Remo Italian Sandwich with the House salad and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Caesar Wrap with the Potato Salad. The sandwiches were split in halves so we were able to trade halves with each other. I have no complaints about either of these courses. They were both super good, and my boyfriend must have fallen in love with that wrap. He went on and on about how great it was, and I have to agree with him.
 
We were debating on dessert because of how full we have gotten at this point (we barely got through our sandwiches and got them wrapped to go), but when the waitress mentioned their Blueberry Crumbled Cheesecake.. we couldn't say no. We ordered the cheesecake and then some Crème Brule. The cheesecake was just the perfect amount of tart and richness. The Crème Brule was good but it was thicker than what I was used to. Each dessert was served next to some whipped cream and strawberries, which was a nice touch.
 
We will definitely be coming back to Bernard's for lunch in the future, and we are very interested to try out their dinner menu. You definitely get the fine dining experience without the fine dining price. Very impressed :)"}
{"text":"We got engaged last evening. Rhonda was our server and helped make the night even more special. The Ahi Tartar and the Beats and Goat Cheese got us started and they were excellent. We shared the Lamb Chops and finished with the Tiamisu. These are items that you've got to try!"}
{"text":"Since the server will be your first impression of the restaurant, when you go there, ask for Rose. She is very knowledgeable of the menu, personable, gives good suggestions, and is a hell of a lot of fun. Really great personality, and an excellent waitress. 

On to the appetizers. We had the Caprese salad. The pesto on it was good, but the tomatoes could have used a pinch of salt. (I added the salt, and all was well again.) But the balsamic reduction they drizzle on it... unnnnnngh. I just want to drink a jar of it. Sweet and tangy, thick and gooey, that balsamic reduction was awe-inspiring. 

My friend had the NY Strip au poivre. (No, I can't spell French things. Sue me.) The meat was cooked perfectly. The red wine sauce, to me, was too sweet, and they could have used a different type of mushroom, but, overall, he was happy. 

I had the chicken and mushroom crepes. And, if I hadn't been very full and satisfied by the time I got to the end of the crepes, I would have had TWO orders of the chicken and mushroom crepes. I will probably sneak out to have an order of them tomorrow. They were really scrumptious. 

The only two \"dings\" I can give the place is that the pomme frites were bland and flavorless, and the mushroom thing from above, but those were very minor. (For example, I was in no position to eat the fries even if they WERE good, 'cuz I was very full of crepe. (See what I did there?) ) 

Yeah. Definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Today was my second lunch time visit. The manager sat us and was very friendly. 

By coincidence, I had the same server both visits. The first time was during the week. She did ok with service both time up until it was time for the check. Both times she made us wait forever! The first time my friend was on her lunch hour so this was majorly inconvenient. Today, I was with my daughter on the way to the mall. We waited 25 minutes AFTER finishing our meal to get the check. 

My daughter had a California Club sandwich and I ordered Quiche Lorraine. On my prior visit I ate a chipotle chicken wrap. The food was not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. 

I do agree with the Yelper who talked about the decor's identity crises. It looks like the photos of the food were left behind from the noodle shop that was in the location previously."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time tonight after driving by and seeing a write up about it.  We absolutely adore it!  The food was unique and amazing, the service spot on (not overwhelming but perfectly attentive) and the ambience perfectly sweet.  It is definitely our new date spot! We are picky customers and this one should not be missed.  Bernard also came out and said hello, that sweet touch made the experience even more genuine."}
{"text":"I hate having to lessen my star rating for Bernard's, as I have a personal liking for the Chef. However, I cannot justify a 4 or 5 star review after my most recent experience. 
My bf, stepson and I came here on a Monday night around 7:00 PM for dinner. It was steady, I have seen it more packed, and have also been here at a slower time as well.
We were sat in the back corner, which is totally fine with me. But it seemed that our waitress kept forgetting about us because we were out of view. We watched as people who were sat after us, receive their bread, drinks, and food first. Even though we ordered first. 
Now I never had seen this woman before, and I have been here at least 8 times since the opening. She may have been new. But we waited for everything. Not an average wait time either. Like we sat with our menus closed for 8-10 minutes before she took our order. The waitress who we always see there, actually had to go point out to the newbie, \"hey your table is ready to order\". 
Then when we got dessert, it took SO LONG for it be brought out. We ordered tiramisu and cheesecake. Other than slice it, what could have possibly took so long? 
Again the place was steady, but by NO MEANS slammed. I was so annoyed watching half the restaurant get great service by our normal girl, while we drooled over others food. 
Now the food was still up to par. Beautiful presentation, and worth giving Bernard's another go. But I hope they are not on a downhill spiral. What happen to Roger, the manager making his rounds? What happen to the hostess? They traded her in for the crappy waitress with a fake smile? 
Uh, step your game up guys!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try Bernard's because of the reviews posted earlier but it was a big disappointment. We went on a Monday at 6 pm. There were only 7 other diners. Our server greeted us with a drink question and never once mentioned the dinner special. We ordered a Caesar salad which took over 20 mins to make it to our table. I ordered the chicken schnitzel which was thickly coated in Panko breadcrumbs and very bland. The side of spaghetti was also bland. I don't think the chef or cook once used salt or any spice at all. My husband ordered the cannelloni which had a very odd taste. All in all I would not recommend this restaurant. I gave it two stars for ambience."}
{"text":"The menu looks, superficially, like your normal three star, with commonly found appetizers, etc. The food actually as depth, and perhaps will not only be better, but very nicely presented as well.

I had an ahi appetizer, and it was completely fabulous; I would have been stuffed had I eaten more. Coffee was great. My companions really like their selections, too. Again, not only great food but excellent presentation in a formal dining situation, with ten of us in a party. It's not $$ as others state, it's $$$ but worth it, IMHO."}
{"text":"I do not know how anyone could give them anything other than 5 stars....if I were to take a star away it could be location...everything about the place deserved a better location but after 5 minutes inside my disappointment of venue had totally disappeared.  Also, it says it is French, well it may lean towards French or elegant country French but not your saucy, skimpy and tres expensive French.  As for cost it is just a bit above $$ and worth every cent!!"}
{"text":"I would really give this place 4 1/2 Star! Our dining experience was YUM, YUM, and YUM! The atmosphere of the place is nice and clean. Just a little over done with decor on the walls, but I guess something to look at. The service was very friendly from the time you walk in to the time you leave. We asked our server for suggestions  since there were so many menu choices. The food was delish! I tasted what everyone had and boy...Yummy! From soup (onion soup & gazpacho), appetizer (farmed beers and goat cheese), entree (lamb chops, Brazilian chicken, c? salad), and dessert (forest fruit tart). Even the cappuccino! You can't go wrong. 

Reason I took off a 1/2 star was my friend ask for a cocktail, but they only serve beer and wine. Also, when our entrees came out, only the hot entrees came out together and I had to wait another five to ten minutes for my salad entree to come out later. Which I guess they wanted to make sure it's fresh?

Overall, the dining experience is definitely worth returning and trying everything else on the menu. Did I also mention, it's reasonably PRICED!  This location is known to be jinxed.  I hope it stays! We need a place like this in Henderson."}
{"text":"Bernard's Bistro is a 10 min walk from my abode. As others have said, there have been many food places occupying this space recently. I hope this place stays. I was very impressed with the food and ambiance. Had lunch with two others. One had Caribbean chicken salad, one had a chicken wrap and I had the Express Lunch.. Cup of delish beef barley, a small mixed greens with a house vinegerette ( a violet purple dressing? !!), and a tuna avocado on a fresh soft bagette. Food well prepared, server was very friendly. I took off a star for two reasons. 1) it was a bit loud and the restaurant was at best 1/2 full. 2) while the service was friendly the food took a bit of time to be delivered, and the waiter cleared the plate a bit too quickly. Two of us were still enjoy bread when the plates were removed. I can't wait to go back for dinner, hopefully soonish."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with my husband this evening. We arrived around 6:30 on a Friday night and were greeted nicely, even though we didn't have a reservation. The food was fabulous!!! We were also treated to live music provided by a lovely woman (she sings here on Friday and Monday nights). The service here is great and my dinner was really tasty!!! I absolutely LOVED the Gazpacho!!! Make a reservation and request one of their lovely booths! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Sophisticated atmosphere with a variety of lunch options. I tried the pistachio salmon in lavender wine sauce=cooked perfectly and beautiful presentation. Yay! For another option on my side of the valley!"}
{"text":"this place is everything it inspires to be. let's break it down. Atmosphere is clean, cozy and relaxing old school music. decor is a little too much. a lot of clutter but doesn't necessarily affect the experience. food was really good and priced well. tonight we ordered escargot, ribeye, lamb chops, tiramisu and tarte tatin. This was my first time trying escargot and it was phenomenal! I think that was my favorite dish. Ribeye was a touch over cooked but it was still tender and tasty. Lambchops were perfectly cooked and delish! Tiramisu was fluffy and not to sweet. Tarte tatin tasted a little sour. I would've not eaten it if it wasn't for the gelato that came with it but our server and manager said it's the best seller. Now let's talk service, everyone was friendly, smiling and it seem like everyone's enjoying themselves. Whole staff was attentive even the manager(Roger) stopped by every table more than once. My family really enjoyed this place and the hospitality is top notch. Only reason Im giving 4 stars is because the ribeye was too well when asked for medium rare and tarte tatin was sour. customer service A+++"}
{"text":"First time to this quaint bistro--the atmosphere was great, had live music that was wonderful.  The white table clothes and napkins add to the wonderful ambiance.  The wine selection is okay--some selections.  Initially, started with the escargot--very nice presentation, the escargot were served with a tomato, mushroom and bacon infused creamy garlic and parsley butter--very good.  Moved on to the mozzarella caprese salad--presentation was good, on the large side with lettuce.  The mozzarella seemed rubbery and not fresh  and the tomatoes tasted on the under ripe side--hard and no flavor.  Moved on to the classic onion soup--this was presented very well with lots of onions and cheese--very good flavor.  Main course was herb crusted lamb chops.  The presentation looked very nice, but the lamb was tough, the herb crusted coating was more in line with a \"shake n bake\" coating and not very well prepared.  The garlic infused mashed potatoes were alright--nothing special.  Moved on to the cheese plate--was nicely presented and had four varieties of cheeses, served with some fruit and crackers.  The desert was an apple tarte tatin--this was not presented well, the puff pastry was flat and soggy, the apples were more in line with brown applesauce and the plate was overflowing with whipped cream--not tasty at all.  Not sure if this was an off night or if this was standard fare, based on the previous Yelp reviews.  I was not impressed with the service--seemed to have three waiters/waitresses and one back waitress and they appeared to be overwhelmed and not interested in serving.  Will try again another time to see if any improvements have been made."}
{"text":"Tonight was my boyfriends and I first time here at Bernard's bistro. I had to say it was better than I expected. I knew it was always busy so I was worried we would have to wait for a table or have a reservation, but the manager was right up front to greet us with a big smile. He did ask if we had a reservation and we said no, he said that was quite alright and showed us right to a nice booth. I had the spinach eggplant roll with the side salad. It was great! My boyfriend had the spinach artichoke crepe. He really liked it. I ordered the white Zinfandel to drink and the waiter brought it over promptly. He also showed me another wine I might like and let me sample. Overall this was a good experience here. Our waiter was friendly and the food was superb. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place. We live in NW Las Vegas so we don't get to Henderson very much but we were going to see the new Star Wars movie at the Galaxy and decided to have some dinner beforehand. My wife found the restaurant on Yelp and once again we were not disappointed.
The French onion soup is great. I had the burger it was very juicy and tasty. My wife loved her chicken dish. We may have to make extra trips to the SE part of town more often."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but it was just ok. Went there for a Sunday brunch before church and were a little disappointed. Service was good but food was just average and the decor a little cluttered. Not a bad place for a local spot, maybe we just went at a bad time, they had just opened for the day. Will probably try another day, maybe a little later in the afternoon next time."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for her birthday brunch. She loves the place. It looks like she decorated it.... Prices were decent. Food was pretty good. They had female singing in the dining room. Not very accommodating for kids, we had my young nieces with us and they couldn't find anything to eat."}
{"text":"If you want great local service and a manager who truly cares about you I highly recommend coming here! The food is great and live music gives it a great touch. Every night has a different theme giving it a nice touch! It's great to see a good Restraunt right down the street."}
{"text":"Food is still 5 stars, however recent menu  price increases have caused repeat business to noticeably wane. Way too costly for a neighborhood diner.  Downgraded on that basis."}
{"text":"This review is for the Bernard's Bistro on
2021 W Sunset Rd
Henderson, NV  89014
United States

The food is always delicious. I judge a brunch by how good the Eggs Benedict is. Bernard's Bistro makes a MEAN smoked salmon version. That's why I gave the restaurant five stars( or maybe the two glasses of Prosecco I consumed is talking here?!) joking aside, the food, the service and the LIVE Jazz music makes this place a winner!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than 5 stars to this restaurant.  We went tonight, with my girlfriend and her husband, and my husband.  My girlfriend is vegetarian,so we have to pick a restaurant that serves those items plus a regular menu.  This was perfect My girlfriend ordered the beet salad, and a vegetarian wrap.   My husband, and her husband ordered the Chicken Milanese. Her husband, who loves onion soup, ordered it and said it could be a meal in itself.  I sincerely hope this restaurant is successful.Wonderful food, great ambiance, and lastly excellent service!!!  The hostess was just beautiful and most proficient at her job.  Rhonda, our server,was the best ever!  I will ask for her the next time we go.  What a wonderful dinner, so close to my house.  Kudos, to you all."}
{"text":"It's a popular restaurant that just opened up next to E-strings. I ordered a crab cake appetizer and lamb chops. The service was very good and the venue is general is nice, open and clean. It's just unfortunate the food isn't up to par compared to everything else. 
The menu sounds great on paper, not on execution. The lamb chops were cooked well but the herb crust doesn't mesh well with the meat. It had the same taste consistency of a bland fried pork cutlet. The garlic mashed potatoes served with it fared even worse as a flavorless mush. It's just a run-of-the-mill restaurant. There's nothing bad about Bernard's Bistro but it isn't solid enough to worth recommending. The infrastructure and restaurant itself is ran well. The issue may just be the chef and the cooking. Would definitely hope their food improves. I would like to give them another chance maybe later.
There's nothing special about Bernard's Bistro, which appeals to more conservative seniors in their late 40s and 50s. This would be more appropriate somewhere in Anthem for the retired.

TLDR: Henderson's lackluster answer to Summerlin's swanky Echo & Rig (without the butcher shop and pizzaz)."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is excellent. I wish there were more than 5 stars--because this place deserved it. The presentation is extraordinary and the food is even better. So many delicious dishes, it's hard to pick just one. We came here for a family party and they made us feel right at home--we even got to thank the chef personally. The filet mignon was so tender, you could cut it with a fork. The salmon was excellent and the pesto mashed potatoes melted in my mouth.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and anyone. Try it out for yourselves, you won't be disappointed! 
Roger, the manager, is on top of everything; he tended to our every need and made us feel part of the family. I will definitely be back every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend tried Bernards Bistro on our last dinner date.  The only thing that was wonderful was our waiter from Guatemala.  We didnt enjoy our dinner at all from the greasy appetizer to our main entree with no real taste especially the filet mignon wellington."}
{"text":"the food is ok but I'm taking a star away because they don't have a croque madame for brunch.  unheard of for a \"French bistro\".  I had the bistro burger with frites.  cooked nicely with high quality meat.  the bun could have been a little fresher but overall a decent meal.  dessert sucked.  we shared a \"key-lime cheesecake\". between 3 of us, 75% of it was left on the plate.  it was a plain cheesecake (and not close to fresh).  the \"key-lime\" aspect was a neon green jelly like substance squirted on top and around the cheesecake. hidioso."}
{"text":"Let's try this with bullet points: 
- The multiple Eiffel Towers:  Lose the Eiffel Tower wrapped in fake greenery and adorned with Christmas lights...half of which don't work.  It's also awkwardly placed.  Take the glittery gold 3 foot high one out to the desert with a 6-pack and a shotgun. 
- Either get better lighting or keep the fluorescent DMV lighting off.  They were flickering the whole time I was there and gave me a nervous tick.  
- If you're going to say you're French, OWN IT and don't try to pander to the world by offering Indian, Italian, American, Moroccan and Japanese (ok...maybe sushi wasn't actually on the menu)
- Your signature beet and goat cheese salad?  The beets had the same flavor, shape and even indentations of the can from which they came.  Beets are roundish and have flavor.  Masking canned beets with goat cheese hurt my feelings. 
- A waitress should never ask if you mind if your dinner comes out a bit late because another table is being needy.  
- GREAT, STUPENDOUS mashed potatoes...but I have horrible taste in what good mashed potatoes look like...so I might be off there.  
- I also really liked the way the Caesar salad was plated...very cool. 

Highly recommended if you have a sense of humor and it's not an important business dinner."}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review and it is because this place is fantastic!!!! What a meal! I had the ribeye and pesto mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked to perfection and the pesto made the mashed potatoes the best I've ever had. My mom had the chef's special: Chilean sea bass. Her meal was even better than mine if that is even possible. It melted in your mouth and I could drink the sauce by itself. I've been to some great restaurants like n9ne steakhouse and il mulino and I feel like this place ranks up there with them (for a great price). We also had a great creme brûlée, it wasn't the best I've ever had, but was still creamy and delicious. Besides the amazing food, the service was outstanding! We had the pleasure of being served by Danny! I hate when I ask a waiter what they're favorite dish is and they say everything. Danny made sure to tell me his favorites and recommended what sides would be best with our meals. He was very attentive and genuinely nice. The highlight was when Chef Bernard came to thank us for coming to his restaurant! He was so sweet and humble and made us feel like a million bucks. Whoever is reading this... Do yourself a favor and try this place out! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Our go to spot, food and service is always spot on. Shrimp dish at lunch is amazing, salmon cooked perfectly and a great wine selection. Enjoy live lounge music while dining."}
{"text":"I should have known it was going to be bad when I pulled up to see a model of the Titanic bursting from the wall, with an equally tall Eiffel Tower resting atop. My gut said \"Run!\" but I wanted to try a dinner at a new spot.

Over 1,500 people lost their lives on that tragic journey from Liverpool to New York, and this meal made me wish, just for a moment, that my ancestors had been aboard that ship too. I would have never been born, and this night at the Bistro would have never taken place.

My personal feelings about the decor are many. The combination of Sinatra singing with the Titanic decor and French decor was like a riddle. \"How do these all fit together?\" I still do not know. The art on the wall was jumbled, to say the least. Poster board was prevalent. Pencil lines used to align signs were still hilariously visible. The cherry on the top was the Eiffel Tower sitting near the back of the restaurant. Too tall for the restaurant, it extended into an empty recessed light fixture. It was also wrapped in a lighted Christmas garland, which was a bold choice for August.

Given all this, the prices on the menu would have been appropriate if the food were not standard fare, prepared badly. Bread was served with hard, cold butter, obviously sliced from a block of butter like the one you have in your fridge.

The burger I received was at the right temperature, on a appetizing bun. I thought things were going to turn around until I took a bite. The burger tasted like the surface of the gas grill that cooked it. I felt like a iceberg punctured my soul. I was beaten down. The gas taste was overwhelming, and I didn't finish the meal. The price tag tied to this was nothing short of insulting.

Stay away."}
{"text":"We went for dinner for our first time on 5/19. It was frank Sinatra night. They played all his songs and had a special menu. We shared the crab cakes. I had the sea bass on top of pesto mashed potatoes and my husband had the hamburger (he's into simple food). I was surprised there were 2 big crab cakes, not just one. It had 3 sauces (all seperated) and all were delish. The sea bass was amazing! It had a lobster wine sauce on it and if I closed my eyes it was like I was eating a tender lobster. My husband enjoyed his hamburger very much. We also had the carrot cake and blood orange mousse for dessert. The carrot cake was good. The mousse was excellent. Even though the prices seem pricy,I felt the food was very well worth the cost. We'll definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Despite having reservations we weren't seated for 20 minutes.  The manager did come over and apologize and offer us drinks which was nice but that didn't get is seated any faster.  They tried to seat us in the \"overflow section\" next to he lady who plays the keyboard and sings but it was cramped and noisy.  When I went to order a sandwich I had seen on the restaurant's website menu as available for dinner I was told it wasn't a dinner item after all.  The waiter insisted there was a salad version on the menu, but he was mistaken.  I ordered the Thai Roast Beef Salad and the dressing and greens were good but the roast beef was just average. The pickled vegetables on top were too pungent, I just moved them to the side.  They did not cook my husband's burger medium well, but brought it medium rare.  The bread they brought was good.  Overall, I was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Bernard's Bistro is adorable. Tucked between an old karaoke bar, a pool cleaning shop and a gas station, the little bistro is completely out of place. However the view, or lack of view, does not stop guests from sitting outside around a bucket of wine on a nice day. \"Quaint,\" is probably the best way to describe the inside. 

Cajun fried calamari- Too many fried onions compared to the calamari. Not worth it! 
Cannelloni- A little too beefy? in taste for me. I can't think of a better way to describe it... My family thought it was perfect!
Brazilian stuffed chicken breast- The waitress recommended ordering it with a side of shrimp, which I recommend doing :) 
California Club Sandwich- My favorite out of the three dishes we ordered. There was enough for the three of us to share. 

The fresh bread they have is amazing. Live music for lunch on Sunday!"}
{"text":"This place surpassed our expectations! Service was above and beyond thanks to our hostess who gave us the warmest welcome EVER, and our server (Rhonda)! She lit up the entire restaurant with her personality and attentiveness! The manager (Roger) was so personable we can't wait to go back. Las Vegas needs to fallow this place as an example if they want to be successful in the art of food and service."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and really enjoyed the food each time. It's also close to home and I love a good restaurant without the drive to the Strip once in awhile.

They have a wide dinner menu selection which I love since I am a more adventurous eater than my husband. The three petite mignon with three sauces offers a nice variety of flavors and is a nice light meal. The Brazilian stuffed chicken was very flavorful and the sauce it comes with is rich and flavorful. I loved the way the flavors worked together with the pistachio salmon that is served with pesto mashed potatoes. Another dish with a creamy, rich sauce that made me want to devour every last bite.

We came here with friends for Easter brunch awhile back and everything was perfect. We made a reservation since they do get busy for special occasions. The service was great and we all took the recommendation for white wine sangria from the waitress. I normally get red wine sangria, but the white wine sangria here is delicious. We all enjoyed our food and they did a great job of providing quality food and service even on a busy day.

I also have to mention that on the lunch menu they have a chicken salad with curry dressing that is to die for. It's a large dish that is packed with flavor."}
{"text":"Although the service was outstanding. The tuna tar tar and escargot fabulous. Do not ever order the filet. Just an awful piece of meat. The manager did comp us desert but that did not make up for the bad meat. I am on he fence about returning."}
{"text":"Another Henderson gem in my part of town! Without having the pleasure of experiencing the Lake Las Vegas location, this was a dining risk that paid off.
Let's start with the casually elegant dining area accented by a baby grand piano and ultra friendly greeting by hosts and staff. Live music on Tuesday and other day. Linen tableclothed seating outside gave us a reminder of the al fresco dining that will be especially enticing in the warmer weather.
Our server, Rose was quite attentive & friendly. She is a credit to the fine dining industry and the art of upselling..but she is so adorable, we don't mind at all! They recommended the sea bass (which is one of my favorites) but sadly, they were out the first time we came in so Rose recommended the Ahi with a side of shrimp scampi. Sold. The presentation of the ahi was beautiful and served with pesto mashed...it was a relief to me to not have the green mashed be wasabi. The ahi itself could have been more seasoned on the crust.
The side of scampi was the best part and I came back and made a meal of just the scampi last night. The sauce was amazing and paired with their fresh, hot bread made for an orgasmic experience not to be missed by anyone! Bernard's scampi sauce has a body to it that is missing in a lot of other restaurants. It's more than just melted butter with garlic and lemon. They make it with love and attention.
I think after coming back to earth, the rest of my family had a pasta dish and a flatbread. My wife on our first visit had the 3 cuts of filet mignon with 3 sauces. Good, but she would have preferred the whole filet with one sauce for $5 less. Last night, she ordered the arrabiata pasta that was bright and fresh. The sauce was perfect with roasted peppers and just the right amount of heat.
The entertainment, though my wife and daughter (and the rest of the dining patrons from the cast of Cocoon) seemed to enjoy the Frank Sinatra impersonator,  was a bit too loud for my taste. I know now to avoid Bernard's on Tuesday if I want a quiet dinner.
The service and graciousness of the staff along with the excellent food will make Bernard's our new regular spot."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to dining at Bernard's. I passed this place several times in my neighborhood and have been hoping for a local French joint in the area. I found it! But..it was not all that great.

The food was subpar, I had the escargot, which were good but anyone can make good escargot with butter and bacon. Next, the salad dressing was bland and salad overall was not satisfying. Measly vegetable side for the entree, could be much better. It looked like steamed vegetables out of a frozen bag. The steak itself could have used more seasoning. 
Also, I asked for just a crepe by itself and they could not do that. Why? There are three crepe entrees on the menu, why not just cook off one plain for a side?

Language barrier with servers (no it's not French). 

Wine was great though, and good prices on wine as well. 

Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more for crepes for lunch or just had wine and cheese.

Creme brulee was excellent.

Overall, for the price and concept, it's just okay, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Went to BB as I was excited to try it out.  Was totally disappointed.  Not only was the menu scattered and not cohesive nor was it French, Italian, etc., rather a hodge podge, but my husband ordered the rib eye and it was filled with fat and played with a mound of what appeared to be gravy, almost as if the cook was covering up the $25 steak.  Our vegetables were nearly raw and neither of our food was properly seasoned.  The cheese plate was great but the rest was extremely disappointing. The decor was absolutely whacky!  Won't be backed and feel ripped off!"}
{"text":"We (unintentionally) came on the very first day! My family lives near. But it was great! When it comes down to the food, it was delicious. And service was nice. 
There was a little bit of a weird smell when we walked in, but I forgot about it later. 
Very European, sophisticated menu. So I would definitely recommend to give it a try. 

It's cool to see more privately-owned businesses in Vegas (haha, I think it's privately-owned, at least). 

I know it was only the first day, but if they had umbrellas or romantic lamps outside I would have really liked to enjoy the weather on the patio. But inside was nice, very European (sometimes there was background music, sometimes it was off... I like having music to talk, but that's just me).

I had the classic burger, it was soo good mmm. I had bites of the other dishes and they were delicious, it's just up to your personal taste on what to try. But the burger. Yumm. 

Hopeful to see what happens w/this business. 

Ohh and this cool grandpa (the chef!... I assume) walked around in his chef wardrobe greeting people and being nice. 

Good feel."}
{"text":"First time here...have passed this place many times and it is not hard to find, but it is located in a place that you can easily drive past and miss.   We decided based on Yelp reviews to try this place as we wanted something different.  

We started with a beet salad which was not bad, the portion was good for two people to share and it was very tasty.  We had the salmon and the Ribeye as these are dishes we like to try for comparison, the portion of the salmon was ok, it was not the biggest I have seen but also not the smallest, it was average.  The Ribeye was good but the piece did have a lot of fat so you were looking for the meat.  For the price it is very very close to almost not being worth it because the steak is not that thick and like I said, there was a lot of fat on it and it not the kind of fat that you can eat.

It was cooked well and we enjoyed our experience.  There is music there almost every night so the staff and ambiance were above the top.  It definitely made up for the food and I am not talking about the taste, I am talking about the fine line of price versus quantity.  

This is a place I would recommend for everyone to try at least once and leave your review on your experience.  Because of the selection of items on the menu, we will go  back again and bring some other folks with us so I can get their opinion and input on the food.

Again, quality was AWESOME, quantity was riding the line as far as portion but overall it was good.

I will see how this next visit goes and update, but I do recommend you try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Had the escargot, cheese plate, onion soup and all were amazing. They have vouvray by the glass which is always a plus. The menu has so many great sounding items. Service was good. Will be back."}
{"text":"Back for business lunch. Food was great...Service was excellant..
CONGRADULATIONS on turning a location where many restaurants have tried and failed into a winner. Can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to learn that a quality restaurant was finally opening at this spot on Sunset Road that has been many different restaurants over the years.  Dined there  Saturday evening, March 8. Nice to see that the place was busy with activity. But as soon as I walked in there was an overpowering smell of ammonia. I immediately said to myself that no matter how good the food was, I would never return. Well I guess I got used to the disinfectant smell while dining on fantastic food and wine. The margarita flat bread was outstanding (topped with fresh greens), and the steak au poive with pomme frites as close to what I've had in France. Our waitress deserves to be in the running of best waitress of 2014 (if such an award exists). 

There is an outdoor eating area and I am looking forward to returning there. My only suggestion is that they make this area \"warmer looking\" as the façade of the restaurant itself is not attractive. As Spring in Vegas arrives, an outdoor dining area will attract those who want to dine under the stars, and creating an inviting ambiance in which to do so would be most welcome!"}
{"text":"I'm super excited to see the extensive menu for this place! I will definitely need to come back to try some of the dinner specials! They have a lot of fish dishes that sound wonderful! We were impressed with everything that we tried here! Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant about 4 days after it opened. In spite of a couple of minor hiccups which I attribute to newness I am giving this restaurant 5 stars. The food was delicious, the service very good, and the menu was inventive. 

Our waiter seemed new to the profession but was friendly and helpful. Other staff though seemed to be very experienced. I am fairly certain that will all even itself out. The décor was a little frenetic between it's ode to music, movies, France, and a little Titanic but I understand they did themed dinners at the restaurant at Lake Las Vegas so they may have something similar planned for this location.

We started with the escargot which came in a traditional garlic butter with an addition of tomatoes and bacon. Neither my husband or I had had it that way and it was delicious. My husband got the shrimp salad sandwich which was beautiful and light. I had the salmon in lavender sauce which quite honestly is some of the best salmon I have ever had. It was very savory and the pesto mashed potatoes were a perfect compliment. We finished up with crème brulee which had the added surprise of the custard being caramel. My favorite desert with the addition of my favorite flavor. Yum! 

I am very much hoping that Bernard's will break the curse of this location because I hope to enjoy many meals there and Henderson, if not Las Vegas is sorely in need of restaurants with affordable French cuisine."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot! They have a great wine selection and outdoor seating as well.  Their French onion soup and their bread n butter are perfection!  The other menu items I have tried, mainly salads and sandwiches have also been great. I really like that this restaurant would be a good fit for many different occasions - Lunch or brunch with family or friends or significant other, wine date, romantic dinner, etc. I also love that they have been very accommodating when bringing my little guy. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ate here before and rated service and food a 4 but this time the service was just ok, calamari rubbery, rib eye steak had lots of grissel and very chewy. We tried but couldn't eat it. They took the entree off the check which was nice. Might try another time, hopefully it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"I went with the Hubs for dinner on April 25th. The staff was very welcoming and 
friendly. It's great when the manager comes over and does a table visit, to check 
on your dining experience. The food was delicious. I has sea bass and the 
Hubs had steak. The service was excellent and the food was plated 
beautifully. I look forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"A delightful dining experience!  I had calamari and marguerite flatbread.  My wife had gazpacho and Caesar salad.  All were creatively presented.  The baguettes were a welcome accompaniment.  The decor is interesting.  The only thing that was missing was a full bar; only wine and beer are available.  All in all, a hearty recommendation."}
{"text":"What a find.  Great lunch specials include soup of the day, salad with mixed lettuce,  great bread, Coffee is so good. The dinner menu is spectacular.  From Italian to 
Tajine .... Great service, really nice atmosphere.  Dessert to die for."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and an amazing menu! Used to be out at Lake Las Vegas. Glad to find them again. Fabulous fine dining in a casual atmosphere at reasonable prices for superior quality food. Must come back on a regular basis!!!"}
{"text":"Bernard's Bistro is a great little place with delicious California French food. The portions are reasonable and their side salad with exquisite dressing makes the visit awesome! The wait staff was very attentive and kind. Overall, a lovely find as new residents in LV!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and environment ! Had the crepes and creme brûlée. Was also entertained by the Sinatra wannabe. Would highly recommend you try it! Excellent service also!"}
{"text":"Fairly disappointed. I ordered a burger and the flavor a didn't mesh well, at least to me. I ordered it medium rare and it came out medium well. The meat was dry. Service was decent, but nothing spectacular. Hugo was my server, and he asked me if my burger was good. I told him it was alright and expected him to ask what was wrong, but he didn't.  I wouldn't have been as disappointed if I had not paid $16 for a burger."}
{"text":"Please let everyone know this place is NOT closed! Chef Bernard sold the restaurant to a friend and it was renamed CBs Legacy, short for Chef Bernard's Legacy. Same menu, same decor, same staff! Don't stay away...it even uses the same phone number as before!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bernard's for her birthday and we were pleasantly surprised!   The staff were great and the entertainment even sang happy birthday to my wife. The food was incredible!   We would really like to keep this a locals secret but, once the word gets out, I think it will be difficult to get reservations during the week. Don't pass this place up. You will regret it if you do!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time and fell in love with the decor, staff, and of course food.  The live piano player also is a very nice enhancement to dinner!   We're coming back Saturday with two other people and will probably come back regularly.   Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"MY wife and I had dinner at Bernard's last night.  It has been a while so we tried new items.  It is one of our favorite local spots when we want a special dinner.  We were not disappointed.

The warm crusty sliced baguette they serve up front was nice and fresh.  The butter tasted sweeter than most so I'm not sure what brand they use, but it was very good.

My wife had French Onion Soup then the \"Braised Chicken Mille Feuille, with mushrooms, garlic and artichokes topped with puff pastry and mustard fondue sauce.\"  The soup has a lot of onions and with a great full flavor.  The chicken was very tender and enjoyable.

I also had the soup then the \"Tandoori Chicken in Curry Masala Sauce, Served with Basmati Rice, Vegetables, Maharazi and Gazpacho Shooter.\"  I'm not a fan of cold soups, but for Gazpacho, it was as good as any I've had.  I was expecting more of a traditional Tandoori flavor, but this was still excellent.  They grill it on flat skewers, with the chicken alternating with onion slices and red pepper.  The rice had a nice flavor, complimenting the chicken very well.  I'd love the recipe.  The basamati flavor was there, as one would expect.

One impressive thing Bernard's does well is the plating.  The prices are very reasonable, and the beautiful plating is typical of what one would only expect to see in a more expensive restaurant.  Good job.

All in all, we love the food, the service and prices.  Oh, since it was \"Titanic\" Thursday, they has the movie Titanic playing on a large screen TV.  They also had an excellent jazz guitarist playing.  He alone I'd so see just for his music set."}
{"text":"We love Bernard's Bistro!! What a fantastic restaurant! We love how close it is to our house and the food is generally fantastic. We particularly love the open-faced shrimp sandwich (I forget what it's actually called). We usually do lunch and love the ambiance, the staff, and supporting a very local spot. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Second time here within a week... Hugo ... The food... The company was awesome. Love this place. Love coming here with Dean... Love everything about Bernard's... Def... Coming back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing neighborhood spot! My husband and I ate here for dinner last night. We shared the escargot, he had the ribeye, I had the salmon. True to all reviewers, the pesto mashed potatoes were really good. 

I wasn't sure about the wine list, so after calling to ask a few questions, we decided to bring a bottle (corkage is $20).

The service staff was amazingly friendly and helpful; it really seemed like a team environment amongst them!

The live music was a bonus!

We'll surely be back! Thanks, Lynn, for ensuring we had a great date last night!"}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. Husbands meatloaf was very good, barbecue sauce was overpowering. The veggies and mashed potatoes were excellent. 
The chicken and mushroom crepe was ok, not great. The side salad was beautiful. The service was very attentive. Nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Bernard's. Food, staff and atmosphere are top notch. One of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Finally!!!!! After many, many failed restaurants at this location over the past decade, I truly feel that Bernard's is the perfect place for this location  to be successful! Why do you ask, because the food was FANTASTIC! The attention to detail you get here,  from any appetizer, to entree, to desert is an experience you would expect from paying hundreds of dollars at a fine French restaurant on LV Strip. I swear, I was so happy with this quaint locals place that I know I will be back many, many times! 
FYI it's the same fabulous owner and restaurant as Bernard's at the beautiful Lake Las Vegas! Please go here.......they deserve to be open for a long time!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and delicious! Staff is very accommodating and friendly. We have been wanting to try this place for awhile and it didn't not disappoint! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very accomodating for my teenage son with Autism.  They made him pasta the only way he will eat it.  My vegetarian husband was very satisfied with his crepes - the side salad was unexciting.  My artichoke soup was delish, as was the \"Titanic\" chicken and shrimp dish.  The garnish was a little skimpy but good.  Our server, Danny, served me my cappuccino like a bit of a show - very fun!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for 14th wedding anniversary.  Not sure we will be returning.  This establishment is close to our house and the positive yelp reviews lured us in.  Expensive dinner for such poor service.  I started this review in the restaurant; we waited over 10 minutes for the server to pick up the check for us to pay....

While the food was very good, the establishment is a little kitschy to be classy.  If I have the most expensive thing on the menu, it better be amazing.  It wasn't.  Manager seemed to be hitting every table, but ours.  Perhaps, my mistake was the reservation through Open Table mentioning our anniversary.  That may scream, special occasion, likely not to return.  If we drop over $100 for dinner, it should make us want to sing when we leave.  This place just didn't do that for me."}
{"text":"After reading reviews about Bernard's it seemed like it would be a great place for dinner. The night we went in there was plenty of available seating but we were seated at a very awkward table that was more in the way if anything. The wait staff was friendly. The atmosphere was pleasant. The food was good, not really memorable. I'd probably stop by again for lunch."}
{"text":"Casual dining and excellent service.  Nice assorted menu.  A needed addition to the area."}
{"text":"The food reminds me of when i travel to parts of Europe. A beautiful presentation great flavors, the piano playing, the decor on the wall. Customer service is awesome, they make you feel special. The chicken dish is good and the tuna is delicious. Nice Wine selection.The food could make the cover of Bon appetit magazine."}
{"text":"Let's start with warm, friendly service when we walked in the door.  Very refreshing.   Nice decor, comfortable seating.   And you can tell it's fresh.  I had a salad that jumped off the plate with beauty and taste.  Don't miss the beet vinaigrette - sounds strange, tastes amazing.  The quiche Florentino melted in my mouth.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This....YES! My wife got the Filet Mignon Lily. Literally one of the most perfect steaks I have ever tasted. I had the Rack of Lamb with Roasted Duck. I took my time savoring every bite of this. It was absolutely amazing. The atmosphere was very relaxed, yet \"high end\". It was Titanic Night, so the specialty dishes were inspired by those served on the Titanic. All the while, the Titanic movie was playing in the background. A very romantic and memorable experience. Rhonda and the rest of the staff provided excellent service. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really Really excellent. Was recommended by friends. Best Eggs Benedict. The Hungarian Goulash is outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I love the atmosphere, soft live music , very friendly staff. I have been here twice now and each time I was very happy.  It's nice to dress up a bit and enjoy a really great dinner. I look forward to more visits to Bernard's."}
{"text":"Lost my reservation but luckily still found a table for us.   Got Rosy as our server (again).  She's fantastic"}
{"text":"Spent a Saturday night dinner here and was pleasantly surprised.  Had the Caesar salad and the Ahi Tuna dinner and my wife had the Cannelloni and both were fantastic.   Nice wine selection, nothing super pricey but decent choices.  Finished with espresso and overall was a great experience.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Bernard's Bistro IS NOT CLOSED - JUST A NEW NAME - SAME GREAT FOOD AND MENU.Bernard died and it is now called CB's Legacy.  We had a fabulous brunch there Sunday May 22, 2016."}
{"text":"Dinner with my OG calls for a new and exciting foodventure. Perusing my bookmarks, Bernard's Bistro beckoned us. 

We arrived around 7pm and we were greeted warmly. They had live music playing and it was lovely and soothing. 

We were seated quickly and our server arrived at our table promptly. Service was the best I've encountered in a while. He anticipated all our needs, refills on bread and drinks were perfectly timed and he made great entree suggestions. I really appreciated that he wasn't shy about letting us know his favorites on the menu when we asked.

I ordered the seafood crepes and my friend ordered the chicken schnitzel. Both entrees were delicious. I couldn't get enough and the portions were incredibly generous for the price point.

Based on the exceptional service, beautiful ambiance and delicious food, I look forward to coming back soon. It's a great little date night spot in Henderson."}
{"text":"Everyone who lives in this area or has driven by it knows that this location is practically cursed. Every restaurant that has gone there has failed, and having been to several of them, I am not surprised why. I think this is the first place that has a real shot at being successful.

My boyfriend and I decided to try it since we live right down the street. They were lacking in a few places having just opened. The decor was all over the place, and they could use a few drapes and new upholstery on the furniture, but they clearly prioritized getting things right in all the right places. Bottom line: Great service and great food. I feel all their issues were mainly aesthetic.

We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us at a booth, which made it feel like we were eating at real restaurant for the first time at that location (past establishments had failed at this minor detail from the get go).

A server came by and read us a few specials. She was very friendly and patient, as I wanted to try everything on the menu and couldn't decide what to order. I started out with their special for the day, the red sangria. Delish! Their menu listed open faced sandwiches, wraps, pastas, burgers, and entrées, all of which looked carefully crafted and unique to this restaurant. I eventually decided on the Casablanca Bogart Burger, which was deliciously complimented with goat cheese, a spicy sauce I can't quite remember the name of, and ratatouille. I would have taken a picture, but I dug into the burger so fast I'd forgotten to. It was beautifully presented and looked so good I couldn't wait. The boyfriend ordered just the club sandwich which was equally tasty. We finished off with the creme brûlée for dessert... And from then I swore I'd be back!

I don't really even Yelp that often, but this place is definitely worth it. It's only been a day but I have been telling all my friends and now I'm Yelping to try and keep this place alive. See ya at Bernard's! :)"}
