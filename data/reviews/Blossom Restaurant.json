{"text":"The Restaurant is actually called Blossom Inn, and used to be a very hip place to dine in the 50's & 60's the d√©cor sure hasn't changed since then, I liked this place on and off since moving to this area 7 years ago, we seem to give it another chance every 6 months since the management changed 2 years ago, the food we had was as follows Chicken balls were over cooked too much batter and a tiny piece of chicken, the beef and Broccoli was good the beef was tender and the broccoli was crunchy it was hot and the sauce was spiced just right.They used to do a dried crispy beef dish there called \"Blossom beef\" the owner was very proud of this, it was good, but the new people can't prepare it at all, it seemed a lazy attempt the Beef was cut too big no julienned carrots and the sauce was a gloopy sweet mess, the Cantonese chow mien and steamed rice were average. I'm not really a fan of this place to be honest"}
{"text":"I happened upon this restaurant one day and tried it and it seemed great so I decided to give it another shot...
I did the mistake of getting takeout and when I got home and started to look at the food I sensed something wasn't right..
I ordered the Ginger beef and it was pure Ginger... And the chicken balls were hard as stone not to mention the sweet and sour sauce tasted like ketchup..
We called them up to tell them about the beef and they could of cared less, they didn't seem to care at all actually.
If you go here stay away from the Ginger beef.
This place is just your average Chinese restaurant, nothing special but not horrible either."}

The pad tai is your best bet IMO"}
