{"text":"Terrific. As a whiskey fan and from strong Scottish stock, this is a gem in the Big Smoke. If you are only in Toronto for a visit or live here get your butt into The Caledonian."}
{"text":"I reckon this is the best Scottish bar in the GTA. Appropriately then, it's a bit fancy. It deserves to be.  Everything was nice: the Scottish waitress, the Brewdog beer, and the Haggis fritters. Prepare to drop some ducats though. This place delivers a well-crafted experience to those have the means or the occasion to enjoy it guilt-free."}
{"text":"Love it. Lots of good scotch (scotch menu must be ~ 10 pages long), food is delicious and service is great. Wouldn't mind a slightly more expanded food menu ... we're talking 5 more items.. that would be nice. Oh and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Caledonian is the only popular Scottish pub/restaurant that I know in Toronto and it's for a good reason.   Highlights:  - One of the best fish and chips dishes that I've had. Both the fish AND the chips were fantastic. The chips were almost as good at McD's!!  - Haggis, haggis, haggis! I've got to admit that I was hesitant at first to try this dish. But I'm a huge fan of anything lamb and let me tell you this, if you like lamb, you're going to like this dish. My only complaint is that it seemed a little bit dry but since this was my first time trying this dish, I have no point of reference. Also, I would serve this dish on mashed sweet potatoes instead of turnip, simply because I HATE turnip.  - Quick service. We got our food within 10 min of ordering! (mind you after that the service got super slow)  - Great, dimly lit, romantic ambiance. Perfect for a date.   - Excellent selection of Scottish beer and scotch.   - Reasonable prices.   - Outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"If this was solely based on going out and having a drink, I would totally give it a 5. But we've got other things to consider!   Atmosphere: loved it! So adorable and cozy and warm. The owner was on the floor seating us. She was so kind and friendly and so Scottish! Very authentic.  Service: unfortunately we got the new girl. As much as she was sweet, she screwed up really bad...over and over and over again. It was rough. They comped 1 appetizer which I didn't think was enough considering the scope of the bad service. Hopefully she gets better! It was a busy night.  Food: the food was ok. Nothing super impressive. The fried pickles were good. The butter chicken was ok. Steak pie was pretty good. The Mac n cheese wasn't quite as awesome as it sounded. So the food wasn't mind blowing.  Drinks: my hubby got the rob Roy. That is a stiiiiiiff drink but he liked it. Not a huge beer selection but enough. They are in fact known for their whiskey selection.   Overall, I would go back for a drink, snacks and the lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and selection of drinks. Ordered the haggis and we sat in the back patio, which was fairly nice except for the fact that it's walled off and you don't get a view."}
{"text":"Fine dining food quality in a intimate pub setting.  Best Scotch egg ever had.  Haggis on par with what I had in Scotland.  Love the Scotch selection.  Must try for anyone looking for that authentic Scottish experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, the best service I've had in ages, and a fantastic fish and chips - where the large filets are lightly battered and delicious - where the fries laying under the filet aren't starchy, over-oiled, and soggy.  Crisp and light, flavourful.  The Scotch Egg is delightful, crispy and rich - finish it with the creamy bread pudding and wash it all down with a Caledonian pint.  The haggis was more than I'd expected in terms of texture and presentation.   Dreamy."}
{"text":"This is a scotch drinkers dream! In addition their Scotch Tours, which include flights of around 6-9 regional scotches, you can also sign up for free scotch tastings. The atmosphere is warm and intimate. The food is traditional and delicious- Haggis fritters, beer battered fish n chips, deep fried dill pickles, steak pie, sticky toffee puddin- Not for the faint of stomach... Will return often."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The owner is a very nice Scottish lady, the food is delightful, and the last time I was there someone actually broke out some bagpipes to play."}
{"text":"I think it's an amazing little pub for the area and central Toronto as a whole! I ordered the Steak Pie and it was delicious. Rather than getting an overly greasy, massive portion of junk, the dish was impressive. Perfectly cooked green beans was a pleasant surprise for a pub!  The owner Donna, was really friendly and genuine, constantly checking in on us. Great beer and whisky selection, cozy understated (not tacky) decor... great little spot on College west! Had a great time, definitely going back.  ps: there's an area in the back for a patio.. can't wait for warm weather to enjoy this outdoor pub space!"}
{"text":"I came here the other day with my husband and our son. I had the vegetarian haggis and it was outstanding!! my husband and son each got a burger, also delicious. The service was great and the atmosphere was very cozy. We had such a lovely time and will be back."}
{"text":"Best pub in all of Toronto!  I wanted some fish and chips one night, so my boyfriend and I checked Blogto for the best in our area. Caledonian was rated number one, so we walked over. After we ordered, we told our waitress about why we came in (as the fish and chips were voted 'best in Little Italy'). The waitress brought the owner over, who was so sweet! She thanked us for coming, then we watched her go behind the bar to pull out her phone as her and the waitresses checked Blogto. You could tell she was excited about how well received her food was, and I love to see that in a resturant.  The fish and chips are amazing. Super crunchy batter, and thin fries. We've returned for other great food as well: the burger is super tasty and the mac and cheese is rich and creamy.. All of the portions are very generous as well! Try the curry with the fries if you want a bit of heat! I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.    I will keep returning to this place again and again. Great service and food, amazing atmosphere (the back patio is beautiful), and just a wonderful vibe from the owner!"}
{"text":"*For Drink but no food* I came here with friend for my birthday. This place is very cosy and I enjoyed the warm and live vibe. Great selection of whiskey and interesting concepts of pre-set tasting menu. They are reasonably priced and the menu offers different price points as well. However. I went there for dinner, which is a mistake. I ordered a pie (forgot which kind) and we ordered some appetizers and we are not impressed. If you are looking for a loud bar with great food, Bar hop (the one at spadina and king) is my go to place. To be fair, this is a great bar and I'd come back for another night of scotch tasting or just some drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Friendliest staff and nicest manger/owner (the woman with the red hair! so lovely!), always delicious food and a warm atmosphere.  I've probably been here at least 6-7 times now and it's consistently excellent. If you are interested in whiskey this is the place to go. There are many other options for non-whiskey drinkers so don't worry about feeling left out if it's not your thing. Fancy a Guinness?  The food is awesome. It's a small menu but by now I've tried almost everything on it. The starters such as the scotch egg, haggis fritters and sausage roll \"Taste of Scotland\" platter are a must! All the mains are great and while at first the idea of haggis freaked me out, it is really tasty and definitely worth trying here!  I've been to a couple complimentary whiskey tastings here (be sure to follow them on Facebook to find out about events like this!) and they were really fun and educational if you want to explore whiskey. The Caledonian is really interested in engaging the community - whiskey lovers and those who will soon enough turn into whiskey lovers - and I'm all for that."}
{"text":"Placed an order for fish and chips and a couple scotch eggs. Picked the order up brought it back home (2 min away) opened up the boxes and tried a couple french fries. They were not nearly up to par. Then I opened up the tinfoil around the fish to find the batter was like a paste coating over the fish it was inedible so I figured I'd try the scotch eggs open that up try dipping in of the sauces and the sauce was a salt overload I like salt I like a lot of salt but this was also an inedible and to top it off the scotch eggs were not very good either. $50 wasted and left two people hungry for the night."}
{"text":"It is a very warm and welcoming place. Donna, the owner made a point to come over and introduce herself, and dropped by from time to time to ensure all was well. I noticed that everyone who came through the door had the same treatment. The servers too, were all very warm and personable. I felt very settled the whole night  The food was excellent. I started with a Scotch egg. I love Scotch eggs, and have few places to have them and this was as good as my Scottish neighbor used to make in Oshawa a lifetime ago. Teena and I both had fish and chips which were great. I loved the lightly battered fish, the chips and the greens which came with it.  I love the beer selection. They have a good draught selection but if you are looking for true Scottish beer, it comes in bottle form. Many great and unusual choices.  Their motto on the website is \"Come for the food, stay for the drink, return for the friends you've made.\"  As Teena and I left, Donna the owner, on a very busy night, made sure to call out to tell us to have a good night and thanks for coming.  Thanks Donna......and yes we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great  - from the food, to the service, to the atmosphere. The owner is warm and friendly and greets you when you arrive. There is such a friendly vibe when you walk in, it;s really refreshing. It's a very mixed crowd - young, old - it has a great neighborhood feel. And the haggis fritters and fish and chips are the best!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday tasting of scotch bit was surprised by the quality of the food. Every single item be ordered was fabulous. We had The scotch egg and the curry fries to start. The curry had an incredible depth of flavor and the fries were perfectly cooked. The scotch egg had a great texture and the outer layer of sausage was no Jimmy deans . For the mains we had the Mac n cheese the butter chicken and the scotch pie. Finished with deep fried mars bar. Check this place out."}
{"text":"This is probably the best local I've ever had.  Service is always friendly, prompt and reliable. The staff here are great at remembering your name and your favourite drink, even when it changes regularily like mine.   Not only is the atmosphere friendly, but the food here is excellent. And while some might say that the prices are higher than your local downtown dive bar, it's excellent value, and a top location if you're looking to hang out with friends or catch up with that special person in your life"}
{"text":"I've been once and thought it was a decent place. I went with a friend on a quiet Sunday evening, it was definitely cosy. Both servers were nice and friendly. Sadly I can't say much on the whiskey selection - I had wine (of the week?), a reasonably priced VQA, my friend stuck with beer.   I thought some of the food was a bit overpriced for the pub environment - I love Scotch eggs but couldn't bring myself to spend 8 bucks for one here (vs. 2-3 pounds in the UK). I went for the Mac and Cheese, which was very good with healthy lashings of bacon.   I didn't feel compelled to rush back though but would probably try again."}
{"text":"We made an evening reservation for a bachelor party, and these guys had the fucking nerve to cancel it on us the afternoon of, without notification."}
{"text":"It you want proper Scottish food from a proper scottish lass i highly recommend 'The Calendonia'  We ordered the Steak Special and the Hagis. The Steak was tender,  cooked perfectly, with a delicious peppercorn sauce. The grilled veggies were a nice touch.  Now, i had the Hagis....and it was absolutely amazing. Now those who may be nervous about idea of hagis i suggest that you give it a shot, you will not regret it. It was so flavourful and moist, it was better then my memory of Scotland a few years ago.   Great place, great food, and remember...try the hagis ;)"}
{"text":"Have been here repeatedly, if only to study the whiskey menu as a means of expanding my very limited vocabulary of tasting notes ... my personal plat du jour is the (non)-sharing 'taste of Scotland', which includes one Scotch egg, two mini sausage rolls, and two haggis fritters ... washed down with a few original Innis and Gunns."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to the neighborhood because it's a little more upscale than most of the bars- but still comfortable enough not to care what you're wearing. Been a few times and the food hasn't forced me to write home to mom, but the Innis and Gunn / Guinness / beers on tap taste a little better given the environment.   The space sort of reminds me of what The Keg might have looked like before it was a chain. Does that make any sense? Doesn't seem to have any drink specials I'm aware of, so you'll probably be spending $6.50 a pint or so.  Manager is a cute little number that puts some effort to make sure you're having a good time, which is nice.  Also, biggest basement hallway / smallest bathroom combo I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Fraîchement revenu d'Écosse, voilà que je découvre à quelques pas de chez moi un excellent petit pub écossais tenu par des écossais avec non seulement d'excellents whiskys écossais mais aussi de la restauration traditionnelle. Du Haggis? Mais bien sûr ! Préparé par un boucher de Glasgow émigré dans la région, c'est comme si vous étiez de retour dans la vieille Calédonie !"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Had the fish & chips.    Regarding Scotch Eggs:  They're not Scottish at all.  They're English."}
{"text":"Such a great place.  The owner is really friendly, the back patio is beautiful and the food and drink are fantastic.  I don't live anywhere close to it, but I have been twice already and hope to go back again very soon.  I will always make the trek for this gem."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner - I had the steak pie and fries and my boyfriend got the haggis entree (beautiful presentation!)  Food was very flavourful and filling, the service was friendly and attentive, last but not least there's the extensive scotch & whiskey offerings! Definitely worth taking the time to peruse and enjoy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot. I wish it was closer to home, then I would go more often. It provides a nice atmosphere and has daily menu specials. I ordered the burger with stilton cheese. My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips. The fish was massive, took up the entire plate. It was good, but the batter got a bit soggy near the end of the meal. There are better fish and chip places in the city, but this was pretty solid for pub fare. The burger was nice and juicy on a soft bun with fresh ingredients. I really like that they offered several different cheeses to put on your burger. We arrived early, just after 6:00pm on a Friday night. It was pretty quiet initially, but by the time we left, it was at capacity. This seems to be a popular spot in the city."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, great food, wonderful single malt scotch selection. Try the fries in curry sauce!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening with two other friends. The place was packed and wait time was a few minutes. Our seating hostess had an endearing Scottish accent and seated us at a tiny table meant for two. Our third guest had to sit on a stool off to the side, fearing for his life that passersby and wait staff would spill something on him, but we managed for a quarter hour until we moved on to the next available table. Although it was tight, it made for closer conversations without having to yell too much. Had the grilled salmon with black beans and avocado sauce (that night's special, not on the regular menu), and a glass of Tennents Lager. The salmon was grilled beautifully and I must have inhaled every morsel of that avocado sauce. Guests around us were adorable and some spoke with Scottish accents that made you want to speak with Scottish accents too. The washrooms were clean and stocked well with toilet paper, but there was only one sink and mirror for the ladies, with inadequate lighting. All in all, the actual dining experience and service was fantastic. I would like to return again to try their whisky and haggis when I feel more adventurous."}
{"text":"I love whisky so it's nice to hit up a place with a vast whisky menu. The curry I ordered was fantastic and the server was attentive and quick even though the place was rammed."}
{"text":"Awesome place, friendly service and food that actually reminded me of my stay in Ireland (I mean Ireland and Scotland DO have a lot of similar food).  Comfortable pub kind of atmosphere and all-round good experience : ) The smoked salmon there was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and will keep coming back! The decor is dark and there is plenty of seating. There's rooms towards the back that are a little more intimate for a small group. Butter chicken and the steak pies with Tennent's were delicious. (Boyfriend had haggis and loved it too) The outside is very nicely decorated and quaint. The service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow, found this place on Yelp, and we were in the neighbourhood looking for a yummy place to grab a pint and a bite to eat. When we walked in the door we thought it was going to be impossible to get a seat, because the place was jam-packed! One of the waitresses quickly made her way over to us to greet us, and let us know that a table was about to free up, so we only had to wait about 4-5 minutes to get a table. It was worth the wait.   It's a traditional Scottish-style pub, and a really cool place. The tables are packed in a slightly too close to one another, making it a bit tricky to get in and out of your seat, but I guess that means a few extra tables and makes it so that more people can get in to enjoy the place.  They maintain a bar which stocks mostly imported beers and alcohols, which a feature scotch, which one of my friends opted for. Magners and Keith's ciders were the only ones available, but the waitress assured me that Magner's is great with lots of ice, which it was.   The menu is someone limited in it's selections, but it seems that they stick to what they know, and what they do well. The food was delicious. I opted for some sort of a beef pie with a light and flaky toping and mashed red-skinned potatoes. The pie was light, not thickened and packed full of gravy, with a hearty mix of tasty veggies and deliciously tender beef. Yum!   One of my friends ordered a salad off of the appetizer menu, which she enjoyed, and the other opted for the mac and cheese, which she liked. I tasted the mac and cheese and thought it could've used a bit more S&P, but otherwise it was tasty. Food prices were very reasonable.... it worked out to be about $20-25 per person for an entrée and an alcoholic beverage. Not bad.  Overall, it the place had an upscale, cozy feel for a traditional pub. Very enjoyable. The music wasn't too loud, which was nice... we could actually talk to each other."}
{"text":"Best smoky Caesar I've had yet. Really nice atmosphere and fireplace for chilly winter days, and the fish and chips are great too. It's also quite family friendly and they were really sweet about us bringing our baby."}
{"text":"The warm and inviting atmosphere at this brand new Scottish pub is a whisky lover dream. Plus, it's the only place in the city where I've ever seen haggis on the menu... I'm still working up to trying the haggis but I'll report back once I do.   This bar might just breathe some new life into this strip of College Street that was previously home to not much more than several vacant shop fronts and the less than stellar Black Knight."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends on a Saturday night. It did take us a loooong time to get seated but we were able to drink at the bar until we did. Great selection of scotch and surprisingly a lot of Scottish beers too. Drinks were definitely great and never ignored when we needed refills or help on decisions. Once we did get seated one thing I was not expecting to find on the menu was a vegetarian haggis. And yet there it was! So technically probably not really haggis since it obviously lacked in some key ingredients (maybe made haggis better???) but who cares. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots in the city to grab a drink and quality pub grub in a cozy, welcoming atmosphere.  Donna and her staff are extremely knowledgeable about scotch and treat everyone as equals, from experts to novices.  And I know because I had my first Islay here.  Go ahead and ask your questions, they'll bend over backwards to find what your looking for and educate you in the process.  I've always had great experiences learning about new scotches here. Assuming you can get a seat, the back patio in the summertime is also a not so hidden gem.  I also enjoy the niche beer list focused on scottish imports like Innis and Gun and Tennents.  Rounding out this bar is the simple but quality food menu.  I think I've tried almost everything from the butter chicken to the haggis and I've never been disappointed.  The only item that I found closer to average was the burger but the fish & chips was the best I've had in the city.  Overall, you can expect good food that's not going to break your wallet.  I can't comment on authenticity because I haven't been to Scotland but friends of Scottish decent seem to enjoy the roast beef and bread pudding, Scottish egg, and the haggis even though I understand it's not served in its most traditional form.   My only knock is that the prices of certain scotches that can get quite high so I've had some bills creep up there after some tastings.  But that's really a product of the LCBO system more than anything else so I'm not going to hold it against the Caley..  Overall, fantastic place!  Please don't change a thing."}
{"text":"Probably the best pub in Toronto in terms of great comfort food, incredible whiskey selection and an ambience without equal."}
{"text":"The Caledonian is an upscale Scottish restaurant (with upscale prices) with traditional pub style food. It is famous for its wide selection of Scotch whiskey. It is quite dark, mostly candlelit. We loved our meals - we had the taste of Scotland appetizer (shared), fish and chips (the best I've ever had, light and flaky), steak pie and sticky toffee pudding. The food was well prepared and presented.The service was good and owner is very friendly. If you go on a Saturday night, make a reservation, the place is packed and you may be given the small round tables near the door."}
{"text":"The food was alright,  I'd say even pretty good.   Tried the steak pie with a side of haggis.  The haggis was actually pretty good.  Good beer selection,  though I'm surprised they didn't grace guiness....How can a pub like this not have guiness?    The server was so bloody rude that it ruins the whole experience though.   Who doesn't say sorry when they spill and splash something over their guests.   And who demands for, instead of apologizing and asking if it's ok to pay with credit because they ran out of change...  And she didn't even tell us it was last call. So when we tried to order dessert all she says is the kitchen's already closed.  Don't ruin your nice bar with such bad service......"}
{"text":"Amazing food, more Scotch than you can ever drink (is that a challenge?!) and a really friendly atmosphere. This place is a great night out. It can get extremely busy on Friday and Saturday nights so you may want to book a table ahead of time (like earlier in the week!) if possible. I had a flight (or two, or three) of different whiskies and they were all excellently paired. I would have appreciated some text to help explain what I may experience with each one, but that's me being overly picky."}
{"text":"The best , and really only Scottish pub in the city. The owner is super friendly, the food is good and there are millions of scotches. I've had to stop going regularly because of the hole I inevitably put in my wallet when I go."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying I am not a whiskey person. At all. Ever. But the whiskey based cocktails they have cooking at The Calendonian were good enough to turn me.   A friend of mine was raving about this place so I decided to check it out with him. It's a nice Scottish pub in the College and Ossington area and is well loved by many of it's regulars. The one thing that stood out to me was the community they've created here. It seemed like the owner and staff knew almost every person who walked through the door by name. I love that! I even made a few new friends myself.   For the whiskey lovers, they've got pages and pages of whiskeys to choose from. Can't decide? Get a whiskey flight!   For the alcohol lovers who can't stand whiskey straight up, aka me, there's a really great selection of cocktails to pick from. Try the martini!   Food-wise they have a one-page menu. Short and sweet, with your Scottish mainstays like Haggis, Steak pie, Fish and chips, basically food that makes my heart sigh with contentment. I ordered the Steak pie with mash on the side and was not let down. The puff pastry was golden as advertised and the chunks of steak melted in my mouth.   The place filled up considerably as the night went on but I am thankful to say the service never suffered. However, I would suggest making a reservation if you're thinking of dining here Friday night - I assume the same can be said of Saturday dinners.   I'm excited to return and try the Haggis next, and work my way through their cocktail list!   I would recommend this place for groups, they have the space for it."}
{"text":"Great Food, Wonderful Service, Incredible atmosphere on the lovely patio, and the best of all-- Outstanding value that would please any Scot! (and I'm half Scottish, so I can say this!)  We began with a bottle of Pinot Grigio that was an applaudable $30. It reeked of nothing but white peach, but for a summer's eve on a patio, this is not just allowed but welcomed!  We had the Scottish platter that consisted of Haggis fritters, sausage rolls and a scotch egg cut in half to share. YUM! Is there anything more delicious with a drink than a Scotch Egg?   I think not.  And to continue our 'No Vegetables Allowed' menu, we had fish and chips and the mac n Cheese. Fish was a crispy and generous portion of haddock with lots of chips, but they were very brown and over cooked. I forgive because everything else was so great.  Mac N Cheese---some of the best I've had and not made at home myself. They snuck a couple of cherry tomatoes in there, and they were a surprisingly delicious contrast to the cheesy decadence of the dish, itself.  Patio was nicely decorated without being pretentious, and the crowd was a mix of 30 somethings and a few old-timers. It's not a rowdy pub for the young 'uns.   Our server was the cutest and sweetest Glaswegian lass and we very much appreciated her witty anecdotes as much as her attentive and timely service. Our bill was just under $85 for all the aforementioned goodies.  This place is a winner or all fronts and I plan on coming back!!"}
{"text":"Why should you go to The Caledonian? I'll give you 4 Reasons: -Tennent's on tap  -Haggis, Neeps & Tatties   -Scottish Steak Pie  -Sticky Toffee Pudding All are excellent!! The pub also feels very authentic , with great service and had a nice  back patio."}
{"text":"I consider myself to be very lucky that this is my local - how can you go wrong with that many delicious beers (the Elderberry & Heather ones are my favourite, so far) and such an amazing (and reasonably priced) assortment of single malt scotch?  The food is significantly better than your average pub food - in particular the scotch egg, which cannot be adequately described due to it being That Good, and the steak pie, which is perfect winter food.   I like that it's unpretentious and casual, too, possibly because it's aimed at a slightly older crowd than other bars in the area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening.  Their patio is big and is split into 2 parts, covered and uncovered.  Decent beer selection, huge Scotch whiskey selection.  They even do scotch flights!  We had their taster platter and the scotch egg was amazing! Also ordered their mac & cheese and butter chicken.  If you like Mac & cheese, you'll love this one. Wow! The butter chicken was good too!  Our server was quick and attentive?.  To end, great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Some thoughts: Great setting to go and unwind with some friends. Candlelit, upscale pub feel. My friends and I witnessed a Scottish celebration of sorts beside us- it was amusing and a great atmosphere for all. Excellent selection of whiskey. Extremely helpful and friendly waitstaff. Apple fritters were delicious. I was boring and had a glass of cab sauv."}
{"text":"When you think of an Scottish pub, I think most people would think of a somewhat divey, low key spot with a wooden interior with a great chance or reeking of beer, with fried food galore and a clientele that's there with one purpose - to get drunk.  While there's still plenty of fried food on the menu (hey, that's the Scottish way afterall!) Caledonian was a nice break from that stereotype, it's an \"upscale\" Scottish pub which focuses on a good selection of whiskey, and traditional Scottish food. A dark interior and a clean and upscale ambiance, it's a place you'd find people in suits meeting after work.  Scottish eggs ($7 for one egg) were nice, though the fried out shell was a bit soft for my liking. If there are two of you, you should opt for the sampling platter ($16) which comes with a Scottish egg, 2 sausage rolls and 2 haggis fritters.   The curry fries ($8) were alright. Fries were a bit soggier than my liking, even the ones that weren't drenched in curry sauce.   The haggis ($16) was done right - a good big slice of haggis sitting on top of a bed of mash, and slathered in gravy. It has a pretty distinctive taste, with the lamb and tons of peppercorn. If you haven't had haggis, I'd give it a try - don't hate me if you don't like peppercorn though, you've been warned! And also be warned, it's really, really, really heavy!    Fish and chips ($15) looked ok, a heaping portion of fries with one piece of fish.   The steak pie ($14) was pretty good, but nothing special. The mash it came with was great though.   They also have a good selection of whiskey, with flights for tasting (0.5 oz pours in each flight) that range from $12 or so up to $50. A single drink will set you back about $8. Also a decent selection of beer, and yes, Guinness is definitely on tap :)"}
{"text":"This rating is mostly for the food. Came here for dinner with friends on a weekday evening. I was surprised at how classy this scottish pub was on the inside. Very romantic setting. However, I thought the lighting was too dim (I could barely read the menu).   I ordered the Taste of Scotland (sausage rolls, deep fried haggis, and scotch egg, with gracy and aioli dips). I didn't enjoy this dish very much. The sausage in the scottish egg had a funky taste, as did the aioli dip. The sausage rolls weren't anything special. I actually prefer the frozen sausage rolls that you can buy at the supermarket and bake yourself.   I asked my friends how they enjoyed their dishes as well. One friend really enjoyed the butter chicken while the other thought it was just ok. The meat pie may have been a bit bland cause my friend had to add ketchup. As for fish and chips, my friend said the batter was too thick compared to the amount of fish. Lastly, my friend's beer tasted watered down.   Definitely won't be back for the food. Maybe this place is better for drinks?"}
{"text":"Donna made this entire experience.  I was in town for a conference with some colleagues and she made us feel welcome regardless of whether we we were drinking great whisky or beer. Stop by this place if you're in Toronto and want something a little less than a tourist trap."}
{"text":"It's good... It's ok. On a crazy night service is lacklustre and you feel like an underprivileged guardian who has not received a social assistance in weeks- in regards to being acknowledged by your server. Pickle shots are fun and I would encourage trying them if one has not before. I have heard only excellent things about The Caledonians whiskey tastings, but on a regular night: drinks, service and food are mediocre in comparison to the other options of the area."}
{"text":"Great for a special event!  We organised a stag night which included a pit-stop at the Caley and they rolled out the red carpet for us.  The objective of our visit was to enjoy a whisky flight. The Caley, recognising the groom's preference for Speyside whisky, prepared a special selection which they \"named\" after the groom. They provided tasting notes and gave a talk about each whisky we sampled. This was very well received by all, especially our guest of honour.  We would have left afterwards, but they were smoking pulled pork and it was irresistible. We eventually departed... at closing time ;)"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere here, especially the back patio. Been here twice and this place is good for drinks and fish and chips.   Ive sampled a few things here like the Fries and curry, sample platter, haggis, fried pickles etc. And I find the food here too salty. Having said that, if you like to snack on salty foods with good beers then you're in luck.   Service here is good, but honestly would only come here for drinks if someone wants to come here."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying I may be biased as I am Scottish, but whenever I feel homesick I head here!  I know of no other bar which has such a fine variety of Scotch, serves Vodka and Irn Bru and has a haggis burger on the menu. (For those of you who have never heard of/tried Irn Bru - it is a bright orange Scottish soda/pop that has the most indescribable flavor, you either love it or hate it...I love it!)    My advice before going here is to book as I have never seen the place empty. Owned by a Scottish expat called Donna (who is a true salt of the earth West Coast Scottish person!)  it has a super friendly relaxed atmosphere. On my first visit I was greeted with a hug and welcomed in to the bar.   Do try the following - haggis fritters (if you only want to brave a mouthful of this beautiful food), the fish and chips (fries), the haggis, neeps and tatties (turnip and mashed potato) and if your waistline permits the deep fried mars bar. Most items on the menu have a recommended whiskey pairing...and do try, especially with the haggis.  The food has always been lovely, I have been here on several occasions. In fact a group of friends and I went here on Christmas Eve, I honestly felt like I was home. I cannot say enough how inviting and fantastic this place is!   Warning - most Scottish cuisine should be eaten with a group of friends, preferably trained in CPR as undoubtedly someone will need resuscitated!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. Very hearty! The owner is fabulous also. Made our party of 3 feel very welcome. I enjoyed the fact that most of the staff where Scottish and there was plenty of banter to be had. Will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Love it. Tasty selection of Scottish and other craft beers and an array of whiskeys and scotch. The lighting is very dim (a tad too dim?) but this is certainly preferable to overly bright. They accommodated our reservation for 6 at the very last minute and managed to save us a table on a busy Thursday night. Also a comfortable place to grab a drink at the bar solo.   I always though that haggis was \"gross\" but its actually quite delightful. Sort of like a meatloaf / shepherd's pie but with lamb, and better! The fish & chips are what you would expect: deep fried and filling.Our Scottish server was very Scottish - accent and all. She was patient with the late arrival of part of our group and invited us back for a whiskey event the following week. She was friendly and quite funny.  I will definitely return. Caledonian is ALMOST a 5-star but loses a point for a somewhat aggressive up-selling of additional drinks. Apart from that minor mishap, I am absolutely delighted and pleasantly surprised with The Caledonian."}
{"text":"The patio was quite. Service was good and the food was also delicious. Nice selection of scotch, but be prepared to spend some money. It ain't cheap, but then again, scotching isn't a cheap hobby."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is right.  Busy, at times loud.  Excellent single malt inventory and the staff knows what they are.  I asked if they had a Balvenie Caribbean Cask, the Lass replied, instantly, \"Of course the 14 year old!\"   Food was top notch. The Mrs loved the Steak and Ale Pie, I had the Haggis stack with neeps and tatties. (fresh caught that day).  Best haggis I have tasted this side of the pond... not quite up to Stornoway or MacSweens.  I would like a little more spice and a little more of that dark  organy flavor.  But as it is, it will more likely suit North American tastes.  We shared the Ardbeg house smoked salmon.... awesome and very unique with texture halfway between cold smoked and hot roasted.  The peaty-ness of the Ardbeg came through very subtle and pleasantly.  Try it it is a don't miss."}
{"text":"The service is fantastic! My friend and I both had the mac n cheese which was delicious. Casual atmosphere with a nice back patio. We were even offered a complimentary whiskey tasting after our meal. Will return!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Donna is, in my opinion, the most engaging and people-first restaurant owner in Toronto. This is her baby and it shows in how she remembers names, drinks, faces; in the delightful (if all female which is cheating to a lecherous Italian-Irishman) staff; in the vibe of 'don't you wish this was your living room?' The scotch selection is second to none, and beers are likewise excellent.  All I can say is I'm dead glad this is my local."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich for $16. Im not sure what I expected - the meat was tender with a nice amount of sauce, but the bread was an average white roll not toasted nothing else inside. Polenta fries were good until halfway through when I felt like a grease ball. The server was nice enough, asked for her advice what was the biggest portion. She originally suggested the pie. Maybe thats a better choice."}
{"text":"Once again, I love the whiskey selection here. They have a huge variety (anything from Macallans, Laphroigs, and even a Japanese whiskey).  This time, I also had the food. The selection is brief and very Scottish. The fish and chips were crispy and great. The apple/pear crumble was delicious.   The clientele is a mixed bag - students and geriatrics, young professionals and baggy hipsters. The waitstaff are friendly and as accommodating as possible.  Laid back atmosphere.  I have nothing bad to say about this place. Nothing at all."}
{"text":"Glad this place is right near home for me.  Always a great spot for stopping in for a pint or a whisky and the best fish + chips.  Friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"First timer! went there last night with my honey, before a play. I can't say enough about the service : they seated us right away, and the server was friendly and attentive with us all evening, despite it being SUPER busy. Somehow they managed to seat everyone that kept pouring in, even though the place already seemed packed.   The scotch selection was awesome and reasonably priced, which pleased my guy greatly. I really enjoyed the award-winning Caesar. They have an interesting mixed drinks list as well.   The food menu is short and simple, but what we ordered was awesome. As other reviewers mentioned: they make an amazing scotch egg! I mean, I guess it's hard to make a bad one, but I really enjoyed it. The HAGGIS. I can't say enough good things about this, it was really filling and I was quite sad I couldn't finish it because each bite tasted like the most comfiest of comfort foods. It's my new favorite dish!  My partner ordered the fish and chips: the fish was pretty oily but very tasty and still crunchy, a huge portion that we could have split probably. The fries are perfect juliennes and the tartar sauce was tasty.   Overall, we came for the drinks but will come back for the food, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Excellent whiskey selection (Glenfarclas!), at very reasonable prices.Wait staff have delightful scottish accents."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to stop in for some dinner last weekend, and am glad I did!  The draught beer selection is pretty sizeable and I tried a pint of Deuchars IPA with impressive results. For an apps we chose the Sausage Rolls ($7) which came with 2 medium sized sausage rolls and a small amount of mixed greens salad which together were nice start to things. My girlfriend had some kind of whiskey made mussels which were they days special. She said they were good but left an uneasy feeling in her stomach, maybe because shes not normally a whiskey drinker. For mains, I went with the Highland Burger ($15) with shoestring fries (that may have been thinner than my actual shoelaces) with an order of their curry sauce that they recommend with the fries. Personally I thought the curry tasted better on the burger than fries, but in the end it was a pretty satisfying meal either way. My girl had the Steak Pie ($14) which was is exactly what it sounds like, and received no complaints. We also split a dessert of some sort of chocolate cake thing which was quite good.  Overall I liked the place. It reminded me of the Aulde Spot Pub as it was a little more on the gastropub/higher end vibe than the traditional dank pubs. While I was charged for 3 drinks each when we only had 2, that was quickly corrected and in the end we paid $92 after tax before tip for 2 apps, 2 mains, 4 pints, and 1 dessert... So it was on scale for what I expected and the food didn't disappoint so I had no problem paying it, and can see myself coming back in the warmer weather to take advantage of what looks to be a pretty sweet backyard patio."}
{"text":"The Caledonian only got better on my repeat visit. A confluence of elements created the perfect meal - cozy dimly-lit dark wood interior, gorgeous bar, quiet chatter, amazing owner, delicious food, wonderful beer selection. It's the perfect place for a casual date night (if you enjoy your date). The service was also top-notch, and not for nothing, but the servers and the owner were all running themselves silly to provide their guests with the best experience in the most unpretentious manner.  The owner is a no-nonsense but delightful and warm woman who darts around the place like a pistol, clearing plates and spouting out wonderful things in a Scottish accent, such as \"Of course we've got room for you! Jump on in there!\" This, my friends, is what you want from a front-of-the-house manager. Straightforward and charming, she made the experience go from good to great. My husband swore that she'd go zipping across the room on a horse just like the main character in Brave at any moment, gorgeous wild red hair flying behind her!  The selection of Innis and Gunn here is fabulous - they have the original, the oak aged and a seasonal. In my opinion, go with the oak aged. It goes perfectly with just about anything! We got the Taste of Scotland appetizer...something right up my alley. Fried haggis, sausage rolls and a Scotch egg. Beautifully plated and a wonderful mix of textures - squishy, crunchy, salty, moist. Just the right amount to warm two people up with a couple pints of beer. As we usually do, we split an entree as well, this time being the steak pie with a side order of neeps. Mmm, mashed turnips - a favorite of mine from childhood that I haven't had in ages! The steak in the pie was fork-tender and the crust was homemade too. It was a nice little portion and, after our starter and beers, just the right amount of food. Of course this left room for dessert. We got the fried Mars bar. Every time I have this dish, I'm amazed by how good something so simple can taste -- that melted chocolate and carmel, covered with the crispy batter and a little dollop of ice cream is the perfect way to finish off the night!  The crowd at the Caledonian is mostly people in their late-20s to mid-50s. It's couples and groups catching up, it's not a place to go on a girls' night or a guys' night to pull someone of the opposite sex. Once you've found them at another bar, though, this is the perfect place to get to know your date better without killing your bank account. This isn't to say that the place wouldn't be perfect for groups to do organized whiskey tastings. Looks perfect for that!  A favorite that we will certainly return to as much as we can in Toronto, the Caledonian conjures warm and happy memories just as I write this review. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here the week after Rabbie Burns so it was still busier than expected and wise to get there early in the evening. Have been a couple of times before and have always been happy with my meal and service.   This time around we started with the scotch eggs which were spot on. I had the steak pie for my main.  It's not often the scent of food has such a profound effect on the experience but in this case I was instantly brought back to my Gran's kitchen.  The pie itself was delicious (but wee) as were the mashed potatoes on the side.   My wife had the haggis burger but wasn't as impressed. The haggis is sort of lost on the meat patty and patty itself was a bit on the dry side.  Their shoestring fries are great but would prefer thick cut chips in keeping it authentic.   The service is always friendly with the owner making rounds and making sure everything is running smoothly. Beer selection is good as well with many Scottish beers on tap not widely available elsewhere.   Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"After a game of ball hockey, my team and I decided to grab dinner to celebrate another successful season and with our experience with Indie Ale House in our last season outing, most of us had high hopes coming to The Caledonian for a Scottish dinner after an intense game.  Unfortunately, this place around the area was quite disappointing given it had positive reviews on yelp.  First of all, if you had been reading my reviews, you will know lighting is very important for me.  I dislike dim places because it makes me very sleepy and energy draining when I'm supposed to enjoy a meal especially at night! (maybe it would be considered as romantic if i was actually on a date).  Lighting is terrible here, it's so dim I can actually fall asleep.  Second, the ventilation was terrible, no AC at all on a day that is 25 degrees outside, our party had to move closer to the patio to actually feel a little breeze.  Third, the service was not great, server was not very attentive, wasn't polite either and didn't smile much,  But consider they only had two waitress that night, I guess I shouldn't expect great service. Actually, I blame it on the dim lighting/atmosphere as I believe it must have took a toll on the waitress mentally as well as the night went on.  Fourth, the food was not impressive at all.  I ordered the Scottish Steak Pie hoping it would be decent because this is a Scottish restaurant afterall and the pie was terrible.  Sauce was not flavorful at all, the steak was very chunky and rough and the potato didn't taste good.  The only positive I have for this restaurant and deserves the 1 star I am giving is because when I asked for a recommendation on a light beer, the waitress recommended the Innis & Gunn Lager and I really enjoyed it.  Overall, if you are on a date and/or you are into whisky, with their wide selections of whisky, you will find one that is for you."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm Scottish, maybe it's the insane selection of great Scotch, maybe it's the wonderfully prepared comfort foods or maybe it's the people who work there who are always so welcoming.  At the end of the day it's a great spot, I highly recommend it to anyone for a night out or even to sit at the bar have a wee dram after a long work day. I could sit there all day and keep ordering the haggis balls, sausage roll and Scotch egg plate.   We have enjoyed Burns Supper night and there are many evenings of Scotch tastings offered regularly.  There is a hidden gem of an outdoor patio for summer sipping and dining.   But don't just take my word for it, get yer arse over there!"}
{"text":"A taste of Scotland. Once you are inside, feels like being in a pub in Edinburgh. Great ambience and a great menu. OMG the haggis. Loved it. Reminded me of the time I first had haggis at the Whiskey Bar in Edinburgh. Great chips and curry."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places that we found to hold a party for about 20 people without having to pay extra or book a separate room!  They do have a back room for whiskey tasting events that you can do if you wanted to.  The space isn't huge, but you can fit a lot of people in here.  The drinks are lovely, the bartender even made some shots for us that were on the sweeter side..which of course must have been a bit difficult since they don't carry a wide variety of other types of alcohol.   A few people decided to try some of the food (I did not so I can only say they said it was good - I think haggis was tried and the steak pie).    The Scotch menu is extensive! If you are not sure then just ask!  You can learn a lot from the servers, who by the way were so nice to our large group!  Always with a smile and we never had to wait long to get food/drinks.  Parking is a pain in the a$$ around here, that's my only negative comment - you may have to end up getting ripped off by parking at the Metro about a 7 min walk away ($20!!)."}
{"text":"The Caledonian is the ideal place to channel your inner haggis. I had a lot of fun here. Friendly people, good food, huge variety of whiskeys and ales, guys walking around in kilts saying unintelligible things to one another. I tried a couple of the single malts and a rich Scottish ale that hurt my head the next day. The servers were enormously helpful and friendly, and even the patrons chimed in with recommendations. A very comfortable bar to sit at and I wish it was in my neighbourhood. The food is reasonably priced. I tried the Taste of Scotland platter. Loved the sausage roll and the Scotch egg. The haggis tasted like intestines or something. Actually, I didn't hate the haggis but I can't see ordering it again on purpose.  A great place!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I shared the fish and chips,  mac n cheese, fried pickles...and scotch flight.   It was all very good.  The waitress disappeared a few times, but the bartender/owner(?) was great and knowledgable about the scotch.   (it was very loud, but I'm sensitive to noise - it didn't bother my 27 year old daughter :)"}
{"text":"Decent food and large portions. We are really stuffed by the end of dinner and could hardly finish. We ordered the haggis, steak pie, and the appetizer platter. Staff was friendly, atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Best Scottish pub in Toronto. Dave and Donna are amazing. Great spot for tastings and their whisky selection is fantastic. If you're in the area it doesn't disappoint.   5/5 *"}
{"text":"Ordered the Fish and Chips, Scotch Egg and Deep Fried Pickles followed it all up with coffee and a Deep Fried Mars bar.  The place was packed but they were super accommodating and got us a table quickly. Service was friendly the entire night and we were checked up on often.   All of the food we ordered was amazing. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of weeks since we went to The Caledonian, but I felt I should share my thoughts.  I was there with Patty H (her review is also here) and was eager to let my new friends in Toronto sample some of the Scottish foods I had been ranting on about !   Firstly, I would say the atmosphere and décor was very similar to a number of Scottish Pubs back home... there was also a good selection of Scottish booze based beverages, but sadly no Irn Bru :(    We ordered quite a selection from the menu, and let everybody dig in.  The food was served in pretty good portions. My penny pinching Scottish upbringing made me think you didn't quite get all you paid for with some of the portions, especially the Scotch Egg.  Unfortunately I felt the Haggis lacked a little authenticity.  It wasn't as spicy as I would have expected and I would have preferred a loser texture too.  I have never been served a slice of haggis, unless its then been fried and served on the side of dish or on a roll.  The gravy, was also unexpected. White turnip, rather than brightly coloured neeps? I guess it had been toned down for the Toronto market , and they did what they could with the ingredients to hand ?  All in all, it felt like a wee spot of Scotland in Toronto and it was an enjoyable brunch."}
{"text":"I am not a whiskey aficionado and the selection of whiskey is staggering.  The first time I came I had the smokey and peaty flight and all were delicious.  On my return I asked for their recommendations and again was not disappointed.  Also, had the Fiddich Mac cocktail, (whiskey, ginger wine and lime), and it was delicious.  This seems like a place with a lot of regulars, very friendly and the bar staff knew a lot of people's names.  The food was also good, on my last visit I had the smoked salmon served with potato and avocado salad.  On my first trip, I had the sampler platter with sausage rolls, haggis bites and something else I can't remember.  Both were great."}
{"text":"Awesome fish and chips.  Also tried haggis for the first time there, it was pretty good and went well with they're large beer selection."}
{"text":"I've gone a few times for drinks, tried the food for the first time yesterday. I had the 4 cheese baked mac & cheese. It was incredibly rich with roasted garlic and grape tomatoes mixed in, and pretty much put me in a food coma. My partner had the steak pie. Pie crust was light and flaky, meat was tender, fries came with a side of curry sauce.   But lets face it, you're here for the Scotch. And if you're not sure about Scotch, this is a great place to learn. Extensive Scotch menu ranging from the affordable 10 year olds to some very expensive, premium 25 year olds, and everything in between. If you're indecisive or still learning, there are some interesting flights at the back of the menu that again range from an accessible try ($19 or so), to the super premium ($100 or so). If you're not sure, just ask the staff.  Not a Scotch drinker? Shame on you. (Although I think I was the only woman sipping Scotch last night.) There is a short but creative cocktail list focused on more mature offerings with quality Scotch, instead of bar rail sludge. Beer list is succinct and focuses primarily on Scottish offerings, including draft Innis & Gunn (yum!) and Tennants stout.  Back patio is huge in the summer.  There's also a \"keyholder\" system, where you can leave a premium bottle of Scotch with them and drink it whenever you come. Keyholders include the likes of Ron Sexsmith.  We come here whenever the dude wants to be spoiled with Scotch options he cannot get or afford at the LCBO.   Our waitress gave us a free deep fried Mars bar on the house, since my partner was celebrating his birthday. Or maybe it's cause we racked up a $200 tab? Whatever, it was a really nice touch.  Someone actually busted out bagpipes while we were waiting at the bar for our table, and played a few songs.  Wide range of clients. We're youngish (late 20s, early 30s), we saw some patrons younger than us, and some old enough to be our distinguished grandparents."}
{"text":"I'm all about atmosphere and this place has it: friendly, inviting, comfortable, it's like I was stepping into someone's house. It's all Donna's doing. She's the proprietor of this establishment and once you step inside her bar, you're in her home. She will make sure that you're having a great experience. In fact, all of her staff offer the same level of customer service.   My first introduction to the Caledonian was on a Wednesday night and the bar was pretty busy for a weekday. Near the patio, a group of men and women of various ages were singing Scottish folk songs. This group meets once a month and if you happen to be there on the same night, it's such a beautiful thing to see and hear. I've been in love with the Caledonian ever since.   In terms of libation, the Caledonian doesn't fail at this. Their beer and whiskey lists is good. They have 10 draft beers, including KLB Raspberry wheat beer. But it might be worth your while to try one of the bottled imported beers from Scotland. My favourite is Alba Scots Pine Ale, which is a popular choice.   Their impressive scotch and whiskey menu includes Oban, Macallan, and all of the Glens you can think of.   Their menu is traditional Scottish fare but I've only had three of their items: Fish and chips made with a light beer batter; curry and chips; and my favourite, the Taste of Scotland platter. This platter is best to share with a friend and it includes a Scotch egg, Scottish oat cakes, apple smoked Scottish cheddar and haggis balls.   Mmm, haggis...   If the idea of eating stuffed sheep's stomach doesn't scream \"yummy\" in your head, then try a haggis ball. They're small and you can always share it with friend. It's not as gross as you think and it doesn't look anything like the food you would stab on Robbie Burns' Day.   So, go ahead. Try it.  ===  Woot! Woot! My 200th post!"}
{"text":"Excellent server who knew her stuff. She was very knowledgeable about the food on the menu and took time to explain it. Also the unbelievable Scotch menu!! We tried the Taste of Scotland and it was fabulous. Looking forward to returning many times."}
{"text":"Come for the scotch eggs, stay for the whiskey flight!  The Caledonian is probably one of the top bars in Toronto. Seating can get difficult during peak times, but if you manage to nab a spot, expect great food with a stellar selection of whiskey.  The scotch eggs are the star of the show. I could eat these without stopping for so much as a breath, but if you must try other foods, the fish and chips and pie were both hits. The haggis fritters where interesting. I don't regret trying them, but I'm not sure whether I'd ever order them again. Especially in the face of such scotch egg greatness.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Mac and Cheese  I get that they put the half cherry tomatoes in there but I just think it would have been more risqué had they put the entire cherry tomato in and not halved it."}
{"text":"Always good place for food and a drink, no matter what night of the week it happens to be."}
{"text":"What a great place.  Went on a Friday night with a buddy and it was packed.  We shared the egg appetizer which was good.  For the main we both had the Hagis and loved it.  For dessert I had the sticky pudding which was amazing while my buddy had the deep fried mars bar which was also very good.  I also had a couple of their beers which were great.  On top of all that the service was really fantastic.  Well done Caledonian - keep up the great work.  I'm definitely coming back with more friends."}
{"text":"This is a mid-size place in the heart of little Italy in TO. It was also victim to the entire street being under construction, so the side walk was torn up in front of it.   Went in with a good friend for a cool one & some food. I ordered the Fish & Chips. Nothing special about the food. Just regular pub-grub. Portion size was just middle of the road too. The owner was very pleasant & the wait staff were attentive. Nothing bad to say about the whole thing!"}
{"text":"Real cool whiskey bar. Tons of of choices. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here during the winter for a drink and the place was totally packed. We were shocked by the crowd and intrigued by the menu, so we came back to try the food.  We sat out in the lovely half-covered back patio. Ordered the burger, steak pie, and mac and cheese. Everyone really liked their food - the fries were great, and the pastry on the steak pie was perfectly flaky. I'd say it was pub food done simply and done well. The food isn't a high concept interpretation of traditional pub food, a trend that  has become recently popular, although the modest prices reflect that. Three people with five drinks ended up being  $100 after the tip.  What makes The Caledonian really stand out is the service. Our waitress was easy-going, friendly, and attentive, and the owner checked on us and chatted briefly as we were leaving."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Caledonian since January (my one and only time) and I was welcomed like it had been just last week since I'd been there.  We sat at the bar and Beth took good care of us.  We ordered the mac and cheese and a Scottish egg and they were good.  There were Scottish dancers which were very entertaining.  What a nice place ... I'm going to make it a point of getting there more often."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because my Scottish friend want to try out 'haggis' in Toronto.   We made a trip to come here for brunch on Sunday.  We have a party of 5, we ordered, Haggis, Neeps and Tatties, Scotch Egg, Scotch Fry, The Caledonian Burger, Fish& Chip as meals to share. We also ordered Deep-Fried Mars Bar and  Bread and Butter Pudding as dessert.  First of all, my Scottish friend was not very fond of the haggis. He said no one would ever serve haggis with gravy on top. The neeps (turnips) are usually color yellow in UK, but here is white?!? Also $14 for this dish is a bit over the top.  2nd, the scotch fry, which comes with blood pudding. The blood pudding was REALLY dry. The rest is tasty and A-OK.  The Scotch Egg, it was tasty. However, $8 for just ONE egg, then again, it's abit over the top.  The fish & chips are excellent. The burger's beef patties is very dry.  We ordered deep fried mars bar and bread and butter pudding as dessert. Deep fried mars bar is interesting, extremely sweet. (Do not try to eat this dish by yourself, you need two ppl, because it's too sweet!). Also, $7 for ONE deep fried mars bar? That is also on the expensive side.  Bread and butter pudding is very dense. It is too dense for my Scottish friend. He never thought the pudding would be 'that thick and dense'.  Overall, we have 5 people, and the bill comes to be around $27 dollars. Very expensive for brunch for sure.  Other than the prices, I think the food is well presented, the waitress is very nice and they answer and listen to our question and request patiently.  But would I come here again? If they make the price $3 dollar cheaper, sure."}
{"text":"Don't sit out in the patio if you're not under a covering! There are a ton of birds there (lots of trees) and you will get pooped on constantly. That or your food gets pooped on. Terrible. Tried the fish and chips and was not impressed. Fries were limp, not crispy at all. Coating on the fish was not at all crispy either. Quite a basic fish & chips. Owner is lovely though. Would not try again."}
{"text":"We love this local restaurant!  Wonderful atmosphere and very welcoming owner. This time around we tried the burger, fish and chips and curry. Great burger bun, nice patty and fresh lettuce, onion and tomato. Thin-cut fries well cooked. Fish batter is lovely - light in texture, airy and a really big serving of fish. Butter chicken was well executed - good flavour and the right hint of spice.   Service is very attentive and pleasant. Great selection of beer and - it goes without saying - Scotch!  Wait for food was long, but such is life."}
{"text":"Awesome. I loved the wiskey flights. I loved the special \"bacon wrapped meatloaf\". Waitress was very wiskey knowledgeable, prompt and pleasant. Will definately return with friends."}
{"text":"The Caledonian isn't your average pub.  It's more of an upscale whiskey bar, with some fantastic dishes to boot. The real draw here though, is the staff.  Every time I've come here I have been treated like family.  Unbelievably warm and inviting.  It's as if they've known you for years, even when you're walking through the door for the first time.  I haven't received service like this anywhere else, and that's saying something!  I'm not brave enough to try the Haggis, but I've had the Fish & Chips on a few occasions and it's as good as it gets.  Up there with that of Fresco's (love them!), albeit a little more expensive.  It's a giant piece of haddock with a home-made tartar sauce and the frites are also delicious.  Compliment this dish with an Innis & Gunn (whiskey infused beer) and you've got yourself a winning combination.  Seriously delicious... if only it wasn't a high-calorie dish, I'd eat this every day!  Kudos to this fine establishment!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing if you love scotch and want to consume it alongside some tasty Scottish noshes!  I heard about this place on Yelp when they hosted the Robbie Burns Supper. I wanted to go but they sold out, which--along with the solid 4-5 star reviews--led me to believe this place was awesome.  I made it here eventually anyway on a nice, cool night and sat on the patio. A couple of friends and I split the Taste of Scotland plate which included haggis, scotch egg and sausage roll. If I can say I have a favourite type of pub food it's definitely Scottish pub food!  For my main I got the beer battered fish and chips. I felt that maybe there weren't enough of the chips part, but maybe that's because they were so good. I asked for curry sauce on the side and though it deviated from the whole Scottish thing, was still a great complement to the fries. My friends got burgers which they seemed to enjoy.  The BEST parts of the whole experience were the scotches as well as the lovely service. The lovely Scottish lady was very friendly and helped me pick out some drams. The waitress was also great too. They seemed to be very attentive even though the place was busy on a Friday night.  I tried two scotches. The first one I ordered was a Speyside single malt, the Glenrothes 1985 Vintage. I wanted to order a scotch that I could say was older than me! It was delicious!!! So smooth and sweet. I asked for ice on the side but I ended up drinking it neat, and was extremely sad when it was all gone. Not sad enough to order another one. At $16.50 per shot you can't get carried away!  Scotch #2 was an Islay single malt, the Ardbeg 10-year. This one was also very delicious! Very smokey and peaty, but it also had more complex flavours to offer than just smoke and peat. I have the Lagavulin 16-year at home and wanted to try something different, and the lovely Scottish lady suggested I try the Ardbeg 10-year. It was cheap in comparison to many of the others listed. I was shocked I liked it so much.  I love the smokiness and peatiness of Islay malts and they have since been deemed my favourites, although I also love the sweet, complex and spicy flavours of Speyside and Highland scotches like the Glenrothes 1985 Vintage, Oban 14-year and Cragganmore 12-year.   All of my scotch experiences have made me want to visit Scotland so bad! It'll be my next big trip!  All the hipsters can keep sippin' their bourbon; it means more scotch left more me!"}
{"text":"Best pub in Toronto! Great food and beer selection too.  We are vegetarian and just wish there was more on the menu besides mac and cheese.  But it is VERY good mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Deeericious fish! Great little Scottish pub; knowledgable and friendly staff with a nice sense of community (events, etc.). Good home-style food; everything is made-in house including the very tasty tartar sauce. Great drink selection and good atmosphere. I recommend making a reservation in advance! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in as a place to wait for our seat at Isabel to open and didn't expect much. Found out that the fish and chips is a winner! And the Caledonian beer is pretty tasty, too."}
{"text":"Even though so many pubs in Toronto claim some kind of British Isles heritage, The Caledonian is \"the only authentic Scottish pub\" in the city. So if you get a hankering for some haggis, neeps and tatties, scotch eggs, deep fried Mars bars or sticky toffee pudding, this is probably the best place for it. I hear the fish and chips are good too. I had the braised beef short ribs with crispy onion, mash and green beans from their daily menu. It was pretty much flawless. So tender and flavourful. I could actually taste the subtle hint of Innis and Gunn the beef was braised in. Dona, who I presumed to be the owner, checked up on us frequently. She looked exactly like Princess Merida from Brave and had a thick Scottish accent! The whiskey collection is incredible. The beer is not as extensive as I had expected. Aside from some good Canadian stuff like Creemore and Wellington, they have some Scottish choices like Tennent's and Innis & Gunn. If you're planning a visit, check their daily specials on Facebook."}
{"text":"This place is a whiskey lovers wet dream.  The wall behind the bar is drowned in whiskey from floor to ceiling. It was the first stop on our Yelp Dufferin Grove bar crawl so I took it easy and went with a basic rye and diet. I liked the vibe of this place. Nice and relaxed, great atmosphere.  It was a little odd that there was a rather large group of people standing in the middle of the bar, not sitting at the bar, and blocking the entire path for the serving staff. I would expect this to happen if the bar was busy but there were more than enough tables open for this group to grab a seat and get out of everyone's way.

{"text":"Whiskey!! A whole Wall of Whiskey at The Caledonian!!   I should have order one of those instead of a beer... definitely next time.  There are quite a few Scottish draft beer in the menu. The Tennent's Lager I ordered which is the best selling pale lager in Scotland was well balanced: crisp with a hint of malt.  The crowd here tonight was quite mix: with families and even a table of seniors with their party hats on at the back room.  Haggis Fritters any one? Thanks for Vivek for sharing his deep fried haggis with a smokey whiskey sauce.  I guess deep fried makes everything tastes better?! It was not gamy at all but has this funny texture of sticking to my mouth.  Service here is top notch! Our server is courteous and efficient and always check in on us.  The Caledonian is surprisingly busy even on a weeknight?! I wondering how it would be on a Friday or Saturday night!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite whisky bars in Toronto! Donna and the staff at The Caledonian are very joyful and very knowledgeable about their trade and every experience I've had here has been a joy. The biggest plus goes to their tastings which are always a joy to go to with friends and family and to have a meal and some good whisky while getting a personal dose of knowledge on the world of whisky! The only qualm I have is that the food at times, especially appetizers, are a tad pricey but even then their haggis and special entrees are hard to beat! Definitely give them a try if you are ever in the Ossington area!"}
{"text":"After reading countless reviews and curious to try haggis I finally made it here and was not disappointed. Started with the taste of Scotland and fried pickles which aren't to be missed. Main was the haggis which again was fantastic. Great food, welcoming staff and overall fantastic atmosphere makes this a destination not to be missed."}
{"text":"We ventured out to the Caledonian last weekend after dinner at a nearby restaurant. The place was really busy, but we were lucky to grab a couple of seats at the bar. We were greeted by a couple of really friendly and outgoing bartenders/servers. We had a great time, while my boyfriend was tasting their scotch and I sipping on delicious prosecco. We didn't eat, but were sallivating at the sight of the dishes being served. We are definitely going back for dinner soon.  Carly was bartending that night and was totally awesome! Watching her work, was impressive. She is fast, knowledgable, and super friendly. Despite being really busy getting drinks onto the floor, she never let down on superb service to her clients at the bar. Thanks Carly for making our first visit memorable!!"}
{"text":"I love the haggis here!   Warm atmosphere, nice menu that isn't too complicated. They do what they do well. Recommended."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for date night. The standing rating already speaks for itself. what a great dining experience.   Food- we each ordered an entree since we came here after a snack and drink down the street. I got the Mac and cheese and my SO got the steak pie w frites. My Mac and cheese was amazingly creamy, very flavourful and cheesy, great crust on top, and the portion was very large. I have a bit of a love affair for Mac and cheese (maybe because growing up it wasn't something we ever are but I digress...) and this gooey rendition w cherry tomatoes was wonderful. The SO got a steak pie which is essentially bites of steak in a Guinness sauce covered w a puff pastry and fries on the side. He loved it, and I was immediately transported back to Scotland when I tried it. We were both very happy w our dishes. They were under $18 to boot as well so we can't go wrong here. The prices are very reasonable.  We ended off w a deep fried mars bar - enter Homer Simpson drool sound - melt in your mouth, sweet and rich. Great to share.   Drinks- I ordered the Whisky caeser and I was pretty happy with it. I've never had a drink like it that's for sure. Essentially whiskey, clamato and horseradish, no salt rim or any toppings tho. The whiskey was incredibly peaty and it came thru with each sip of the drink. It's not my Favorite Caesar in the city but it was good and i would i give them points for the inventive combo.    Service- wonderful. The place was PACKED. We managed to get a table within 2 mins tho and the waitress was just on point. She checked on us, was prompt in everything we asked for, asked if we wanted more drinks etc. most importantly she was really friendly and was really good at her job. What I described above is apparently too much to do sometimes in some too cool for school joints.   Resto- great lighting, very romantic. Vibe was friendly and just a place full of great ppl. Comfortable and perfectly warm durig these cold months. Not pretentious at all. Dark wood features and a beautiful well stocked bar. There's a tv on in the corner as well showing replays of the Olympics.    We were happy to pay for that meal as it so worthwhile and the service was so nice. In the summers their patio is one of the best on the city IMHO (see pic)"}
{"text":"My first trip the Caledonian was a bit of a mixed bag, and if Yelp had a 3.5 star rating, I'd be inclined to lean towards it.  However, I'm going to have to settle on a 3 star.   Ok on to the details.....  Our group showed up at the Caledonian later in the evening for a night-cap and was told that on Thursday's the bar has last call at 1am. With a statutory holiday looming on the next day, a few fellow Yelpers piped up to say, \"Even on Holy Thursday!?'   Yes...apparently even on Holy Thursday.   Considering the bar was fairly full with patrons looking to unwind (get drunk) without the worry of an early morning the next day it certainly came as a bit of a surprise, and I'm sure the Caledonian missed out on a boatload of extra revenue. On the bright side, the waitress was more then understanding and let us nurse our beers until 2 am. (Disclaimer: After writing that last sentence, I adjusted the Yelp rating to a 4. Must give credit, where credit is due.)  The atmosphere and feel of the Caledonian is great and while I can't speak for the food they offer, they've got a great patio out back that smells like rich, new MDF board (Disclaimer 2: I once worked at a woodworking factory. When you head out back, look up under the awning. That my friend is MDF board...and yes it was brand spanking new on my visit).   If the weather had of been a few degrees warmer I'm sure our group would have enjoyed our beers a little more. I can easily see this patio being a big hit come summer time and hopefully the scent of new MDF has subsided.  I'm looking forward to my next trek to the Caledonian this summer to enjoy a nice cold beer on the patio......I just hope that last call on the weekends is 2am!"}
{"text":"I have only been for drinks, I'll have to come back for food.  The location is an unusual hybrid of a Scottish pub and something... well, more upscale.  I am not sure what I thought of it.  I think of a pub and I am looking for something more relaxed and less stuffy.  I am not quite sure where it fits if I was looking for a place to go.  In all there was nothing bad about it, just felt a bit ambivalent about the space and experience.  I did like the chaser shot of pickle juice."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great scotch. Nice patio. What more is there to say? Try the Mac and cheese, and add bacon:)"}
{"text":"My father-in-law loves this place on Sundays for the full roast dinner. I am partial to the haggis fritters. Those are words I never thought I would say but I love haggis fritters.  The owner and her staff are fantastic. The only reason I am giving this a four is because they run out of the roast beef so quickly as they only have a certain amount available and sometimes the servers forget that I ordered mine with turnips instead of potatoes.  But I do highly recommend going there and enjoying a nice single malt scotch and some haggis. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Just had the fish and chips. Meh, not bad not good. However i did have it as take out and not eat in. Either way i found the fish and batter a bit bland and oily. The place itself is nice with a great little secluded back patio."}
{"text":"The draught beer selection is great ... and I tried a pint of Deuchars IPA . Try their Sausage Rolls ($7) which comes with 2 medium sized sausage rolls and a small amount of mixed greens salad.  My friend went for the the Highland Burger ($15) with shoestring fries ...it made me think that I should have worn my kilt. My girl had the Steak Pie ...kind of a UK thing. Then some pudding... you can't your meat without your pudding."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick snack and a drink. My fiancé and I ordered a Scotch egg, which was a first for both of us. It was quite good but didn't blow our minds the way we thought a boiled egg wrapped in meat, breaded and fried might. Our drink was a Monkey Shoulder which was merely okay. I like citrusy drinks, but the lime overwhelmed the other elements.  I would give this place 3.5 stars based on food/drink, but I'm bumping to 4 stars based on the beautiful outdoor seating area in the back."}
