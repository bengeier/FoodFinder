{"text":"Will never eat here again. Here's why... Ordered a plate with grilled pork, grilled beef and rice. From the moment the plate was put down in front of me, someting smelled rotten. It was the beef, the beef was very past date. I was hungry and it was late, so i took the beef out of my plate and ate what i deemed to be edible. Server came by, i told her the beef i was served was rancid, she did not seem to understand, and took off minus the rancid beef.  I go to pay, i tell the gentleman at the cash that i was served rancid beef. blank stare. I repeat the same thing in french...blank stare. I asked him if there was anyone here who spoke either french or english. A woman comes out of the kitchen, she con erses with the man for 5 minutes, the woman tells me that she will give me 50% off my next visit!? Ok, like i will ever come back to a restaurant that served me rancid beef, i told them they might want reduce the price of my dish seeing as how a portion of it was rancid. They babbled on for a few minutes, they seemed very reluctant to give me any sort of discount, out of frustration i paid FULL price and left. With all the great restaurants in Verdun, don't even bother with this place."}
{"text":"Leur Pho(tonkinoise) est excellent! Similaire à Pho Cali sur St-Laurent. Très bonne alternative pour le coin."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down by the Government! DIRTY! They serve rancid meat and do not follow proper hygiene techniques. It smells so awful inside. This is the dirtiest restaurant I have ever seen. We ordered something, then my girlfriend Googled it to check reviews. The article written by the Journal showed up and we pretended we had an emergency and ran out! I've never done that before. I feel bad for anyone who eats there and doesn't use the Internet!"}
{"text":"Bon endroit pour une soupe, et propose des combos rouleau + soupe + plat pour environ 10$. Parfait aussi pour emporter. !"}
{"text":"Pho Bac No1 won't be the best place you'll go to eat Vietnamese, but it's a decent restaurant. You don't go there for the venue, as it's a bit old.  The food is good, and the service is really quick. Good Viet in Verdun, and perfect for takeout."}
{"text":"I prefer to give my money to local restaurants versus ones in other neighborhoods or big chains! I am stating this, before I start writing this review, because I am trying to promote a local eatery (and not the best Pho place I have been to) .   Pho Bac No. 1 is certainly not the best Vietnamese place that you will eat at but it is pretty good none-the-less.  I like the service when I eat in house, and the delivery is fast and free.   The restaurant itself, looks like it is a Greek resto from the early '80's that had never renovated (and the building is reaching the 100 year old point soon); Posh it ain't. But, that doesn't affect the quality or the taste of the food. Which is all solid in term of being tasty and consistent.  The place usually has a few clients in-house and there is a constant stream of p/u orders.   So, if you're not venturing all the way to Chinatown, and you're looking for some decent Pho in the hood....give them a chance, I am sure that you will be pleasantly surprised!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not a good vietnamese by any standard. The Vietnamese spring rolls (not fried) were mostly filled with vermicelli, and the peanut sauce was peanut butter with a bit of cream (very solid).  One person with me ordered their shrimp brochettes, which very well could have come from La Casa Greque had it not been for the vermicelli on the side and for the fact that there were only 6 shrimps on her plate.   I ordered some stir-fried vegetables in a sauce, and the egg-white colored sauce was more reminiscent of a chinese eatery than a vietnamese restaurant. Which confused me even more because they also had papaya salad, clearly a thai dish.  The decor is very simple, and unassuming. Not \"date night\" material, but perhaps okay for a cheap meal if you're in the area and don't feel like going to a coffee shop or a diner. I would pass."}
{"text":"Honestly could be way better if they just added some new apps to the menu.  Added spices to their meats.  Less watery   It's to generic to actually enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing place ! It's good & it's cheap & you can get an entree, a dish and a dessert for less than 15$ The only problem is they accept credit card & I never have any cash on me.  The service can be quite long sometimes though because there is only one waitress for the whole restaurant. So don't go if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"A fine Pho in Verdun.  My favorites Pho places in Montreal are near the \"Marché Jean-Talon\" but since it is a bit far from home and we love Pho we decided to give this neighborhood place a try.  Our goal was Pho so that's what we had and it was good. We also tried the spring rolls and imperial rolls but these were very average.  I wouldn't cross town to come here but if you want good Pho in the Verdun area this place is good... and stick to the Pho!"}
{"text":"This place was recently slapped with almost $7000 in fines for health code violations. Don't eat here.... Unless you want food poisoning and a lousy meal!"}
{"text":"Whoa whoa whoa guys. Some of y'all can be pretty harsh when reviewing a place... maybe i'm just too forgiving but i thought it was well worth 4 stars ...at least my experience today. Or maybe y'all put the bar so low that I just think it was amazing 'cuz I was expecting the worst.   A colleague of ours is being transferred out of our team, so one of our team planned a thank you / good bye lunch...they chose Pho Bac. Being a yelp addict I checked out the other reviews last night: dammmmmmnnnn,  was I ever dreading this lunch!  Much to my, super pleasant, surprise: not at all what the other reviews had me expecting. The place was clean, very clean even...ok the floors and the bathrooms not-so-clean...but tables, utensils, dishware etc (the part that counts)...hell even the fish tank... were all shiny shiny.   It took a good 15 minutes before our waiter first came to see our table of 8...which I was expecting based on the reviews. But surprisingly all courses of the meal were served in a very timely and efficient manner, super appreciated!! The soups came out within 5 mins of completing our order...then next the spring rolls also within 5 minutes of finishing the soups and the meals following closely behind picking up the empty spring roll plates.   The food itself was actually delicious, beautifully cooked and NOTHING was rotten! I will definitely be back for their won ton soup: best I've ever had anywhere (with a lil sriracha n soy sauce obviously)!!!!!! The beef n chicken combo were amazing but a lil on the overbearingly sweet side: which is the only part worth complaining about and even that...a nice glass of dry red wine (cuz it is a byow) woulda fixed that right up! (They put limes in the water jug which was awesome at first but just added to the sweetness aspect once the meal came).   So overall: don't be so mean! I didn't get sick and neither did my colleagues, go ahead n give 'em a chance: the food n price is worth it! And if you find a better won ton soup: please let me know!!"}
{"text":"Pour une fan finie de Soupe Tonkinoise, j'aime bien aller chez Pho Bac No1. C'est pas cher, le service est toujours très sympatique, c'est à quelques minutes de la maison et le bouillon de la tonkinoise est juste fantastique. Les rouleaux impériaux aussi, sont fous, ce sont pas mal les meilleurs que j'ai jamais mangé!  Quand je parle de pas cher, c'est vraiment pas cher. Je m'en sort toujours aux alentours de 12-13$ tip inclus. Je prends la soupe médium, poulet et légumes avec un rouleau impérial."}
{"text":"The other weekend I was jonesing for some Vietnamese chow. And the only place i'd ever heard of in my new area was Pho Bac No.1. So shot in the dark, I gave it a try. Well it's done and I ain't never ordering again.  There was this pork soup. It was horrible. The pork bits, and I normally LOVE pig meat, looked like little turds floating in a bouillon that tasted like soapy dirty dish water. After 2 spoonfuls I was DONE with that soup.  I had the beef and chicken combo, I went for safe stuff, but then these utilitarian restaurants never offer much more than this. The chicken was dry and crunchy. The beef was a really cheap cut and tasted boiled more than it did grilled. The noodles, well I tasted Ramen noodles in my student days that tasted better than this. And the whole dish needed to be sandstormed with salt to give just a little taste.  The only thing that tasted like anything was the spring roll which was plural on the menu, I was wondering where the second one was. And it only tasted good once thoroughly dunked in the dipping sauce.  And I don't even know if it's an authentic dish from Viet-Nam or not but most Vietnamese restaurants serve Fried Bananas and boy do I love those. I love bananas and then the idea of deep frying them and dipping them in syrup, well that's just awesome but I digress. I ordered the Fried Bananas anyway and that also was a mistake. They tasted pre-fab out of a box and the syrup was made with Maple Syrup. I had no clue that the Vietnamese had maple syrup as part of their culture nor that Viet-Nam was part of North-America and that the Natives cultures taught them how to get the sap from the Maple... in Viet-Nam."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE! This restaurant was just fined a total of $6,100 this year for more than once not complying with safety rules, keeping the place in unsanitary conditions and for absolutely disgusting and dangerous practices.  Check out the article below and see the horrifying pictures taken from inspectors. \"Rotting meat\", \"putrefaction\", \"foul odors\", \"disgusting smell\", \"all covered with a layer of black grime easily detachable\" are a few of the things described.   http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2014/11/21/le-gras-degouttait-de-la-hotte  I went to this place once and I plan on never, ever, coming back."}
{"text":"Dirty bathrooms. I wonder about the kitchen. Food was ok at best."}
{"text":"Grotesquely large chunks of fat in their \"Dac biet\" aka \"tout garnie\" or all dressed. Read awful reviews about this place on yelp but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Broth tasted as if it was watered down with tapwater because I can literally taste the tap in a broth that should have already been pre-boiled and seasoned which does not make sense. I literally had to put extra Hoison sauce and Sriracha sauce to mask the tap water taste. Never again."}
{"text":"Quand il fait froid et qu'il pleut, c'est inévitable: il me faut de la soupe vietnamiène pour me réchauffer. C'est donc en cette première journée froide d'automne que j'ai décidé d'aller au Pho Bac No 1 pour satisfaire mon envie de pho au boeuf.  J'y suis allée avec mon copain l'australien et nous sommmes arrivés à 17h pile, juste à temps pour l'ouverture de la soirée et nous étions seuls pendant lamajorité de notre souper bien que quelques personnes sont venues pour des commandes à emporter. Le service a donc été assez rapide tout en nous laissant assez de temps pour décider quoi manger, et nous donner une petit pause entre l'entrée et le repas principal.  L'australien et moi avons optés pour le choix \"A\" qui consiste simplement à un rouleau impérial et un grand bol de soupe au boeuf. Le rouleau était bon, remplis de morceaux de légumes et boeuf et frit correctement. La soupe était très chaude sans être bouillante et la viande bien cuite et avec très peu de gras donc très bonnes. Les fèves germées avaient l'air un peu triste et probablement juste un peu trop vieille pour être servies dans un resto, puis la sauce chili était étrangement liquide. La sauce pour le rouleau impérial est aussi très \"fade\" et ne goûte pas grand chose.  Somme toute, un repas correct, bien pour se réchauffer l'intérieur sans de fla-fla. Et comme m'a dit l'autralien: \"Learn to slurp in style!\""}
