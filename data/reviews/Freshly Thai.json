{"text":"I work down the road from Freshly Thai and it has become my goto restaurant. The staff are very friendly and the food is always hot, fresh, and most importantly, tasty. Beware of the spicy heat rating though. I love spice but the spicy pad Thai letter ally made me cry while I ate it. My Co - workers laughed at me. The meal was still amazing, don't get me wrong. Just remember that spicy is for those who were born with a chili pepper in their mouth ;)"}
{"text":"Had the chicken pad Thai; it was really great and flavorful. And the portion is huge, so bring your appetite! 

The Satay chicken was really great as well, lots of great flavours. 

Fair prices and friendly staff. During the day it is not busy so I got a seat right away, and the food came really fast too."}
{"text":"This place use to be good, not anymore. The vegetables in the chicken curry now consist of potatoes and onions :(  . Gone are the peppers, broccoli, etc. Soooo disappointing!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food. Fresh and very tasty.  Menu very accommodating for vegans.  Service can be a bit slow sometimes, so we tend to get takeout.  Calling ahead works very well for that.  Addicted to their Freshly Thai Squash Soup!"}
{"text":"Was delighted to find a Thai restaurant and have eaten here a few times. The restaurant is quaint and nicely decorated.  There is only one lady ever working, waiting on tables, ringing up take-out orders, running back and forth from the kitchen, etc.  She's friendly but frazzled.  Aside from taking my order and dropping off my food, I never see her again.  Don't expect another shot at asking for salt or water or anything else. Service is pretty non-existent.  When it's time to pay, just walk up to the front because the cheque will never come otherwise. 

I usually order the massaman curry which is my favourite Thai dish. It was a little on the sweet side and not as flavourful or rich.  The soup had crisp fresh vegetables in it so that was nice. Dessert, I will say, was amazing. Sticky rice with mango.  

If they just hired even one person to help out during lunch hour, this place could be excellent."}
{"text":"A small restaurant with a great patio, authentic decor, excellent food and awesome service. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Service is a little strange 
But to be expected in a place like this 
They may get your order wrong so clarify your order 
But the food is GREAT! 
never disappoints 
Order the Thai lettuce wraps anytime you can 
Mango salad is great 
Tom yum soup is great 
Green curry is great 
But definitely definitely order the lettuce wraps"}
{"text":"Cute decor and space. Friendly service. Food was ready quickly for take out and the price was reasonable. I like spice,  but I found their dishes to be a touch hotter than typical North American thai fare... Including their chicken pad thai. Be warned if spicy isn't your thing. Amazing mango salad tho! Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for a fair priced dining option with a bit of ambience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with one. We ordered a Pad Thai and green curry (I think it was)? The food was good though I've had better. Service was attentive and the server was really nice! I would return for a quick grab to eat (if I'm in the area) but not very often.

Parking can be a nightmare, I had to circle around the block twice before I could find a spot."}
{"text":"Even the website offers the option to text in a take out order, DON'T DO IT. I did that today, and when I went in to pick up my food, I was told that they didn't \"hear\" the text coming in. Like any restaurant, ambient noise is likely to cover many sounds, including text message notifications. This means that the restaurant doesn't actually check the messages, and of course, if they can't hear the notification, your order won't get made. 

Why offer any conveniences when it winds up wasting everyone's time?

I'm sure the food is fine - I wouldn't know. They didn't make my order."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is fresh and delicious. I eat here all the time, especially in the summer on the patio. It's owned by three sisters who are always there working hard and making personal connections to their customers. They see me walk in and know my order, how nice is that?! Large portions too, I always have enough for lunch the next day. It's great to support a small, local, family owned and and operated business (that also has great food)!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little Thai place. It is the only place I have tried so far in Brampton and it was completely edible. I would go back again, but I will probably keep seeking out other restaurants until I find one. 

Admittedly I am spoiled when it comes to Thai food. I've been to Thailand but my local Thai restaurant in Colorado Springs (of all places!) run by Thai's, is the best Thai food I have had. Better than anything we had in Thailand and much better than this place in Brampton, Freshly Thai. 

I prefer a strong and thick creamy curry. I ordered my curry \"Thai Hot\" which is the spiciest they give, and when I received it there was no spice to it at all. I had a little small sauce cup of spice, so I put that in which raised it up a little bit, but it still wasn't that spicy. The curry itself had a pretty good flavour but was more soupy than curry-y. 

The thai chicken eggrolls were very tiny and lacked much flavour. 

The chicken satay skewers were not tasty in my opinion. The sauce was more creamy than peanuty and the chicken again had little flavour. It is something I would expect from the middle of nowhere. Not from the best food parts of the world like the GTA. If this restaurant was in Kentucky, it would get 4-stars. The food is not bad, it is just sort of meh."}
{"text":"I wish I had read Jannies L's review prior. We went here for lunch today. I ordered the Basil chicken with rice and spring rolls and wife had an order of spring rolls with Mango pinapple iced tea.

Spring roll's filling wasn't distinguishable. It seemed like vegetables cooked and mashed together before filling them in the rolls. The rolls were tasteless as was the watered down plum sauce served with it.

Basil chicken was supposed to be spicy but it was far from it. There was hardly any sauce with the dish. It was beans, onions and green pepper in just a little bit of water with chilli-flakes sprinkled on top. There was no flavour to the dish at all.

The Mango pineapple green tea seemed like the two juices mixed together with equal portion of water served with ice. There was no tea in Mango Pineapple green tea.

Our water was refilled a couple of times. But no one came to ask if the food tasted okay. When we were paying we complained about the food being very bland we were asked if we would like some soy sauce :-)

Not going there again even with the gun to my head. Horrible!"}
{"text":"Good food and good options. Good prices. Friendly staff. At times service could be speedier, but you always feel full and happy with what you ordered."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. The service less so.

Food's priced well. It's flavorful and fresh. When I ask for spicy, they (usually) make it spicy. I really enjoy rice paper rolls/salad rolls, and I like theirs bunches! They make them just how I like them. For an entree I usually get a noodle dish, such as pad seew or basil noodles, but I dig the green curry as well.

The service is super friendly, but it's so, so, sloooow. We would go here more often for casual weekday fare if the service were quicker. Recommended, though, overall."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! I only ever get take out, but the people I order from are always so pleasant. I like to order something that they recommend! I've had a lot of food from here, I love their soups, and curry.. Very tasty! And spicy :) prices are amazing, too! It's cheaper for me to go here, than mcds to feed my family of 5!"}
{"text":"Reliable Thai food. Always fresh and tasty. Fair prices."}
{"text":"Came here with my family. We ordered the freshly Thai platter (the spring rolls were delicious!) as well as the honey garlic beef, chicken pad thai, delicious scallops, fried fish with tamarind sauce (can't remember the name) and a fish curry. We asked that the fish curry and scallops be spicy, but they were quite mild. The honey garlic beef however was really spicy! My brother couldn't handle it. 

The service was so slow! We had to ask them for cutlery as they didn't provide any for us and that took forever. Overall the food was good, but I probably wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Worth a try. Offers authentic thai food, nothing overly spectacular but decent enough to crush that thai cravings."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer to this restaurant since it opened, but I am sad to say the service at my last visit is the reason I will never return. I ordered takeout for my family at least once every week and thought I would bring some of my friends from out of town to try the food I've been raving about. I brought in 10 potential new customers and was just shocked at the service we received. We were brought out one dish at a time to the point that the first had finished eating an hour before the last even got their food! I would understand if the place was super busy or they were short staffed, but our party was the only one in there. Almost every entree was incorrect or cold. So sad to see something like this. I spoke to the manager and she didn't even apologize let alone try to make it right. I will never return here again as it is clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for them anymore. You lost a loyal customer Freshly Thai!"}
{"text":"Excellent service very prompt and attentive, pad thai was great and recommend the fresh chicken spring rolls"}
{"text":"I pass by this restaurant many times in the past four years and I never tried it out. So I decided to grab dinner there last night. Not bad. I ordered pad Thai, and pineapple fried rice. The pad Thai is pretty good, I think it's better than Thai express. Pineapple fried rice on the other hand was a bit disappointing. The rice was overcooked and mushy. But I wanted it spicy, and the lady was nice to make it spicy for me. The price is moderate, and the portion was a bit too small for me, but I would come back again and I would recommend this restaurant. They have an outdoor patio which is awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place, I am a big fan of Thai food and have been to many places to eat and this is by far one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to. there portions are big, the food is delicious and the price is great. I had the green curry which was amazing and my boyfriend had the pad Thai which was also really good and didn't taste overly sweet and unauthentic like a lot of other places serving pad Thai. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"The 3 star rating is definitely for service (4 stars if it was only based on service)

When we first walked in the sign reminds me a bit of \"poutine dare to be fresh\" down the street, same neon green. It is west of main on queen and has its own tiny little parking lot (5-6 cars). Not a big place, maybe 7-8 tables and some were filled when we came in sans reservations (although it was a Thursday night, it did start to fill up by the time we left)

One of the waitress greeted us as soon as she saw us, and prompty seated us. the decor was nice, they have gold/black table clothes that felt very authentic. Minimalistic was the way they went with the decor, little touches (little Buddha, smaller pictures, 1 small red flower in a little candle holder that just made the ambiance a bit nicer to dine in)

The menu is vast for a thai place, with many sub headings, listed as pad thai, curry, soup, friend rice, all coming with choice of vegetable, chicken., beef, pork, tofu. This for me took away the authenticity of the place, it made me feel like I was ordering the same thing but in a different form, with everything falling under a category it didn't feel like each dish was made individually, just add the meat to a bowl in the back. Kind of like fast food... and I've never seen pork curry before :s

We had thai chicken spring rolls $5.95 to start, order came with six small ones, the filling is hard to describe since you can not identify any meat or any substance, it was black and mushy, no taste I can distinguish. The sauce that came with it helped carry it down. 

I asked for spicy on my hubby's chicken pad thai ($9.95), it was not spicy at all and the portion was a bit smaller than other places we've been.

I've had my share of Thai curries and what came out when I ordered the spicy beef green curry ($9.95) was neither spicy nor curry, very watery and the taste was lacking due to the excess water.

A friend had the red curry with beef and it came out similar to mine.

The other had the thai bbq chicken $10.95 (didn't know this existed) and in the words of my two friends \"they know chicken and that wasn't good chicken\" came out with a nice presentation but didn't smell like thai herb roasted chicken, couldn't smell it at all actually. 

We had a bottle of white wine 9they had to check if it was in stock, which makes me think they just run next door to buy one from the lcbo) They had to do the same with each beers my friends ordered, and they ran out of the first one after 1 bottle and recommended a second one. I understand small businesses keep their inventory low to avoid wasting food, but alcohol doesn't expire in a month or two so they shouldn't have their customers drink 3 different types of beers, based on recommendation of which ones they have. 

Another side note was the server spilled a beer on my friend, apologized and helped to wipe everything but there was about 1/6th of the beer left and she charged him full price for it. Which I didn't think was appropriate.

However like I said the service was great otherwise, we were old friends catching up for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours and we never felt any pressure to leave. 

I would go in if I was in the area and had a strong craving for thai (although bamboo garden is down the street) but won't trek my way west for it.

*** Tip
They also have lunch buffet, so you can go and try out most of their dishes. Also they have a pretty big patio so for $4.50 beers it wouldn't be a bad place to hang in the summer."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! This is my favourite Thai restaurant literally in the world.

Family run and very friendly, helpful service. All of the curries are super delicious that we have tried so far. I love the tom kha soup, which has a coconut milk broth, fresh mushrooms, and cilantro - YUM! The fish lover dish (Pla Rad Prik) was absolutely scrumptious, think fried crispy fish drizzled with a spicy sweet sauce. Another must try is the green curry with shrimps, so so flavourful and tasty!

I really like that the restaurant prides itself on being a healthier Thai experience, using less oil, palm sugars, and making everything fresh. Nothing I have eaten here is greasy at all and I dream about their food frequently, its so good!

I loved my first visit so much, we actually ended up taking my BF's mom with his family for her 50th birthday party earlier this month. The staff was super accommodating and also even gave us fried banana dessert with a candle in it to celebrate! It was a very sweet touch which was much appreciated!

Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I always eat here after my dentist appointment across the street. I usually order red curry with bamboo shoots and tofu and the spice level is on point and very filling. Worth saving left overs for. The people here really know their food and will answer any questions. One of the workers spent 5 minutes explained in detail about each of their different curries.
The people here seem to happy. And give off a positive atmosphere.
Watch out for the fried rice, the spice level caught me off guard (and i lived it since i persinally enjoy having spicy food)
Tom yum soups also good to order if your not too hungry and want something spicy and flavourful to go.
Im getting. Hungry just from thinking about it..."}
{"text":"Food and service was wonderful at this restaurant. Located in the heart of Brampton, we didn't expect to find authentic thai food. Parking is located at the front of the restaurant or on the street. There is also a parking building located behind the restaurant. We ordered the \"freshly thai\" platter to start and everything was very fresh and made to order. The chicken and beef skewers were seasoned well and the fresh roles were made to order. The curries are also delicious and have a balanced taste - not to spicy."}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian food.  I loved the taste of authentic Thai.  Excellent service. 
It's very small place but food was awesome."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic Thai food in Brampton is quite a task.  Usually when you find a place its usually a mixture of Vietnamese/Pho/Thai or Chinese/Thai.  Not to say that this isn't good...its just not the same as a place that specializes in traditional Thai recipes.  On recommendations for Yelp GTA Elites..I was directed to Freshly Thai with a guarantee of authentic Thai recipes and preparation. 

Located in the central core of downtown Brampton, not far from the main intersection of Queen and Hurontario, you will a find a somewhat out of place building in the middle of taller buildings in the core.  Freshly Thai is a family owned business and you can feel that welcome family feeling when you arrive.  We were greeted warmly and were quickly sat.  The dining room is not that large, but large enough for about 20 tables.  The menu has all the traditional Thai dishes that I love.  Red curry, Green Curry, Yellow Curry, Pad Thai, Khao Sao Kai (curry noodle soup) and other great dishes.  I ordered the Pineapple Curry Chicken with white rice with a Thai Chicken roll starter and the wife ordered the traditional Pad thai with Chicken.  Service was fast and friendly and when I went to use the restroom I passed by the kitchen and you can see the family working hard to prepare your meal.  Our meal arrived with beautiful cut vegetable flowers adorning my wife's Pad Thai and a generous portion of Pineapple Chicken curry in a bowl.  The taste was amazing and the flavours were right on target.  After our meal I ordered a \"Thai\" coffee (its served with condensed milk) to finish.  

All the recommendations and reviews were right...authentic Thai food...family owned...fast and friendly service.  5 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"People are very nice and friendly, huge selection on the menu.. lots of things to choose from. Overall food was good. The downfall was it was $15 for one dish, the seafood pad thai and was not alot of sea food. With that being said, I'd give the place a second chance but this time get something else."}
{"text":"Food
Definitely could be better. Small portions and the food was not hot when it came out.
Furthermore, this place was overpriced. 

Atomsphere 
Charming restaurant. Simple decorated. Probably 10-12 tables available. A little cold, especially by the door. We saw ppl asking to move. 
Parking was a little limited. But the city parking was not too far.  

Overall
Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I are clearly on a mission to test every gluten free offering in the Brampton area. After a quick google search we decided to check out Freshly Thai. We ordered over the phone (take-out) and arrived about 30 minutes later to pick up the food. The location was a little difficult to find and had a tiny parking lot (I think 5 cars max!) Thankfully a space was open so we could quickly run in. The staff was courteous and polite and our food was all ready to go. 

We had read through other comments that the portions were very small, so we ordered three (to share). We definitely did not need three. The portions were more than enough, but we saved what was left and had a nice lunch the next day. It all reheated quite well. 

We ordered the spicy thai basil noodles, freshly thai cashew/almond plate and the Pad-see-ew.  The cashew/almond plate was by far the best. 

My only real complaint was that there wasn't much meat in the dishes, and to just pay $10.95 for veggies and noodles/rice seems a bit much. Otherwise, very happy with our experience!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times and today I finally decided to pop in for a solo lunch. I feel very conflicted writing this review so let me start with the good.

This place is definitely family owned and run, which gives it a level of charm that most restaurants don't have. I overheard the bubbly waitress shevon (sorry for the spelling) greeting a customer by their first name. They have a variety of options for meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans. They also state that they use the freshest ingredients possible, make their tamarind sauce in house, no msg and they don't use fish sauce (vegans rejoice). 

I ordered the chicken wings and the Pineapple red curry. It was delicious and I don't have any complaints there either. It wasn't  the best I've ever had but it was definitely good and worth a second trip. I also like that they have a wide variety of tea selections because I love tea.

Now the bad... Definitely the slowest service I've ever had. I had to put money in my parking meter a second time because I was there for about 2 hours. The restaurant roughly sits about 40 people and i would guess there was always about 12-15 people seated.
 They couldn't handle it. Almost all the table were filled with dishes, the food wasn't coming out fast enough and the other waitress looked really stress. They were nice don't get me wrong but they were understaffed. I asked shevon if they are always this busy and she said on Fridays they are but 2 waitresses called in sick and some of the kitchen staff are on vacation. So I am definitely going to give them another try. But if the service doesn't improve I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We ordered take out, and got Chicken Pad Thai, Chicken Pad Sew-ee and Peanut chicken. The Pad Thai and Pad Sew were dry and flavourless, and we were quite dissapointed."}
{"text":"It taste like hospital food. No taste or flavour. The worst Thai I have ever tasted. I ordered the spring rolls and they tasted like they were previously frozen. The cashew nut chicken was watery and taste was poor."}
{"text":"I really like this place.
I find it super cozy, kind of chilly during the winter, but definitely cozy.
I actually like how they have their own little parking spots at the side of the restaurant, very convenient if you find a spot.
What my friend and I had ordered:
Thai Spring Rolls (Chicken)
Freshly Thai Rolls (Shrimp)
Shrimp Pad Thai
Massaman Curry with Beef

I really enjoyed the Fresh Rolls, would definitely order again.
As for the Massaman curry, this is a dish I typically order as it's my favourite curry. I found it really light in colour and not much flavour, it was okay. I would probably order another dish from there. 

My friend did like her Pad Thai, she did ask for extra sauce though. She thought it was not \"saucy\" enough.

Regardless, it's a really good place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Freshly Thai is a really good option for Thai in Brampton.
The Pad Thai and Panang Curry are definitely tasty choices."}
