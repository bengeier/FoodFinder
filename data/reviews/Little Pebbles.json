{"text":"Some of the best cakes in Toronto - the Match and Sesame Chiffon are perfect - light on the sugar, too! Also the strawberry roll cake is a DREAM - way better than your typical angel food cake. The space is small and cozy but so cute and the details are very instagram worthy. Also, they make a damn good cup of coffee. Definitely wanna go back."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place while strolling through Kensington Market, and got attracted to it by its cute interior and chic coffee cups that people were leaving the store with. This is a coffee/cafe run by Japanese people, and they have the highest attention to detail, from coffee to the decor and ambiance of the place! They have a fair selection of desserts to choose from (sakura and matcha tiramisu!!). Matcha latte came with the option of either sweetened/unsweetened so people who are not fond of sweets can choose the unsweetened option.

The place is super small inside, only has seatings for ~8 people, so it's more like a grab n' go place. They also do pre-orders for cakes, so it'll be a nice option if you're thinking of ordering a cake for birthday/special occasions."}
{"text":"Coffee was delicious, I had a cappuccino and it was just the way I like it: in a small ceramic cup. 

They had a few nice sweets to choose from but did not try them. 

Service was great. 

The space is small but has a nice relaxing atmosphere"}
{"text":"I got the Matcha Chiffon cake and the Chai Latte. The chiffon cake was light and fluffy with great flavor, as for the latte, it was one of the greatest chai lattes I've ever had! Definitely a staple!"}
{"text":"Very cute and small coffee shop- another rare gem in Kensington Market! They have the unique and delicious drinks and desserts available! 

I ordered the matcha chiffon cake- it was light and fluffy. The texture was moist and not overly sweet! 

Extremely good service and the staff are very patient with explaining their beverages and desserts if you have any questions. Even though the place is extremely small with only a couple of seats, the staff does not rush you to leave. 

They are always trying to expand their menus! Always looking forward to the new creations they have!

Overall, definitely recommend this place! Delicious and cute treats!"}
{"text":"It was a nice place. I tried a piece of roll cake and strawberry chiffon cake. They are very good. They costs around $5.00 and they are pretty reasonable compared to other Japanese pastries. I will definitely come back because of their price and qualities are good."}
{"text":"Similar to Neo Coffee Bar. Asian influenced western desserts + De Melho coffee. The Matcha Dacquoise is amazing. Sugar glaze on the outside, covering a pound cake, and then sandwiched between them are matcha cream and red bean. The Chiffon cake is basically an inside out roll cake. I tried their Chiffon Cake and Roll Cake. The Roll Cake trumps the other. The cream on the Chiffon Cake feels a bit dry? Maybe cause it's outside of the cake? Anyways, great coffee shop alternative in the area!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by the high quality. Ordered an espresso and a yuzu dacquoise. Espresso was smooth and rich, I've never had better. I usually don't like cookies - they tend to be too sweet. But this dacquoise was delicate and almondy, not too sweet. The buttercream wasn't too sweet either, it was smooth and tasted of butter. Perfect amount of yuzu marmalade inside with the buttercream. Espresso, dacquoise and a tiny glass of sparkling water came together on a beautiful tray. Sigh. I wish we had something like this in Boston."}
{"text":"Little Pebbles always gives me a nice warm and comforting atmosphere whenever I visit! The people working there are always friendly. It's a very small coffee shop with limited seating. So the space can be pretty tight if there's a lot of people in the shop. 

During my recent visit, I got the black lavender tea latte, sweetened. It has a very nice subtle flavor of lavender and black tea, and it was sweetened perfectly for me! It could be too sweet for others, like my friend. But be cautious, it is extremely hot!! 
I had their chiffon cakes, and they were super light and fluffy and soft. I am definitely eyeing their other desserts. 

In other words, super cute coffee shop, great drinks and desserts. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny shop selling Japanese sweets and drinks! It's a very small storefront that can only accommodate a few people at a time, so don't come with large groups.

My friend came and was really craving a coffee, so she decided to try the season special of kinako latte (roasted soybean flour latte). The latte came topped with a very generous portion of soy milk foam, making it difficult to get the taste of the kinako latte from the bottom. That said, the latte was utterly delicious! It had a rich, slightly sweet, nutty flavour. In fact, there was very little coffee flavour at all, for the kinako overpowered it all. It was a very interesting Asian spin on a latte!

Next time, I am definitely trying the black sesame latte!"}
{"text":"Little Pebbles is the place I bring every guest I get in Toronto. Why? No, it's not because it's quintessentially Toronto. It's cause it's so dang cute is why. 

It's a quaint little shop hidden away in Kensington, that you might only catch with a line creeping outside (sometimes). They recently moved space, and there's more indoor seating now which I'm eternally grateful for. The embellish each of the seating spaces with plants and paintings on an otherwise simple decor of white and wooden furniture. It's a Japanese style cafe - both in menu, environment. 

The drinks are why I came, the desserts are what keeps me coming back. They offer black sesame lattes, and matcha lattes, both sweetened and unsweetened. As an individual who does not like sweetened beverages very much, this is great! In addition, I've not personally encountered a black sesame latte before, a flavour that I think is well underused outside of Japan. They also have great coffee options, including a sakura cold brew - a floral note cold brew, not actually infused with flowers.

The desserts are incredible! I've had the Matcha tiramisu a few times, which is a Japanese take on a classic - with swaps of matcha powder instead of cocoa powder, and red paste within the layers. The sakura tiramisu is thankfully, not like other sakura items I've had before, which is usually just a hint of salty floral notes. It's incredibly unique and garnished with a swig of the flower to remind you why this place is great. Honestly,  the foodie in me is ashamed I haven't tried as many things from the menu, but the matcha tiramisu is difficult to resist when it's staring at you in a cute wooden box.

Definitely worth a try if you're in the kensington area, whether you are looking for a place for sweets, or just coffee on the go."}
{"text":"Very cute. Very sweet atmosphere. 

I got the matcha latte and enjoyed it a lot. I also got a slice of strawberry roll cake, which was good but a bit pricey and small. 

Will be here again to try their other cakes :^)"}
{"text":"This is the cutest little cafe you'll ever pass by that is a hidden gem when it comes to home brew coffee and cakes. 

I had their Black Sesame Chiffon Cake and it wad the softest, fluffiest, moistest, delicacy I've ever tasted in my entire life. The sesame flavour is not too overpowering nor is the cake too sweet. It was perfect with the recommendation from the barista that I got the matcha latte.

The matcha latte was a little plain to my tastes as I like mine more stronger and darker in flavour but I feel like the softer amount of matcha used in their latte was a perfect pairing with the cake. The slight bitterness of the matcha really brought out the savoury taste of the sesame in the cake and the sweetness of the cake brought out the nice dark aroma of matcha.

They even made a nice pretty leaf design on my matcha latte and have really cute cups and plates and cutlery! My friend got a black americano and he loved how the coffee was made to his tastes so he was happy.

I really highly recommend this place as a 1 on 1 date with a friend or SO as there are only two seats by the window so expect to grab and go if they're taken. 

They also have a cute loyalty card where you collect stamps to get you coming back for more! With how delicious their cakes are I'd love to come back and next time try more of their home brew coffee. 

Thank you for opening up!"}
{"text":"A clean looking bakery with fine little quality cakes.  I had an unsweetened matcha latte, it was great!  I also had the black chiffon cake, it was very light however black sesame flavour could be stronger.  The matcha daquoise was very good, I liked it more than the cake.  It was full of matcha flavour and there's some azuki flavour in the center as well.  It's a small bakery, with limited seating."}
{"text":"3rd time visiting. Now that they've moved a couple units down from their old location, theres much more seating space, but you need to go down some steps to reach the tables - not accessible for folks w/ mobility issues. 

The ladies that own the place are always very nice and quick with orders. I got their Iced Hibiscus Tea ($4, 1 size only). Tart like cranberry, but the cinnamon makes it spicy... cold spicy. It's one of their summer only drinks this year, and I highly recommend it. 

They have an ample amount of western and japanese fusion pastries/desserts too - however I haven't tried most of them."}
{"text":"Amazing, just amazing! It's a small bakery, but packs a punch. We ordered the matcha chiffon cake (a light cake), and Osaka style strawberry roll cake. I asked the owner...who I assume is the baker as well, what Osaka style means. She basically said it's a simplistic roll cake where there isn't any frosting or any decor on the outer layer, rather there is only a filling inside. Honestly, both cakes were winners for me, but I did prefer the roll cake (it was different from anything I have tried). They both taste, texture-wise, very moist...as if she baked/made it 5 minutes ago!  The chiffon was a perfect balance of matcha, not too bitter or strong, and not too sweet. It was just right. The strawberry roll cake was just heavenly...like holy, how do you make cakes that moist??

For me, when it comes to dessert, I don't like it super sweet or crazily rich. I sort of like the subtle taste...nothing over the top. Little Pebbles just seriously hits the spot.

Anyways, it's a really cute gem in Kensington market. Just be warned there isn't a lot of seating, so prepare to stand, get the cakes to go, or wait for an empty seat.

Really recommend this spot, I want to try the dacquoise next or the macarons. This place is superb!"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim, and very happy that I did! I ordered the matcha latte and the Sakura tiramisu. I was going to order the matcha one but they didn't have that ready when I went in.  

The latte was nice and smooth and didn't have an overly bitter taste! The tiramisu was amazing! The presentation was beautiful and the taste was good too. I was afraid that it would be too sweet but that wasn't the case. I think the jelly on top helped tame te sweetness"}
{"text":"I loved the clean, aesthetic look of Little Pebbles - I liked the light-coloured birch tables, soft lighting and the cute succulents on every table. If you choose to have your desserts and drinks in the cafe, you'll also get to enjoy the beautiful ceramic plates and mugs they serve their food in. However, seating is extremely limited - there are only 5 stools available, which makes coming in the winter time a little bit challenging since there is nowhere to hang your coat. 

I tried the cortado and the matcha roll cake. I thought that the cortado was well done, and that the matcha cake was just fine. However, I was pretty underwhelmed when I saw the size of the cake slices...they were objectively tiny, especially for the price tag ($5.25). Sure, it was tasty - the matcha filling was generous, but the cake itself was a touch dry. 

I still think that this place is worth a try - perhaps the other desserts won't be as underwhelming. However, the drinks definitely seem solid, and if anything, you will leave with a pretty instagram picture."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop - coffee was delicious and the Japanese tea cake was light as air and super tasty!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very cute place to have a nice hot drink here and hang out with friends on a chilly/rainy day. The prices are okay and would definitely go here when in the area."}
{"text":"I am ABSOLUTELY in love with this place. Everything here is so delicate in flavour, texture and appearance. The store is a semi-basement unit tucked in kensington lofts and is extremely unassuming and true to its roots. 

Pastries and desserts are hand made in store with ultimate care and the taste definetly reflects it. My favourite dessert will have to be the cherry blossom tiramisu. The top layer is delicately infuse with cherry blossom and rose water and the bottom layer of the tiramisu is creamy and light."}
{"text":"A nice place for a cup of tea and a snack. Really. Even the cups and plates are cool. What morecouldyou ask for?"}
{"text":"I would give this delicate shop a 3.5 stars rating, the roll cakes were nice & fluffy.  Why not 5 stars? Well, the cakes were good but the drinks were pretty standard, nothing special. Only a few chairs and not many room to stand around. Right across from Millie Crepe close to the parking lot where you enter to get into Kensington Market.  I would love to some Japanese inspired coffee or lattes from this place, because I feel that their cakes are good but needs some proper coffee pairing suggestions or some sort of visual inside for customers to look at while waiting."}
{"text":"After my late lunch at Seok Ar San, I was having a bad craving for dessert...cuz after spicy, its sweets ofc xD So I looked up Yelp and came across Little Pebbles at Kensington Market. 

From my first step through the door, I was in love w/ their minimalistic design. It was a small place no doubt (w/ only 3 bar tables on the side), but the open kitchen made it seem a lot more spacious. And the Birchwood theme w/ small plants added a soft touch to the place. 

In terms of food, I opted for the matcha chiffon cake; it had a sesame flavored sponge cake base w/ matcha cream on top. It was very light & springy, yet dense enough to hold its shape. It also retained its moisture and had just enough sweetness for Asian taste buds. I only wish that the flavor of the matcha cream stood out a bit more; it was too weak for me. The sesame base could use a touch more sesame as well. 

Overall though, it was a perfect treat for an afternoon tea. I'll be back to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Such a cutesy little place with cutesy desserts and delicate coffee art. Only one person working the cashier and espresso machine; I wouldn't recommend coming during rush hours especially since it's such a tiny, little space.

TRIED:
Kinako latte - which is infused with roasted sweet soy flour. I loved the nutty kinako flavor. No coffee in this but you can add a shot of espresso which I would definitely do next time.

Strawberry Daifuku Mochi - I was surprised at how much I loved it since I'm not a fan of red bean paste. The strawberry and red bean paste went well together. Wrap it up in delicious Mochi and you've got a perfect sweet treat.

Nice stop for some take out treats and coffee."}
{"text":"This cafe is so cute and stylish!! Good place to take pictures. I got the black sesame latte which was good even though I don't usually like sesame, but the barista recommended it to me so I tried it. I'm only in Toronto for vacation though, sadly, so I won't be able to try many more of their drinks TT"}
{"text":"Would give this a 3.75/5. Not quite 4 star in my books.

My boyfriend and I were strolling around Kensington this evening in search of dessert. We were standing in front of Millie's creperie when we noticed Little Pebbles across the street. We decided to check it out, and I'm glad we did!

Little Pebbles is a cute little French- and Japanese- inspired cafe. It's minimalistic on the inside and seats about 3 people or so. They serve cafe drinks and baked goods. The selection of food is narrow - they have dacquoise, macarons, Osaka-style Swiss roll cakes, and chiffon cakes.  

We opted for the Yuzu chiffon cake ($5.25). Other flavours include matcha, black sesame, and kinako adzuki. I thought it was a tad pricy for what is basically a slice of sponge cake with cream on it, but it was decent. The cream on the outside was not too thick or sweet, but got a very little bit... dry? less creamy? due to the refrigeration, I suppose. The cake was very light, spongy, moist, and had little pieces of yuzu peel distributed throughout. It gave a pronounced -but not overwhelming - citrus flavour against a backdrop of not-too-sweet vanilla cake.

The girl who served us was very sweet. I wouldn't mind going back again to try some of their other baked goods, or perhaps a latte."}
{"text":"Their black sesame chiffon cake is amazingly delicious. Went in today for my first visit for their chiffon cake around 1pm but they had none ready at the time and I was told that the next batch will be ready in about an hour. I went back at 2 and they were still decorating the cake. I had to wait for another 10 mins or so to pick up my order. The staff was friendly and the store was decorated cozy and cute. I had the cake in the evening and it tasted sooooo delicious  it's so light, fluffy, and not too sweet. Everything balanced perfectly together. I would definitely go back and try other flavour."}
{"text":"Small Japanese cafe with delectible treats and great coffee.  Tried the yuzu cake and it was moist, light and the perfect amount of sweetness.  Tried their dacquoise which was similar to a macaroon but a little chewier.  All in all, a nice little space in Kensington to stop for a warm drink and treat."}
{"text":"An instagrammer's dream! The cutest little shop with the prettiest little chiffon cakes wrapped up in tiny little boxes and eaten with tiny little wooden spoons. So so so refreshingly light, scrumptious, little cakes that will have you hopping back for more. Skip the panna cotta, they are not-so-great. Friendly staff, minimal seating, it's more of a grab and go kinda shop. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Japanese everything. There is crazy attention to detail and this store is no exception. Beautiful, clean, strong AC. The desserts themselves are beautifully presented. I got the Sakura tiramisu. Expensive at $7 but so worth it. Delicious Sakura infused jelly with Sakura blossoms on top. Divine."}
{"text":"The iced latte is really good! It's a small charming place. They have delicious-looking desserts too!"}
{"text":"Came across this cute little cafe while roaming around Kensington market. It's very small and limited seats I think there's only 8 seats max so it's definitely not a dine in place. Ordered their matcha slice to go since a couple ppl took up he whole place leaving their jackets on empty seats. There's only one person working so even if there was just one person ahead of you the wait was 10 mins. Nothing special about the cake. Taste was okay but not worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! It's really close to Millie Creperie, and I almost walked right by it until I saw the beautiful white sign. The interior is decorated so prettily, and I overheard that it was the barista's husband who designed the decor. So cute!

The staff is purely Japanese, but they speak English pretty well. Their desserts use ingredients from Japan, and it's supposed to be Osaka-style cakes. We ordered chiffon cakes and coffee, which came quite quickly. The barista also pulled out a container of cream for me from the fridge.

The desserts are certainly light and fluffy. For such a small cafe, their business is doing quite well- a few customers came and went while we were dining inside. I only docked a star off because the café only fits 3 customers at a time, and I feel like it would be perfect as a studying location if it was only roomier!

I would come back! 

Favorites: matcha chiffon cake"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe on Baldwin and has little pastries and desserts from Japan. Enjoyed their little cozy atmosphere. I had the Black Sesame Latte and Matcha Tiramisu from Little Pebbles and enjoyed them. However, I think the Latte could have tasted better though if the milk was steamed to a higher temperature as I found it wasn't hot enough."}
{"text":"This cute little cafe is very minimalist and has cute decor. It has some little dessert items like cakes as well as a variety of coffee drinks. They have very limited seating inside consisting of only around 5 bar stools, but they also have a bench outside that they reserve for their customers only. I came here while a new employee was getting trained so it was kind of interesting listening to her share knowledge about the different roasts they have in the store. The friendly staff here was definitely a pro of this cafe.

I saw the black sesame chiffon cake was very popular here so I decided I had to try it. The high price tag of 5.25 for the tiny little slice however was a big disappointment. It was at most worth 3 dollars. Furthermore, the cake was quite dry and tasted as if it's been sitting around for a while. I wish it would have been fresh because it probably would've tasted much better. Hopefully the other items on the menu are better!"}
{"text":"Love their fruit/red bean mochi!! It was riduculously good; I'm just sad they didn't have any raspberry ones when I got there. Decent lattes too."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and great service. Good variety of Japanese desserts and they are so delicious! Really small space, so would encourage to buy things to-go."}
{"text":"An extremely tiny, simple/clean and cute French inspired Japanese coffee shop. There's only seating for 5 people and so this shop is better for grab and go coffee. I tried their matcha latte (sweetened option) and loved it! It was a bit sweeter than what I'd prefer so next time I'll opt for the unsweetened version and add my own sugar. But the latte was extremely smooth and well made. Many places serve matcha latte that tastes more milky than matcha-y and leave your mouth feeling powdery but this place did great! The matcha taste and milk blended so well together and tasted \"as one\"..hard to describe. The matcha chiffon cake was also deliciously fluffy and light. I didn't find the Sakura macaron too special, perhaps because I was expecting a much stronger or unique taste. 
I wish I could rate Little Pebbles 5 stars but before doing so, I need to visit a couple more times and try other items on their menu to get a fuller picture. But overall, this little coffee shop deserves a 4 for my first visit!"}
{"text":"This little coffee shop in Kensington Market is reminiscent of pleasant little places in Japan. The black sesame latte is delicious and the desserts are like tasty treats in Japan. There is limited seating but it's well worth a visit even if your order has to be to go. Staff is friendly and it's a nice finale after dinner on Spadina or in the market."}
{"text":"The house blend is very good! Perfect medium roast. My friend had an americano and really enjoyed it. The staff is friendly and the place is very clean. It's sort of tucked away from the action of Kensington but worth the search! Only a few seats inside so don't come here to sit and chat - more of a pick up and go place."}
{"text":"I gave this café another try, and the cake tasted a lot better than before! 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
The lovely lady at the front counter was very friendly, upbeat, and helpful.

[FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5
High-quality ingredients were mixed together to create a perfectly airy, moist, and subtly sweet cake! 

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Black Sesame Chiffon Cake: this was amazing! The cake tasted like a cloud, and the nutty black sesame flavour went very well with the earthy matcha frosting. The sweetness was a too subtle for my liking, but I know they used high-quality sugar that was slightly less sweet than regular white sugar, so I know I ate the good stuff! 

- Black Sesame Latte: choice of sweetened or unsweetened. I chose the  \"sweetened\" option and it had the perfect amount of sweetness to complement the cake. The texture was silky smooth and very enjoyable. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
The cake was definitely a lot better this time because they changed the recipe to the Black Sesame Chiffon cake so it didn't dry out too quickly. I really appreciated how Little Pebbles continually developed their business as they experimented with different methods and improved their recipes. After my second visit, I would highly recommend this place for those who enjoy high-quality Japanese desserts."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in Kensington Market. Its small with 5 highstool seats (2 facing the window and 3 facing the wall). The girl was nice and friendly. I got the matcha chiffon cake and it wasnt hard as what other yelpers mentioned. Pretty pricy was the cake, it was good but pretty tiny for the price $5.50. Cortado was made well for $3.50."}
{"text":"4.5 stars... with each visit, this place just gets better.  It helps they just moved west on the same street to a much bigger space.

Little Pebbles is a bit of anomaly in Kensington.  There are no hipsters, loud music, or grittiness that the area is known for.  Stepping inside the small bakery resembles a bit of the serenity of small store in Japan.  Clean white walls and thoughtful cute accents are it's only decorations is a minimalist zen atmosphere.  The seating area is further down which is a nice relief compared to the cramped quarters of the previous spot.  There are no true tables here... just small shelves that allow you to sit as you enjoy your amazing drinks and food.  They do have a communal table finally.  I love how they restrict the use of laptops to only weekdays mostly.  Nothing is more frustrating than to find a spot when a bunch of laptops are taking up 2 seats.

I find the staff here really great.  When you first enter, you're warmly and politely greeted by the staff... there's usually 2 of them.  On weekends, I do see 3 people now.  You're given the opportunity to drool over the desserts in the case.  They have a lot of seasonal items and YES, the matcha tiramisu is great but if they have the strawberry or cherry blossom items... grab them!  They are very good on offering explanations so if you're not sure of something... just ask!  I had to ask a bit about their drink menu and they took the time to explain.

I highly recommend you try their drinks here.  They use De Mello beans which is a local Toronto coffee roaster... it's definitely more on the bitter and adventurous side but its a good one.  I really love the black sesame and kinako lattes here. Quite unique and if you love roasted nutty notes... these are so soooo good.  They do offer it without a syrup if you're wanting more of the authentic nutty note.

As for the baked goods... they're all good.  I've had the mochi and it's wonderfully smooth and with the right QQ texture.  Tender and soft but still bouncy.  They also offer cakes like swiss rolls... unlike other places, the swiss roll is a perfect swirl and the cake is still tender.  One thing I love about the Japanese influenced baking, it's always just the right minimal amount of sugar.  It's really about letting the natural flavours show through before any sugar is added.

Kinako Latte - Kinako is roasted soy bean ... now I know most people would be 'eh' but this note is so wonderful and clean.  Though it veers towards the nutty... it's a light note and in a latte, it just makes the drink very creamy.  It just had a richer taste than your normal matcha latte.  Between the Black Sesame and the Kinako, it's so hard to choose a favourite.  There's so much care when they make this drink. I saw the barista gently use a whisk of the kinako and a bit of the hot milk to make the paste be smooth and creamy before doing the rest of the pour.  5/5

Matcha Tiramisu - This is one of their showcase desserts... well I think so just cause their presentation is so unique.  The tiramisu is layered in a wooden box with the vivid green of the matcha powder dusting the really silky custard.  When you dip your spoon, you immediately scoop up the lightest cream filling you've probably seen.  Lightly sweet from the white chocolate, this light cream is almost cloud like and then you notice the natural sweetness in the end.  The matcha powder on top gives you that strong burst of flavour that keeps this out of the boring territory.  It can be a bit bitter... but when you take a big scoop of the creamy interior, it's not so bitter.  On the bottom somewhere is a cookie that has been soaking up the flavours.  All together, it's easy to eat one just by yourself.  I may have argued for the last few bites.  5/5

Flat White - Still think these are good but I'm not sure Im a fan of these beans.  They're a bit more bitter than what I like but I've been finding that as a De Mello feature instead of a Little Pebble.  4/5

My previous review had the Black Sesame latte at a 5/5 and I highly recommend it if you love nutty flavours.  I think the can even do it iced but honestly... it's so good as a latte.  Hopefully you'll come in a small group so you can try all the various little desserts.  They're so unique and worth the stop."}
{"text":"Stopped by this cute little café after lunch. It's tiny and only has 2 rows of bar tables, but the décor is nice. Decided to give this place a try instead of Millie's Creperie as it seemed like this place had more authentic and unique Japanese desserts. 

Black Sesame Chiffon Cake ($5.25)
The chiffon cakes are one of their specialties here. This tasted like a fluffy sponge cake, the cake texture was moist. I thought the black sesame flavor was light, but it went really well with the outer icing cream.

Matcha Dacquoise ($3.75)
When I asked the staff what this was, she said it was like a Japanese style cookie. But turns out the texture is nothing compared to a cookie cause it wasn't crunchy at all. It's more like 2 soft biscuits sandwiching some matcha cream in the middle.
Pricing is slightly steep for just one piece.

Loved the bowl/cup of the matcha latte! It was $3.75 for a regular size I believe. It was flavorful, not too sweet and not powdery at all. Perfect cake pairing!"}
{"text":"Cutest little coffee shop on Baldwin street.  The staff is so super nice and they have something that I love... matcha!


Had the matcha latte and a matcha dacquoise which is a bigger version of a macaron.  

Both were yummy and I like how the latte is in a big Japanese tea cup.  I would definitely come back for more matcha madness. Lol"}
{"text":"Super cute and small minimalistic 'cafe' in Kensington market. We actually went to the neighbouring store (Kiss the Tiramisu) first but saw that this place looked interested and decided to get something from here to try out. We got the Sakura Tiramisu and it was definitely something really unique. Ive never tried anything like this before. The cake itself was tiny and more on the pricier side.

It smelt really nice.. literally like Japanese blossoms. You can eat the leaves and the gold flakes that's in the pink clear jelly part. You can probably eat the stem too but we avoided that. My friends reaction was hilarious when she tried the cake - \"it tastes like my face mask!\" LOL. She's right! Weird at first but it still tasted good! The Tiramisu and cake part was at the right consistency and it tasted good together. The leaf tasted like lychee which was interesting as well. 

Little steep on the price but the quality and taste of the cake was delicious I would probably come back again to try something else! Next on my list is their mochi :)"}
{"text":"tldr: Coffee shop/bakery you'd find in the hipster districts of Tokyo. High quality ingredients, people, and final products.

Little Pebbles is a Japanese-run cafe. The offers are made from a eclectic array of Japanese ingredients including matcha, black seasame, and kinako. There are always special items on the menu. If you can get the daifuku mochi (with real fruit inside with azuki bean), get it. The kinako latte with almond milk is amazingly different. Must-go."}
{"text":"Ordered a peach mochi. I was surprised by the actual peach chunks inside mixed with a sweet red bean paste. It was good, sweet but not too sweet."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in Kensington market. I give them 2.5/5x We got the Iced Kinako Latte which taste like soy latte to me but with a slight nutty texture. You can choose to get it sweetened or unsweetened. We got ours sweetened and it was just right, not very sweet. It was enjoyable however the espresso taste was lacking as didn't have much coffee taste to it at all. It was also quite pricey at almost 6$ for a small iced latte."}
