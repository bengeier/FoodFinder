{"text":"So amazing! I'm Native American and this reminds me so much of Home! I love this! The green shredded beef burrito is the best!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great selection of huge burritos! (Or was it a huge selection of great burritos?) The tortillas were thick and fluffy...so much better than regular tortillas.   We got the green shredded beef burrito with beans and cheese and it was super tasty! We also got the red shredded beef burrito with beans. It was pretty spicy but delicious. The potatoes were a nice addition too."}
{"text":"I ask for a red and green chili burrito but it comes with beans, beans on the side please, NO im told we dont do sides. So they charge me full price for a burrito with No beans and refuse to discount the removal of the beans and refuse to give me what I paid for. $7 for a half pound of chips and a burrito. First and last time coming here"}
{"text":"Virtually tasteless. I've been eating Mexican food for longer than I can remember, and this food was without any spice flavor Etc. Plus the texture was just mushy, pasty. I had three Barbacoa street tacos.  Service was lackluster, dining room was loud because of the blaring television, we were given a giant thimble to put our water in, and there was a $0.50 charge to use a credit card.  Nice selection of salsas and toppings to put on the food at their salsa bar.  Very underwhelmed, will go back to Super Oscars in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"New favorite spot for good quality burritos! Food was fast and great tasting! Will be back for sure.   Tried the green shredded burrito with beans ans cheese! A-1"}
{"text":"Omg this place is awesome!!! The tortillas are fresh and they have a large variety of fillings for your burritos!!!!"}
{"text":"I spent $10 and 20 minutes on a burrito and soda.  It should have cost $5 and taken 5 minutes.  If authentic means over priced and a really long wait time, with small taco sized burritos, then this place is for you... not me.  They cook one order at a time.  The don't start the next order until the current order is complete. Very inefficient way to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is the burrito antidote to Chipotle and the Mission-style burrito as a whole.  Super legit burritos from the Mexican state of Sonora. Lots of choices (lengua in green chile, various meats, etc) wrapped in what appear to be freshly-made flour tortillas.  They don't stuff them full of rice, beans, guacamole, lettuce, sour cream, etc, because a) that's not how burritos are made in Sonora or the rest of Mexico, and b) they don't need to.   This is a really great place. Please go here and discover Mexico-Mexican food."}
