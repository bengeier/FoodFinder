{"text":"Prices are good! Never in a million years thought gluten free treats would be this good."}
{"text":"The cheesecake was YUMMY!!! Had a tsoynami with cherry pie filling, vanilla wafers and vanilla ice cream very good."}
{"text":"The tsoynami was okay, but brunch was definitely sub par especially for $10... I had high expectations because of all of the positive reviews but felt underwhelmed and disappointed"}
{"text":"Incredible. Discovered this place by word of social media, and did not regret it one bit!  I had the \"Betterfinger\" tsoyonami, and my boyfriend had a raspberry mocha. The tsoyonomi was delicious - after not having ice cream or anything that resembles it for a year, it was liquid gold to my palette. I also sampled his raspberry mocha, which was just as delightful. It had a rich mocha flavor with just the right amount of sweet raspberry to where it was distinct but not overpowering. The staff was also very helpful, and they seemed to have a great camaraderie behind the bar, which is always a good sign. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Nami!  I am not a vegan but EASILY could be with treats like the ones served there.  

The Oatmeal Cream Pie (OCP), chocolate chip cookie, peanut butter and chocolate candy bar, soynamis, etc., etc., etc.  Everything is delicious!  

The coffee is also awesome.  In fact, it is so good that I've gone in just for an Americano (and somehow managed to not get a sweet to go with it).  

The staff is super-friendly, too.  They are always smiling and pleasant."}
{"text":"Nami is the perfect all vegan place for a treat during the crazy AZ summers! Their tsoynamis never disappoint and with so many options for mix ins, you can try something new every time you go! The chocolate soft serve is my favorite (they also have vanilla or swirl) and their ricemellow fluff is the yummiest mix in! I also absolutely love their vegan donuts and am so happy that they always have at least one gluten free option to choose from. The only thing that I'm not a huge fan of is the coffee which is very acidic and has an odd aftertaste."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito ever! I can't wait to come back to Phoenix so I can eat here again. I don't even like soy cheese but the country breakfast burrito rocked my world.. I would have loved to eat it with a fork and knife on a plate, but even in its basket the taste was amazing and I know I'll be craving it until my next Arizona adventure. Service was super friendly, my latte with hazelnut milk was on point, and the garlicky salsa that came with the burrito was pure magic. 

They only serve breakfast, and the menu isn't up on the board as that is full of all the bakery treats and beverages. I'd love to see a larger menu, or even some menus by the door for more accessibility. Luckily I knew about the food from yelp, so I just asked the people in front of me to pass a menu back. It's a little awkward to not be able to see a menu until it's your turn to order if others are in line behind you. Overall, great job Nami! You've got to taste it to believe it."}
{"text":"Excellent alternative to froyo and the normal packed coffee house in the neighborhood. Nice atmosphere. Easy place to work on papers or meet with friends. Good coffee, good sweets, and good frozen treats. Try a tsoynami with some frozen fruit and be open to trying some vegan quiches. Parking is scarce, so be sure to carpool. Get your hipster fix in an unpretentious way."}
{"text":"I've have used Yelp several times to find great places to eat, but unfortunately my first review is going to have to be negative :(  I visited Nami with a friend the other night and had a pretty bad experience. Basically, the prices were not truthfully stated, the customer service was selective/awful depending on who you are and what you ask, and they seem to be lacking in their regard for those with food allergies.

The long version:
It's a cute place and seemed busy with a mostly young, artistic crowd hanging out. After staring at the main menu for a minute trying to figure out where the ice cream was, an employee handed us a separate menu to see the ice cream selection. My friend ordered first, and then I ordered. Everything seemed normal and fine up to this point, but when the cashier told me the price was $5.50 as opposed to the $4.50 listed on the menu, I was a little taken aback ( I hadn't added any toppings) and politely asked why the price jump. 

She suddenly became very short with me, almost angry, started handling everything roughly while telling me that there was tax and also that chocolate always cost more (which wasn't previously stated anywhere that I could find). I felt intimidated by her and wanted ice cream, so I said it wasn't a problem and paid. My friend was perplexed at what had just happened and was more angry about the situation than I was at the moment, but I started feeling more annoyed when I turned around to see the same cashier helping the guy behind me and being sweet and flirty with him. Clearly it wasn't just a bad mood that I had accidentally been met with. 

When I got my dessert, they called the wrong name (the cashier had never bothered to ask). I was getting sick of everything and thought it would be nice to sit outside, but we had barely taken our seats when a random guy off the street who didn't appear to be a paying customer took the table next to us and proceeded to ask if we minded if he smoked. My friend misheard the question and said it was fine, so he lit up. I realize we were downtown and you can only control your patios so much, but I was over it and motioned for us to leave. 

Finally, I quickly noticed I was having a mild allergic reaction. I am moderately allergic to peanuts (more akin to food poisoning than anaphylactic shock), and this was the sensation I get when I've eaten a small amount. I had worried earlier that the mixing bowls might not be cleaned adequately between batches, and it seemed my fears were realized. Both my friend and I decided we won't be visiting there again."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix from L.A. for a concert and after having dinner at Green, we woke up the next day and came to Nami for breakfast before heading home. Vegan doughnuts! Vegan egg mcmuffin! So so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Had a Banana Cream Pie tSoynami and it was delicious, and grabbed a Vegan Victory Bar and even though it had a dark green color to it, it was still great to top off my Calexico Burger from Green next door...I'm def coming here more often"}
{"text":"Yummy! Everything is so good!! My fav is the Betterfinger Tsoynami!!"}
{"text":"It's definitely a treat.  I got to split one with a friend after eating at Green and it was excellent.  A nice alternative for avoiding dairy.

Not sure of the flavor, but pretty sure it had bananas and cookies.  One is more than enough to share with multiple people especially after a meal.

Another great place in the central corridor"}
{"text":"My best friend and I would get deserts here all the time in Phoenix.  This is hands down one of the best places to go get ice-cream when the hot Phoenix summers are weighing down on you. The staff is friendly and super amazing at helping you find the perfect eats."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I wish I heard of it sooner. Perfect place to satisfy a sweet tooth while staying healthy! Only reason I gave 4stars is because they were out of doughnuts which I am eager to go back and try"}
{"text":"I take back my previous review. Over time I have tried different options at Nami and it has become a favorite place for me. You get quite a bit of soy ice cream for your money - usually more than I can eat in one sitting and they now have chocolate soy ice cream as well. My favorites are the Dough Boy and Almond Oy Vey! I love that all of the things on their menu are vegan, and my husband who is not a vegan, thinks their cookie dough cupcake is the best cupcake in the world! For my husband to think that highly of a dessert is an incredible complement because let me tell you, he has the biggest sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"I am here at least once a week and I love the \"no's n mint\" tsoymami. The location it cute with great decor. Parking can be tough depending on the day of the week so be prepared to go to plan B. the proves can seem high for ice cream but once you get the ice cream you'll understand.  portions are huge."}
{"text":"Came here to meet my tutor for some late night studying + ice cream. The ice cream was awesome and they had a ton of things to mix in - delicious! Someone nearby got some curry thing that smelled amazing - really interested in trying some of the food and tofu selections. Looks good! I'd definitely be back sooner if I didn't live so far."}
{"text":"The tSoynamis are wonderful. They are expensive, but is a nice once-in-a-while treat.

My only suggestion to the manager: Please place PRICES on your pastries and sweets displayed in the glass case. (ie. doughnuts, muffins, cake, etc). I'm not in favor of unpriced items.

It is a slight inconvenience for me to have to ask your staff member what the prices are on each item-I don't want to hold up the line. I want to do the math and make my selections BEFORE approaching the register. I think others would feel the same way.

Pricing each item (sweets in the window) gives courtesy to your customers and holds the business accountable for accuracy in numbers. This ensures that the customer knows exactly how much he/she is being charged for tax."}
{"text":"Vegan paradise!  
We need more places like Nami in the midwest.  Drived through 7th Ave and was pleasantly suprised by this little joint.  Service was friendly and prompt, and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I came here one day with my cousin. Her son can't have any Dairy and always requests Ice cream from here. So I decided to tag along.. I mean I have sensitivity to dairy myself so why not. I ordered the Almond Oy Vey! And Oy Vey was it good! I definitely will be back again... And again and again! Nami you gained a new non dairy follower"}
{"text":"Best vegan desserts in Arizona . PERIOD !!! From their soy based frozen concoctions called tsoynamis to their vegan pastries, breakfast and coffees! 

They make vanilla, chocolate or a swirl of both. My go to ones are chunkey monkey and peanut butter and banana. But wanted to try something different so tonight we tried the pumpkin pie tsoynami and hubby got the banana cream pie tsoynami ( he always get that one but I would prefer it with peanut butter and chocolate) and OMG the pumpkin pie tsoynami is AMAZING..... The pumpkin puree is so good , you can actually taste it....it definitely isnt covered up by all the spices.....just pure pumpkin with vanilla and Graham crackers. YUM.....

Again friendly staff, small seating area but always fortunate to find seating every single time we are here (thank you universe). They too have outdoor seating but their parking can be a bit of a pain. 

Go get dinner before hand next door and come here for dessert! You will not regret it....after all peace begins on our plate !"}
{"text":"I'm visiting phoenix and have been here twice in the last 24 hours. I initially thought it was closed when i came and it looked pitch black, but it was the building next door that was packed with a line out the door at 830pm. It's delicious and all vegan. I'm told the cactus haboob was the best latte my friend has ever had. The brunch was yummy and so was the tsoynami. I'll be back next time I'm in town. I can't wait to try the rodney dangerfield and have another tsoynami!"}
{"text":"Was recommended to try this place out per my new yelp friend Christine. Came here for brunch and have to admit that their Carmel latte w/almond milk is by far better than Starbucks! We couldn't leave without getting their famous tSoynami (clunky monkey), can't believe it was dairy free...YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Just had their Gluten Free raspberry donut and again I am so impressed. Before eating gf donuts were my go to feel good food. I have tried assorted bakery and boxed types to no avail. This donut was moist, not dry or gritty like others. The flavor was exceptional and the frosting on top made it the absolute best GF Donut I have had to date."}
{"text":"This place is so cozy and the vegan/gluten free food is amazing. You can't go wrong with the treats they serve here"}
{"text":"There was more foam (an inch deep) then coffee in my small cactus haboob. The Nami Mcbagel sandwich was alright, all I could taste is the spicy part of the salsa. Honestly I was very disappointed with the service as well, they forgot my friends plain bagel... It was the first thing we order. The fruit was delicious though!"}
{"text":"OMG, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough tSoynami is like crack to me! My favorite ice cream before going vegan was Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough so I was psyched when I saw this here. I was not disappointed! No, it's not as creamy as \"real\" ice cream, but it beyond hit the spot for me. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! 

I did order some other desserts. I'm sure they were okay, but nothing could hold a candle to that cookie dough. I think it put me in a heavenly dessert blackout. I believe we also ordered Lavender Tea cookies, White Chocolate Raspberry cupcake, and Vanilla and Chocolate milkshakes. Don't judge! 

As everyone has mentioned, the parking is a nightmare. I went at an off time to minimize the trauma as I drive a CUV. My passenger had to get out and guide me into a space. It was sooo worth it. I would do it again!"}
{"text":"Popped in here while I waited for my food at Green to be served. Ordered a latte and waited to be called. Two girls behind the counter service coffee and ice cream constantly touched their hair and faces while leisurely serving up their customers requests. I guess when you serve such pristine vegan confections without all the icky yucky animal products, face and hair germs arent a factor. When it's vegan your already doing a good thing, amiright? Good latte nonetheless."}
{"text":"We are so glad we found this place! Great sushi and delicious miso soup. They have some great menu options as well!"}
{"text":"Vegan breakfast  includes donuts, acai bowls and some salads. The food was not the best tasting or texture. My friend got an acai bowl that was huge and soupy. The donut was okay, the salad was a little rich for a breakfast item and a big portion. Not my favorite place."}
{"text":"This place was busy.... Good sign usually.  The food wasn't extraordinary to me; but it was nevertheless very good, fresh, healthy, and the staff was nice and place is clean. So it's definitely worth coming back"}
{"text":"Good food and thoroughly enjoy their brunch, but they need to figure out a system for to go orders. I am standing in a very long line waiting to pay even though I called the order in. What a waste of my time! Figure it out guys. And yes, I even asked one of the employees and was told I had to wait..."}
{"text":"Love Nami, we go almost every Sunday for brunch. Such a great idea they separated Green from Nami. The sage sausage scramble is definitely a must-try. Great atmosphere and people"}
{"text":"They have the best vegan desserts I have ever had! Staff is friendly and efficient. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I always stop in during the week we love the breakfast and the  namis! the dough boy is bomb...  it's my all time favorite....we love samantha! She has the best attitude there  and knows what we usually order."}
{"text":"I love Nami! I love their breakfast, I love their desserts, I love their coffee! 
The only thing that could make Nami better is if they had a location closer to my house. Even if that never happens Ill still make the drive :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The acai and Pitaya bowls are super tasty. They have great coffee and the perfect thing to pair with good coffee are their amazing vegan doughnuts. I haven't tried anything on the menu that I didn't like. So excited to have this Vegan jewel in my hood. Everyone that works here is friendly and fun!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is awesome. Good coffee good baked treats, and their tsoynami frozen desserts are amazing. The betterfinger is delicious and what my dreams are made of. Plus everyone who works here is really nice and also super babes."}
{"text":"BE STILL MY BLIZZARD LOVING HEART. I've never found a vegan soft serve joint that makes blizzard like treats for the dairy free folks. I must return for their donuts."}
{"text":"If you are vegan, gluten free or both, this is your place for desserts. Due to health problems, I also get left out of desserts after dinner with my friends. At Nami, we can all enjoy a dessert including myself. The brunch is also delicious especially on Sundays!"}
{"text":"This place has the best vegan treats I have tried. The ice cream is delicious, not too sweet but not too bland. The cookies taste almost like regular dairy cookies, same with the cheesecake. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Prices are fair. If you're ever in the area and craving something sweet you should give this place a try!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get coffee, besides Seattle Espresso in Chandler.  The best thing about this place is everything is Vegan and tasty.  Even people that aren't vegan love this place.  The people that work here are awesome and friendly.  Try their biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"I never knew Vegan sweets could taste so good. The tSoynamis are amazing particularly the classic peanut butter and chocolate flavor combination.  These tSoynamis are similar to a blizzard in the sense that it is a soft serve type ice cream with mix ins...that's when comparisons end though.  The ice cream here is vegan although the texture isn't quite as soft as traditional soft serve it's still pretty smooth on the whole.

The baked goods are also quite delicious and quite massive.

The prices are a little on the high side though and would add up quickly if one came here all the time for a coffee or dessert. Still need to try the brunch."}
{"text":"This place is so neat with an amazing selection. I ordered their Soy Captain tsoynami which is vanilla \"ice cream\", strawberries and vegan captain crunch. It was delicious and a great treat for a hot day! The staff is also very friendly and personable. I will be definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Everyone is no nice and accommodating. The food is very fresh and very tasty. I highly recommend it!! They are great with large groups too!"}
{"text":"Finally went here with hubby and it did not disappoint. Split the Mash tsoynami and the pecan gluten free doughnut with him. Both delish!! Another thing I love is how it is next door to The Green restaurant. Walked right over and had a lunch. Wrote a review for them too!!"}
{"text":"The service was quick and kind. The food good but I'm no vegetarian or vegan so I've had much creamier ice cream but I'm sure it's very enjoyable for anyone that is not able to consume traditional dairy desserts."}
{"text":"Their peanut butter and chocolate tSoynami was good but not great.  I'm not vegan, and I prefer dairy ice cream, but I've had vegan ice cream I liked better than this (especially coconut milk ice cream).  Also, the chocolate reminded me of Hershey's syrup."}
{"text":"OMG is what you will say when you taste their yummy nami!! Phenomenal and amazing!! I've had it all at this place, my favorite go to for large portions and variety of flavors"}
{"text":"I am so excited about this!
I have a dairy allergy and am pretty use to coffee shops using the cheapest soy milk they can find to pacify us non-dairy people, and then typically charge an extra $.50 for it. 

Nami is all vegan.  I was pleasantly surprised when I went there and asked for a  latte and they asked me, \"would you like that made with soy, hazelnut, almond, or coconut milk?\"  WHAT!?! choices?  They also informed me that once they get more settled they want to start making fresh nut milks.  
The hazelnut latte is awesome.  Also, the \"Nami Cakes\" are soooo good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ice cream place in town. If you are turned off by the whole \"vegan thing\" don't be! They make better ice cream then the cold stone creamery. I had the banana cream pie toysomi with vanilla ice-cream and it was amazing! I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. You can't pick a bad item to get. Everyone who works to serve up delicious treats there is awesome. My favorite is going on Sunday's when brunch is available, but any day with a Nami visit is a good day!"}
{"text":"It's taking 30 minutes to get a small soft serve ice cream! Nothing special, no fancy order, just straight out of the machine! 30 FRIGGING MINUTES!!! Still waiting!!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of options, which is great, but they hand mix everything, so the top of my friend's tsoynami tasted like syrup. I had the German chocolate cake tsoynami and the s'more. Both were awesome, but I think the s'more an out."}
{"text":"Here is the deal with Nami. I like you, I do but you just aren't friendly.  I have been in there multiple times and I would love to buy multiple things but I feel like I am bothering all of you. 

Tonight I asked a question about ice cream.  I wanted enough to take home for me and my roommate to share AND have some for the weekend.  But you never let me get there and I ended up with a cup full of ice cream for just him.

My advice would be take the time to find out what someone wants completely before checking out of the conversation.  And don't look complete pissed when I ask you what something is. It makes me feel like I am bothering you and it makes you look like a jerk.

I will say if there was another place to go that had everything you did I would never go to you again until you changed your wicked ways."}
{"text":"I got a little confused because their sign is by a building the same color and on the door of the building it says Nami is next door. Other than that, I really liked the chocolate shake I got. It was very refreshing and not too sweet. A bit of an icey texture, which I liked. There were plenty of drinks I would like to try next, maybe the prickly pear tea or a steamer ( I don't drink coffee). The place was small, but comfortable with a good amount of seating. Lots of young people here. The parking lot was pretty small. Prices are a little above average. I wish the cashier would have bothered to tell me specials and whatnot because I was a bit at a loss of what to order."}
{"text":"A family favorite. Will continue to go back. The staff is always very generous and helpful. The food is fantastic. You would never know this is a vegan restaurant. I bring non-veg family here all the time and they always enjoy it and ask to meet there again. Absolutely lovely!"}
{"text":"It was our last day in Phoenix and we were looking for someplace near ASU to get breakfast. This was fairly close so we stopped.The staff was friendly but the food at this restaurant was very strange. We ordered (what we thought were) egg plates but were apparently some type of tofu scramble. The food was fairly tasty, but overpriced for something that didn't even have meat in it. My daughter ordered a coffee that cost $5.25(!) which was so bad it was undrinkable. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I love their Sunday brunch. The burritos are super filling and just very yummy. I have a lot of food allergies and it's hard for me to find a place where I can really enjoy the food without suffering from it. This place just does that. Save some room for tsoynami or a donut!"}
{"text":"I live in Portland but my family is in Phoenix, so I visit often. I absolutely love this place! It feels like I found a little bit of Portland there. The staff is super attentive and the food is so delicious. I love showing off how yummy vegan food can be to my family!"}
{"text":"This place was so so so so great! We ate here for breakfast and also for dessert one night.
For breakfast hubby loved the biscuits and gravy and I LOVED the chilaquiles!!! So so great!
For dessert, we enjoyed the wonderful, amazing tsoynamis, which were indescribably delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, I didnt perticularly feel it was the best sushi in town but not bad. Waiters are gentle, the atmosphere seems nice and feels fresh."}
{"text":"Great coffee, delicious food and a wide variety to choose from at this sunny, cheery cafe. I'd definitely bring friends back here. The vegan breakfast menu includes pastries, bagels, biscuits and gravy, some breakfast burritos, yogurt parfait, pitaya purée with granola... I had a great kale salad with a citrusy chia seed dressing for breakfast. They also make specialty espresso drinks like the kick start (mocha with cayenne). Everyone was friendly, making it a nice overall experience."}
{"text":"Tsoynami! Oh Em Gee, delicious. 

Really good brunch on Sundays, with interesting and tasty specials (sweet cauliflower breakfast curry, what?!).

Pretty attentive and pleasant staff (lack of comma ambiguity).  

Can get crowded and loud indoors during peak brunch hours, but there's a significant amount of outdoor seating if the noise is bothersome. 

Also, multiple sriracha sightings. 

Sleep well knowing that although those doughnuts and tsoynami aren't helping your waistline, they also aren't directly supporting an industry of cruelty."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I came in on a bad day, but we had horrible customer service from everyone who helped us except for the wonderfully kind guy on register this morning. I'm a vegan who lives in the area and was really excited to finally try this place, and I'm pretty disappointed that I didn't get the same cheerful service so many glowing reviews have mentioned. Having never been there before, we didn't know exactly how the service works, so when we'd received our entire order (including my coffee) but not my boyfriend's drink, we waited 5 minutes and then politely mentioned to a server that we were missing it. She literally said \"okay?\" (note the question mark) as she rolled her eyes and then never came back. My boyfriend and I just sort of stared at each other awestruck by how rude she was to us, and worst of all I think she may have been an owner or in management. As far as the food went, everything was really good! The biscuits and gravy were our mutual favorite, and everything came out of the kitchen so quickly that it made up for the 15 minutes we waited in line to order. I'm a coffee freak, and their cold brew was perfect. I wanted a to-go box for my donut and was too scared to ask for fear of being snapped at again by someone who clearly feels it isn't their job to help.. Overall, I do recommend this place to vegans and carnists alike, but with caution; expect yummy food but don't expect to be greeted when you walk in and don't expect to see any smiles."}
{"text":"Super fantastic vegan deserts and coffee! Handmade ice cream!  Donuts! Cupcakes!  Wow, so awesome!!!  Really a great place. And if you want food, go next door to Greens (restaurant owned by same people). Thank you so much for making my tummy happy :o)"}
{"text":"Happened to be way up in Phoenix proper today and wanted to take advantage of some vegan grub. I selected this place at random and am so happy that I did. 

Great service. Pleasant atmosphere - on the student/hippy-ish/granola side of things - but that appeals to me. 

Had a great order of vegan biscuits and gravy that reminded me of home (in the South), just a whole lot more vegan!  Yay!"}
{"text":"If you're in Phoenix you need to stop what you're doing and go to this amazing all vegan bakery and get a tsoynami (soy blizzard) treat. I recommend getting the mash where they mix in a mystery baked good item the best!"}
{"text":"Never a negative experience! My favorites: the soynami, hazelnut lattes, the donuts, scones, cookies, & the nami mcbagel.  Awesome atmosphere, great location, lovely artwork, & super close to Green to catch dinner before."}
{"text":"Reviewing the coffee bar half of the Nami theme only...

Nami has been the closest espresso bar to my home since opening late last year.  Seeing as the coffee bean is a central part of my daily existence, it took me long enough to make my first visit.  Unfortunately, I would have been fine just delaying it indefinitely.  I can appreciate the whole vegan thing if that's their deal - there's a niche market for that and somebody's got to fill it.  What is astonishing is the refusal to placate the non-vegan crowd (i.e. overwhelming majority) and carry some half & half.   Introducing almond milk to whatever you're drink may be is an utter waste of espresso - trust me on this one.  The novelty of the concept, the trendy and energetic vibe, and the friendly baristas are among Nami's merits.  It's not the kind of coffee house that beckons you to sit down with a laptop or a book while you sip your favorite hot drink.  Hard, uncomfortable seats encourage you get what you came for and take it for the road."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous!  Cupcakes, cake, brownies, doughnuts, cookies... always an excellent variety of treats, and all very tasty.  

Also, Sunday brunch is not to be missed- I've never seen so many vegan breakfast options.  They also allow overflow seating next door at Green, so if the brunch crowd gets hectic, you will still have a nice casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Not really into the healthy scene so much but was pleasantly surprised when i tried nami. My family got the chick-o-stick soynami and was delicious."}
{"text":"I have suffered with Celiacs Disease for the last year. So it makes perfect sense to price gouge those in need, right?

$3.75 for one (1) gluten-free cookie. 'Nuff said.

Shame on you."}
{"text":"I was absolutely blown away by how good my dough boy tsoynami was! The restaurant  presentation is average at best but don't be fooled by that. This place is one of the best dessert venues in all of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I stop by Nami every single time I eat at Green next door. I have had about 5 of their baked goods. My favorite is the Lavender Cookies (light and yummy!) and my second favorite is their Pumpkin Pie (flaky and just enough sweetness). 

The ones I didn't like was the white chocolate Gluten Free Cookies because they were super hard and too sweet. The compost bar was suuuuuuper sweet. If you like sweet, than I recommend these, but it was too sweet for me. 

Of course the Tsoynami(s) are crazy good. Surprisingly, the peanut butter/chocolate is simple, but delish! I love the Almond Quixote! They are kind of big for me, so I always share with a friend. 

The most exciting part is that EVERYTHING is VEGAN! That is the best part since I am vegan. I am so happy that they opened this in Phoenix. 

The decor is super modern and neat. I love chillin' with my friends and hanging out here. I am going again soon!"}
{"text":"Yum! Just finished off the Rocky Road tSoynami with pretzels instead of chocolate chips. It was magical. The pretzels remained crunchy till the very last bite.. Very exciting.


I love that the base is VEGAN and ORGANIC. Eating 16 ounces of ice cream never made me so happy!!!!"}
{"text":"So many choices to choose from! A bit pricey but I would eat the soy soft serves everyday if I was closer. The cashier was extremely friendly and didn't mind that my friend and I stared at the menu for hours"}
{"text":"Name has the dankest soft-serve soy ice cream! Sometimes there is a long wait for a Tsoynami, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!! As a lactose intolerant person this is my go-to place for ice cream cravings and milk shakes. Can't go wrong with the dough boy tsoynami! It may be a 15 minute drive from my house, but it is SO worth it. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm, need I say more?  You had  The Hubs at \"vegan blizzard\" and did not disappoint."}
{"text":"A friend discovered Nami shortly after I assisted him in his transition to the plant based lifestyle. We originally referred to tsynami's as \"sex in a cup\", they are that good. Now that chocolate is offered, they are even better, if that is even possible. They always have gluten free options available and Sunday brunch is so filling and delicious. I am thrilled that breakfast is offered daily now as well. Coffee and dairy free milk selection is fantastic and staff is always friendly and inviting, often remembering me, even after long absences. I recommend this to anyone who is willing to explore plant based options. It is a great place for those transitioning or have an issue with dairy."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, I'm not a vegetarian. Who am I kidding, I go to filibertos five times a week and eat chicken nuggets every minute.
I tend to stay away from vegan/vegetarian food because its fake - meat like items and that makes me even more nervous than whatever saw dust that's in my chicken nuggets. HOWEVER, nami is GREAT. All their food was delicious and the BLIZZARD. DEAR GOD, THE BLIZZARD/ICECREAM. 
As a self-certified icecream expert, this is hands down, the best ice cream I have ever had in my entire life. That includes my travels in other countries, through different states, and raiding the entire freezer section of my local Fry's. The taste is great, the price is great, the texture is - wow, the texture is fantastic. I had my doubts but it was delicious. 
If it was closer to me I would buy it every day."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for just 2 days and managed to hit this spot up twice!!!! I really wish they had one in LA.

All vegan blizzards, tons of baked goods=my paradise!

My favorites were the Monsoon special (choc cake, choc chips, and choc syrup) which I added PB too and another one with pretzels, PB and chocolate chips.

Can't wait to come back on my next trip to Phoenix. They have a sister veg restaurant next door that I can't wait to try too (yes I may have just eaten Tsoynamis for dinner)."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim on the way home from getting an early morning haircut. I was hungry, saw a coffee shop and pulled in. Had no idea it was a vegan coffee shop! The pastries looked amazing, and I got a vegan sausage breakfast burrito. Was awesome. I would recommend this place to all my friends, vegans and non-vegans alike"}
{"text":"Great ice creams,great customer service.I would recommend this place highly,especially to anyone who is GF."}
{"text":"The Tsoynami was ruined me. FREAKIN RUINED ME. I don't like regular ice cream now. I felt refreshed after finishing the Dough Boy, which after eating non-vegan ice cream I wouldn't have. You can't even tell it's not ice cream except that it is more icy than milk and doesn't have the gross aftertaste. Drooling thinking of it right now..."}
{"text":"As if the Tsoynami's weren't good enough, I tried brunch here for the first time this weekend and it was soooo good. I got the Benedict as a plate - tofu scramble, asparagus, tempeh bacon and hollandaise served over chibatta bread. I also got the Cactus Haboob Latte - agave and cinnamon infused and it was to die for. Vegan or not, go to this place! 

It fills up quick though, so get there early or expect a little wait!"}
{"text":"I had only tried this place once but I plan to go back. The place is small but I like the decor.  The lady who helped me was nice. The tSoynami was amazing! I didn't think it was going to be that tasty but it was. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, and I LOVE THIS PLACE.  Everything I've gotten here has been great. During my most recent visit I got the \"Mash Mystery,\" I have no idea what it was. But it was DAMN good. They also have coffee if your in the mood for that!"}
{"text":"I'm always trying to find new places that offer vegan & gluten free bakery options and this place does not disappoint. I love that they make their own nut milks and the coffee was right on. Will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"We came here after years of seeing all of their great treats on social media. We were sorely disappointed when we arrived, and they only had a handful of options to choose from. We ended up with a cookies + cream cupcake and snickerdoodle cookie sandwich. Both were good, and we appreciated that the frosting in the cookie sandwich wasn't overly sweet. Hopefully they'll start sharing their daily offerings on social media so people don't waste time going there to find they are very limited in their options."}
{"text":"I had thee best vegan chocolate chip cookie dough icecream here!! The atmosphere is a unique mix of hip and relaxation. The staff is really friendly and I cant wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"Best vegan ice cream. Love the chocolate clunky monkey. Usually busy. Nice outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"I was recently on a trip to Phoenix and we decided to check out nami for dessert after lunch next door at Green New American Vegetarian. We were a little too full for a tSoynami so we each had one blueberry fritter (large donut hole size). They were very good! We went and did some sightseeing and came back (only slightly shamefully) a couple hours later for tSoynamis. I had the Doughboy (vanilla soft serve, chocolate sauce, and cookie dough) and my companion had the Donatello (vanilla soft serve, caramel, chocolate sauce, chocolate chips, and pecans). These were like I remember Blizzards being! Soooo good. I haven't had anything like it since I became vegan 11 years ago. I would be in serious trouble if I lived in Phoenix since once upon on a time I had a serious Blizzard / DQ addiction. Please come to Portland, maybe? :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this little dessert shop!!! 
It had the cutest atmosphere and so many choices. The staff was very friendly and i was little confused when it came to ordering, but they were very helpful. I came with my closed minded non vegan family and they thought the desserts wouldn't taste good, but they were proved wrong! The chocolate raspberry case was sosososo delicious. We also got a few tsoynamis. The betterfinger, a chocolate one, and the mash up. I really enjoyed the mash up. The texture with the added baked good made it very fun. I've never been too big of a fan of soy Ice creams, but I really enjoyed this one! 
One thing that intrigued me that I didn't order was the orange juice with espresso. I've never even heard of anything of the sort end I definitely want to try it out sometime. I wish there was a location where I live in California!  I'm just going to make sure to stop by the next time I'm in Arizona :)"}
{"text":"Pretty new at eating vegan and I've enjoyed looking for different places to eat. Had been looking forward to checking this place out. Walked in and stood there for a couple of minutes. Someone in front of me was being helped, but no one else working there acknowledged me at all. That's awful to not get any customer service at a place that I have been looking forward to going to. I would not recommend anyone to go here and that's just too bad. I wouldn't even give it one star, but I guess I have to."}
{"text":"Better come here ASAP if you are a Phoenician and vegan. Amazing selections and everything is vegan. All the soft serve soynamis are delicious and you have to try the house made vegan cream for the coffee. Would go every morning if could/lived closer. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Always amazing service and delicious selection of treats to fulfill your Vegan sweet tooth :D BEST Sticky Buns(cinnamon rolls) MUST try but they go quick so get there early! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Nami has great donuts. They are like a cross between the cake donut and the more airy donut. They are chewy and more substantial than the airy-type donuts. The donuts are really delicious. The tsoynamis are always good. Their grits are cheesy (vegan cheesy) and come with half a roasted jalapeño on the top, so you can cut it up and spice up the dish, but the grits are one of the best things on the menu. I've always loved their spicy wings. I feel like they are still getting their feet wet on some other items, and hope they improve over time. The scramble, for instance, is somewhat dry and flavorless. The hash potatoes, which are usually a favorite of mine, are also somewhat dry and flavorless. If they could improve on those two things, I think it would be much better. They usually have a special each weekend. Get there right when they open if you want a big donut selection. The place is packed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but I brought some friends who were visiting and have recently become vegan.  They absolutely loved it.  There was a large group of us there for breakfast so we had the chance to try several different things.  Friends loved their biscuits and gravy and I liked my breakfast burrito, although next time I'll probably skip the melty vegan cheese.  Everything is vegan and they have gluten free options on top of that so I'll definitely be taking some family there when they come to visit (multiple allergies/food sensitivities).  Their donuts were light and fluffy, unlike other vegan pastries I've had.  Can't wait to come back to try some of their other desserts and coffee drinks.  The best surprise was the pitaya bowl.  The purée is so light and refreshing and goes well with the granola and fruit on top.  It was even better than the acai bowl another friend tried.  I don't know that I would go for any savory items again if I didn't have any vegans with me, but I'll definitely be back for coffee, dessert and pastries and probably the pitaya bowl!  We're also sad we missed the special brunch.  I guess they only serve that on certain days.  I would have liked to try their pancakes and French toast."}
{"text":"Delicous looking pastries, and pleasant atmosphere.  Its a great alternative to have.  I'm not the biggest sweet fan, and definately not sold on all the crap that goes into vegan foods and sweets, but if one must indulge then this ain't a bad way to go.  I love the location and how nice they keep it.  Its so much nicer thant he original Green."}
{"text":"Love love love Nami Sweets!!!! It's great that there are vegan options for people who eat a vegan diet and have a sweet tooth.  I have brought family members here who eat dairy, and they loved the vegan desserts just as much! Cant wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot! I can't have dairy and all other vegan ice creams I have had have been subpar, but this place is amazing!! I get the chunky monkey tsoynami  (banana and chocolate) with marshmallow fluff and even though I'm ridiculously picky, the staff are always so patient and accommodating! The last couple times I went I had the pleasure of Marissa helping me and she is just as sweet as the treats  I strongly recommend this place to everyone, vegan or not!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place roughly 10 times now. My main server recognizes me now when I step in ther. We took a lot of friends with us and each time they loved it.
The restaurant itself is so nice and clean (up to the bathrooms that are spotless) and the ambiance is on the zen side with very neat decoration and wooden tables, Awsome.
Then comes the menu, We always went for the all you can eat menu and loved every roll we expeienced, It is of course on the \"fusion\" side of sushis, so you might found some strange combinations in one roll, but they are all surprisingly delicious and fresh.
There was one time we went there was a huge group comming for a birthday party (about 30 ppl) and it looked like a blast so I might think about it for a party someday.

All in all a 10/10 for me and my friends and family."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we frequented this place many times. The bakery items were delicious but the biscuits and gravy are a must. The French toast was amazing as well as the breakfast wraps. The tofu scramble was pretty good but the potatoes were generic. The staff was always friendly. The prices are high but I've come to expect that at vegan restaurants."}
{"text":"Yeah!   Love this place!!  Went for coffee, nothing special an Americano...it was so creamy and delicious!  Wonder what they use for soy milk?  While I was there, directly after eating at green, I could not resist the soy soft serve tsunami...hope I'm spelling that right.  Chocolate and peanut butter with chocolate chips, so awesome!  Makes me want to move downtown so I can go to Nami at least once a day!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get cruelty-free pastries, donuts, soft serve ice cream, or any other yummy delight. Their Sunday brunch is to DIE for, and beats any non-vegan food in existence. I'm not exaggerating either, this place is a game-changer for everyone's taste buds. And not only that, the service is fantastic and the servers are always super friendly."}
{"text":"The cup size is wayyyy smaller now!..it was twice the size a few months ago...they don't fill it to the top all the way either. For $5.50 , i should atleast have it filled up all the way. Sure its delicious..but kinda a letdown. :/ i could get a larger amount for the same price at Loving Hut. The employees have a better attitude. Nami Lost our buisness"}
{"text":"Loved this little place! A hidden gem for vegans and vegetarians! I went very early in the morning and had a small breakfast and coffee--everything was delicious and the service was excellent. I loved the atmosphere too! They were also listening to great music. It made my experience even better. The best part was how affordable it was! I was pleasantly surprised by this place and will definitely be coming back my next time in town."}
{"text":"Bomb @$$ breakfast burritos. Been there 3 times now and never been disappointed. I even have meat eaters I've taken with me who will tell you its absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Holy yumminess!!!! Ok so I'm a meat eater, but prefer my veggies and this place would totally turn me into a vegan if I only knew how to make their dishes. We have been frequenting this place for Sunday brunch and working our way to sample the entire menu. My absolute fave is the sage sausage  hash as you can't even tell it's vegan and it is perfectly seasoned. Make sure you save room for the tsoynami. I am the biggest froyo fan but this tsoynami goodness has totally turned my world of icy food upside down. It's honestly the best frozen dessert I've had although I really have to slow down cause as healthy as it is being tofu/soy based all that extra sugar from all the toppings do not make it easier on this hip and I will still end up looking like a vegan fat whale."}
{"text":"I just discovered their AFFOGATO! It's divine! No, really. I have no words for how fantastic it is. I will never sleep again."}
{"text":"The ice cream is great, even though they have somehow defied logic and left out all dairy items. Bravo. I'll be back to this cool neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"I have been here twice once with a coworker that is Vegan and once with my wife. I haven't had a lot of vegan ice cream so I have nothing to compare it to but as soft serve ice cream it's so so not bad but not oh my good this is good. The cupcakes are really moist but for my taste the frosting is just a little to much. But that is just my taste if you like a big frosting this might be for you. Just and FYI if you have a low car it can be difficult to turn in and get out of the parking lot. But that has nothing to do with my rating."}
{"text":"Frittersssss are seriously addicting. We get coffee here almost every morning....and fritters every. morning. too...... staff is fun and friendly. Different artist work on the walls each month. Brunch! On Sunday's they have a special. Oh and can't forgets the vegan donuts and all the rest of the yummy desserts like Tsoynami! (Vegan ice cream)"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place the ambiance, the staff, THE FOOD  
come early on Sunday's, though, things go fast. I Really wanted chulaquiles and a spinach quiche Sunday, it was about 12 and they were out! Other than that, love it."}
{"text":"On the same night my friend and I went to Green, we stopped here to get some vegan sweets.  We decided on cookies.  I think she ordered a snickerdoodle, and I ordered a chocolate chip cookie.  The cookies were good; however, it took a bit of time for us to get them.  They were right in the case, and I'd say we waited a good 10 minutes or so, and not sure why it took that long for us to receive them.

On my last day in Phoenix, we returned here to each try a tSoynami treat.  She had the banana cream pie flavor, and I ordered the PB and chocolate, and we were both LOVING our treats!  Very yummy and excellent to cool you down on a hot Arizona day!  Will also be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Cool little spot.  Service was average, nothing spectacular.  We tried the Nami stuff. Different, but good."}
{"text":"I love Nami's \"Cactus Haboob\" latte, which has a yummy cinnamon agave flavoring that is perfect for my taste buds.  I also like the turkey melts, breakfast burritos, and huckleberry pancakes here.

The prices are pretty reasonable, the cafe itself is really cute, and the staff are very sweet."}
{"text":"This place is my saving grace. I can't eat dairy or gluten and this has an option for both! everything they have is vegan. Some things are gluten free. It's amazing. The staff is also super friendly. 
Parking is a bit weird, but not too terrible for a downtown area. I'll always come back to this place!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for work recently.  After picking up my rental car, I was in dire need for coffee.  I did a quick yelp search and decided to check out Nami, as it was somewhat on the route to my destination.  The barista greeted me when I walked in and was very friendly when letting me know all the milk alternative options.  I decided to be slightly adventurous and try coconut milk with my latte.  I'm not sure if I particularly liked coconut milk, but it was worth a try.

It was very hot and toasty in Phoenix and I ordered a hot coffee instead of an iced coffee.  Not sure why I didn't think to order an iced one...  despite the hot coffee on a very hot day, I still enjoyed it.  Thank Nami for providing me with caffeine :)"}
{"text":"Variety of sweets, treats, coffees, ice creams, etc., and they're all VEGAN! Very friendly. Good vibe. They accept any and everyone into their facility :-) LGBTQ and straight people too lol"}
{"text":"Had to write an update since they now serve brunch on Sundays.

I went in and was slightly disappointed to see that just about everything was with tofu scramble (not the hugest tofu fan), but I made a selection: The Benedict Arnold.  Made up of roasted asparagus, Canadian \"bacon\", \"hollandaise\", and scrambled tofu.  You can get it in a bowl (for the gluten-free kids), or wrapped in a tortilla.  I chose the tortilla, cause well...I love a damn good burrito!  

It came out, and I was ready.  First bite in, and I knew we had a winner!  The combination of all flavors was perfection to my taste buds.  They have a decent selection to choose from, including: cinnamon rolls, yogurt parfaits, other burrito or bowl delights, coffees and juices, and more.

It was a nice brunch experience and hope to come back for more."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about this place. The Food is delicious and all dairy free. The staff is really nice and helpful. Did i mention that the food is delicous? Sunday brunch is a treat and they seem to be super busy. Go support local vegan business."}
{"text":"Yummy Nami! The tSoynami is so delicious here! I've tried quite a few of them, but Don Quixote is my favorite! My fiancé who is all about regular ice cream absolutely loves the dough boy tSoynami! I love the coffee & the cup cakes too! You won't be disappointed with whatever you try here. It's a small shop with scarce seating, but they have a few outdoor tables. The parking can be a tight squeeze and limited and the prices here can be pricey, but it's well worth it for a tasty treat!"}
{"text":"The serving size for the \"tsoynami\" (soy soft serve blended with treats) was pretty generous!  Not Costco yogurt generous but still a nice large size for $4.50 before tax and tip.

I chose the mint Newman O one (don't recall the cutesy menu name).  It was really a lot better than I excepted.  It could've used another pump or two of mint syrup/flavor though, and the chocolate syrup tasted a little cheap (like Hershey's).

Pulling into the parking lot was not fun, but thankfully they weren't crowded and it wasn't rush hour yet!

Overall, a nice non-dairy alternative to the Blizzards and Concrete Mixers of the world."}
{"text":"Quick takeout service and the Oatmeal cream cookie was so much better than I expected. Made me realize I can eat plant based without giving up flavor."}
{"text":"I am such a huge fan!! I was in Phoenix for three nights.. and I came to Nami three times! If I lived in Phoenix, I would surely be a regular!

I twice stopped in for a tsoynami, which is the vegan answer to a blizzard. I tried the \"Betterfinger\" one night and the peanut butter and chocolate kind the second. Always they were delicious. I wish more places were doing this soy soft serve!

I also came for breakfast on a Saturday morning. I ordered a bagel sandwich with tofu, tempeh, and vegan cheese. It was really good, and it came with a side of fruit. The only critique would be that it took a really long time. But good things come to those who wait!

I also grabbed an apple fritter for my breakfast the next morning, as I had an early flight to catch and no time to find something vegan to eat downtown or at the airport. Even after surviving the night in my hotel's mini fridge, it was awesome.

Thumbs up all around for Nami!"}
{"text":"It takes a great deal to push me to review an establishment, good or otherwise and I have written few. 
Whenever I'm in town, Green has been my standby for a couple of years now for its vegan selections, and this time around I took my family to Nami for the first time. For starters, my tea had finally come out with no almond milk. Easy fix. Didn't think anything of it. Brunch is a busy time for them and can understand that there are many chances for mistakes, however we noticed after a while that guests who ordered well after us were finishing their meals. We followed up and got an apology and we were fine with the explanation of their miscommunication within the kitchen. So to pass the time, I had ordered a mimosa from green and asked for different juice option. ($7 for a less than an 8oz mason jar). The lady misunderstood my order that I had already paid for and when I saw her finishing the pour of oj, I tried to explain that wasn't what I meant at all. Her reply \"I already poured it.\" No matter that I already paid for it tho, right? She served the mimosa with a side cup and I asked her what that was for. She explained that the cup was for the juice order. Clearly another mix up and she refunded me for the juice. 20 min later, our food had finally arrived. I asked for the chiliquiles with no potatoes and it showed up loaded with potatoes. I pointed it out to our server, again, very apologetic and willing to correct it and add more scramble in place of. No problem there, except it came back with potatoes on it still. I had then asked to make a new one since their idea of a remedy was to simply remove the potatoes, and our server agreed to my request. The order came back with a hair on the plate and my moms fruit also had a hair. That said and also after tipping generously at the time of order, I decided to ask for a manager from Green. As it happens the cashier who took my mimosa order was the manager. I took her aside away from the table to explain our experience had been unusually below par and that I am a loyal customer. Her response was one that lacked empathy and not even made any kind of act or offer of righting the wrongs of the experience. And at that point, i knew what I had to do. Thank you for reading and I hope others get better service/treatment than we did. 

As for myself, my friends and family who I recommend, these two establishments has seen my last dime and now what was once a recommendation will now be a that of a warning."}
{"text":"VEGAN DONUTS.  Delicious, amazing, glorious VEGAN DONUTS.  WE went for the biscuits and gravy but when we saw these beautiful gems sitting in the case, beckoning us, it was all over.  We had a cinnamon donut.  So fresh, and springy and delightful.  It has been one of the only things I have craved but had been unable to satisfy since transitioning to vegan.  But now, finally, a fabulous solution.  

We also enjoyed the biscuits and gravy  and the mcbagel sandwich.  Both were extraordinary.  The B/G was huge.  Next time we will share.  Potatoes were cooked to a beautiful brown perfection.  The Tofu scramble is some of the best I have encountered but the star of the show, by far was the gravy.  Creamy and satisfying with large chunks of \"chorizo\".

The McBagel sandwich was also a thing of outstanding craftsmanship.  The bagel soft and delicious.  The tofu egg and veggie ham had perfect spice and flavoring.  I'm not sure how they make the \"cheese\" but it is AMAZING.  This little gem came with a side of fruit.  Boring and expected one may think.  However, this fruit was clearly freshly cut and perfectly ripe.  NO soft grapes, hard cantaloupe or honeydew here my friends.  This was beautiful, bite size chunks of granny smith apple, perfectly ripened strawberries and sweet pineapple.

My one complaint about NAMI.  I live in Mesa and it is in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a million times but never stopped. Neither my husband or myself are vegan... but dairy sucks. Which makes eating ice cream really difficult... especially when you love ice cream. We just moved to the area and I really wanted ice cream, so we stopped here. The ice cream is delicious and lactose intolerant approved."}
{"text":"A vegan restaurant...the menu is limited and a little on the pricey side... but isn't everything else in the country?!    The faux eggs and sausage was surprisingly good!   If you don't want one of their drinks.. you can have water and ice in the back, near the kitchen area.   There's two restrooms outside, and they're very clean and modern.   Parking is very bad st this place... its like parking in an alleyway.   There wasn't any parking, so we parked in the restaurant a couple of doors down (no one ticketed us or put a warning, etc.   I'm sure they're use to it by now)."}
{"text":"LOVE this place offers so many vegan options! Their stuff is delicious and they have great service 100%recommended."}
{"text":"How can you not like Nami? Delicious pastries, brunch, coffee, and killer service. Need I say more? I visit this place often and I love their yogurt parfait! Please go. Enjoy some sweets paired with a hot cup of coffee and take all your friends there."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place! Customer service was outstanding! I wasn't sure what to get, so I asked the friendly girl behind the counter for her recommendation. She was very helpful and I ended up getting the cactus haboob latte with almond milk. It was phenomenal. Will definitely be returning here on my next trip to Phoenix!  Thanks for the great start to my morning, Nami. And a big thank you to the girl behind the counter that was kind enough to help me find the perfect drink on their menu!!"}
{"text":"If your not a vegan definitely don't come come here. The soft serve tasted horrible, it tasted like ice with a hint of flavor. Also, the costumer service was horrible because there was a 30 min wait for the soft serve and the employees had a lot of sass for no reason. I was shocked I had a bad experience because a friend recommend it, but unfortunately it wasn't what I was expecting."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! My daughter was just diagnosed with like 20 food allergies and this place was one of the only allergy friendly options I had to take her so she knew that there were still good food options out there. So important for a teenager to know!! And the food is yummy too!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and my gf ordered the macadamia nut milk latte and the strawberry fritters. We loved it all. Even thinking about going back to grab more of the fritters and trying out their breakfast. It's hard to find a good vegan joint around phoenix. The search is over! Definitely will be coming back to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down best ice cream in Phoenix. Creatively delicious vegan mixes that consist of classics as well as seasonal additions (Pumpkin pie mix is to die for). Always leaves your gut feeling good too!"}
{"text":"Grits were excellent - spicy, cheesy (or well cheese-like) hominy chunks rather than instant packet grits. Servings are big for sides as well. I rather create my own meal of sides rather than an entree. As a vegetarian, I went between here and Green next door my whole Phoenix stay. 

The only thing that stuck out to me was when I ordered a pour over, before I even finished paying I received it. What? One of the main aspects of a pour over is that it's brewed fresh for you, cup by cup. Instead, I got coffee that was already made from a vat or percolator. It tasted rather watery and flavorless. More akin to diner coffee. Okay, maybe the pour over was pre-made and poured cup by cup into a giant vat. Who knows? That is more time consuming than what it's worth. Just sell drip coffee and call it drip coffee and charge less."}
{"text":"I doscovered the little gem in my search to find a new breakfast place. I was delighted to see such great reviews by other Yelpers.

I pulled onto the parking lot and was directed by an employee that the blue building is not Nami, but the one next door. Helpful as the two share a parking lot.

The inside of Nami is quaint with retro fruniture and art mixed in with little cacti in the windowsills and proud displays that they are open to all.

The menu stretches across the wall and features assorted coffee drinks, pastries and a lovely hot breakfast menu. From what I could tell, all of the items are organic.

I ordered a samoan but received a samoan bar instead of samoan donut instead. This was quickly remedied by the friendly cashier. The hot chocolate was also delightful with almond milk, my favorite.

They also had a small offering of other items such as boxed crackers, cookies, candy, etc.

Their restroom out back was decorated in a modern style.

The prices are comparable to the chain coffee shops and I would much rather shop local!"}
{"text":"Love you Nami. A good collection of delicious house made vegan pastries. 
And the real reason we always came to Nami....... For the yummy Tsoynami's. 
Great list of choices for what you liked. And they are perfect size. Not too small and not too big. Last time i was at Nami they cost $5. But ive been told the price went up a little.  Ive looked and i cannot find any place here in Portland similar to Nami. I even got my meat eating, cow dairy loving friends hooked on the Tsoynami's. They would all finish the whole Tsoynami. Nothing left in the cup. (Lol) thats how darn good they are. And some times would go for a second one.  Great average sized seating area inside and patio seating out front or in the back.
We never got over there for breakfast but its some thing i wished i did. I usually went to Nami in the afternoon or at night.
If you ever think of branching out. Please come to Oregon Portland to be specific."}
{"text":"The long awaited, much anticipated CenPho brother to Green is HERE! 

While this isn't another Green location (don't worry! they will open soon!), Nami serves a huge menu of their delicious tsoynamis and a variety of other baked goods.  This little cafe is all vegan, and while my vegetarian diet allows me to overindulge in regular ice cream -  these tsoynamis could convert me. I had a flufflernutter (note: NOT a sexual term, but instead a mixture of peanut butter and marshmallow cream) tsoynami that was heavenly and huge. YUM!

I did not try any coffee but am very excited to. They offer soy, almond and rice milk - with promises to add more nut varieties soon. Nami offers a beautiful selection of pastries - cupcakes, whoopie pies, cookies.

The staff here was amazingly friendly and welcoming.  I felt like they genuinely cared about my business, as well as any comments or suggestions that we had.    

I am glad that I get to be the first review, since I was their FIRST customer. This vegan-niche is much needed in Central Phoenix and I am so stoked for what Nami and Green will bring to it!"}
{"text":"Delicious treats, desserts, smoothies, coffees, and food! I found this place on Yelp and after finally deciding to try it out yesterday, I was amazed at how yummy my donut was! I came back today and got the Pitaya Power Breakfast. It is a must try. PLEASE OPEN A NAMI IN TUCSON!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best place for dietary restrictive date nights! If you don't have any dairy issues, you'll still love this place. Sooo good! 

Good things take time, so be prepared for your yummy to take a bit of time. It's made when you order."}
{"text":"The vegan Samoa bar was HUGE--enough for two people. Totally something to share! Nice ambience, too."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. It's vegan so it's nice since you don't get congested or anything because of the dairy. The ice cream tastes good and the cookie dough that they put in the dough boy is amazing! Its my favorite there. I could eat it alllll day. Only problem is that it's kinda hard to park since it's small. Usually you can find a spot though. It was packed today, but they were very fast with getting the orders out which was fantastic. I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Service was very kind and welcoming and that is the main reason I'm giving it 3 stars. The restaurant allows you to bring your own wine which is always a plus. When I had originally looked into this \"all you can eat\" both the website and reviews indicated 25$ but when I got there it was advertised outside and the menu's as 27.99$ which wasn't a big deal but I feel like they should have been consistent in advertising (I come from the westisland so I travelled pretty far). My favourite item on the menu was the Vietnamese soup. This is where they lost stars. If your a big sushi lover like myself, I do not recommend this place. The rolls consisted of too much rice and the fillings were mushy and spoiled. Also, the sushi rice was not anywhere near to being seasoned enough. The one thing that makes up a good roll of sushi is the rice ! Presentation was average. This resto is Vietnamese origin and I recommend only going for that time of food, not sushi all you can eat."}
{"text":"My rating is based solely off the German Chocolate cake I bought for my husbands birthday. It was super super sweet and the icing was very thick and tasted like store bought. Sadly, I was disappointed and would not go back for cakes. I might go back to try other things but, if the cake was any indication of the quality of other items I am leery."}
{"text":"I just got a cupcake so my rating is based solely on that.  For $4 you're expecting either it to be bigger or the flavor to be better. It is equal parts cupcake to frosting, stored in a fridge so it is cold and hard. Not fresh (which what do you expect when they don't specialize in just cupcakes) and icing was very hard and made cupcake impossible to eat and fell off. Okay flavor. Recommend trying another dessert."}
{"text":"I live in Portland, the apparent mecca of all things vegan. Surprisingly, there is one thing we don't have here that Phoenix does: the tsoynami.

\"Isn't it just vegan soft serve?\" you say. \"Anyone can make that. You have that in Portland!\"

Um, it's not just vegan soft serve! It's extra thick, extra creamy, not-too-sweet vegan soft serve. And then they put stuff in it! Completely different. It's basically a veganized Blizzard. Not only do they have the classic combinations you remember from the DQ (banana cream pie? with vegan nilla wafers?), but they have their own delightful and creative combinations. I'm kind of embarrassed by how many of these things I've eaten since I've spent a total of maybe three days in Phoenix, but my favorite combination is Cap'n Crunch Berries and strawberries. Maybe you're like me, and somehow the seemingly obvious combination of cereal and ice cream has eluded you until now. Well, go to nami and the nice folks there will set you straight about that.

The only thing I wish they would improve is the whipped cream. If, like me, you are not a fan of coconut, then it tastes overwhelmingly like coconut. I know some people like coconut, or don't think it clashes with whatever dessert they are eating, but I don't think the flavor of coconut belongs in my banana cream pie tsoynami, okay? I know, I sound ungrateful. However, it does not stop me from literally mandating that we stop and get tsoynamis every time we're in Phoenix. It shouldn't stop you, either! Just maybe order something without that."}
{"text":"all vegan dessert and pastry shop, my heaven!!! Love coming here for a treat, usually stick with ice cream but I've had their doughnuts and they are really good. Pretty small place but there is outdoor seating. It's a coffee shop set up and they do have coffee and drinks. It's kind of like a vegan version of Bosa (except they sell out of donuts really fast) with cookies, cake, and ice cream too. I believe this js their main tsoynami ice cream hub because I see more seasonal options at this location. Their weekend brunch menu is fantastic. They have a vegan quiche, burritos, french toast, biscuits and gravy. Tons of good eats all veganized and they really hit the spot, also love their seasonal options. Had a pumpkin cream filled donut with pecan toppings, so good! And it wasn't too much filling, they had a little  in the very center, it was perfect. My go too spot for vegan cravings (green has salads and grain bowls but it's not somewhere I come for something light/healthy. Definitely recommend for bringing non-veg friends who want to try veg food."}
{"text":"I didn't realize that Nami is the coffeehouse arm of Green. I came for breakfast (okay it might have been more like lunch) and was overwhelmed with the choice of baked goods. I got a pour over coffee (which I wasn't all that wowed by, but it was good), the huevos rancheros, and a blueberry fritter. 

I definitely didn't need all that food but I had to try it all. The blueberry fritter was awesome. Nami definitely does a great job with their vegan baked goods. The vegan huevos rancheros was an interesting take on the classic dish. It had hash browns, chili-spiced black beans, tofu, and some kind of mystery bean or protein that I couldn't figure out what it was.

Nevertheless it was all pretty good. Not to mention, the place was packed, which is always a good sign. However, don't go there on a weekend expecting to get a seat. Very limited seating and for all the people there, it was a slim chance. Especially with loners like me taking up a whole table."}
{"text":"This place is always my number 1 recommendation for brunch/breakfast in the Phoenix area. I've taken vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores and not once has anyone left less than amazed. The service is friendly and welcoming and the food always comes out quickly. Props to whoever selects the pastries and specials, they're always creative and delicious - captain crunch doughnuts, s'mores brownies, a different quiche per day, the list goes on. They also offer a wide selection of espresso drinks, milkshakes, and tsoynamis (vegan blizzards, essentially). 

No matter what you get here, you're going to be pleased. And don't think this place is only for vegans. Good food is good food regardless of meat/cheese/eggs/etc and this place always hits the spot."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. brought some treats back with me to california. :) the lavender cookies are yummy. and the dirty chai doughnut was phenomenal."}
{"text":"While you can find some of my favorites added to my post for Green I just tried an affogoto and I am hooked. I LOVE straight espresso so found myself eating spoon fulls of it straight but by the time i got to the bottom of my cup all that was left was tons of syrup. Next time I'll mix it all up and make myself a vegan flurry for sure. 

My friend Mariah works in here, if you see her or any of the staff you'll be greeted with a smile and the owners the man too. 

Definitely come in here for some vegan deliciousness but be ready for the post soy gas as well. 

Suggestions include peanutbutter chocolate bars, peanut butter frosted banana muffins, tsoynamis, and as stated above AFFOGOTOS! 

Oh one more tip, if you like chai get their desert haboob ;)"}
{"text":"We decided to take a coffee break at this cute little place when we were visiting Phoenix and saw Michael U's review.

We had: espresso shake and pistachio donut. I must admin that I'm a fan of their creations."}
{"text":"The service I received here was very cold and unfriendly. I will never come back here again. 

My girlfriend and I came by here to get lunch at Green on Sunday 3-23-14 around 1:45ish. We went into green and asked if they were open. They said \"not for another 15 minutes but food was ordered next door.\"  Ok no biggie. A sign would have been nice but whatever. We went to Nami where the person at the register (I really wish I got her name) gave me the worst experience. I was trying to find a lunch menu but was told \"We are serving brunch right now but only for another 10 minutes.\" When I asked what they served in 10 minutes she said in an unfriendly tone, \"we stop serving brunch. We are a coffee shop not a restaurant.\" 

After that we decided to leave and went across the street to Coronado café where we had a much better experience. (I will post a different review on that)

I'm not sure if all of their employees have this same attitude to would-be first time customers but customer service to me is very important for first impressions. 

This does make me sad since I was looking forward to trying something new."}
{"text":"Well, it's always my goal to try something different and that's definitely what Nami was! My boyfriend & I are by no means vegan, however we were in the area and he found this place under desserts on Yelp. We figured we'd stop in to give it a try. Was it good? .. By vegan standards, I think so? Would we return? Debatable.

The biggest problem we had at this place was that we didn't really understand what the menu items were. After a look over their offerings, I wanted just plain soft-serve, so I picked vanilla. Or more like \"vanilla\" I suppose. More than anything, it tasted super coconut-y. I'm not a fan of the coconut flavoring taste so that was disappointing as was the texture. It was almost just icy and not at all soft like what I'm used to. I did get used to it after a few bites but it almost felt like my teeth were hurting because the dessert was so cold!

My boyfriend was actually looking for a pastry and though the betterfinger would be tasty. A tsoy-nami is definitely not a pasty. It's more like what a concrete is from DQ for the non-vegan folk. I probably would have been better off ordering that since it actually had toppings to mask the flavor of the vanilla soft-serve. He also wasn't a fan of coconut taste but said that he didn't care for the texture more than anything else.

Like previously mentioned, I think by vegan standards, it was alright. Overpriced, however I've never had vegan ice-cream before. I suppose if I couldn't have regular milk, I'd probably come here to get a soy-based treat. The best part was that after eating my whole cup of soft-serve, I didn't feel like I had a sugar overload.

The staff was friendly but not very helpful. We saw a couple of customers there who seemed really annoyed, I'm guessing because they had to wait a while to get everything they had ordered. We didn't have to wait too long to get our order.

If you're in the area, check this place out. I'm interested in trying the vegan restaurant Green, which is right next to it."}
{"text":"Delicious, even as someone who is not a vegan.  The atmosphere is great and the coffee rivals some of the exclusively coffee-serving shops in Phoenix.  

That, and any place that serves tsoynamis are officially a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"This is the most overwhelming and beautiful place in the valley..it is definitely not for the indecisive. I am used to having a few vegan options at the average froyo shop or bakery, but here it is like vegan jesus created every amazing dessert in 7 days. 

The Mash is definitely the best and a gamble..so even better, especially because you can tell that the employees love making it and telling customers about it. I have never regretted ordering it. The only thing that you should worry about is spending too much because..it WILL happen.

ps bring some cash to tip with/ vote for your favorite theme of the day. its fun and the employees deserve a tip. when I was there it was zombies versus vampires and..being the walking dead fan that I am, it made it the easiest decision I had while I was there."}
{"text":"The gf is lactose intolerant, but LOVES ice cream. Major problem, until we discovered Nami. We love their tsoynamis! The soft serve is great and actually tastes like the real stuff. They have quite a few different flavor options with fresh and vegan toppings. They also sell coffee, tea, and vegan treats like pastries and donuts."}
{"text":"I like this place. My favorite is the oatmeal creme cookie when I can have it on rare occasions. Coffee is ok, but I see most people eating ice cream when I come for a visit. That said, please clean up the place between customers. Tables are always nasty and not wiped down after each customer. I have been in Nami dozens of times, but have never seen anyone cleaning tables."}
{"text":"Wut tha'.  All my friends (vegan/punx/activists/people who are 'conscientious') love Nami.  Yes, Tsoynami!  Uh huh.  So I took my kids there to see if it was the real deal.  My kids aren't vegans (that they've told me), so we were gonna figure it out.  

They loved it.  They even loved the atmosphere of the small establishment.  Kooky indie ambient sounds.  A girl with a bun atop her head but with a shaved head around the bottom.  High waisted shorts?  Yeah man.

But we got three Tsoynamis.  All different flavors.  They were like $4/5 each.  No biggie.  

I'll probably come back."}
{"text":"My friend was in need of a proper birthday cake from me, so a week later I suggested we get one from here cause the gluten free cupcakes are the best I've had. We ordered a gluten free strawberry blonde cake and they were able to ship it to the south Scottsdale/Tempe Green location to be picked up to save us driving time. She and her family thoroughly enjoyed the cake even though they weren't on a gluten and casein free diet like I am. I saved a slice for my bf and he nursed it for 20 min savouring each bite. I'm planning on getting him a horchata cake from here for his birthday."}
{"text":"Went in to get a gift card for some friends. Surprised to be charged a $5.00 fee to buy a gift card... I've never been charged to buy a gift card before. Sort of disappointing."}
{"text":"I LOVE Love this place!!! Super tasty and AAMmmmazing!!! 

Try the rocky road - walnut chunks with marshmallow fluff

almond joy tsoynami - loads of shredded coconut goodness

The only downfall was that one time their machine were down and they only had their baked goods available."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Good coffee and food. Great HUGE oatmeal cookies. I would honestly come here for the cookies alone."}
{"text":"Employee with short brown bob cut styled hair who was working on 05/30/2018 on the close shift Is the reason for this bad review. I came in at 9:25 and asked if I could order one thing, they closed at 9:30. I understand that I came close to closing time but I drove 100mph on the I10 to get nami for my ill relative. And I called ahead and was told that they would take my order as long as it was before close. I'm extremely annoyed and disappointed with nami and their shitty employee especially since I drove 30 minutes from Scottsdale Road and the 101. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The vegans should be ashamed!!! This is why I eat icecream that's has products in it that we're involved in extreme animal abuse because those icecream shops have never let me down."}
{"text":"Nami goodness for $5.  Chai tsunami, O ginger snap, rocky road and Coffee Coco Loco are all pretty phenomenal. Great for those that are lactose intolerant. Tastes light. These treats are tasty even when melted from the summer heat. Parking is limited."}
{"text":"It's really difficult to add anything original here because everyone else has already said it, but this place is simply amazing!  I have never tried anything here that I didn't like.  Their lattes especially are delicious.  The iced chai tastes very similar to Starbucks, for anyone who has become vegan and is no longer able to drink Starbucks chai because it has honey in it.  I also recommend the raspberry mocha.

All of their cupcakes and the McBagel and the burritos are great, too.

Just try the whole menu.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very interesting place. Not at all what I was expecting. I had an iced mocha (geez was it vegan lol? Now I wonder!) which was pretty good. Only drawback was that there was a tiny layer of melted ice at the top which generally indicates the espresso was poured over the ice instead of the proper way of adding the ice last (which may or may not have happened since I wasn't watching it being made, just my observation after years of being a bit of a coffee snob). I also tried the winkie because it was too novel not to. It was... Hard to explain except although it bore no taste resemblance to its toxic namesake, I would definitely eat one again. Very enjoyable and baby loved it too. 

I can't give 5 stars simply because I think there are tastier coffee places in town (and whose beans I always buy a crapton of so I can pull shots at home), BUT nevertheless this was a great spot and I'm glad I finally tried it. If you're a diehard vegan this would probably be your favorite coffee place. 

Also - on a side note - they charge extra for whipped cream. Kinda weird. As a consumer, nickeling customers for those little extras is off putting. Psychologically, I would rather the prices were a touch higher and included the whipped cream. Just the way the consumer mind works lol."}
{"text":"Super good stuff! I just wish the wait wasn't as long as in was for just a frozen yogurt! The layout is very modern and clean but a little small for how much clientele they bring in. I'll be back only because it was so delicious. 

I changed my rating to five stars because on my most recent trip this morning. Not only was the food delicious and nutritious. It was an awesome service and all the staff were super fun and engaging even with how busy they were. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Omg, the tsoynami (vegan soft serve ice cream with various toppings) is incredible! Fantastic and friendly service. Right next door to Green."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a vegan, gluten free cake for a special occasion, this place is tops in terms of flavor. I got my husband a peanut butter chocolate cake for his birthday, and it was fantastic. I've never had such a good gluten free cake before. What marred the experience was that my cake was damaged by the cashier when she put the lid down. They took it next door to the bakery to fix it, but it was still visibly damaged. I did contact the store to let them know of the incident, and they gave me a small gift card to make up for it. 

I returned a few days later to share some breakfast burritos with my mom and sister. I had heard about the wholly k-aioli on instagram, and I was dying to try it. It ended up being a kale overdose wrapped in a tortilla, but I loved the big ole breakfast burrito that my sister got. She switched me because she's cool like that. 

There are many more offerings, especially for brunch, that I have yet to try. Nami/Green knows how to do vegan junk food!"}
{"text":"I liked their coffee, and they had a really really nice and clean bathroom, which I really appreciated after eggs benedict."}
{"text":"So, apparently, when I've been here in the past and ordered a macchiato, I was given a CARAMEL macchiato. Which I did not order, but did enjoy. I was under the impression that their macchiato had a bit of caramel drizzled in it. WRONG! Tonight, I ordered a \"macchiato, 16oz please\" and was informed that it only comes in one size. Previously, more than once, I've ordered a 16 oz macchiato and I explained that to the gal tonight. She asked someone else there, who confirmed they only make it in one size. Ok, fine, I'll have the one size and please make two since I will want more than 12 oz. Then I stood there for 20 minutes, while they made every other customers' tsoynami's, even those who paid after me. I understand, they were busy, but it's just a coffee now.... The gal who rang me up, finally noticed me standing there and apologized, saying they would make my macchiato's right away. Which they did. I get back to work and take the lids off, and they aren't even filled up all the way. What the heck?! Upon sipping, it definitely is NOT the same thing I've received in the past when ordering JUST a macchiato. I never once have ordered it as a caramel macchiato, but I'm realizing now, that must have been what I was charged for, and what was made for me. Moral of my review... get it together guys. I love your products, and you are full of super nice employee's, but there needs to be a bit better communication between each of you, especially when busy, so that a coffee order isn't waiting for 20 minutes. And PLEASE instruct the sweet guy with longer brown hair and glasses, that when a customer orders a macchiato, it only comes in ONE size, and it's not the same thing as a caramel macchiato. ;-)"}
{"text":"Their coffee and donuts are soooo bad, but sooooooo good...."}
{"text":"Excellent baked goods ... couldn't tell the difference that they were vegan. So moist and tasty. Definitely recommmend...  I'll definitely be back to try other things - it is a bit pricey tho."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food over at Nami and appreciate the variety of all vegan items. With that being said I still decided to give 2 stars because of my last visit. If I come in before 10:30am but end up in the front of the line ordering after 10:30am, it doesn't seem fair that \"breakfast will no longer be served\" no matter how long I waited or taken into consideration when I actually stepped in the door. Staff was not friendly or accommodating. There was a whole line of people behind me also hoping to get food that were also told they couldn't order breakfast. Seems like Nami is just turning away money. It would make more sense to end breakfast at 11am so that people can walk over to Green but instead there's an awkward 30 minute gap until Green opens so I just decided to leave and get food elsewhere. Disappointed with my last visit and this is the second time this has happened. Can't say I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"tsoynamis are the BEST! I'm not even vegan but I crave tsoynamis! instant favorite. cute place with art on the walls. cool place to meet friends, go after dinner. wish it was open a little later though."}
{"text":"VEGAN SOFT SERVE!!!

I was recently in Phoenix for a concert, and had a day to kill, so I searched around for good vegan spots in Phoenix.  Nami did not disappoint!

I had a Tsoynami, and a cupcake.  Man, the cupcakes look small, but they're sooooo rich!  Filling and delicious!  I couldn't even finish it all in one sitting!

The soft serve is so good and so unique to this location I keep finding myself searching for excuses to visit Phoenix.  I'll be back, for more Tsoynami!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner here for the first time last night with our 2.5 year old toddler. I'm guessing it was pretty empty because this place is pretty new. 

We went for the all you can eat option, which is roughly $24.00 per person, and free for kids under 3 years old. 

The fantastic thing about the all you can eat menu is that all roll orders are 2 pieces, which is fantastic because then you really can try almost all the different rolls on their menu (which is a lot) they are very creative, and the list of rolls seems endless. Fantastic rolls!

I love sashimi, and this is where they lose a star. The sashimi options are very very limited. I think it was only 6 or 7 choices, and I didn't love the sashimi I did get. 

The desserts are fabulous. We had the dessert rolls (mango, strawberry chocolate etc) and they were great. We also had the deep fried banana and ice cream, which we devoured. 

My favourite thing about this restaurant by far is our server Edith. She was quick, prompt and our water glasses were always full. She was friendly and absolutely amazing with my daughter. She spoke both french and English and was just altogether fantastic. I wish she was my server at every restaurant we ever went to."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious! We always get the chocolate Rocky Road blend and it's amazing each time! It's so nice and creamy we often split 1 cup between 2 people and it's a perfect dessert! We always come here because this is one of the only places in the Valley which serves vegan icecream which tastes like real icecream."}
{"text":"Went here for a little #SundayFunday aka cheat day indulgence... I had the Nami Cakes and I must say it was alright! Nothing spectacular, personally I feel like this place was over rated and and DEFINITELY over priced!!! I paid $4 for a little ass cupcake... Literally it wasn't even a regular sized cupcake! Highly disappointed, much rather would've spent less money for an extra 50 calories!!!!"}
{"text":"Only 10 min away from walking distant.
This is really really really good, also really really really bad.

I am almost finished with trying each soynami.... So far and not a fan of the one with banana.
YET EVERYTHING is.... just... just good. Place me on top of a Swiss alp let me sing, dance, and exclaiming goodness oozing. 

Also i can eat one and not feel lik I am creating havoc for my metabolism to compensate.

RL:

NOTE: Oddly takes an unusually amount of time to get into my hands. 10min?
Worth the wait, worth the walk, worth the extra chocolate ;)"}
{"text":"I came here when I was in Phoenix after eating at the vegan restaurant next store. They have a large variety of vegan pastries, many of which are gluten free, and vegan ice cream. I got three pastries, the strawberry cupcake (which I believe was gluten free), the yankee doodle (also gluten free I believe) and the chocolate, berry croissant. The strawberry cupcake was okay but the other two were amazing! The cake was kind of dense in the cupcake but I did enjoy the frosting and the fresh strawberry on top. The yankee doodle was 2 snickerdoodle cookies with frosting in the middle. It was amazing, one of the best vegan, gluten-free treats I've had. The cookies were moist and flavorful and the frosting sweet and delicious. The chocolate, berry croissant was excellent too. The croissant itself was good, but not quite as buttery and rich as a non-vegan one. The chocolate was more of a chocolate mousse and had very good texture and wasn't too sweet. It was also topped with some yummy fresh berries. I'm gonna try the ice cream next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The tsoynami was okay, but seemed overpriced for essentially the equivalent of your local DQ treat. Didn't try the coffee. The actually space is very small and not much of a coffee shop vibe (would not recommend for studying)."}
{"text":"Tried their chai tiramisu. It was overwhelmingly sweet for me. However, I liked that the ice cream is soy base and you can add whatever toppings you wish. I also ordered the almond latte and my hubby had the chai tea latte. Again, his drink was really sweet but mine was just right. 

I would come back again and try other kind of \"tsoynami\" and get my almond latte drink!"}
{"text":"I came here looking to try some new vegan options in my life. Thinking at the very least it would help my hangover. What i found was more than i could have imagined.

A unique venue with two buildings one housing a cafe-esque ordering are and the other the kitchen with enclosed dinning that allows just enough of the outside in to be pleasant. The staff was courteous and attentive. The options numerous and bounding with eccentric platters. 

Moving along, the important thing here is FOOD people , and it was amazing. While most things seem to mimic meat dishes with chorizo and eggs on the menu, Nami pulls of these imitations by making insanely more delicious vegan plates.

I was blown away by my \"Chicken wings\" the sauce was unlike anything i have had before and i was instantly in love. My OJ based concoction was also amazing as it had some kind of red syrup in the bottom that complimented the not too sweet OJ. 

Street pedestrians are not disruptive to your dinning experience and provides ample opportunity to people watch. 

All in all this place is a must go location if your trying for a healthy, creative, and delicious meal in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ok. Since I've become completely and totally addicted to tsoynamis, it's only fair that I update my review. At least once a week I find myself craving a tsoynami. Even my boyfriend, who is adamantly against vegan and soy products, has fallen in love with the tsoynamis and often accompanies me on my trips to get them. These desserts are also HUGE. For $4.50, you can easily split it between two people. I usually like to eat my own so I can bask in my gluttonous glory. All of the baked goods are also excellent. I have not been disappointed by anything I've had here. I've been converted to a Nami believer!"}
{"text":"Dairy-free soft serve?? Prayers answered!! Cute little place offering all vegan treats. Only had the ice cream and would go back for just that.  So good. Choco, vanilla and swirl...milkshakes, etc... pastries and what looks like a tasty brunch. Nice to order from a menu and not have to worry about 'the allergy' - super annoying dairy allergy... so happy to have found this."}
{"text":"For not being a dessert guy and a huge meat guy (could never understand this veggie vegan thing) Nami had some darn good desserts that weren't over sweet and had flavors that I don't normally taste in desserts.

Had a coffee and the donuts (vegan ones at that) and the fiancé ordered some chocolate cookie.  Actually for something very simply prepared the taste was really good.

The coffee tasted spot on with a good balance of bitterness and smoothness (put 2 sugars and just a splash of what I assume was cream)

So if your vegetarian or want a dessert that doesn't overload you with processed sugars, hydrogenated oils and other crap that is in most bulk desserts, check this place out."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE!! The tsoynamis are to d i e for...I went two days in a row! The carrot cake was delightful as well, there are plenty of dessert options. I'd recommend to everyone!! This is vegan heaven."}
{"text":"Their gluten-free vegan doughnut was out of this world good. However they have no decaf coffee options even for an Americano which sucks for me because I can't drink caffeinated coffee, so that is the only reason I took a star off and it would've only been a half star if that was possible. Service was great and friendly and the place is small and quaint."}
{"text":"I bought two items here, a slice of the Pistachio Rose Cake and a Coffee Cake donut. The cake slice was moist and baked well, also frosted beautifully, I thought for the amount the price was reasonable. I bought it for lunch and I was full! I bought a coworker the Coffee Cake donut and she liked it. The parking situation is tight and small so be careful and you can only enter on the South side of the building and you exit on the North side."}
{"text":"A great place for vegan desserts and other novelties. My non-vegan kids love their tsoynamis particularly the cookie dough infused Dough Boy."}
{"text":"A little overrated. Good tasting, but nothing out of this world. Unique in its being vegan."}
{"text":"Today is my second day in row coming here for breakfast. Yesterday, I ordered the Nami McBagel Breakfast Sandwich and the Matcha Green Tea Latte. The breakfast sandwich was crazy good! I'm not a vegan so I was a little skeptical of the tofu egg, \"bacon\" and \"cheese\", but it was absolutely delicious! There is also a sauce that is a little spicy which completes this sandwich. I also love that they use real matcha as many places don't and I can get  it unsweetened, which a lot of people think is crazy.

The only downfall is the cost. It's $16.83 for a breakfast sandwich and latte. To me, that's a bit expensive. This is a place I'll come back to splurge every now and again, though. The food and I cannot forget the service is that good!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have myself believing that a tsoynami is not bad for me. Please do not feel obligated to comment otherwise. Anybody. Thanks."}
{"text":"I think ice cream is pretty disastrous, so when I tried the tsoynami, I was in frozen dessert heaven.  I've only tried the fruit blend versions, and crave them regularly.  They're good.  And they're big.  My daughter and I are easily satisfied sharing one.

I'm not a coffee drinker, but do enjoy a good chai latte now and then.  This, by far, is the best chai latte in town.  It's got a fairly descent spice (and I love the spice), and I can actually taste the ginger.  And of course, no dairy.

On the down side, my mom loves her dose of half n half in her coffee.  The non-dairy options just didn't satisfy her one bit.  I would imagine that most of my dairy loving friends might be reluctant to join me there.  Oh well.

P.S. Thanks for the doggie-patio love.  She loves riding over with me."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend and we ordered a big size iced mocha only to be disappointed. The cup size itself is very small compared to the price I paid. The cup was also filled with ice which made the quantity of the drink even smaller. Hoping to maybe get a possible refill due to over amount of ice, the employee told me that that was there usual quantity. The drink tasted fine, but for the price it is extremely over priced. It's hard to see myself comeback here."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place while I was visiting Phoenix since all the Yelp reviews gave them 5 stars! I can see why!!!! I had asked the cashier to recommend me a flavor for their T'soynami, as I have never heard of anything like this before. She suggested the vegan nami. I was unsure at first because I am by far not even close to a vegan... more like a carnivore! I went with her suggestion anyway. The vegan nami is so delicious! I would go back there again and again if I am ever in town again! Vacationing and decided to stop here to kill time because of the rave reviews! I'm so glad I did!!!"}
{"text":"Went in there today for the hundredth time. I ordered a cupcake that is the vegan equivalent of a chocolate hostess cupcake. Amazing! They also have great coffee drinks, other pastries and vegan blizzards. Yum! On the occasional Sunday I will take friends to their brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan sweets! Love their Sunday brunch! Highly recommend.  

Note: it does get loud and overrun by hipsters, but the food is still well worth it."}
{"text":"This is the best place to grab something healthy & sweet! The best part is that it's all vegan! I'm vegetarian and hope to one day become vegan. Nami, you make that dream seem a bit more achievable since everything is so good!"}
{"text":"If you want a creative, delicious, thoughtful, good for the earth meal VISIT NAMI!!! We are frequent visitors (about once a week, usually Sunday brunch) and every visit has been memorable. We have ordered the biscuits and gravy, the big ol burrito, the donuts, the cupcakes, the Benedict as a burrito, and the Rodney Dangerfield. Even with a line out the door service is fast, and friendly! 

The restaurant itself is small and intimate. They have indoor and outdoor seating and during brunch seat next door at Green. 

The pastry case is always full of delicious, colorful, and (of course) always vegan treats. You won't be able to help yourself but to order one (or 5). 
The donuts are dense and sweet and always come in creative flavors that put any other donut (vegan or not) to shame. 

You DO NOT HAVE TO BE VEGAN to eat here. I promise that the food you enjoy at Nami is tastier and better for you and your environment than you can get at any other restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch at Green at some point during Thanksgiving week, which is next door to Nami. We had such a terrible experience at Green, that we were hesitant to go over to Nami (I believe they're owned by the same people). Read through Nami's reviews, and decided to take the plunge anyway.

No regrets at all! It was such a relief, the two ladies working that day were so nice and accommodating. They took the time to explain their tSoynami menu to us, and they didn't rush us.
I ordered the Chai tSoynami, and I believe my husband got the cookies and cream one. We loved it! Portions are huge, but we licked up every last bit. 

I knocked of a star because they are pretty vague about what they put in their tSoynami's. Some of the items seemed too good to be true. Would be nice if they listed detailed ingredients on their menu, since a lot of commercialized \"vegan\" foods tend to be highly processed and, sadly, unhealthier versions of what they imitate. 

Anyhow, we were visiting from LA, and I really wanted to stop by again before we left but we never got to! So sad! Anyway, we're excited to go back next Thanksgiving! 

Thanks Nami !"}
{"text":"Nami is great.  I went there twice during a recent trip to Arizona and would have returned if I was there longer.  It was so difficult to decide which tsoynami to order, as they all sounded amazing.  I ended up trying the Rocky Road and the Fluffernutterin'.  Both were delicious.  My only (small) complaint was that the soft serve was a bit icy.  I also tried a couple of their baked good (wish I could have tried more) and was very happy with both - the cookie dough cupcake and the cookie layer cake.  Both were moist and chocolatey with amazing frosting.  If you are vegan in the Phoenix area, go to Nami!"}
{"text":"Great place for that sweet craving . Great environment . I would suggest adding more staff for help being this is such a busy place . Parking isn't convenient"}
{"text":"This is an adorable shop with an awesome vibe. The coffee and soft serve is all delicious and I cannot say enough about the food! I got a McBagel and my boyfriend got biscuits and gravy. We shared each other's because we couldn't decide which we liked more! And then I got a Samoan (like the Girl Scout cookie but in large bar form) to go. Go here, get everything, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nami makes incredible food and sweets! I am originally from the Bay Area and I will be so sad to move back after school simply because there is no Nami back home. They're my go to place for vegan breakfast/brunch and I would recommend them to EVERYONE"}
{"text":"Great little coffee stop with delicious vegan pastries.
Staff were friendly and atmosphere was laid back."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan goodies that taste as good as the \"real\" (i.e., \"conventional\") thing.  Service has always been very friendly and the establishment is immaculate.  The tsoynamis (think healthier version of McBlizzards and yes, that is the correct spelling) are so good; on my most recent visit, I got the Dough Boy, which was chock full of chocolate chip cookie dough.  I also bought a maple glazed doughnut (I would eat the glaze by the spoonful!) which was consumed far, far too quickly.  On another recent visit, I enjoyed an oatmeal creme pie (a sandwich cookie with yummy buttercream) and a chocolate cake doughnut.  Everything I've ever had from Nami has been fresh and fantastic.  Bonus: I can tell myself that everything I eat here is healthy and good for you, because VEGAN.  ;)"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile, cause I drive from the far East Valley.  Used to be my go to when I was on this side of town and would normally have good service.  Unfortunately today was not a good experience. We ordered two coffees and two doughnuts, simple order. I waited forever to get my order. Everyone behind me in line that ordered, got theirs and left. I noticed they made all the Tsoynamis all at once, no matter what time you ordered them. Leaving all the simple orders at the end, even though I was first to order. I had to ask if they forgot me, since I was the last man standing. They said no, we're making your drinks now. They asked if I already got my pastries, I told them that I haven't received anything from them and I waited the longest.
Not one sorry...no apologies, nada. Where has the customer service gone.... As business owners I understand that you're only as good as your product and especially customer service. Unfortunately they failed in customer service today. I believe their system is flawed, hopefully they're having an off day. One customer told me that this was the longest wait he's ever experienced and he had just ordered a simple plain iced coffee, he got his order right before mine, after he had to remind them of it. Was going to give them 2 stars for today's experience, but thought that may be a bit harsh."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with the PB&J tSoynami. Never had tried Vegan soft serve... I would get this again though"}
{"text":"Great product.  Hate the wait. Never less than 20 min for a to go order. 

Next visit, called the order in, no change. Still had the wait. Maybe a separate line for pick ups?  The indifference of the \"Cenpho hipsters\" working the counter is old & tired.  Really, really great product though & I will continue to patronize despite the pain of the visit."}
{"text":"I only have one complaint about nami. If you order brunch togo, they have no system to handle it and you can end up waiting in line for your pick up for about 10 minutes. Other than that, everything is phenomenal. Their pastries, great. Their coffee bar, great. The soy-namis, are a vegan blizzard alternative that are way better imo. If you are vegan or vegetarian this is a must, and soon to be your regular spot. Please come up with a system to continually call out for your to go people though, thanks!"}
{"text":"Vegan blizzards! Their tsyonamis are consistently good and you won't miss the dairy. I especially enjoy the cookie dough one, so much that I haven't tried too many others. The staff is always friendly and they even offered to split our tsyonami so my husband and I could share."}
{"text":"I'm a three or four per week Tsoynami addict. PB&C, cookies and cream and dougboy are personal favorites. Also try a slice of Vegan cake. Only non-dairy dessert I've found that's as good as a Tsoynami is in Tel Aviv!!"}
{"text":"Call before you come to get donuts. The open at 7 but no donuts were ready and I had to wait 40 mins. Nothing was compensated for my time. I set my alarm just to get up early to be here to send them to someone in Cali. I was a little salty. I could have stayed in the bed. At least they were good."}
{"text":"I just came for the ice cream! Let me tell ya, great ice cream. It appears to be \"just soft serve\", but they take it to a new level. I got rocky road and it was bomb. I'm anxious to try the peanut butter next time. 

I am so happy to have this place just a bike ride away from my home."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to dine - - - - finally tried breakfast - had biscuits and gravy - - - I've had tufu scramble before, but this one was very dry and tasteless ..grave had great tast, but needed to cover dry biscuits - - - good health should also be tasteful - - - but I still love them"}
{"text":"Met 3 friends here for what I thought was supposed to be coffee but turned out it was supposed to be lunch. Fitting that I came in confused, because the menu here is the most confusing I've ever seen. Chalkboard, display items, a few specials hand written on signs, and a print menu hidden behind the cash register so we didn't find it until we had waited in line and tried to make our choices from the scribbled notes. They would do well to have one readily available printed menu with all offerings. So we had 2 GF folks and they got the zebra donut and loved it. I got a bagel with herb cream cheese and it was yum. Later we saw the table next to us eating grits and it looked so good we ordered one to share. Very tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Great for those who are lactose intolerant. Delicious ice cream with many options. I wish they had more locations"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick latte + work session and Nami turned out to be a great choice. Delicious iced latte served up by a friendly team in a cute shop. 

I may have missed an opportunity by not trying one of their desserts while I was there. It seemed as if every other patron was stopping by for some ice-cream-in-a-cup-with-stuff-on-it gloriousness, but I stuck it out with coffee. Sigh. At least the coffee was on point."}
{"text":"Good burritos, good coffee and bomb donuts. The wait was a little bit longer than anticipated,but nonetheless great place to stop.  We will definitely be stopping by again when we're traveling through Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I drive over 30min to come here. It's so worth it' The best vegan cookie dough ice cream!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! Everything is fresh and has a lot of flavor! I'm in sweet heaven. Definitely place I'll be coming back to on my cheat days.."}
{"text":"I wish my recent business trip to Phoenix had been longer as I'd have had the opportunity to make more than one visit to Nami.  I arrived near closing time, after dining at Green, and picked up a couple of truffles.  They rocked my world.  I will definitely be back the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best soft serve I've ever had and practically guilt free since it's soy based. It has the consistency and satisfaction of ice cream. The size is also very generous, meaning more for me! Really, how much better can it get? I have no complaints.

Met the owner, Damon, while I was there. What a down to earth and cool guy.

Please come to LA! We need you!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost a year. I'd say this is EXACTLY vegans version of McDonald's."}
{"text":"I have been here 6 times now and on a full half of the occasions I waited in line and was told that they would not serve me. \"We closed the register\" is what they consistently say, though the doors remain open. Call it what you will, but at the least it's really bad customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try the tsoynamis and it was great until I got half way through and found a small hair in it! Grossed me out!!!"}
{"text":"YUM! YUM! YUM!
Amazing healthy choices for those that care.
Rare selections of ice cream, fro-yo, coffee, teas, and more.
A true treat! Enjoy."}
{"text":"The Samoa pastry was delicious. The ice cream was also pretty good but would definitely recommend the pastries if you haven't had them before."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, but I went with a vegan friend to Nami. Boy was it delicious! I had their quiche, and I have to say it was the best quiche I've ever had."}
{"text":"I ordered a tSoynami and really enjoyed it. They have a great selection of creations that you can order from. The only problem I run into here is that this place can be tight squeeze and your order can take awhile on busy nights."}
{"text":"Nami recently did our wedding cake and a variety of pies for our April 2013 wedding. We had a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting for our cake and 10 fruit/pecan pies. They were all amazing! We had 65 people at our wedding and didn't tell anyone they were vegan. No one would had known otherwise. My husband's mother, who is an amazing cook herself and doesn't dole out compliments lightly, said it was the best pecan pie she had ever had. We did not have many leftovers at the dessert table to say the least. A big thank you to Nami!"}
{"text":"Come for breakfast, but come back for the desserts.  A co-worker of mine and her husband are steadfast vegetarians and fell in love with this place almost as fast as they fell in love with Green next door.  This place is owned and run by the same owners as Green, and the space is small just like its counterpart.  Whereas Green is more of a lunch and dinner spot, Nami is more of a breakfast/dessert spot.  We got here around 10am on a Saturday morning and by the time we sat down, it was packed.  Not surprising given how many vegans and vegetarians live around Downtown.

My co-worker recommended I get the biscuits and gravy.  I saw a couple of cupcakes that caught my eye in the pastry case (cookie dough cupcake and red velvet cupcake) so I got those and an OJ too.  As with Green, you order at the counter and seat yourselves.  Total for all of my food was $20.  Food came out to us in less than 10 minutes.  Let me first go into the cupcakes.  I've had vegan cupcakes before at Treehouse Bakery just west of here, and these were equally delicious.  The frosting on both was dense, but creamy and decadent.  The cake itself was actually more dense than Treehouse's which made eating two pretty tough, but it was worth it.  As for the biscuits and gravy, I actually loved the tofu eggs as they put enough spice and herbs on those to make me forget I was eating tofu.  It didn't have the texture of an egg at all, but it was still great.  The home fries were also tasty and crispy and light.  As for the biscuits and gravy itself, mixed reactions on this one.  There was a lot of onion on my gravy which seemed to be a little bit of overkill.  The biscuits were also a little dry.  It was okay, but I think Bragg's Diner (also just west of here) does the vegan biscuits and gravy thing a little better.

All in all though, I was pleased with my first trip here.  The vibe is super relaxed, the gals behind the counter are super friendly, and the portions of food on every dish I saw were plenty hearty.  Even though the food is all vegan, I can assure you that no one leaves here hungry.  I can't totally recommend the biscuits and gravy for breakfast, but I fully intend to explore other breakfast menu items in the future.  I've also heard a lot of good things about the tsoynamis, so that'll be on my to do list.  Just be warned, once you take one look at that pastry display case, its pretty much impossible not to order one."}
{"text":"Tsoynamis are amazeballs- even if you are accustomed to good old, fully-leaded ice cream treats! :)"}
{"text":"Damn....  Just go there, go there now!!  I had the breakfast burrito, amazing!!  Got to chat with some of the staff members, everybody was super nice."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprising.  They serve Royal (@ the Market), for those interested.

Being pretty hip to the coffee scene in PHX, I was a little surprised to hear of this new shop, having not heard of it's coming.  Maybe I didn't look around enough, but it felt like Nami just kind of popped up.

So I had my doubts, as I always will when giving a new place a shot.  The layout was pleasant, and the decor pretty rad; love the couch.  Parking seems sorted out a great deal better than when That's A Wrap inhabited the area -  good plus there.  Sweets looked great.

So I order my typical - drip and a 2x (on the side).  This gives me a general idea of the shop; milk drinks are for second and beyond trips.  Firstly, their demi-tasses are super cute.  Obviously hand-made, and hopefully local.  Loved it.  My drip actually turned out to be a pour-over, which is a plus to me.  A coffee junkie can appreciate a pour-over, where it kind of scares a person just wanting some \"coffee\" (see: I understand why you call it drip vs pour-over).

Straight up espresso is generally a quick way of determining bad-average-good.  Crema was nice though, consistent, and had me thinking I might have a decent thing here.  Taste was good, creamy and quite chocolatey (which seems the profile of the beans being used - the drip was reminiscent of the same).  Said and done (from a 'snob' standpoint), the espresso was good, not mindblowing.  I think the grind was right, but either the dosing could be moved up a tiny bit, or tamped a little harder.  Granted, this was the first and only I had there, so I can't necessarily base the entire shop on that one dopio.  All in all, I'm saying it was good, and while the extraction time was right, it could use a little more density.

The drip (see: pour-over) clearly used the same roast, which isn't a complaint.  The same chocolatey, creamy notes were abound.  I feel the dosing was very light, and should have either been a 12oz, or more grounds used.  I actually felt I was drinking a water heavy coffee.  Not terrible, but certainly not great.  I have a sneaking suspicion if the measurement was a bit closer, it would have been a much better brew.  Pour-overs are an art first, for sure, then a science.  I think they have potential here.  Maybe a better pot would help with this brew method as well.


-- I'll be back.  My experience was neither mind-blowing nor off-putting.  I'm hoping after they get into the swing of things and get the kinks ironed out, this will be one of the cooler stops in PHX.  Certainly a great concept and whatnot."}
{"text":"Four stars because the staff is nice, the menu is fun, and the food is good BUT, nowhere is perfect. 

So, yes, it's not cheap. But consider what everything is made of before being a baby. Everything is delicious, everything is vegan, and a great deal of it is organic.

The Tsoynamis are a blast and the soft serve is perfect. The breakfast burritos are great, the cake is always dense and flavorful, and I can't wait to try the donuts.

Some things are GENUINELY overpriced, however, but hey. Trial and error. I love Nami and I like to try something new every time I go."}
{"text":"Great place for vegan delight! 

If your looking for a vegan friendly coffee / dessert spot in CenPho, I can think of none better than Nami. I came here for the Tsoynami (a vegan friendly dq blizzard) and was not dissapointed. While I don't think you can ever really compare apples to apples when it comes to dairy desserts and non dairy alternatives, it's about as close as you will find. (I wonder if they have one with apples? probably not). I don't think I will ever really find a replacement for my froyo love.

I can't attest for how healthy they are; I imagine the fat content is fairly low, since it is soy based. For those carb / sugar conscious - the ingredients info isn't really posted anywhere, but I imagine there is a fair amount of sugar in whatever toppings, cookies, and candies that go into your frozen dessert. Just do a couple extra sit-ups, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Tsoynamis are my new obsession. They're SO good -- I wouldn't miss ice cream at all if I was a vegan and only had these. I would still pick these any day to save on calories and fat. It's a great dessert stop after going to Green next door (also yummy!)."}
{"text":"Nami is super hip and cute when you walk in ans the store is very quaint and creative. They don't have too many gluten free options everyday but they have enough to definitely stop by. There ice cream is homemade and there are tons of options in that realm. I got the rocky road and the homemade marshmallows were creamy and tasted really fresh. The entire dessert was very refreshing. I usually don't like cheesecake but I tried the gluten free one and it was delicious. This place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I love ice cream! I have loved ice cream since I was old enough to taste food. When I decided to change my diet to plant based I wasn't sure if I would be able to enjoy ice cream. This place make my dreams come true. I forget it's not made out of dairy. All I know is that it is delicious. Many different varieties for everyone to enjoy copies, pastries, and some simple menu items. I go to Green next door and come here for ice cream afterwards."}
{"text":"a MUST GO! I had the brunch special of Texas French toast with tempeh bacon, peanut butter, rasped drizzle and a scramble and hash and it was amazing! My friend had a breakfast burrito and it was huge and delicious as well. Not a lot of places to sit or tables but still worth it. No doubt I'll be back multiple times. Super creative menu"}
{"text":"Awesome for gluten free! Ice cream creations, donuts, cheesecake, granola, cookie dough, etc. We don't live in the area but they let me know they do special orders and catering. They also have a lot of vegan options if that's something you need."}
{"text":"Such yummy vegan treats. Great to have a place where you can order anything and its vegan. The cupcakes are great. Someone bought me a dozen for my birthday and everyone loved them, even the meat eaters. There's one that looks and tastes like a hoho. If your lucky enough to see one in the case, get it. The soynami is out of this world. Think of a dairy queen blizzard made with soy milk and no chemical junk. Soooooo good. Prepare to wait and to stand in line. It's a popular place and some things e made to order. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is right by work so it is a regular stop. Staff is friendly and service is fast. In the summer the tsoynami is a yummy treat, especially the rocky road. The rest of the year I treat myself to a latte or an Italian soda and a sweet treat like a cupcake or other pastry.

Try the strawberry agave Italian soda....delicious!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute coffee shop. My husband, two children, and I went for Sunday morning coffee and doughnuts. I ordered the Cactus Haboob and my husband ordered a Dirty Chai Latte. We also ordered Blueberry Coconut and White Chocolate/Dark Chocolate doughnuts. The coffee and doughnuts were awesome! I don't usually go downtown Phoenix, but this little excursion felt like a touristy getaway for the morning. It will take a little time for the baristas to get your order to you when there is actually a line out the door, but that didn't bother us. I highly recommend everyone to try this place out."}
{"text":"He menus is really cool and the quality is awesome you can't believe there is no dairy in it! It taste good! I would come back here! I haven't tried the pastry yet but it's on the list! The atmosphere is really cool and casual and awesome to hang out with couple of friends or bringing your date!"}
{"text":"Came here a while back with a friend and it was definitely worth the drive! Parking  was a bit tight since it's a pretty small place. I can't remember the exact flavor of my tsoynami, something with bananas, but it was so, so good. I also got a quiche to go and that was delicious as well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for breakfast if you're looking for a weekly routine, but this place has one of the most fun brunches I've had in a long time. My brunch companion is very much NOT a vegan, but loved everything we got on the menu (including the blueberry maple glazed vegan donut)! Good addition to the choices on 7th St. in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Green for seven years, so when the building for Nami was purchased fairly recently, I was excited to see what they would do with it! Their vegan soft serve has always been incredible and you can get it at both of the Green restaurants, but what I love about Nami is that they have A LOT of different baked goods and beverages! I no longer live in Arizona, so when I visit family, I always have to stop by to purchase a box of treats. Their Yankee Doodles are amazing, as well as everything else I've ever had there. The parking is atrocious and you're better off parking elsewhere and just walking to the restaurant if you plan on sitting and not just sending someone in the pick something up for you."}
{"text":"A good friend always raves about this place so I decided to meet her there for a dessert & chat this afternoon. The Coffee Coco Loco tSoynami was just OK. Cappuccino was average. Conversation with a good friend is what made this visit special. 2 Stars and nothing more. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Favorite brunch spot ever! If you're into something spicy try the Chiliquiles! SO GOOD!! Then when you want dessert try their Tsoynami. So good you won't miss dairy. Kudos NAMI and Green- excellent food."}
{"text":"After school delight with my daughter. Our 1st time here. We loved it! Delicious and a GREAT staff! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the product, but it takes so long to get your order that I've been late getting back to work."}
{"text":"Good lord these folks were super happy to be serving up vegan treats. Always good when a 5YO doesn't want to share his \"ice cream.\""}
{"text":"Really yummy . I haven't been here in over a year since moving out of town and I was craving some of their delicious vegan ice cream. The place is exactly the same with some new faces . The serving size seems smaller and my better finger was lacking Chico sticks but was great none the less. Still the same Nami I remember :-) 

Great for an adventurous date or little snack downtown."}
{"text":"I cannot rave enough about this place - the environment, the people, but specifically, those tsoynami's. As a dairy free lady living in this city, Nami is everything I could ask for when it comes to desserts! I'm a local at Nami, and you know it's bad when they know your name at the order stand. I cannot get enough of their cookie dough, also."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends, the staff was all really nice, super cool hip spot with awesome vegan stuff, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! The fluffernutterin' and churro donuts are my favorite. Friendly staff, awesome food/drinks; I just wish there were more locations!"}
{"text":"Other than the limited seating, I have nothing but good things to say about this place.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. Treated sons to soy based soft serve. Both loved it and oldest couldn't tell difference from reg. Daughter loved the raspberry donut. The menu board could be more reader friendly, especially for newbies to nami. Parking is very limited. Maybe because it was very busy but felt the staff could have been more helpful with questions.  Will go again when in area."}
{"text":"This bakery was delicious!! I wish they had an east valley location! They have amazing food for health-conscious folks like me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple coffee drinks around noon, on a week day. Only 2 other people in the place. The cashier didn't even say hello or make eye contact. I felt like I was bothering her. The latte I received was not good, my husbands drink was though. I wanted to see what kind of food/snacks they had, but in reality I'll probably never be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but it's seriously overpriced. The people who work there are nice but the decor is minimal. I really hate that vegan/vegetarian food is always crazy expensive. I liked this place but it's not nice enough to go here for a special occasion, so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"best vegan donuts in AZ! and the nami mc muffin sandwich is equally amazing. love this place, the food is always exceptional and the staff is really nice as well. i would recommend, and say its a must if you live here  or are traveling through phoenix."}
{"text":"Nami never disappoints, delicious breakfast meals and amazing unique deserts! I'm going to use them for our wedding cake and cupcakes, all my non vegan friends love it too!"}
{"text":"If you want delicious (and vegan) treats, including the best soft serve around - come enjoy a frozen tsoynami blended tsoft serve, a donut or amazing weekend brunch. We love the betterfinger .....ymmm!"}
{"text":"I have converted from vegetarian to veganism since the time of my original review. Now I love Nami even more!

Favourite tsoynamis: PB & J, Banana Cream Pie, Lemonbar (when they have it!) and also the Funny Bunny that was around briefly in the spring. 

If you follow them on Facebook or Instagram you can be lured to come in by their yummy photos, which happens to me on a regular basis. 

I often meet non-vegan friends here and they've all loved it as well."}
{"text":"I was first referred to Nami (and Green!) when I moved out to Phoenix through a very friendly vegan. Coming from Chicago, I fully expected to find fewer quality vegan options in the city of Phoenix. After my first visit to Nami, I was clearly proven WRONG. From the delicious vegan donuts to the surprisingly tasty orange juice-espresso drink, to the infamous Sunday Nami brunch, I fell in love. 

But my favorite part? Their soynami, which is a guilt-free version of a McFlurry; a vegan's dream in a cup of yum. I've even taken my S.O., an avid meat eater, to try their breakfast burritos. It's his new favorite breakfast spot. Vegans and meat eaters alike, rejoice! 

The staff is always so friendly and even recognizes their regulars. The owner is a passionate, dedicated vegan man who understands what a passion for animals really is. 

If you're looking for a healthy, environmentally-conscious meal that tickles your tastebuds, look no further. Nami is your next stop."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place! Great healthy way to start your day! Breakfast burrito is awesome.  Enjoy a great cappuccino as well. I love their vegan ice creams!"}
{"text":"This weird place serves both Vietnamese and Neo-Japanese cuisine. The combination of cuisine is weird, no lie, but the service and the fact the restaurant was clean, well lit and well decorated gives it an edge.

I ordered a Large bowl of pho, with a beef, and chicken salad to share. The pho was alright, however, it was not hot enough and lacked a tad of complexity that should be brought up by the spice mix that goes into the soup. The salads were ok, the chicken salad was heavily peppered and the beef salad could have been a tad spicier. Ok place if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"So glad that I found this place. Caters to my no dairy and gluten-free life and even does it while tasting amazing! 
The coffee is hot and food is so amazing you'd never know there is anything missing."}
{"text":"Nami was my first and last stop on my weeklong Arizona trip. I came here for the Cactus Haboob and a vegan donut to get me going on the road to Tucson. When I came back to Phoenix, I got a tsoynami. It was packed that evening and I sat next to another traveler. I loved the tsoynami and the staff so much that I came back before I left for a tsoynami at 10am. They'll serve them to you any time of the day. They have fun combinations or you can make your own - it's a vegan \"Blizzard.\" I wanted everything in their bakery case and I'm pretty picky with my fresh baked desserts. I wish we had this in LA."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but the place is small and they did not have that great of a variety when I went there for breakfast. Their granola is great but acai bowl was ok..not too tasty."}
{"text":"For those with allergies or food sensitivities, Nami is a great place to go to! I had the tsoynami with a friend as a treat, and it was so good. I had the Coffee Coco Loco tsoynami, which came with chocolate, coffee, and little pieces of crispy rice. My friend had the Almond Oy Vey, which came with coconut flakes, chocolate syrup, and almond silvers. Keep in mind that both of these \"ice cream\" were gluten free and dairy free, and it was amazing how good it tasted! The tsoynamis were a bit lighter and icier than their traditional heavier icecream counterparts, but I liked it better the tsoynami way. 

Nami also has quiche, pastries, shakes, yogurt parfaits, gluten free donuts, as well as vegan donuts and brunch on select days. 

Will be definitely going back to try their gluten free donuts and their parfaits before work, and definitely will be back for some tsoynami treats - I'll post pictures! In a happy food coma right now... Highly recommended."}
{"text":"All I can say is this coffee/ice cream/sweet shop is inspirational!  Coupled with it's parent restaurant in the same parking lot, you are certainly in for a great night of eats!

All of my experiences have been nothing short of amazing.  I have eaten at Nami for breakfast, desert after lunch, desert after dinner and for a mid-day snacks.

The coffee is all vegan and fair trade and they offer all kinds of milks to add in with your lattes and such.  Packaging for the coffee is also awesome.  For breakfast, you can opt for some power vegan bars sitting on the counter, quiche or search through the sweets display case.  For deserts, my favorite is the cupcake which was inspired with the Hostess cake but it's vegan!  That's right... chocolaty-goodness with white cream filing and icing on top! oh my!  They also have a chai cupcake which has a cinnamon-like icing on top... yum yum!  They have snicker doodles with icing sandwiched in between and mini-cookies to scarf down.  Everything is vegan!  They are famous for something known as a soy-nami but I've never made it to the vegan ice cream!  I'm always opting for the aforementioned sweets!  If I ever get to one, I will review again... They also do sundaes and live music on Sunday nights.

For dinner, walk across the parking lot to Green Pastures.  See my review for this restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Great for brunch, good coffee! Fast and friendly service! The wings are awesome, and even if you are not a vegetarian you will like this place!"}
{"text":"This place is good for a ice cream with a lot of stuff in it. I'm more of a simple person. My girlfriend on the other hand loves to mix everything up. Parking sucks."}
{"text":"food is amazing. customer service is amazing.
parking is a pain in the ass. they have the most amazing vegan ice cream & treats ever"}
{"text":"Nami and Green are the best vegan places to go in Phoenix.  My wife and I go regularly but we got married a few months ago and Morgan at Nami made our wedding cake.  It couldn't have been more perfect!  Morgan also arranged for breakfast and lunch on our wedding day to be made for us and our wedding party.  Morgan had made everything perfect and got things delivered and looking perfect for us.  Would definitely have them cater and have her make another cake for a different occasion.  They set up a taste testing day for us and worked great with us.  Everyone loved the cake and how creative it was.  Love this place."}
{"text":"We went here three times on our vacation. Twice for breakfast and once for their mint tsoynami. My husband loved their pour over coffee. It isn't instant coffee so you need a tiny bit of patience and it's totally worth it. we got breakfast burritos each time and the second time I was feeling like I probably shouldn't do a burrito again and vocalized it and the lady at the counter suggested I do it as a plate-- Not on the menu (that I noticed) and super nice of her. I did and I had no regrets. Their chocolate doughnut was out of this world. Definitely coming back for multiple trips next time I visit family in AZ."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Their deserts and coffee are so bomb. It's a bit small and a bit pricey, but soooo worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Absolutely amazing!  Great breakfast and sweets!  AND YES!  it's VEGAN!"}
{"text":"Great little place! Nice to see something different like this in Arizona. The sister restaurant next door is excellent.

Had a soy-ft serve sundae, awesome. Had an iced coffee, so delighted by all the options for vegan-friendly milk (soy, almond, rice, etc). 

Great place, good luck!

1 thing - the wood spoons, while I'm sure are biodegradable and all, have a weird texture with the ice cream (at least for me). I think those spoons just kind of freak me out. I didn't ask for plastic or metal, I'm sure they would have accommodated."}
{"text":"Nami is the place to go when you are looking for a yummy treat (vegan or not)! The doughboy tsoynami is my favorite and a close second is the NO's n Mint. You cant go wrong with any tsoynami flavor honestly. I would pretty much recommend everything, other than the peanut butter bar thing they sell at the front and the baked chocolate chip cookies, which I have found to be a little hard and dry. The staff are always super friendly and helpful, and the whole place is super chill. Sometimes its a little busy, but the line usually moves  quickly, and the wait time to get your yummy treat is not long at all. I have taken my non vegan friends here and everyone loves it too! Honestly I cant get enough!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the past month and i have to say: THIS PLACE IS DA BOMB! I'm not personally vegan, and this place still holds a sweet spot in my heart. My only problem, sometimes it can smell a bit like a gym inside, but there's chairs outside so problem solved. Check this place out if you're looking for some good dessert."}
{"text":"Tsoynamis are one of my favorite foods in the world. I'm lactose intolerant and love blizzards, so it's a match made in heaven. I go to Green a lot as I live nearby, and have never felt unwelcome there, so I had no reason to think I'd feel that way about their sister joint, Nami. So after a disappointing dinner at Nobou at Teeter House in downtown phx, bf and I were excited to turn our night around with dessert at Nami when we realized we were super close to it and it was still open (since Green would have been closed by the time we got there). Their hours posted indicate they close at 9:30pm on Fridays, and we arrived at 9:20 after calling to confirm they were still open. 

We walked in, and there were a few groups of people sitting and leisurely enjoying their ice cream and baked goods. We walked up to the counter and bf knew what he wanted right away (s'mores tsoynami with pb added...SO good!). I, on the other hand, needed a minute to decide since they had a huge bakery case filled with things I never see at Green and wanted to try out, in addition to the full tsoynami menu. 

I asked a few questions, which the light-haired woman working there was happy to answer. She disappeared to make bf's tsoynami, though, and we were then met with an icy stare and complete annoyance by the dark-haired woman working there. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, and hey, it's Friday night and she probably wanted to close up so she could go out. But it wasn't even 9:30, and she had zero interest in making this customer happy. 

I said I was debating between a cookie and a tsoynami, while she rolled her eyes and continued to tap her fingers on the counter. Her response, rather than a suggestion or recommendation for something to order, was, \"We close in five minutes.\" Ok? I know that already? Why wouldn't you just try to hurry us along in a constructive way, rather than making me feel afraid to ask you any questions about your products?

She continued to sigh and look around, willing us to disappear, and honestly I wish we would have left right then. But we were starving, and I really wanted to enjoy one of their delicious looking treats. I decided in my head that I wanted a tsoynami, but I was way too afraid to have that lady actually prepare something for me as I was pretty sure she would spit in it, in addition to the length of time it would have taken to prepare which surely would have put us over her 5-minute limit. I said I'd take the cookie, to get us out of there sooner. We still had to wait another minute for bf's tsoynami to be finished, and felt her stare us down the whole time. Mind you, there are still parties of other customers at tables still lingering. We were definitely NOT responsible for keeping them open, but we sure were made to feel that way!

I don't care how tasty your treats are, I would never EVER go back there...who wants to leave a dessert place with such a sour taste in their mouth? I will be getting all of my future tsoynamis at Green, where they never make me feel like I'm doing something wrong by asking questions or spending a minute debating between a few items."}
{"text":"A cute small place with delicious treats! So worth the late night snack :p 

It's one of the unique places in phx"}
{"text":"Super delicious late night indulgence. We have tsunami banana ice cream and a coconut haystack type of cookie dessert. Both fabulous. When we walked it (we are from out of town) there was no one else there so we were a little worried. We must have hit it just right because it was about 8pm on a Wednesday night. Within 5 minutes of placing our order, the place got super busy. While we ate, it cleared out and filled up again. Everyone seemed to be pretty regular. Nice clean restroom out back - very friendly staff working. If I had any suggestions it would be to have a space planner come in and help figure out better seating. The wall seating was fine but a little awkward because of table placement. People might hang out a little more if the seating was better. We will be back!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets--great tasting, cruelty-free breakfasts, treats and desserts!

Love the people and the food.

Come, eat, experience joy:-)"}
{"text":"Food was great! Staff was very kind. However I did not see any lizards so I give this a 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"I only came back here to meet a friend for breakfast. It was so disgusting. I ordered a green tea latte, they gave me a green tea (made with with a teabag) topped with some foam. Not a real matcha green tea like you get anywhere else. I sent it back. The breakfast plate I had (something hasheesh) looked like it was made by a 10 year old child. In fact, a child would have done a better job. The tofu scramble was dry as were the \"hash\" potatoes. The \"sausage\" was some nasty soy thing topped with that nasty Daiya fake cheese sitting in a puddle of grease.

Do yourself a favor and head over to Loving Hut if you want good and healthy vegan food. Nami is yet another overpriced, trendy disappointment in central Phoenix operated by people who have no clue about good food."}
{"text":"Wowzers! An unpretentious, quality restaurant serving some delicious food. I showed up 30 minutes before brunch and figured that was the way to go. I ordered the tres leche frech toast and the \"buffalo wings.\" The tres leche french toast was phenomenl. I wanted to pick up the [late and lick it clean. The sauce was what really made the meal and I couldnt believe it was vegan! The buffalo wings hit the spot with that specific flavor. They also had a nice texture against the teeth. One thing I will say is parking is ATROCIOUS and lines can be just as bad. With some patience, it's definitely worth coming here. I wanted dessert, but I had a big day ahead of me and could not ruin my appetite."}
{"text":"I come here perhaps more often that I should. Tsoynamis are my downfall *queue up Price is Right fail horn*. But then again, its better than blubbering over to Dairy Queen and crying inside an M&M Blizzard of shame.

Inside this hopping hub inspired by the geniuses of Green is part bakery, part ice cream shop, and part coffe haus....sprinkled with brunch awesomeness in the morning and on weekends. This is my go-to spot for any sweet treat, because as my friends know I do not eat crap. I am now on primarily a low-calorie, low carb, primarily vegan/fish based diet. I watch what I eat and work out regularly.

How does Nami fit in? After a stressful day, instead of grabbing 5 beers and nachos, or a heaping 3 scoop fatty ice cream, I come here. I grab a 100% soy-based ice cream treat called a Tsoynami, which comes with dozens of variations made up by Nami. My personal favorite is The Doughboy, with vanilla soy soft serve and 100% organic chocolate chip cookie dough. Horrible for you? Meh, not great by any means. Better than Coldstone. Actually, you could probably have two Tsoynamis and be still way better off than anything Coldstone, Baskin Robbins, or Dairy Queen has to offer. 

They also have a very high quality coffee bar which provides basic coffee fair, along with a dizzying arrangement of baked goods all vegan friendly. The vegan doughnuts blow my mind. I have yet to dance the doughnut dance at Nami, but I can do an eye test and say \"I approve\".  Overall, I can't give this place enough love. It's super trendy, the food on the weekends (look at their menu) are so to die for gang...its delicious. Green is a business genius for concocting the awesomeness that is Nami. They have this man happy, and a customer for life. Enjoy, 5 stars.... for everything they have here. Just go, if you haven't been yet. Just do it already!"}
{"text":"Vegan - check !
Caffeine - check !
Friendly - check ! 

I love this place. Great food, excellent service and then soynami!  I want to dock a star for the interwebs not working but it couldve been a glitch. I sure as heck will be going back once this sun cools off !"}
{"text":"LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE! All Vegan. You have to try their ice cream blizzards! All different flavors, only $5. I got the s'mores and I came back and got the cookie dough too. Both so good! They have vanilla, chocolate or twist. Of course, you don't have to get the blizzard. You could get just get an ice cream cone or cup too. I loved this place so much that I came back yet again for their breakfast! We got the special which was a breakfast pizza. Such big portions! Didn't end up trying any of their sweets but they looked delicious! Also had plenty of gluten free options. They have a very SMALL parking lot. Staff was very friendly. Bathrooms located outside. Only downside was they charge more for almond milk in my house brew coffee. LIKE WHY?! You are an all vegan café. That being said that was my only compliant. Great vegan café!"}
{"text":"I have been to Nami and Green a handful of times and the service is inconsistent. Sometimes you get you order in less then 10 minutes, and other times it takes upwards of 20-30 minutes. The one thing that is consistent is the unfriendliness of the staff. If I was rating the food alone I would give 4 stars but because of the customer service, I give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Trying out a tSoynami should be on everyone's bucket list. These DQ Blizzard-style treats will dispel any preconceived notions about vegan food. My favorite tSoynamis are the Dough Boy and the Rocky Road.

Also, they have amazing donuts--you just have to get there early enough to snag one!

If you know any vegan food haters, get them a tSoynami and watch their pessimism quickly turn into brain freeze.

The only reason I'm giving Nami a 4 stars instead of a 5 is because it seems like they are still figuring out their breakfast/brunch situation. The last time I went in for brunch things seemed a little disorganized and the food wasn't as good as their dessert items."}
{"text":"Sadly their ice cream machine was down the day I visited and they were out of many things, but I knew I couldn't leave without at least trying something! I got a dark chocolate raspberry donut and oh my god was it moist and delicious. I'm not sure if all vegan donuts are just blessed with this ability to be so moist and delicious or I've just been lucky; either way I'm not complaining. I can't wait to go back and actually get a Tsoynami and compare it to J. Selby's Soyclone from home here."}
{"text":"The top vegan cafe to get comfort food in uptown Phoenix. Required eating when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I went here for the first time tonight and got a Mystery Mash Tsoynami.. I love the service, and my treat was deeeeeelicious!! I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I love this vegan dessert place. The banana cream tsoynami was great. But I think the whipped cream is made with coconut milk, which I hate. There wasn't too much of it and the ice cream itself had a really nice texture, so I ignored the whipped cream. 
The chai tsoynami had excellent flavors and some type of crunchy graham crackers mixed inside. So yummy!
The white chocolate raspberry donut, which was also gluten free, was not so good. The flavor was kinda funky and we couldn't finish it. 
I would love to return to try other things next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"By far my favorite vegan desserts. I have been to other vegan bakeries and the pastries taste bland. Nami nailed it! But I wouldn't expect anything less since the Parent Restaurant Green is the most delicious food I've ever had. I wish I lived closer to downtown Phoenix because I would go every weekend. The vibe is always super chill and friendly. Plus you can just pop over to Green and have brunch!"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. I ordered multiple items to try some of their stuff out. And the only thing I was content with was the Italian soda i ordered. The other items were either too strong in a flavor or not strong enough. The ice cream was alright as well. Just wasn't all that for me i guess. And I've had plenty delicious vegan treats to know that vegan treats can be way better then dairy treats. And these did not make that list."}
{"text":"Good donuts and I'm not vegan.  I like all kinds of donuts and these are consistency wise like cake.  Lighter that a buttermilk bar.  They use same donuts with different toppings.  Time we went took 10-16 mins to get drink order. Phone orders slow service down.  So if you like vegan I would say try it for yourself.  For me...probably not coming back."}
{"text":"Great Americanos and lattes. Haven't jumped on their baked good as there is just something off to me about vegan products but I'll leave that stuff to the kids that love it :)

Apparently I need to try their frozen soft-serve thang... Soynami...it's where it's at i keep hearing. 

Great great great job on the renovation of the building and thoughtful material choices and design. A very nice addition to 7th street. Nice to see, said the Phoenix native :)"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even know where to start with this place. My girlfriend and I visited this place after eating at the American vegetarian next door, which had seemed to be connected to this cafe. There were so many vegan options. They had cookies to cupcakes. Their coffees did not look half bad either. Within the 3 days I spent in Phoenix, I found myself here 3 times as well. 
We were so stoked to find vegan biscuits and gravy here. They came with some potato square hash and some tofu scramble which had to be some of the best i have had yet. I also got the country breakfast burrito which was so good as well. The worker was so nice when i had asked for ketchup and had to go in the back to get it for me. 
As for desserts, their soynamis were pretty much a soy soft serve. I was not a huge fan of their chocolate one, so I found myself happier when I ordered just the vanilla with my soynamis. Over the course, I tried the cookie dough one (which was a bit sweet when ordered with swirl), the mint one (which was so fun with the vanilla), and the marshmallow one (which was probably my favorite). The workers here were so nice. The place was so nice. I'm kind of glad I don't live in Phoenix. I would be there way too often and would probably give them all of my money."}
{"text":"You have to try the big ol burrito and there McBegal!! Only downside is the overly priced donuts and pastries.. other then that we love it"}
{"text":"I would probably give this place a solid 3 or 4 just for existing! But, it bothers me greatly that the staff doesn't know what is in the food. When I asked what they use in the lemon bars the response was \"I have no idea\". I came in again with my friend, and we both ordered tsoynami. They made his first, then a bunch of other people- nearly 19 minutes later mine was ready. My friend tried to wait to eat his, but it was melting. So, by the time I had mine- I was eating alone. It really didn't make sense. 

Conclusion- a vegan restaurant should really know what's in the food. Many people adopt this lifestyle because of food allergies and various other concerns. Improve workflow and service. Right now you are below standard, but you have the potential to be great."}
{"text":"I have friends who have been raving about this place, so when we were with them recently, we decided to stop in and try out Nami.  My bf and I were right in the middle of a 30-day vegan challenge and beginning to miss desserts... Bring on the tSoynami! This is a soft serve, soy-based blizzard type of dessert.  They mix in just about anything you can imagine and its all vegan!  I had the cookie dough; bf had the mixed berries.  We got huge portions (I didn't finish mine) and they were both delicious.  They have a great looking pastry case (vegan donuts?!) that I did not indulge in this stop.  I decided I needed an afternoon pick me up, so I got myself a caramel mockiato as I saw they house make their vegan caramel. That caramel was amazing and the soy milk was frothed up to perfection! Wayyy better than anything you've ever had at Starbucks!  I can't imagine any ways to improve... Vegan desserts abound and the tastiest coffee.  Their breakfast and brunch menu looks amazing too.  Next time I'm downtown for breakfast, this place will be in mind!"}
{"text":"Amazing. My only regret is not buying more than one gf donut. Would recommend to anyone with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Great little place. Staff is very friendly. Owner is a hard worker and attentive. My daughter got the yogurt parfait and she loved it. Will come again."}
{"text":"Being a Nutrition fanatic, I decided to incorporate Veganism into my diet (6 days on with 1 cheat day). I went into this place and absolutely everything is vegan so I don't have to worry about modifications. The atmosphere is laid back and cool and so is the staff! Very friendly and unique personalities to be found here.
The coffee is delicious and the food is good as well. I wish there was more to choose from other than only baked goods and quiche, but that won't keep me from becoming a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  When I get downtown I try to eat here.  There is nothing really bad about Nami or Green except parking.   I have never ate anything I disliked there.  They are accommodating to groups of people too.   I hope they expand to the west side or north side of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"So we wanted ice cream, and didn't think this visit would turn into an escapade. Ordered the the peach cobbler ice cream. My friend is deathly allergic to cashews. Little did we know the storemade granola contained cashews which is in the peach cobbler ice cream. When my friend noticed cashews were in her ice cream, she kindly asked the girl working the register if there were cashews, the girl said yes. She informed the cashier that she is severely allergic and to that the cashier said \"oh well we have it posted\" and pointed to a tiny sign in the kitchen. There was no reaction as to the well being of my friend. We looked over the menu again and there was absolutely no warning that there were nuts in the ice cream the only warning was that there may be cross contamination between all food products offered. Will not be visiting as the gals working were very rude and terrible."}
{"text":"I had the caramel macchiato with an herb cream cheese everything schmagel. So delicious. My girls had strawberry and chocolate ice cream respectively, and my sister had the strawberry Italian soda and the plain bagel with organic ham to avoid soy. All four of us were more than satisfied with the service, the treat, and the helpfulness to accommodate a soy allergy! Thanks, Namians!"}
{"text":"A bit of a trek from where we were, but props to this store for being open on labor day weekend. The venue's a little small, the staff a little harried despite the lack of a line and the limited menu items. Despite the wait, we managed to obtain one of each of the cupcakes to try - a little dry, but they were tasty enough that i couldn't believe they were vegan! Would come again if it was closer and/or the wait wasn't so long."}
{"text":"Baked vegan desserts are great, if a bit on the dense side. Their shakes, which are like their version of a vegan McFlurry are dope! The interior has a cool, punk vibe. The only thing that would make them even better was if they offered a few more savory options for folks who want more than just sweets."}
{"text":"i came here for the Sunday brunch in July when my boyfriend visited me. i got the benedict arnold plate and he got wing ding dang plate.

the tofu scramble that comes with every meal tastes only of tumeric. not good. they need to throw some kala namak in there to give it more of an authentic egg flavor. the hash potatoes were okay - they really needed ketchup but no ketchup was to be found.

i tried one of my boyfriend's wings and it was one of the foulest things i have ever tasted. there was way too much vinegar in the sauce. yet, he still somehow loved them. i'm convinced that boy has no taste whatsoever.

i've never had nonvegan hollandaise sauce so i have nothing to compare it to, but the hollandaise sauce that came on my plate just tasted like mustard to me. which, i imagine, is not the way hollandaise is supposed to taste.

despite all this, the donuts are TO DIE FOR. I got a maple bar and ohhhhhh my god! it tasted just like the real deal! 

i don't know WHAT they make their canadian bacon out of, but it is the best dang canadian bacon i have EVER had! it tastes JUST like regular ham! 

on your way out, they also have some refreshing complimentary cucumber water which i really enjoyed. 

i wish i could give this place more stars simply for being an all-vegan restaurant, but the food is either hit or miss. would i come here again? absolutely. but probably just for the amazing donuts and canadian bacon. :^)"}
{"text":"Sunday donuts???? how bout that. after months of clean living, we decided to treat ourselves to a dessert. we remembered Nami from a previous eating out at Green. We swung by and lo and behold...Sundays feature donuts!!!!

the wife had the coffee donut and i had the coconut. both were freaking delicious. truth be told, i thought mine was better. they're not the light donuts like krispy kreme, but more \"doughy\" but not cake-ey like. they taste like donuts ok! delicious donuts. and some are gluten and soy free if you're into that. 

order at the counter, service is quick, efficient. and it was crazy busy from the brunch crowd right before 2pm. parking is tight....best to leave the H3 at home."}
{"text":"Going to nami, I wasn't really sure what to expect. I recently made a lifestyle change of wanting to eat more of a plant based diet for my health so hearing about a vegan dessert place was pretty cool. However, I was not impressed with my experience. It seems as if they try to make up for lack of flavor by dumping pounds of sugar into their desserts. Seriously some of the sweetest things I've ever eaten. Texture of ice cream was okay but the aftertaste was not pleasant. I did like the snickerdoodle cookie but overall I do not see myself returning due to the lack of true flavor and crazy amounts of sugar in their desserts."}
{"text":"Vegan sweets is a real thing people. I'm not even Vegan which means when I tell you this place is nothing short of terrific! I really mean it's absolutely delicious Vegan cream or ice cream whatever you want to call it. I don't care because every bite was amazing. Best thing about living in the hot weather is eating cold things. Vegan up folks because your missing out if you don't. The DOHboy is the Nami take on a Cookie Dough Blizzard without the stomachache later. Thumbs up all the way on these great treats."}
{"text":"I love the food here and it's pretty much one of 3 vegan/vegetarian spots in Phoenix but the service is UNBELIEVABLY slow. I don't even walk in the door if there is a line. Even with no line it took about 20 minutes to get an acai bowl on a Wednesday at 10:40am. Don't ever come here if you're in a hurry, but it's a lovely place to sit and chat a whole morning away with a friend."}
{"text":"This was one of the famous places I wanted to try for dessert in Phoenix.  The place is a vegan soft serve place with lots of other baked goods.  The soft serve had many interesting flavors, I got the chai tiramisu, since it sounded delicious and a great combo of flavors.  The flavor itself was really good and the price was pretty reasonable considering the quality.  It was 5 dollars for a small cup, but pretty good.  There is a small area for parking in the back!"}
{"text":"Nami-you had me at hello!

My sweet tooth is SO thankful this exists and that it is close to my work site (though I'd prefer it was closer to my home-pretty please consider setting up another one in Chandler/Gilbert??? :). I'm a loyal Green customer (no restaurant has topped this restaurant as far as I know, NATIONALLY!!), and Nami is an exciting addition. I haven't gone there for Brunch, but I do plan on very very soon! 

I can't pick a favorite because everything is good there. I like to try a new Tsoynami flavor each time I go there. I love their play on their toppings such as Captain Crunch and how it brings back childhood memories. 

This is a place I would bring my non-vegans to-not one of them has walked away disappointingly."}
{"text":"We went there today to try it out what the hype was all about. Sorry this place is overrated. They make those vegan \"ice cream shakes\" with no love into them whatsoever. They look like someone ate it and it came out of them again. Your eyes eat with!!!  I had to search for my mango and berries that were supposed to be in them.
Vegan gluten free donut also not tasty. It tasted like a cheap packed ready mix. To pricey for what it is.
I love trying new things especially little places, but nope there is better places in and around PHX then this. 
2 Stars only because they are somehow trying to make a \"healthy\" version of a cafe vs a chain."}
{"text":"Cool place. I'm not vegan or a vegetarian and I still enjoy everything. The food is prepared well and very tasty. I like their buffalo \"wings\", a very good spicy. I also had their Carmel mockiato, and have had their cactus haboob coffee. Their cactus haboob is a little bit better for me only because the Carmel drink can be a little too sweet for me sometimes. If you ask for less syrup, it's better for me. Their donuts are delicious! I really liked the guava. Was very dense and tasted like a more natural sweet glaze donut. We both really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"For over a year now I have oogled over pictures of food from Nami and today I went and tried my first tSoynami. My expectations were definitely met! I have been trying to stay away from dairy lately, but sometimes vegan treats just aren't that good. Not the case at Nami!
The location was easy to find, but parking was horrible. I think I parked illegally and almost hit a wall and a few cars trying to get in and out of a spot. But that is my only complaint! The place is smaller than I had anticipated, but it was cute! Not too crowded, but there was a steady flow of people. I liked both the interior and exterior of the restaurant.
At first I was worried because the tsoynamis weren't written on the chalk board, but then I thankfully found a menu. There were so many options! A lot of gluten free choices as well which is so great. I certainly had trouble choosing. Also they had some ready made treats on display which looked tasty. Some kind of coconut donut, yum!
After much deliberation, I settled on the Haystack Attack. I got half chocolate half vanilla. It came with chocolate, gluten free pretzels, rice marshmallow, and a rice cereal. It was very very tasty! Very sweet and I couldn't finish it, but I loved it and would totally come back to try something new. Also now I'm looking at the Sunday brunch pictures and I'm drooling over them.
Another positive, the people working there were nice, didn't seem pretentious, which sometimes people who work at places like that kind of are ha. Very awesome, I recommend!"}
{"text":"Delish espresso drinks, yummy cupcakes, and soy soft serve so good it passes for real soft serve with the pickiest critic - my 4 year old daughter!

Here's the deal - I used to be vegan YEARS ago so I am perhaps more open to places that specialize in vegetarian/vegan.  However, I don't SEEK out vege places anymore because now I am back to eating everything (see my review on the Pork Dip from St. Francis if you're skeptical).

I decided to check this place out because they have a modern vibe to it and all they do is coffee and desserts. I've passed it every Saturday for the past year and have always been drawn in by their clever signage. I had NO idea they were an \"alternative\" cafe until I walked in and checked the menu. 

This place has incredible baked goods and they do a great job with the coffee. That's pretty much all I need to be happy :) For starters, it's hard to find a good espresso spot in Phoenix. Secondly, I remember that with the vegan-restricted diet my general rule of thumb was if I was eating out and the food tasted good - it was probably not vegan. This place has just perfected sweet treats that are gluten and dairy free which just makes me even more impressed with it. 

This is definitely getting bookmarked as my cafe/bakery go-to when I'm in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was fantastic! 100% plant based but never felt deprived at the selection. We started with Sin-a-bun and a vegan GF donut.  (We weren't here to lose weight). Shared 2 plates chilaquiles, vegan huevos rancheros, and side of  southwestern grits.  All were quite good and generous portions. Potatoes were perfect.  Eclectic vibe and solid coffee quality.  Wish I had room to try the biscuits and gravy- maybe next time. Great wait staff and counter service.  Some items were expensive but quality is worth it.  If this is the trend of food, we're going that direction gladly."}
{"text":"Very welcoming and friendly staff. Delicious treats and comfortable environment. This is now a new regular place for us. Can't wait to come back and try everything else they have:)"}
{"text":"Poor customer service and terrible parking! They were \"out\" of items on the menu that they should have! If you're there for pickup, they want you to stand in the long line of people ordering to pick up your food that you already ordered. So inconvenient. They didn't even have the food ready when I got there. They had to prepare it which took 15 mins. When they called me, they didn't have the other stuff I preordered ready either. They didn't even apologize. They made me get back in line and order them. So unprofessional and frustrating! The cashier Amy and the other workers were rude too!"}
{"text":"What a lovely find this was. Located just next to Green, and a block from The Coronado, this makes up a little vegan mecca in central Phoenix. I came here for breakfast one morning and was marveling over all the choices. I went with the Benedict Arnold (smoked tempeh bacon and tofu scramble \"eggs\" benedict) which was absolutely delicious and appropriately filling. A little pricy, but not too bad for Phoenix. Counter service and then they bring out your food, which came out pretty quickly. Highly recommended for breakfast / Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"This is such a great Vegan coffee and dessert spot, even though I am not a Vegan or Vegetarian I love the yumminess they have here and once you have a Nami you will fall in love with their soy goodness!!! My favorite is Dez Hazelnuts however they don't have that one here at this new location only the one in Tempe.  All coffee drinks come with soy at no additional charge, however if you want hazelnut, almond or pecan there is an additional charge not more than .50 cents. and right across the way there is Green the vegetarian restaurant. With this new set up only food is served at Green and only desserts at Nami.  I like this location as it is not too far from route 51 on my way to and from work so I can stop and get a Fair Trade latte that rivals Starbucks."}
{"text":"my favorite soynamis? the chai and the soy capitan. 

although (with the exception of swizzleberry) i haven't had a soynami i didn't like. YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a friend not really knowing what to expect but I really liked it. They have a huge menu of ice creams to choose from, all vegan and some gluten free. I got the PB&J and it was amazing! It does taste a little different than regular ice cream but I really enjoyed it. They give you a big cup and fill it to the top for just $5. I'm sure I'll find myself back here."}
{"text":"Love this place. It satisfies all my insatiable needs from coffee to vegan parfait and donuts. All vegan all the time. Not too pricey and their staff are ALWAYS amazing. My fave is their Sunday brunch options which are the absolute best vegan breakfasts in the valley."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan desserts! I tried the pumpkin spice cake. The frosting was the best I've ever had- vegan or non! The cake was super moist. The soft serve was amazing as well."}
{"text":"After stuffing ourselves at Green, my husband and I walked over to Nami to top off our meal. We each ordered a Tsoynami. I had the Cookies 'n' Cream and my husband had Coffee Coco Loco. 

The Tsoynamis where huge but they were so good and not overly rich like whole milk ice cream. The added ingredients were plentiful and I had cookie pieces and chocolate syrup in every bite. The wooden spoons wigged us out a little, but we worked through it.

After sitting in Nami eating our Tsoynamis, we couldn't resist getting a few items to go. My husband was excited to find Ethiopian whole coffee beans at a great price ($10). I got a Nami cake--a chocolate cupcake reminiscent of the traditional Hostess variety with white cream filling and chocolate frosting. My first vegan cupcake and such a great one to start with. We also got a delicious looking oatmeal cream pie cookie that was equally delicious. There were so many cupcakes and delicious baked goods to choose from, it was hard to decide. I think Nami will become a regular stop every time we go to Green."}
{"text":"I am not a dessert person by any means but in the 100+ degree Phoenix heat I love a cold Soynami."}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing! Everything is vegan and I love it! There tSoynami's are to die for. I get a different one every time I come here! I love this place so so much. I would even recommend this place to anyone that isn't vegan like myself who is vegetarian."}
{"text":"Went this past Sunday for brunch. Got the biscuits and gravy. Freaking PHENOMENAL. I will definitely be going back. Try everything on the menu has officially been added to my life goals."}
{"text":"Vegan what? Where? I brought my very picky boyfriend to this place to try a treat, I didn't tell him it was a vegan place well into him eating his dessert. He was shocked, he didn't believe me, he thought it was so good and said he was definitely fooled. I had a cinnamon roll, and I too was unable to tell the difference. A delicious late night treat."}
{"text":"Thank you Nami for the amazing, only seasonal pumpkin pie tsoynami! 

The texture of the vanilla wafers was perfect, and the pumpkin purée tasted so fresh. Can't wait to come back to try the banana cream pie and a slice of cake."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place and their sister shop Green for a few years now. 

The tsoynami is just so darn good. I usually order vanilla soy with strawberries, graham crackers and marshmallow fluff mixed in. Perfect.

Their brunch on Sunday's is also great, aside from the long wait to order. But, I don't mind waiting for good food. One thing that did disappoint me last time I was there - I ordered a donut displayed in their case (along with other breakfast entrees for my group) and paid. While waiting for the food, they told me that they actually already sold the last of that donut. I really love donuts and it was one of the main reasons for my trip there so I was pretty bummed. They did have one other flavor left, maple. I settled for it and of course it was delicious so I wasn't too upset at that point... although I did have my heart set on the one I ordered and paid for. 

You guys are great, only recommendation - make more donuts for Sunday mornings!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito I have EVER had. EVAR!!!!

The country breakfast burrito is to die for. It is now what I want for my last meal on Earth. Yes, it is that fantastic. I ordered:

1.  Country breakfast burrito (tofu scramble was perfect! with a touch of maple syrup. I'm drooling,,)
2.  Drip coffee (with hazelnut milk. wow!)
3.  Chocolate chip cookie (I waited to eat this later, and it is good that I did. If I had been able to buy a dozen and devour them at that moment, I would have.)
4.  NO's 'n' Mint tsoynami (texture is more ice milk than ice cream, but absolutely decadent, and I drank the melted tsoynami at the end.)

Bottom line, if I lived in Phoenix, this would be my go to breakfast place!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when Nami opened. It's a great compliment to the already amazing Green. Nami has pretty much everything you'd want in terms of sweet as a vegan. 

Great pastries,coffee,doughnuts, and ice cream treats as well as a rotating Sunday brunch. I've never had a bad thing at this place and that's no exaggeration.

It can get pretty crowded in there during peak hours but honestly the service is fast enough that I never worry.

Check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"The vegan blueberry doughnut might be the best doughnut I've ever had. It was so soft and flavorful! Not only did it have blueberries scattered throughout, it also tasted like graham crackers, which I loved. I only meant to try a couple bites, but I ended up eating the whole thing.

I also tried their soy ice cream with animal crackers mixed in. It's icier than regular ice cream, but letting it melt a bit helps. The addition of the mix-ins turned it into a vegan, customizable McFlurry!

If I lived in Phoenix, I'd definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"This place is one-of-a-kind! Vegan soft serve and treats! I love all their soft serve creations and options, which are numerous, diverse, and fun. More importantly, they all taste very good. You have the option of choosing which soft serve you want: vanilla, chocolate, or swirl. 

The place itself is a tiny shop and seating can be limited during busy times. The same idea applies to parking. Customer service is always great. The employees are always friendly, and they always work very quickly."}
{"text":"Nami provided a fabulous sweet ending to a recent date night with my husband... We were full from dinner at nearby Oven + Vine, but wanted a little something sweet, so to Nami we went.

I'd been hearing from about tSoynamis for years, but since I'm not Vegan and don't live or work in the area, I never made it a priority to go.  That being said, our tSoynami definitely lived up to it's expectations... 

Since we wanted to share, the first step was agreeing on one of the 20+ flavors.  I didn't want anything chocolate based, and my husband is very particular, so this was quite a challenge.  I narrowed it down to Fluffernutterin, Chai Tiramisu, O', Soy Capitan, and Ginger Snap!  Jared chose the Chai Tiramisu from there.  

Made from organic chai, organic animal crackers, soy whip and Nami's house-made organic soy based \"tsoft tserve\" ice cream, it was a hit, even considering the ten minute wait after we ordered.  (This is one popular spot!)  We finished the entire thing and agreed that it was $4.50 that was well worth it!

I didn't realize that Nami also offers breakfast, coffee, and all kinds of vegan treats in addition to their famous tSoynamis.  Vegan or not, this place is worth a visit... and I'll look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"If you're GF this is the place to get your long lost fixes!  Great gf donuts, ice cream and friendly, trendy people working there.  The hours are great because I was there late and had my food boxed up and ready to go.  This area in PHX is pretty cool.  Check it out even if you're not GF.  I always have a high regard for bacon maple donuts and places that are risqué enough to sell them.  Good food get some!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but amazing nonetheless. The toddy is sooo good unsweetened over ice. Everyone that works here is so cute and very sweet - also really nice to my dog, unlike many other coffee shops that tend to glare at you when you come in holding a dog in your arm. 

love love love"}
{"text":"they close at 9pm instead of 9:30pm but haven't updated yelp with the coreect time. they are open 11-9 monday thru saturday. the menu looks great...i'm looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER!! Line was long and very slow, but even worse, after we ordered our donuts we were told to have a seat and they will bring it out. We waited for over 20min after ordering and watched them serve several people at the register after us. I returned to counter to inquire about our order and was told they lost our ticket on the floor and just served the last of what we ordered to the people behind us. The manager did nothing to resolve the situation despite our near hour wasted at there cafe. I was refunded my money with an uncaring apology as the manager then turned to the girl at the register and said \"it's ok, don't worry about it\"  I understand mistakes happen, but this is just not the way to make things right and gain a new customer. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"What a treat. This was the first time I had been to Nami since it has opened. I have been to Green vegetarian restaurant and had a Nami dessert. Last night I got the puppy chow benefiting one love pitbull rescue and it was fantastic. Being vegan has helped me cut out sweets and Nami has helped me put them right back in!"}
{"text":"Stood for quite some time before being acknowledged and then it was a very bland, how can I help you? We ordered 2 maple bars, 2 glazed, and one mocha doughnut and they were not good at all! very dense and every flavor tasted the same- just flavorless sugar. Very small inside and out, and 30$ for tasteless doughnuts just isn't cool ( and blah blah using quality ingredients and better employee pay isn't a good enough excuse, somehow other great places offer yummy affordable vegan sweets). No thanks."}
{"text":"I have a dairy allergy and a weakness for Ice Cream. I tried one of Nami's tSoynami's ($4.50 for a lot) which is sort of like a DQ Blizzard only made with what tastes like Homemade Ice Cream only this has Soy rather than Cow milk. I went with the Fluffernutterin (organic peanut butter, banana, ricemellow fluff and toasted marshmallow flavor). I can honestly say this was better than a DQ Blizzard. They also have yummy cupcakes and cookies and other treats, coffee & Sunday Brunch. I also like their restaurant Green located next door and I am far from a Vegetarian but good is good."}
{"text":"I was next door for a UYE and as a group it was decided we who were already stuffed \"needed\" dessert. So off we went. I had not been here before so I followed the lead of those that had and ordered a tSoynami. The base is a soy soft serve \"ice cream\". They have different add ins just like if you were getting frozen yogurt. Mine combo was labeled \"life's a Peach\". It had chunks of peach, granola and caramel. Very good. I certainly could not tell it wasn't dairy based."}
{"text":"Several gluten free options for baked goods. Delicious flavored water and the Namis are delicious"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but it just didn't impress me all that much. I came to try out their doughnuts. I got there at opening and the doughnuts weren't out so I had to wait around. Ended up getting a chocolate banana doughnut which was just okay - if you're looking for a vegan baked doughnut Urban Cookies just down the road has much better tasting doughnuts (imo). Also got a \"clunky monkey\" tsoynami - this was pretty good except for the fact that it was more pecans than ice cream. Overall not bad but not enough to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Seriously don't go here if you are hungry. I'm pretty patient, but after 20 minutes in line they forgot to make one of our parfaits and then forgot to make one of our entrees. Also a pain in the butt to find parking. The food is pretty good but this is a classic example of how a horrible experience can ruin a good product. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a little spot, there is wifi but maybe a little hard to sit and work if it's busy. 
Donuts are amazing! Come by early to make sure you get one (and believe me one is enough) 
Toddy (ice coffee) is okay, very mild."}
{"text":"Complete opposite experience with staff, found the cashier to be down right nasty to everyone while I was waiting for my order.....thoroughly unimpressed"}
{"text":"Although I usually do like vegan/soy-based ice cream, I didn't like the actual ice cream here too much. I got a tsoynami, and the mix-ins helped make it a little more enjoyable. It's really just a matter of taste, so I would definitely try it for yourself before writing it off. My boyfriend actually loved his tsoynami, and I definitely want to try some of their donuts and pastries so I certainly will stop in this place again. 

The location is good, it's pretty easily accessible, and there is plenty of parking. The staff is friendly enough, and it was very clean inside and out."}
{"text":"Those of us who are living the dairy-free lifestyle, whether by choice or allergy, miss ice cream. Any one who says otherwise is lying - especially in the depths of Arizona summer.

So, when your 110-degree world is enlightened by dairy free ice cream that doesn't taste like saw dust and veggie particles, you're likely willing to join a cult just to keep Nami in your life. Though that isn't necessary, yet.

The space downtown is small and parking can be a problem, but it's worth every kind of inconvenience.

But at the end of the day, they put pretzels in soft serve ice cream. So... Five Stars."}
{"text":"Ok, I have to admit I haven't been here as much as I have gone to Green in Tempe/Scottsdale but I really which I could come here more. 

The desserts are AMAZING and thank God, vegan! I forgot the name of the ice cream I got... coco coffee? It is coffee flavored ice cream with coco puffs in it. OMG so freaking good. The cupcakes here are a bit pricey for what you get. The oatmeal cookie with the creme in between in so good. It isn't overly sweet and it tastes healthy even though it has sugar in it. 

Took my non vegan friends here and they loved the captain crunch ice cream (forgot what else was in it). I wish the inside of this place was bigger but you could always go next door to green I'm sure."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place if you're looking for breakfast, lunch, dinner (?), coffee and dessert. I've been here a few times and have loved everything that I have tried here! First time I came I had a breakfast bagel with \"bacon, ham and egg\" with some type of spicy sauce and a side of fruit, such a good breakfast! 

Their breakfast is on point from what I've seen from other pictures also. They are also known for their tsoynami vegan ice cream, they have  pretty unique flavors and taste so good! The building itself is pretty darn small but size doesn't matter because it's really cute inside and they make up for it with their great food. It's usually not too busy when I go, probably because I go at odd hours, so I'm always the first (and only) one in line so I get my order pretty quickly. 

Staff is generally nice and welcoming so that's always a plus. So glad I will be closer to this location so I can come more often and try their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Who am I kidding? I love Nami, but I hate their small parking lot. Don't come during peak times! It's a nightmare. I usually come late at night on a weekday. 

My favorite flavors is the Coffee Coco Loco and Rocky Road!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Daughter took me here and would recommend people to try it!  I had the mango fruit smoothie and was full of yumminess! The place is cute and atmosphere is nice to sit and chat with your friends."}
{"text":"Prickly pear iced tea, I REPEAT TRY THE PRICKLY PEAR ICED TEA. RIGHT. NOW. The chai tea blew my mind, might have surpassed Lux's (just might have). Tried an apple fritter ball and went to heaven! Okay on a serious note, this is a cute little vegan coffee shop that provides vegan pastries, ice cream (yes to my lactose intolerant friends!), and food. The shop is cute, the two girls that were running the show behind the counter were kickin butt and takin names since they were slammed and they were super helpful to us Nami virgins (my husband and I). We will definitely be back to try the ice cream because we kept on drooling seeing all the people walk by with these amazing looking cups nestled in their hands. OH JYAHHHH....."}
{"text":"tsoynami. some crazy vegan cold stone blizzard. they make their own vegan soft serve and it's actually very good. you can pick all sorts of things to mix into it and it's delicious. They have tons of donuts, baked goods, and coffee drinks."}
{"text":"Vegan desserts in the AZ desert. Is this an episode of the twilight zone? 

It's just a testament to the growing diversity in body, mind and palette here everyday.

I love the fact that I eat their ice cream and don't feel fat afterwards."}
{"text":"OK, each star represents a visit during my less-than-48 hour visit to PHX. YES, I WENT TO NAMI FIVE TIMES IN TWO DAYS. Don't judge. Vegan soft serve is hard to find, people.

3 trips were for tSoynamis.  AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!  had Fluffernutterin, Chai Tiramisu & S'mores.  brought non-vegan friends & they loved it, too.

2 trips were for coffee. the lattes were yummy.  also had a yogurt parfait, delish!

Amazing looking pastries- saving that for next time.

Staff are super friendly & hip & helpful."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing at this place. Favorites are the DONUTS (Raspberry & Maple). Great lattes and a fun atmosphere. 

Nice staff and clean place! Would recommend to anyone for breakfast, coffee and ice cream treat."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's super chill, the people are great, and I don't have to worry about asking what they could make for me because it's all VEGAN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Head next door to Green, Grub on some good food, then head back over here for dessert.

Tsoynamis are delicious. Do I ever get anything else? I def think about it... but no. Their deserts look tasty, but I can't say no to \"ice cream\".

Location inside is cute and clean. Parking sometimes is a pain, but worth it,"}
{"text":"It's close to my work, so anytime I want ice cream, I go here (even though Coldstone is closer). They have awesome flavors. My favorites are the coffee coco loco and there is a special cookie dough one...Awesome. The people that work there are really nice, and if you have a million questions about what kind of cinnamon they use in their cookies, they won't get mad and they'll actually answer. The only downside is the tiny parking lot for Nami+Green, but you can usually make do."}
{"text":"You guys are great only reason I don't get five stars is because there is simply no room. You guys need to expand, The weekends are just a no go because there is no where to wait , eat , or park"}
{"text":"I went for the brunch today. 
First of all I just don't understand why they didn't serve brunch at Green, that's where the kitchen is. They were very adamant about waiting until 9am until anyone could place a brunch order even though the place was filling up before 9am. 
Though once orders were placed food came quickly.

The plates were brought over from Green and probably played a hand in why the food wasn't hot, but it was more likely due to it being pre made, quite possibly the day ahead of time, and not heated well, which in turn made for a very dry tofu scramble.
 I got the Sage Sausage Hashsheesh, unfortunately no sage flavor just one note flavor, even so, it would have tasted better Hot and it would have been nice to have toast with it as well.

By the time we left it was standing room only. 

I may be pointing out the obvious here but Nami should stick to being a coffee and pastry shop and let real meals be at Green where food can be served hot from the kitchen into a dining room that can accommodate more people. Maybe consider having an option to order brunch at Nami for the overflow but to have it solely there is asinine.


P.S.
I'd like to add that the first time I visited Nami I ordered the Fluffernutterin
Soynami which is ORGANIC peanut butter, banana, ricemellow fluff and toasted marshmellow flavor and I stood there and watched her scoop in SKIPPY Peanut Butter=Not Cool=False Advertising=Fail!"}
{"text":"Protip - getting a fruit tsoynami with chocolate chip is a great life choice. Right next to Green, Nami has a diverse array of vegan desserts. They're definitely a little over sweet, but if you keep your sweet tooth in tow then you're in for a treat. 

Just a note that there isn't always a lot of space to sit."}
{"text":"LOVE pretty much everything here.  The dirty horchata, and Big Ole burrito are my favorites. Picture a creamy horchata frap with espresso, sooooo good on a hot day."}
{"text":"If you're used to dairy-free ice cream then you'll probably like their stuff here. I personally thought the ice cream was creamy and very tasty. My husband, on the other hand, had a spoonful and stopped there. He was not a fan of the taste at all. We also got a chocolate and strawberry cupcakes. The chocolate one was really moist and actually tasted like chocolate. The strawberry one not so much. It tasted more like a bland muffin. Would not order that flavor again. 

Again, if you are a fan of dairy-free already, you might actually really like this place. Worth a try. 

Overall, the prices are pretty high. And I get it, it's a hip place and they can get away with charging $5 a cupcake but I don't think I can justify spending that much on a bland cupcake again.

Oh and parking is a nightmare so good luck there."}
{"text":"The best dairy free place in town! I come here because of my wife's dietary restrictions, but I leave satisfied. The PB & Chocolate is a great one. The people aren't the nicest at times that work there, but some are friendly."}
{"text":"Nami's brunch on Sunday and breakfast all other days are the bomb. I love their Acai and Quiche during the week. Sunday brunch is a completely different menu and always has a special. All I can say is Nami is a special place."}
{"text":"Not a vegetarian or vegan, but I LOVE this place.  The food is amazing enough to convert a carnivore. Recommend to all my friends!"}
{"text":"when you're gluten-free, vegan, soy milk and almond milk intolerant and you can't have any caffeine, it's torture to go into any bakery or coffeehouse.  Not at Nami.  What was great about this place was the gluten-free vegan treats...yes they are sugary...my favorite is the two snickerdoodle cookies pressed together with some sort of awesome creamy goodness in the middle.  And, they can make steamers with rice or coconut milk!!!  finally a coffeehouse I feel good going to!"}
{"text":"You guys!!!! The vegan ice cream is life changing. I've been baptized in the vegan waters and I'm a believer. 
Believe me- if you get stomach aches from dairy your going to be converted! This stuff is holly.
Hallelujah!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Phoenix's Nami for years. What used to be one of my favorite vegan establishments has become a place that causes me to leave regretting wasting my money. The food and beverages continue to be great, but accompanied by awful service! Tonight I ordered a simple iced espresso drink before I go into work. I watched the two customers ahead of me get their orders and leave. Then I sat for 8 minutes while the five employees did anything but make my drink. I was the ONLY customer in the restaurant at this point, and clearly sitting there waiting for my order. It took another customer coming in and getting their coffee immediately after ordering to finally say, \"Hey, is my drink going to be made?\" They all looked at each other and started making it (took 30 seconds to make - not 9 minutes like I waited) but not a single apology from any of them, let alone eye contact. A guy made the drink, set it on the counter and walked away quickly. So glad I spent $6 on a beverage and was treated with such awful customer service! As someone in the restaurant industry, I know mistakes happen but this kind of treatment to a paying customer is never acceptable!"}
{"text":"This place is REALLY small but their lunch place is right next door with a lot of seating. EVERYTHING is vegan so it's nice to not have to double check. And their pastries are the BEST vegan pastries I've ever had hands down. The Captain Crunch donut haunts my dreams. Now that we know about this place we are constantly going back."}
{"text":"I always get excited for vegan breakfast places. This place exceeded all expectations! The biscuits and gravy is awesome! And it comes with tofu scramble and hash potatoes. Such a great place with a great vibe."}
{"text":"Literally every time I come in here I know I will be treated to beautiful, gluten free-vegan orgasms in my mouth. Seriously, the food is that good. I have happily drooled thinking about the food at Green and the desserts at Nami and then hopped in my car and made the trek from Mesa to Phoenix on many occasions because it is just that good."}
{"text":"Nami is really a one-of-a-kind place. I love what they're doing and what they stand for; good vegan restaurants in Phoenix are few and far between. It's rad that they offer a few raw options now- the raw power breakfast is soso good. I will say that some of the staff at Nami is extremely unfriendly and sometimes rude, acting as if the customers are an inconvenience to them. However, Katie is always really nice. Overall, I'm a fan and will continue to come back but their coffee isn't very strong and that makes me sad."}
{"text":"I'll drive across town just for a soynami 
Don't forget to grab one of their gluten free cheesecakes while you're there too! Great service and the best deserts!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Nami stop what you are doing and head over there for some sweet treats!! 

Everything is delicious, the craft beer selection goes on for days; I can eat here everyday. Too bad brunch is only from 9-2pm"}
{"text":"Wow their soynamis are amazing . Seriously can't tell it's vegan at all, so rich with flavors ! I had their carrot cake one pmg omg perfect mix of cake soy nami and white choco.    I'm not vegan but have friend and family with lactose allergy and gluetin allergy , but their selections of baked goods are fantastic as well.     I wish I can make it myself.  Tried their lactose free gluten free cheese cake and was fantAstic. Wow definitely my new fav. Spot is so cute, artsy and warm green feel.  Next time I'm going to try their pumpkin soynami and their breakfasts, I'm sure they will be great.     Service was awesome, friendly and knowledgable about ingredients :).   5 stars!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and have a laundry list of food allergies, yet there is always something at Nami that I can eat, and not only that, but I can actually enjoy it. The cupcakes are great and so are the different tsoynamis. I like to get the ones with cereal in them, but that's me. Most of my friends are not vegan/veg at all and still really enjoy this place, there really is something for everyone, and I've always had very friendly people working there help me when I don't know what I want. Nami is great!"}
{"text":"I usually don't review places that I have only been to once, but I had such a bizarrely mixed experience at Nami that I just had to speak up. 

We decided on Nami after reading great reviews of brunch on Yelp.  

I hate it when you walk into a restaurant and it isn't immediately obvious what you're supposed to do: sit down? Wait to be seated? Order at the counter? Well this was one of those places, so we did what everyone else was doing and got on line at the counter. 

There was almost no evidence of a brunch. No one was eating brunch. The kitchen didn't look big enough to produce brunch foods. There were no obvious brunch menus. Just one hand lettered sign about a brunch special.  My husband wanted to walk out, but I said no, I saw the brunch on their website, lets wait and see what they say. 

So we finally get to the front of the line and ask about brunch. The girl at the counter says \"yes, we are serving brunch, there should be some menus on the tables.\" And she sends us over to the seating area. 

We went and found menus on one of the tables and realized there was no table service. We got BACK on the line, which was now pretty long. We waited. I ordered and paid. Tables were filling up quick.  We got the last two-top in the small dining room. Whew. 

As soon as we sat down, I realized I was so flustered from the menu experience that I'd forgotten to order a side of sage sausage hash. So I got back on line AGAIN.  I noticed another waitress handing brunch menus to the people behind me in line. Which really, really annoyed me. Right after that I learned that the young lady who originally helped us was a trainee, which explains the menu fiasco, but doesn't excuse her lack of common sense. 

By the time I finished ordering again and paying again, I had just enough time to grab two free cups of citrus infused water and get back to our table before the food came out. Wow, quick! Except that we only got one of the two coffees we ordered, and it was in a to-go cup (why? Aren't you guys trying to keep stuff out of landfills?)

So here is the good part of my review. The food was really interesting. We ordered huevos rancheros and chilaquiles. The tofu scramble was one of the best I've had. The chilaquiles were a unique presentation in the form of a \"cake\", kind of like a mille-feuilles pastry.  The posole was addictively good. And when we finally got the sage sausage \"hashsheesh\", it too was vibrantly flavorful. My only complaint with the food is that a few items were kind of dry (chilaquiles, hash) and could have used more of the sauce, sour cream, etc.  that came with them. 

My long-awaited coffee arrived scaldingly hot, with unpleasant looking curdled soymilk floating in it. I remember having curdling issues with soymilk and hot coffee when I first went vegan back in the 1980s, but it hasn't happened to me in a long time.  Meanwhile, my husband's coffee with soymilk was just fine. So I asked one of the waitresses if it was \"normal\" and after some  discussion of how it should go away if I stirred it (it didn't), she offered to bring another one with steamed soymilk.  Kind of a surprise after being sent to get my own menu and losing my place in line, but I wasn't complaining! 

My husband ordered another entree, because he is shameless, so we got to experience the Benedict Arnold, which came along with my new coffee. Again in a takeout cup? (Why? I don't know why!)  More surprisingly vivid flavors from the Canadian bacon and the vegan hollandaise sauce, which was on the thin side but very tasty. And this time, HE got to wait in line to order and pay (folks, if you're counting, that's four waits in line just to have brunch.)

By the time we finished the last bite of tofu scramble, my coffee was still undrinkably hot and we were not at all in a mood to wait on line a fifth time for a pastry or a tsoynami to go.

So there you go: a mixed review. Very good food, but in an atmosphere that made me feel uncomfortable and stressed instead of relaxed and happy. Pretty much the opposite of the \"mini-celebration\" brunch experience described on the website. If Nami switched to table service and one bill at the end instead of counter service, I would be there every weekend (if I lived in Phoenix...)"}
{"text":"First of all, the people who work here are great and very welcoming. It's great!

At first I didn't know this place was vegan, and when I found out I was surprised. It's great! I'm vegetarian and try to eat vegan foods as much as possible. I also do not eat gluten, and it's great that they have vegan, and gluten free pastries! As well as vegan and gluten free ice cream.

The price is very reasonably, $5.00 on the dot, for an ice cream. You can even add extra pecans or strawberries, etc., at no extra cost. 

I would recommend this place to anyone who wants great ice cream! Vegan, vegetarian, or not, I'm sure everyone will enjoy it. 

The decor is nice as well. With local artists selling their artwork. It's very minimalistic. Which is very nice. It goes with the PHX downtown vibe."}
{"text":"Super, super, super yummy!  Just because everything they serve is vegan doesn't mean is less calories. We splurged today for our anniversary and I had a doughnut and my husband had a piece of cake and a latte. Oh my gosh, this is the BEST vegan dessert I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Incredible selection of raw and vegan options with relaxing environs and friendly customer service.  Likely a cult following here as I saw many at the altar of nearly obsessive compulsive food disorders making their way through the variety.  In all seriousness this is a great spot to chill but you could blow by it in a heartbeat as the expletive is creativity abounds and still it gets lost in all the strip malls surrounding."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I take everyone here! I love this place so much. Unfortunately I have a lactose intolerance, so ice cream is a no-no, but this place makes vegan ice creammmm YAY!! I've tried everything on the menu and it's all so delicious:) they also have a bunch of vegan pastries if you are into that!"}
{"text":"Cute, friendly, quick easy place to grab a pastry & coffee or maybe a milkshakeMy sister & I were really only there for about 15 min. When I'm  back in the area I will definitely go back.  Nice place to hang with your bud and chill.  We were on our way to the Phoenix Theater that is right around the block.  Looked like a younger type crowd.  I just had a toasted bagel which was delicious. Love the atmosphere with both inside & out door seating.  The line was out the door but the line moved quickly.  And I just LOVED the milk carton water they are selling in place of plastic bottles!!"}
{"text":"I'm afraid I can't join the chorus of approval on Nami. The place is a microcosm of what's wrong with commercialized veganism today -  an excessive focus on highly processed imitation animal products and high sugar junk foods that are just as terrible for your health as if they were made with animal products.

You'd think that their brunch menu would have some delicious, high quality cooked or roasted vegetables, but it's almost all fake meat, fake eggs and fake cheese -  all identified only by what they're imitating, not the actual ingredients. 

I ended up eating a Yogurt Parfait which was very good and enjoyable, the plate of House Veggies, which were tasteless and gross, and a raw brownie which was tasteless and dry. I won't be eating at Nami again."}
{"text":"Growing up on café glace, it is hard to come by in the states....but, wait ...is it??  YES my friends- it is not a dream, it really DOES exist...at least here in Phoenix!  I ordered an affogato & it was heaven. It filled that nostalgia for café glace that I have had for so many years!  Thank you for this delicious cafe & bakery because I will be here EVERY week!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but I gave up all meat and dairy for the first week of lent. Decided to come here with a friend because I was craving ice cream. Staff is very nice and friendly, location is perfect and plenty of parking. I got the banana cream pie and it was actually good. I could tell it wasn't regular ice cream because I know and love my dairy, so the imitation  whip cream was what gave it away -and honestly didn't care for and next time I will ask to have it without it - but the rest was fine. The sweetness was on par and was not too overly done, as a lot of healthy food places try to do to cover up the bad taste, the add tons of sugar. The crinkles in my ice cream gave a crunch and a nice added flavor. I'd definitely come back and would love to try other flavors. It was a good experience and I am hoping I can find my new vegan ice cream flavor."}
{"text":"My Nami/Green experience were like night and day. Green was awful, to say the least. Nami was damn good. The service was great. We came with a party of 7 people, and the man who took our order was patient and helpful. Everyone got something different, and we were all beyond satisfied. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend who is vegan loves this place. I also love coming here. We usually like coming here on Saturday and Sunday mornings for there breakfast specials. Their deserts are the best! You should definitely come here even if you're not vegan. The staff is great too!"}
{"text":"Very tasty vegan ice cream... tasted incredibly creamy, with a vanilla and coconut base. I loved it. I got the thin mint ice cream and I relished in every bite.

They also use wooden spoons, which are a weird dry texture on  your mouth, but still pretty neat.

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Okay I tried a different Tsoynami flavor and it is a winner! Haystack Attack (GF)
organic chocolate, pretzels, coco cereal and marshmallow fluff. YUM."}
{"text":"Soynami...delicious......."}
{"text":"Last Friday, a friend and I were at the baseball game when she recommended trying Nami, even saying I would like it better than my favorite ice cream place. We looked up the hours and left the game early. We booked it down to Nami before closing, arriving right at 9:30. We were told they had to close the drawer and could only serve the two parties in front of us but could not serve us. I was flabbergasted that a company would have such a lack of customer service and refuse our business. I was so excited to try this place but will not be going back because of how we were treated. I will be sure to share my experience at Nami with others."}
{"text":"We stopped today to try the baked goods.  HOLY INSULIN SHOT, Batman!!  The icing has so much sugar in it, it actually crackles when you break the surface.  The cake part was good, but wow...I had to scrape of all the icing first.  Similar with the oatmeal cream pie.  Cookie was good (but VERY sweet) and same with the \"cream\" inside (sickeningly sweet icing).  The Samoan bar was OK (lots of coconut, which was very nice)."}
{"text":"The food is too good... I can't stay away or bitter. The service is more helpful. I'm glad I'm back. Go Vegans Go...  Yum!"}
{"text":"After going to Greens scooted next door for some AMAZING baked goods.  DELICIOUS!!!  Hard to believe it is all vegan!  Lemon cupcakes are the best!!!  Everyone enjoyed the soynamis too!!"}
{"text":"WOW.. to be honest WOW

I thought I had some good vegetarian food before, but this place owns it all. 

Best Mock meat i have ever had! My fiancee got the mock chicken, (some noodle dish, i forget the name, but it was around the top of the menu), I got a tofu version of the spicy noodle bowl (whatever their name was i forget, i will know it if i see it)

Needless to say i really enjoyed each dish. I would love to try other things on their menu and I think...no i KNOW we will be back some time too.

Their coffee shop is freakn awesome, which is next door. I got a drink there, my fiancee got some vegan pastries after me telling her don't cause i never had a good one before.

Well i was wrong they were pretty good cookies...(though i don't like to mention it too often). the coffee was great too. It helps when you have friendly fun baristas working. 

No snobs here. just people who love their jobs. (unless you are the jerk who comes i and tries to start something)"}
{"text":"Nami and Green's are the place to be if you're a vegetarian and you're looking for some creative vegetarian cuisine. It's not uncommon for vegetarians and vegans alike to struggle to find quality meals outside of their own kitchen that satisfy nutritional need as well as great taste - at Nami and Green's you won't have that problem. On Sundays, enjoy a brunch by Nami and seating in Greens - bring your non-vegetarian friends and enjoy a meal that's appropriate and delicious for everyone. Get there early however - parking is competitive!"}
{"text":"Only place in town to get anything like it - Tsoynamis - like vegan blizzards. They have a ton of other vegan treats and make cakes for special events too. We recently discovered weekend brunch - all vegan breakfasts, coffee drinks, and they even have Bloody Marys."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Nami for quite some time now and thoroughly love it.  I figured it was time to write a review. I always get the peanut butter chocolate tsoynami, which I love.   Last night, I ordered a kitty ditty with chocolate ice cream and it is my new favorite.  It was awesome!   Also, the truffles are great!"}
{"text":"When I'm lucky enough to have ten minutes to stop in to Nami it's the best! The staff is incredibly pleasant and I'm flattered when they remember who I am! I'm fortunate to have a place to go with yummy vegan breakfast when I'm on the go. Thank you guys for being kind to me when I'm in"}
{"text":"I only head here when I am craving a delicious tsoynami. Parking is somewhat of a nightmare, and my boyfriend and I always flip a coin to see who has to drive there. The staff is okay unless they see a hipster buddy, then they will take their time talking to them and serve them first. I recommend the mash tsoynami, and I recommend that the staff cater to all customers and not show preferences"}
{"text":"Okay for what it is I supposed.  Didnt finish my gluten free donut or machiatto."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I ordered the dough boy swirl when I got my ice cream back it was a huge chocolate mess no vanilla what so ever. (Note I've been here multiple times and know what it should look like) I tried to eat it but it was just too much chocolate. I went back to let one of the girls there know with a dirty look on her face she quickly said no exchanges and turned her back to me right away. Literally no care in the world, not even I'm sorry let me try to make it better. So if you want to get something you didn't order don't bother letting the staff know because they don't care! Definitely wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband said he \"found a place\" and we ended up here :) Came for breakfast, and it was hard not to get every single thing just because I was finally in a place where it was dairy-free! Even so, we ended up getting the yogurt parfait with fresh fruit, the bagel with schmagel and the nami McBagel sandwich. Despite not being vegan eaters (just DF), my husband had the McBagel and we were both very impressed by the herb cream cheese. It's better than any I've tasted or purchased! This isn't much of a restaurant as much as \"get it and go\" type of place, but we'd definitely come here again. I also enjoyed the cinnamon haboob latte with hazelnut milk! Big thanks to both Nami and my thoughtful hubby!"}
{"text":"A good place to get vegan baked goods.  Items are a little expensive, but generally tasty.  Parking can be a challenge."}
{"text":"The hazelnut chai drink is top notch! I haven't tried many of the desserts because they are almost always out of everything by the time I get there late at night... but I guess that is a good thing right? They must be good and popular! :P Anyway I'm mainly on here to give a quick shoutout to Arty (spelling?) for being the most happy and friendly worker I have ever encountered in any food place anywhere! :)"}
{"text":"Had pitaya bowl and and rocky road tsunami. I'm not vegan but I am gluten free the pitaya bowl was amazing."}
{"text":"Great spot to hit for vegan pastries and delicious drinks. I've had and loved their \"Betterfinger\" tsoynami. It's basically a vegan version of a mcflurry for those who were allowed to eat those as a kid....but way better. It's vegan soft serve with mashed up chocosticks, chocolate chips and some sort of toffee syrup. 

Also delicious is their \"yanky-doodle\" cookie. It's two chewy soft perfect snickerdoodle cookies with some sort of sweet vegan cream between like a cream sandwich. Holy yum. 

Their donuts are a bit cake like and not really donutty like the gf donuts at Jewel's bakery. But this should not stop you because hey, cake rocks too! 

Other notables... A mint latte drink, vegan chocolate shake (not too sweet and really great), cupcakes etc.

There is seating but it's not very comfy cozy...a bit more on the modern industrial meets cement and wood. You'll get over it though as you delight in sugar.

All in all, this place should definitely be a part of your life."}
{"text":"My favorite sweet spot! I love the banana cream pie ice \"cream\" and for my lady, the seasonal pumpkin pie"}
{"text":"Okay, so as a meat eater I came with a TOTALLY open mind having ADORED Green off of Scottsdale Rd. I guess I was expecting a restaurant, but this is DEFINITELY more like a coffee shop or a much much worse version of Lux. My girls and I went for brunch and were very excited, unfortunately the food was NOWHERE near the caliber of what is served at Green. 

My girls had some parfait thing, and a donut while I had a bagel with cream cheese and an Italian soda. My bagel and cream cheese were tasty but ABSOLUTELY bland, no chives, no onion, no nothing to spice this bad boy up. My girls said the donut was dry and revolting and the parfait was nothing she couldn't make at home with yoplait and some granola. I have been WAITING to go here with my boyfriend and decided for a sneak peak and I'm glad my boyfriend didn't come because he would have been SO disappointed. For now, only Green is on the radar. It got two stars because the girl taking our order was very gracious and sweet.

We promptly finished our food and then drove over to America's for street tacos and Vampiro's. Sorry Nami."}
{"text":"Nami is delish and nutrish. Definitely one of the best places to get some yummy Soy-Nami in Phoenix. Next door to Green Vegetarian, The place seems to attract the skinny jeans/asymmetrically hair brigade. Great place to people watch that's for sure."}
{"text":"Try a chai tsoynami, so good, the soy whip is amazing!"}
{"text":"The tsoynami's here are delicious. I had the almond oy-vay: coconut, chocolate syrup and almonds. My friend made her own with peanut butter, coconut and chocolate cookies.  Both were really good and pretty large for $4.50. We also tried the chocolate baked donut and the granola. The donut was okay, the granola had lots of cashews and cinnamon and was really tasty. Definitely the highlight was the tsoynamis i wouldnt come back for the test. Yeah the people working there could be friendlier but it wont stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"I usually don't review something food related unless i have gone to it at least 3 times but with this place i was just so disappointed my second real time in, I don't think I want to come here again. The first time i went here was a random Sunday with my girlfriend and we were looking for places to eat and everything was closed but we say this place had donuts and i was really feeling like having one. Got 2 one for me, one for her and they were really good and would recommend them. The second time we came in for brunch a little before 1 on a Sunday found out they were out of 3 different things on the menu so my girlfriend got the \"Wing\" Ding Dang and I got the French Toast. So we sat down and someone came over to tell me that they're out of the French toast (So 4 different things) and i looked over the menu and I didn't want anything else so i ask just to have a refund. So i have to go back over to the register and there was a line and I don't like to cut so i just waited in line...again. If my girlfriend brings me here again i hope they don't run out of everything and i can actually try something and give this place a good review."}
{"text":"The tsoynami is pretty much just a healthy blizzard in my opinion. I like the ice cream and you can totally taste the coconut milk. Yummy! I think it's good but not that great. I drove from Gilbert to try it. It's a good and cute place but I would only go again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I hit up Nami twice while in Arizona - once for a famed tsoynami (a vegan twist on a Dairy Queen blizzard), second time for breakfast.  It's such a great gem in the desert, and I love that it's right by where my only friend in the area lives, haha.

The second I started crossing through Phoenix (after 7 hours on the road!), I found my way to Nami to get a cookies and cream tsoynami.  It's a cute little bungalow with way more parking than I anticipated - except this place is popular so it's still not enough, haha.  Everyone working there is so sweet and upbeat, you can't help but be in a good mood, too.  I got my treat and headed to my final destination in Scottsdale.

I found the vanilla soft serve base really disappointing.  It was really icy and melted almost instantly.  It's not the creamy, thick base of blizzards or McFlurries I remember at all.  But it was cold, and I was hot, at the cookie bits throughout were perfect.  I was determined to give them another try on my way out of Phoenix, to grab breakfast before my journey home.

This time, I went with a caramel \"mockiato\" and a McBagel Sandwich.  10 outta 10, on both counts!  The mockiato was a dead ringer for my former favorite at Starbucks, with a little whipped cream and everything!  I'll be real, my sweet tooth has subsided these past few years (maybe thanks to veganism?!), but this was such a treat and the perfect trip down memory lane.  I also looooooved the McBagel Sandwich.  I've got a soft spot for breakfast sandwiches and this was one of the best I've had.  Fried eggy tofu, veg ham, cheddar daiya (I think?),  and spicy aioli on a bagel tasted like something out of my LA favorite, locali, except fully loaded.  I headed on the road to California right after, and didn't need to stop for food the whole way.  That's impressive!

I'd definitely come back here when I'm in the area!  They have so many vegan goodies, that even if the tsoynamis don't impress me, I will not leave empty handed (uhhh s'mores bars and twinkies, anybody?)."}
{"text":"We don't deserve Nami. It's perfect. Part of what makes it so awesome is that they don't always have the same pastries/donuts and you're always wondering what the brunch special is going to be this week. 

If you haven't been here and you're vegan, you need to go. Stop reading this and go. I won't be offended. This is the best vegan joint in the world in my opinion. 

The Rodney Dangerfield (donut sand which) special is definitely what I would choose as a last meal. There's a great selection of breakfast and brunch on the regular menus but it's all about the specials. 

They also have tsoynamis, just like their sister restaurant, green. Real awesome for a hot day. There's parking around even if not in the lot, so don't worry about that. 

The service is amazing. All of the staff are super cool and friendly and they might even refer to you by name. Ooooor I've just had way to many of their donuts. Could be one or the other. 

I moved away from AZ last month and I definitely miss Nami more than I miss some people out there."}
{"text":"I was craving a Soy-Nami the entire drive from Vegas. Was NOT disappointed. Sooo good. Kiddo like his dessert too."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but I still will choose Nami desserts over regular ones! The service is friendly, the vibe of the space is really chill and the desserts are just spectacular. The cookie dough cupcake was divine as was the doughboy Tsoynami. 
I've also gone for breakfast in the past- the acai bowls are really big and come with all the fixings. Solid spot!"}
{"text":"Loved the Samoan bar,  it was very moist and flavorful. Great atmosphere and nicely decorated. I tried the chocolate peanut butter cupcake; the cake itself was a little dense and the frosting was a tad too sweet for my liking but overall great effort."}
{"text":"VEGAN PIES! Need I SAY MORE. The soft serve is amazing and and toppings imaginative. We have also ordered several vegan cakes, and though not cheap - the end product was nothing short of amazing. People couldn't believe it was vegan and wanted more, despite the presence of other, more decadent and obviously non-vegan alternatives. Great company, amazing foods!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! I ordered the Wing Ding Dang Burrito (breakfast) minus the flour tortilla. Everything came out quick and tasty!"}
{"text":"So adorable and delicious treats! I am not a vegan but the tsoynami is delicious. Great customer service and great atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Delightful!

After visiting Green New American next door, we thought it would be nice to finish off a wonderful meal with a wonderful dessert.  In a word:  Wow!  Even if you didn't save room for dessert, it is worth ignoring that little voice in your head telling you moderation is a good thing.  Moderation can wait until tomorrow, but these sweet treats cannot!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to get here for ages.

Was less selection than I expected (1 lonely slice of cake on the counter) but bunch o cupcakes and I got 1 big bar thingie to take home, was good, but I will have to go back and try other stuff too."}
{"text":"I HAVEN'T HAD A DONUT IN FOUR YEARS. Nami was out of vegan donuts on the day of my visit. :( 
I was not disappointed in getting ice cream though! Ordered the Cone, Thugs and Caramely, split for two. Super yummy! 
I wish I lived near Nami, but my body is probably glad I don't. Super sugar amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for soy, vegan or vegetarian food, but my taste buds and blood sugar level were both happy after a chocolate donut and mocha latte."}
{"text":"Stopped for a vegan soft serve. It was sooo good I am sad I didn't have time to eat more from this place. A must for any fan of sweet treats."}
{"text":"I am simply in love with their Soynami.  Love Love Love.  Wish there was one near my home so that I can get a Coffee, Coco, Loco.  I dream of them.  I highly recommend them to my healthy and my not so healthy friends.  The best."}
{"text":"This place is so witty as you see in reading the menu. I have yet to try the vegan pastries, but I can certainly vouch for the vegan soft serve! My favorite so far is the Soy Capitan with vanilla soft serve. Another bonus is you can create your own tsoynami!"}
{"text":"Vegan baked goods yes!!! I had the cactus haboob latte with cinnamon agave and it was so deliciously refreshing. Not too sweet and substituted with almond milk, it was even more bomb!! The peach cobbler swirl was very good too. Vegan nami chocolate chip cookie was so good minus the guilt because of vegan ingredients.  This spot was right next to the vegan restaurant that had the best stuff in their menu as well. You must visit both while parked in the Lot!! Friendly staff and both great ambiance for small groups. Not recommended for big parties as seatings are limited. Would recommend highly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, casual environment. Love their tsoynami ice cream, but be careful... it's a bit addictive!  Absolutely wonderful spot for veg and non-veg patrons alike."}
{"text":"So goooooooood

After Jon S. introduced me to tsoynamis at Green in Scottsdale, a few friends decided to stop by on our way back to Tempe from Bliss. I was surprised to find a cute little cafe next to Green. The guy at the register was super friendly, and helped my friend decide what flavor to get. I decided on the Cookies n Cream but couldn't help to admire all of the baked goods that they had on display. And their drink menu looked delicious also. 

As expected, the tsoynami was amazing and I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"They're getting sloppy.

While I appreciate the novelty of vegan ice cream (which, most store bought brands are better) with various mix-ins, and vegan baked goods, there is a lot to complain about.

Their facebook touts Hot Fudge Sundays in which affogatos and hot fudge sundaes are $2. We went there and asked for a hot fudge sundae and were met with confusion by the barista who brought over the other girl who explained that they \"do not have sundaes but we can put hot fudge on an ice cream cup.\" 

What? Is that not a sundae?! Did you not have this posted on your facebook as a special? They're doing a poor job of making their staff aware. 

Additionally, the more I get tsoynamis, the more they're screwed up. They often will leave out ingredients or sometimes change them completely. This is a VERY big deal because I am gluten-intolerant... If I order a GF tsoynami, what is the risk they will add a non-GF ingredient and I won't notice until I ingest a bit?

I don't know... Maybe I am over the novelty, or maybe they're just getting sloppy."}
{"text":"Delicious Vegan Desserts!

My husband and I have had multiple tSoynamis and pastry treats here. Our favorites are: the Dough Boy and the PB 'n' J but we have also tried the specials: Banana Cream and Strawberry something and they were so good. The place is small, there's a wait sometimes, and parking is tight but be patient. Your nami will be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in town for work I come here for an ice coffee double shot and a maple bar everyday, the staff is so rad and super friendly not to mention there doughnuts are BOMB"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and we get the Soynami shakes and they are so yummy!  I just had the Betterfinger and I like it better than any dairy alternative because I don't end up with a sick tummy."}
{"text":"Brunch is awesome.  I've come here on two occasions for Brunch and have left satisfied. I've had the sausage hash as a wet chimichanga and it was delicious (though I don't know how anything deep fried cannot be delicious). Last sunday, I got the benedict arnold and it too was great. Even the fake canadian bacon tasted like real meat (though more like bologna, which I think is still delicious).  But the real star of each brunch was the zeppole. Delicious fried donut balls with an sublime strawberry sauce! HEAVEN! 

I don't quite understand why they just don't use the space from Green to host brunch, since all the food comes from that kitchen anyway, but I guess it's a branding thing

The rest of the time, nami is fine. Everything is ok to good, such as the drinks, pastries, and tsoynamis. The donuts I've had there (besides the zeppole tend to get stale very quickly.)

I do get a kick out of the fact that their symbol looks like a little poo."}
{"text":"I want to re-review this place every time I try something new here!  I think the chai tsoynami changed my life last week.  But maybe I'm only saying that because I am lost in a post chocolate peanutbutter cupcake high. So rich.  So moist. Dare I say it?  BETTER than any non-vegan cupcake I've ever had.  Utter decadance."}
{"text":"This place is soooo cute. I've never had dairy-free ice cream before and I was surprised by how good it was! It was sooooo delicious, the chocolate flavor was especially tasty! I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Nice place for sit down, read books, calm chat, and the desserts and everything were perfect!"}
{"text":"Yummy-ness in a cup: tsoynami!! My first cup was the ginger snap with lemon...full to the brim and just the right blended texture. Perfect for these hot summer Phoenix days! Then I had a second try because I was craving it this weekend...the Almond Oy vey! Not made as well as it was last week. But I'm going to try to get to each flavor. Can't wait to try the breakfast, brunch, and coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free doughnuts.  Almost as good as revolution doughnuts in Atlanta.  And that is high praise!!"}
{"text":"So I come here any chance I get and figure it's about time I give back some love.

This place is amazing.

I usually come for the tsoynamis, which are never disappointing. Better than real, dairy-based ice cream!! They have great treats and baked goods, smooth espresso, and friendly staff. Never have I had a bad experience here.  

You won't regret it! Promise!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fabulous dessert place, look no further!! Not only are staff members helpful, they were so nice too.

I ordered the smores and cheesecake. Unbelievable that it's cruelty free. 

Love love love."}
{"text":"Really creative and cool menu that was a little hard to follow. Overall the ice cream was great but doesn't beat normal dairy ice cream. Quick service. Parking was tough but I will definitely be back. Great option if dairy free"}
{"text":"Nami is hands down my absolute favorite dessert establishment in all of Phoenix

Here are a couple of words to describe Nami's tsoynami...

Yummy
Delicious
Wonderful
Heaven in a cup
The perfect dessert

The tsoynami's are home made vegan soy ice cream which you can choose several different topping options with...
There are several fruit flavors as well as their own creations... 
They are all extremely delicious but I think my top 3 are as follows...

1- 
Dough Boy
chocolate chip cookie dough and organic chocolate

2-
NO's 'n' Mint
newman's chocolate O's, mint flavor, organic chocolate

3- 
Clunky Monkey (GF)

fresh banana, organic pecans, organic chocolate

The customer service at Nami is wonderful as each employee is very friendly and knowledgable of the menu but they also provide very helpful tips 

Also, the cookies are fabulous, the cakes are scrumptious, and the coffee is perfect..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always packed when i get there which makes me happy. The banana cream pie soycream is amazing. People who work here are super friendly and polite.Wish theyd have doughnuts more often though. theyre never available when im there. And they need to put prices on their displayed desserts so i dont have to ask how much everything is. Other than that, i love what this place stands for and i will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Cutest little shop in cenpho! Stopped by for a quick coffee and donut. 

I ordered the infamous cactus haboob which by the way taste amazing! It's like the perfect iced coffee concoction! 
I also got the raspberry chocolate donut. And it was good for being a vegan donut. However, a little too bready? If that's even a word. It was literally like a fried piece of bread with icing. Next time I will try a different donut. If you're looking for an airy donut definitely don't get this one. It was yummy overall. 

Their menu is pretty to the point they have their espresso, coffees, iced coffees, and their signature drinks. They also do brunch and all sorts of other yummy meals which I will try next time! 
Customer service was great cashier was very friendly. 
The location is very small and parking is very limited I got there early in the mining so it wasn't too bad, but I feel if it were lunch time I might of been a little hectic. 
Definite must try!"}
{"text":"Came here since my stay at AZ was situated within walking distance to this location. Needless to say I was blown away, I don't think I had anything else within those two days. I tried the breakfast burrito with the veggie nuggets, tsoynami cookie dough and the veggie eggs Benedict. These aren't your traditional dishes as they are replaced with tofu and no meat, but boy were they amazing. The burrito was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of cumin. The tofu looked just like eggs. The tsoynami was probably the best soft serve, thought it melts pretty easily I love how it has the texture of soft serve but not the overwhelming taste of milk. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"peanut butter cookie
carrot cupcake
vanilla cake
banana donut

...one of these things is not like the other...

Just kidding. Those are the four items I tried at Nami. Overall I was impressed and went home happy. The treats were moist and delightful to eat while chatting with company. I will be back for sure. 

- carrot cupcake is a definite winner with it's slivers of carrots
- banana donut takes second because of the real banana goodness it gave off and ! it was topped with nuts !
- peanut cookie was okay, but PEANUT flavor wasn't coming through as strong as I like
- vanilla slice takes last place because even though it was decorated with icing and a small snicker doodle, there was no texture to the cake layers

The ratio of main ingredients in Nami's recipes was perfect so whoever does the baking has something good going on. Many vegan pastries I've tasted give off a distinctive after-taste of poor quality oils. Thankfully, I didn't taste that in Nami's goods. 

On a side note, though, seriously - the icing is ridiculous. Too sweet and way too much! 

One thing that would improve the store is better use of the counter space. Wouldn't it be nice for the owner to invest in a roomier display case?"}
{"text":"In my searching of vegan options in Phoenix I stumbled across Nami that was listed as a 100% vegan ice cream shop/bakery/coffee shop.  Further search brought up photos of indulgent ice cream sundaes called tSoynamis.  We had the perfect opportunity to check out Nami following my birthday dinner at Pizza Heaven Bistro, since it was just up the street.

Not only does is Nami 100% vegan but they also carry many gluten-free options for those interested. Nami is located just next door to it's restaurant counterpart, Green.

The staff was super friendly.  Given so many choices they also gave us a hand selecting our tSoynami.  My husband went with the \"Mash\" which is a mash up of baked goods and other yummy additions of the maker's choice.   In other words a \"Mash\" will never be the same.  He was quite impressed by the tastiness of his treat and I will admit I stole many spoonfuls of his.

I chose the \"Fluffernutterin'\" which contained organic peanut butter, banana, ricemellow fluff and toasted marshmallow flavor.  Definitely a win in my book.

What made our experience even better?  When I saw that our treats were served in a biodegradable 16oz cup along with a wooden biodegradable spoon.  I'm all about reducing my carbon footprint.

Checking out their Facebook page I see that they have Hot Fudge Sundays and Sunday Brunch, both of which I know I will have to check out.  Not to mention, I definitely need to try some of their vegan baked goods ASAP. Vegan donuts exist too!!

The good and bad is that it's a pretty big trek to Nami for us.  Good since I think I'd be there every day.  Bad, that I wish it wasn't that far.  Even so I've  visited Nami 4 times since arriving in Phoenix just under a month ago -_-.  My excuses are that once it was my birthday and the other 3 I just happened to be in the area while exploring all Phoenix has to offer.  Hey, I had to take advantage of my opportunities.

Yes, vegan soft serve ice cream exists and it truly is heavenly."}
{"text":"Nami, oh me oh my! Oh Na- Mi! Nami is one of favorite hidden gems in downtown Phoenix! It's hidden on the corner of the historic neighborhood around Garfield and Coronado I believe. It's also right next to Phoenix Green which is an awesome
Vegetarian/ vegan based restaurant! Good food but that's a different review for another day! Nami also serves as a coffee shop, so get specialty coffee lovely vegan pastries at your service. What they are mostly known for is their yummy donuts and they have an awesome brunch that they do on Sunday's which is superb. But when you go, definitely is try one of their signature tsyonami which is a yogurt based soft serve made with coconut / soy products so all vegan safe! From the cute small interior that's filled with local artists art, and cute little succulents. Nami is a way to go or at least try out, it surely won't disappoint! Ok Arizona stay hungry and keep being cool!"}
{"text":"Omg!! If you can't have dairy and need an ice cream like dessert .. run don't walk to this place .. cute little shop with a long list of tsoynami items.. 

On today's visit I had the life's a peach option with vanilla  soft serve ice cream.. this is a deconstructed peach cobbler in a cup with granola & caramel .. yes please!! 

The soft serve ice cream is organic soy & coconut milk tsoft tserve ice cream and is available in chocolate, vanilla or swirl .. 

I'll be back to try every flavor on the menu .. 

Dessert case had cupcakes, donuts and other yummy looking treats .. vegan friendly!! 

Friendly staff .. tip jars ask Sing in the car or Sing in the shower? I voted car!!"}
{"text":"this place was really hard to find. Once we found it, it was hard to find parking because so many people were there. I got the haystack soynami with chocolate and it was hard to believe that it was vegan. I loved this place and I would come again. The only other complaint, which isnt a real complaint, is that there were so many soynami options that it took me about 10 minutes to decide. Lots of good things, you should come here."}
{"text":"The paradise! You can indulge yourself with so many things... I've been there at least 10 times since i moved to Phoenix (4 months ago eheehe)

The samoan cake is beyond delicius, hot latte with almond milk is really heavenly and for the ice creams... well i have difficulties to name the best because are so tasty all of them... (and I didn't try them all yet, they have such a big selection!!)

vanilla shake and mint syroup... OMG!

This is the Paradise, believe me.

ps. for the parking you can easily put your car on the other side of the road, is exactly in front of Nami... =) plenty of parking spots !"}
{"text":"So, it was just okay ice cream. My biggest complaint was not that. It was actually.... the spoons. I don't want rough wood on my tongue. There I said that phrase out loud, and I would actually not eat there again just because of the coarse wooden spoons. I wasn't the only one in our birthday group that made the, It-feels-like-I-just-licked-a-napkin face. In fact, one of the girls' spoon snapped in two while trying to scoop some of the gummy chocolate out of hers. She threw the almost full cup now with splinter sprinkles away.
I've had better ice cream at Baskin Robbins and made no spoon induced grimaces while doing it."}
{"text":"The fact that I have yet to write my review of Nami should be an insult to vegans and sweet lovers everywhere!

Nami, short for Tsoynami, is heaven on earth. or the moon. jupiter. wherever there is heaven, there is Nami.

Soy \"tsoft\" serve ice cream. Winkies. Snickerdoodles. Various cupcakes. Various cakes. Coffee with a choice of soy, almond, rice, and even hazelnut milk!

Although they have only done it once, Nami is planning on running a regular Sunday brunch in February. I thought it was amazing when I went to the beta test. Multiple scramble options in addition to chilaquilles and other brunch creations. 

Do yourself a favor and stop by. If not for the treats, for the awesome dancing and singing always taking place!

PS... Cheddar and Chive Scone (thank me anytime)"}
{"text":"Making a return after veg-friendly UYE was just what I needed to finally write a review of this place. 

Vegetarians, vegans even...this is your spot for some breakfast, coffee, or for most of us, absolutely satisfying your sweet tooth! 

Dude, everyone loves a tsoynami. There are well over a dozen varieties of this soy-based ice cream. On my last visit, I'd tried \"Kiss from a Rose\" with white chocolate chips, strawberries, and rose water. Divine! I am excited to try the chocolate varieties. 

If you're not in the mood for dessert, there are some breakfast items as well as coffee. 

You're going to just skip to the ice cream to start your day, right? Same here."}
{"text":"Omg! So delicious! I ordered clunky monkey and it has banana, chocolate and pecans! Everything's organic and it tasted light!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been great, but if I could recommend one thing that I believe is better at Nami than anywhere else, it's the yeast doughnuts. These might be the best yeast doughnuts in the world, and the great toppings are wonderful, too."}
{"text":"We were always skeptical to come here because we aren't vegan and it seemed too pricey. But after hearing so many raves about this place, my husband and I rode our bikes here. The ambiance is charming and the staff is genuinely sweet. 
I enjoyed a toddy while the hubby sipped on a chai tea latte. We shared an oatmeal cream, two oatmeal cookies sandwiched together by icing, addicting but a little too sweet for my taste.

Edited-

We finally tried the tsoynami and it was delicious!!!! In our minds we always rationalized by saying we would rather get blizzards at DQ. So happy we didn't this time around. My favorite is the Chai Tiramisu tsoynami and my husband loves the Fluffernuterin. We've also tried the Almond Oy Vey and the cookies 'n' cream."}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite place for egg-less treats!! I walked away with a S'more tsoynami, a slice of the PB&J cake, and a brown sugar cupcake. All were delicious! You don't have to have food allergies or vegan to enjoy these goodies. My boyfriend even thought they were good!"}
{"text":"The donuts are huge, dense and sugary. The prices are definitely higher than a casual donut shop or cafe, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Stop what you are doing and come over here!!
If you are vegan or not you need to check this place. 
Awesome food really tasty and the place is very comfortable and private. There are sitting in the front or privately in the back yard. 
It's worth stopping by cause it is a surprise for any anti vegan/vegetarian foodie 
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and all it has to offer! Me and the fam are regulars every Sunday! LOL. Great staff and amazing food! You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Vegan frozen yogurt. need i say more?! It's fracking delicious, dont even question the \"vegan\" aspect of it. go go go!"}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time today and I'm in love! It's a very hipster place, very nice atmosphere. I got the iced cactus haboob which is a latte infused with cinnamon and agave syrup. It tasted amazing! And it's vegan?! It was $4.50 for a 16 oz, so a little pricy, but then again everything vegan is normally more expensive so I'm not complaining about the price. I didn't try any of their pastries, but they all looked very delicious. Only bad thing about this place was the parking. There's very limited parking, and it's shared with another vegan restaurant next door. I went during lunch hour, so parking was full. I had to park at a restaurant close to it. Besides the parking situation, the rest of my experience was amazing! Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Who would have known that vegan ice cream and pastries could be so good! I'm lucky to say I live around the block from this great little spot. On my first visit, I had the Dough Boy and fiance has the snickerdoodle cookie. Both items we had were delicious. I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"A sweet hub of delicious treats. I love my non dairy swirl! The people who work here are sweet too!!"}
{"text":"The food is SO delicious & it is so nice to go somewhere that knows what customer service is - must pop next door for dessert to complete the amazing experience"}
{"text":"Phoenix Coffee Culture 9/13 -- checking Nami off the list for 9!

This little shop is as unique as it gets and it's Vegan! Before you press \"x\" or that little circle, give the reviews a little read first. From food, pastries, coffee, tea and other specialty items Nami gives dairy using cafes a run for their money. Their menu is punny and whimsical, which makes this place feel down to earth and enjoyable. 

I decided to caffeinate myself with their \"Cactus Haboob\" a Cinnamon infused Agave Syrup latte (iced) and decided to go with their Maple Bar, that was gluten free. I am not a vegetarian, vegan or have gluten intolerance but I thoroughly enjoyed what I ordered! The latte was perfect, I'm the type of person who craves more cinnamon-spice flavor in my Chai (yes, I am aware it contains more spices than that) which is why I went with the Cactus instead of the Chai Latte. It wasn't overly sweet, caffeinated me well and was delicious -- even with Soy milk. The Maple Bar was a typical fried donut, though not as fluffy, but semi-airy. It was actually impressive, though it was a bit too greasy.

Besides the slight greasy donut (kind of expected), the pricing is a bit steep for what it is. $4.50 for my iced drink and $4.25 for the maple bar, a bit too ridiculous for a GF donut IMO.

Beautiful little space, tons of tables and outdoor seating. The cashiers were informative and answered questions customers had thoroughly. It looks like the Tsoynami's are the most popular thing here, I might have to come back to try it and their food. Great place to catch up with friends, spend solo time or to read. No outlets from what I've seen so far though."}
{"text":"I scream, you scream, we all scream for. . . Soynamis! So it doesn't quiet have the same ring as \"ice cream\" but it's still delicious! And you don't feel as weighed down/guilty after finishing a Soynami as you do when you polish of a DQ Blizzard.

The first time I went I had the Almond Oy Vey!, which was good, but not amazing.   Then a friend recommended the Coffee Coco Loco with the addition of Peanut Butter, and it's so good that I can't bring myself to try anything else. If you remotely like coffee and/or PB you will love it! I've never tried any of the baked goods, but I did bring home a chocolate cupcake for my boyfriend one night. He said it was really good (evidenced by the fact that I wasn't offered a bite), but the icing was overly sweet. 

I shouldn't have written this review... now I'm really craving some Nami!"}
{"text":"Their banana tsoynami is amazing.  Seriously, I'm not 100% sure if there is crack in the banana tsoynami (is crack vegan?) but it's that addictive!  

It's a little bit pricey, but who cares?!?  Yum!!"}
{"text":"What can I say,  other than absolutely delicious and  amazing. Everyone is always nice, love the ambience,  and is truly a gem. Definitely take everyone there,  even if you think you don't like non dairy treats- you will discover that you do."}
{"text":"We got the espresso shake and the \"Cookie Party\" sundae. Both were so rich and delicious! The staff is super friendly and enthusiastic about plant-based desserts! Most of the items on the menu are gluten free as well! So glad we stopped at Nami!"}

{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Upgraded my rating from the last review.  Remember that this place doe snot serve ice cream.  It's only 50% of what ice cream should be.  Vegan, so no cream, no eggs.  So make that 1/3 of what ice cream should be.

Tried a new flavor of tsoynami today - the chai tiramisu with vanilla \"ice cream.\"  It was pretty darn good.  The coconut flavor (ostensible from the use of coconut oil) still came through, but so did the chai.  The ladyfingers were replaced with animal crackers that added necessary texture.  I've grown a little more enamored with this place and given how good this one tasted, upgrading to 4 stars.

Parking still really sucks."}
{"text":"Had the cookie dough ice cream and espresso shake (it's not on the menu, but you can request it). Both were good. The cookie dough chunks were HUGE, and the espresso shake was what you expect it to taste like. The portion size for the ice cream is pretty big. One order is share-able in my opinion."}
{"text":"Omg I'm so excited about this little place...I wasn't expecting every thing to taste so yummy!"}
{"text":"NOTHING LIKE THIS PLACE ANYWHERE!!! i always have to get a different tsoynami when i come to phoenix. i crave this year round and look forward to coming back to phoenix almost solely to visit nami. it is soooooooooo delicious. this time i had a betterfinger tsoynami with chick-o-sticks in it. to die for. amazing."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has become this way.  I have been coming here for years and it used to be enjoyable.  Over the last two month's I have come here 3 times and every time I come here there are some super young kids that are working that literally always have the dirtiest judgemental looks on their faces it's very unpleasant when you go to order and people are not even looking you in the eye when they take your money.  And not only have they reduced the cup size of the soy nami by like 40%, they also haven't filled it each time I have come, there has been about 25% missing the first two times and literally half of the cup was empty tonight.. HALF!  But I didn't even bother to say anything because the line was long from them just horsing around the whole time.  I saw some people they seemed to know (?) walk in and they all literally just chatted at the register for a good 10 min, just laughing and joking around.  The people in line were just staring impatiently and the kid says \"oh, we will be with you soon..\" I couldn't believe it.  I get it you want to have fun where you work, I am an advocate for that we spend 80% of our lives working so we need to make it fun, but you are also running a business and you have lost mine.  It's all just about the money now I guess."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out nami for a while now so we finally popped in this past Sunday as we are doing a vegan challenge. They have really yummy vegan desserts! If you are thinking of using the wifi though its pretty spotty but otherwise a great place to chill! On Sunday evenings they have live music as well which is nice."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here the other night. We had an affogato, Nami cake, mint/oreo tsoynami, and 2 soy vanilla lattes. 

The service is really fantastic, and the espresso is very good."}
{"text":"WHOA! Damn good ish here let me say let me say! 

I looked this place up before I came out to AZ and I was so excited and it matched up to what I thought it would be which was.. AMAZING!

I got 2 Lemon cupcakes that had this amazing frosting on top and inside the cupcakes. I smashed both cupcakes at the airport the next day. They were still amazing the next day and moist!!!!! Ugh so damn good.

I came in when they were closing in a few minutes so they didn't have a lot of anything next. I really wanted one of the tsunami shakes ! Ugh they were out I think but if they weren't I am not sure why I didn't order one! I am going to have to tell my girlfriend to go and order one so I can live through her. I will be back for you tsunami... I will get you inside me...! 

For what I had, Nami is boss and they had me at hello. Hopefully we see each other again or I find you somewhere closer to me."}

{"text":"I love me some Nami. Their Haboob drink was my absolute favorite, paired with an everything bagel and vegan garlic and herb cream cheese. The best!!"}
{"text":"The Country Burrito was the bomb. If you've never tried this once you are missing a treat. So stop by and enjoy all they have to offer. Peace

Stopped in or rather decided to ride 20 miles to enjoy one of my favs. I had the country burrito and a donut. Now time to head back home and enjoy the scenery. Peace

Tried the wing ding dang burrito. It was good but what would you expect. My is still the country. I thinks it's the maple that has me hooked."}
{"text":"I've previously had Nami's products, but yesterday was my first visit visit to their location. I love the variety of their products (baked goods, gluten-free options, etc.) and love that everything is vegan! My boyfriend and I shared the PB & Choco Tsoynami which was amazing. It's a bummer that I live so far from downtown or else I'd be here weekly. :)"}
{"text":"I only stopped in to grab dessert and I gotta admit it was a difficult choice but we opted for their chocolate cake, it was a nice big size and felt really dense in the box they put it in. Got home and WOW! I will be getting this cake again, it was moist, chocolatey, and delicious. I'd love to bring some friends/family here that think Vegan things always taste weird because they'd never imagine how good it can be. Looking forward to coming back to Nami and trying out some of their specialty drinks and other snacks. Parking lot was pretty busy and tight but we managed to find a little spot. Just be patient, it's worth coming in.
Been back a few more times & their donuts are Amazing! Also I LOVE their S'mores Tsoynami, wow!!! Always super busy parking lot when I go, of course their food is Insanely dee-lish."}
{"text":"Right next door to Green so afterward I took my boys for \"ice cream\". Fantastic! Still not sure what we had but we all loved it. Price was great too, $8 bucks for all 3 of us. 
I noticed other Yelpers complained about the service but our experience was great. Very accommodating and they even made chocolate chip (not on menu) for us."}
{"text":"This is now my new go-to when visiting Phoenix. Everything is soooo good! My first time here I had the wing ding dang burrito. It was a little spicy but that's how I like my food! The tofu scramble was tasty as well. Although it was breakfast time, I also had the Cookie Monster tsoynami. Being vegan, I don't get to have a whole lot of sweet treats at restaurants, but the tsoynami was life changing. Their McBagel is also very tasty! I am so glad my friends told me about this place."}
{"text":"Always a line out the door for Nami. The food is incredible! Try the vegan Huevos Rancheros burrito. So filling and fantastically yummy! 

Knocked one star off because of the unfriendly girl @ the counter. She barely smiled and looked highly annoyed. The rest of the staff is extremely pleasant! 

Still love the food though and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Dropped in to get a cone while waiting for my pooch at the groomer and encountered a rude family leaving this place... they all tried to get out the door without holding it open, I guess, scared I would expect them to hold it for me.   Once inside, 4 teens came in from the other door and was greeted as I, but were told there was a menu on the counter as well. In the meanwhile I'm looking at the menu hanging above the counter-no biggie... they all mosey to the counter and a few of them started to order while looking at the menu. I moved to the side of them and ordered a soft serve cone. I was told,  \"Sure but I think they were first.\"  \"Thanks, they weren't I was.\" My moral of this encounter, I'M GOOD. I will not be back. It was my first time there and I had a few questions, but seeing and experiencing this, I am going to leave well enough alone."}
{"text":"Nami brunch is every Sunday from 10am-2pm. They always have a special that is announced during the week via social media. They never disappoint! Many baked vegan goods that are to die for. Order an adult beverage next door at Green."}

{"text":"Saw a friend posts photo about this place and decided to give the place a try. The server was very helpful and knowledgable of the menu items. We made it too late for brunch so we ended up trying some of their tsoynamis (cookie dough and cookies and cream). They were delicious considering it was a vegan dessert. Didn't even notice that there was no diary. Also had their cosmic cookie and it was delicious especially mixing it with the tsoynamis!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing tofu scrable here will definitely come back to this cute cosy little place!"}
{"text":"As I never expected a vegan restaurant (Green) to have the best hamburger I've tried, I felt the same about cheesecake.
I almost didn't bother ordering it. I mean it's main ingredients are eggs and dairy. But this was delicious! Sweet but not too sweet, rich, creamy....
I've had cupcakes, Tsoynami's, cookies. It's all good. You can't go wrong regardless of what you order.
I even had gluten free biscuits and gravy here. Just like mom makes!"}
{"text":"Of course I got a tSoynami when I came here after reading about them! Soy-based vegan soft serve with goodies mixed in? Win! I went with one of the gluten-free ones (as noted on the menu), the PB 'n' Chocolate one ... because ... peanut butter. 'Nuff said.

Peanut butter and chocolate is always an amazing combination, of course. They went well with the soy soft serve, although my only issue is that the soy soft serve is not really that soft. I don't know if it was just the batch that I got or if that's how it is because it's soy milk-based and therefore lower in fat than traditional dairy soft serve ice cream, but this was rather icy and gritty. The texture more resembled a sorbet than soft serve.

But still delicious nonetheless!

Service also didn't leave a fantastic impression on me. The ladies behind the counter was a tad busy with previous orders but it wasn't until at least four or five minutes before one of them acknowledged that I was standing there waiting and said that they would be right with me. I don't mind waiting, but I just wish from a customer service standpoint that they would have acknowledged that I was standing there waiting patiently for quite some time."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I am not a vegan but they have the best treats in Phoenix. This is a Coffee Shop and Bakery all in one place.  I have been here a couple times and never disappointed.  They have these sinfully delicious treats called tSoynami.  They use a house-made organic soy based, tsoft tserve ice cream and you can choose your goodies.  I tried Cookie Dough tSoynami and oh my was this good!  You have ice cream, cookie dough and some chocolate sauce.  I am getting hungry just thinking about this.  Soy Captain is another favorite.  Vegan Captain Crunch and strawberries....tastes like you are having a bowl of cereal!  Nami does have a great selection of baked goodies.  They have my favorite Snickerdoodles.  I could eat these all day!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. And one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had. Meat eaters will like the sweets and the other food too. Their coffee looked interesting and unique. Great service from everyone. All vegan."}
{"text":"I wish there was a Nami in San Diego! This place is sooo DELICIOUS! My husband and I loved their vegan berry cake donuts and Tsoynamis. Can't wait to visit Nami and try more vegan desserts the next time we're in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"They have awesome vegan breakfast on the weekends, the chilaquiles are delicious! The coffee and desserts are amazing as well... The pumpkin pie Tsoynami is to die for!! I recommend this place to everyone even non vegans!"}
{"text":"AHHH THE BEST ICE CREAM EVER!! I'm honestly surprised on how it tastes so similar to dairy ice cream. I'm going to make it my goal to taste every tsoynami on the menu"}

Having admitted my fondness for baked goods and a perhaps odd fascination with vegan pastry it was only a matter of time before I visited nami - in part due to the aforementioned interests and good word of mouth from a vegetarian friend and in part due to its location just down the street - but little did I know just how good it would turn out to be...or how many times I'd visit (Three to be exact, the most recent being a breakfast with friends on 12/30/12.)

Owned by Damon Brasch and operated on a daily basis by what seems to be a collection of cute college girls that you might see at Whole Foods or a local Co-Op, most of the things that nami does it does very well, perhaps most surprisingly their vegan take on the Blizzard entitled 'tsoynami,' the rich soy-based ice cream lacking any hint of \"soy\" and fixed with any number of mix-ins, some menu staples and other seasonal.  Available 7:00am to 9:30pm I've had them at both ends of the spectrum and honestly prefer them to any frozen \"shake\" I've had save for, perhaps, the concretes at Shake Shack - the pumpkin was particularly excellent as part of breakfast.

Moving to the baked goods, as much as I wanted to like the donuts I just could not, save for the baked zucchini version and the dense blueberry fritters.  Perhaps it was the glaze or perhaps the actual batter but something about each of them harkened that 'beany' flavor that turns so many off to soy based vegan foods.  More impressive, perhaps due to the intense sweetness or a different glaze, the cinnamon roll was a much better choice, as was the turnover with a light flakey shell, sweet whipped soy, and fresh blueberry puree.

Moving on to the rest - I think it is safe to say that anything nami makes with chocolate is a safe bet - the rich organic tablets behind the bar likely 70% cocoa or better and a dominant flavor whether in a tsoynami, drizzled on a pancake, baked into a moist cupcake, or best of all made into dense \"snickers\" fudge that trumps the original by miles.

Last, and certainly not least, for those who don't want chocolate - and all the more so for those unfortunate enough to be gluten intolerant (the real sort, not the trendy Hollywood stuff,) get the Yankee Doodle - a nearly quarter pound snicker doodle sandwich with dense, creamy filling, that is better than any snickerdoodle I've had elsewhere - vegan, veg, gluten free, or otherwise."}
{"text":"Really great products and really great ideas executed with love and care. The staff are friendly. The atmosphere is fun but relaxed. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"We've never had ice cream this good, and it's even better knowing that it's not cream! Their \"tsoynami\" ice cream concoctions are constantly changing, always creative, and totally delicious! They also have great pastries, including Mexican pan dulce vegan style, which is exactly like the non-vegan version of this traditional sweet bread. We can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"So awesome that they have gluten-free and vegan pastries. I wish they were a little less sugary but thankful!"}
{"text":"Recently I found out I'm allergic to eggs.  I thought my sweets-loving life was over... That is until my friend brought me to Nami just around the corner from my home.
They have so many baked goods that are completely vegan - that means no eggs!  They are good too.  I've attempted to make eggless goodies and most of them do not come out well.  Nami has many selections such as snickerdoodles and chocolate chip cookies.  Most recently, I had a tsoynami with cookie dough and other chocolately goodness in it.  It was one of the best desserts ever!  
I'm happy to know I can cruise over on my bike the next time I have a sweet tooth rather than having to make something myself."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time on 5-3-17.  We shared the Conethugs and Carmony shake.  Weird name but omg, it was so good.  It's a special not always on the menu.  I wish it was but that will just give us a reason to try other things.  The place is very cozy but small inside.  The staff was very friendly, helpful with recommendations and it was very busy.  The parking is limited as they share spots with their other restaurant Green which we haven't tried yet but can't wait."}
{"text":"I'm not even a huge \"icecream\" fan, but holy cannoli! The compost Blizzard-esque concoction was incredible! My husband snarfed the Hostess-esque chocolate cupcake down and said it tasted better than the original! All this goodness without a single animal harmed-yay!"}
{"text":"The Tsoynamis are amazing!! you have to try one! *&^# Dairy queen and others alike! Vegan soft serve mixed with heeps of junk is the only way to go! Their brunch is also quite impressive. They always have a Tofu scramble and hash potatoes accompany your meals, but their meals themselves are quite impressive. I Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a gem in Phoenix if you like sweets, are vegan, or both. I plan to come here on every visit to Phoenix. Mmmmm I wish I could eat their cupcakes everyday."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I've been here twice so far and each time it has been amazing! There usually is never a wait, and if there is it goes by really quick. All the employees are super friendly and nice. The place itself isn't huge but there is a lot of seating for everyone inside and outside which is nice! Also nice, they have restrooms right outside by the entrance! I've tried the doughboy tsoynami and also the PB 'n' Chocolate and they are both delicious! The prices aren't too high but you do get what you pay for! I haven't tried anything else on the menu but everything looks delicious here! I definitely will be returning back in the future!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Actually it's just fantastic. But the service is so bad. I've come here multiple times the past few weeks and still, not one employee has been somewhat diligent. And I'm not one to complain about service, but with each set of employees that we've seen, they've all been pretty bad. Nice, but they use their phones in front of customers (while we're trying to order so we have to wait for them to stop so we can order), sometimes we have to wait for someone to notice us, they spend a lot of time messing around, and it's great they have fun at work but... I just want to get my food and leave. I love the food, so I want to get more, but the employees are too informal and negligent."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the big deal is with this place. It's fine but nothing really tastes better than you can get anywhere else... it just costs more.

It's not the kinda place that you want to go and just hang out as there is nowhere comfortable to sit and it's really small."}
{"text":"Loved the winkie!  Eat your vegan meal next door at Green and stroll over to Nami for dessert."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! As a vegetarian with lactose intolerance it's hard to find places that make sweets that won't make me sick! I've had the donuts; tsoynamis and their cupcakes and literally everything I've had has been beyond delicious. Last time I went I had their red velvet cake, which was too good! They also have great coffee! The only thing I haven't been for is brunch, usually the line is out the door!"}
{"text":"I got the Yodeling Devil dessert. It was a Devil's food cake swirled in with a chocolate and vanilla soft serve ice cream. This concoction was really good. I couldn't believe it was vegan. The only thing that could be improved upon was customer service. The guy who rang us up was like a college stoner guy (nothing wrong with that! Just do it on your own time. Not at work)."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here every Sunday, if I don't dine in, I take it to go..  But today,  I felt as if I'm a regular there, they don't need to treat me as special anymore and that im always going to go back... Today, my nephew and I ordered the sunday special. It was very delicious by the way, the pancakes was amazing. It had brought to my attention why my nephew and I had to share the syrup bottle, instead of having our own. Which we usually do. It was never a problem before. Then my girlfriend and her fiancé showed up, ordered the same thing, and their plate looked better than mine. Not only that they had their own syrup, she had two pancakes and more items on her plate than I did. 

I never complain,  i love this place. I talk about this place all the time, tell them to come here allll the time. its not a huge deal, but it was bothering me. Its not like I was going to eat the whole pancake, but it was the portion control that I didn't get. Why should mine be any different? shrugs.. nami is starting to get well known, busier and probably just half ass everything just to get the customer going and what not."}
{"text":"We stopped in after having some food next door at Green. We got a slice of berry cake and a chocolate soft serve special. I would give the quality of the desserts a 4/5 but the selection and friendliness of the staff definitely deserves a 5/5. I will definitely return next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Its a bit far from where I live, but I love to come here when I can. Multiple employees are actively participating and leading the animal rights activist movements throughout Arizona, so you know this place is legit.  Thier pastries are excellent, and thier food is similar to greasy fast food... but vegan. I want to emphasize that I mean that last sentence in the best way possible. Where is a vegan supposed to go when he is craving something along the lines of a McGriddle (or whatever they call them these days)? Well we can go to Namis, which is awesome. It satisfys the craving for greasy fast food. I just wish they were open when the bars closed! Either way, I wholeheartedly support what this place represents, and I love thier food and coffee. Also that cookie dough cake that you guys made for my birthday yesterday was awesome. None of my family would have guessed it was vegan (except for the part where I ate it, which kinda gives it way).  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Nami is great!  They have an excellent selection of vegan baked goods and some are even gluten-free. Make sure you call ahead if you want some donuts. They go fast!  I haven't tried any of their tsoynami, but if they're anything like the ones  at Green, I'm sure they are wonderful. 

It's a small little place with not a lot of parking, so that can be challenging, but if you are looking for some great vegan desserts this is a good place to go!"}
{"text":"I don't even know how many times I've been to Nami since it opened. It really doesn't matter that it's 30 minutes away from my house... I make up reasons to go weekly.

An update on the \"Here's what we ordered\" section:
1. Cinnamon roll -
A classic. They heat it up for you so that it's too warm and fragrant and irresistible not to finish. It's perfect. I hate it. I hate them. (That's a lie.)
2. Chocolate cake doughnut - 
Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I'm pretty sure that this is just a ring-shaped piece of chocolate cake. That said, it's a very good piece of ring-shaped chocolate cake.
3. Sugar cookie - 
I brought this home for my very non-vegan little sister, who tasted it immediately and said, \"This (nom) is the best (nom) sugar cookie (nom) I've ever had in my life!\"
4. House made granola, yogurt & berry parfait - 
Nami's granola is like cocaine. You will never be able to have enough of it. But that's okay, because on some mornings it just feels right. I do wish the yogurt wasn't soy-based and the berries weren't frozen, but honestly, it still rocks.
5. Vegan Victory Bar - 
If you're looking for something more wholesome, this peanut butter-chocolate-spirulina (hence the green color)-nut-seed bar will satisfy your sweet tooth without making you feel gypped for picking the 'healthier' option.
6. Hazelnut milk latte - 
Any of the lattes from Nami are fantastic. Choose coconut, almond, soy, hazelnut, or rice milk for a strong, nutty cup of awesome (and you can sweeten it with Stevia!)
7. The MASH - If you're feeling daring, this is a fun way to spin the wheel of dessert fortune. I've ended up with a carrot cake tsoynami and a mint chocolate chip one. Both were delicious, but nothing beats the Monsoon.
8. Brownie -
Literally the best brownie I've ever had. So chewy-rich-intensely-chocolate-y. It didn't even taste like there was flour in it. I want a hundred of them. Right now.
9. Peanut butter bar - Don't be intimidated by this dense looking log. It's actually a light, crunchy, nougat-y bar with a thin layer of chocolate on top, although it does resemble peanut butter fudge.

The thing is... I've never had brunch here, which means I should probably head back on Sunday to get a feel for it. Now there's an idea."}
{"text":"I absolutely love nami! they offer so many so many vegan options which is great if you're like me and you can't eat dairy ;) I especially love their vegan donuts, and they always have new flavors to try. be warned though: they're not like krispy kremes or other regular donuts, because they are vegan, they are much more dense, and coupled with the fact that they are pretty large to begin with, you fill up rather quickly. so you don't need to buy more than one... or maybe two ;) the only downside to this place is that it's very laid back so there's really no sense of urgency in the employees, making time an issue. for example, it took 20 minutes for them to toast a bagel.. that being said this place is still the vegetarian cat's pajamas."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed about the changes they've made. I used to live in Central Phoenix very close to nami and enjoyed coming here. I moved to another part of town and don't get a chance to get out to nami as much as I wish I could. 

I went this weekend for the first time in probably a year. First the guy behind the counter asked if I wanted chocolate or vanilla. I told him I never had the chocolate since it wasn't an option when I lived nearby. He just said \"it's not very good\" so I decided against trying it. Then I was sad to see that they reduced the size of the cups but the price didn't change. But THEN they only filled my new little cup about 2/3 the way with product!?! I feel that I got around 1/2 the normal portion I used to get for the same $5. I was happy to see they ditched the weird wooden spoons and got plastic. 

Overall I really enjoy this place but feel that they are now overcharging for the portions they are giving. Also some of the \"special\" flavors on the board haven't changed in 3 years!"}
{"text":"The bad thing about Nami is that everything is so amazingly delicious, deciding what to get is very difficult.  Nami is a 100% vegan baked goods/ sweets/ breakfast/brunch spot, which is owned by the same person who owns the Green New American Vegetarian restaurants. It's located next door to Green's PHX location. 

BRUNCH:
Served Sundays, 9a-2p. Arrive early or prepare to wait in a long, winding-out-the-door line. Try to be savvy by calling ahead (as I have), but you'll still have to wait in that line to pay for your order. 

My favorite brunch items from the regular menu are...

-Biscuits & Gravy. Fresh biscuits smothered in chorizo gravy, topped w/ chopped green onions. It is so good! It comes with papas and tofu scramble (try the scramble with salsa or Sriracha sauce!), plus fresh and sweet pineapple wedges to cleanse the palate. 

-Wing Ding Dang. Their famous spicy/buffalo \"wings\" (they really aren't that spicy, IMO) served with papas & scramble. I like it naked (aka as a plate instead of a burrito).  My carnivorous family loves this dish too.

If you wanna be fancy (*singing* I'm so fancy!), mix it up, or add it up, rather. Because I like the Biscuits & Gravy + the wings, I usually add a side order of wings to my B&G meal for only $5 more. 


SPECIALS:
They feature a different brunch special every Sunday, which is ingenious really; it keeps things fresh, and keeps the customers coming back. I'll be thinking, \"Oh, I'm going to stay at home this weekend.\" Then, BAM! They'll post pancakes or the Flying Saucer as the special and all my plans have to be rearranged. The great thing about the specials (aside from them being, well...special) is that if you fall in love with one (and you shall!), it will likely be featured again sometime in the future.

My fav specials, thus far...

-anything with pancakes. Be it the Grand Slam, blueberry pancakes, etc., they are ALL delicious. I do wish they'd add pancakes to the full time menu.

- (I'm going to butcher the name) The Flying Saucer Full of Secrets? It's a Mexicana breakfast pizza w/ chorizo, black beans, hominy corn, guacamole, lettuce, enchilada sauce, papas, & scramble (I omit it, but cheese & sour cream too), atop a crispy fried tortilla. IT. IS. SO. DARN. AMAZING! It's huge too! Share it or save 1/2 for later (it warms up pretty good if you take off the guacamole first; no one wants hot guac)

-DaeDae's \"Chicken\" & Waffles. A vegan take on a southern classic, and they nail it!

-Bad @$$ Texas Summer Tacos (that's really the name!).  Tacos stuffed with fried avocados & refried pinto beans. Yum!

The only thing I'm not a fan of is the grits. Maybe I'm just a little too southern for these new fangled grits.  People who like them seem to love them. See for yourself.


BREAKFAST:
It wasn't alway so, but they serve breakfast, Mon-Sat, from 7a-11a, so the Biscuits & Gravy, and the Wing Ding Dang are now available daily! 

My favorite among the new breakfast items is the Country Breakfast Burrito. It's a big ole thang too!  Organic scramble, tempeh \"bacon\", papas, peppers, onions, & syrup (sans vegan cheese for moi) stuffed into la tortilla. Such a great and super filling breakfast! 

OTHER:
Aside from meals, there is also a plethora of baked goods from which you may choose, including various tantalizing donut flavors (these donuts are as big as your face!), cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pies, etc. I only drink water, but there is a humongous list of coffee/cappuccino, tea, juice, and vegan milk options. They have a (very) few vegan grocery items too. 

Look out for the Nookie (ask about it!) & Sunday sundae specials! Live music sometimes. 


TSOYNAMI:
NOW let's talk about the Tsoynami! Vegan soft serve, originally in vanilla, but as of 07Aug14, they introduced the CHOCOLATE TSOYNAMI! AND you can SWIRL (chocolate & vanilla)!

My FAV Tsoynami creations - 

From the regular menu

-Soy Capitan - vegan Captain Crunch & strawberries mixed in. Berry cool!

-Dough Boy - chocolate chip cookie dough & chocolate syrup mixed in. YUM!

-Cookies n' Cream - Newman's chocolate cookies + chocolate syrup. Classic!

From the \"specials\" rotation
-Chocolate Monsoon - chocolate cake + chocolate syrup mixed in. HELLO!

-Orange Creamsicle - orange magic + icing (you heard me!) + whip cream = heavenly dreams that taste like childhood summers. 

-Raspberry Beret - raspberry & cream cheese pastry puff & raspberry puree mixed in. AMAZING! (I may or may not have been singing Prince's song whilst indulging.)

MY CREATION - pretzels, toffee nut, chocolate syrup mixed into the soft serve. Create your own too!


If you don't want all that extra, you may eat the Tsoynami plain (think spiral soft serve) in a cup or cone. They can drizzle some of their naturally flavored syrups on it too, if you'd like. I recommend the caramel, toffee nut, and chocolate syrups. 

A cup of Tsoynami is a LOT of ice cream. If you'd like to share it, tell the cashier and they'll split it up for you.


Nami for all!"}
{"text":"The s'mores ice cream is very good. Tasted like I was biting into a s'more. I really like their milk shakes too. I am pretty fond of anything coconut and most of their treats seem to be made with coconut milk. I live for this veg/vegan option #lactosintolerantlife"}
{"text":"I use to love this place but the last few times the customer service has been the worst. Just tonight, we walked in at least 15 minutes before closing and there was a line if people waiting for ice cream. Randomly, the lady walks out and says \"we're not taking any more orders\" after we've been waiting for 5 minutes looking at a menu. She was so rude, not even a sorry...I can take my money elsewhere! We walked out and it wasn't even their closing time yet. Rude rude rude and poor customer service all around. Serve the people standing in line, close the door at closing time."}
{"text":"This place was so amazing. I had a vegan dirty chai doughnut with an iced chai and it was delicious. The staff was really nice and friendly. Cute atmosphere. At first I was confused where to park but there is parking in the back of the building. If you're vegan/vegetarian you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious and soulful vegan food with lots of variety! I go here when I am in the area with my vegan friend and I love their pastries or we might head over to Green next door. The hot wing breakfast burrito is fantastic! I got theae lemon poppyseed donuts that werd delectible! Really great vibe, the staff is fast and friendly.  The place can be a bit pricey for my taste however its pretty comparable to other places like this that i have been This place is always popping especially on weekday mornings. If you are looking for a sweet vegan spot in the area you have to check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, most recently for brunch! I've been meaning to try their breakfast items considering how much I love their tSoynamis and Green. 

The set up is a little confusing. I didn't realize that you have to order at Nami, but have the choice of sitting there or at Green next door. We opted to sit at Green, since there's much more space. One of my friends who is a strict vegan, suggested the biscuits and gravy-and almost everyone in my party ordered it. I haven't had biscuits and gravy since going meat free a few years ago so I was pretty excited about it! I also ordered their pumpkin spice mocha. It tasted like a holiday in a cup. So, so delicious.

Our order arrived not long after we got our table at Green, so service was quite quick! Our food was quite tasty! They have the market cornered on that dish! I can't find another place that has a vegetarian friendly b&g! Even my boyfriend who is a big meat eater thought it tasted good! The scramble was alright, I think I expected it to taste more like eggs than the veggie taco meat that I make at home (we're probably using the same seasonings-who knows!) It was still good, just not what I was expecting. The potatoes were phenom! Perfectly crisp on the outside! Yum.  

Looking forward to a return visit! Green and Nami are two of the best vegan spots in the area!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing! We grabbed some food here last night before a concert, we live in San Tan Valley, and have zero selections out here for healthier/vegan food..we are about an hour away, everything was perfect, I really wish we had a place that gave a damn about real food and people like me and my family that give a f**k about what goes into our bodies."}
{"text":"I was introduced by a friend and got a \"banana cream pie\"! in love forever! I also love the red velvet cupcake! (when its in stock). Service there is usually always nice and prompt, this evening the girl working wasn't as friendly as I am used to the other girls working there but that isn't going to make me rate less because I am addicted, muhahahahha!"}
{"text":"First time in....like an idiot! Omg, the heavens parted and blessed me a vegan apple fritter!!! I cannot tell you how long I've desired this unicorn of the culinary world. They're $4, but big enough for two people. Topped it off with a pour over with exclusive in-house vegan creamer for $2.50. ummmm hi hello. Perfection. Staff is awesome. \"Gonna eat em all, RAPTURE\""}
{"text":"I needed to update the review as the BF and I rode bikes here yesterday to get a dessert (clearly we needed a reward for our exercise :-P). We got the Elvis cupcake and it was just not good. The frosting had crystals in it....like sugar crystals I guess.....it was grainy and too sweet. The cake was bland. It was just not good at all and very disappointing. Also, if you get it to go, they put it in a cup with a lid, which is fine and kind of a cute idea, but ended up in a smashed cupcake due to the bumpy ride home.  I guess the coffee is still good, but I was just unimpressed yesterday....I can't say I would go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Oh the donuts, brunch items and coffee. The food is all around good, cool music playing and very chill vibe."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of cool, hip coffee places and to find a place like this in PHX was gravy! 

After finishing up a road trip vacay of the four corners states, a much needed iced cold coffee back home to Los Angeles would be nice. Especially when your in this Arizona desert heat Nami can't go wrong and thanks to my trusted Yelp search this place made me feel like hipster home.

Parking can be tight here and we ended up parking at the rear. There is a rear entrance way to get inside if you are parking from the backside of the shop. Why I like hipster joints like these? its because many offer different types of coffee in their special menu, not just ordinary and I like the cool savvy ambiance. 

It was on a sunday here close to brunch time it was packed here, and hell no we are not getting out this line! Patience is worthy here trust me. Looking at their menu on the wall they do have an impressive variety from deserts, hot coffee or cold but most of all its Vegan powered here! 

We ordered the Caramel Mochaito and the Cactus Haboob ( not sure if its spelled exactly right )  but their specials had names like \"the Mash\" among others. Im not sure what our iced coffees had in them but the name says it all and what really matters is the taste. Our drinks were $5.00 each. which is cool, you gotta remember VEGAN.

The staff here are pros because we didn't wait too long for our orders and the place was busy. After taking a few sips of our drinks, it wasn't overly sweet with any sugar rush or any of that coffee bitterness, all I can say is that both our drinks tasted smooth especially the Caramel Moch. I had was silk as Dove chocolate and the Cactus Haboob was cool and refreshing like Freddy Flintstone's Cactus Coola.

Checkout their other desserts here they look eye candy and promising.
I highly recommend coming to Nami and to do away the Starbucks! Think Vegan!"}
{"text":"cute and yummy place for vegan friendly desserts. i had the peach fruity tSoynami and it was super light and refreshing and only $5. tasted just like froyo. the staff is very friendly and helpful so don't be scared if it's your first time. perfect spot for a date or to hang out with friends and they have cool art for sale."}
{"text":"I honestly really love this place!! It's often the place i pick to go for ice cream when it's my turn to pick. I am not vegan but this ice cream blows me away! 

I feel the prices are very reasonable for a vegan place. I usually find vegan places have way higher prices but it's nice i get quality for a good price."}
{"text":"I've ordered the tiramasu soft serve twice and it is soooo good.  It does not taste vegan."}
{"text":"i am so happy to find this place! everything is vegan and there are even gluten free options. i got some coffee themed ice cream and a gluten free granola bag to take home but it didn't last long! (i miss that granola) we also tried this vegan gluten free cheesecake WOW! all the employees were super hip and FRIENDLY! great time thanks for providing vegan treats to phoenix"}
{"text":"Get the Soynami!! Get the Soynami!! Get the Soynami!! You definitely will not regret it! Do the smores one with chocolate \"ice cream\" and you will love it!"}
{"text":"Teeny tiny little space that holds some of the most delicious guilt free treats this side of the Mississippi.

Peanut butter and chocolate bars, tsoynamis, snickerdoodles. vegan cheesecake, all amazing.

I hear a rumor that they have a breakfast burrito that I may have to go get for breakfast today.
Seriously, the best vegan desserts anywhere, ever.

Parking and seating are a little tough on weekends since the space is so small and they share a parking lot with Green."}
{"text":"Yummy big, ole burrito. Very flavorful. The location was somewhat dreary and dark. I expected a bit more pizazz from such an esteemed restaurant in the vegan community. Overall, I was very happy with the food and service. :)"}
{"text":"Love the Tsoynamis and excited they are downtown! Beautiful cupcakes, cookies, vegan twinkies! I can't wait for the vegan caramel apples. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Saturday, the ice cream is delicious!! I got the dough boy and my husband the pb and chocolate...it was amazing. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I didn't come away feeling very satisfied mostly because I'm cheap at times. I spent nearly $7 on a cookie and a \"winkie.\" The winkie was good but it wasn't *that* good. I was sorta sulking about that and didn't think I'd go back. But alas, on my next visit, I got one of their Dairy-Queen-like \"Tsoynamis\" and damn if that stuff isn't crack. I went back a second time in four days because I had to have some of that cream, non-dairy goodness. I had a PB-Chocolate one and more recently a 'Smores one with marshmallow fluffer. Good stuff. I like the coconut milk better in some ways. Anyway, I have to be careful around that place but I mean that in a good way."}
{"text":"Need to try their desserts, however the breakfast burrito menu specifically the huevos rancheros burrito was by far amazing!"}
{"text":"Very fun place!  Vegan ice cream is such a novel idea, and they do it well.  I had the chai tiramisu tSoynami and my sister had the almond oy vey.  It was my birthday, so she let me swap with her because I liked hers a lot better!"}
{"text":"Not even being vegan or a vegetarian, I love this place and occasionally go out of my way to eat here. The faux meat is the best I've had, especially in the Wing Ding Dang Burrito.

A must-try place for anyone just looking for good food!"}
{"text":"We got a small vegan and gluten free chocolate cake for our small elopement ceremony and WOW! So, so, so good. We have come to Nami several times for coffee and donuts but have never tried the cake. I'm gluten free and my husband is vegan, so not the easiest feat to find something special for our wedding. I'm a pastry chef and I wasn't thrilled about making my own cake, so Nami it was! Delicious and beautifully frosted. A perfect end to our special day!"}
{"text":"Mine eyes hath seen the glory of this vegan bakery,
It indulges my most tender taste buds decadently,
If I lived a mile closer, I'd have a huge belly,
My mouth is munching on!!!!!!

10 stars. I may have a small sense of patriotism towards the Green/Nami powerhouse being vegan, but there are no reasons to take away stars. More like lots of reasons to add stars. The interior at Nami is small, quaint and humble. It overflows with hipsters and yuppies alike not to mention hard rockers and tree huggers. Everyone who is anyone can find something delicious here regardless of the wear and tear of your converse shoes or how long you've been working on your sleeve. If you have the ability to raise a hand to your mouth carrying a donut, you'll leave happy.

We came for Sunday brunch and were filled with too many \"mmmmm\"s to count. The tofu scramble was perfection and those wings are seriously wing-ding-dang good. The bevvies are delicious and it's probably doesn't even need to be mentioned that the tsoynamis are the best and surest way to fight the 105 degrees outside. Can't wait to come back and get my birthday cupcake here."}
{"text":"Oh nami why? I have a sweet tooth and this place definitely satisfies it. My favorite is the cookie dough tsoynami. It doesn't taste vegan but is. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Why oh why can't we have a Nami in San Diego. Sigh.

I make sure to stop by every time I am in town. Although other places attempt vegan desserts, only Nami really nails it. Be sure to try the Sunday brunch! The Benedict Arnold will have you craving more.

Today I tried the Tsoft serve and it is just as delicious as I imagined it. Their donuts, cupcakes, and cake are the best vegan treats I have had...and I have tried my fair share of vegan desserts!

Great job, Nami. Now all you need to do is open a location in SD."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I wanted to like this place. It was a busy Saturday morning and the line was out the door. Nami itself was packed and the cashiers were working as fast as they could. So my group and I decided to try the breakfast spot next door - only to find out they're closed and they help Nami during the weekends. Okay, great. So we'll wait......In the blazing sun, I waited outside as room inside was made available for me to come indoors and actually look at the menu. I was disappointed. Not only with the lack of venue space but the speed of service was slow along with the small sizing of the vegan baked goods. I spent $20 on 3 items and a chai drink. I think that's a bit overpriced, even for a vegan cafe."}
{"text":"The only thing I EVER get at Nami is their Soynami.  I don't like or eat vegan food, and I think it's blasphemous to have vegan cupcakes sitting on their counter, but whatever -- to each his own.  But the Soynami is delish!  You get the benefit of a whole cup of soft serve without feeling heavy afterwards.  I always get the vanilla with fresh fruit (bananas, peaches, strawberries and mangos).  Sooooo good, especially on a hot day!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. I cannot believe it. It took a girl 15 minutes to pull a pitcher of coffee out of the refrigerator and put it in a cup. That's all I ordered. An iced coffee to go. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night after hearing all these great things about this place! I had the mash and better finger! Both were amazing and I was generally surprised that I enjoyed vegan ice cream! I would definitely recommend anybody looking for healthy ice cream and a great sweet snack to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Even if you don't have dietary restrictions, Nami is worth a try. It's a cute, small shop located right next to Green. They share the same parking lot. Parking can be a bit tough, so try going on an off time.

I had a chocolate chip cookie, which was pretty good - a little dry, but the flavor was there. They have some food items and soy ice cream, as well as coffee drinks. I'd go back to satisfy my sweet tooth after a meal at Green."}
{"text":"Honestly, I probably love this place too much! After learning of some food intolerance's I was so excited to find a coffee shop/bakery/brunch place so close that I knew wouldn't have dairy, since all the products are vegan, and have a good amount of gluten free options available on top of that! My mom and I are obsessed with any of their chocolate gluten free donuts, their strawberry cheesecake is divine, and the tsoynamis are so amazing and refreeze perfectly! Their coffee is also just as delicious. Their caramel mockiato is my favorite, but now that I have cut back on sugar I always get a cappuccino which is still very yummy (the taste of their coffee/espresso is scrumptious). All the staff are very friendly and the environment is very relaxed and welcoming."}
{"text":"Truly the best vegan desserts in town. Without question! The cookies are yummy, the peanut butter chocolate bars are epic, and the tsoynami are reminiscent of a Dairy Queen Blizzard- except made with soy or coconut milk ice cream and way more delicious. On my last visit I had the banana cream pie flavor with vegan vanilla wafers and it was SO COLOSSALLY DELISH! I adore this place. To the owner(s): Please branch out & open up a spot in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Nami is our favorite Phoenix vegan bakery/brunch spot. The coffee is always really good - I consistently order a hot almond milk latte and my bf gets the cold brew. The cold brew is minimally tangy/acid and has a smooth caramel undertone. Donuts are always good, but the weekend selection is much better than mid week. Sunday Brunch has a different menu from the rest of the week, and it is amazing! Most recently we visited on a weekday and I ordered a delicious breakfast kale salad with homemade seed crisps with a cashew sauce in the side. So much flavor. My bf got the Wing Ding Dang burrito filled with 'wings', avocado, tempeh, and other crazy good fillings. We're lifetime subscribers to this place :)"}
{"text":"By far some of the best food in Phoenix, AZ is served here.  Their food is well prepared, fresh and always delicious!! Excellent place to fill up on even if your in a bit of a hurry.  Stop here and try it, you will not regret you did."}
{"text":"Such delicious ice cream! Perfect spot for amazing food with dietary needs like gluten free and dairy free."}
{"text":"I love this place! My family and I always come in over the weekend ...i recommend the dough boy tsoynami! the dough is to die for! The lady with the short hair is great, she knows alot and was very helpful when I couldn't make a decision on what to get."}
{"text":"tsoynamis (which you an get at both green locations too) are delicious!

my boyfriend thoroughly devoured all the other goodies we got with me barely getting a taste - but they were pretty good! especially the butterscotch marshmallow squares.

they also make donuts on weds and sunday - i wish we could have tried them!"}
{"text":"The Vegan ice cream is soo delicious!!!  They have such interesting flavor combinations.  I'm not even vegan but I loved the ice cream so much I had to come back before I left town!"}
{"text":"If you're going to close at 2pm instead of 9:30pm the least you could do is update Yelp so that we don't drive 30 minutes to find a closed shop!!! Was hoping to pick up some treats before my flight and now I'm left with nothing."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to go after enjoying a Big Wac (aka best vegan burger in the world...believe me, I travel a ton for work and have tried many) next door at Green Vegetarian (literally next door, same parking lot). I've tried all kinds of things from Nami and everything has always great (e.g., vegan twinkies, donuts, etc.). The item of praise this go around has to be the soft serve ice cream, for which there was a 25 minute wait--that's how popular it is!  If you're in town a few days, Green Vegetarian and Nami are a must."}
{"text":"This was such a cool vegan spot to try out! My dad and brother got the chocolate brownie shake with berries and we all loved it! I'm more of a \"what's the special?!\" Kind of lady so I had the orange dreamsicle and it was amazing! No dairy and I would've never known. The place is small and cute and has tons of great treats to try!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Best Vegan spot in Phoenix.  My wife and I have driven from north Phoenix every weekend, totally worth the drive.  Friendly employees, great atmosphere and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Returning to the Coronado neighborhood and have already made Nami our \"couple times a week\" stop! Whether for coffee, chai, pastries or vegan ice cream, it's a perfect little hipster joint for a break in your day that all your friends - whether paleo or vegan - will be perfectly happy at. 

Simple 60s mod dining room, groovy eclectic music. The crowd is chill, with a steady influx coming & going regardless of the time of day. Blue haired college girls w/ their bearded boys, multi-generational families & LGBTQ couples -- everyone's seems at home here. 

Check out Nami!"}
{"text":"This place is a great option and concept for some people. Food looks great and is homemade which justifies the prices in this market space until more competitors come into, which I do not see happing soon. Staff is stressed and needs to take a breather and see how they can improve the customer service. That is the only negative with this place so be prepared for it. I hope they can adjust for their demand and improve getting everyone's order out in a timely manner and not just a few, along with a friendly attitude. Good luck to the staff take this as a constructive review. I wish you complete success, support your locals."}
{"text":"Oh NAMI!!!   I love you so much!  It's hard to even convey in words how much I love it there.  I'm there for Nami Sunday brunch almost every other week and it never disappoints.  Nami is the best vegan breakfast / brunch place in existence and I recommend it highly to not only vegans, but to anyone who loves good food with a nice atmosphere and friendly, hardworking staff!  On a scale from 1-5 stars, Nami is an 11!"}
{"text":"yaaayyyy!!!! A completely dairy-free dessert zone!!! EVERYTHING here is vegan, even the insanely delicious truffles! (I had rocky road....I almost melted and went to chocolate heaven right there!) 

The Tsoynami's are outrageous! I haven't had 'soft serve ice cream' in a looooooong time...(figured out I was allergic to dairy like 8 years ago..it's been a while!) ...I had coffee coco loco, mmmmm......(writing this review is going to make me leave out the door right now for some more....)...My family ordered the clunky monkey and LOVED it (they are all dairy eaters, so, I think that says a lot!)  

I can't wait to go back and try some cupcakes, and get me some more of those truffles.....SO GLAD there is another location near me!!! (or AM I???)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised how awesome there food is! I'm not a vegan myself but I do love tofu and fresh food and this place makes the best vegan burritos that even my baby boy loves! The burritos are pretty big so they are filing and their other dishes look awesome. I'll be coming back to try more food!"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of the delicious Tsoynamis! I got the butterfinger one and omg so delicious!!!!!!! My goal is to try every flavor!"}
