{"text":"haven't been in years ,the  only reason is price. I don't think that pizza for two with a glass of wine is worth a hundred bucks with tax and tip .Again the only reason I don't go is price and I can easily afford to go but I already have one rectum and don't need to have another one carved buy the restaurant. I worked to hard for my millions and im not about to give it away. the pizza is great. Enjoy but not me or people I hang with"}
{"text":"Really good food. Good service and quiet space. The pizza thin crust and homemade and very good. Very good spot if you are looking for a good Italian this is a good choice. Expect to pay about 40$ for a full meal."}
{"text":"We went for a business dinner recently.  Here's what we had!

We split the ceasar salad (meh), pizza (so-so) but the gnocchi was AWESOME!  Soft as pillows, the gravy was lip smacking good, we could have ordered another dish of it.  Skip the tiramisu. 

I know everyone loves the pizza here, and methinks we ordered the wrong type of crust.  The waiter told us to order the regular crust so we did.  But within minutes, I saw tons of thin crust pizzas coming out of the kitchen for other tables.  Next time, I'll be ordering the thin crust pizza and the gnocchi.  

If you drive, go early because there's literally 2 spots in front of the restaurant where you can park your car.  One diner nearly got a ticket because his car was half on the sidewalk.  The waiter burst outside to stop the cop from giving him a ticket.  It was like entertainment with dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza; had thick crust and was yet still very light and perfectly crispy/soft.  Had Green Olives on one of the pizzas; overpowered the pizza next time would opt out on them.  Must try place for any pizza lover."}
{"text":"Very limited parking, there's probably 2 parking spot in front of the restaurant. The service was great, I tried the famous pizza, however was let down because the pizza resembled too much of pizza huts deep dish pizza that was overly expensive. Would not return."}
{"text":"I think the mistake I made when I visited this restaurant was not ordering the pizza. Instead, I got the seafood risotto, with seafood that tasted quite terrible, and as if they were on the verge of going bad. The rice itself was decent, but quite frankly, did not live up to the expectations I had for a 20+ dish. However, on my way out of the restaurant I did smell a really delicious aroma which I presume is the pizza, so if I do return I think I would stick to what this restaurant specializes in as opposed to being adventurous. Honestly I would have given this restaurant a 2 star if not for the kind service. The waiter heard that we were celebrating our friend's birthday, and was kind enough to bring us a complementary tiramisu to share along with a birthday song for the birthday girl. Sadly, the tiramisu was also a really disappointing dish, but hey it was free and it was the thought that counts right?
Overall, I'm sure there's better Italian places out there, but I've never tried the pizza so I can't say whether it would justify making the trek out here if you live further away."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but the pizza still holds up and the food the family ordered was excellent. Parking is little to none so you have to park on a side street. A little pricy is why I didn't give it a 5 star."}
{"text":"It was one of the best pizza's in Toronto.  Pricey and delivery takes well over an hour.  Last time I ordered from them, the pizza was dry, salty and tasted like it was previously frozen.  I used to be a big fan, but will have to look elsewhere for a good pizza."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and it was very quiet. The server was so friendly and helpful, the pizza (we got thin crust) was so great!!!! We got their sausage and Swiss cheese salad which completed the meal amazingly!!! Great quiet and romantic environment!!"}
{"text":"great food, a liitle pricey,,,biggest downfall (NO PARKING)......but  i would at least try the pizza at least once, maybe its worth the hassle...."}
{"text":"From what I understand Camarra's is one of the oldest pizzerias in the city and let me tell you, it is by far the best.  Though it's not as authentic as newer places like Terroni etc. their sauce and crust are unbelievably good.  It's a little pricey but it's worth it.  Yes, there's no parking, but you can park in the lot next door.  Staff are courteous and there is a nice patio in the summer.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this restaurant; It was highly recommended by friends. The pizza could easily be compared to a good store bought pizza. Hardly any flavor. The environment was old and stuffy and the parking lot had about 4 spots but all of which were taken even though the restaurant was empty. If you are in a wheelchair, make sure that you use the restroom prior to visiting as this restaurant has no accessible bathrooms and the wait staff had no answer for me; I had to actually use the restroom at the Petro Canada on the corner. Zero reason to go, less than zero reason to go back."}
{"text":"We have been ordering Pizza from here since the 1960's.   Other than homemade it's the only place we would ever order pizza.

Their pizza is outstanding.

You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! 
Not a single bad thing to say about this restaurant  . . . of course I highly recommend the pizza, we get it topped with red onion, garlic and mushroom but I have also just had it plain, with pepperoni and vegetarian.  Always cooked perfectly crusty on the outside but doughy and soft on the inside. I have also tried many items off the regular menu, the caprese salad is excellent with generous portions.  Pasta is also nice but pizza is where this restaurant really shines. 
Inside it's not exactly trendy but it has an authentic feel.  The parking lot is an absolute nightmare but they offer free delivery to a limited area."}
{"text":"Not sure what these positive reviewers had... but we had the worst pizza ever here. It was literally bread and cheese, we hardly had any sauce. Wanted to like this place since it's close but nope won't be going back"}
{"text":"Have mostly ordered delivery from here and they never disappoint! We usually get our pizza thin crusted/ well done, with pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. The seasoning is on point and the sauce is perfect for the pizza. Going to the restaurant may be tough due to lack of parking but it is honestly more enjoyable at home with friends."}
{"text":"Had popped in here for a quick bite when was meeting with a client.  Great little place with awesome atmosphere and the pizza was deeeelish...

Portion size was great and got a belly full of food to carry on with the day..."}
{"text":"The GOOD is the food which was tasty pizza and I mean VERY tasty.  The atmosphere was nice too-authentic old school Italian restaurant.  Which also has good acoustics. Now for the BAD-. The food is extremely overpriced
 2 pizzas that were called grande but were actually 12 inches and a small salad and one soft drink,. NO coffee and no dessert and NO ALCOHOL produced a bill of 80 $!. Another negative was the parking -almost nom existent - impossible for customers with impaired mobility. Last time I was there was 30 years ago and I may wait another 30 to return because of the prices and parking."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for mediocre pizza and small portioned food. Sorry, but you can spend your money elsewhere."}
