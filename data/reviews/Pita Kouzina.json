{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch and were pleasantly surprised.  The food was fresh, tasty and prepared quickly. What used to be an old My Fat Greek Restaurant has turned into a new favorite. Pita Kouzina is off to a great start"}
{"text":"I love this place! My family and I love coming here, the staff is friendly, the service is great, and the food is DELICIOUS! I try to order something different every time we go in, and I am never disappointed. My favorite dish at the moment is the Spanakopita. The portions are very large, so I do always leave with leftovers which is wonderful because that means I am getting more bang for my buck! If you are in the mood for fresh, flavorful, and satisfying food then I highly recommend Pita Kouzina!"}
{"text":"I had the kale quinoa beet salad. Had enough to take home..my daughter tried my leftovers and went down to order her own. It's that good. We will make this a regular."}
{"text":"Sadly, Pita Kouzina closed permanently on April 27, 2015.  I was a regular there from the time it opened as \"My Big Fat Greek Restaurant.\" My family and I would eat there weekly and got to know many of the staff.  It's sad to know it's gone."}
{"text":"After the transformation from Big Fat Greek Cafe, we decided to give it a try.  The menu is mostly the same but the bar is mostly gone.  Since none of us are big drinker, it isn't a big deal but we were told that the coffee machine was down so there is no Greek Coffee.  The portions for Gyro Platter and the Calamari, plus a lunch portion of Chicken Pita  were extremely large so neither one of us could finished..It isn't the greatest Middle Eastern Restaurant but it is decent and the service was friendly.  He checked on us several times and see if we are completely satisfied.  We got a great value for what we got"}
