{"text":"I have been here several times and I dig it. If you can understand the concept it is a really fun space. It's a food hall so you have 5 different food spots to choose from plus a coffee shop and a bar. The cocktails are made with fresh ingredients and the beer selection is stellar. There are inexpensive options at the bar and food stalls and happy hour rocks. There is ping pong, giant Jenga, cornhole, and now they have added board games. And, they seem to have events all the time. My favorite is team trivia!! If you can't understand the concept of this progressive space that is a shame. You are missing out."}
{"text":"This place is really great, having different restaurant concepts under one roof with plenty of seating makes this great for groups."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place! I've been going at least once a week since moving downtown. The desoto burger is to die for, I tell anyone who will listen about it. All the bartenders (but especially Brian) are not only friendly but make the best cocktails I've had in a long time, and the cocktail of the day is always delicious and only $5 during happy hour. 
I have yet to try any of the other food from the \"booths\" behind the bar but I've heard good things. The coffee shop has some good sodas in fun flavors, the pomegranate soda is good with rum (I bought it and mixed it myself at home). There's also tons of seating around the bar and upstairs for hanging out, surfing the Web, playing cards and eating alone or with a group of friends. 
I highly recommend this place for anyone who likes fancy burgers that are always cooked perfectly, good drinks and chill places to hang out. As far as I'm concerned, Desoto is the crown jewel of Roosevelt Row."}
{"text":"OKAY so I went to the desoto market to study and I specifically came here because I know they close at 12 so I was getting my study grind on. Drank tons of coffee and had my headphones on- totally in my zone. If you've been here before, it's normally pretty dark and dimly lit upstairs. I didn't realize that the whole market frickn CLOSED and I was sitting up there and didn't know!! I took out my headphones and I was like wait why don't I hear people... they still had the bar music on so I was like okay.. maybe theres just not a lot of people here and I look down and theres absolutely NO ONE THERE. I got up and left like within the 2 seconds I realized and I ran out of there. It was only 11:02 when all of this was happening. I ran out of there because I figured I was the only one there !! I got into my car and literally two minutes later I see someone closing the doors to the market. Do you guys see what I'm saying here ?! 
Not only did she (the woman who was closing up) fail to do a walk thru of the place to make sure no one was there, but she closed early when the sign specifically says they close at 12 on Sunday nights! My study session was cut short and I had to find another place so late at night. I love this place and I always come here but after this situation, I really hope someone from their management team sees this and does something about it. This was so ridiculous. 

Imagine if I had gotten locked inside! 

As frustrated as I am, this is probably something I'll laugh about later but I hope that someone is held responsible for this."}
{"text":"Two visits and both time atrociously under-staffed bar. Twenty minutes do get two beers and then to add insult to injury they told people with tickets for drinks before 8pm to jump the line to redeem them. How do Phoenix places last so long with such poor staff scheduling?"}
{"text":"The DeSoto Market is awesome addition to Roosevelt Row and downtown.  The design and space is awesome, and I can't wait until all the vendor spaces are filled out.   The only area I see that may need some improvement is the the patio.  Such a big space and so much potential, however in its current state it feels a bit disjointed, cold, and the lighting is way too bright at night....with some furniture arrangement, more greenery, and a lighting designer, it may be one of the best in the area:)
BTW, the bar does make a mean manhatten!"}
{"text":"Desoto has a growing selection of artisanal foods. Its a little expensive and a lot trendy, but overall the quality speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Full C note per hour for community room usage.
So let me understand. Empty, cooled unused, lit space, is running $100 per hour to the community for use. Ummm what community are they trying to reach?

The refuge has free space. Thx"}
{"text":"Got too hard to bring friends and family, couldn't get food at the same time and my family was getting too confused and overwhelmed. Haven't been in like months so I am hoping they have fixed the issue but just wanted to be honest, not a great place to bring a group. or maybe give it a try and decide for yourself. Better if you go with your one pal or guy/gal, sit at the bar and order a burger cause you can do all of that from just your one barstool!"}
{"text":"As a frequent business traveler and someone who works in the commercial real estate industry I always find some time to visit places like these.  The idea of repurposing historic buildings into creative uses rather than tear them down always impressed me.  This place has the right idea but they've got some work to do before they become a landmark.  

Looking at previous yelp and tripadvisor reviews Desoto is all over the board.  Some love it, some hate it and some don't understand it.  Seems that most of the negative reviews have to do with poor service and/or lack of variety among the food vendor choices.  I have no doubt that with time Desoto will iron out the wrinkles which will make it a staple for locals and a 'must try' for tourists.  After all, it appears to be the only venue in the Phoenix metro area trying to do what they are doing.  I hope they realize this and can capitalize on it.  

They did a great job of rehabbing this building - some missteps but all-in-all, very nice.  Next step is securing more tenants.  They need to fill this place up with artisan food vendors and the foodies will keep coming .  Right now there's just not enough culinary choices to keep the average epicure interested.  Additionally if they could combine more variety of local vendors with a selection of fresh produce and a deli that serves up quality meats  then that, my friend, is when The Desoto will have hit a home run!  This is what works for similar concepts in other large cities.  Had a great burger from The Larder + The Delta and pretty good cup of coffee from Tea and Toast.  

This place is worth a try.  I'll be stopping by again on my next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place was really cool and had a great atmosphere and friendly staff! I got an iced honey vanilla latte and it was pretty delicious plus the music they were playing was of great selection. Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Totally cool place.  5 restaurants (and more on the way) with different concepts.  Mix-and-Match vibe means you can feast at the raw bar while your friend gets a burger.  Then you can share the cauliflower from Yard Bird+Larder (hint: this is a MUST!) when you both meet at the bar having a drink.   Or you can order together and wait while the staff brings you some delicious food.  

It's on the light rail.  And the parking is ample.   

Some Yelpers have complained about the \"confusing\" structure.   Come on!  You're a grown up. It's easy!   Other Yelpers have complained that service is slow.  News flash: cooking competent food is slower than the speed of light.   Take a breath.  Savor a drink.   Have a conversation with the friendly staff.  And wait just a few minutes for a yummy meal.  

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Awesome place if you like variety  Different cuisine, its like an upsacle food court with an awesome common area.  Outside sitting courtyard has an outdoor bar and great place to eat and socialize when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"For Phoenix, this is a great spot. If it were any other market, it would've failed already. Having lived in NYC and spent time at Chelsea Market or even Eataly -- this place has a long way to go. It has plenty of seating but poor offerings, however, the main bar has good drinks and the coffee shop is great. I've tried the Burger Joint and the salad place (Radish?) and both were sub-par. The food, across the board, is average. They need to focus on using the space (lots of under utilized space) and creating a food scene that is 1) good and 2) fits their scene. Right now, it's just kind of awkward."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out in the Roosevelt historic district. I've tried the Adobo Dragon - Asian fusion, specializing in Boa, or steamed buns. I needed gluten free that they were happy to accommodate by making my pork and chicken into street tacos that were very tasty and came with a few bites of kale salad, but it was a bit pricey for the portion size. Despite the price, I will come back again. Also tried Radish, great selection of salads and fresh juices, perfect for vegans, and/or gluten free and good portions."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for DeSoto and am disappointed by the extraordinarily slow service (are all of the servers doing a student internship?) and the failure to open most of the food courts that are needed to make this space useful and fun. Furthermore, the space has not been finished in a physical sense. For example, there are no shades on the large glass west facing windows which provide blindingly bright sunlight in the afternoon and early evening. Really! Just do it!"}
{"text":"Love this concept. Good beer, great opportunity for local food geniuses to exhibit their talents, and welcoming staff. This is the future of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The bartenders are remarkably terrible, but with an arrogant attitude as if they are untouchable. it's very strange walking up to the bar, having the bartender see you and then slowly wander aimlessly around the bar before circling back, taking the order, forgetting it, asking it again, returning to verify it a third time, and forgetting place your food order. (This scenario happened four times in one evening amongst six friends.) 

I've had various items at the different carts- all of which seem overpriced and under seasoned. 

The atmosphere is pleasant and has open space. The parking lot is convenient. This establishment has the potential to be quite amazing if the service and food work out the kinks and master the execution."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. I had an awesome Patagonia salad. Friendly staff! great booze! Coming back again!"}
{"text":"Love me some DeSoto, especially if I: need to get work done or want a lunch that won't leave me feeling like I have a medicine ball in my gut.  The building is an amazing relic and provides the perfect space to disappear into whatever you're working on.  Because the food options are more, \"you go to the window,\" than \"the window comes to you,\" you can be left completely alone for hours on end.  Although I'd still consider it a work in progress when it comes to the food, market options, but it is supposedly still in development.  I'd love to see them improve their social media presence and a some sort of clear direction to visitors when they enter.  I've had more than one person tell me they looked it up and was confused about what it was or what it offered, so the skipped it.  That's a shame considering how wonderful the place is.  Also, when you walk in, it's unclear for newbies what you do, or can do.  I've seen more than a few people walk in, look around, look confused, point at the building interior in admiration, and turn around (probably going to Angel's Trumpet or Carly's!).  But, all told, this place is a gem, and I expect it to continue to grow into the neighborhood meeting spot!"}
{"text":"Bar is nice. Burger was bland and fries were flaccid. Don't bother with the food, but it's a good place to drink."}
{"text":"The vibe seemed great, but it seems to end there. I bought a $9 beer and then went into the \"food court\" area after purchasing my beer and ended up buying a burger from \"The Burger Joint\". I ordered a burger with a fries and also asked for a ranch with my order. So the order came out and the girl forgot the ranch, so I asked again when she brought my order, and again it never came. Then I go to the window and let them know I'm crabby about having to come and get my ranch and the lady says that the ranch should be tasty enough to help with my crabbiness. Well, it wasn't, and the burger was sub-par, and the fries where a little oily. Wouldn't waste my time coming to this place again, especially when angels trumpet is so close"}
{"text":"Gosh this place is cool. I wish more people knew about it. Warehouse with a community of businesses is a fantastic idea. Food, festivities and funky vibes check DeSoto Market out!"}
{"text":"TURN DOWN THE MUSIC!!  I'll never return.  I went in expecting to find a relaxing place to have a coffee and instead, left with frazzled nerves.  Why is it that so many places nowadays feel they have to blast out your eardrums with shitty music probably only the staff likes?"}
{"text":"It's like going to \"urban\" mall food court we got bad rude service! Just wow!!  So excited to check out this place :-("}
{"text":"First time at Desoto Market. What a fun venue.  Monday is happy hour till it closes.  Delicious double patty burger for $5.  And fresh cut fries.  Accommodates number of different sizes of groups upstairs and downstairs.   Love the architecture and friendly staff.   Going back soon to try some other food."}
{"text":"Super cute place only reason I'm giving this place one star is we went there on a Friday night at 10:40 pm and they refused to serve us. Normally they close at midnight, but they said they had a slow night so they decided to close early."}
{"text":"Fun place, great atmosphere, good drinks and yummy food! I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience yesterday, and mainly because of customer service. I've tried bringing my mom here twice now and both times something has been going on and we haven't been able to go in... Yesterday I showed up just after 2 and found out they were closed for an event... after explaining to one of the employees our dilemma, she kindly offered to quickly make us drinks, and then treated us to a tea latte- the best I've ever had! It's this over the top customer service (in addition to the yummy beverages) that will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Very cool place! Spacious and a lot of food and beverage options. True definition of a hang out place."}
{"text":"Desoto market is a place I was going to love, until I stepped into the building and the decor with its \"nod\" to segregation decor made me feel like I'd time warped to the 1960s and I needed to make sure I didn't try to use the \"Whites Only\" fountain. That feeling didn't come initially, but me and my husband stopped at Desoto on a Saturday Morning. I was headed to study at the library and he was going to run errands so we figured we'd grab a cup of coffee and a bite to eat before starting the day. 

There is plenty of parking available, which is a plus. The red brick of the building is beautiful and the glass outer walls allow natural light to flow in. It's abut confusing trying to figure out everything happening when you first walk in, so we decided to explore before ordering anything. There were vendors setting up for the day in the large space in the enter and only one of the restaurants was open for the morning, the other owners were just setting up for the day. We decided to walk around upstairs and when we got to the staircase by there was a sign that reminded me of segregation, but I told myself I was crazy and proceeded upstairs. 

I arrived at the bathroom and since I was touring the building told my husband I was going to peek my head in. When I came back out, I didn't see him so I turned the corner and immediately saw the water fountain which confirmed my earlier feeling. He was halfway down the stairs and I went to go ask him if he saw the fountain, he commented that he didn't like how the sign looked like it all it was missing was \"Whites Only\". We walked around a while longer, brought some caramels from a vendor, and then settled on just getting coffee. 

This is where the 2 star review really begins. After speaking to the barista, we both ordered drinks she recommended and then it became painfully clear she had no idea what she was doing. My tea was burnt and somehow grounds from the espresso she added ended up in my cup. I attempted to salvage it by converting it to a sugary concoction full of cream, all of my attempts were in vain. I threw it away. His coffee which was supposed to be one flavor, came out another, but it was drinkable. We were going to order food but while standing and waiting to place our order were told what they didn't have available and that eliminated the options we actually wanted to try.

This experience was about 3 months ago and I haven't bee back, except rotate pictures of the signs and fountains so I could randomly poll people to see if I'm just crazy, or if it really is segregation redesigned. So far, about 85% of respondents unprompted, have had a similar reaction and asked where I took the pictures."}
{"text":"This review is for The Burger Joint here only. Order:2 Cheeseburgers, 2 orders of fries and an order of nachos, after waiting 15 minutes and seeing the only cook slowly wandering around the seating area I went back to the counter and saw our meal hadn't even been started. I asked if I could at least get my nachos while we waited. He looked towards the grill area and proceeded to tell me the cook hadn't started them. And there was no cook there. I asked if the cook was working. He said yes so I asked if when the cook came back could I please get my nachos first. He said yes. 15 minutes AFTER that we get cold nachos and our meal. 29.00, 30 minutes later, about 4 people in the entire area and 2 very bland cheeseburgers later we decided never to return. It was obviously clear customers don't matter here. 
Save yourself some time and money and go to Shake Shack down the street where the food is much better and customer service is good!"}
{"text":"I love Desoto Central Market and all it has to offer; however, The Provisionary does not have good food. 

The fried chicken drips in grease. The moment you take a bite into it all the oil spills out of it. It's also bland and just disappointing, some salt would go a long way with this one. 
The mac and cheese is alright, the texture is good but there is no cheesy goodness to it. When I eat mac and cheese I want to taste the creamy cheese.
The biscuit is alright but reeks in bleached flour and the cornbread is so salty. The cornbread has no sweetness to it. 
Lastly the honey butter is not honey butter at all, it's just cubed unsalted butter."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome. Love that it's very open and they so many different eateries to choose from. My fave is definitely Walrus & The Pearl! Yummy oysters and seafood creations. A drink you MUST try if you're there is the Diamonds and Pearls from the main bar. It's delicious! I can't stay away from this place, they never let me down."}
{"text":"Open market place for craft shopping, and craft eating.    Alcohol and coffee bar on one side, and about six eateries on the other.  There is an upstairs which is more just open space, restrooms, and public meeting space that looks like it can be reserved.

Good food options that range in variety such as fried chicken, burgers, new american craft, Latin/Asian fusion.  Luckily we were with a large party so we ordered lots of food, and able to sample just about everything.  It's nice to have a variety if everyone can't agree on one specific cuisine, good experience, but nothing that I had I thought I would have to come back and have again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of DeSoto! I love that they have different events throughout the week, some free and some that you pay a small fee for. I especially enjoy Tea & Toast, which has amazing tea lattes. Also, I just recently came for an event that was held during happy hour, so I got to enjoy a nice glass of wine. The happy hour specials are pretty good plus the customer service is great here. I haven't tried the other food options, but i'm looking forward to sampling some of the other vendors and see what that they have to offer."}
{"text":"Came to just get three basic iced teas at their coffee shop stand and they never have it available or brewed and try to charge you $5 for a pressed tea made hot to pour over ice lol. I'll take my business elsewhere as the baristas are always rude and think they are making you a medical potion to save your life and they never have everything available.  This bait and switch on basic tea needs to stop and I hope other customers don't let them charge you $5 for an iced tea either."}
{"text":"Love this new place! Radish is my favorite. Will definitely have happy hour here one day too. The community dining & bar area is great. Cool industrial design. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First of all the facility is great! We ordered $13 burgers that were thinner than McDonalds...Really dry and expensive but the bread was good. We ordered iced tea which were $5 each and nothing special. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE and hate this place. My wife and I come downtown on Saturday morning for coffee and bacon jam toast... Yea, BACON JAM toast. Then we can just hang on the patio until brunch. 

This is a concept that plays on the Ferry Building in San Francisco. Big warehouse, by Phoenix Arizona standards, and lots of restaurant concepts to choose from. 

They've obviously put a lot of money and time into this place, but the only reason I can't give it a better rating is the lack of organization. Each time I've been in I've loved the food and hated the nonchalant attitude of the owners and staff. It's not like they don't care, but something's not quite there yet. Love the toast, not the 15 minute wait on the toast when they're not busy.

Jerry Springer final thoughts: get downtown to visit this place. Have some coffee and bacon jam toast, stay for their incredible burgers and light summer beers on the patio, but don't expect perfection yet. Looking forward to updating this review sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I love coming here on Sunday's. It's not too crowded. Food is beautiful-good AND Mr. PHX lays down some of the dopest sounds!"}
{"text":"Three stars for now, it's a good concept, the execution isn't there just yet though.  

Best description is an upscale food court, only a couple of the vendors are up and running as of 12 April. I tried \"yard bird\" had the low country perloo it was ok, like I said it's a good idea and the wheels are just starting to move, I hope they start hitting their stride soon."}
{"text":"All of the times I've been to Desoto I've enjoyed something different at a different place & haven't had any issues parking, service, value or cleanliness. The décor is great mix of vintage & urban. This place hit the mark. Definitely need to try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Well eight months ago I was here and I came back- no improvements. This time I tried the hamburger spot . seriously disappointed. Whenever anybody is going to make anything with bread it's about the bread. that bread overwhelmed the hamburger and just made eating it difficult. I was with two other people who had the same exact experience. Tried the coffee bar what terrible service terrible attitude of  the,server. I ordered a muffin that was labeled  blueberry  and I got raisins . When I pointed this out to the girl  at the checkout  she gave me the worst attitude in the world like it was my fault it was labeled wrong . Never again . The only upside to anything as they have pretty decent parking (free).  This place isn't cheap and for the amount of money that's being spent service is the name of the game I can buy a burger and get a drink anywhere.  Step It Up DeSoto"}
{"text":"I hate giving this place a subpar review, because I genuinely applaud the concept, the vendors and the space. For over a year now, DeSoto has been one of my favorite spots to come and study or hang out at. There is a lot of seating between the 2 levels, the wifi service is good and the bathrooms are clean. Also, the design of the space itself is very aesthetically pleasing with the large wall of windows facing central ave and the brick and exposed piping throughout the rest of the interior. I have had food from all but one of the vendors and have never been disappointed. The reason for neglecting to give a full 5 star review is because the last couple of times I have come in during the day, there has been a parking lot attendant who follows me to my car making small talk, and then before letting me leave asks \"how far is baseline road\". I gladly tell him how far it is, but then he will go on to ask for money for a bus pass to get there. This has happened twice now within the last 2 weeks and the conversation has been literally the same. I was caught off guard by it the first time and felt obligated to help him out considering how casual our conversation was. When he approached me again the second time I was mindful of what he might say and was shocked that he had apparently not recognized me and presented the same series of questions and follow up questions. I'm not sure if management is aware that this is going on but I personally find it very strange and could potentially be turned off by the establishment entirely if it continues to happen."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the coolest hangouts in Phoenix. It really made me feel like I wasn't in Phoenix. 

Excellent tap list, amazing food options from their cafeteria style eateries in house, patio seating, live music, full bar, coffee shop. You could spend a whole day here."}
{"text":"Been here before, and went to Walrus and the Clam! That place is to die for!! Brought my sister and it was closed! Think we got there too early. But def try again some other time. Awesome vibe, every kind of food you could want. We ended up leaving cuz we wanted sushi but I'm gonna bring her back again some other time for sure! Located in artsy downtown Phoenix and the upstairs is totally chill! The place is the coolest!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the quality of food for the price. We tried Adobo Dragon, excited about the Asian Latino fusion they offered. We tried the chicken bao (2 pcs per order for $9.5) The buns were moist but the flavor of the chicken & the mango salsa just didn't work for me. We also tried the salmon bento, salmon was overcooked and there were just too many flavors going on in the bento that didn't really \"fuse\". It's like, the bento had an Asian corner and a Latino corner, then a corner with fresh fruits. The brown rice was dry. The Posole chicken noodles was the biggest disappointment. The noodles were instant... that alone was enough to ruin the noodle experience. Our total bill was $35 with 2 drinks and we left unhappy and dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Very cool space and a great concept. It's definitely a unique spot and should be much more popular than it is. Great food for one and the service has always been excellent in my experience. Prices at each of the available options are certainly reasonable."}
{"text":"What a cool place!! We are sitting outside on the patio, the service is very friendly. Love all the open space inside.  The food is wonderful."}
{"text":"Nice open area, free wifi, friendly people! I had breakfast toast when I went there for a change of scenery (I work from home) and it was delicious. Got a salad to go for lunch from another spot, equally delicious."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Came with a bunch of coworkers for lunch. Wide open warehouse with food stalls. Each one is order/pay separate. While it looks like a place that would cater to the local work lunch crowd, at 11:30 on a Wednesday it was dead and many of the stalls had closed signs. It would also be nice if there was someone or maybe a sign to explain the concept and what there was. Didn't really want to wander around to much and figure it out or why nothing was open. We all grabbed food from different places. I got curry noodles from the latin/asian place. They didn't have many drink sections, looked like coke bottles, green tea cans and bottled water. Each place had different selections so you would have to pay at a different place if you wanted something different to drink what they had. The burger place was open and most people ordered from there. The burgers looked good but the fries that I snagged from my coworker were not good, I really didn't know fries could be bad but it was almost like they were hollow. It was odd. Lunch for a noodle bowl with some veggies and 3 shrimp was a little prices. around $18 for the ice tea and small bowl. It is a neat concept and we will give it a try again, probably not if we are in a rush though, all the food came at different times and some took quite a while despite there being hardly anyone there."}
{"text":"This place is like a big food court and each business has it's own specialty food.  Its got a great vibe and the food here is amazing.  If I lived in the area I would come here all the time to eat.  The food is fresh and delicious.  I believe it is also a venue so check out their hours before coming here so you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I agree, the space is cool. Very neat concept. The rest is left to be desired.

Went on a Saturday morning just before 11am as the website said they open at 6:30. Well, I was unclear that there were so many different food shops in here - so each must have a different opening time. Anyway - not sure what you can get at 6:30am or what is open. But thought there would be a brunch crowd, and apparently this is not the place to go.

I was excited to go here in the first place to check out the local artisans - and low and behold - there was only 1 set up and wasn't really interested in chocolate at 11am. There is no schedule when vendors will be there on the website, nor on the facebook page, so I guess you just have to guess. 

As well, there is no menu online for the DCM Burger bar, I didn't try the others, but given it's walk-up food for the other 2 vendors that were open (juice bar and Adobo) it was pricey for food-court style food. Either way, there is no consolidated menu under the DeSoto Central Market website for all the restaurants or for the artisans. 

Sat at the bar - and was told we had to wait 6 minutes until they were open to order food. Um. Ok. We ordered burgers - my $12 bacon and blue did not include any sort of side, and overall was dry. Ordered fried zucchini on the side for and additional $4 - and received flavorless hunks of cornmeal battered zucchini and yellow squash. There aren't many options to order food from the bar and none of the rest of the vendors offer beers or drinks - so I guess this is where you go.

The mixed drinks are pricey - $12 - draft beer - $6 (few local selections - missing Kiltlifter, Orange Blossom, 8th st or something!) The beer selection is not great. Walked out spending $51. for 4 beers, 1 burger and fried zucchini. Not impressed.

I sincerely doubt I will be back for food. I would definitely like to check out some of the vendors if my psychic abilities start kicking in and I can figure out when they are there. Other than that, I would skip it."}
{"text":"As most diners have stated, it's a great concept but needs someone to explain the concept to newcomers. Is it a food court? I think so. Takes a full visit to understand how the DeSoto works, down to what to do after you are done eating. A hostess at the door could take care of this awkward first take. My food was ok, Curry Noodles, tapas that included meatballs & wings with a canned ice tea. Meatballs were the best of the meal. Freshly made would be much better. My mates enjoyed their hamburger and Po boy with fried chicken skin. It seem just going to the bar would have been a better choice for me."}
{"text":"This concept reminds me of a classy version of the dining halls on my college campus. Well... minus the all you can eat, but plus alcohol so it evens out! There are 4-5 unique restaurant concepts, a bar with craft cocktails, and big open seating. It's the perfect set up for a quick lunch if you live or work downtown or a casual meeting spot among friends.

I did the latter this past weekend with 3 friends before joining a larger group to go out in downtown. We had Adobo Dragon's Bao meal and a veggie spring roll both were great. The Albondigas Bao, a meatball mix of beef and pork, was the standout for me. The drinks were on point as well, a mix of your usual domestics, craft beers, and some cocktails using surprising ingredient combos (like mezcal and hot sauce) that all seemed to work well as standalone drinks but also with the style that DeSoto is going for. All in all, DeSoto is a  place I will certainly be returning to when I am looking to ease my way into an evening in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Interesting concept and beautiful building!  Had brunch there a few weeks ago, before many of the vendors were set up, and loved the variety and seating   I had a grilled cheese, bacon, and egg sandwich with fries and iced coffee.  My friends had burgers from the same place

So, there are some areas of improvement,  My meal cost $15, too pricy for a self-service joint   It's a great place to have a drink or coffee but I can't see it drawing the fine dining crowd or the value conscious with the combination of this ambiance and pricing 

Still, I admire the restoration of this beautiful piece of Phoenix history and wish the owners luck in this endeavor.  You may want to consider Happy Hour pricing and additional discounts to build repeat business ;)"}
{"text":"Eh. 

The idea of DeSoto Market is cool but the execution is where it falls short. It's similar to other markets i've visited in Seattle and other cities and I see where their inspiration is coming from but its just not doing it for me. The vendor choices are pretty limited and nothing really sticks out as something I'd really want to chow down on and in fact, the food I did have from one of the vendors was not very good at all. 

The building and decor is nice, but they could improve by working on some sound dampening as it gets pretty loud when busy. Overall I just feel like its a lackluster experience.

I'd go again, but only if I was meeting someone/it was someone else's idea, this area has way more to offer then DeSoto."}
{"text":"Had the burger at desoto. Juicy Lucy with a side of zucchini. Burger was good size and the bun was fresh and delicious. The zucchini was cut a little too small for my taste... I'd rather have bigger pieces to hold and bit into. 

The reason for the 3 star? First, the juicy Lucy is not your classic juicy Lucy with the cheese inside the patty. In fact I don't honk mine came with cheese at all. Second, both the burger and the zucchini was over salted. Very salty. I like salty and spicy food, but this was even too much for me.

Now this was my first time here. Maybe I just had a salty patty and salty part of the zucchini pieces. Maybe the cook likes salt. Who knows."}
{"text":"Super chill hangout spot with games, both board and outside games, great selection of food a good bar and a DJ on First Fridays. If you haven't been there then this is a must!"}
{"text":"Just left here and my Dad ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich From the Burger Joint which they forgot his Blue Cheese, Didn't give him Parmesan Fries that he ordered & paid for, then to top it off his chicken was Raw but he didn't notice until he was half way done eating it.Praying he doesn't get sick because it was my idea to come here after the Chinese Culture Festival!"}
{"text":"So many good food and drink options. Extra friendly staff. Very cute shopping choices. Live music was the perfect touch. Totally coming back. Just wish they had A/C!"}
{"text":"The service is out of this world.  Amazing knowledge of cocktails, as well as beers and the like. I had an amazing time! Shelly is the most amazing bartender. She really took the time to make my experience amazing."}
{"text":"First visit last night (it was a Monday, so things were quiet, but not deserted.) Off to a great start. The space is beautiful. A bartender at the burger joint welcomed me and my wife and explained to us how it works, which I appreciated. It's like a fancy food court. Apparently some of the ample empty space is going to be filled soon by the addition of a farmer's market produce stand and a butcher stand, both of which I look forward to. 

We started off with a dozen oysters at the oyster bar, and they were very, very good. Had three varieties, all very fresh. It's too bad this stand doesn't offer vodka (could have gotten some at the Burger Joint bar and brought it over, I suppose) but it does offer wine if you want. Good start with the oysters, regardless. 

Then most of us went to the Southern food stand. (My wife held out and got a burger.) Two of us got the pork belly, and one got the shaved catfish. The shaved catfish I tried was tasty, but not as tasty as the pork belly. The portion of pork belly is not huge, but for $10 I got plenty to eat, and it was so delicious. The greens at the bottom are really well cooked too, tender and flavorful, not too bitter. My wife got a burger with a fried egg on top, which was good, but paled in comparison to my pork belly. Also the egg was cooked hard, instead of being left a bit runny. 

We had a bunch of cocktails at the bar. (Beer selection is very good too, but we stuck to cocktails.) I especially enjoyed my Moscow mule variant (forget the name) which was delicious. The $5 cocktail special was a pineapple cucumber mojito, which was delicious and did not skimp on the alcohol. Too bad they ran out of it. I also had a 1928 cocktail, which sounded delicious but was just okay. 

Overall we had a great time and really enjoyed our food. We'll be back, probably often."}
{"text":"Food is decent but overpriced. I got two very small food items and one also-small beer, and it cost me almost $23 including tips. Crazy! The Cajun place is the best out of all of them. Burgers were a huge disappointment according to my two friends who had them--save your money and go to Five Guys instead. Great space but not for eating...."}
{"text":"I love hanging out here because of the variety! There are a total of six restaurants to choose from: 

- DCM Bar/Burger Joint: The bar and burger joint are on opposite sides of the market, however they connect in the back to work together * I.E. I ordered a special Bloody Mary from the bar that comes with a burger, bacon, and a pastry on top - which is cooked at the Burger Joint! I strongly suggest coming to the DCM Bar to try this Bloody- it was so good, almost like a meal because of all of the extra stuff on top. Burger was on point too.
PS. They have plenty of board/card games to choose from, which we love because we are disgustingly competitive. 

- The Larder + the Delta: YOU GUYS THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD OMGGGGGGG It reminds me of home! I am from Georgia, and I have to say that this southern food is on POINT! We came here and ordered the Louisiana Chicken Biscuit- probably the best biscuit I have ever had in my life. Needless to say, we are coming back here to try every single thing on their menu. The chef, Stephen Jones, of TL + TD was actually the first executive chef at Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails in Downtown Phoenix. Jones, keep doing what you're doing. I like where your head's at.

- Tea & Toast: Your cutest little coffee shop- breakfast (all day) options are available (generally healthier options- ex: avocado toast) as well as small pastries/cookies. I've been to this coffee shop a few times and I have to say- they're pretty great but they slack a little when they're making their lattes, you'll probably have to add an extra shot of espresso to get the coffee flavor or it'll taste like milk... Most commonly known for their Black Rose Latte and Lavender Latte. 

- Adobo Dragon: Latin American + Asian fusion- mostly known for their steamed buns. Try the Beef Bao! 

- The Walrus and the Pearl: This is really sad- I am a big time oyster aficionado and I haven't been here yet! They have a great selection of chilled or cooked seafood options- big focus on the oysters that are on display at the bar, where there are a few seats available! I'll have to check back in and tell y'all how I liked it.  

- Radish: Salads, wraps, bowls, fresh juices and smoothies. Nuff said. Healthy AF. 

Overall, I think this is a GREAT date night spot especially if you can't decide what you want to eat! The concept is really cool since you can walk around, choose from any different restaurant and sit wherever you'd like.
*Free parking in the neighboring lot and behind building 
*Easy access from the Valley Metro Light Rail 
*Free Wifi"}
{"text":"Really really excited for this place! I went  there last night and had a salad from Radish. It was delicious and I loved it (wrote a more detailed review on their Yelp page)! 

The building looks amazing, and even though it's not finished yet, I was so excited to see all the \"Coming Soon\" signs showing what else is going to be opening up in there. The vendors that are still in the works are an ice cream stand, a Niman Farms butcher/sandwich shop, a florist, a produce stand, and possibly even more that I'm missing. This is in addition to what's already up and running: a coffee shop, an indoor/outdoor bar, Radish (salads + juice), Adobo Dragon (Asian fusion), Yard Bird + The Larder (comfort food), and DCM Burger. So much cool stuff going on here!

All that said -- I wish the vendors gave the option of having your food \"here\" or \"to-go\". I understand part of the appeal of this place is that it's a food court where you can order your food and take it wherever you want. However, it feels very wasteful to have them package everything up in disposable containers when I'm merely walking to a table in the same building, where I'll then be eating it. PLEASE give a \"eat here\" option, where the customer's food would be served on reusable dishes like at most restaurants. I like having the option to get it \"to-go\" when I need to, but realistically, I'm sure I'll be eating most of my meals in the super cool dining room or patio.

Once all the space is being fully utilized with different vendors, I can tell this place is going to be incredible! I can hardly wait. I do hope management will strongly consider my suggestion to serve food on dishes if the customer will be eating their food in the building."}
{"text":"Great concept! We loved the salads and hummus at Radish. Friendly service. Relaxing vibe. Great cocktails."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I went in on a Sunday and was told they stop serving The Kracken (Bloody Mary) at 4pm. Which is fine, but the bartender was somewhat acting like he was annoyed that I didn't know, but there's no sign that states that and on the menu, there's no note on there either. So just to confirm I asked if it was the same for Saturday(s) & the answer was a ruin yes.. I figure maybe he was having a bad day because asking two questions about your workplace, shouldn't be a crime.. 
So I decided to go back on a Saturday and ordered drinks from different bartender, now all a sudden The Kracken stops being serve at 3. I'm just over this place & the fact that they still have the item on the menu & an advertisement on their wall still.. Makes no sense.. They shouldn't continue to advertise something that doesn't exist anymore...
It's just a Bloody Mary with extra garnish, being from the Midwest, they are popular and I just wanted to treat my hubby to one. It's just frustrating to go to the same place twice and be told a different answer everytime. I could probably go when they open and they would say something like it's too early to served an item."}
{"text":"I want to loooove this place...but it's hard to when I don't feel a really compelling reason to return.  Parking is a hassle.  The place is big, cavernous, and not exactly welcoming.  I like the concept of several restaurants in one big place, and the food I've had so far is great, but the whole process is rather non-intuitive and chaotic -- most likely because it is so new.  I'll come back in a couple months once they've worked out the kinks. :)"}
{"text":"Such a cool spot! I lived in downtown phoenix 10 years ago and there was nothing cool going on. This place makes me want to move back! It's like a food court for foodies. The person who takes your order makes your food right in front of you. We tried something from every vendor and absolutely everything was delicious! I cannot say enough good things about this place, don't sleep on this spot!"}
{"text":"If you were expecting the next Pike Place Market right here in good ole Phoenix, think again cause it's not even close. Since one dude controls every food concept that comes into the \"market\" it is basically one guy's food court. There is nobody throwing fish around or huge public gathering area's - nope it's a glorified food court. You won't need to make a special destination trip here, it will end up mainly being for college students who hang out there. They had about four places available and some strange over price concepts including burgers and Bizarre foods kind of southern food. Another Phoenix idea that stinks - and by the way, there is no market!"}
{"text":"Nice interior, restaurants make a snail pace look fast. At restaurant \"the place\" we Paid 26$ for 2 sandwhichs took 28 minutes to get them."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to be. Speak Easy Night was a different experience. Loved the live Big Band music and watching folks dance.
The booze is a bit pricey though. Good service. We tried the blue cheese chicken sandwich with garlic fries, from the Burger Joint, one of the restaurants located inside. It was not all that, the fries were tasty but need to be less greasy and more crunchy. They have free dance lessons at this time as well. Restrooms are very clean. You may choose to sit outdoors or inside on first or second floor. Great spot to take out of town visitors."}
{"text":"This is such an interesting space! It's like a food court, but instead of having multiple chain restaurants like the mall the five restaurants here are unique establishments. One is a bar, another is a coffee shop, another is a burger joint, another is a salad and juice bar, and there's also an Asian fusion place. I had a cookie cream sandwich from the coffee shop and it was 4 dollars but delicious, and it was also vegan. I'm unsure if the other establishments offer vegan options since I didn't order from them.

The bathrooms are upstairs as well as places where you can study. They have outlets up there for computers or if you need to charge your phone. When I was there, there was a film crew filming a video. Interesting. So you might be able to rent the space.

Nice building, space, and place.

The only reason I knocked a star off was for the prices. Since it's more like a cafeteria I would have thought the prices would take that into account, but the prices actually are restaurant prices, meals are around $10 - 15.

The fine details of the building like the bathroom doors, outdoor accents, (etc) give the place its own unique character, it's really a charming structure.

There's also a billiards table upstairs. And there's boardgames downstairs at the end of the bar. So you can just ask to use them and bring them up or play them downstairs if there's enough seating."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of this new place. I'm not really into food courts and that's basically what this, a food court with a bar. I chose the burger stand and ordered the blue cheese burger. All I could taste was the bun because the burger part was about as thin as a Big Mac patty.  I also ordered the crispy zucchini which was cornmeal coated zucchini. However all of the coating fell off zucchini when you tried to pick it up. The ranch dipping sauce for the zucchini tasted like a shaker full of salt. I will say the outdoor patio was a nice space but not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"The building is beautiful. 

Great high ceilings, plenty of place to sit with a group or spend the day working. The First Friday marketplace is great, as well as the indoor farmers market. Everything else, however, is lacking. The bar service is incredibly slow and more than once I've given up and gone home because I couldn't even get staff to acknowledge that I was there. The food is fine if not bland, definitely not worth the price, especially because everything is served to-go and you do all bussing yourself."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for studying or just hanging out. There are a few bars, burger joint and my favorite oyster bar located inside amongst a few other noteworthy eateries. They have corn hole boards which they put out on the patio. I love the industrial style openness and exposed brick. It's a vintage warehouse space hosting community events and a farmers market. The atmosphere is unmatched!"}
{"text":"Great options for great food. Lots of variety. A little pricey. Great atmosphere. The fire pit outside is awesome. My husband and I sat down outside for a drink during first Friday and got a burger and beer. A little bit of a wait but it was a good time. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love DeSotos. Great vibe, great patio, great indoor decor, and it has something to offer everyone. Whether you're looking for coffee, a cocktail, beer, food, or games. I also looove the free yoga classes on Saturday and the local/community feel. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that the food (that I've had at least) is pricey and pretty particular. Wouldn't hurt to have more options."}
{"text":"A beautifully done adaptive re-use project!!  Great atmosphere with lots of little vendors to choose from.  DOG FRIENDLY IN AND OUT!!"}
{"text":"Personally, I am quite the enthusiastic frequent of Desoto. 

Foremost, I will comment on the atmosphere and building. Attached to this review are several pictures, nonetheless, the structure is modern, spacious and intriguing. The building is an open concept with an upper level balcony/loft which is nice during the crowded nights. Moreover, the outside area is characterized with canopies over the concrete tables, which is usually accompanied by overhead music. 

Next, the vendors are dynamic in style but all offer delectable food. From a west coast shellfish bar to a Latin/Asian cuisine, the Desoto is great. Personally, I find the salads at Radish and the coffee in the coffee area to be excellent. 

Lastly, the service at Desoto is impeccable. Every vendor staff member I have met has been hospitable and knowledgeable. Desoto is setting the standard in customer service. 

My only point of critique, which could be rooted in personal incredulity, is that the music is too loud. Especially outside, I have found it extremely have conversations while standing at a normal distance. 
However, through and through, I recommend the Desoto Market as a Phoenix classic that ought to be visited by every demographic."}
{"text":"Desoto Central Market is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. I come here multiples times a week, but this is the first time I've thought about reviewing it. 

Downstairs there are multiple mini-restaurants and a coffee bar. There is plenty of seating and an outdoor patio that has misters to keep cool. There is also an upstairs area with additional seating. Their happy hour special of a burger, fries, and mystery beer for $10 is always great during lunch, but there are plenty of other options available from multiple restaurants. 

On weekdays, this is the perfect place to grab a coffee and get to work. It's usually pretty easy to find an outlet upstairs and they have wi-fi! 

On weekends, it might get a little busy, so you might want to leave your work at home, get one of their $5 pitchers, grab one of the board games they keep available at the bar, and just hang out. With that said, it's just about 5 o'clock on a Friday right now and it's just barely louder than it usually is so I'm just avoiding doing some work by writing this review! 

Overall, this place is excellent. Definitely will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"This idea is very cool! The vibe here feels so new and different. It was my first time here so I decided to give the Burger Joint and try and their burger is pretty decent. Despite the long wait for just a burger and some fries, everything went great. I came during happy hour so it was $10 for their burger and a mystery can beer. Beer didn't taste bad and you can always substitute for a non-alcoholic drink if you like. 

Service was great and the decor here is so nice. The feels and environment feel very refreshing. I will definitely come back another day to try other place in there."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Desoto Central Market much when it opened some years back.  Even encouraged others to visit and brought guests.  Most times visits were adequate and food enjoyable, albiet somewhat price for self service - food court style.  Salads, Bento Box and \"Dragaon\" and others were great.  Today was a mixed experience as The Provisionary dropped the ball and lacked vision.  30-35 minute wait for a simple turkey and avocado sandwich. Which once they remembered and delivered took less than a moderate interest in the 35 minute wait and our patience.  My Adobo Dragon Bento Box with Grilled Salmon of course was delivered in 4 minutes.  Grilled salmon, fresh, brown rice, side salad excellent.  Turkey sandwich of my guest was 'hunks of turkey' poorly carved on a grilled fresh bread and a swaab of guacamole sauce.  Tsk Tsk. Lacks \"Vision\" in my book.  Hope they can get it together as the Desoto Central Market can't afford many disappointments as one means several people in our group won't be back.  (For the same price of $30 two of us can sit at the Vic or at Lucy's get waited on and include a tip.)"}
{"text":"Lots of options and a great bar! I love it when I can get a good cold brewed coffee, a craft beer, and a variety of great foods. The goat cheese curds are awesome and a must-try. Laurel at the burger joint is a wonderful human being. Check out handsome Brian as well. Sunday brunch is my favorite, Baby Got Brunch serves up radical 90s jams and $3 mimosas! Bring your pup!"}
{"text":"Fun spot to hang out for homework, chill out with friends, and have a small bite or drink."}
{"text":"Way excited for this establishment to open, even came opening weekend. But each and every time I leave totally disappointed. I still love the concept and I love the building. At first it was terrible terrible service and the bar, taking 40 minutes to order a drink. Then that was fixed - okay no more problems! Just kidding! Went for \"breakfast\" which is apparently brunch. Which okay, that's fine to open food at 11am, but WOW to not even have food prep completed at 11am?! I know the chef is amazing and I know he's worked at great restaurants, so I would expect to see food being turned out right after 11am. We got there early and waited to order, placing ONE biscuit and gravy order at 11:02. This biscuit took 42 minutes to be made and given out. What in the actual heck?? Granted it was great, totally delicious. But 42 minutes for a biscuit when you're second in line is beyond crazy. At this point it's almost noon.....

We've had amazing and wonderful service at Walrus and The Pearl and quite honestly that restaurant and those brownies from Tea and Toast will keep me around. I can't even begin to justify paying for that monstrosity Bloody Mary when it's made from a mix."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go when you can't agree on where to eat! Plus atmosphere is great- good music love ya of different seating - and I love seeing buildings being brought back to life! Bartender on patio - great service - excellent service for me and helped my group of teenagers out (lots of people just ignore kids)."}
{"text":"I'm Glad we have First Fridays here in Phoenix. It brings in a lot of the diversity, worldly remedies and most interesting art scene known to the Southwest. When i first walked up to the side of Desoto, my friend Drey opened the back door and we entered into what felt like a an art museum mixed with a food court and full bar. The DJ was fire, had a lot of great alternative, r&b (feel good) type tracks blazing. Minimal wait time at the bar, my guy (cant recall name) but cop me a tequila sunrise because the first was made too spicy for my liking! $5.47 for my 1st drink, can you say leggo!

The service was awesome at The YardBird, i recommend the Catfish...super bomb! Sit outside on the patio if the weather allows, this past weekend was fall like for Phoenix ;-) 

Definitely visit worthy, and has great retention value.
4 STARS"}
{"text":"DeSoto Central Market is a pretty hopping place that should be getting a lot more traffic than it does. Who doesn't want a place where everyone can get all different kinds of food they want? Then to top it off you can wash it all down with one of your favorite local brews. There is an upstairs area for those wanting to chill out, and an outdoor area for those wanting to enjoy the Arizona sun. I really love this place and think it would be awesome as an event space as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! Wish we had had time to stay. They were setting up some great looking live music. The atmosphere was super fun. Hoping to go again soon and discover all the options."}
{"text":"Stopped here during First Friday for some water/drinks. It's a pretty hipster place with a lot of open/unused space (apparently they use it for salsa dancing sometimes!) and a not unpleasant industrial/midcentury-modern feel. There's plenty of seating a decent selection of food -- I had just eaten at the food trucks down the street (would highly recommend Queso Good) so didn't have anything here, but will update if I do. The drinks are reasonably priced, little over $3 for a beer.

There's group entertainment like big jenga, foosball, and snooker, although the latter two are pretty low quality. 

Overall nothing really special, but not a bad place to stop during a bar crawl."}
{"text":"Just super average all around. During the day time you have to valet your car, since they've closed their parking lot behind the location. 0-4 with this place."}
{"text":"We live near De Soto and we're excited to have what we understood to be a local market- including a grocer, butcher, and florist as of 04-26 none of those vendors are present at De Soto. We tried the burger joint. I had the double dribble, which is described as a double patty with \"secret\" sauce on a sesame seed bun.. Clearly eluding to a fast food chains creation. However with a price point of $11 that does not include any side, fries or otherwise, I believed I would be served a fantastic burger. I was let down and in fact the nod to le Big Mac was more of a exact replication. Thin patties and bland flavor.  I also ordered the goat milk cheese curds.. Which had great flavor, but a small portion. In short the food was a disappointment. The building is interesting, some unique design to look at. As it stands the consensus is a extravagant and overpriced food court. I will revisit once the market aspects of this central market join the team."}
{"text":"Really was interested in what this place was going to become. But so far, it's kinda a dudd. The food choices seem slim. The Toast is nice for coffee and treats. But nothing else much going on. I was hoping for it to be more of a hip \"LA Farmer's Market\" vibe. But we'll see if it gets better. Maybe now with the weather changing, we'll enjoy that over-priced patio?"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to stop after shopping the downtown galleries on Third Friday. Everyone is friendly and the service is prompt and friendly. There is a fantastic area to sit and have a glass of wine with friends or stroll to the food court area in the back where there is a diverse array of choices. It should continue to get better and grow in popularity. Great ambience!"}
{"text":"When I drove past Desoto Central Market on my way home from work, I made a mental note to go there for dinner. After some yelping, I was super excited to try out this place and see what it has to offer. I am from Atlanta, and it looked similar to a place we have called Krog Street Market (which I loooove). 

I walked inside and was instantly impressed with the vibes and decor. It was wonderfully decorated for Christmas and I happened to come in on Trivia night, so that was a plus. I'm not sure if it as because I went on a Tuesday, but it was not very crowded. 

It took me a while to decide what I wanted to eat. I wasn't crazy hungry to I decided on Radish to get a salad and juice. Both were yummy and I definitely recommend. I wish I could have sampled everything!

I stayed for a while and played some trivia. Wonderful experience. Next time I am in Phoenix, I'll definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Such a unique place! Went there over the Holiday's and enjoyed the food, drinks, music and dancing (watching not participating). We had a great time and appreciate the reuse of a historic car dealership. I hope it is able to anchor itself in the area and continue to evolve. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A tasty (but pricey) option at DeSoto Central Market in Downtown Phoenix.  Located right behind the main bar area on the first floor, DCM Burger is a no frills kitchen setup that serves a variety of burger options (including breakfast burger options) using what they claim is the best locally sourced hormone and antibiotic free meat they can get.  You do pay extra for the privilege as most burgers here run anywhere from $12 up to $20.  The ones I've had here are good, but it's hard for me to justify the price even if the meat is of a very specific quality.  I've had the DeSoto Burger before (with cheddar, bacon and wine braised onions) as well as their Garlic Chicken Sandwich (the only chicken sandwich on their menu).  Both were pretty solid and their handcut fries are also decent.  You can also switch out veggie patties with any of their burger offerings.  As with all the food vendors at DeSoto, just order and they'll bring it out to you.  The kitchen is usually staffed by only 2-3 people at a time which unfortunately has meant when DeSoto is busy I've waiting up to 10 minutes for my food.  Bottomline, if you're okay with forking over somewhere around $15 for a good burger and fries, DCM Burger has some pretty tasty offerings morning, Noon, and night.  Just be sure to pack some patience."}
{"text":"What's happened to DeSoto over the past year??? We went in tonight - bar menu totally changed from craft cocktails to koolaid type cocktails - which they were out of all ingredients for except one...... and 2 of the 3 items I tried to order to eat they were out of - one had been off the menu for at least a month (but menu still shows it). House cocktails don't have prices on them - they're $12. 

But what happened to the DeSoto Smash? And if that mushroom burger was actually made to spec, that needs to come off the menu. It was inedible. 

I would have had this discussion w staff but the bartender had only been there a week and he was great. 

Soooo- apparently some significant change has occurred within the biz and we will prob not be back.... unless they put the DeSoto smash back on the menu and then I can overlook the other flaws."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with some new friends! We had a training across the street so this place was super convenient.  I was really surprised that this place wasn't overflowing with people - we showed up at exactly noon and it wasn't too busy.  Maybe we just got lucky.

This place is filled with lots of different options to choose from.  The interior is super hip and artsy.  I think I saw a little coffee bar somewhere near the front entrance.  It's definitely the perfect place to get some work done, meet up with some friends, or even go on a date.
I don't know what the parking situation is like, but there is a ton of space and seating options inside! There's a whole second floor!

I got the fry bread from the Burger Joint.  I asked for extra jalapenos because the woman there told me that the green chile wasn't spicy.  The dish is HUGE so I'd definitely recommend splitting it with 1-2 other people.  It was yummy, but I definitely think it could've had more flavor.  I'd recommend trying it out, but I probably wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"Love that I live just up the road from here.
Always bring my visitors here for lunch as I am in love with the concept and it is just too cool of a spot.
Parking is behind the building and there is always street parking.
Outside tables are always fun but inside is just beautiful.  Large bar on the ground level in the middle and they have parlour games you can borrow like scrabble and monopoly.  How fun!
There are about 6 to 7 food places you can choose from.  They just need some more as I just find myself eating at the adobo spot and cajun place.  Also gotta love Radish juices!!!
Upstairs has a meeting conference room and more tables.  
Night time is definitely a prime time for the place to get busy.
Its like an old industrial buildling with pipes and warehouse feel but modernized. 
Thanks for being in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place to meet friends for dinner, happy hour or birthday celebrations. I fell in love with the venue history and its location, now I book all of my catering and business functions through them. The chef and event staff are great, always hands on with my events. DeSoto Central Market is always busy, super trendy, delicious and not to mention a fabulous location with its own parking lot.

This place has an overall fun, hipster vibe and always has some exciting event, live band or secret happy hour!"}
{"text":"So I love this little warehouse turned multi-market/restaurant/bar/coffee shop/ art exhibit type place. It's a smorgasbord of fun, artsy trinkets and food. I don;t know why some people talk down on this place, it's really such a fun spot to grab food from different vendors, and everything I have had from salad, to burgers, to ceviche has been really fresh and tasty! They also have vendors where you can buy nice cold beers and cocktails, and several vendors have happy hour specials too.
On many a weekend there are yard sales, art exhibits, yoga classes and on First Friday this place gets insanely packed. I have found some really great hand made jewelry, and second hand, vintage stuff like house decorations or old tin lunchboxes, or compact mirrors and received tons of compliments.
I have to say, the thing I like the most about this place is probably the ambiance. I just love the open-ness and vibe of artsy warehouse with little vendors for good ( albeit a tad pricey at times) food and drinks too. If you are in downtown Phoenix, it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had a chance to taste their breakfast burrito and their Hernando. There was just something off about the food that I couldn't put words to. The best way I could describe it is that it tasted a little bit TOO healthy and a little bit TOO bland. The space is really large and nice, but I don't think I will be back again."}
{"text":"Desoto Market has an awesome atmosphere and provides a good space for grabbing a drink with friends. If one wants a kombucha and another a beer, the options are there! Cool concept and it has always been a chill place to hang.

I don't love the food here though. For me (and I will admit I'm cheap), the price point nfortunately doesn't match the flavor."}
{"text":"Why bother? Went to the patio bar. Female bartender, with tattoos and a bun on top of her head, said they were not open for 10 more minutes. Fair enough. Took a 20 minute walk and came back. Went back up to the patio bar. Same bartender was talking with another employee but looking right at me. I stood there for a few but was never acknowledged. Turned and left. Never going back. The place should simply close and reopen under another management company. Get it over with quick. It will happen with service like this."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Amazing food, great atmosphere, lots of delicious alcoholic beverages! Great/Hip place to chill with friends and have a great time."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times and have not been disappointed with any of the vendors. The Kraken(loaded Bloody Mary) and biscuits and gravy have been my favorites, but everything I've tried is great. We recently got a puppy and have been looking for places to bring her. Dogs are welcome on the patio, and you can bring them inside to order. We sat inside to eat and the owner did ask us to take her outside in a very nice manner. He then followed us out with a pitcher of mimosas for the miss understanding. There is no question that I will be back...still haven't even tried the oyster bar."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday evening, lots of people but found a table right away.  We decided on the Desoto Burger, excellent, cheese curds were out of this world good.  Lightly breaded, huge side order.  

The best part, the bar had THAT Strawberry Blonde on tap!  One of my favorite Arizona beers.  Ice cold mugs!

I didn't give 5 stars, only because one of the servers cleaning up tables had such a bad attitude.  

We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to check this place out. Had a friend in town, we walked in, weren't greeted, stood at the bar (not busy) stood there for 15 min no one looked at us and we left. Sad execution for such a cool spot. I'll give it 6 months and try again. Come on people step yo game up!"}
{"text":"All right, DeSoto... your opening was long awaited and now that you are here... I may still go elsewhere. It's an interesting concept- different vendors selling a variety of items... mostly smaller menu specialized things. I work across the street and have seen the whole construction process and read the articles as it was close to opening time... you did a good job hyping everyone up for it. The food is good... at least most of what i've tried. The salad's at RADISH are fresh and filling and my co-worker and a burger and said it was good... but not great. However, the prices are a little outrageous... $50+ for 3 salads and 2 juices at RADISH, $20 for a burger and a beer and $5.00 iced tea that came in a small (large) cup.

Overall, i'll be back, but it won't be nearly as frequent as it could be."}
{"text":"What a lovely reuse project, De Soto Central Market is. They took a building which sat empty on a prominent corner in Central Phoenix for YEARS and turned it into a grand community space, which offers foodie food from independent local eateries (5 stalls at the current moment). Thankfully the food stalls offer many locally sourced ingredients, which is always a plus in my book!

They did a great job with the restoration; leaving exposed beams in the ceiling and exposed vintage bricks in the walls, which both contrast greatly with the added modern amenities and decor. Local artwork hangs on the walls and is offered for sale too. You can also find historical paperwork from the previous business which is hung like art. 

They have two levels of work, play, eat space, complete with a grand staircase which extends off the front seating area, rising over both bars and a back staircase as well.

In addition to offering a fully stocked bar, they offer a coffee bar (Tea and Toast) , a burger stall (DeSoto Central Market), an asian & latin food stall (Adobo Dragon), a vegetarian food stall (RADish), an american food stall (Yard bird + The Larder), a raw oyster bar (Walrus & The Pearl) and if that's not enough they have more to come, which will include a flower stall.

I've enjoyed the Adobo Dragon's rendition of ceviche, which was cured in a citrus pineapple juice and served very soupy, but cannot wait to try the bao buns. Their service was pleasant and inviting too.

I've also eaten at the DeSoto Central Market burger stall a few times and was pleasantly surprised by the South x Southwest pork burger, which was topped with both candied jalapenos and poblano chili, but it wasn't hot at all. What makes me happiest about eating their burgers is the fact that their beef is humanely raised on sustainable US farms and ranches, never given antibiotics or hormones and fed all-vegetarian feeds; however i'm not quite sure about the pork, as it was my first time eating that burger. The fried zucchini is breaded in cornmeal and mixed with ocra, but they don't tell you it's served mixed, and it comes with a side of dressing, which can be either too watery or just perfect.

At RADish I enjoyed the Beard of Zeus salad, which was romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, feta, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, chickpeas, grilled zucchini, tomato, cucumber, red onion, mint, and a creamy roasted garlic dressing. They served it up fresh, salad bar style, giving me the option to opt out of anything I wouldn't eat, but of course I ate it just the way they serve it up!

Tea and cookies from Tea and Toast are always a pleasant treat too, however last week we arrived just after 10am and tried to order a burger (which their menu stated was available after 10am) only to be told they weren't offered until 11am; so we had to leave, ending up at Lenny's Burgers on Central and Thomas (my dad is old school and their breakfast offerings were too #foodie for him; what can I say?).

The best part about this place is the abundance of seating styles. You will find a couple comfy chairs, a couch, a table for two, a table for 4 or a table for many; as well as several outdoor seating arrangements, in addition to a community conference room. The slightly covered outdoor patio also houses a bar (open for special occasions maybe-it hasn't been open during any of my visits) as well as a round fire pit area and a gaming area, which includes shuffleboard and ping pong but I'm holding out for a pool table ^_~. 

You can access the DCM from the light rail, which is caddy corner to the roosevelt station. Its open 7 days a week (closed for most holidays so check their schedule) and offers several events weekly, such as the Pop-up Markets on Fridays from 5 - 9pm and Saturdays from 11am - 3pm and the Farmers' Market on Sunday's from 10am - 3pm. 

On any given day you will find awesome deals and specials. For summer they just extended the M-F happy hour to include extended happy hour on Mondays and Tuesdays from 3pm-close too.

However the best deal is their bottomless mimosas offered on Sundays from 10am - 3pm with purchase of food. Another great deal is for all you #D'backs fans who show them your home-game ticket; because you can buy sliders and a local beer for only $10. 

These types of community food centers are making their way across the United States and being that this one is indoors with AC, makes it a very great idea and foodie destination, for those seeking locally sourced products and great food combinations, which can be slightly unusual or cutting edge. So break out from under that stream of air and get your foodie on!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax, grab some food and get a drink. If you are downtown this a definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Really cool place to bring your friends downtown to start happy hour or grab a bite to eat anytime. They have a full bar and a few restaurants to choose from like Anaheim Packing District in Orange County. The vibe is really chill and you can choose to sit outside or up and downstairs. Parking is usually no problem on the days I go but I'm sure it fills up quick behind the place but its close enough to other parking lots that you shouldn't have too much of a problem going from here to other places."}
{"text":"This review is for bar. The environment is great! Food was great too, but service was atrocious. Not very crowded, but it still took ten minutes to get drink. Also food order was forgotten and came out an hour later. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Such a great concept to open in this beautiful space located on Roosevelt Row!  I can't wait until they get to full capacity with all of the vendors in this great market.  We stopped in shortly after it opened with friends and enjoyed some drinks and some food.  Another time we came by and bought a tshirt and some cupcakes...they have a little bit of everything here."}
{"text":"Desoto is a great place to grab a quick bite or get a drink. Typically everyone is extremely friendly and I love Tea and Toast. Radish also has great salads and there are a few other selections for food options as well. There is also ice cream coming soon?! Only thing I would say is that the stuff there is definitely pricey. You do get a pretty good portion but still. I also love the layout of the market!"}
{"text":"Such a relaxed environment! Great patio, music and food in central Phoenix. Great for groups!"}
{"text":"The location is interesting, it's a super funky old brick building.... But I do wish they had a parking lot instead of used the church parking across the way (because I'm from arizona... And well? I'm lazy. I'll admit it) I will say all the food inside is divine. But, the market wasn't set up yet, so I'm waiting on that! But tea and toast makes me not so grumpy in the morning, and the Cajun place? Ohmygoodness.... Their cauliflower is so good."}
{"text":"Have been twice and love the building and what's been done with the space.  I am writing this review in the hopes that Mgt reads this.  Love the concept and would love to see this place succeed.  First and foremost nearly every bartender moves like an extra out of The Walking Dead (I mean the Zombies, not the humans!).  Twice we've been in and twice I have witnessed and overheard griping about the slowness.  

On a more positive note, I ordered a Ceviche from Adobo Dragon and it was a nice sized portion with the unusual flavor pairing of pineapple with the fish.  Creative and refreshing.  Again the service, believe it or not, was slow as molasses.  Ceviche for the dining area means scooping same into a ToGo container and a bag of chips.  Fifteen minutes? Really?

They need a real manager or two in there to keep people focused and moving, other than that, we have a winner here."}
{"text":"DeSoto Central Market exceeded my expectations, despite coming here when almost all the restaurants were closed. DeSoto is spacious with ample seating on the bottom level where the food is with additional tables on the second floor, and patio seating in front. 

Arriving for dinner at 9:00pm only Adobo Dragon and The Larder + The Delta were still taking orders and serving food. Only having those two allowed our group to try most of the menu. I enjoyed most of the dishes that I tried from both places, but it was pricey. I loved my experience at DeSoto Market and will definitely be back to try the other places.

Adobo Dragon is fusion Asian-Latino Cuisine and they do a good job melding the two flavors together. We ordered the Paella Ramen, Chicken Bao, Pork Bao, Fish Bao, Carnitas Wonton, and Paps Bravas. I enjoyed all of the items I ordered with my favorite being the Pork Bao.

The Larder + The Delta was a good mixture of flavors. We ordered the Crispy Pig Ears, Cauliflower, Fried Chicken Skin Po Boy, Shrimp Boil, and Two Wash Ranch Herb Roasted Half Chicken. The dishes that were fried were my least favorite because it was rock-hard and difficult to bite. But I did like the flavor of the cauliflower, shrimp, and cornbread oyster stuffing that was underneath the chicken. I would love to come back to The Larder + The Delta to try their other dishes.

What I recommend:
-- Adobo Dragon: Pork Bao, Carnitas Wonton
-- The Larder + The Delta Cauliflower, Two Wash Herb Roasted 1/2 Chicken"}
{"text":"From The Provisionary, I ordered the Citrus Marinated Turkey Breast sandwich which came with a side of plain potato chips with the right amount of crunch. I'm a sucker for a damn good sandwich and this place met those expectations. The bread was toasted just right and the turkey was so flavorful but not overpowering where you lost the taste of turkey. The greens in the sandwich added a nice, light flavor and texture to it to bring it all together.

From Adobo Dragon, I waited until their happy hour at 3pm to order their pork and veggie bag at 3.25 each (instead of paying upwards of $9 for 2 outside of happy hour). I'm glad I did. The veggie bao was flavored better than the pork, but the veggies didn't seem to be cohesive with the bun. The pork bao had a floral, curry flavored spread that didn't seem to mesh well with the pork. On top of that was bleu cheese crumbled atop the pork, topped with pumpkin seeds. A combination I'm
Not fond of and wouldn't try again.

The Provisionary: 4/5
Adobo Dragon: 2/5"}
{"text":"Love the concept, but DO NOT valet or park in the valet parking lot (which is pretty much the only place to park). My friend and I went to Desoto on Sunday, October 11th for drinks and to check out the farmers market. I pulled up to the complimentary valet and the gentleman working the valet seemed more interested in what was on his phone than valeting vehicles. Since the valet didn't acknowledge us, I parked my car in the valet parking lot and headed in. We came out an hour later and from the initial appearance nothing had changed. The valet man was still standing at his post, under the umbrella with his face planted in the phone, looking up and nodding every time a new vehicle came into the lot. As I approached my 2015, 3 month old vehicle, which was about 20 feet away from the valet guy, I noticed my driver side door had a 2.5ft scrape and dent from a white or silver vehicle that hit my car as they were obviously trying to back out of their parking space. I initially felt relieved knowing the valet man HAD to have witnessed/ heard the impact since my car was parked almost directly in front of him, but when I asked if he saw who hit me, his response was \"Uh, no.\", and he went back to reading whatever was so interesting on his phone. The valet employee had no care, concern, or empathy which was extremely odd. My friend and I looked around for cameras in the lot but didn't see any. My $3 sunday funday mimosa trip has turned into a $500 insurance deductible to get my BRAND NEW car fixed, and the charming valet gentleman pretty much gave us his middle finger."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is the real sell point! For sure the food is good, but really the environment is why one should go here! As far as the food goes, it's hard to go wrong, every place seemed to have extremely awesome food. 

Also, they have a lot of open space for one on ones and large group gatherings."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  The space has a great feel, history, and vibe.  Grab a place to sit, order whatever you want, sit back and people watch.

A great addition to downtown!  I look forward to watching them grow and prosper."}
{"text":"The concept is cool, I like having options all in one place. But the water they put out tastes horrible. It doesn't taste filtered at all. On top of that the cups and water dispenser sit on a gross dirty tray and it grosses me out!! Wish they wouldn't go grunge with the water :/"}
{"text":"Love the ambience, great friendly people starting off with a mimosa then the classico  which is traditional 2 eggs, bacon and toast, my wife will have the breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"This is a breakfast review of Tea & Toast Co. - yes! They serve Noble bread! My tummy thanks you! Excellent coffee (their own blend), great service."}
{"text":"I have tried this place so many times. In the evening it's like hanging out at a cafeteria inside Target. Other times it can be like a redneck bbq without any food. Also, without any tough rednecks. The food here is weird, at best. It never smells like someone is cooking food. The prices are higher than you would expect, and the service is always worse than you hope.
It's an open Meetup spot with easy access to clean bathrooms. Wash your hands, please.
P.S. I tried to add a picture, but the place looks pretty abandoned at 8pm"}
{"text":"I really like the location and the rennovated historic auto dealer building they are in is awesome. Inside is spacious with plenty of central seating and a 2nd floor area as well. They also have a large outdoor area with an outdoor bar.  The concept is interesting in that they house 7 or 8 different businesses in the one building.  3 or 4 food service businesses,  a bar, a floral shop, a tea/coffee shop, bakery, and at some point even a small grocery maybe. Since it was their grand opening, some glitches can be expected, and there were a few. The wait time at the inside bar was ridiculous, and it really wasn't that busy. It took 20 minutes to get noticed just to order a beer. The bar tenders seemed inexperienced and were taking inordinately long to mix some of the fancy drinks on the menu. The tap selection is small, about 8, but they did have some good craft  beer with the majority of them AZ breweries. Kudos to that!  Pet peeve however. If you are going to offer craft beer, serve it in the proper glasswear and not ice cold! My Sculpin IPA came in a large frosted mug more appropriate for root beer at an A&W. If I am going to pay $6 for a craft beer, I want to taste it and drink it from  an appropriate glass. The burger we had called the Desoto burger, was excellent as were the side order of fries. However, as the first reviewer mentioned, a bit spendy at $16. $22 for a beer and a burger. Which brings me to my final comment. This is set up like a food court in that there are no waiter people. It seemed rather chaotic at this juncture and I personally would rather not wait in lines to get served and then hunt down a table food in hand. On the first day you could not order a burger, where you got your drink at the bar. I think the bar and burger joint are run by the same owner and this will change in the future. If you want food from other vendors however, you will still probably have to make a couple of trips."}
{"text":"Amazing concept! I'm beside myself! Your whole experience starts as soon as you set foot in the market. The designers did an incredible job with this place. It inspires the soul. 

For those of you haven't been to DeSoto yet, go! It's like a souped up version of a food court only 100 times better. You'll find something for every taste, from coffee and a nosh to salads to burgers to good ol' southern comfort food. But these are no ordinary dishes, all the chefs have put a modern twist to the traditional grub. And of course, take advantage of the full service bar, because what's brunch without a Bloody Mary? I'm definitely coming back here, 365/24/7 (or as close to that as possible)."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by this unique marketplace for a Wednesday night live band, and I had a blast. The layout of the building is wonderful, with a food court in the back, a bar in the front, a store in the loft, and a meeting room in the back!
There were several different kitchens to choose dinner from, and I settled on a DeSoto burger--you order at the counter. The burger was great--juicy, with sweet onion and complimenting flavors. I chose a side salad that had a salty-sweet dressing. 
And after dinner, we went upstairs to watch the band play and swing dancers dance. A few people upstairs were there to study or work on their computers, and they didn't seem to mind the noise too much.
The music was loud, but it was very fun to people watch."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. I would say it's unfortunate that the other businesses in the market should suffer because of a bad experience at one business, however in this case I believe it applies to all the restaurants. We went to each restaurant to check out their menus and not one greeted us or asked if they could help in anyway. We then chose to sit at the bar and order lunch, not sure what was going on with the bartender apparently he had only one speed, slow. It seemed to me as if the guy was high on ... something. Another reviewer described the bartender as zombie-like, an apt description. My lunch companion spilled his drink and the bartender simply handed him a towel to clean it up. Then, instead of getting him a new drink the bartender unloaded the dishwasher and spoke to a co-worker, five minutes later he decided to get my companion his refill. The food was good however the burgers took about 45 minutes to come out, not an issue if it's the lunch rush but it was 2 in the afternoon. The fries made an appearance 10 minutes later. I had to ask for napkins (paper) and silverware (plastic). Such a cool concept, unfortunately we will not be back."}
{"text":"Very unique and fun atmosphere. The radish place had great salads, the large is enough for 2 to share. We tried all the appetizers at the asian/latino fusion place; they were all quite delicious. Some of the best veggie wraps I've had and the wings had a really great flavor."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is very appealing and brings a lot of character to Downtown Phoenix.  I hope they do well, and I will definitely come back to try other places.

I was very very underwhelmed by my meal at The Burger Joint.  I had the first thing on the menu, which was the brioche cheeseburger.  I dont think I've ever had a more basic-looking burger. It literally didnt have any toppings--just cheese.  The brioche bun was good, but cmon...Did I choose the wrong burger?  

The fries were also the kind of fries that are frozen and super processed.  The kind you expect at a baseball game.  But this isn't a baseball game.  And I still paid $12 for that ripoff.

I hope other places arent like this...I'm starting to think all these hipstery eclectic concepts are super creative, overpriced, and bad.  I hope I'm wrong"}
{"text":"This is a great new place with a great concept. I think over time it will be very successful, however we were disappointed with the service we got at the bar. All the great vibes we got were dampened by our bar service. The bartender was condescending and assumptive with regards to his customers. He acted like he really didn't care. I hope you don't get him."}
{"text":"Fun! Fun! Fun! Its a fabulous space! I wish more people would enjoy this wonderful concept. Very European! Coffee Bar, Juice Bar, Liquor Bar, Wine Bar, Oyster Bar, Burger Joint etc etc etc all little businesses within one fabulous building supporting each other!!!!! C'mon people open your minds and broaden your horizons and support this local concept! DO NOT LOOK AT ANY OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!!! Our town is growing into such a cosmopolitan city.... We Love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place, much needed addition to central/downtown phoenix. Have been here a few times since it is an easy walk from my place. Free wifi, tea and coffee place, bar,  delicious \"restaurants\"/food stands, couches to lay back and relax; what more can you ask for! They still have to open a few more places but I'm still loving this place"}
{"text":"We went to the Huss Brewing ship inside here. We had a couple different beers- the Koffee Kolsch was absolutely delish!!! Had a hint of coffee as you drink it, but a crisp, light bodied light beer at the finish. Definitely getting this in the AM more often!!! The Scottsdale blonde was certainly flat and flavorless though - hopefully they correct that next time. We will be coming back!! Super cool market with many different food and beverage options to chose from"}
{"text":"I don't quite know what to make of this place. I really wanted to love it. The concept is cool and the design seems cool until you walk inside. Natural light fills the massive two story room from the Windows surrounding. 

It feels sort of like a mall cafeteria, but more upscale. It feels empty, honestly. The weird thing is - it's not. I decided to try the food at the Japanese restaurant (the name I didn't bother remembering) on the first floor. The food at that particular restaurant was horrible. The rice was over cooked and had absolutely no flavor. The only thing I could finish was the salad. That was good. It was a side salad 

Maybe someday I'll muster up the courage to try another restaurant in Desoto Market, but not likely any time soon."}
{"text":"So far everything I've tried in here has been super good. Adobo Dragon yummy!! The oyster bar ! The burger joint delish! I can't wait till it gets cooler outside so I can do brunch there again!"}
{"text":"\"SHOW ME YOUR PAPERS!\" I was on the patio with my friends lap dog when a large man wearing a black chefs uniform barked at me \"does it have papers.\" I replied I'm dog sitting and yes I'm am sure he is registered in Maricopa, I know he is up to date on all his vaccines. I then waived my husband to come over quickly. The large man then said \"I need to see your papers. If you do not have them on you, you will have to leave.\" I felt embarrassed because he had drawn attention to me and was now asking me for papers. Being a Chicano this is very offensive. I quickly stood up, turned around and left. I will tell all my friends how I was treated at desoto."}
{"text":"Boo!!  Not impressed AT ALL!! ...wait...the building and the location are faaab, but the 100 wait staff do not know their heads from their bums! Every single wait staff I happen to have come across were super NOT confident and not really sure about anything, which included if they should help/serve me...or how to make a drink...WTH?!!! Opening weekend SHOULD be exciting, confident, attractive, enticing. NOTE TO MR OR MS OWNER: with THAT many staff members, WHY THE HELLOPERATOR DO YOU NOT HAVE TABLE SERVICE? not a fan!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing concept here. Almost like food truck town in a brick and mortar. I went to The Yardbird and it was so ridiculously good. Expectations exceeded. I sat at the counter and watched chef prep and cook the meal. He suggested the fried quail and biscuit and it was on point. I'm not a good snob but when it comes to well balanced flavor I fall in L O V E. The gravy was the most legit I have had and being from the south o have eaten a lot of gravy. I finished it off with a cream soda and his spicy brussels. I'll check out other places on the market but not without grabbing something from his place first."}
{"text":"Have come here about three times and have always been slightly disappointed but really wanted to like it
But the last time was especially bad and will be the last. Ordered a breakfast bagel and side of fruit and a latte.  The latte was great, but then after about 15 minutes of waiting ( it was not busy at all) I went to ask about the progress of food seemed to be very long for a simple bagel.They said they'd bring it right over. Ten minutes later I now have to head to work so I go back to see what's going on and if I could get it to go. The guy went to check Turns out they had never even started it, even after i had checked the first time. I was now out of time and had to leave and go to work. They refunded my meal but I left very unhappy and hungry."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple of places here and they have all been so good! Tried out The Burger Joint and it did not disappoint (the place inside is actually called the \"burger joint\"). I got the Desoto burger and the Green chili Fry bread. First the burger... the flavors were really good, bun crispiness was on point, but the burger was over cooked and the whole thing was REALLY salty. I'd give the burger by itself a 3.5. The fries though.. spot on. The real star of the show was the  green chili fry bread! You get hit with the sweetness of the bread and then the bite from the fresh jalapeños, and the greenchili pork is like the icing on the cake. If I was going to come again I would definitely get the fry bread. It's easily big enough to share. Moral of the story, GET THE FRY BREAD,if you get a burger make sure you double check that they will cook it to your liking."}
{"text":"This place is really cool and the atmosphere is great!
There is a bar and a few different food options inside of this old warehouse.

5 stars for the bloody mary! It's by far the best one I've ever had. I believe the secret is \"Kyle's vodka\" which is deliciously infused. The garnishes were so delicious too! My mini burger was so so so so good on it's pretzel bun, the pickle was marinated in something yummy, the brownie was awesome, the bacon was nice and crispy and the veggies were delicious. The drink itself is very flavorful too :P
*They must garnish it differently all the time though because last weekend the burgers were on a different bun and there was no brownie.

I ordered breakfast the last time I was there. For 1 piece of avocado toast that was severely lacking avocado was a whopping $10. Not worth it. We also ordered a delicious salmon bagel sandwich that was $8."}
{"text":"*Service is 4 stars because they bring the food wherever you are, which in this case was very convenient since we were at the bar. Bar service was prompt and friendly. Only Odd thing is that there are people who hover around very boss/supervisor-like and not engaging with the customers. They just stare at you for a couple of seconds and move on lol. 
*Drinks get 4 stars because they are delicious and they indulged me on making a cocktail that I thought they wouldn't and it was really well made. However, they're pricey. 
*Atmosphere gets 5 stars because I love how open the place is and you can sit wherever you want. The decoration is modest and is resisting the urge to become fu***** hipster, which for this guy? It's two thumbs up. Now, bathrooms in the second floor? Fine with me but, what about handicap people? There's gotta be an elevator there somewhere right?
*Food gets 3 stars not because of the taste, it was delicious and creative, and tbh I will have it again (many times) but because of the price and the \"microwave frozen food\" container it came in.
*What we took from the experience? We're definitely coming back. We just hope that \"the guy\" listens to the dozens of people that have spoken about the prices and takes it down a notch (or two)"}
{"text":"Cool downtown vibe. Lots of parking. Yummy food and delicious coffee. Free wifi.

Big open space and lots of comfy seating 

Perfect place for a meeting , breakfast was delicious. 

Lots of gluten free and modified choices 

There's a cool little bar area too. I can't wait to come back for first Friday and meet up with my friends."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing.  The staff was very rude we had asked for one of the waitresses to help us turn on the heater outside and her response was I don't know, I don't think they work, sorry. This is while every other heater on the patio was on. Set up doesn't really make any sense which makes it difficult to receive quality service. I wouldn't recommend going here."}
{"text":"It's a fun and trendy atmosphere. Complete with all the hipster food options. (Pb&j Sliders) It's more of a beer with lunch /dinner kind of place than a chill coffee spot. It gets pretty loud , especially on first Friday. They get packed and you will wait forever at the bar. However it's perfect to get out of the house and out of the intense heat."}
{"text":"This place is fun anytime but especially on first Fridays of the month. They have additional vendors and great music on those days. It has a little bit of food for everyone no matter what you like or your diet, I recommend getting a coffee the coffeethat they have is amazing. However all of the restaurants in there are exceptional. They do close for private events at times so if you're driving far be sure to doublecheck. Do not bring your kids."}
{"text":"This seems to be a very prejudiced place.  People act like they are all above you, ie. the many customers here.  The food here at the various stands are mediocre at best and overpriced.  The customer service is some of the worst in Phoenix Metro area, specifically the raw oyster bar.

The workers were friendly at the bar, juice bar, and burger bar."}
{"text":"Really cute concept and very cool inside. The restaurant's inside can be pretty pricey, my friend got salmon poke for 16 bucks. My  steamed buns (chicken and pork) were mediocre. Next time I really want to try the burger place and Radish! Also, want to try happy hour!"}
{"text":"I always have a great time when I come. They have events throughout the week. It's a great hang out spot for a group of friends. The food is good and you get a wide variety to choose from but a little pricey."}
{"text":"I love going to desoto market and I tell all my friends about that spot but!!!! This past Friday I went to get the famous desoto burger and man it was horrible the bun was swapped out for a seasame seed bun the patty was a dry pre formed Burger the the usual juicy patty! And u raised the price which is fine because it comes with fries now but what if I don't want fries! Sorry 13 bucks for that dry burger really sucked and I brought two desoto burgers and fries and cheese cruds! Almost 40 bucks for a crappy burger! I hope u guys go back to the original recipe!"}
{"text":"Bartenders make the bar, and Capono is The Man at DeSoto.  Brian C--with the twinkling blue eyes that remind you of a baby nebula evolving--is as excellent a bartender as his is gorgeous.  I only wish they would stop playing so much Justin Bieber and 90's Jams all the time...NOT!!!   Keep the cheese alive!  The playlist was perfect along with the double mimosas.  (Because the only thing between getting a thimble sized drink and a satisfying one is asking for the Tam-mosa.  I just made it up... go with it ;)"}
{"text":"I've gotta be honest - I was more than pleasantly surprised with this joint.  Right when you walk in you're kind of taken back by the ambiance / retro decor / style of the place.  This is a good thing.  Be different - your consumers will appreciate it!

As far as food goes, I tried the sliders / cheese curds (which were the best goat cheese I've ever had) & the fries - which come with house made ketchup.  All the food items were bomb, and this was the first time I appreciated a sweet pickle on my slider.

Along with that, I got a couple Dale's Pale Ale - since it's one of my favorite brews and ended up leaving incredibly satisfied for less than $50.  Took a walk to the bathroom and got to see the scope of this place, there's something for everyone here (yes, I also pictured Stefan from SNL just now) - but seriously, if you want seafood / Mexican / American / Greek / pastries - you're covered here.  

I'll be back and can't wait to try some other menu items!!"}
{"text":"DeSoto as a concept is great! Really nice community area to hang out with friends or even to just be there and study or work! 

Your experience it's going to depend on where do you get drinks/food from. The bar is good, I just wish they had a larger selection of stouts or porter beers. The tea and toast place it's decent! Their coffee it's good and the salmon toast is something else! I love the burger place and the salad place all the way to the back, Radish. The other food places are good but just average, nothing that would blow your mind away. 

In general DeSoto it's a bit pricey. It's still worth going, but not my first choice."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Soundgarden - Black Hole Sun)

In my mouth, I will eat
In disguises oh you know
Hides Yard Bird & The Larder
The Walrus & The Pearl
Boiling meat, summer drinks
Eat the Bao at the Dragon's lair
Call my name through the bar
And I'll hear you scream again

DeSoto
Won't you come
And Yelp away the place
DeSoto
Won't you come
Won't you come (Won't you come)



DeSoto is literally a food court, but with hip and funk.  The really enjoyed the concept since it reminds me of a coffee joint, but with with a full bar and food to serve.

I came on a Sunday afternoon and they had little local vendors selling their crafts.  I didn't buy any, but always enjoy local businesses supporting each other.  My buddy and I decided to do our best to try as much as possible.  Out of the 5 restaurants we settled to order from Walrus & The Pearl, Yard Bird & The Larder, and Adobe Dragon.  We just ordered a dozen oysters from the Walrus & The Pearl, which came with 5 different sauces.  My favorite was the sauce that had a ginger vinegar taste; red in color.  The oysters were pretty darn good and fresh as can be.  Next we ordered the Pork Belly bowl from Yard Bird.  It was roasted and doused with a Granny Smith Apple sauce and layered with a pecan crust.  Overall, salty and sour with a perfect crunchy bite.  Probably my favorite of the day.  The next meal came from Adobe Dragon and we ordered the Beef Bao.  It was pretty much Bulgogi beef with slaw stuffed in a doughy bun.  I didn't really care for it since the sauce and everything became mushy after sitting in the sauce for a while.  Needed some texture and also I thought it was over salty.  

In the end, I really enjoyed hanging out at DeSoto Market and the food there can be better, but so much more to try.  A happy hour date with friends to this place is a definite must! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to the DCM with friends on a Sunday afternoon.  Interesting open air layout with a food court atmosphere and more.  The multiple food choices were nice with a little something for everyone.  Food from DCM Burgers was good (Juicy Lucy & Sliders).  The Walrus & The Pearl did not open until we were leaving (next time).  Decent bar with a limited beer selection.  Overall service was kinda slow.  There was an outdoor patio seating area, but it too warm to try it out.  We will definitely come back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"I think this is probably an upgrade from food trucks.   And since I'm not a food truck foodie, I don't know if that's saying much.

I had invited someone to accompany me to the symphony.   He suggested this place as the place to eat before heading downtown.   I had never been here but he said he had.  I checked it out online, but it wasn't really clear to me what is in the DeSoto.

Got there.   A few places to get food, something like a food court in a mall.  I don't do beer.  That place was out.   I don't really care for bread products.   Those places were out.   There was Adobe Dragon, which had sort of Asian food, but nothing seemed appetizing to me.  I think there was a coffee place.   At Walrus and Pearl there was lobster salad on a bun.   I asked if he could prepare it sans the bun.   He said he could.   A salad.   I thought, \"okay.\"  I asked if they had wine.  Yes.  Cab is my choice.  Had that as well.

My tablemate had the curry noodles from Adobe Dragon.  He tried it.  He didn't seem impressed.   I tasted it.  Neither was I.  I don't know why he suggested the place.   He seemed to have a hard time making a decision as to which part of the food court to order.

My salad was good.   There wasn't much to it.  It was a salad, and not a normal thing on the menu.  The wine took some getting used to.  

The building is an old warehouse rehabbed, two stories for sitting and probably using the wi fi and maybe a cup or two of java.   Not a place to eat dinner, that is for sure.  It's cute and trendy.   The food choices aren't mine for a meal but it would be good for a little peaceful reading."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to the famous Oxbow Market in Napa or the Ferry Building in San Francisco, the Desoto is a smaller, brand new version of this idea and the people of Phoenix are pretty excited about it.

 Located in the historic Roosevelt District near downtown Phoenix the market is inside an old, extravagantly restored brick warehouse. A large modern bar divides the vendor area from the dining area. I picked Yardbird+The Larder for my lunch and it was excellent. Please see my review of this vendor for details. Vendors yet to come are Niman Ranch, an oyster bar and a grocery store. 

They are open for lunch and dinner and feature a happy hour and currently have a DJ on certain nights. This is a local,sustainable, nose to tail type of place and if you believe in that type of food you won't be disappointed. 

This is a brand new business so I'm sure there will be some changes but it's pretty darn good!

Very bicycle friendly as they are near one of Phoenix's new bike borrowing stations and they have lots of bike racks and two large parking lots next door."}
{"text":"I love these places that have like multiple places into eat within the building. I suggest trying the place with the seafood. I went around ordering at the other places in the building and the food was good too. And there is also dancing here once a month too if you are into swing dancing! Although I feel the parking lot is a little small if the crowd gets really big at certain times. Then you'll have to park on the streets and pay the meter."}
{"text":"DeSoto Central Market is a gem for a good hipster breakfast and coffee, get some work done pecking away on your Macbook with headphones on, in a fun and open location. An old warehouse turned midweek breakfast/lunch spot has got it going on.

Why go there:
The main coffee shop there crafts great coffee served at perfect temperatures. They also offer and a good array of breakfast item that sound pretentious for a coffee shop in a warehouse... but they deliver. The setting is top notch, there are three true sections in this place, a lounge/apartment loft feel area upstairs good for large groups. A coffee shop dining room downstairs, and a lunch dining room on the other side. There are 5 or so restaurants there (think stationary food truck offerings but a bit more intricate...) they are each their own entities and serve food that are not close to another flavor wise. The ramen shop/Asian fusion spot is great, burgers are delicious, and RAD can hook you up with a liquid lunch. It's a great place for gatherings with friends who want something different and local. Great atmosphere and free wi-if fast as lighting. 

Don't miss:
The London Fog paired with a Bacon Jam Toast... go on make yourself happy.

Tip: 
Park in the designated free parking there, a gentleman named Charles is likely to greet you making sure you're a customer at DeSoto. He'll look out for your ride, so enjoy your coffee and goodies worry free. The GM, Sean, seems to be around often at DeSoto, he's been there each time we've visited if you wanted to express some thumbs up.
This place is unique."}
{"text":"Originally went to Desoto for a free yoga class that they hold upstairs every Saturday morning which was super fun to try.

The market holds different food venders probably about 4 or 5 with different menu selections. 

I went for a breakfast menu and ordered from Tea & Toast, which I heard good things from on Instagram. 

I got the bacon jam toast with a sunny side up egg and watercress garnish, it was delicious! The presentation of the toast was beautiful and the taste was even better I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I'm horrible with names, OHWELL. A friend of mine mentioned this spot to me as a MUST SEE, so of course I did. THANKFUL I DID. DeSoto was probably one of my favorite spots to hang out in. 

Started off inside with Walrus & the Pearl. Oyster shooters, poke bowl, seafood galoreeee. This man does it right. I came back for the second time and only had oysters. TO DIE FOR. Everything is done so well. 

Then shared some snacks at Adobo Dragon; eh, it was good. I had the wings. Maybe I was full, but the chips! Those were yum. 

So we finished off grabbing a few drinks at the bar. I started with a handmade cocktail; mmmmm. But I'm simple, so I switched to beer. We grabbed some games and just hung out outside under the lights. Just a relaxing day AND night; as I'm describing two separate experiences here. At the end of the day, THIS WAS WORTH IT."}
{"text":"This place has potential in that it looks cool and is in a great location. The patio is open and modern and they have bike racks and neat planters in front. 

There are multiple vendors within this open warehouse type space (all of which close around 8pm) that serve various types of food and one main bar area. 

The drinks were actually quite divine, I had The Diplomat and a 1928 (or something like that). Each cocktail was very well balanced and although they were expensive ($50 for 4 drinks) they were good and strong.

We were there for a birthday party and with all of the various vendors closing up, sweeping, taking out trash and just the general drab vibe and strange layout it was to say the least; uninviting.

Kitchens close early so be there before 8:30pm. I've tried appetizers from the burger bar, fries and fried veggies. All decent. The Asian ramen restaurant is good if you like your ramen bland. 

Overall, this place is \"okay\" for the drink quality, but overpriced and lacking in the welcoming vibe department. 

I doubt I'll ever pay another visit."}
{"text":"Fun, but sometimes loud, venue with a variety of beers and food. I went during happy hour, and enjoyed a $4 pint of cider. Not bad for such a trendy place. Food was rather pricey, but good. Three tacos and a large plate of poutine was $24.

We booked a reservation about a month in advance, and called to reconfirm on the day of the event. When I arrived, all of the managers were in a meeting; so I couldn't set up for the group until 15 minutes before the planned start. This was very inconvenient since people were already arriving. They were going to put us in a very noisy bar area - complete with a loud cowbell that the bartender clanged. I asked if another area was available. They put us in the community room. After setting up, a group with a paid reservation came by, asking for the room. So we moved again to an area adjacent to the bar. (As it turns out, another large group was meeting in the bar.) It was still very noisy.

I think it's a great local hangout; but I won't plan any group events there since that went so chaotically."}
{"text":"The market concept of this place is fun and inventive. I've been here multiple times with my friends and family and love trying there great variety of food. The past two times I've been here, I've gotten burgers from the DCM burger and I have to say, by far, the best burgers I've had in awhile. They have this masterpiece called the boss hog. And mmmhmm it's delicious."}
{"text":"The Good: it's a beautiful space, very well laid out. Lots of money went into this place. The different vendors are well spaced. I would even say it's beautiful. 

The Bad: frankly, everything food is pretty bad here. at the yard, I had the French  dip and it was served with the au jus poured over the sandwich, which made it impossible to eat with your hands because it was so soggy.  I got stomach cramps afterward and had the runs for 3 hours afterwards. 

I had a glass of wine here, overpriced ken wright Pinot for $15 for a 6 oz pour. The service was bad, I had to wait 7 minutes for someone to ask me if I wanted a drink. The barkeep didn't even know the menu, or where to find that particular wine. He had to go ask somebody. Then the glass was not clean at all.....there were particulate strands inside and out with whatever they wiped it with. I poured it into another cup. 

I had coffee afterwards, I asked for a vanilla latte, they gave me an overly sweet chocolate mocha. 

The Ugly: service here is horrible, all of the servers are uninspired and have really bad, crooked and unkempt teeth. 

I'm sorry to be so petty, I'm just really disappointed. I had high hopes for this place, but it's really bad. I hope it gets better."}
{"text":"I wish I could recommend Desoto, but it's hard to when it seems like they decide to close early every night. Only focusing on the bar and the burger place, the food is OK but the drinks are good. I wish I had the chance to actually have them, though. I don't recommend going to Desoto at night, but if you do, you better have a second place in mind."}
{"text":"Stayed by the bar for 30+ min
Watched 3 people get served drinks before me
Had my hand up like I was in grade school to get their attention at the bar. After paying 10 as a cover totally not worth it, my advice bring a bottle and drink it in the parking lot. You won't get alcoholic beverages served to you, you'll waste your whole night."}
{"text":"Casual affair cocktail- rye, amontillado, cocchi, ginger snap liquor, cinnamon syrup. Sounds festive and seasonal, but too sweet for me."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place. It is a great concept and there is some really outstanding food here but and there is a huge but it is way over priced. The My Boy Blue! burger was probably the best burger I have ever eaten in my life and their cheese curds are wonderful but $12 just for the burger and another $4 for a small serving of cheese curds plus a drink and tip and you are around $22 for a burger combo. Seriously the place has great food but every stand has similar pricing issues. I would be more than happy paying $12 for that burger if the sides and a drink came with it. Heck even if the side came with it I would probably come in on occasion but the prices are more than a theme park or ball game. I happened to notice a special sign for the item I had ordered at a different stand one day after I ordered and paid. You would think they would have mentioned it as an option (it was slightly different but much less) or have the sign displayed where it was easier to see when ordering. The customer service is very poor here with the customer being considered somewhat of a bother by more than one people on more than one occasion. The other issue this place has is the inside tables are not well made and the table kept moving so we moved to a different one and it had the same issue. You would think they would have spent more on them or bought tables that were more sturdy. It has only been open a few months and they already feel like they are falling apart. I would rate the food 5 stars if the price was better. I would rate the service 2 stars and that is being generous and overall the place gets 3 stars because the food is so good. It really seems like if they lowered the prices the place wouldn't be so empty compared to other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Met some friends for brunch. I had actually walked through it during First Friday a while back. The atmosphere fits in with the area. Because I am a morning person I eat at sunrise and my idea of brunch at 10:30 is lunch. Well on a Saturday you cannot get anything but breakfast style food until noon, by which time we were just about ready to leave. Not all the dishes came with napkins and utensils so they had to be hunted down. To me it comes under the heading of I would not seek it out but nothing would bother me about going if that was where somebody else wanted to go."}
{"text":"Update July 2015: came for lunch on a Monday. Still love the vibe here but wonder why nobody else seems to know it. Somewhat slow - good for us but I'm not selfish. Had the pork patty from burger joint and some fries. Excellent on both charges. Great, lively atmosphere and so fun to grab a latte to take back to the grind! We will be back for salad or sushi/bento box or maybe even happy hour. PS- who are you people who belly up to the bar on the middle of a Monday afternoon? I want to be you next time. Well done DeSoto.

PPS- check out the community room you can rent upstairs- love it!"}
{"text":"Life's rule of thumb should be \" try everything twice\" well just about anything. Does heroine need to be tried once let alone twice?

But this writers is limited to DeSoto coffee and pastry game. With all the great options in downtown Phoenix, Hell Yeah Tea and Coffee is just average which isn't a bad thing but it's far from Supreme yelp greatness. 

The macchiato and pastry were just okay. I'm not super critical  that you can't get some of items list but $7.50 for that combo leaves yah feeling jipped. 

Some of the strong suits. The building is beautiful, with more shops tag haven't been opened I'm looking forward to eating here for lunch or dinner to get a better lay of the land. 

So cheers to another trip with an open mind to DeSoto."}
{"text":"Cool space and cool concept!  I loved the tea from that little tea/coffee shop.  They really fresh brew your ice tea!  And the burger joint.... OMG, to dye for burgers and fries...  

Found parking right next to the building!!  +++  Yes, we are Arizonian and we are lazy.  It is HOT!   LOL!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for groups, since you can grab a huge table, and people can come in and out without reservations or any wait staff buggin' you to leave! 

Location: Off Central. Parking: In the pack or street parking. 

Service: I have had only positive experiences with the various vendors at this location.  In the summer, I was waiting for a friend at the bar, and the bartender was friendly and chatty while I waited.    In the main area, I have always had good service with the wait staff coming by for drinks etc.  

Food: I have tried the Asian place in the back and some of the baked goods at Tea and Toast.  The bento box was tasty, and the server even split it for my friend and me in two separate boxes.   At Tea and Toast, the over priced pop tarts are super tasty, but the sugar cookies are just ok."}
{"text":"Well they \"tried\" to remedy my incomplete burger still messed it up. No toppings but some mustard and ketchup and the stuff was dry. They put a pickle on the side and mind you it was supposed to be bread and butter but nope they couldn't get that right I got dill. 

\"Great\" try ya'll"}
{"text":"Every big city has a market with different food and drink options... Glad that Phoenix is jumping on board and excited for the future of this venue!  The building is aesthetically pleasing with a cool outdoor area!"}
{"text":"Great service and food at reasonable prices. Do not drink the water! It seriously tastes like I imagined irrigation water would taste. Also pretty sure it gave me the runs"}
{"text":"Adobo Dragon and the oyster bar (don't remember the name) were simply fantastic. We ordered several items from each and had no complains. 

It's great to have an upscale small food court in such a great looking location (inside decor is great!)

Only downside is that if you are following gps instructions you might miss the specific restaurant you are looking for. You might think it is not there anymore. Fortunately we decided to get out of the car and ask!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I was recommended by my brother who is a chef that lives in the area. I had s 1/2 rotisserie chicken-(wonderful flavor!), Market vegetables-(red peppers, onions, spinach and yellow cauliflower. I usually don't eat cauliflower but it was awesome!) and garlic mashed potatoes-which had chunks of garlic in it! Soooo good! I got a corn and cowgirl cookie to go. They  also make there own pop tarts here."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like a small restaurant.. I didn't really know what to expect..

I had to drag my niece in bc she wasn't about it..

When you walk in, it looks like there's a bar and a small coffee stand next to it.. so I was wondering wtf we were going to eat.. We went up the stairs and saw the rest of the restaurants.. there's quite a few to choose from!

We landed on the oyster spot & met the sushi chef Mike.. and had a blast! The oysters were very fresh & we were well taken care of. The popcorn shrimp was delicious as well.

We didn't end up trying anything else but we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Overrated! 
From the moment we walked in we were given the up down and the bus girl was annoyed that we had kids. NOT child friendly. 

It's almost like a food court. Multiple restaurants within one. Sharing duties. 

We tried 3 locations. 

The burgers  salty and overpriced 
The delta - my salad tastes like old fish. However the guys was so kind. 
The bar- buzzkill 

Dirty!!!! The table had black grime on it. Gag!  
Won't return!"}
{"text":"Cool venue, but pricey mediocre food and alcohol. An upscale food court of sorts inside an old warehouse building.... I really wanted to like this place... but I didn't. I ordered my favorite meal, red beans and rice which was cooked to order. After a bit of a wait it came - dry and so spicy hot that it was barely edible. My boyfriend ordered the poke from the fish place. He said it was OK, but too spicy as well. The bar was way overpriced with $15 glass of bourbon and $14 mediocre glass of wine. Oh well. This place is scratched off my list for good."}
{"text":"Food was salty and expensive. The decor was very hipster. The open space was nice but no one was looking over it. Not enough tables when we were there. It was just an alright experience."}
{"text":"First off this place rocks. This is s great place to bring your lunch / buy lunch. Prices are a bit higher than other places around here. I brought my sandwich from home which was a small Trader Joe's wrap and it needed fries to go with it. So yesterday 1/25 I ordered fries and waited well over 30 mins for them to be delivered to me upstairs. I went to find out what happened and was told they just came out. Well they were very salty worse than a soft pretzel at a stand at an amusement park. I contemplated should I say something so I decided yes. I let the nice lady at the front downstairs know that they were very salty. She offered to make a new batch but by then I was full so I said no thanks and she said come back tomorrow and that I would get a free basket of fries. I said sounds fair. So today 1/26 I again brought my lunch and went over to the burger stand and said that yesterday the fries were salty and that the lady said to let them know to give me free fries today. The employee behind the counter said it was his fault and apologized. He gave me a number and then I came upstairs and sat down to rest up a bit. One of the other workers came up to me and said who said to give you free fries. (That's the only reason I took a star off and also for the wait yesterday). I explained it was the lady in front and he walked away. So the fries came and I asked for plain fries. (Always definitely ask for plain fries here). They were perfect.. see the picture in my review. I will come back and order something here now and again. 
The garlic fries are great to but I'm not a big fan of garlic fries because the vampires don't like the garlic!"}
{"text":"Really good place and fun too! So many choices to choose for cuisine and it's all done very well. Great open space inside and out. Really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Man, I really want to like this place! Please train up your bar staff! Slow, uninspired,and under trained. I've been here 3x now, and it I have yet to see an improvement. They don't seem to know where anything is behind the bar, do not know your wine list (difference between a sparkling wine/still wine),&  have zero sense of urgency when there are multiple guests waiting in a line. Probably going to give it a couple more tries, because here is great potential, but its just too frustrating dealing with the same lame service every time.  With so many great places opening up within close proximity, service to your guests needs to be a priority."}
{"text":"This review is specifically about THE BURGER JOINT at DCM. It is terrible! 
My fiancé and I stopped by around 1:45 to grab a bite and decided to hit up The Burger Joint. We ordered 2 burgers and fried zucchini as a side. Despite the market being practically empty it took 35 minutes to get our food! Horrible horrible service! I was also surprised that this burger joint doesn't ask how you want your burger cooked. Ours came out very over cooked and rock hard. Our buns were soggy and just overall the burgers were not good. Considering that's all they do I was expecting much better. The zucchini was way over salted as well. To add insult to injury it is extraordinarily overpriced! We spent $35 for two burgers and a side! Outrageous. 

I'd also like to note at this time that when we were leaving I watched the girl working behind the counter wipe her nose with her hand and continue chopping vegetables!! Gross!

Skip this place. Love the idea of DCM but just avoid The Burger Joint. It's a waste of time, money and calories."}
{"text":"For \"the burger joint\" Last visit for us on first friday was super disappointing. For the price, the burgers are expensive for being overcooked and boring. The bun to meat ratio is all wrong, and the lettuce wraps burgers are just sad for the price and served with no sauce. Even the buffalo wings were a dissapointment and devoid of spice and lacked crispyness or flavor. When the highlight of the meal was the fresh side salad something is wrong. Hard to justify coming back here for the price. really dissapointed since it used to be good too."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it!

The concept is way cool!  I instantly thought of a high end food truck park, except indoors and a great bar selection.  

Totally returning!"}
{"text":"This place is too notch fantastic!! Yes, it will be good to have a bit more varieties on food but i like it and have continued to return. I also tried the bachata night. It was fun but i may not do it again. I prefer a place where a bit more variety of latin music. 
I like this place at any time of the day."}
{"text":"Walkedin open seating winning.  Played Jenga and drank Mimosa and ate 1/2 a bacon burger and 1/2 chicken sandwich. #numnum they were out of tea & toast. If you go directly to the bar the food options is from the Joint but if you walk around bottom you have Mexican or seafood and additional options... Upstairs is other seating arrangements and items for purchase. Outside has a lot space and games to enjoy as well. :)"}
{"text":"The Burger Joint's food has gone seriously downhill. Not to mention, they removed their two best items from the menu (cheese curds and the poutine). Further, charging over $15 for a burger, fries, and a beverage is a bit steep for food that lacks in quality. In general, Desoto's, for occupying such a large space, lacks variety."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love this place. The ambiance is spacious, modern, warehouse kind of vibe. There's 2 stories and random cool art on the wall for sale. There is different restaurants featured inside, including an oyster bar and a regular bar that has the best Sunday fun day Bloody Mary's & Mimosas! Will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely thrilled about this place opening up ... just what we need in this area.  I have had the cheese curds twice (can't remember the name of the vendor) ... ask about them.  They are to die for.  Radish juice was great too - and healthy (I know this because it tasted slightly of carrot dirt).  I would give this place more stars if I could.  They are obviously still setting up, but I have no doubt that the future will be stellar based on what I saw the first week.  The atmosphere alone is worth a few minutes of your time - just go inside and see what you think.  I was wowed."}
{"text":"Will give this place 3 stars for now, was excited to head over and try it out and have one of the bloody Mary's with a slider and brownie, when I arrived I asked and they don't serve them after 4, only reason I went was for the Bloody Mary, had to walk out with out one. Another trip is in the works, to try this place out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...nice place for a date (go upstairs!) or to bring friends because usually everyone can find food for themselves regardless of dietary restriction.

The bar has some interesting drinks and helpful bartenders. Surprisingly, the vegetarian options are pretty limited...I know, I know...there's a salad place in here...except, I don't always eat like a rabbit! Plus the salad place is just not that good. The best meal I've had in here is the poke place!"}
{"text":"Food was good, a little too much salt, but we needed it after being in the heat. The red beans and rice were wonderful! The fries were perfectly crispy. Will come again."}
{"text":"Great market with so many vendors! We had the best southern breakfast food. The biscuits and gravy were fresh and tasty. The breakfast burrito was good. My wife ordered the spicy chicken and biscuit sandwich and loved it. The nice surprise was the pesto and goat cheese veggies sandwich. For an appetizer I recommend the fried cauliflower. Also has a wonderful mezcal Bloody Mary. 
Highly recommended."}

This restaurant refused to turn off anyone of their 4 TV's showing an NFL game! I know my husband and my only child defend this right but that doesn't mean I have to support it. This is my first bad review in yelp and I recommend any patriot or service member not to support this establishment until they support the USA and their soldiers. On a personal note: I like the place and the staff but they are not willing to adjust or make needs for their customers......so sad:)"}
{"text":"Great place in downtown Phoenix. It started at the oyster bar where we met a wonderful staff that loved what they did and even gave us some more local destinations to try afterwards. On the way out Kyle (the amazing mixologist) stopped us and asked if we wanted a drink! And Of course we participated in a few. We ordered off menu drinks he recommended  and let him do what he does best. Regardless of what you get there you CANNOT GO WRONG. 

Great vibe in the building as well. Local vendors come a few days a week (I was told). 

Regardless of what people have said about the place it is a must go, and will definitely give you a great perspective of the local community in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at DeSoto tonight. Burger was awesome and had a really tasty cocktail. We brought the puppies. Loved how pet-friendly the place was. Had water bowls for us and a hose. Staff were all friendly and totally put up with our crazy pups!!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my meal at the Burger Joint. I got \"The Classic\" which was just a regular cheese burger and honestly I could've gotten a tastier burger at In-N-Out. I love Desoto's atmosphere and how much space it provides, but they need to step up their game with the food. Even looking at what my friend had from the Adobo Dragon, it didn't not look that great."}
{"text":"I had a hard time deciding how to rate DeSoto.   To me, the words \"Central Market\" make me think that there's going to be a butcher, maybe a small scale grocer, other local merchants, etc.  Not quite.    

What DeSoto is, however, is an old warehouse with a bar, a coffee shop, 5 restaurant concepts + ice cream (coming soon), a lot of open space, and a few local craft vendors set up in the middle selling things like jewelry, candles, and handmade cocktail mixers (which are totally WINNING by the way).     

So, I've chosen to rate my experience on what I experienced instead of what I didn't.  It was cool.  We got there and ordered coffees from Tea & Toast Co, then walked around checking the place out while we got our caffeine fix.   I ultimately decided I was going to have The Kraken Bloody Mary from DCM Bar, which comes with a number of garnishes such as - pickled carrot, pickled green bean, thick cut bacon strip and, on a skewer sticking up out of the Bloody: a hamburger with lettuce & tomato, a chocolate brownie, and a solitary olive.  LOL. No kidding.  Massive assorted garnishes not withstanding, it was a great bloody mary.  

My wife decided to get a breakfast burrito from The Larder & The Delta (formerly Yard Bird & The Larder), and my step daughter decided to get a delicious (and huge) salad accompanied by a juice smoothie from Radish Salad & Juice.   

It was all quite good, and we hung out in the dining hall for quite a while after eating while I had a beer by THAT brewery and my wife had a glass of cava.    Subsequently, we bought a few things from the merchants set up near the middle of the warehouse, including some cocktail mixers from ICONIC Cocktail Company, which were not cheap but I think will become a staple behind our bar at home.   

This was our experience on a random Sunday and I will go back again, it was unique and fun.   Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Everything is great about this place BUT THE MUSIC SUCKS. No one listens to crappy 90s Alt Rock anymore, please wake up as this almost made me leave 3 stars"}
{"text":"What an awesome new place! A few months ago my boyfriend and I peeked in the windows while it was under construction and thought it was going to be a restaurant. We were so surprised when we walked in and discovered a market. (I know it says it in the name but people tend to use that word liberally.) 

This place is adorable. Nice open space with exposed brick and beams. It's very clean and very big. There was plenty of seating open on a Sunday around lunchtime. It reminded me of smaller version of Chelsea Market in New York.

They have several places to choose from - burgers, salads, Asian. I went to the Asian place and had delicious bao. My boyfriend went to the burger place and got the juicy lucy - also delish. I love that you can get different types of food all in one place. 

There were signs up saying that an ice cream place and a sandwich place are set to open soon. I'll definitely be back to try them out!"}
{"text":"Went out for weekday lunch.  Ordered the DeSoto burger with the attitude that the a $14 burger with fries is a bit over priced.  I WAS WRONG.  Probably the best burger in Phoenix.  first, it portion was huge! I had to take half home.  Second, the combination of cheese, 2 thick sliced of peppered bacon, a generous portion of sweet wine caramelized onions, fresh tomato and butter lettuce was OUT OF THIS WORLD."}
{"text":"This overpriced cafeteria really needs to figure itself out. It seems like a great bar but there is no concept for the restaurant. When you finally figure out what's going on you realize you have your food but forgot to grab silverware, napkins, ketchup...etc. Again, cafeteria style. Except you'll spend less at a restaurant and get actual plates and utensils.

Its got niftyness...just not value."}
{"text":"This place had horrible service. My girlfriend and I were going to meet up with some friends who were already sitting on the patio at 845 on Saturday night. We joined them at a table, no one greeted. They had already paid but said there was a server who was serving them so we expected someone to come by the table to see if we wanted drinks. No one came. There were two other tables outside sitting with no menus or drinks. After 15 minutes, one of the groups moved inside. We decide that was the only way to get any service so we went inside to get drinks. Bartender didn't understand the drink that we ordered, which was off the menu. Drinks were good, but would not come back. As a first impression, the service was horrible."}
{"text":"DeSoto Market looks, like others have mentioned, a shady warehouse. That being said, the minimalist vibe grew on me. Where Desoto went wrong was the food. I had the toast with burrata, peach jam, prosicutto and arugula, and it just lacked in flavor and balance. Also the crostini it was on was nearly inedible it was so overdone. I have only been here once so I can't say much about it but some of the other restaurants look really nice and I know that my friends enjoyed their meals so I may be back to check other things out. Just realize that this place is prioritizing ambiance and aesthetic over food. So if you want to spruce up your Instagram with aesthetically pleasing food photos, this is your place. if you are looking for a good, unpretentious meal, in my experience, this is not your place."}
{"text":"It's such a great idea poorly executed.  Suffering from limited selections of over priced food items.  The food quality for the price ratio is way off."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. I liked the space, it's open, unique and there is a lot of seating. We had a big gathering and were able to put two long tables together (they were on wheels). Lots of variety to choose from when it comes to food: there's a tea and coffee spot, salads, burgers, seafood, Japanese cuisine and Mexican. I ordered goat cheese curds and a Zeus salad from two different spots and liked them both. Everyone I talked to in my party liked their food as well and the prices were good with happy hour deals going on. They had a market on the first floor as well. I got there early enough to find parking but there are streets nearby with no meters. Pretty cool atmosphere, more of a get together destination than a place to study."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch as a first timer here.  It was not busy and had great food stations to chose from.  I had a small southwestern style salad while my boyfriend had a burger from the burger joint. We both enjoyed our selections.  it was a little pricey but that was expected being a \"hipster\" downtown spot. It is very spacious with seating upstairs as well, it even had a few couches.  The windows are huge and they also have an outdoor area.  It was nice that they had self serve water and one infused with lemons.  Everything seemed fresh and the staff was very polite. Ill be back. :)"}
{"text":"The space is absolutely beautiful. Nothing ive ever tried there, both food and drinks, has disappointed me! However, the ladies at the coffee shop for each times ive been there were not the most friendly, were not engaging and very blunt. Nevertheless, the coffee and tea is fantastic. I agree with others, its very over priced. $9 for a traditional small cappuccino sized drink and a cookie. The bento boxes at an other vendor are absolutely delicious but can hit the $13-$14 range for your single meal. 

Overall, great concept. However if the service was friendlier and the prices were docked down a buck or two eventually, i think it would be 4 1/2 to 5 stars! I have faith it will get there given its fairly new."}
{"text":"First time here. Got greeted right away and was explained the concept ... bar, coffee, food. Good selection of craft beers. Bar staff attentive and informative. Will come back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely beautiful inside with a vast dog friendly patio outside. 
Essentially it's a \"food court\" with higher end/local fare.

I've had a couple of burgers here and they were both pretty good. I'm not sure they were worth $10 bucks, but I'm a cheapskate. 

Worthy to note, they are just getting started and haven't filled all of their slots. So I'm assuming this place will just keep getting better and better."}
{"text":"We popped in while we were Downtown for an event. After figuring out the system and ordering and paying, one of two burgers arrived. 15 minutes later we inquired after our missing food. 30 minutes later, still no burger and plenty of folks stopped by, seemingly puzzled about the whereabouts of the burger. We were assured that they were bringing out a burger immediately, it was going to be priority -- the next burger that arrived would be ours. 45 minutes after the order was placed and after watching several other burgers walk out of the kitchen, we had still not received any morsel of our second order of food. We gave up and asked for a refund. Probably 10 minutes later we finally packed up to clear out, and were approached by the female bartender, who had promised our burger would be out next, who now seemed irritated and inconvenienced that we had requested a refund. No one apologized. We got explanations, but no \"I'm sorry\". And never any food. We were baffled at the terrible service and the unapologetic attitude. Kitchen screw-ups are understandable, but the way frontline servers handle it is key. This was a disappointing disaster."}
{"text":"We wandered in needing an AC break from walking around downtown and ended up staying for about three hours. Awesome layout with numerous food vendors and little farmers market on Sunday. Food places varied from salads to oysters, burgers and what looked like Asian fusion. Everyone was really nice and the drinks were great and cheap! We will certainly be back soon! Cool place to hang out for sure!"}
{"text":"First time here, I had an \"Italian Classic\" my sandwich was cold ! My boyfriend had a burger it was close to 19 dollars. Regular burger along with regular fries. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool. I enjoy spending time there and recommend it to anyone. There are lots of good dining choices and it makes for a cool hang out spot."}
{"text":"Interesting concept with independent food vendors surrounding a central bar area. It wouldn't be fair to review the food stalls here as I'm sure I can find them separately on Yelp and review them one-by-one.

The first time I came I was with a crew from work. We weren't sure exactly how the payment worked, so we asked the bartender. We asked if we could order from all the different food places, have some drinks and receive just one check? Absolutely! he said. No problem. Just go and order and pay him. Sounded great, except that's a lie. All of the food stalls are independent of each other and you have to pay at the Asian place, then at the burger place, then at the oyster place and then at the bar for the drinks. I don't know if he was new and didn't know, stoned and didn't care, or if he was just fucking with us. Either way, not cool.

Second visit was a bit better as I knew the rules, but nobody is really friendly.

Oh,and what's with the parking? You've got this big lot, but it's closed off. There is another lot close by, but that was full. Luckily I was able to snag a spot on the street. But why have a parking lot if you're not going to open it for the paying customers??"}
{"text":"Opening weekend impressions: 
SLOW BARTENDERS - takes forever for them to acknowledge you & even longer to get u a drink. 
Lovely patio. 
Only partially up & running - no healthy food yet."}
{"text":"My buddy and I dropped by today after hearing that Roosevelt had some pretty cool bars and restaurants to check out. While we intended to simply stop by and check out the spot, we ended up staying for a beer and left with great conversations under our belts. 

Our two servers spoke at length about Roosevelt and offered us some wonderful recommendations. They were very friendly and eager to drop some Phoenix knowledge on us. Our bartender recommended a restaurant in Mesa after, and she ended up being right on the spot! (Thank you!!)

Beers here were very reasonable at $5-$8 for selected drafts. Look out for the happy hour options too!

We couldn't try the food so I can't speak about that, but the service and ambience made this a great experience for the both of us. Definitely check them out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, but the music blows. I wish they would change it."}
{"text":"Cool setting with art, live music at times, coffee shop and awesome seating throughout."}
{"text":"WOW - became a super-fan of this place over the weekend.  They have the industrial urban feel along with a \"market\" of food and drink options to choose.  Cool concept and very fun!"}
{"text":"Great collection of restaurants, a very nice bar.  Jump inside or outside.  You can't get near the place on first Friday.

They also make a monster Bloody Mary with a cheeseburger and a brownie on top.  I'm not lying."}
{"text":"Went with friends after running a race downtown, I ordered a breakfast burrito and latte with whole milk. The latte was alright, better than Starbucks but the coffee was a little bitter and tasted slightly burnt. 

My friends got their order and after they finished mine still wasn't out. Apparently they forgot to print the ticket. Once I got my burrito it was good, but nothing special. The tortilla was fresh and there was a lot of food. 

Overall it was pretty good, but the kitchen seems a little either understaffed or just not very efficient."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, a lot. 

We came on a Saturday night and really enjoyed ourselves.  I had NO previous knowledge about the place and loved it.  It was like unwrapping a present, expecting \"just a bar\" and finding the world of food in the back.  Unfortunately most of the places were closed, so we'll have to go back during the day and when they open the other places they have slated to open in the next year.  

I will return with my boyfriend for sure and will potentially give a more thorough review. (We might even have our reception here?) Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Walked in expecting to be greeted by a waiter but no. We sat down and no one helped us so I had to ask the bar tender for info on the food. I guess there several small restaurants in the building and you can order and sit wherever you want.  Sort of like a food court at a mall.  Anyways other than the confusion on how to order the food was good. We went in there looking for the Monster Bloody Mary and it was as great as we imagined. Seasonings in the blood Mary were on point!  The breakfast burrito in my opinion was over priced at $12 each. It's a normal size burrito with a little bit of steak. 
Be back for sure but only to visit the bar"}
{"text":"Had no idea this place existed until my friend recommended it for lunch yesterday. We both decided on a salad. It was excellent! I usually don't have an issue picking out which salad I want when I go somewhere, but they all sounded so tasty. I settled on the Southwestern salad and it was a great choice. They have 2 sizes and I probably could have ordered the smaller one and still been full. 

I can't wait to come back and try more of the salads as well as the other food options they have. 

They do have a complimentary valet, but there was only one guy working when I pulled up. If you get lucky, you might be able to find street parking."}
{"text":"Awesome setup and vibe. Great place to hang out and have a drink or just work and enjoy the free Wifi. Most of the food I've gotten here has been great, especially the baked goods at Tea and Toast! However the avocado toast came with a fried egg when the menu said hard boiled so that was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this market. It's like an upscale food court with various vendors offering different selections. Seating options are plentiful on both levels and there's also a nice looking patio outside. Some notable  eateries include Adobo Dragon, Walrus and the Pearl, and Tea and Toast. 

The only real negative for me is that unless I'm taking the Light Rail to downtown, I probably won't be frequenting this area a lot since it doesn't seem like there are very good parking options here."}
{"text":"Cool cool space! I think they have a lot to get ironed out! But I don't care if the food is expensive it's not about that. Everything is great! The only thing I could say is the coffee shops toast could be better"}
{"text":"This place is great! Lots of choices and space. Though one of the vendors gave away my turkey melt and were slow at getting it out to me, it was SUPER delicious. Yum!"}
{"text":"Casual, upbeat place that offers something for every taste. Study group heaven, with lots of group space."}
{"text":"Food - 4/5 Stars - I had the cheddar filled Burger topped with marinated tomatoes, Blu cheese & a fried egg. It was fantastic! Burger was cooked just right. (My husband ordered some kind of ceviche... we were not fans of this item.)

Service - 3/5 Stars - The girl who took our order at the burger joint was nice but other than that... no one even said hello... no one offered us an explanation of their concept. Two people out of the entire staff smiled at us. The girl at the burger joint & the bartender. (The Bartender was pretty awesome too.)

Ambiance - 5/5 Stars - Beautiful. They have an interesting concept. 4 or 5 different restaurants under one roof. I love this! Open seating & well spaced. 

Price - 2/5 Stars - Restaurant prices minus the service. We made the mistake of bringing the kids. Over $100 spent on lunch. & they shared a meal. Ridiculous. W/o the kids it might have been more worth it... but as for my experience today... NOT worth it. Oh... & tips are expected. 

Overall Experience - 2/5 Stars -    because of the mediocre service. 

Total... 3.2 Stars

Will I be back? With the kids... No. W/o the kids... maybe but doubtful. 

Would I recommend to a friend? Sure, with a few caveats."}
{"text":"If negative stars were possible I would give this place an infinite number of negative stars.  At first glance this place looks awesome, then we tried to order a burger from DCM Burger, the girl taking orders was eating at the front window.  Then we placed our order, never being asked how we wanted our burger cooked.  We got the sliders took a bite and they were rare inside. We took them back and asked to get a refund since you never send food back.  Not once did we receive an apology, instead a \"chef\" came out and asked why we were bringing the food back, we explained because they were rare inside.  Then the \"chef\" proceeded to question whether or not we asked for it to be cooked a particular way, we let him know that we were never asked.  He then decided to say that he was sorry and he would talk to his \"staff\".  First things first, you never question a customer, especially when you are in the service industry.  We will never go back to this place, when we are paying for a meal I expect to receive decent customer service, last time I checked there wasn't a shortage of great restaurants in phoenix."}
{"text":"Not what I expected LOL I seriously thought I was going to something more in the lines of an italian deli LOL 
Very nice concept, think Food Court without the mall. And small local eateries to choose from (about 5 when I was there) My salad was good and the guy at the salad spot was very friendly"}
{"text":"We had a couple of hours to kill before heading home and spent all of them at DeSoto. The vibe there is great and they have games and a wide selection of food options. Because it's a very hip place prices were a bit high but altogether it was a cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"So I went to DCM burger at Desotos market. Disappointing experience with the food. My black bean burger was $11 !!  Basically just a bunch of unseasoned, mushy, black beans smashed  in a patty with tons of aioli and mayonnaise all in one.. I appreciate the fact that they dont use soy but come on! For $11?! I could have at least gotten fries with that but nope! I paid extra $4 for a cup of fries.. Ok my stomach hurst now!!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! Definitely try the cauliflower and the oyster shooters! The burger place was great too. I really enjoy having a bunch of options and the atmosphere is very unique."}
{"text":"Saw an Instagram post about a pancake brunch at The Provisionary and decided to try it on my birthday for brunch with a small group of friends. Instagram advertised that it would be served from 10:30-3pm. We get there around 10:45 and are told The Provisionary won't be open until 11, no big deal. We wait until 11 and are then told 10 more minutes until they are ready for us to place an order and also told that the breakfast that we came to try (and was advertised to be served at 10:30) wouldn't be available until noon. To top it off the people who worked at The Provisionary we rude and unhelpful, seemingly ignoring customers who were patiently waiting to try their food, it was very off putting. Wouldn't recommend, especially when there are great brunch places just down the street who amazing food and customer service. My entire group was disappointed and wished we had picked another place to enjoy brunch."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. Their $4 burger/$5 cocktail special is wonderful. I love stopping by for some food and drink while getting some work done on the free WIFI."}
{"text":"The best place in Phoenix. I'm so thankful for it but so scared for it to get too trendy and busy. I wish there was even one more place similar to this.  I want to move in. Great fun bartenders. Great drinks. Fun activity nights. So many good vegetarian foods. Should add calamari"}
{"text":"Café (right of the stairs) Short line, but long wait time. Unfriendly staff, a wood plank has more personality, but it seems that was their intended posing. Otherwise, amazing tasty treats at reasonable prices. ($2 hot cocoa? How could you not?) 10 min wait when there was nobody in line? Hell no. Great rest of the place and patio is bitching."}
{"text":"What a great concept! Super cool hang out with multiple vendors, a great bar and super nice bartenders.

We were there on a Friday night and enjoyed the patio with a DJ under string lights and by a fire. It got packed quickly around 8pm and felt like a super local hipster hang out. We loved it!

The food was ok. Wasn't immensely impressed by the options and we landed on an Asian bistro sort of place and the food was just ok. 

The place itself would bring me back for more and more as well as the bar but I'd probably get food elsewhere first."}
{"text":"I love the concept of a upscale food court in a reclaimed space since you get the opportunity to taste all sorts of neat food. We tried tapas at Adobo Dragon (asian-latin fusion), dishes at Larder& The Delta (southern with a modern twist), and drinks from the DCM bar. 

The patatas bravas and the albodinga meatballs from Adobo Dragon which were both delicious and had neat flavor combinations. 
The fried quail and the roasted brussel sprouts at Larder & The Delta were both amazing -- you must try one of their dishes when you visit. 

The space also houses Tea & Toast  which serves coffee/teas and sweet & savory pastries. as well as Walrus & The Pearl which serves oysters and wine, as well as a salad and fresh juice stand called Radish.

Some of the restaurants have a little bar you can sit at, otherwise it's food court style seating in the open space, though they do find you somehow and serve you your food and drinks. There's also an upstairs space and large outdoor courtyard which are great for large groups/parties.
 
The place will also be very complete of the ice cream shop ends up opening inside.
I'm not sure why it's labeled currently as a \"grocery\" as it definitely is not one at this time. 
 
Most of the places have happy hour, the hours of each are a bit different, but if you come M-F 3-6pm almost all of them have happy hour deals, including $1-2 oysters at Walrus & The Pearl."}
{"text":"Great concept, bad execution. Beautiful building, lots of potential, the food choices are slim, and coffee bar treats are something you'd find at Duncan donuts. Tried the DCM burger, overpriced, but nothing special. A cup of fries for a side should not be $4. Good seating choices. This place can only survive in Phoenix which lacks urban hangouts. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great idea, but empty af. I went on a Sunday afternoon at 4PM all the vendors except 1 were closed. Also, the kid working at the walrus and pearl was super rude about being closed 4 hours earlier than it should've been, and seemed to busy since he was hitting on some whack drunkish girl (1 of 5 people in the entire place) who said I should come back and try the lobster rolls. Ugh, anyhow nice idea, but they need someone who knows how to manage it. Not just \"wing\" it, and make up your own hours."}
{"text":"Stop by any weekend for a KRAGEN... a pitcher of spicy bloody mary and it is -pickled veggies, beef slider, celery, olives..."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and I love it! The staff is always inviting and friendly. I really enjoy hanging out at DeSoto Central Market, the decor could be a little more homey, but otherwise I am very happy with this place! The DCM burger joint/bar has some great craft beers on tap, I love the White Rascal Wit. I have tried the poutine, (which is AWESOME), the DCM burger, and the 40 garlic clove chicken - all fantastic! I have not been disappointed! I would definitely recommend and I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I actually found desoto on wedding spot. Desoto is a very cool place. Any of the food I have tried there has been good and the service was always nice. I actually loved this place so much that I was going to have my wedding there. This is where things went very wrong. In the 4 months I had been in contact with them, I had spoken to 3 different coordinators. I had started to get concerned when it was taking a while to get responses to my emails. However, the breaking point for me was when I was totally ready to sign contracts to book my wedding with them and asked for an events estimate, after waiting 3 weeks, and tried to touch base via email, I finally get a response from a new coordinator who tells me that the cost per person for catering literally doubled to $100 per person. Honestly because I really loved the place I would have paid it had that been the original quoted price and if I had confidence in their ability to have an event like this. Not to mention, for me to have a wedding there, I would need to rent tables and chairs as well as linens and decor. Again all of which would have been fine with me. They just clearly don't know what they are doing when it comes to hosting a wedding."}
{"text":"This place is so unique and the food and coffee is really good. The employees are really nice and I love the set up. It's a very laid back atmosphere too. The prices are a bit high but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go for good food and relaxation!  The vendors sell qualitybproducts and the atmosphere is very quaint.  Bring a book....have a coffee.....do a little shopping.....even have a meeting ...... you will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Cute place but definitely not enough seating. They have a variety of foods to choose from so you can be vegan or carnivore and still find something to eat. We are at Radish ( really tasty) and got fries from the burger place ( they were perfectly crispy and salted). 4 stars because of the seating. If you get more seating I would rate 5."}
{"text":"This was my first time at DeSoto, and they were so helpful! I probably asked a million questions, and they answered them all for me. The food was good, as well! There are lots of seating options, whether you arrive alone or in a group."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous salad with steak. The cocktails were very nice. Was pleasantly surprised that they had the free water station at the entrance. That is a really nice feature to have in Phoenix.  Plus it kept the bar service moving faster as well.
The fact that there were multiple food stations to choose from it's really nice. I was with the group of 20 people and everybody could choose the own food that they wanted and pay for their own individually. We sat up on the mezzanine level. Where it was a little bit quieter and we were still able to converse. We were there for about four hours and had a fabulous time. I will definitely recommend going back to this place. I look forward to trying some of the other food stations."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  I've gone a couple of times -- once for a business meeting and once for pleasure.  Ordered breakfast from Larder.  Had mimosas from the bar.  It's just a cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's usually busy during first fridays when everyone goes out. I love it because of the different choices in cuisines. So whatever you're craving you will be able to find something. 

When I go, there's parking in the back. It looks like an alleyway, but it's parking for that area. I go in and get a drink at the bar.

Lots of walking space, and on first Fridays, there are tables of people selling jewelry and stuff. My favorite is the oyster bar and the filipino Chinese fusion place. There are seating upstairs as well."}
{"text":"Desoto has been one of my favorite places to go to work, eat, and drink. I always went to desoto to work and have a drink, especially when my favorite bartender was working- I think his name is Matthew. I just found out that he is no longer at desoto and I became so sad. He was a super chill bartender that made desoto a great place to work and hangout. I will give this place 5 stars because of Matthew, he was amazing hopefully they will get bartenders like him again."}
{"text":"I've been to Desoto quite a few times now, and overall, I like it. The space is gorgeous, and there's ample variety. I've tried the burger place, Tea and Toast, and Adobo Dragon, and I've been happy with all the food I've had. I also like that you can kind of sit around and linger since seating is pretty ample. 

However, the customer service could be a lot better. Everyone I've encountered here seems so put off by actually having to help you. I was here during a bad rainstorm a few weeks ago, and there was a huge leak from the rain. Some employees definitely saw it and did nothing. No one even bothered to put up a caution sign (it was kind of hard to see the water since it was dark and the floors are dark). Someone ended up slipping and falling pretty hard...and still no one did anything for a good 5-10 minutes.

I also think they need to make the concept a little more clear to people who might be stumbling in for the first time. I understood the concept before my first visit, but several times I've heard/watched people enter and have absolutely no idea what they're supposed to do.

Overall, I think this is a great addition to downtown. If they can work on their customer service, I think it would got a long way towards improving the experience."}
{"text":"The market is in a great location and very cute inside. The patio is a great place to sit and eat food. Inside there is a selection of multiple places to eat, like an upscale food court. I wish I had something great to say about the food, but it was very unimpressive for such hefty prices. I had wished for more."}
{"text":"The food here is hit or miss. Mediocre customer service but the atmosphere & huge outdoor patio make up for it. A little over priced in my opinion, but the bar usually has good drink specials."}
{"text":"Such a fun place! I love the selection of foods here, it's perfect for s group of friends who might all have different taste. 

Friday night they have a live jazz band and many people come out for the fun! While I do not participate I love coming, grabbing a drink and relaxing! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yes please! This place, the environment, the drinks, the food, all great! I came here on  Sunday and made it a fun day for sure. But don't come early in the morning. Things did get going until around 11ish."}
{"text":"So many different vendors here. Wonderful spot for a quick bite or a shared bottle between friends."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food only the atmosphere (but we do have something to say about the sanitation of one - that will be addressed on their page). Not our cup of tea. Interesting concept but DeSoto definitely hasn't \"arrived\". The markets in Seattle, Milwaukee, LA have it nailed down and this place could learn much from them. It's lacking in vendors and, honestly, the prices are quite high considering what it is ($9 for a beer in some places and $40 for 12 oysters - whattttt?! this isn't a higher end restaurant). Other than the pricing, I'd say it caters to more of a 20-something crowd (which is ok!) as it has a communal vibe offering board games and wide-open spaces to eat your food, enjoy drinks or hangout. 

We walked in on a friday night to a loud band playing (fun!) but there were literally 20 people max in the entire very, very large space. The band and the precisely chilled Grapefruit IPA on draft at The Burger Joint was great - literally the perfect temperature and freshness. That's all the positives that we can attest to. We definitely expected something different, something better."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. Great patio, clever concept, amazing server, etc, but I am a little outraged that they charged us for an ice cube. Am I missing something? I have never been charged for one before. Check out the bill --but I believe we paid 1.50 for an ice cube. 

I am pretty are we won't be back. There are other choices."}
{"text":"Tried to come in this evening and was rudely waved away. They said they were closed but the sign clearly said they were open till midnight. We asked again if they were open because the sign said open till midnight and they just waved us to go away again like we were bothering them. Finally a woman came up to us and explained that they were closing early. I would have appreciated that answer instead of being shoed away like a fly. No wonder this place was dead. Customer service sucks."}
{"text":"Great A/C to get away from the Phoenix heat. Various food booths to try out. Limited parking if it gets busy."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Desoto Central Market. It's got a fun, open air, industrial vibe to it. The outdoor patio is huge and has some games (bags, ping pong, fooseball). There are two main bars (one inside and one outside) that sling everything from craft beer and cocktails to the good old standbys. Sunday mornings/early afternoon, they've got some great mimosas. I'm not sure if it's their weekly deal but when we went they offered a bottle of champagne and orange juice for $15. Not too shabby! The bar service is friendly and helpful when you're being indecisive (which I often am). In the back there are several eateries including the recently opened Huss Brewery Tap Room to choose from. All are delicious so you cannot go wrong. If you've never been, definitely check it out. The days are more chill, and the weekend nights are hopping"}
{"text":"The restaurants here are not great. However, the environment is great. I enjoy the outside patio, bar and upstairs space to actually enjoy a conversation with a friend. It's a great after-work spot as well. I would highly recommend the happy hour burger for $5! Drinks are good & beer selection is on point. Overall, a good place for a happy hour/beer with good friends!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at DeSoto and I really love the concept of a \"food hall\" with all sorts of different places you can eat from. There is a good amount of seating too, indoor/outdoor.

I chose to eat at The Burger Joint and I got the Sinaloa burger. My husband got the Desoto burger. My burger was cooked well & stacked with lots of tasty things (avocado, carnitas, fried egg, pickled cabbage) and the fries were definitely on point! Crunchy and fresh.

Bar service was definitely lacking though. When we went, the bartender said we could only get wine or beer because they couldnt mix cocktails due to someone else not showing up for work. Thats the main reason for my rating because you cant really get the \"full experience\" without the bar.

Also, parking is limited, so I would definitely reccommend to carpool/lyft/uber unless you want to feed a meter.

Overall its a cool spot & I would probably give it another chance."}
{"text":"Great environment for work or play. Great variety of food and drinks. Service is nice and quick as well. I've only tried Adobo and Burger Joint so far."}
{"text":"Love radish, I got q salad and a juice and it was amazing. Such a cool building complex, if I could design a house I would make it look like that:)"}
{"text":"What a fun place! Literally a two-floor indoor market with lots of seating, different vendors, and a great atmosphere! Was so great to visit on a Saturday morning! Upstairs is a bit quieter where people can study and get away from more of the noise. Downstairs has seating and a lot of different vendors putting out good food and other stuff. Awesome place for a meet up if you are looking to get a group of people together! Parking was easy as they have a private lot. However if it got more busy, you might have to park on the street."}
{"text":"A Great destination for foodies, Desoto Central Market offers a lot of variety for a bargain price. Have tried the Yard + The Larder which was outstanding and the Burger Joynt's Desoto Burger followed by a chocolate chip cookie from the coffee shop which was splendid. Overall a very positive experience - Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! There is a variety of delicious, well prepared food. The options range from a cafe to an awesome burger joint, to authentic Asian and even an oyster bar. After you order your meal you can stop by the bar which is loaded up with a tremendous selection of beers and cocktails before plopping down (inside or out on the patio) and enjoy your meal in a great atmosphere. The prices are pretty moderate, but the food quality is excellent. And hey, there is a ping pong table! I am definitely planning to add myself as a regular here."}
{"text":"Holy Cuteness, the was an old building they turned into a restaurant. The restaurant is made up of 5 little different restaurant types on one side and large bar on other. Super cute."}
{"text":"This place is awesome food is amazing- here lies the problem - at the end of the night there is no food - so when you walk over to Fez and leave your car parked at desoto - there are no signs --nothing that says they will lock your car in there parking lot- this other poor couple did the same thing and were very angry needless to say this dd had to uber home and will have to uber back in the Am to get my car- where are the signs??? Very disappointed- by the way the staff told us Fez was open. Wth?"}
{"text":"Great Place and location right next to light right. Reminds me of a old police station upstairs and a fancy LA restaurant downstairs. It has food from all over... It is a market. Grab a drink and join us here."}
{"text":"Variety in quality menus, public market style ambiance, and cold craft beer. Whatever not too like?!?"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for my first time and upon walking in I knew this wasn't my type of environment. It was a Saturday, so obviously it was packed. I don't like craft beers so this definitely was not my kinda place. Inside they have little restaurants where you can order and they'll give you a number to hold on too so they can drop it off to you. So, I have my purse in my hands, the water I had to fill up myself, and this number stick I have to carry to my seat. I almost dropped everything- Friend got oysters so had to wait for those to be ready at the counter, waited for like 15min and my burger came to me, so now I had my purse, water, silver wear, and my plate, this was ridiculous and all before I was at the table. The burger came with a COLD bun.... COLD!! Like it just came out of the fridge. The meat patty was paper thing, HUGE bun and lots of vegetables, the ratio to bread, meant, and vegetables was ridiculous. I took the bun off and just ate the meat, this was mediocre.... Worst burger I ever ate. They didn't ask how I wanted the meat cooked either. $13 burger? Savages- I want my money back! To throw your trash out you have to touch this disgusting bin to open the lid while carrying all your crap, it's like seriously, you gotta have tentacles for this place. Never again will I come here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy the experience at this place but when I went there for lunch the only place that was open was the Bao at the Dragon's lair and some juice/tea shops. My lunch buddy and I came here craving oysters and they where closed. The Bao that we did eat (pork) was really delicious but not filling for the $10+ we spent on two baos.
Unfortunately, I will not be coming back to this place since I was very disapointed from the first time."}
{"text":"Love the concept! 
Can't make up your mind but you're oh so hungry and you need a drink but what?  Deco bar greets you when you enter and if you're confused by what you've stumbled into just ask. The staff at the different vendors were excited to share their eats or guide you to one their fellow vendors to ensure that you don't perish. Asian, Latin, vegetarian, burger, pastry, coffee, tea, cava, beer, farm-fresh, local, gluten-free....yes! It's a magic land that will accommodate you. Just wander and you'll find it. 
Enjoy the patio or indoor seating-it's whatever you'd like to make of it. If you need to work off some of those calories there's even a cornhole setup for after eats playtime. If you're still not content there's probably something wrong with you."}
{"text":"Lots of great, tasty options within this modern, hip space. Between 3 and 6 p.m., though, I always have to get The Desoto Burger, the bar's $4 happy hour burger. It's amazing as is and all the more at that price. Good Patty, tasty bun, succulent caramelized onions, aged cheddar, fresh tomatoes... You just won't find a better burger at that price!

I wish I could post a photo, but I always finish off that burger before I think about it!"}
{"text":"Here is what you need to know. 4$ giant bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun. Happy hour. 

For real, this burger is delicious... onions soaked in wine, cheese, spicy ketchup, tomato.... insanity. I ate half and took half home, ate it 2 days later and it was still amazing. 

As for the rest of the place, the drinks are alright, the happy hour includes a 5$ cocktail of the day, which is a decent deal. The space is beautiful and the concepts inside have all been fairly good (except the coffee shop, not my fave). I'll definitely be back here for happy hour- I believe it's mon-fri from 4-7, but don't quote me. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is such an interesting concept. It reminds me of a mall food court with an urban twist. The specialty drinks at the bar have hilarious names, I had a Becky with the good hair lol. For dinner we went to the Asian fusion restaurant and got bao buns which were to die for! The pork was my favorite and my boyfriend got an albondigas bao which he loved. Great vibes and a fun place for a casual night with friends."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go during lunch time during the week if you want multiple options.  Breakfast sandwiches from Tea and Toast are pretty solid. 

Do not come here on Saturday mornings though because they have a yoga class that takes over the whole place, making it impossible to have a conversation or work on anything."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today to the burger place.  Just an all around great experience.  Started with the greatest counter girl/cashier.  She was super helpful in guiding me through what to order to share with a friend who was running late and on a time crunch.  She was super pleasant and efficient.  Great start!   Settled on the sliders and fried zucchini.  SPLURGE.  Same counter girl brought my food TO me at a table which I could see wasn't the norm as lots of people were standing by the counter waiting for their order to be called out.   My friend and I shared the sliders (that were fabulous) and the zucchini was cooked perfectly.  We will definitely be back:  Outstanding service and great food.  Can't wait for it to cool off, so we can enjoy the patio!

  Update:  I've been back several times.  I REALLY want to like it here.  The burger place still has the same great cashier, but WOW- they are ALWAYS out of things.  I don't get it. 

  Cheese curds today?  \"Oh, not today\".  Ok, that burger with bleu cheese- \"Oh, we are out of bleu cheese\"...  Ok, actually, I'll go with the black bean burger then.   \"Sorry, out of those\".  They just won't make it with that lack of ability to plan.  Who wants to look forward to their food only to be told 'Oh, out of that\".  

 And why all the random activities/special nights?   There's yoga, there's a farmers market, there's beer pairing nights, there's prohibition nights, there are charity events.    You all need to decide what you ARE and run with it.  Get a FOCUS and make it happen!  There is no reason why this place shouldn't be packed- great parking, great location, great food (when it's available), free wi-fi.  No one knows what to expect when they walk in.  Will they be able to get what they ordered? Will there be some random 'event' going on?  Do I have to stand and wait for my food or will someone bring it to me?   How about trying lunch specials and actually having all ingredients on hand? I don't think anyone even knows you all are open so early and have breakfast. You guys need a new marketing director."}
{"text":"Cool concept: expensive considering the premise is all these places share rent. Having two floors does give it a nice open feel."}
{"text":"Went to DeSoto Market today for lunch. Great building. That's about it. 

Ordered lunch from \"The Yard Bird.\" Ordered the Pork Sandwich, Turkey Sandwich and the Cauliflower appetizer. Over $31.00 total. Took about 10-15 minutes to get our food even though no one else was there. Sandwiches were less than marginal and we did not receive our appetizer. Tried to get them to credit us for the appetizer but they couldn't do it so they comped our lunch ( with an attitude). 

Overall very underwhelming. Poor use of space. So much more could be done. Doesn't look like there is an overall management staff. We aren't going back. Too bad. Could be so much more."}
{"text":"Paid $10 a piece to get in. Waited 20 minutes standing at the front of the bar never even got acknowledged. Asked door person for a manager who never came. I would have gave zero stars if I could have. They were not overly busy either."}
{"text":"Desoto has been open about a year now and it only gets better & better!

I do the Handmade markets as a vendor occasionally and Daina is great to work with!

I love how they add events all the time: garage sale, dancing, yoga and workshops!

On Friday night I enjoyed a burger & fries from The Burger Joint. The burger was cooked so it was nice and juicy! Super filling! The fries are delicious! They seem like freshly cut potatoes. You could probably share a side. 

I ordered a well margarita from the bar & it was hand shook & strong! Very tasty.

There is a lot of seating! Long bar tables in front of the Windows for people watching, private secluded tables upstairs for introverts and deep conversations, and right in the mix tables, to meet people.

I am also just obsessed with the interior brick walls! Old red brick is the best! It sets the character of this old fun building."}
{"text":"Close your eyes and imagine the following: you and your pal decide to try something new. They want coffee, you want local craft beer, this place wants your money. You open the door and you walk in, you don't try to but upon first entering you can't help but catch a whiff of farts. Maybe someone was a jerk and crop dusted you? But you venture further into the establishment and it still smells like farts. Whatever. Your pal gets their London Fog (also the name of the band they used to be in) and you get some beer. You decide to go to the second floor and play some pool while you wait for Brad and Brittany to vacate the couch you called dibs on. You get to your couch and chill, laugh at memes, and then all of a sudden it SMELLS LIKE FARTS AGAIN!!! Anyway, place is chill and it's our new spot in case anyone wants to hang out with us, but in case you still don't get it, it smells like fucking farts."}
{"text":"Really neat space.  Had the BEST tea latte ever! ...the Larder + Delta has some novel offerings.  The Cauliflower was good, but a tad oily.  Not a fan of the chicken. Good taste, but I hate dark meat . The burger @ The Burger  Joint looked good. Their fries were divine.  Overall the best thing was the tea."}
{"text":"The concept is amazing as well as the building and interior design. But the service is scatterbrained and inconsistent. You are in downtown Phoenix. Don't expect everyone to look like they just came from Arcadia or Gilbert! The service is sorely lacking at this point. No one to make sure our food was prepared correctly or that we even had silverware. And by silverware I mean everything there is disposable which also bugs me. If I wanted to be 'waited' on by careless hipsters I would go to Mill Avenue. I brought a large group there because I spoke highly of it and they wanted to check it out. The bartender knew this but still made me feel like my businesses was no big deal. They were not busy."}
{"text":"First off, SUPPORT LOCAL SHOPS!  DeSoto had a very cool and unique vibe, loved the building and what they did with it inside.  Every restaurant we ordered from had excellent food; ingredients were fresh, tasty, and unique takes on some classics.  The entire building was very clean major plus!  My only knock would be the flow: having to order at individual spots is a great idea but everyone in our group was waiting at separate places and the times varied by 5-10 minutes depending on how busy each spot was.  Then we had to go up the stairs to a table while some people were still waiting, etc...  Outside of that the place is solid; definitely check it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Absolutely the funnest place I've ever been to I'm a big fan first Fridays art walk in Phoenix it displays the culture and the diversity of the  city of Phoenix Arizona and every time I'm in town I will always great food the De Soto now is fantastic by Bison burgers ,fresh fish sushi and shellfish is at your disposal at this place"}
{"text":"Great building with great potential. Tried out Radish, adobo dragon, and the tea and toast place. Very pleasantly surprised by all of them. The place is very clean and everyone there seemed super nice and eager to help. The busing staff was really on top of stuff. I can't wait till the other stalls are open. I look very forward to going back and trying the other spots there."}
{"text":"umf. yep, upscale, over priced food, understaffed, long wait food court.  Music was too loud inside and out... once you go on patio the door locks from the outside.
  I bought a beverage in a can ... was told to go to another booth to ask for glass and ice.
The other booth said no they did not have a glass however, my friend ordered wine in a can and was given a glass ??? what???? waited and seeked for about l0 minutes before I got a glass.  Don't like the concept of milling around to booths and waiting waiting until some one can assist and then they do not assist :(
ugh.  will not return... like eating in a warehouse"}
{"text":"Very cool space, not a lot of food options. I liked the juice place with the free samples. The space is pretty amazing. They need live music upstairs or maybe they have it when it is not First Friday."}
{"text":"DeSoto - one of the few places on this blue planet we inhabit where you are confronted, but not defeated with the embarrassing conundrum: is this a chip or card reader?

That example is the bedrock of DeSoto. It's a place that makes questions from large to small simple. So many things can go wrong with a place like this. So many things are happening behind the scenes to make DeSoto the alluring environment it is. It's a medium sized space offering the following: a full-service bar with any drink this side of the Mississippi; food vendors that range from the traditional hamburger to ramen; and vendors that sell their wares. It could so easily drop the ball.

Instead, everything fits together like a 1000+ piece puzzle. Whenever you go, you never fill overwhelmed by choice, or pressured to visit that vendor selling wares whose clothes you've been eyeing. This place just isn't a hassle. It's a calm delight that's a nice break from the hustle and bustle of downtown.

I rarely go with people to De Soto. It's kind of a retreat within the city to gather your thoughts and just relax. You can kick back and read The Notebook or The History of the British Peoples. If that's not your jazz, feel free to bring your friends by and have a study group or a small get together. Somehow, the interactions you're having, whether quiet or loud, never intrude upon the other person there. It all just works in a way that's hard to find.

DeSoto is the much needed retreat we all need in a city. I love this place."}
{"text":"It's trying and it's trying hard, which I appreciate. I'm looking forward to seeing this place develop and mature. The main gripe I have about the bar at DeSoto is BAD service - every single time I go. It takes forever to get a dink. There is no sense of urgency from the bartenders. All of my friends have corroborated this on separate occasions, so I know it's not just bad luck. 

I love the concept of this place, and the food has been good, but expensive at all of the vendors  - from the coffee place to the salad place. I love the layout, the free WiFi, & the abundant water. 

The burgers are great, the bao from Adobo Dragon is delicious and the salad place has a great variety as well."}
