{"text":"Meh. Food is bland. I don't like spicy, but I expect Mexican food to be flavorful. Have been here several times with friends and it misses the mark on many dishes. Service is prompt and friendly, though."}
{"text":"Cheese Dip was amazinggreat flavor! The food was excellent! Great service, I felt very welcomed \"just like home\"  The Mojitos were just right! Love the decoration !!"}
{"text":"The place serves good food but except for the manager Raul; especially the ones working in the back that don't do their job:
#1get service with a previous use coffee cup
#2waiters forget always some item like tortillas#5

#3go in about 12 or one jus to eat Caldo and their out; what's the use of getting UP.
#4 maybe I should try to understand that Raul can't be there all the time to hold his employees hands when he puts his trust on them to do the best;NO PRIDE AT ALL"}
{"text":"I'm so happy with my meal today, I was craving Mexican food and this hit the spot. I had a cheese/jalapeño tamale and cheese enchilada combo plate. The masa was perfect, the sauce was delicious, a bit more mild than I normally like but delicious. Service was excellent. Staff is attentive and has a great personality and food came very quick!"}
{"text":"Great place amazing food. People are so friendly and great costumer service, they make you feel you are at home. I highly recommend this restaurant. Big 5 stars this place is super clean. I never have to wait for service, everyone makes sure that you are taken care of."}
{"text":"I've been twice.  First time was really good, second was not.
Ordered the chicken carne burrito both times; first time was loaded with nothing but shredded chicken and guac - perfect, second time it was a 4oz portion of grilled chicken in a 12\" tortilla - not good.  First time the Corona Light (on special) was cold and very fresh, second time it was barely cold, no head and stale.
(5+2)/2= 3 stars, rounding down.  We'll go again and I'm hopeful for a repeat of the 5-star."}
{"text":"2 thumbs up! Great service n sumptuous food all the time!! Fajita is my favorite! Will definately come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place . The tortillas are hand made . This place does get pretty busy . However , I love that they make fresh fruit water . Also known as \"agua de sabor \" same thing just in Spanish lol . Any way they make it to order. Maybe I was a little more excited about the mango water . But the food is good as well."}
{"text":"Fresh and great taste....
-7 mares caldo OMG!!! BOMB!
-Homemade torillas
-big Portion
-home made aguas frescas
-Great service!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has to have the best staff I've ever seen, they're so friendly and attentive. The food is just as amazing as the downtown location, just with a more modern feeling. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Por primera vez puedo recomendar un restaurante mexicano con Exelentes servicio y un trato amable y una excelente recomendación por el mesero de esa noche las carnitas fue lo mejor el mesero fue eficiente y atento a nuestra petición la verdad recomiendo a CASA DON JUAN SUMMERLIN y por supuesto a su mesero JOSE HERNÁNDEZ muchas gracias."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and staff is very welcoming. Kyle is awesome, very attentive and kind! He would make a great server!"}
{"text":"My husband and eat at casa Don Juan's at summerlin
A lot the food is so authentic and delish.
I love the chicken mole and fajitas. My husband loves the chicken burrito. And there breakfast is just as yummy. Chorizo and eggs, I love machaca and eggs .
Oh ya and home made tortillas mum.
Have not had a dish I didn't like it's all good!!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and delicious food but the waitstaff needs a little more training. I'd still recommend it to anyone wanting authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The food and service was Great... I highly recommend this restaurant.... The manager made my experience great... Try the jalepena cheese dip"}
{"text":"We decided to try a New Mexican restaurant and were very pleased with this location! Great service, great food and a very clean and festive environment! We will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Anything here is delicious. Order the cheese and jalapeño with your chips, it's a good starter."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there and it was the worst tasting food. My beef taco tasted like fish and burnt oil, my beans were cold and my rice was hard, his burrito had a hair in it and had a fishy taste to it aswell. The service was terrible, they never came to check on us. Both of us got so sick I couldn't get out of bed and he couldn't off the toilet."}
{"text":"Wow!! Just wow!! I've never had an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant that I belong to until tonight!! Not only that, it's so close to my house!! Amazing food, amazing service, and their own tequila brand is to die for. You can taste the amount of hard word that goes into this tequila. I started with the guacamole appetizer which was amazing and the homemade chips to boot. My girlfriend had the 2 enchilada plate with chicken piled high with rice and beans. Absolutely delicious!! I had the chile relleño, beef taco, and beef enchilada. It was so much food, but I devoured it!! Our server's name Billy and he was on point and an amazing salesman. We were trying to save room for fried ice cream but there was just no more room. Can't wait to come back next time!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they decided to open another Casa Don Juan near Summerlin. The staff is very attentive and the food is awesome! I had the carne asada and it was cooked perfectly, and was still moist. Most places cook it until it's tough and dry. There are only a couple of decent Mexican restaurants on this side of town. Casa Don Juan blows them all out of the water. I don't see going to any other Mexican restaurant from here on out, I'm hooked."}
{"text":"We have been in Las Vegas for 5 years now and have been looking for a truly great Mexican restaurant. We finally stumbled upon Casa Don Juan on Main Street, which we loved. Now the Summerlin restaurant opened and I think it's even better. The service is consistently wonderful, the food perfectly delicious. I love the outdoor patio and large booths in front. The bar area is fantastic. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Coming from California where there are a ton of great Mexican food restaurants I didn't think a Vegas restaurant would compete.. I was wrong. This place is awesome! The service was top notch. Our waiter Jose S. was one of the best waiters ever.  Great job!!"}
{"text":"Today I went to have lunch at Casa Don Juan Summerlin, my experience was very good with the food, since I ordered chilaquiles and they were delicious, as well as the attention from the manager on duty."}
{"text":"So this happened about 5 months ago but whenever I pass by there I can't help but think about my experience there. So I was with a group of 8 and we are all young adults (18-21). It was Friday night and I understand that they are very busy. I think they were automatically biased with us since we were young. The service wasn't great. My friends never got there water after telling our server multiple times. When we asked to get more bean dip and chips the food runner acted like it wad the hardest job ever. And it took a while for our food to come out. Now I understand that it was a couple months ago. But that one experience makes me not want to go back with my friends if we receive that service again."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the most authentic restaurants in Las Vegas. Their service is excellent! You will have to try the shrimp and steak fajitas. They also have their own Tequila that is imported from Mexico! Very smooth! :)"}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan Summerlin is staffed by a very friendly and efficient crew, and the food is great!
I started going to the one on Main Street, a very well established restaurant and just like the one in Summerlin, great food and service.

You get attentive service from everybody, including the owner Raul, a man with a lot of experience  in the restaurant business and customer relations; you will not be disappointed and will have a very good experience.

Even 5 stars don't seem like enough! 
Enjoy! (I do!)"}
{"text":"First time visiting this location.  Food is good as always but the service was outstanding, Nancy and Mirna were very attentive. Loved the home made flan!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding as always! I have really enjoyed everything I've had here or at the one on Main. You've gotta try one of the cocktails, my favorite is the Vuelve la Vide- abalone, shrimp, octopus and mussels. The chimis, tacos, enchiladas, rellenos, puerco en chile verde are all great! It may be a little pricey for the location, I recommend Groupon."}
{"text":"Just ok. The original downtown is better, maybe they just need to work out the bugs. Weak margaritas..."}
{"text":"Great food! Service was slow but it was Mother's Day, so it was understandable. Pretty good at keeping the chips coming. Enjoy liquor, the bartender has a heavy hand for the margarita!"}
{"text":"We were seatted with the hostess getting chips snd guacamole then after waving down servers for water and another server to order drinks. Finally after waiting 30 minutes a server came to take our order.the pork chilie verde flavor was perfect but I haf to cut over 1/4 of fat from the prrk. I wouldn't order it if I ever come back. Unless the fat was removed.  The carne asada was great. #4 rellano & enchilada doesn't meet with our standards. The Flan is grainy, not our idea of a good flan. We wouldn't come back. Too bad we had hoped we finally had a good Mexican Rest. In Summerlin. It's not Don Juan's.. And we were still presented with a full check. Not comming back."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and got chips and queso and got home and container is half full. $7.00 for that."}
{"text":":-) you must try the Fish Platter for two or four.  Loaded with  whole mojarra, shrimp prepared several ways, tilapia, and more."}
{"text":"Such a welcoming restaurant, service was very good and our waiter was on top of things. The food was also very good and flavorful, chips and salsa yummy. No complaints we will def return!"}
{"text":"Staff and servers were very friendly.  Enjoyed the chips, salsa and beans they brought at the beginning.  We ordered the seafood plate for 2.  Definitely plenty of food, but nothing stands out... Would have given 3 stars, but added one for the homemade corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Definitely will come back! 
Absolutely love this place and their food is really good , service was great Mr Lozada took good care of us... Y'all need to come here and eat real Mexican food"}
{"text":"Did a work lunch here and no complaints. The food was tasty, the service lovely and the place was clean. Next time I'll make it an after work visit so I can try their margaritas!"}
{"text":"Like  always,  a exelen service  and terrific food.  With the touch of  the owner coming around the table and made sure that everything is going good. 
This new location at Buffalo is awesome. 
Thank you so much  to all  of you for the exelen  service  on father  day."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see this place open up in the NW.  For weeks we would drive past and say we can't to try it. It's got a good rep from the downtown location.

The moment of truth: we walk in and were greeted quickly. We got our table in about 10 min. The busser asked for our drink order. 5 min later the waiter comes and asks if that's what we ordered. Mind you it was water a magarita and a chocolate milk. 

We ordered our food I got a combination enchilada Chile relleno and a taco. The taco was very greasy. Oh we asked for spicier salsa for our chips and we got charged 3.99! The enchilada tasted as if it was from a frozen package. My husband ordered the beef tongue. He asked for flour and corn tortillas and they actually only gave him one of each. When he asked for more they charged us for it. Never in my life have I been to a legitmate Mexican restaurant that charges extra for salsa and tortillas. And the kicker is every time we asked the busser for something like that salsa or those extra tortillas the waiter always came to our table and asked if we wanted that.

It was a huge disappointment and we will never go back. Service, food, atmosphere, and prices are why we will never go back to this location. I wish I could give it a 0."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my chicken fajita salad....will be returning again and again.  Nice clean restaurant with pleasant atmosphere. Food seemed very fresh, service was prompt....salsa very tasty...I always judge the restaurant by it's salsa....this one definitely passed."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this no stars! Went on a Friday night around 8:40pm and service was so slow. We order preparada's and it tasted like straight tomato juice and beer. They didn't have the family platter that we wanted so they recommended the fajita platter. The shrimp was  dry and cold.  We also order a chile relleno. It was so cold that the cheese wasn't even melted. The other location is so great, we had high expectations. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Don Juan's Summerlin and all 3 meals were excellent! This will now be our new Mexican restaurant. Service was excellent also and very friendly people."}
{"text":"If you are planning to eat at Casa Don Juan you better wear a snow suit. The hostess was going to seat us in a booth next to the front window, so I asked if we could sit somewhere warmer.  What about that room in the back, I asked?  She said that room is closing (Two hours before closing time?!?). We got seated right behind the reception desk, first table as you turn the corner where every time the front door opened we got a cold... COLD blast of air. It happened to be 31 degrees outside and we thought a warm bowl of Cocido in a warm cozy Mexican restaurant would be nice.  BIG, I mean \"BIG\" mistake going to Don Juan in Summerlin.  Where the hostess frowned when I asked to be seated in a warmer area. The waiter made a joke when asked why it was so cold in there.  And looking around everyone left their jackets on while they ate, just like me?!?  I kept asking if they could please turn the heat on and they said they would, but it never came on. Leaving, I told the person at the register, \"Your food is very good, but too bad I'm never coming back.\"  Telling her about the situation she apologized and agreed that it is too cold in the place. She is the only employee that didn't look at me as if I were crazy!?!  In parking lot we asked a couple walking out what they thought and the wife said she had to drink six cups of coffee just to keep warm. Suggestion:  Casa Don Juan owner, TURN UP THE HEAT!!!  YOU ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS...Don't be so cheap!  (Cold @Main Street too!)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas! The Carnitas is my usual dish, but I've tried most of the menu at the original downtown location. Chips and salsa are delicous. The fish dishes are always fresh. My wife loves the shrimp tostada for something on the lighter side. She also recommends the Cadillac Margarita! Muy bueno!! This is a family owned, local business and it shows. The service is always on point. A friendly staff always welcomes you upon arrival. Best in Las Vegas for sure!!! Forgot to mention the flan for dessert is always perfect. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to both restaurants for years stop going to downtown one after several times they burn my fried shrimp didn't complete cus I felt more embarrassed me telling the owner Raul which we've known over 9 years so was happy to see him open the summerlin area went there took our daughter she ask  for coffee her cup had lipstick stains on it wasn't wash right then went early one Friday think was the week Raul daughter got married they didn't have caldo not even 11am they were out this I notice happens only when the owner is not there service sucks they are all in the back talking laughing and us customers have to ask the hostess if they are in a meeting cus no one has even come to our table they weren't busy cus it was only us and a couple of other customers just want to give a heads up to the owner that his employees don't work the same when he's away like I say when the cats away the little mice will play and that's not good for the business food is good but its sad that Raul or Maria have to be there in order for employees to stay on top of things"}
{"text":"I've know this family since the late 90's when they had a small location on Main Street. The quality has always been excellent both in food and service. We are thrilled that they have opened this new location in Summerlin. I love the cheese dip and the seafood dishes are excellent."}
{"text":"La comida super rica, pedi un vuelve a la vida y muy rico, el sevicio exelente lo recomiendo es un lugar muy limpio y la comida fresca un ambiente totalmente sano y de muy buen gusto"}
{"text":"I've gone to the downtown casa Don juan for over a decade and really enjoyed it, but for families the summerlin menu is absurdly high for what you get.  For myself (one entree) and two kids the price was nearly $70.  That's ridiculous.  Granted I had two margaritas, but the kids meals are ridiculously expensive for what you get and don't even include a drink.  We didnt even think to ask if the kids drinks were included, because what restaurant doesn't include them?  What casual restaurant charges an arm and a leg for a generic kids meal and doesn't even include a beverage.  We won't go back for a family meal.  Food is fine, but not worth the price.  You think when you spend that kind of money for an adult and two kids you're getting appetizers and desserts, but no....  never again."}
{"text":"Authentic food and great service. Can't top the hand-made tortillas! Truly fun,  and personable staff. We're from out of town, but this will be one of our fave spots!"}
{"text":"Great food! It's convenient that this location opened up, I'm in this area all the time. I ordered a regular burrito with Asada. One issue I had was my burrito didn't come with pico and I didn't receive the green sauce i asked for. Wish the service was a bit better, but it wasn't too shabby."}
{"text":"Amazing, friendly service, all the staff were very attentive, our glasses were always full, the food was delivered in a timely manner and was delicious. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were here on a Sat night during a big soccer tournament in January. Take note that a $ deposit is required. The staff was accommodating with our large group reservations. However, at arrival time 4 of our families had to wait for their tables to become available. It took awhile. Food: bean dip is awesome. Carne asada wet burrito was great but on the salty side. Drinks: good margaritas n beer. Service: the bill was a bit of a mess but they really try to satisfy. We had two birthdays to celebrate and it was so fun and entertaining. Definitely a great place for birthdays."}
{"text":"I spent $70.00 for two adult meals and two kids meals. One meal was fajitas, they did not bring tortillas with it. When I asked for the tortillas they refused?!?! The enchiladas tasted like limes. Horrible customer service. The quality of the meals was no where near the $70.00 I spent.
 Will never eat their food again."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful end to a bad week.  The food was fantastic the customer service was phenomenal just everything about the restaurant was perfect. Best in town."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!!!

EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISk!!!

My client from China was in town and wanted to eat \"Mexican\". We decided to go here as my gf has previously had a good experience at the downtown location. 

The place was virtually empty with only one other table occupied. We ordered quite the spread, from guacamole, to the sea food sampler, tamales, fajitas, enchiladas, burritos, enough food that the waiter asked when the rest of the party is arriving. 

Oh, how can I forget, we also order 2 horchata's and a water. 

The water came out quite fast, but after a more than 5 minute wait, no sign of the horchata. I got out my seat to ask the waiter where the other drink were (it was a little awkward with my gf and client watching me downing my water with our chips and salsa). The waiter told me that it was coming out shortly as the current batch \"smelled sour\" and that a \"new batch is being made\". 

I accepted his response and went back to my seat. A few minutes later I saw our waiter come out of the kitchen with the two glasses of horchata. 

Before he approached our table, he stopped to speak to the manager. The manager then proceeded to take one of the glasses of horchata off our waiters tray, smelled the horchata, then proceeded to do the absolute most unthinkable thing, he took a sip of the horchata, placed the glass back on the tray, and nodded yes to the waiter. 

At this point my jaw dropped to the table. As my mind was still processing what just happened, the waiter came over and served the 2 glasses of horchata to our table without hesitation.

I looked at the waiter and asked him what are you doing serving these to us? I said no one is drinking these, nor are we eating anything here! (The waiter looked at me and realized that I saw what happened). He said he was \"sorry\" and asked me to    \"allow\" him to \"deliver better service\".

By now, I was already standing up and telling my gf and guest that we're leaving. 

Never got to try anything beyond the chips and guacamole and Las Vegas tap water.

*Health Department complaint was filed*

Now, You have been warned!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years now. The food is very good, and comes in big portions. This is the best bang for your buck. All of the food is great."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican restaurant in town! So glad they opened a second location close to home. The food has so much flavor and never disappoints. We will be going often!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the location in the Arts District for years but hadn't tried the Summerlin location until recently. It definitely lived up to my high expectations! The food is great, the service is incredible, all around one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and came here for dinner and were greeted by a very friendly staff, our server, Jose S, was promptly at our table serving us our happy hour drinks and chips, salsa, and beans :)  I asked if they had a vegetarian/vegan menu, or what they could offer for vegans.  We were told they could do a veggie burrito no cheese no sour cream, or a bean tostada no cheese no sour cream.  Sounded great, so I ordered the bean tostada, and my husband ordered the burrito.  The food came out within a matter of minutes, if even that long.  It was the fastest service I have ever experienced, so quick that we hadn't even really tried the chips. After we received our food we inspected the plates, we noticed that the beans on my husband's burrito were whole beans, and my tostada had refried beans.  This is huge red flag to us, as some restaurants still use lard in the beans.  We asked Jose if there was lard in the beans and he confirmed that there was. Well, I was unable to eat my tostada after that, never even took one bite. It looked great, I'm sure it was, just not for me.

My mistake for not asking about the beans before we even sat down. Been vegetarian for over 20 years and made a rookie mistake; lesson learned (again).

The chips, salsa and beer were great!  My husband offered part of his burrito, I declined and stuck with chips, salsa and beer.  He said his burrito was good.

I, in no way fault Jose, as he was extremely helpful and attentive!  I just wish we would have warned about the animal lard when we said we were vegan.  

It's really too bad, because my husband and I would have been regulars, as we really enjoyed the service and atmosphere of the establishment, but we will not be returning.  There are many Mexican restaurants in town were we can eat.

Over the years, I have seen this location change from different restaurant to different restaurant.  I was really excited to try this place. I wish them the best."}
{"text":"The service was excellent here, very attentive staff that was very courteous. This made the dining experience good however the food is why this place failed to get a 5th star from me. Aside from the technical flaws of placing lettuce there burritos which just ends up limp and soggy there was bean dip that had no flavor, just blended up beans and the chips were cold and had no salt. Also they have no happy hour which makes no sense in the area its in. Overall this place is good and should do well but it needs to work out the flaws, I  will eat here again in a few months and see if they have earned there 5th star"}
{"text":"Compared to Lindo Michoacan, Casa Don Juan, service was excellent. Did not wait along time for any of the service. Food was great and I will return."}
{"text":"Food was good but grossly overpriced. 

This is why the place can eat a d. The staff just laughed in front of my kids when their claw machine wouldn't release the ball they won. That's when I lost all respect for this place. Staff just said there was nothing they could/would do. No refund or anything. Sorry, but to kids a prize from a claw machine is a huge deal and the staff's lack of empathy for them is pathetic."}
{"text":"This place is extremely authentic and DELICIOUS; best everything I've ever had--the chips, tacos, guacamole, bean dip, rice, etc. Each bite was better than the last; highly recommend."}
{"text":"To start off, we knew that there would be a wait to be seated as it was Cinco de Mayo and we were going to a Mexican restaurant for dinner. It took nearly an hour to get seated. We should have known it was going to be a poor night and the staff at the restaurant did not disappoint. It took about 20 minutes to place or drink order and when it finally came out, they forgot my drink. I had to order it again, nothing fancy, just a Diet Coke. There were 6 of us there for dinner and we had to ask for additional chips and salsa rather than it being offered. We placed our orders and finally got our food. What a joke. They spread the beans out in a thin layer on the plate to make it look like more food. The chili rellanos looked like a kids sized chicken finger and the ceviche was like shoe leather. The fajitas had no flavor. Every item looked like it came off a kid's menu. We had to send 2 plates back and have them removed from the bill they were so under cooked.  First, and definitely the last, time I would ever set foot into this price gouging poor excuse for a restaurant. Poor staffing for a holiday, poor wait staff, poor food, poor judgement on our part to stay, overall a miserable experience. It was so poor, I had to re-install this app just to warn people.

Not to mention a 3:30 am wake up call with stomach cramps and diarrhea. Lovely time."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago. Food was pretty good. Service was ok except the waiter offered me to do a 1/2 red and 1/2 green sauce on my chimi. I thought wow, what a great option. Unfortunately, what he didn't inform me of was that there would be a $2.50 charge for this. WTH? Why? Same amount of sauce, just a different type. Hmmm, that left a pretty foul taste in my mouth. Not sure if we'll go back. I realize $2.50 is not a huge amount, we spent more than that on their watered down margarita's, It was just the principle."}
{"text":"Service was slow, food took forever to arrive, two of the three dishes were cold, need a new place"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of trying new places but the husband had been wanting to go. We got seated right away but it took a very long time for someone to come by and ask what we wanted to drink. I got a lime margarita which did not look or taste like one. It was gross i ended it up drinking the Hubster's beer. Food was whatever , we almost died of thirst since no one really came back to check on us. Food is pricey and not worth the 50 dollars we spend .  I would not recommend this place to any of our family or friends."}
{"text":"Cuisine has ALWAYS been excellent. Presentation - great.  Service also excellent.
We like to come in for lunch and have their luncheon special at $8.95 a plate.  Usually have to take home some of the left overs - as they are very generous with their portions.
We used to go to the original Casa Don Juan downtown near strip - still will if we are in the area - but are so happy to see that they have opened up in Summerlin!  Ask for Jose as your server - you will be very pleased by his quality.  ALTHOUGH, everyone there REALLY TRIES
THEIR BEST TO GIVE YOU A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE.  Try it - you will not regret it!!
The new restaurant has been nicely decorated and has great options for seating also.
We love the carnitas, fish tacos & their La Mexicana CDJ  salad.  Their salsa is fantastic, as is the bean dip. Freshly made tortillas and great fresh not-greasy tortilla chips for a starter."}
{"text":"I have never eaten here before but it is one of the restaurants listed on UberEats.  I don't drive so I was very happy that this restaurant is on their list.  I was really craving Mexican food and they didn't disappoint.  The food was still the perfect temperature when it arrived.  They even gave me chips and salsa.  I had shrimp in garlic and butter sauce which is the best outside of Mexico and it was served with rice, beans and tortillas.  I will be ordering from them again very soon."}
{"text":"Went in for Happy Hour and ending up having  dinner. My chile relleno was just so-so, I like mine with hot, melted cheese in the middle surrounded by a light batter-and this was not it. I was surprised when I got the bill at the price of my margarita. It tasted like mostly mix- like it was a .99 cent one at the casino. My hubby had the taco salad, and he said it was great!"}
{"text":"This is the last time I order from this restaurant. I ordered food for delivery  and neither the hostess, nor the manager cared the it was not only delivered extremely late but cold. The manager stated that it was not the restaurants fault it was Grub hubs.  I called Grub Hub to get more information and come to find out, they don't use drivers from Grub Hub only their ordering service. I do not recommend Casa Don Juan to anyone."}
{"text":"Visited Vegas from Phoenix with family from Dallas. We all wanted Mexican and found Casa Don Juan.  This is NOT Tex-Mex.  This is NOT fast food.  This is GOOD, AUTHENTIC SONORAN MEXICAN food.  I had shredded beef tacos - house-made tortilla deep fried and filled with tasty beef and other traditional toppings.  Top notch beans and rice.  Homemade salsa and bean dip served with house made tortilla chips.  Fun (gaudy) decor, fun server/manager, great prices.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have admittedly only had a few dishes, but all have been good. I have eaten the beef tacos and guac a few times and it has been awesome every time. The seasoning in the beef is delicious. 

The atmosphere and liveliness of the servers adds to the experience. Every time I have eaten, the servers have been very personable. 

Great location and great addition to the west side of Vegas."}
{"text":"Aye Caramba indeed! If you want a thick ass tamale that tastes like God blesses it with salsa verde and corn, then this is the place to freaking get it on 

My ass crack fiancé was smitten, SMITTEN by the tamale quality and the quest dip. Make sure you order that damn quest it is well worth the arbitrary 2.50. Hell, I'd pay 6.50 for that liquid crack. 

Anyway, these fine folks know what the fuck they are doing and the beans we do good and I don't even like beans! Very tasty with those damn addicting chips.

Happy eating all!"}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves 5 stars! The service was exceptional, the food was delicious and the environment was cozy. They have great happy hour deals as well as specials during football season. If you like Mexican food and drinks, you'll love this place!!"}
{"text":"It's bad when you walk in and can tell someone hates their job.. Nancy in the bar seemed extremely impatient and unfriendly. I wanted to order more things but I literally didn't because I didn't want to ask her anything. Talk about driving business away..."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love going to casa don juans. We always have the most amazing service from Jonathan! He always remembers us and our orders even after my fiancé was gone for two and a half months !! Excellent food, huge portions and very prompt service every time."}
{"text":"I took my date her for an early lunch on Sunday. This was her first time here, so we started off with some  cocktails and the casa don juan appetizer for 2 people. It was great. It gave us a variety of things to try. My date was so impressed by our server and the hospitality. Even the manager came over to greet us. She was so kind, and even gave us some recommendations to try.  All and all great service. Great food. Defiantly will be back, most likely same time and day, just so we can have the same experience again."}
{"text":"The service and food are amazing!!!  I absolutely love the chips, salsa, beans, and guacamole we had, but the choriqueso was just over the top delicious!!! Especially with the homemade tortillas!!! This is definately our new favorite place for happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Any restaurant that honors Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera is worth checking out. You don't really expect authentic Hispanic in Summerlin, (no chipotle doesn't count white folks) but this place was great. People that think it's just average are probably to used to having a Baja blast with their burrito to know any better. Take it from a brown guy, this place does it right."}
{"text":"Food was VERY fresh, came out really quickly, and was delicious. It's hard to find good Mexican food in Las Vegas, but Casa Don Juan did not disappoint. The table chips and salsa were pretty good also., but that strawberry margarita was AMAZING. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Very good food a little pricey for lunch but good
The Flan is great and the place is spotless friendly
People would go again"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was horrible. If it wasn't for the food quality it would not be a two star. They didn't have our reservation...,after arguing they magically did. They messed up all areas of our order. Had to repeat requests multiple times. Had to request attention on refills. Meal comes out and then they let one in my party know what had they ordered was not available. Then gave them the wrong order even after substitution- blamed them for touching the food that wasn't meant for them after delivered. Ridiculous event the whole way through. Going back to Michoacan. Never coming back here. They made us feel like the problem and when leaving was informed they were understaffed that day."}
{"text":"The customer service here was definitely one of the best!! I noticed a couple of the servers treating some of the regulars like family. He was teasing/playing with a kid, it warmed my heart to see such a thing in a restaurant. The food was delicious and fresh. I had a wet carne asada burrito and couldn't get half way through it. If you haven't been to the summerlin location definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Fajitas are definitely so huge you can share the single serving, and DELICIOUS!!! I had the Camarones a la Diabla- absolutely wonderful! Spicy, sure, but not too much. First time here, we'll be back - guaranteed!! Service was awesome, very very attentive. Recommended."}
{"text":"We ordered pick up from this place.  The food was sub par. The order was missing items that we paid for.  We called to be refunded the money for what we did not get. They asked us to drive all the way back so they could swipe our card again.  Ridiculous to say the least!  When we asked them to simply put the money back on our card it took them 4 hours to figure it out after we gave them our card number 3 times and 5 phone calls later. So eventually they said they returned our money but in fact what they did was charge our card with the difference removed. So now we have to wait until the bank decides to give us the original charge back which can take up to 8 business days. We went from a $40 charge to a total of $73 charge because they failed to fill the order as placed. What a complete shame. 

Please don't take this review as a sign not to eat here. We just didn't enjoy the food or the experience we had with them."}
{"text":"Brought the majority of our soccer team and parents over for lunch between games. 

The restaurant was accommodating for our sudden arrival and seated us all together in a large section. The waiter, Juan, was on the ball. We didn't run out of anything. With Manuel, his first assist, they ran a smooth experience. 

The food was also wonderful! Flavors and technique made this such a pleasurable meal, I would gladly return."}
{"text":"It was good authentic Mexican food for a reasonable price. We shared the chicken and steak fajitas, delicious"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! I was impressed. We will definitely be back! Robert was our server and he made great recommendations and was friendly. Thank you Robert."}
{"text":"The best mexican food i have had in Vegas besides my Spanish daughter in laws home made. Now open one up in Henderson 
Highly recommend to anyone who loves Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"This was a very good restaurant. The food was fresh, hot, and served timely. The staff waited on our table and provided good customer service. Overall, this is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow we love this place! the food is excellent, everything tastes so fresh. Nice decor, and the service is excellent, very attentive on refilling drinks, clearing the table etc.. The waiter we keep getting is fantastic not sure of his name but very outgoing and hillarious hehe! One of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! I've dined in and also ordered on Uber Eats, both experiences were marvelous. Their Tres Leches is good also."}
{"text":"Didn't even make it to the food bc the first 15 minutes in this place was awkward as hell. We walk in to be sat but there's apparently an employee gathering at the hostess stand, so we are ignored by 5 employees for 2-3  minutes before we're taken to our table. After being sat, we are greeted by our server who seems nice but then another server comes over to basically tell him to take a hike bc he's taking our table. He did it right in front of us, causing some tension between the two & the new guy seemed to be kind of a dick with an ego. Then I start looking at the menu & EVERYTHING is so overpriced! We just left. It was just awkward.... Felt like they didn't care how they present their restaurant or themselves to their customers. I spent my money elsewhere that night......"}
{"text":"Let me start of with the service. Let me tell you it was excellent. We grabbed a table outside and enjoyed the nice weather. The only drawback was the bees by the flowers. 

We ordered a margarita and had chips and dip and it was really good. The margarita was actually pretty good also and pretty strong. 

I had a wet burrito and my boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas. All was amazing and should have been since they make their own tortillas right there in the front. 

I definitely will be going back again because i really enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Got a to go order for hubby via Amazon restaurants. Free delivery.

Got his usual Vegetarian Burrito (no cheese, no sour cream...they always exclaim \"no dairy\") and I also wrote that he wanted it wet. With red sauce. Didn't come with sauce ok whatever.
The burrito was cold and he said it didn't have the same flavor as usual. He heated it up and ate it. 

Side of beans and side of rice were warm and their usual taste.

I ordered lemonade and took my chances on it not being sweet (I don't eat sugar) and it wasn't. It was strong lemon water and I loved it. 

Hubs wanted mango juice. I tried it and while yummy...wowza it was sweet af.

I ordered guacamole and it wasn't in the bag, oh well. No chips and sauce option...and the order came with none.

For fun I ordered a pineapple raisin Tamale. Wow it was weird and pink. I guess it's a flavoring in the masa. It was sweet and had a chai like cinnamon spice. Tossed into trash.
It honestly tasted just like a fruit cake!!!!!

It was fun to order but now we know that the location Downtown is better and it's better to go in and enjoy our burritos."}
{"text":"Same great food as their downtown location. EXCELLENT service.  Staff couldn't be nicer."}
{"text":"Happy, friendly and awesome food.
Thanks for a fantastic meal and great service. Easy to find right off Buffalo in the Sea Breeze Shopping Center."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy this place the food is good and the service is good.  We enjoy the breakfest there as well the huevos rancheros are excellent.  Being latin I am picky about Mexican food but this is good. This place use to be a place called chips and salsa before casa don juan moved in and chips and salsa was not good.  So it is great to have a Mexican restaurant in the area. Just one thing to beaware of is hidden charges which is the only downer
 They offer cheese dip or guacamole but fail to tell you about an extra charge for it. So just ask if substitutions and extra items are an extra charge.  The food is very good though."}
{"text":"Accommodating Staff, Delicious Food, Beautiful Live Music!  We will definitely recommend Casa Don Juan, Summerlin to friends.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here today (Monday) and made it right in time for their lunch special. it starts at 11 and ends at 3. I had 2 chicken red-sauced enchiladas with rice, beans, and a soup all for a very reasonable price. Omar was our waiter today and he was very prompt with getting our margaritas and food to us. These margaritas were the best margaritas I've had in awhile. what a good way to start off my week :) I would recommend this place to anyone and I do!"}
{"text":"La atención fue excelente, desde que llegamos nos hicieron sentir muy bien, Mirna y David el mesero nos atendieron de maravilla. La comida me gusto mucho, todo recién hecho, rápido. Las tortillas de harina calientitas, hechas alli mismo. Lo recomiendo para ir con las amigas a pasar un rato."}
{"text":"The original place use to be fiesta and chips and we loved it, it has since been taken over by new owners. The two stars are for the servers. Omar was my server and he was very attentive and nice, and there was another young man that was helpful as well. The thing that kinda bothered me was when we came in it was slow so all the servers were just standing around and it made me uncomfortable because I felt like they kept staring. The menu is much more expensive. My son loved the nachos from the previous owners so we decided to give theirs a shot, and I got two fish tacos. The tacos were about the same price but half the portion size, and I was super disappointed with the fish. It was tilapia but had a super fishy taste. I ended up taking it out and putting the meat from my sons nachos and putting it in my tacos. Wasn't super wowed."}
{"text":"Food is as good as their other location on main st. I have two grips about this location. One: You are packed in like sardines. Two: The noise level is horrendous. The service is good, but this is the first time I've eaten at a restaurant and left with a headache. Not certain if I will eat at this location again."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent. The waiters kept checking in on me and my girlfriend. The food was good as well. The prices aren't too bad either. We'll definitely come back in the future"}
{"text":"Went to dinner on Friday 12/15 around 6:00 pm.  The hostess asked if we wanted chips and salsa and guacamole. I said yes to all. The chips and salsa came out, but the guacamole didn't come out until we were almost done with our dinner! 

Food was good for the people I was with, but came out wrong for me. Asked for a vegetarian burrito enchilada style as a meal, and the tortilla was cold, only enchilada sauce came on the burrito, no cheese. When I told the bus boy that brought my burrito out that I ordered it as a meal he said the sides cost extra, so I said never mind (even though I ordered it as a meal).

Before dinner came out I told the nearby server in the same section as our server (since I couldn't find my server) that it was my Dad's birthday and if they could please bring out a dessert but not sing. They never brought him a dessert. 

We saw our server twice total, it seemed like he was too much in a rush when we did see him. Lots of different people serving the table, and the communication isn't there. 

I won't be going back, the service was probably the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican restaurant! Food is delicious and authentic. The owner is really friendly, he not only came to talk to us but other tables. The decor is amazing as well."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places on main street so I was excited to see one close to the house..and once again higher expectations were met...Great Service with fabulous food....awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and margaritas.  The service was really fast.  Our waiter, David, was courteous and friendly.  He made my friend's birthday into a celebration."}
{"text":"Absolutely my wife and I's  favorite Mexican restaurant. Either location is awesome. Food is fresh and the service is excellent. Strongly recommend/"}
{"text":"Great food and used to be a favorite. Lately service has gone down hill and the owners started charging for complimentary chips and salsa. Hopefully, they stop nickel and diming their guests and get back to great food at great prices. Fingers crossed! Good luck Casa Don Juan."}
{"text":"Large busy Mexican restaurants are hit & miss with good quality and service. Don Juan's on Buffalo was the excellent. First visit. Authentic. I had chicken en mole sauce. Sweeter than I'm used to but excellent. Great margaritas without silly boutique prices. Fast friendly service. Planning our next trip."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this location. The staff was not very attentive. The server took my husbands drink order and then just walked away. I had to wait ten minutes for him to come back so I could order my margarita which came after we began eating our meals. The margarita was not very good. I much prefer the location in the art district. It seems commercialized and not authentic. However, our food was good."}
{"text":"The food was a little meh, but the atmosfere, the service, and the drinks were on point, that alone deserves this 4 stars. Thank you Casa Don Juan."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here and it was decent. It was 20.00 for the appetizer platter which had a variety of different things. It was all pretty decent in taste but coming from California my taste in Mexican food is a little different. I will say that the delivery was quick but everything was stacked on top of each other so it did not stay well. 

There was guac but it was a little runny and lacked flavor for my liking. Would I order this again for delivery....probably not unless I was going to have a party and feed a few people with it but I will probably order from here again."}
{"text":"A bit pricey... and some items are not as authentic Mexican as they should be. However, great food and great service from David!! The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and staff is dressed well and so pleasant!"}
{"text":"The margaritas are quite good but the food is just ok. I wouldn't go here again with other options available but it was fine."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. My family and I went here for breakfast and were greeted immediately by staff. We were seated promptly and they staff immediately took our drink orders. The food was great (I had the Huevos Rancheros) and priced appropriately. The server was very friendly and we never waited long for anything. Overall we had an enjoyable experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was so good! Authentic real Mexican food! David and Alex were superb! Great service, very friendly! Huge menu, had the wet burrito and fajitas! Would definitely go back when I'm back in LV."}
{"text":"The most delicious Mexican food I have had in a long time. Highly recommend Casa Don Juan for two. Ordered delivery through GrubHub and was pleasantly surprised by the fast and seamless delivery. Would definitely order again and pay a visit to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Same place as the one downtown. Pork chile verde is the best. Tortillas are fresh and homemade. Great service. Glad to have it in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The atmosphere is always fun, the team there is very friendly."}
{"text":"Newsflash to management: you're no longer downtown, your prices need to come down like $3/dish. I don't know how you can call it a lunch \"special\" when your choice of ONE taco or enchilada, with rice and beans, is $11. Even a burrito is $10, and it's $2.50 to add cheese. Ridiculous.

Got a $10 order of nachos with carnitas and they were mediocre. Chips were super greasy, as if they were dumped directly from the fryer into the box. Carnitas were simultaneously fatty and dry. 80% of the toppings on my order were pico de gallo.

I guess their prices have to be high so they can keep paying their enormous staff: anywhere from three to seven employees were behind the front desk during my visit. They easily outnumbered the customers, and yet bickered over who was going to take my order.

TLDR: Overpriced & overstaffed."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Customer service always on point. Greeted with a smile and full of warmth. Very attentive service. Came more than once to fill our glasses. We had our food quite quick and everything was hot and fresh and very tasty. Portions are nice and right for the price. Just love this place"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good Mexican restaurant with a bar to eat at, this is my place! Mayra makes the best margaritas! The food is always good!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!! We had 11 people and David handled separate checks like a PRO! The staff worked together to make sure we were all satisfied, and we were BEYOND!! The food is spectacular as well. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out Casa Don Juan at the Summerlin Location which is closer to my house. I walked in not knowing to go to the bar or dine in the restaurant. I was eventually greeted and decided to go in the bar. The hostess could maybe smile more and greet. Minor point. Service by the bartender was prompt and pleasant. I got the guacamole which I always do. I have to admit, it was a little more creamier than previous visits at the other location. While waiting for my main meal, I notice how clean the restaurant is. I recieved my enchiladas and rice. Came out piping hot and it was delicious. I ate all of it. 

Kudos to the staff and owners.  You have another hit."}
{"text":"Ive been to all the Casa Don Juan locations and they never disappoint, the service is beyond great. Today we had my moms 85th birthday celebration and what wonderful service we had. Our waiter was hilarious and all the staff so accommodating! The food is always consistently good. Wonderful place, cant say enough about the service!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and Jose Maria and Kyle were awesome!! Thank you so much :) they did an excellent job! Thanks for my birthday surprise as well with a giant sombrero and tasty shot of tequila. We Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Found this Mexican food restaurant because it was close to our hotel ... what a terrific find!  The atmosphere, service and food was everything we could hope for in a dining experience. They serve chips with salsa and beans. We also ordered guacamole and white cheddar sauce. Highlights: red enchilada sauce, beef in the tacos, fried ice cream! We will definitely make this special restaurant a regular stop whenever we're in town!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Second time at Don Juans, my husband and I love this place. The owner or manager is really nice, he has greeted us at the door both times. This time he was waiting outside opening the door for this guests. You don't find genuine customer service like this anywhere. I'm not sure if they are all related cause they work together like a family! 

The guacamole is super fresh and has a nice citrus bite. I had the fajitas and they tasted awesome! They also have a person making tortillas right there so you know they are fresh and you can taste it too! We also got to take advantage of happy hour which is from 5-7, 2 beers for $5! 

We will definitely be back, we live over 20min away but it's worth the drive, trust me ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome food. A little expensive but worth it. The service is awesome and so is the shrimp cocktail. Also 2 for 5$ frosted cold mug beer. Thank god they are here because El burito was getting old."}
{"text":"Wow!!! All around great restaurant. From the second we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and our waiter Johnathan. The restaurant is full of color and old pictures very very festive. Johnathan suggested a margarita for my wife which she loved and we ordered tacos and enchiladas. Amazing great tasting food. Finished it up with fried ice cream. We're excited to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Very friendly servers and hostess. Sad that's there's no breakfast after 11:00 am. My shellfish allergy prevents me from eating/rating the chips but my friend said were good. The bean dip and salsa were tasty. She had machaca w:/eggs and house made tortillas- yum! I had a torts with chicken mole, so good. House made bread, good toppings and the mole..... Heavenly. It's so hard to find good mole, this is the best I've tasted in town. Word is they have a good Happy Hour as well- worth checking out."}
{"text":"Probably be best Mexican restaurant I've been to out in here in Vegas hands down. I love the bean and salsa dip they serve. You order, and your food is delivered in about 10 mins. They have FAST service. It's amazing. Their house margaritas amazing, too. Not to mention, those hot Latino boys in those tight pants! Butt for days! Definitely a restaurant to enjoy. A little on the pricier side."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times, as we live nearby. Their food is always tasty, no matter what we have ordered.
HOWEVER, this review is not just for the restaurant. Its for the stellar staff of C d J.
Ate lunch there yesterday, with a friend from out of town. I was playing with my ring (its custom-made and I saved for a long time to get it), because my fingers hurt. I must have taken it off, and forgot to put it on, when our food came. It got left behind :-(
This morning when I noticed, I frantically called every business and friend I had been to yesterday. When I finally called Casa don Juan, I had all but given up hope. But the nice lady there said, \"Yes, I have it here.\"
We tried to offer her and the staff member who turned it in a reward, but they wouldnt accept it. So we promised to write a review and eat there more often :-)
Which we are glad to do! Their carnitas finally gave me a reason to use the word \"unctuous\". My friend raved about her cocido soup. My husband loves their seafood. Not to mention complimentary chips, bean dip, and (yummy) salsa. This is not the cheapest Mexican food in town...but its a \"destination\". Wonderful Mexican decor. Sweet waitresses dressed as Frieda Kahlo, and jolly waiters dressed in mariachi-type outfits. AND a lady who turns out endless fresh tortillas from the griddle at the center of the restaurant. Go for happy hour to get a price break on drinks; or order their authentic (non-alcoholic) aguas frescas. And be sure to ask what desserts they have....and save a little room for one :-)"}
{"text":"Spur of the moment Mexican food restaurant selection was perfecto!  

To drink, I had the Horchata.  To eat, I had the #18 - Bistec Ranch.  It was the best Bistec Ranch I have ever had thanks to the recommendation by our server, Jose Sanchez.

Go get some, yum, yum, yum!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Lunch on Wednesday. When they say authentic Mexican food they mean it! It is lick your plate good! From the freshly made tortillas, that you can watch be made, to the atmosphere my husband and I could have stayed all day. Ask to be seated with Juan! He is hilarious! Will definitely be making this a regular eating spot!"}
{"text":"Pork Chimichanga was flavorable and hot.  Everyone enjoyed their dinners which included tacos, fajitas and enchiladas. Chips, salsa and refried beans made for good appetizer. Great service - very attentive. A little expensive for Mexican but overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I saw a picture of the carne asada plate and a chile relleno on Yelp, and both looked amazing. That's what drew me in. I dragged my boyfriend here for dinner 12/13/15. It was around 4pm when we arrived, so we were seated immediately. Chips, salsa and bean dip were brought to the table. Nothing to write home about, just cheap fillers.

My boyfriend was a bit under the weather so he wanted soup. Our server informed us that they do not serve soup on the weekends? Huh? I think there may have been some confusion because I have never heard of that before. Usually, soup is served on weekends only and not during the week. Plus, there were 4 or 5 different soups listed on the menu. I wanted to clarify, but he had already decided to get something else. He ended up choosing the beef fajitas, and I chose the carne asada plate. We also got a chile relleno to share.

The chile relleno was $5.99 and it was tiny as hell. I didn't like it AT ALL. The cheese was not even melted inside! It didn't look anything like the picture, which was a lot bigger and much cheesier. Super disappointed with that, and at $5.99 it's a total rip. The carne asada plate looked good though. Lots of grilled onions topped the steak. The steak lacked a bit of seasoning, but was still good and perfectly medium as I had requested. The onions really added an extra depth of flavor when combined with the steak. The rice and beans were meh. I don't usually like Spanish rice anyway, and this was no exception. The beans were the same beans from earlier, just with a sprinkle of cheese on them. I did like that the tortillas were homemade, they were really delicious. 

The service was pretty crappy. Our server was running around the dining room, so I knew he was busy, but we unfortunately suffered because of this. Our waters went unfilled for quite some time, and he never came back to check on us. It wasn't until we got a bus boy's attention that we were finally given service. He kept apologizing and telling us that he was sorry for the lack of service but they were going through a shift change. I appreciated his efforts. Finally after our server came and cleared all the plates, it was another 10 minutes while we waited for the check. This was totally not okay. I will not be back. For both of our meals, it was right around $45, with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Jose L is the best server we have ever gad here..
it was a great experience and we truly enjoyed ourselves..thank you for being great"}
{"text":"Awesome place, super friendly staff!!! We were greeted warmly by Obaselia and taken to our table.  She asked if we would like guacamole with our chips and salsa, then let us know Jose would be our waiter. Jose again greeted us warmly and took our drink order while we checked out the menu.  Great menu with lots of choices,  food came out quickly after we ordered.  Man, the food was great!!!!!! They hand make all of the tortillas for their dishes, boy, you sure can tell difference.  We have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant since leaving LA,  seven years ago, and I have finally found it,  in good old Summerlin. Casa Don Juan is a few months old, it's a must try place if you enjoy mexican food. If you're on the east side of Vegas it's worth the drive.  Thank you Casa Don Juan,  we will be back soon! !!!!!"}
{"text":"Placed an order through EAT24 to the tune of $67.63. Waited over an hour for our food to be delivered before I decided to call this was on a Sunday evening. When I called they told me that it would be another 10 minutes!!! Again, after another 45 minutes I called again, at that time they told me the driver had already left with the food a half hour ago. When the driver got here, it turned out to be a friend of my son's.  He informed us that once he got to the restaurant, they kept him waiting 45 minutes once he got there!  We tipped him $8.00, only to find out, that they didn't include our two soft drinks and our chocolate cake! We will never Oder from here again!"}
{"text":"Not coming back. Everything was runny. Food is over priced. Try to explain to owner pork chile verde; the sauce had no flavor, is runny and could only taste an un seasoned pork. Service was amazing, but the food kills it."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to enjoy a great meal whether it's just for two, or with a group of friends and family.

This is the second time I have visited Casa Don Juan and they did not disappoint!

The food is authentic, the customer service is friendly, and the drinks are amazing.  We were a group of four and they sat us down quickly on a busy Friday.  We enjoyed everything from fajitas, burritos, and enchiladas, and it was so good!  We topped it off with some dessert and coffee and hot chocolate which was a favorite.

If you are looking for a Mexican restaurant with great food, drinks, and ambiance...this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have lived in Las Vegas since 2009 and it's hard to find a good Mexican food restaurant. I'm just a good ol Texas boy who knows what he's looking for. Still not like back home. But it hits the taste buds right where I need it. 
The chips and salsa are top notch. I like that they give you bean dip too. The guacamole isn't is good as the ol ladies. But the best thing they have is the white cheese dip. 
They have a couple waiters who are really funny. And I have never had to wait really long to be seated. Sometimes it takes a while to get refills so I usually compensate with ordering a tea and a water. The food is good so I don't mind. 

Try either this location or the one downtown. Both are good I just like to spend my money at the location closest to my house."}
{"text":"I am new to Vegas and was craving Mexican food.  Decided to try Casa Don Juan at 1780 N Buffalo.   This restaurant is on a bus route and easy to get to.   The service was excellent.  The food was good and the atmosphere was great.   I noticed that they make their own tortillas.   I am from Texas and really miss Tex-Mex.   The food here was good but not as good as what I can get in Houston.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Casa Dom Juan for many years and I am so happy they opened a new location near my house in Summerlin,  the outstanding  service and quality of food is all ways consistent,  this is a family owned restaurant and there is always a family member there to greed you. I highly recommended it.

{"text":"Went to Casa Don Juan's last night on the recommendation of my husband, who had visited once before.  We met some friends there.  Big disappointment!!  The service was sub par and the food was nothing spectacular.  I ordered the Chicken Mole, asking the server to substitute a small salad instead of the rice and beans.  The salad didn't come with my entree - I had to remind the waiter.  He didn't say there would be an extra charge for the salad which was comprised of lettuce, tomatoes and shredded cheese.  When the bill came, we saw that they charged me $3.50 for the salad!!  I mentioned it to the waiter and he just shrugged his shoulders.  The food pales in comparison to Frank and Fina's Cocina's food!!  The service was slow (seemed like the waiter had just started), our second round of drinks (Margaritas)  took 15 minutes to get.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed in this place! Normally their food is really good but this last visit was horrible. We always bring people who visit us from out of town here bc the food is good and the ambiance is nice,but the menudo we ordered was so chewey it wasnt inedible. When we told our waiter it was undercooked he said he will let the cook know but didnt offer us a different food item and didn't even offer us a discount. Sadly we will not be going to this place anymore because of this."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Try the pork chili verde and tamales are a must! Great service....we will be back!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting much but wow was this place good. Being from southern CA I've had plenty of real Mexican food. I had a lengua torta and the lengua was very tender and melt in your mouth. The bread was fluffy and light and all the other ingredients (beans, lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole, etc) made it a simple but balanced and most importantly delicious sandwich. My dining companion had the mole de pollo and she also loved it. Pretty big portions and we were thoroughly stuffed after. Maybe we shouldn't have filled up on so much complimentary chips/salsa/refried beans. Oh yeah and that guacamole we ordered.

Service was fast and friendly. I loved the uniforms the servers wear--extra bright take on traditional Mexican clothing."}
{"text":"Having read someone else's review, commenting on that chef boyardee taste, that was not a lie. The enchilada sauce does have that taste. And yes, the animated service attempts to distract from the upsells, & priority service to larger parties, even when seated 10 minutes after a table of two. Yes, I noticed. Bad move. Serrano's still does it better. Much better. In flavor, in service with a genuine smile, in toppings( salsa bar at your beckon call). The food at casa don juan is mute. Unless of course you like spaghettios for $20."}
{"text":"Use to drive downtown but now can walk to this location! Excellent and fresh food all the time. I've never had a dish I didn't like here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must if you enjoy fresh, home made tasting food. On a recommendation we went in for breakfast. Delicious food, I had the huevos rancheros, my husband had the chicken/enchilada combo,. Tortilla lady made fresh tortillas there in front of us and they were so yummy. The other thing I appreciated was the service. The people were extremely attentive and I'm sure they are a big reason the restaurant is successful. Raul was a especially great. We actually went back the next day and had the same great meal and the same great service."}
{"text":"It was horrible I got food poisoning from the lengua. The drinks tasted like crap and the service was real slow."}
{"text":"Warning: if you order from this place on the UberEats app, you'll always have one item they forget. Then you call and they say, can you come in and pick it up? Point of Uber is to not have to leave the house when you are relaxing. Ordered 3 times here. First 2 times no sour cream when requested in the notes. 3rd time no horchatas we paid for and I even called in and asked as soon as I placed the order for extra sour cream on our quesadillas. Just a teaspoon amount was in the box. What a joke. For the price of $50 for 2 items and a dessert; you can probably get your moneys worth else where. Maybe they should discontinue being on the app if they don't care about getting the order correct."}
{"text":"First time we eat here but surely will be the last time as well. Beans and salsa have no flavor. We waited about 40 minutes to get our food. Manager was setting table next to us and heard us saying we had waited for a long time and never came over to apologize. He went inside and sent waiter to the kitchen I guess to check on our food. We ordered one of the parrilladas it was nothing like the picture on the menu it had a lot of vegetables and little amount of meat and shrimp. Hand made tortillas are dry and hard. Food not worth the price. Gave 2 stars only because of the nice waiter even though he never apologized either for the wait but he was nice. Don't sit outside as there is a constant sewage odor."}
{"text":"Update - June 2015

The last time we got our usual takeout, it was subpar and bland. I'm hoping it was just an off night but I was really disappointed when I got home and opened the carnitas platter. I was even more disappointed when I tasted it =(

I was hesitant to come here after the over-priced, bland food we got at their downtown location a few years ago. But we live right across the street from this new location and the other restaurant we had planned on going to had a 30 min wait. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and flavors once our food arrived. I breathed a sigh of relief after the first few bites because I was expecting to be disappointed and to swear this restaurant off forever. I hope they keep it up since we live so close and it's nice to have a Mexican restaurant in this area. The service was stellar. Even the busser was incredibly friendly and super prompt clearing our plates or bringing extra chips/salsa.

The only downside was that the salsa was a bit disappointing and I still think the food could have used a tad more seasoning, but overall it tasted good. We had the carnitas platter for 2. It was the perfect amount a food for 2 but we're kind of little piggies and eat a lot. 2 normal people might have some leftovers to take home. The homemade flour tortillas were so yummy and filling! I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and was super impressed with this restaurant, from the start the decor is eye catching I could not stop looking at all the accents and decorations. Really awesome, and the food did not disappoint, the guacamole we got to start was delicious and had a great flavor, no blandness whatsoever. And the food was extremely well executed, I had sopes which were homemade and very good, my friends had the mole such was a classic version of a michoacán style mole, very good, and also we had a seafood soup which my friend said had a great flavored broth. Would highly recommend this place. Also had the lavender margarita and a few micheladas, all were awesome."}
{"text":"Gabby and her staff gave my family a wonderful experience. I can't express how great my service and food was fantastic.Nate and Abraham kept everything moving smoothly with their great customer service and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Juan and Karen were great.    Delicious authentic Mexican food and great location.   Cadillac margs yum!"}
{"text":"went in to try MR. Don Juan's food and let me tell you what i experienced... So first i tell my self hey this place is new i love the classy sign  I'm gonna try this food also because a good mexican spot doesn't really exist in Summerlin. So it all began when i opened the door and saw 2 Angels at the register, one was a server one was i believe the hostess, they greeted me with happiness. Even was curious enough to ask about my day which then i explained. Then unfortunately i was in a time crunch so i couldn't dine in. So i did what any other logical person would do  and i ordered the regular burrito with carne to gauge what type of place this gonna be. Me and the two angels continued to talk while i sat patiently on the very comfortable seating area they have made for us patrons. Where then i started to notice all the amazing decor in this classy place Mr.Don Juan and im sure his beautiful family own. So i get my food i wish them a great day. I get to my car i start to look in the bag AND GUESS WHAT? CHIPS AND SALSA.!!! I didn't know i got free chips and salsa with the burrito. The Salsa was so good i ate all of it before i got home, making me wish i ordered extra salsa(get extra salsa if you go here) finally i get to my desk where i am sitting now excited to see what the burrito tasted like. Ever heard of love at first Bite? As i bit into the burrito i could no longer see straight all i saw was hearts and stars, just as you might see in a looney tunes cartoon. Burrito to say the least was a 10 it reminded me of this other amazing restaurant i enjoyed while i lived in San Francisco. It held its form perfectly and didn't get soggy and every bite was filled with deliciousness. Thank you Mr Juan or Don. I will be returning here for my birthday party as long as that awesome happy hour is still around! If you love yourself go here. I want to see this place stay in summerlin forever!"}
{"text":"Bear is the Mexican food freak in the family, and he is constantly on the lookout for great places.  Most of what we've had so far has ranged from pretty good to 'meh', so when he scoped out Casa Don Juan online, I figured that we didn't have a whole lot to lose trying a new place.  

When we arrived, I recognized it IMMEDIATELY.  We do a lot of things around that area of Summerlin, and the Lyft cars I've been taking pass by this place all the time.  But I never thought to try eating here, so it was nice to finally get the chance. 

First thing's first: it's always a good sign, when you walk into a Mexican place, and the first thing you see is an area where the tortillas are made fresh.  When I saw that was the case here, I couldn't help but smile on the way to our table. And yes, the chips and salsa we were greeted with was ALLA THAT. 

The place itself is a bright, colorful repository of art and items that display pride in Mexican heritage.  If you didn't notice any of it, the menus sporting the images of famed artist Frida Kahlo and her other half, Diego Rivera, should be a dead giveaway.

Fresh-made tortillas help elevate any dish, and it was evident from the chicken flautas I started off with, all the way to the pork chimichanga, stuffed with so much tender, juicy meat that I barely finished it! So you KNOW we ended up skipping dessert. (Maybe next time).

As far as service goes, they have it down to a science.  Our server, Jose, was assisted by several other wait staff members, but I'd have to 'guesstimate' that we waited no longer than ten minutes for any courses we had, if THAT. 

If I had any complaints, it's that the usual combo of sides - refried beans with cheese and rice - seemed as bland as it is at other restaurants we've tried.  The flavors of the entrees make up for it somewhat, but it would be nice to have the option of whole pinto or black beans. Which, to be honest, they may have - we didn't get the chance to ask.  But I will update this review with what we discover on our next visit.

Meanwhile, Bear FINALLY has found his \"Shangri-La\" for a decent plate of huevos rancheros.  And that to me says more about how good this place is than the fresh tortillas.  We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give them a try after friends recommended it. Staff were super friendly and Efrain was our lead server. Service was very good although some might think it too fast! Food was truly outstanding starting with their salsa and then onto the best Carnitas I have ever tasted. Negro Modelo on tap was a great addition to dinner. Am so glad they are in NW Vegas now."}
{"text":"La carne asada exelente el servicio , todo exelente lo recomiendo, la mejor comida de las vegas"}
{"text":"I just left Casa Don Juan. It wasn't great, and they refilled the tequila from generic bottles under the bar. Not cool."}
{"text":"Excellent service from Nancy and Lendy! We ordered the Carnitas for 2 and servings were great! Very tasty and delicious! We also met the Manager, Mirna, she was very friendly and professional! I highly recommend Casa Don Juan's for great authentic Mexican food! This restaurant has some great authentic Mexican decor! Wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"We have visited this particular location four times now and have enjoyed each visit immensely. The enchiladas are delicious as is the chimichanga. The Cadillac margarita is the very good."}
{"text":"Went here because of \"rave reviews\" from a coworker of my husband. They serve complimentary chips , salsa and bean dip but immediately try to up sell you into ordering guacamole. If you order another bowl of chips they charge you $3.50!  What is up with that?!  We recognized our waiter Jose from Dona Maria's and he told us very hush hush that he no longer works there, the whole time looking around like somebody might overhear him. As for the food... Well it was very disappointing. I ordered the chicken tamale with green sauce with a cheese enchilada and my husband ordered the pork tamale with a taco. First of all the rice was mushy and reminded me of rice that is cooked in a bag, the refried beans were bland, as for the enchilada sauce-- it was extremely void of flavor, just salty. The chicken is cooked without sauce and then has a splash of sauce added to it before being placed in an excessive amount of masa. As a tamale connoisseur and excellent tamale maker myself this was just plain blasphemy. Margaritas were very watered down.  Drank two because it was two for 1 and never got a buzz. Definitely not a do over for this place."}
{"text":"Finally!! They've brought the real Mexican Hype to Summerlin!! Wonderful!! Gracious Jesselyn! numero 1!"}
{"text":"This place is mom's favorite I always order the pork and green chili, Chiles rellenos are delicious but the best for me is the fresh chips and salsa with the best tasting bean dip I've tried! We've been going to the one on Main st. for over 10 years and now this one in summerlin to visit our favorite waiter."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, our waiter was awesome!! The atmosphere was nice, food was good and better yet, we went with a Groupon to try this restaurant out. I must remain loyal to my favorite Mexican place but my boyfriend and son liked Casa Don Juan MUCH better than our usual go to spot..."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming to this restaurant. I saw the Bistec Ranchero which I was familiar with from other restaurants so i ordered it.  Unfortunately when it came out it was not what I expected. Our server Nate was very attentive to our table and my getting something I didn't want.  The manager Jose came to the table and was also very nice and understanding. They quickly made me the Wet Burrito which was amazing! They didn't charge us for the first dish. Alex was also very attentive to our drinks. Overall great service great food great atmosphere. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service from all. Our server and bus person, Jesse and Kyle were extra attentive and friendly. We will be back often. Thank you."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the other location many time. Took some friends to the Summerlin location for dinner. The food was as good as the other location. The service lacked. Jose ( who I recognized from Dona Maria's)  just didn't seem to listen when we requested something and we had to ask for things several time. He was pushing the Gold Margaritas, so 3 of us ordered them. We should have asked the price. We definitely weren't expecting $14.00 each. Probably won't go back very often, because of the service."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my boyfriend, we love it! They have good food/drink specials and the bartenders are all great. It's a great place to watch football, soccer (whatever season it is) or just have a little fun without spending a fortune. My only complaint is that it's usually pretty cold in the bar, so it might pay off to bring a jacket. Also, try the tamales... delicious!"}
{"text":"Don Juan's west side is a nice place to go for a good Mexican traditional meal. Basic menu with free chips, salsa, and refried beans when seated. Wait staff is amiable and returns often to make certain your every need is fulfilled. The bar was packed last night and it was hump day! Well done! The atmosphere is happy and the food was basic. I like a little more adventure when dining out so I should have tried the lengua. Next time I will."}
{"text":"We checked this place out because our friends raved about it.  We will give it another try but this experience was just average.  First off everyone is very friendly which is a plus. Another plus is the chips. They weren't greasy at all but I had to add salt for my taste.  Good bean dip and salsa both complimentary.  My husband ordered a watermelon jalapeño margarita and I did the pomegranate margarita both very tasty.  My second round didn't taste nearly the same and when I sent it back the waiter came back and it looked and tasted like they just dropped pomegranate in the margarita I just sent back.  Hummmm.  I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it so like a sport I drank it.  After stuffing my face with chips I wasn't hungry so decided on a al la cart tamale cheese and jalapeño. Decent... I had hoped for more cheese and more than one jalapeño but whatever.  My husband ordered the fajitas... Big disappointment here. Fajitas are meant to be sizzling!!!!!! Nothing when they arrived to the table. The bummer part was the table next to us got theirs sizzling hot.  It presented like the food was sitting around for awhile.   The chicken was dry and shrimp was small.  Overall wasn't terrible will try it again but mainly for drinks and chips!  We may even take advantage of the free shuttle service that will take you home!  Everyone should try this place just for that!"}
{"text":"Was on vacation and ate at this place. Service was great and food was excellent!!! a little pricy but you can't go wrong for real authentic Mexican food. I will be returning on my next vacation."}
{"text":"The margaritas are amazing! Although you need to buy a pitcher as 2 scooters are the same price as the pitcher. 

The burrito and chimichangas as stuffed with meat and not rice. We've been several times and have not had a bad experience. My only issue is that they do put lard in their beans which is not disclosed. My sons allergic which didn't turn out too good but we learned and still return for some of the better Mexican food in Vegas"}
{"text":"My husband and I relocated to Las Vegas from So. Cal. and have been looking for a Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas that we like as well as the ones we left.  This was it!  The food was outstanding, although a little expensive for Mexican food.  We were served by Lozada and he couldn't do more to please us and make us feel welcomed.  The restaurant is very pretty inside - great environment.  The handmade tortillas were to die for!!  This is a must go to restaurant for good Mexican food.  Cooked perfectly with wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst manager/ owner (supposedly) Maria. She is a the rudest and most disrespectful human-being, oh and her customer service sucks!! I picked up food & the container broke completely & pierced the bag & left sauce all over my car. I called to complain & she said \"bring it back but not my fault if U drive crazy!!! \" WHAT A B$*^#?!!!! When I arrived she then said, \"not my problem!\" Gave me my money back & said I was not welcomed back!!! She blamed me- the paying customer!!! DO NOT GIVE THEM UR $$$!!!! Not worth the disrespect!!"}
{"text":"We eat there once a week - the service is really great.  The waiters and the bussers are awesome!  We never run out of anything before they are bringing refills, the food comes pretty quickly too.  Food is good, authentic Mexican food.  I think it's better than the downtown location by far.

Whoever does the hiring and training should be congratulated!"}
{"text":"When in Las Vegas visit Casa Don Juan in one of the two locations down town Las Vegas or Summerlin anything you order is great food is delicious first class service I had the pleasure of eating with the owner good attitude beautiful decor the environment is family friendly 10/10"}
{"text":"Great place great food great drinks!!!!

i get the shredded beef tacos and a michelada preparada.

We take all our friends here after a hard week of work. Thanks guys keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We have ate at the downtown location several times, and we were excited to try the summerlin.  However,  NOT good.   The waiter kept touching my granddaughters on their faces, and the food tasted like canned ingredients.   I do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent Huevos Rancheros and Carne Asada. Our servers Ramiro and Joese Lozada were prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We came here for lunch after reading the reviews and weren't disappointed. I had the carnitas plate, my partner had the carne asada plate.  We each added a tamale to our order. All good.  We even had flan for dessert...great texture, not too sweet.  The service was amazing...Juan was awesome and a lot of fun!  The owner and service staff were very visible and were very attentive to us.  The facility is great.
 I'm from Texas and we know our mexican food...this one ranks up there with the best. Total for the meal (guacamole, two entrees, add tamales, and add flan) was  just over $50 which is reasonably proced, especially given the quality and amount of food we had.  Next time we're in Las Vegas, we'll be here again!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME Service!!! Always love the food and the attention from the staff.   
They are very friendly and always give great attention from the time you walk in until you leave."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great music and absolutely Best watermelon margaritas by the bartender, Nancy!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food I have found in Las Vegas! Have been to both locations and have not been let down yet fantastic job Casa Don Juan keep it going."}
{"text":"I was going to email this directly to the manager, but I received an error message stating his mail folder was full.  Apparently I'm not the only one with this complaint.   Here is the email I had created.  

\"My wife and I have been visiting this restaurant since we moved to the area two years ago.   We have always loved our date nights.   Tonight however was an awful experience.   Our waiter ignored us the entire night.   We finished all of the chips without him coming to take our dinner orders.  I had to get up from the table and ask him politely if we could order.   After our food came, he never checked on us.   He came to check on the tables next to us several times, but not once checked on us.   Our drinks stayed empty.   I even had to grab his attention to get our bill.   As he walked away from a neighboring table is I had to ask politely for my bill.  It was a very disappointing experience. \""}
{"text":"Love this place!!! 
I was a little skeptical coming from San Diego and not having good Mexican food out here Since we have moved, but WOW I'm glad we gave this place a chance!!! 
We loooooove any sort of hispanic food and theirs is killer. They have fantastic rice and beans and they give you ships salsa and beans when you first sit down as appetizer and it's super tasty so don't fill up on it. 
Their super burrito is so good I love the green sauce it's a little spicier than the red. 
Their Steak plate is super good and they cook the steak to order and it's so soft and tender that you can cut it with a knife with a little grilled jalapeño on the side OMG so bomb! 
Their shrimp plate is bomb too I love the sauce it's in. 
Can't go wrong with anything they have! 
And get the 2 for 1 beers or one of their specialty drinks they have a full bar! 
Anyway! This place is awesome and you need to try it out!"}
{"text":"All staff members were 5 star, as well as the food. Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Outsanding food and awesome service!! Getbthe Enchiladas  with bran rice and a taco!! Homemade tortilla and chips are also Excellent!! Frozen Happy hour Marguerita 2 for 10 was very good too! Fried Ice cream is a must... The only thing I didnt like was the On the rocks margarita bad taste Bad color!!"}
{"text":"Love this place food is incredible and staff is very friendly. The bar is fun to hang out in."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times it doesn't disappoint. I had the tostadas de Camaron. My big had a chimichanga and a wet burritos and where good. My son had a burrito de carne asada only. I also had a hibiscus margarita."}
{"text":"I've said it before and I'll keep saying it...I love Mexican food.  I'm a native Texan that was raised in Las Vegas, it's practically in my blood.  That being said, again, I cannot say enough good things about this place. The food is amazing and I don't think I've ever waited more than ten minutes from ordering to get my food.  

The service is always excellent.  I've only ever had one complaint since I've been coming here and it was handled quickly and with no fuss by the staff.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My newest favorite Mexican restaurant in town! The best chicken tacos I've had and the chile relleno isn't bad either but the service is the best of any restaurant in town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food stop since I moved to Las Vegas. The food has been consistently good, and delivery has been on time or better. I like their burritos and the nachos were full of meat. The portions are large enough to have leftovers."}
{"text":"This place is great!  And the server juan was very nice and entertaining....pure quality...."}
{"text":"Great food at a very reasonable price. The staff is always helpful and friendly. I suggest you order items ala carte. It saves a little money."}
{"text":"I'm so happy. First time to this location and its cinco de mayo. Our server was awesome out bartender was too. We sat in the bar, of course there was a wait but we expected it and we didn't mind. Food was amazing and we will be back for sure! Only think would make it better is if the carne asada wasn't so finely chopped but it still tasted great! Best Mexican food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is the clone of the Downtown Casa Don Juan's, but with a little better neighborhood vibe. I love the food, not super traditional, but a cross of American Mexican and traditional Mexican. I love the tamales, cheese and Jalapeño are yummy.  

Check out the new digs on Vegas & Buffalo."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service. Staff was friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, everything that came out of the fryer was not good at all. Don't know if it was just a bad night, but chips were stale, \"crispy\" taco was soggy and greasy, and tamal was dry with too much maza. Rice and beans were very good, but nothing else was impressive. Will not go here again, especially for the price. Not really sure how this place got such a good rating. Makes me doubt the validity of their ratings."}
{"text":"This has been my first best experience at a breakfast authentic Mexican restaurant. 
Everyone is very pleasant and so attentive.
Every waiter on the floor came to our table repeatedly assuring if we were good and asked if we needed anything else. 
I LOVE THIS PLACE !!! 

Keep up all the hard work guys!!! You are doing amazing !!!! 


Prices : reasonable and non expensive"}
{"text":"Tried it twice and it was horrible both times. It is not real Mexican food or even good Americanized Mexican food. The second time we went our waiter was drunk and obnoxious. Mariana's grocery store has way better food by far!"}
{"text":"We go here regularly and it's always amazing service every time.  Quality customer service is hard to find in this city and this place always delivers it, whether it's empty or packed! The food is always delicious, and the waiters are on top of everything...they are a little bit pricey but totally worth the service and the amazing tortillas (made fresh in-house)!"}
{"text":"This place is always on point with their food and friendly service. I've been a loyal customer since the opening of the original one in downtown off Main Street. The food is very authentic Mexican, like you would find in a Mexican home. I enjoy their Chile regeno which is number #12 and their carne asada plate. Their fresh hand made tortillas and fresh salsa along with their quality of food and excellent service set this place apart."}
{"text":"Cute colorful Mexican restaurant. Friendly enthusiastic staff. Fresh tasty ceviche & enchiladas. Salsa is tangy and flavorful and the Margaritas perfect.  Mexican rice and beans seasoned perfectly as well."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in town.  I'm a monthly visitor to both locations.  I like the downtown location better, because it seems more authentic but the Summerlin location is fine and wait staff keep things lively."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Great service, the interior is cute, and the food was delicious .
We went at what seemed like a relatively busy time but we were seated right away and given complimentary salsa and bean dip with tortilla chips. The menu is pretty big so it hard to pick what we wanted because everything sounded really good. After we ordered our food came out after no longer than 15 min. It was the fastest service I can say I've ever received in a legitimate restaurant. They give you huge plates filled with amazing delicious food. 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic and delicious Mexican food"}
{"text":"Yelp Eat24 deliver order! The convenience can spoil you! I think something happens to a unicorn every time Yelp Eat24 is mentioned... It rains glitter over someone or something...

Okay so simple review cuz I know I'll want their chile relleno again. Yes their CHILE RELLENO is super flavorful. Their combos are so fulfilling. There's practically 3 meals in a combo cuz you get two of something (same or different choices), plus the beans and rice with a tortilla. The extras you can basically make a burrito with. Then there's chips. Awesome stuff! 

Oh and their chicken soup so hearty with the potatoes and veggies. Great for comfy food!

I've passed by the restaurant numerous times. I believe there's a bar and margarita specials. Inquire within.  4.5****× includes the benefit of them having Yelp's Eat24 delivery or pickup. 

Gotta love their chile rellenos though! Chile-me hot stuff!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff and excellent food as always !!! Beef enchilada is my favorite,
Vuelve a la vida cocktail with shrimp, oyster, octopus and abalone is the best! Im glad they opened this location near Summerlin because the other one is a little too far for us. 
Often they have a good deal on Groupon."}
{"text":"When you enter you are treated by good smells, bright decor, and staff dressed to the nines.  Jose is the best waiter and made us feel very comfortable. 1 chimi, one serving of fajits, and 2 enchilada (one green, one red) later we rolled out of Casa Don Juan's with our bellies full and a big smile on our faces... I would consider Casa Don Juan's the best Mexican food Restaraunt in Las Vegas... Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is way over priced and not that great. Service was over whelming the waiters hovered over our table. Made it uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is excellent!! The service was wonderful with our server Jose. He was very attentive and expressed knowledge regarding the lunch specials which is affordable. The restaurant is authentic in respect to Mexican food. I received my order in a timely manner. I'm very wowed by this whole experience. I will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Took 1hour to get my drink then 1 1/2 to to get my food then when I got my food they didn't bring my side salad my beer and my tortillas they took another 15min to do I didn't even end up eating the food DAVID was the only one trying to help me get my food kept apologies why the manager kept telling him to take care of the bigger party that had 2 waiters already and wanted him to be the 3rd waiter to the bigger party I guess my money wasn't good enough"}
{"text":"Woohoo! How did we not know about this location? My brother suggested it for lunch today and Mom and I proclaimed \"heck yes!\" We started with the usual bean dip and salsa, going through two baskets. We ordered a variety of items-Mom and brother each had enchiladas, I went with my usual order of chicken tacos, and my SIL went for the flautas. Everybody cleaned their plate and unfortunately, we didn't have any room for dessert! Juan was our server and he definitely had a big personality! We got there early for lunch, but our area filled up quickly and we still got the perfect amount of attention. Jared was bussing tables and helping Juan out and he was great as well. We definitely had awesome service. So glad to know we have a CDJ in our area. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Everything on the menu is great. The seafood is excellent. The drinks are great. We also like the original downtown location."}
{"text":"Sadly, this 1 star review is deserved. We had planned a day in advance for a large party on a Monday night. You think they would have been prepared for that. We were seated promptly but we waited an hour and 30 min for our food. When we got it, half of it was burned. Mostly the cheese quesadillas. The food was subpar. On a positive note, our servers were great and kept apologizing for the delay in getting our food to us. We were charged $14.99 for a cheese quesadilla with rice and beans. Ouch! I won't be back to Casa de Juan."}
{"text":"When we are talking about Mexican Restaurants ... there is just one - Casa Don Juan !
So friendly and sooooo Professional !!!
The Best restaurant in Nevada for sure .... but maybe the best in Mexico too !!
The food is extremely delicious , the Delivery service -  we are live on 12 miles from the restaurant and our food was delivered in 40minutes !
Amazing !!"}
{"text":"Great service, food was amazing, Jose L. Great server!  Will come back!  Price is amazing for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I think this is the first 1 star rating I've handed out. First of all, they don't offer ground beef tacos or enchiladas. But there's hamburgers on the menu. That was upsetting. When they put the plate of food in front of me, right away the smell was weird not in a good way. They put cojita cheese on the chile relleno. Never do that. Cojita is almost the same as Parmesan. No, no, no. Does not work for me. Horrible smell, horrible taste. The rice and beans were nothing special. No Mexican flavor. No lettuce or cabbage on the plate. And it was expensive. I will never let anyone else choose a restaurant for me."}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan is the best! Jose Hernandez is Number one! Most of the time when we come into the restaurant Jose Hernandez waits on us. Jose always makes us feel special and like family. He is always professional, polite, and makes sure we are happy with everything! Jose is an asset to the company. We always want to keep coming back to this restaurant! Exceptional decor too! I wish everyone was like Jose Hernandez! Thanks for being here in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food is so on point ! Have had chile rojo and chile verde last few times  omg the best in town ask for Juan he is the best  waiter in las vegas most fun best service just  outstanding as it gets will be back asap"}
{"text":"Yep... the bomb..... same great food... found the new location.....victor was our waiter... he was excellent... best Mexican food up here in the north!!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Ordered the #35 and my husband got his usual pork nachos. The food is great! The servings tho are much smaller than the Don Juan restaurant downtown on Main Street. The customers are completely different. They cater more to the white retired/upper class people. Which is okay, it's just different vibe than original location. I'd rather drive the extra mile to downtown restaurant for serving sizes and the diversity of customers. Plus the waiters at summerlin location check on you every 10 minutes, but it feels as if it's every 5. Where as the other location doesn't check on you rarely at all. So that's a thumbs up to summerlin. Restaurant decor in summerlin is decorated to make upper class family feel more comfortable. Main St location is all Frida out and very authentic feel to it."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food!! The people that work there are so nice, our server was very patient and outstanding!"}
{"text":"I enjoy every time I go? I like their music and clean place as well nice services nice food"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of attending a birthday brunch at this festive Mexican Restaurant.
The staff, the decor, the service and the food were all exceptional.
It deserves consideration if you're planning a special occasion. 

If possible ask for Juan, he'll most definitely get the party started."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Mexican food with a tortilla lady making fresh tortillas you got a love that. Service was excellent and the food and drinks were tasty I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've only had this restaurant deliver and the whole family loves it! The quality of the food was superb, the service was fantastic, and the wait was well within what I'd expect for the quality. My husband recommends the Chilaquiles con Steak."}
{"text":"Went in on opening day, place was awsome! The wait staff was great, food was one of the best Mexican foods I have had, and the owner Maria even came to the table to thank us for our business! Prices are up there, but the quailty of food is also, so I have no problem with them. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Second chance failed. We went when first open as we like downtown location. It was awful. Decided to give 2nd chance.  Nice staff..nice atmosphere but food sucked.  Fajitas were not even served on hot platter..vegs were barely cooked.  Enchilada cheese was cold and hard abd had funky taste to it. That was enough. .won't be going back."}
{"text":"I like that atmosphere here, and the waiters are great.  I've been here l like 5x or so.  This time with my young girls for the appetizer platter for 2 and some drinks.  Everything was good and the girls loved it as well. A little bit of this and that was perfect for us 3, we even took leftovers home so it was alot for us.  No complaints here, I would recommend this place.  Sorry no pics we were to hungry lol"}
{"text":"Always loved the Main Street location. Was very excited about the Summerlin location! Wonderful atmosphere and great good."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with a girlfriend and the customer service and food were both equally great. We were greeted and sat right away. 

Our server was friendly, funny and made sure our chip bowls and water glasses were full. 

I ordered a combination plate with a chicken taco and cheese enchilada and both were really tasty. The taco had a large amount of shredded chicken in a crispy shell. Both of the tortillas were fresh as we could see a woman making them behind a glass window inside the restaurant.

My friend ordered the chicken fajitas and a huge portion was served on a sizzling plate. Equal portions of chicken and tons of veggies along side guacamole, salsa, beans, rice and fresh warm tortillas.

We were able to enjoy chatting and eating without feeling rushed or concerned that our food was taking too long as it came out fast!"}
{"text":"Moved here a few months ago being new resident's to Nevada....the boyfriend and I was looking for authentic Mexican food since we are from Cali....we read the reviews to check it out.....well the reviews lived to our expectations....this place is so awesome.....the expectations were totally met! The beans, the rice... home made tortillas made in front of you through an open window...the whole frida poncho villa decor.....I loved this place.....took some family out tonight that came to visit us here in vegas since we recommended it...they truly loved it! Try it you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"This is a real find in the Las Vegas neighborhood general area of Summerlin. Food is fresh, tasty, and well-prepared. The staff treats you well, like a special guest. They seem to do anything well. The photos of Frida Kahlo are a nice touch and serve as an interesting conversation piece. Portions are good."}
{"text":"Been there twice in 2 weeks . Food is very good and priced right. Drinks were a little over priced but tastey. Disappointed they did not except my Groupon at this location as there were no restrictions as far as I could see. Will be going back for sure ."}
{"text":"Seriously I would say if I could give this place no stars I would, but I guess the bus boys deserve a star. We had horrible customer service!! Our waiter was beyond rude! When ordering our food he was questioning us with attitude like we weren't reading the same menu. And talking to us like we were stupid. Then when we politely asked the bus boy who brought us our chips and salsa (which we liked him) for a new waiter we were asked if we were serious. Excuse me? If we weren't serious we wouldn't have asked. We honestly were shocked in how we were being treated! We were kind of laughing at how the experience was going, but being optimistic that hopefully the food would make up for it. That was laughable! The enchilada sauce tasted like spaghettios! The ceviche had no taste to it!! Drowning it in lime didn't help. We're not from here, just here visiting. But this place would never be considered again when we return. So much for trying to make your customers happy!! Lol. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"I went to Dinner at Casa Don Juan and I met Billy. His service was outstanding and the food was delicious.  I ordered the Carnitas plate and chiles toreados.  Will definitely be coming back! Keep up the Great work Billy!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with friends ... food was great and service was as good ... like that they provide bean dip with their chips ... food is plenty"}
{"text":"We came to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday. We had such an amazing waiter José Hernandez. He has amazing customer service skills. Kept our drinks filled and our food was delicious. He is a top notch waiter. We'll be back again to see ya. Thank you"}
{"text":"Stay away bartender too busy on her cellphone too busy taking care of personal business to be hospitable had to ask for everything not one thing she did or said made us feel welcome food was not hot needed salsa she brought me the same thing as for the chips asked for hot salsa I know they have it I've had it before won't be back we will tell our friends"}
{"text":"cold soggy food,very small portions. I would not recommend waisting your money. rud hostesses."}
{"text":"LOVED it!!!! The service was fantastic the food was delicious the atmosphere was great very clean. 
They seemed happy to help us, sometimes you go places and you feel unwelcome but this was not the case. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Finally opened.  We tried the one on Main Street about a month ago because this one wasn't open yet.  The food was good and the service was better.  They definitely brought the same standards to the new restaurant.  So glad it's close to home.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is consistent. Great menu options and amazing staff members that made it memorable. Thanks to our waiter Juan who entertained us!"}
{"text":"Great food great service
Our server was Juan top notch
No bull best flour tortillas ever
Huevos rancheros were perfect 
Been dip on point salsa is very good
Check it out if your in the area"}
{"text":"Great place... highly recommend...great original Mexican comfort food.
I usually sit in the bar area. The 2 beers for $6 is a great deal. 
My favorite plate is the giant chimichanga with diablo sauce!
Friendly staff and fresh atmosphere."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS every time is all I can say! The staff is always pleasant and professional."}
{"text":"It really hurts me to write this review, because I used to really really enjoy coming here all the time. I would come here at least once a week and I would bring my family or come by myself. The service was great, especially Juan, and I would always take care of my waiters and leave a nice tip. The food was one of the best in town!! Unfortunately, the last few times I've come here the service was BAD, it took forever for them to even acknowledge I was there. Then last night,  I tried sitting at the bar, and the girl behind the bar was not nice or friendly at all. When I had to ask for chips, salsa, to make an order she just had an attitude. I tried to address the manager/owner lady when walking out, asking her about Juan and trying to tell her how bad the girl was behind the bar, but she just kept ignoring me and pretty much just said, \"goodbye.\" 

This is why I decided to leave an honest review because I used to truly enjoy coming here, but not anymore. If I were the owner/manager I would want to know if any of my employees were not being friendly or not providing excellent service. When Juan was there he would go above and beyond to welcome me with open arms. He knew what I used to always order. I noticed Juan was like this with all the customers that came in. Since I haven't seen him there, the service has dropped tremendously. One more thing I noticed was the chicken tacos I used to get had so much more chicken, then they do now. I really hope they make some changes in a positive direction, so i can come back and enjoy this place with my friends and family again. I know I'm not the only one that has been experiencing this poor service either. I used to talk about this place to all my friends and family and they all have agreed that the service is not the same anymore."}
{"text":"It is with heavy heart that I write my first not so good review:( 

I pondered writing this review for a while for several reasons. First of all, I swore to myself that I would only write 5 star reviews because I don't really like saying negative things about a place. I'm motivated by positive experiences not negative ones. Secondly, I didn't want the review to be clouded by my negative feelings that were initially present, as I was still shocked by the service and the bill days later! Finally, I debated on the number of stars to give since I've never written a review with less than 5. I'm an all or nothing type person so my initial thought was to give it 1 star but decided that it would be wrong to do that since I was able to eat the food and finish my drink. 

Just before posting this, I asked my daughter her opinion and she said 2 stars. She wanted to walk out after 10 minutes but she is kinda agro. She thought I was being generous by giving it 3 stars so let's just say it was 2-1/2 stars! 

I also hate writing really long reviews because I start to bore myself! However, this review probably needs to be long because there is so much to talk about. Ok here I go! 

So my daughter had just moved to Vegas,  and had been asking the locals if they knew of a good Mexican restaurant. Everyone told her Lindo Michoacan or Casa Don Juan. So when I came to visit, we decided to come here as it was close to where she lives. 

Ok I'm already bored so I'll just get to the point! Bad service, mediocre food, weak drinks, and high prices!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, good service and good food, but pricey.  $1 beers during football games, but they came in a small plastic glass and the waiter did not tell us about the 2 for $5 special.  I think we will try another restaurant the next time we are seeking mexican"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the salsa had me at hello! My mom and I shared the #3 as we have both cant eat very much. The enchiladas were very good and tasty, the taco was fantastic but I wish the taco shell was more crunchy.  Over all the location and food were perfect.  I will be back again"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is great and the staff is so wonderful. The lunch specials are also really affordable which is a plus."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for lunch!  Have been driving past this place for a while now thinking they must be doing something right since this is location #2.  It was awesome!!  Chips salsa bean dip and water came out right away YUM!!  We started with watermelon jalapeño margaritas...WOW!!  The perfect blend of ingredients . I have tried finding good tamales here in Las Vegas but gave up years ago . The tamales here were crazy good!!!  The green sauce had a great kick to it!!  My friend had the chile rellano.  I've never felt the desire to try one but she shared with me...I've been missing out!!  Service by Juan was perfect...he had 5 tables to attend to but we never had to wait for anything!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Always fast and friendly.  Carnitas is amazing and chicken is some of the best I have had. Great servers!!!!  Great prices!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good and service is great but it seems overpriced for what you get. I mean they even charge for hot salsa... only the regular chips and salsa are included with the meal. Four meals no appetizers, no alcohol, and no dessert came to over $100."}
{"text":"Recently attended a business mixer at Casa Don Juan Summerlin and had a great experience.  The food, drinks and service were all excellent.  Looking forward to coming here more often!"}
{"text":"On a job nearby so decided to try this place. I order two  shredded beef taco lunch specials and two 32 oz ice teas. $8.99 each. I'm informed no soup and salad as I'm a to go order. Total $27.00. I drive across the street to my job and find the all the food is cold and the tacos are extremely greasy. Terribly disappointed and no time to return for a refund. Never again."}
{"text":"The BEST Mexican restaurant in town! Friendly staff and excellent quality food comparable to some of my favorites in L.A. A family favorite. The best homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"My new neighborhood favorite. Very cute decor and the aroma of fresh made tortillas when you walk in! They offer a wide selection of diverse margaritas like watermelon jalapeño -yes that's right watermelon jalapeño -both refreshing and spicy!  For those who like seafood the \"vuelve a la vida\" seafood cocktail is great. The fresh tortillas are delicious and the chips are served with warm retried beans and salsa. Looking forward to going back and saving room for their homemade desserts!"}
{"text":"Jose was our waiter too.  He was as professional a waiter as any 5 star restaurant, and the food was very good.  I had the Chile Relleno, and it was pretty good.  My wife had the Steak and Shrimp Fajitas.  The Fajitas were the best I have ever found, my wife won the best meal contest.  4 stars due to Chile Relleno being pretty good.  We will be regulars there."}
{"text":"We came in for Mother's Day. We had reservations for 7 p.m. and there was a line waiting outside to get in. They brought in immediately, This Server came in right after and brought us the salsa with chips and guacamole immediately as well. He took our order and it was unbelievable the speed in which the food came out. The chef in the back must be psychic knowing what we were going to order in advance. The food was fresh it was delicious. They totally have it together in this restaurant. Best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to and we eat out a lot.  I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Beautiful place and beautiful people. Got wonderful service and great food. Boom Shaka laka.!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  I was here for lunch with my boyfriend and son, had a wonderful experience our waiter Juan was a lot of fun and lively! We had the mojarra frita and a wet burrito the green sauce was so delicious and the fish was exceptional. They even gave my son a free noodle soup which he devoured not to mention the homemade chips and salsa. I'll definitely be back and soon"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food. Good quality, authentic dishes, good service, friendly people. Clean facilities. Free shuttle home if you drink, all of these - 5 stars. 

One start less the moment you read your bill and there is a $2.99 charge for the habanero sauce I requested. 

I've eaten here half dozen times. The salsa is \"mild\" and acceptable. I understand the demographic placement of this restaurant so that's fine. Asked the waiter for something a little hotter... And boy did that burn on the way out - no pun intended. :-) 

Spent $118 on 3 adults and 2 children. Shouldn't a salsa be complimentary on a $20 dish? It's not the 3 bucks- it's the principle. 

Paid the bill anyway and refused to have the charge removed- that wasn't the point (but they missed that). The manager on staff schooled me on the need to charge for sauce. I don't feel I needed lessons on salsa. I have eaten at many Mexican cuisine restaurants. I am native Mexican. Never once have I paid $3 for 1oz of salsa."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. Ambiance, food, decor, service, everything.

The food is unbelievably fresh and the service is the best in the city.

We are always treated like royalty and have always gotten consistently greeted with a smile.

Love this place and we think it's one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Difficult for me to be a fan here.  I like the downtown location a lot better just because of their staff.  But both these places are pricey and for my fajita, somehow I ended up with only 3 flour tortillas even though I ordered corn.  

On the menu they have a picture of this shrimp thing wrapped in bacon but they don't sell it as an entrée or appetizer.  What the hell?

If you can navigate through the confusing menu, come try this place out."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. They ran out of rice and substituted it with French fries instead. It took over 40 minutes to get our food, which wasn't even worth the wait. We were ignored the entire time we were eating. The prices were high compared to the quality of the food. No apologies were given after it was clearly stated that my party wasn't happy with our visit. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've got to say, I was hesitant on trying the shrimp quesadilla. Unfortunately I didn't dine in but called it in for pick up. The lady greeted me nicely and took my order quickly/accurately. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very lively so 5/5. The food was a 5/5. The shrimp and tomatoes inside the quesadilla gave it a lot of flavor. Will be coming here again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of the original Casa Don Juan back in the day.  The menu is extensive and can get a bit overwhelming.  But trust me, everything starts to taste the same at Casa Don Juan.  I'm not usually here by choice.  When I'm here, it's probably because one of my co-workers wanted to come here and I was out voted.  I should investigate the voting, but I'll just let it go. I'll play it safe and get their fajitas. A big plate with very little substance is what you get at Casa Don Juan.  Only about 25% of the plate is the meat.  The rest is the cheap stuff like the rice and the beans.  The tortilla chips they give you is very inconsistent. Some days, they're perfect, fresh, and airy.  Other days, they're hard, greasy, and salty.  Price for a meal here isn't the best considering what you actually get.  If there's a shining moment to Casa Don Juan, then it's the service.  The servers here are marvelous. Overall, the food is just okay. I've had better.

2017 Yelp Review #82"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant near my house. Love their salsa and everything else we have tried has been  fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Although a little pricey, the food here is sooo good! It was flavorful and fresh. Our server was nice and made sure we had what we needed. The portions aren't huge for the price paid though. It was enough food to fill me up, but may not be for others."}
{"text":"Usually I like this place but today I guess no, we order carnitas and they not provide salsa only pico de gallo, so they try to charge $3 for a spicy salsa, it include only fry jalapeños but cold ones, for the milanesa not chiles or salsa, the aguas like horchata don't have a refill like in the restaurant Michoacan, just for so little they lost a customer.

Mexican restaurants don't charge for the salsa even the spicy one, and I'm talking even in Las Vegas Blvd don't charge for it."}
{"text":"Love this place very polite clean and plenty of food serve in your plate homemade tortillas"}
{"text":"Raul runs a good ship. We were customers on Main st, now he is close to our home with his Second Restaurant. I had my favorite this morning. Chorizo con Huevos while I enjoyed my newspaper on the large Patio.
This is my spot for Mexican food and great service."}
{"text":"My second visit was the telling sign of when the place is busy versus the time in between lunch and dinner when I came the first time.

The place was packed but they have a lot of seats so they found us a table immediately. 

The wait staff was again very friendly and prompt. However, the waiter did misinform my son on what was in his dish so when it arrived, we had to send it back (the waiter was very apologetic). 

I liked my chili relleno and beef taco combo the first time, so ordered it again. This time, the taco fell apart as it was served on a bed of grease, so I didn't enjoy that part but the relleno was tasty. My wife had the vegetarian burrito which was \"pretty good\" to her.  

We also ordered queso dip with jalapeños- I'm not a big queso fan one way or another but my wife likes it and thought it was tasty. 

Finally, I don't know what it is about ambient noise in this place but they had someone playing with the music and I guess someone on staff wanted it loud while another wanted it quieter and there was a war about it as it kept going up and down on the same song for like five minutes til the loud person won!

Overall, I think the food is good and will chalk up the other stuff to the place bring new and finding their groove. I'm not so sure if this place is as good as I thought it was after the first visit, but I think it has potential"}
{"text":"We ordered here for the first time. I will say the food was good. However, we ordered a side of queso and chips and what we got was not what we were expecting. The chips- tasty. Queso - shredded cheese in a box : / Now, two things; one every restaurant I have ever been to (between WA and TX) queso has been melted cheese dip. Two, I understand that the word means cheese. But since there are little to no descriptions on the food items, I went with what precious experience lead me to believe. In addition to this little dilemma, they didn't deliver our large coke. So after ordering $63 of food and not getting the queso (that I was expecting) and our coke, I called to let them know. This is where things got worse. The female who answered the phone was rude. There was no apology, just \"queso at our restaurant is shredded cheese and we refunded your money for the coke\". Needless to say, as good as the good was it wasn't good enough to make up for lack of customer service. There are PLENTY of Mexican restaurants in Vegas just as good and better."}
{"text":"I visited this place a long time ago at their downtown location and loved it.  Their carne asada is very tasty.  The salsa and pico de gallo was flavorful.  The staff was friendly and very fast and efficient.  They refilled our drinks promptly never even having ask for a refill.  I liked the decorations and the ambiance and our bill was very reasonable for a nice Mexican dinner and by the way the portions were huge!  We will be frequenting this restaurant often!!!"}
{"text":"So glad they are in the west. Been to the one on main street and loved it. We went to the one in summerlin. No disappointment. Very good service and awesome food. Will most defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Didn't like the fact that they don't serve soup before the food, or even salad, if you want an horchata to drink they don't have refills wtf is that? Then if you want an extra hot sauce you get charged for that. Wet burrito was good though! Not coming here again sorry but BONITO MICHOACAN IS WAY BETTER"}
{"text":"Our son is home on leave from the Army. We asked him what he wanted for dinner and he stated \"Mexican Food and the only place I want to have is Casa Don Juan!\" At the restaurant, we had the best service from Abraham and Nate! Our drinks were never empty and no matter how busy they were, Nate and Abraham always touched base with our table. They made our family dinner a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Honestly the best service we have ever had at a restaurant. The entire staff was so friendly and attentive. Our food came fast and was delicious. This is real, authentic Mexican food! We got tacos el pastor and sopes, both dishes were very good. Highly recommend! Thank you for such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Cinco De Mayo with friends.  Service was good,  but that was the only good thing.  The food was fair to poor in flavor and taste.  The prices very high $20 per person,  no drinks or desert, and that's for a basic plate (taco,  rice and beans)."}
{"text":"Always fresh, delightful ambiance and first class service. Just had lunch on Easter Sunday and though the restaurant was busy, they always give you attentive service and they might have the finest guacamole on earth. There is a separate bar and authentic Mexican music is always playing, which adds to the atmosphere. This is at least our 20th visit... and it's always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Dis place is awesome good food good service good location  WESTSIDE summerlin all day"}
{"text":"After a long weekend of softball we needed one last meal before we hit the road.  Casa Don Juan did not disappoint.  Best nachos ever followed by the best fried ice cream.....not to mention great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very awful service . Waited almost an hour and on top of that I got food poisoning. I called them and they Didn't even care one bit. I lost a dat of work because the vomiting, the stomachache, the loss of appetite, and the diarrhea didn't stop for at least 12 hours. Don't order the steak or the fish because you might end up like me in bed all night n day . So be very careful and if you notice a stomachache then you know what is next."}
{"text":"We love it here. When we walked up they open the door for us and seated us right away..  We ordered shrimp and chicken fajitas and Cadillac margaritas.  Everything was absolutely wonderful. Our server Jose was awesome."}
{"text":"We like it here great atmosphere and food. I've went to the Main Street location for year so happy to have this location closer to home."}
{"text":"We just went to this place thinking of having a plate of menudo, we sat ordered coffee to the busser and waited for the server to order the menudo. He took the order and left, five minutes later the server came back just to tell us that they don't make menudo on Fridays apologies accepted on our part. The only downside is that when the server went to the manager in charge he explained the situation and the manager decided to charge us the coffees anyway. And I don't mind paying for what I have but that made me think that they don't appreciate the costumers. They don't care if we come back or not. The manager prefers to have the $9 on hand instead of our business."}
{"text":"Great staff and service. Had a issue on my bill and they took care of it super fast. Food was great and it hit the spot. I will look to coming back here again."}
{"text":"Thank goodness I purchased a Groupon, because this place is not worth the prices listed. I get it, you're in Summerlin and I've heard the prices are just as high at their Downtown location... but for the quality of the food, they should be lower.

Restaurants sometimes have the enormous 10 page menus, and Casa in fact does. It's a little too much with the stories and photos. If I wanted to read a book, I would go to the library. Unfortunately I was hungry. We walked in and were seated in a 2 seater mini table close to the Frida wall. My son knows about art, and knows Frida, as well as Diego Rivera, so this was pretty cool. We got to look at the prints whilst waiting for the server. I took a look at the 30 page menus and tried to decide what to order. The menu is Bilingual, and I speak and read Spanish, but for some it may be tedious. Some descriptions about the food is not on there so you either have to Google it or ask. 

It seems like the server for our section was the server for 2 others as well. The others seated after were asked for their drink order before we were, and it's probably because of the order of the tables... but still... we were waiting at least 5 minutes more than they were. Either way, we got our order in. 

I decided on the fajitas that included shrimp, chicken, and steak. My son went with a burger (basically because I make him the other items on a daily basis) we were given chips, bean dip, and salsa. My son was starving so he attacked the salsa and said it was good. The chips were pretty tasty as well. Our food eventually came out and my one request was that I did not want peppers in the fajita mixture, also, the same couple who was served their drinks first, also got their food before we did.

ANYWAY! Our food came out and the server left. I looked at my sons and it looked like your typical burger, the taste was good, and it wasn't cold so that's a plus. The fries included were thinner fries and were delicious as well... Now.. my food. Being that I ordered fajitas sans peppers I was ok with onions. I looked and there was about 4 pounds of onions. Now I like onions, just not the amount that was included... it was more like meat with my onions. Not only that, but they were caramelized to death, which was pretty disgusting after the 4th bite. The lettuce included was also brown and wilted. The steak, was cooked to death, it was also caramelized, the shrimp, the few that was included was were also on the tough side, and the few pieces of chicken I got were ok. 

The total was around $30ish, and we only ordered waters. I was going to go for desert, but, the plethora of onions killed my stomach and appetite.  I would've said something, but, our server was always running around and not in our area. I ended up with HELLA left overs, unfortunately when you try to cook food that is overcooked, the outcome is bad.

Meh."}
{"text":"Traveling through Las Vegas and needed good delivery Mexican food. Well, Don Juan's fit the bill. Had a beef tamale, cheese enchilada and two beef tacos. It was outstanding! Delivery was on time and the food was exceptional. Thanks to Yelp and all the great reviews that made me select this."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place.  My puerco chile verde was pretty good with the pork nice and tender but a bit too salty.  GF's shrimp were horrid; they were cooked beyond recognition until they had shriveled up in the shells.  The weird flavored margaritas were good but expensive.  Service was slow and spotty, had to ask twice to get silverware and water; took way too long to get served and then longer to get check.

4 stars for the chile verde, 1 star for the shrimp,  3 for the margaritas, 2 for the service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The salsa is great, the coconut margaritas are quite tasty and the waiter Jonathan is out of this world amazing! Jonathan is attentive, entertaining, and one of the best waiters we have had in a long time. He is an asset to Casa Don Juan!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the one downtown. I think this one still needs a little work. We went in here for my mother's 60th birthday party. I know we had a fairly large party  so we had two waiters. These two waiters did not seem to communicate with each other. They would be constantly in the room, asking the same questions. There were several times that the drinks for certain people were not brought. When I asked for them to celebrate my mothers birthday, they asked me if she drank alcohol. I told them that she does not, but they still brought a shot of Tequila to her anyway. The buffalo location is average, but downtown I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Craving for some Mexican cuisine on this side of town.  We decided to use the Eat 24 app and was surprised that they deliver. Order the 4 Chicken Enchilada plate with lettuce sour cream and green and red salsa mix together. Wet Burrito Asada for the meat very big portion and Very satisfying.  The green salsa has a good kick to it.  They do charge $2.99 for delivery but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and margaritas any day !  Casa Don Juan is the best Mexican restaurant in summerlin. Be careful though the margarita are strong!"}
{"text":"Amazing place make sure you get Juan as your server! Awesome guy great personality and gives amazing service! Definitely a place to go out of your way for!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Authentic. This is becoming one of our go-to places. We bring everyone here. The food is excellent every single time. Drinks at the bar are delicious! Tasty salsa and bean dip come with the chips."}
{"text":"Ok so this is my fourth time here and I feel bad for just now updating the review.  First and foremost our sever Juan is amazing! Not only fast, precise, and funny  he is full of energy and genuinely seems to loves his customers. The food is superb! The honey loves the fajitas and I LOVE the chicken tacos ala carte. If you haven't been here yet; you need to get here. Great great time!!"}
{"text":"Super wet burrito is really good and so is their chimichanga. You get sooo much food I can never finish it. So I get to have another meal. They are very friendly here and love their costumes."}
{"text":"Good service, so-so food, worst strawberry margarita ever.  Wont be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant & food was decent but, I thought the prices were a little too high. 

My friend got a michelada and it wasn't the greatest.  The guacamole wasn't made in front of you, didn't have tomatoes  and too much onion but, it was decent. I ordered the sopes and they were good."}
{"text":"First impressions say a lot, we were greeted with huge smiles and a gentleman opening the door. The manager sat us and was very polite. 

The salsa was meh, not much flavor and it isn't very chunky. We did like that the beans came with the chips. They don't offer any other salsa for free, I wish they had a salsa sampler. The green salsa or red salsa which are other options were $1.99 the habenero salsa was good in flavor and had a little more kick at to it, 4 chips in a row and you will for sure feel the heat. $2.99.  

My husband had the steak burrito wet and felt that the Asada was amazing. I had the chicken chimichanga the special portion and it was absolutely delicious, one of the best I have ever had. The chimichanga when ordered at most places can come to greasy or lacks in quality meat and cheese. This was top notch. 

Beans are important! These beans taste homemade. A  rare find in this Las Vegas version of Mexican food. 

The waiter was great, he let us know about their happy hour which we took advantage of. Here is the deal, the happy hour will be running about 3 months while they are first open and runs from open until close! 2 for 1 margaritas, beers at the right price. $2.50 to start. After we had our food and margaritas, the manager came by to make sure we were taking advantage of the happy hour as well! That is great customer service. 
I am actually not a fan of rice and beans however; theirs were on point. Real, authentic and tasty. 

Margaritas were good as well, I  prefer a little more taste of tequila to mine but at least they weren't filled with too much sweet and sour. 

We were continuously checked on by both the manager and the server. Which was refreshing. 

The music was low which I normally prefer but this time around I wish there was a live band to shut the woman sitting next to us up. She was on the phone ignoring her lunch date and being loud. Talking bad about other people. Everything else was amazing. People need to have more respect for others. 

The only downside other than miss chatty Cathy was that we finished our meal and margaritas before getting the check. I prefer to have the bill by the time I finish my food. 

Must go! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. These guys offer cheese dip and guacamole right off the bat, but in a tone that it's complimentary. They're so \"friendly\" you almost don't think twice to ask if it's complimentary or if you're ordering an appetizer.

Next up, they offer meat or seafood substitutions that aren't listed on the menu. For example, my dinner plate came with a taco, the waiter offered fish or shrimp as a substitution but FAILED to mention there was an additional charge to choose fish or shrimp. 

This is not the only scam type move they do, they offer to get you more salsa and refried beans, again in that \"friendly\" tone, BUT if you pay attention to the menu, in SMALL print, it says refills for salsa and beans costs $4. They FAIL to inform their customers of such a charge.

It's not so much that we paid (were scammed) a few extra dollars, but it's more of the principle and genuine service factors. 

Be up front, be straight, be honest. 

Food is mediocre, nothing great and it's overpriced.

Very very bland experience."}
{"text":"Chips, Salsa and Beans are great! Service is great! Need to try more things! Not a fan of the red enchilada sauce. I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"This has been my first experience where all the employees are making sure you're doing good and constantly keep checking up on you. The food is freshly made and very good. Great time."}
{"text":"A group of friends meet up at this place.  I was minutes late so when I arrived,  everyone was already seated and had already ordered their food.  The lady at the front did not even acknowledge me.  I complimented her flowery headband and told her that I was meeting some friends. She just pointed and said that they were sitting at the back.  So I proceeded towards where my friends we sitting.  The restaurant was okay.  It was large enough, but the seating area were just too close together.  David, the waiter was really nice.  He's the reason I gave this place a 1-star, otherwise, I would have given it 0.  He immediately took my order.  My \"limonada\" took awhile before I got it.  I was parched so I sipped that drink like there's no tomorrow.  Ii didn't get asked for a refill.  I only ordered 3 tacos, and it took forever to get to me.  Everyone at the table were done with their food at this time.  I was snacking on the chips, which by the way tasted really stale.  The busboy took the salsa I was dipping the chips in and when I told him I was still using it, he tried to put it back on our table, ahem, I don't think so.  His thumb was inside the bowl touching the salsa.  No way, Jose.  I asked if I can get a fresh bowl of salsa and lime.  He said that he will get it for me.  Still waiting for my tacos.  Still waiting for the salsa and lime.  Hmmm.  They must have forgotten me.  David handed me my bill and I haven't even received my food yet.  LOL!!!  45 freakin' minutes later, I finally get my tacos.  Still no salsa and lime.  I had to ask  again if they can bring me a fresh bowl of salsa and lime.  Nothing extraordinary about the tacos.  Tough meat, guac, small diced tomatoes and a few leaves of cilantro in a soft taco shell.  I only ate one and picked the other two.  3 tacos and a medium size drink....$16.  WTH!!!! I could have treated all my friends with that at Taco Bell.  Lol.  And as we were handed the bill, David informs us that tip was not included in the bill.  He said that normally the tip in included but they forgot to add it.  OMG!!! 
Overall, I will not be coming back.  There's a lot of Mexican restaurants in town that I can truly say is very authentic and delish and this place is definitely not one that I will come to again.  Try it for yourself.  Things could be better for you.  This is just my opinion"}
{"text":"Food is ok, way overpriced. Go to the location on Main, this is not worth your time or money"}
{"text":"I've passed by Casa Don Juan Summerlin a bunch of times, but just got to try it on for size tonight.  And it fit!!

There was no wait - we eat late, and were led to a very small booth right away.  If we had stayed there, the food would have had to sit on our laps.  But it was no problem to change to a table so that the food and my purse could be comfortable.

Our waiter, José B., was excellent.  He brought Herb a taste of the draft Modelo Especial, and before we ordered he brought him some of the mole sauce to taste, too, so he could see if it was too sweet, as it often is at other places.

We enjoyed the bean dip and salsa that came with the complimentary chips.  The dip was warm and the salsa just spicy enough.  The chips weren't the best I've ever had, but they were fine, and unsalted, the way I like them.

I had a decently priced glass of wine with a fairly generous pour, and Herb's $2.50 Modelo was a bargain.

I ordered the fajitas and was able to combine chicken and shrimp for $14.95.  I don't quite get why some of my fellow Yelpers find the prices outrageous here.  There aren't many Mexican restaurants that sell fajitas at this price, and they always charge more for shrimp. (There is a $2 upcharge for choosing the steak and shrimp combo).  Moreover, the amount of meat, especially the shrimp, was enormous.  It came with frijoles, rice and guacamole.  As usual, I forgot to ask for regular beans rather than refried.  I had expected just a thimbleful of guac, but the portion didn't seem that much smaller than the one ordered as an appetizer by some nearby tables.  In contrast to some other reviews, the fajitas arrived sizzling, the onions weren't overly caramelized or disproportionately overabundant, and the lettuce was fresh, too. I took home half of my dish, along with all the tortillas, rice and beans that I couldn't finish.

My husband's mole, so often thick and gloppy, was a much lighter version here, and red, rather than dark brown.  It's definitely not as rich, but that's a good thing.  There are many different kinds of mole, since each region in Mexico claims a different recipe as its own, and it was nice to see that it wasn't a copycat of every other place in town.

We sat in the Frida Kahló room, truly a shrine to that artist, but really, the whole place is a feast for the eyes.  Authentic Mexican decorations abound, and it made me yearn for the days when I'd visit that country sometimes twice a year after my three summers in school in Guadalajara.  I asked a busboy if I could steal one of the big Mexican people sculptures lined up on a pony wall; he said he wouldn't tell, but the camera trained on them would record it.  Oh, well, my purse wasn't big enough, and besides, they were bolted down.  I checked.  :)

We really enjoyed Casa Don Juan and look forward to returning.  My only complaint was that José couldn't tell me how to say \"draft [beer] in Spanish!"}
{"text":"I love this place amazing service very friendly, quick food great drinks.Food was great after I ordered a churro as my desert and it was cold and very hard I asked the waiter to please exchange it with something else. They kindly exchanged it and they still brought me fresh made churros so delicious! The waiter, chef and owner personally apologized. Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"I was really not sure to give a 3 or a 4 star for this location. I will say it is definitely better than the downtown one.
Chips, salsa, and beans are always great! Served as soon as you sit down, and delicious!
Food is 3 star, it is good Mexican food, but nothing really spectacular or out of the ordinary. Still, it is good quality, quantity, and comes out quickly (which means to me, everything is precooked in the back)
I gave it the 4 stars because to me they shine on the cocktails and service. Never had a bad drink and never had bad service."}
{"text":"Omg !!! First the young lady at the front was lovely and beautiful look ! Second I was sorted and greeted by this guy who just all around awesome! He was funny and all smiles! Chips n salsa and Beans were to die for.... Then my Favorite part was THE TORTILLA LADY HOMEMADE OMG IT WAS OVER. GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE WAS INCREDIBLE"}
{"text":"Great service! Kept pur drinks full and always checked on us. I highly recommend the margaritas, very delish. Only complaint is my husband's tamales inside consisted of fat instead of meat."}
{"text":"The restaurant is much bigger than it looks from the outside. 
The service is very attentive... There is a lot of staff available. 

My friends and I ordered our food and an appetizer. The appetizer never came out, but the food was very good. 

They have good chips and salsa... My favorite thing to order at most restaurants and bars... theirs is very good. 

Pricing is competitive and inline with what you would expect to pay. Thankfully, it wasn't very fancy... It was traditional Mexican that most would expect. 

Will definitely go back... check them out!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday- we decided to celebrate Mother's Day early with the fam-  we had 8 adults and 4 littles- From the moment we sat down we were flooded with anxious servers ready to attend to our every need- no glass went until led- chips and dips were a plenty and our entrees were generous, flavorful and authentic! 
The entire experience received 12 thumbs up from my family- which is almost unheard of- if you're in Summerlin- craving real Mexican food - this is it!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place . Always looking for good Mexican breakfast. Chorizo & eggs is my fave & it was great with warm handmade tortillas. We were welcomed warmly & service was outstanding.  looks like we will be back for dinner soon ."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My sister and I had dinner here earlier and the food was phenom! We were looking for somewhere close to home and this came up on Yelp! The name sounded familiar to me but I didn't put two and two together that this is the sister restaurant to the location downtown. Have been there many times and the food was always impeccable! So glad we chose this tonight. Service was quick and the food was fantastic! And of course the churros hit the spot at the end! Thanks for the great dinner Casa Don Juan! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant! Great Food! They have happy hour. We will go back again and again. Great Mexican food best I've had in Vegas. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is just as great as their downtown location except here, it's not nearly as busy and the restaurant is huge! Casa Don Juan has to have the best Carne Asada I've ever eaten and they cook it however I want it, usually medium rare. The staff is always friendly, the facility is always clean and I love free chips, salsa and beans!"}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican restaurant in town!!  Everyone who works there are so friendly and make you feel at home!  Their food is super good!  Service is excellent!!  Not to mention that the owner himself -  Raul is there to open the door & welcome you at his new restaurant in Summerlin!!   In addition, the restaurant is festively decorated like a Mexican hacienda!  I just love Don Juan's!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, very friendly, & we really enjoyed the food!!!   It was my husband's birthday lunch & they sang to him too!  Very clean & super made on premises tortillas.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars because of one thing sucky sauce on the chilaquiles I ordered the red sauce it lacked flavor was super tomatoey and not spicy at all! Coming from a San Diego born Mexican it's really hard to find good Mexican food in Vegas this place has a few good things but overall falls into my category of meh Mexican food! What saves them is great service our waiter was new and didn't know much but he's was kind and willing to find out for us. He also brought me some spicier salsa it was an habanero one that was barely spicy and didn't help much. The tortilla s are hand made so are very delicious. The rice and beans are edible which to me is surprising and The restaurant is cute the outdoor area is very spacious and shaded for nice afternoons. I've also had huevos rancheros at the downtown location and they were actually pretty good! Maybe since this was a different location they use a different sauce. I might be back to try their lunch or dinner but I'm not overly optimistic. Sometimes homemade is the only way to get what I want!"}
{"text":"Came to casa don juan on Tuesday and ordered the green sauce chilaquiles with steak and I must say they were delicious, I really recommend this dish.  The hostess welcomed us with a smile and the service was outstanding. Our visit was perfect.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"5 stars as ALWAYS w our favorite server Jose Hernandez !!! Love love love Casa Don Juan and the impeccable service we ALWAYS receive!!!"}
{"text":"I took my lunch group to the Casa Don Juan in Summerlin. My husband and I usually go to the downtown location. This Summerlin location was great. We had 17 people and the wait staff was wonderful. We were all served with hot delicious food and we got our separate checks we always need. I didn't have a margarita but one of the group said they are excellent. We will go again as several others in our group said they would be back."}
{"text":"FIRST AND FINAL VISIT

Food fair at best.  Service for our large group was excellent.  My enchiladas were tasteless.  Others in the party said their entrees were only fair compared to most other Mexican restaurants west of the Strip.  Juan's Flaming Fajitas on Tropicana continues to remain the best in town."}
{"text":"I hate to have to give a 1 star review because my whole family loves to eat here, but I was completely ripped off last time I was here and won't be back. 
I asked for a bean tostada, which was not on the menu, but it's basically what they give every table for free, chips, bean dip and salsa. Since it's not on the menu, instead of charging me appropriately, for a side of beans, they charged me for a meat tostada at $8.99. I complained to the cashier and she said there was nothing they can do. 
Never going back :("}
{"text":"Been searching for a Mexican restaurant since we moved here 8 months ago. We finally found it!
Tried it for lunch.  Great outdoor area. nice
atmosphere, very clean. 
Everyone was very friendly, fast service,
white cheese dip vs yellow...we loved that!
Complimentary chips, salsa & bean dip. 
I ordered the Vegetarian Burrito, it was delish! It was also huge! The tortillas were fresh and homemade.
Hubby ordered the special...both were $8.99ea, so much food, took half of each home. 
Didn't try the margarita's this time (a little early) but sure will next time..soon!!"}
{"text":"Omgosh! This place is amazing the food the vibe the restaurant is so positive and amazing! 
The food was amazing, I ordered something I usually don't ever order but it was amazingly delicious! 
Our server was so very polite and so nice! They even provided us with some spicier salsa!!!"}
{"text":"A truly great restaurant.  We look forward to coming here every time we are in Vegas.  Wish they would open one in San Diego!  Everything is really good here.  Service is fun and friendly.  There are a few Casa DonJuans in Vegas and they are all great!"}
{"text":"The Mexican food is pretty decent here. I was not so impressed with the quality of the margaritas though. The mix and tequila used for their standard margaritas tasted similar to those you get in a casino bar. For the price I feel it should have been higher quality. They had nice decor in the restaurant and the staff was very friendly. I did enjoy the Spanish rice as it was more of a wet rice and not the normal dry style."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times and love it. Last night we had a server named Jose Hernandez. I gotta say that the service will always make the place or break it. His service for sure made the dinner that much better. Jose is great at what he does and provides great service. We will be back and asking for him on our next trip in to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican I have ever had. We come here every week. Sanchez is an awesome waiter and their service is always great!"}
{"text":"We ate here a few days ago. It was our first time there. The service was horrible. The server although very nice was extremely busy. It took a while to get our drinks and after waiting a long time for our server to take our orfer, we had to get more chips and salsa as we were hungry. When we did get our food it was delish! Hopefully if we return the service will be better!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal when it comes to Mexican food. The tortillas are all made here, and the dips for introductory chips were excellent. For the main meal I had chicken enchiladas (which I highly recommend). Each bite was always better than the last one, as the sauces and spices gave it a true homemade taste. Drinks wise, I will recommend their margaritas as it was just the right temperature, and the taste was to order two more! I enjoyed my visit and will certainly return again."}
{"text":"I Yelped this place to find some decent food in the area and I was so thankful I did!! It turned out to be delicious with home made tortillas the lady was making right in front of us and the service was even better then the food which is rare these days! Billy our waiter shook our hands as he gave us the check and thanked us for allowing him to serve us tonight and the bus boy noticed me looking around, asked if I needed anything and when i asked where the restroom was he walked me to the other side of the restaurant to show me. I'm blown away!!! This is definitely going to be a regular spot for us when we come back into the area."}
{"text":"I had the breaded talapia! Very good! Servers were nice and the food was AMAZING! Efrain was our server and the bussers were very attentive!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place was my margarita . I had the cranberry kiss it was very tasty but for ten bucks would have thought you would get more in a bigger mason jar .As for the food ...it was krap I ordered chicken enchiladas and  the chicken meat was pink and some type of cheap mixture ! If your going to charge to the tune of $13 for a plate maybe you should quit being cheap and use all white meat !!! Or warn your customers of the lower grade , pink, chicken you use in your enchiladas so gross !! $25 bucks not well spent ! Iam so not happy !!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The service is amazing and the food is delicious. We go here every weekend. It's my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service overall. Staff greeted us. The setting was uniquely cultured and interesting. There was a lot of tasty meals listed on the menu. We had chips w/ salsa and beans that were warm. I ordered chimichanga which was a huge plate which made me full with the beverage of horchata. General presentation of food was good. Portion was to the max great and more than enough to last me the whole day. Excellent job!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, amazing food, amazing service.  Juan the waiter is a stud. He made the whole night great. Can't wait to come back. 

.........

Great place !!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!!   Food quality and service was consistently great.  Servers are always so friendly and accommodating.   Have come with large groups and small groups.  Service is always overly friendly.   Can't find one thing wrong with this place.   Food is so authentic.  Our last server was Jonathan.  He was amazing!!!   Try this place.  You won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the original location and this one does not disappoint either. I ordered the apple cider margarita, which didn't skimp on the tequila, and the al pastor burrito with green sauce. Probably the best burrito I've had in a while. Free chips, salsa and bean dip are always a positive. And the restaurant staff were friendly and extremely attentive. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome great food awesome people loved their agua de mango refreshing and great flavor also hand made flour tortillas try the queso dip everything was delicious. When we come back to visit Las Vegas we will definitely be back thank you."}
{"text":"Great Food! Huge Selection! Kyle was nice and attentive. We had cheese dip to start, beef chimichanga and 3 enchilada platter. Service was friendly and prompt. We will be back. Found this place because I tan at body heat. Also doesn't hurt to have a groupon to try a new place!"}
{"text":"Bomb! The chips/salsa and bean dip are 10 thumbs up! 



We ordered an Asada wet burrito plate (green AND red sauce please) green sauce is like a picante lime (huge fan) and the red sauce was more tomatoe based (still bomb) 

And all the tequila brands you could possibly want ! 

Order the flan!!! So spongey 

Our bartender Xavier is the perfect balance between attentive and leaves you alone. Love this place"}
{"text":"Being of this side of Las Vegas...the Summerlin part is hard when it comes to real Mexican food.  Don Juan you guys are......as close to authentic as you can get in this area...I do enjoy the vibe of this restaurant and the food is better than good the service is great.... I can tell you blow that dump Nacho Daddyaway.   You come a close second to lindo Michoacán almost tie...but if I want real authentic I quess I have to drive to the East side of Las Vegas to Taco El Gordo or Taco Y Taco.
Not putting you guys down...but reality"}
{"text":"We had a party of four here for a mid afternoon meal. Luckily I was just thirsty so I ordered  Margarita. I was very disappointed as it was super watered down.  I've had limearitas with more taste. I hold the Margaritas at Lindo Michoacon as a comparison so this fell flat. The food was \"meh\" and overpriced. I will make the drive to Lindo on West Flamingo. BTW, for all you Margarita fans, try Nacho Daddy in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Love the new location in Summerlin. Since i love near by. I might go often. 
They drink menu in this location looks like they have more variety compared to the one on down down Las Vegas. 
We weren't that hungry so my wife and I shared some fajitas and tried mango and tamarind margaritas."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food is really hard to find in Las Vegas. And I don't mean \"Americanized chain restaurant style\" either. Don Juan's nails it. Get anything with chicken in it. Their chicken is packed full of flavor and it's moist--not dried out like most places. Tamales are outstanding. Tomatillo sauce is better than mine! And you have to try the lavender margaritas...unbelievably and decadently tasty. Oh yeah...service is awesome too. ;-)"}
{"text":"Food very good as usual, waiter accommodating for aunt's 91st bday. Service has always been good, but in past has been to quick and food not so good. To fast if you know what I mean. But as of late, been very good again. Always busy here, and string drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and margaritas with some buddies on a Thursday night. Our server Allen was great, and the food was spectacular. Fajitas were excellent and my friends dishes looked pretty good as well. can't go wrong with this joint!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, great size portions. Service was superb.  They start you off with chips, bean dip and salsa. A lil pricey for Mexican food but the quality and quantity of the food are worth it. They have a full bar menu as well."}
{"text":"This is the go-to place for Mexican food in Las Vegas! Don't miss out on the $8.99 lunch specials. Homemade tortillas, fajitas and the cheese dip are the best in town! 
Lastly, the service takes this to a perfect score!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best restaurants, Mexican restaurants in the valley,.  We would drive all the way from Summerlin to the one on Main Street.  Then one day the building across the street closed down and up went Casa Don Juan restaurant.  I could not believe my eyes, it is now in my backyard practically.  The salsa Roja hands down rocks! What a great lineup of margaritas from mango to pomegranate. The staff is always great to me as well as the owners.  When I'm really feeling down and I need to pick me up I'll go there, just to see Juan.  He so attentive, he cares about you not only as a customer, but as an individual, he knows my order even before I  Think about it.  He definitely is an asset to your company with his smile and his hugs and his hospitality. Keep him around he makes my day because its \" Juan day one day at a time\" ...boom Shaka lacka ... don't ignore this post at least give it a try you will not be disappointed, open late. Try a combination plate! Decor is fantastic, Frida, for those Frida Kahlo fans."}
{"text":"Awesome place , superb  food and customer service . Will certainly come back to it when in Vegas again"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. This location is clean, fresh and open with plenty of seating inside and out. The service was great, food was delicious and I seriously can't get enough of their handmade fresh tortillas! So happy we don't have to make the trek downtown now that there's a summerlin location although, we would if we had to bc it's that good."}
{"text":"Great food!   Love the location! They treated us like family! We've been going to the one on Main Street for years.  So happy to see one in the Northwest!"}
{"text":"Do not order thru UberEATS! 2 times i have placed an order and both times have been shorted food! They offer to bring you your order but what good is it if now I have to wait to eat since my wifes order is not here! They need to do something to ensure the order and total measure up! You would think that they see the total for an order with the amount of food bagged and go hmmmm, something does not measure up! Very disappointed with the service and restaurant! Wish I could give them no stars!"}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan catered our going away party and I am so happy we chose them! Mirna was so helpful and easy to reach. It was a completely stress free event in regards to the food, which tasted awesome! Everyone loved it. The day is the event everything was ready to go on time. I would definitely recommend using them if you need catering."}
{"text":"Overrated & underwhelming.

I'm not really sure why this place has 4 stars because the food was underwhelming. It wasn't bad, but not great, just meh. I tried the fajitas, both beef and chicken, both were okay but lacked that sizzling, authentic Mexican taste in the seasoning and smoky grilled flavor that accentuate the flavor of the meat. The sides of beans and rice were very small in proportion to the meat, and were lacking in flavor. Just when I thought the dishes could be somewhat salvaged by the salsa and guac', I was wrong, and both were bland as well. Service was almost non-existent. Our server wasn't as attentive as he should've been for a big party. If you don't really like your food seasoned or packing in flavor, then I guess this place might suit you, but then you wouldn't be able to call it authentic Mexican food. If you want a taste of amazing Mexican food, try Leticia's Mexican Cocina."}
{"text":"It's 840 PM and I tried to call and put an order for pick up, however, the lady that answered \"zita?\" Said they weren't taking orders because it's too busy.... never heard of that, but that's too bad."}
{"text":"I come to Casa Don Juan often. The service that I've received is amazing, the personal there are so professional, friendly and and attentive. Usually I spend between $150_ $200 and it is worth it because the food is incomparable delicious. I've also ordered food to pick up, their service and authenticity is fenomenal."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING! This place gave me, my 8 month old son, mother in law, and sister in law food poisoning the night before thanksgiving. We all had different plates with different proteins, so this is likely not the case of contaminated food from a distributor. Most likely some dirty line worker not washing their hands. Thanks for ruining thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Great food , Great service Joes Hernandez was our server .It was his 
first night as a server . He was great , very attentive we never needed to ask for a thing . We'll be back ."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Their \"house red sauce\" tasted like canned tomato paste. The drinks were also off. I asked if I could get a scratch margarita with premium tequila, I was given something that tasted like Jose Cuervo mix and Jose gold. The food and drinks were kinda shit, but the service was excellent. I will say that our server was very nice and wanted to make our table happy, but the food drink fell short and great service can only help so much."}
{"text":"My co workers and I decided to give Casa Don Juan a try and we were not left disappointed. They have an excellent range of lunch specials. I decided to have the cheese enchilada with green chili which was delicious. They have complimentary chips, salsa and beans for the table just an FYI in case you intend to order some. The servers were fast, attentive, and very nice. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this place definitely is one of the best in Vegas. One of the reasons I am giving 4 stars is because the food took a while compared to the other location and I like the decor of the other location better. I got the chips and guacamole to start, it was good but I prefer guacamole to have more of a spicy flavor in it. This one was very bland. My entree was 1 cheese enchilada and 1 cheese tamale. The cheese enchilada with green sauce was so good!! This is definitely my favorite place to get enchiladas. However, I ordered a cheese tamale and they brought me one with meat which as a vegetarian I can not eat. The waiter gave me a cheese one once I showed him mine had meat but it took a while so that is another reason I gave 4 stars. Overall, the service is friendly and the food is definitely good. Hopefully this location gets a little faster with their service in the future!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on my way home from work. The food was amazing and the portions were huge."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food in Summerlin. The queso dip is the best, just wish it came in a larger size! The salsa is always fresh, just the right amount of heat, served with bean dip and fresh made tortilla chips. I could just order the chips and dip and not even get an entree. Service is superb! They always take care of us well. Best Mexican food in the northwest area!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! I ordered the chilaquiles and not only was the flavor spot on, but the proportion were big! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have decided we will no longer visit this restaurant. We use to go here often since it's across the street from our house and we love Mexican food. We stopped going because they charged another parties dinner on our card and we noticed when we got home we had just paid $120 for two meals. We were given the run around all day trying to get the money reimbursed. They had a problem with it and it took up our whole day trying to get it resolved. Now, tonight I was craving a bean and cheese burrito with wet sauce and rice and beans on the side so I went and ordered that to go. When I got home, all I had was a wet bean and cheese burrito, no rice and beans. I was pretty upset since I just spent $14.05 for just a burrito and didn't get the full entree. My husband went back to the restaurant and they said that was correct, I had only ordered the \"wet bean and cheese burrito\". My husband said no, she spent $14.05 because it was suppose to be the entree. They proceeded to not agree and not fix the problem. My husband just said forget it and drove back home. That price is pretty outrageous for just a bean and cheese burrito with no meat but the main point is if the girl taking my order was actually paying attention, she would have heard that I wanted a wet burrito with rice and beans on the side. They don't care to make anything right with the customer when there's conflict. I work in customer service and if something is wrong, we do our best to fix it. This has happened to us twice and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a good experience with my husband and toddler...one of his first times out and we were nervous...but it went great and the staff was helpful. The service, overall, was very good and the location is nice. My husband loved his carne asada with an extra hot beef enchilada. I had the camarones a la diabla which was also good, although not as spicy or hot as I would like...still good! The salsa could also use a little bit more kick, but the tostadas were fresh and hot:) They were also great with getting our drinks. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great.
Service lacked in many areas. 
Our server Nate was friendly WHEN he was at our table, though that wasn't often. After we had finished our meal, it was about 20 minutes before he came back to check on us and bring the bill. 
My mother had a question and tried to ask a server assistant and he waggled his finger in my mothers face and told her to wait a minute. 

We won't be returning."}
{"text":"First time here at Casa Don Juan, but came with family that have dined here previously. 
ATMOSPHERE: Very nice decor (not as fancy as Pancho's-downtown Summerlin, but really adequate), clean in appearance, large outdoor dining patio and the parking was easy.
SERVICE: Our waiter, Jose and his second Victor were both very attentive, friendly and outstanding!
FOOD: The WINNERS were the Vuelve a la Vida Campecham (shared as an appetizer by 4 of us), the Fajitas (#24), the Chips and Sala (served pre meal at all tables) and the Guacamole (must pay for this to be added, but worth it). The Lingua (wet) Burrito (green spicy sauce) was very good, and the combo plate ordered fell into the same category.
All in all, the dining experience was memorable and the \"value\" factor (ergo 5 Stars instead of 4) was exceedingly met!
A definite RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"2 Stars for the food, wish I could give 5 for the service alone. GUAC was bland, ordered the shrimp tacos, the shrimp seemed pre/over cooked. From the looks of the outside and the pricing of menu items I expected better quality food. I've had some great Mexican food, viva zapatas is in north Vegas a bit of a drive but well worth it. I'll take the drive any day over convenience. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"First, but not the last time here...Great service from Alan, great food, and great prices.  I had the Chilaquiles with Carne Asada and it was wonderful.  I'll drive the extra distance to eat here again."}
{"text":"Food here probably rates three stars....its fine but somewhat pricey.  The service/ambiance boosts it up to my four star rating. Any restaurant that devotes an entire wall to paintings and photographs of Frida Kahlo deserves some extra credit. beware of upselling here. before we sat down..the hostess talks up their queso cheese dip and guacamole dip.  We agreed to the cheese dip sales pitch but at $6.50 and a very small portion..we were disappointed. Also...we ordered some margarita's with some \"premium\" liquor and thought $14 each was outrageous. Our server named Tirone was excellent. he and his assistant offered suggestions...told us some Mexico City stories..gave us extra chips and salsa... and refilled our water glasses when necessary. Food was fine. wife and I had cheese enchiladas with rice and refried beans. standard fare but good. My son had the chicken mole and proclaimed it excellent. overall..we got a lot of food and left happy. Place seems quite authentic."}
{"text":"Do you like Margaritas? Do you like Chicken Tacos?  Do you like fresh food and lively people?

Case Don Juan has it all, you will need to try one of the best Mexican restaurants in Summerlin, 

It always taste like my mom was in the kitchen making the food, it really that good.....  Don't miss out on great food and good people...."}
{"text":"I just found my new fav Mexican food spot. The drinks where amazing to start and the chips and salsa and guacamole amazing. The food was perfect and the atmosphere was absolutely amazing the one thing that could've change would be to get the fans going in the Aceon during dinner time when the sun is blasting through the windows. A bit on the pricey side but well worth it hard to go eat here on a diet and not want to eat everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Finally the original Casa Don Juan on Main Street opened up a sister restaurant closer to our side of town.  First off, they have patio searing which will be a huge hit for us come spring.  We love eating outside.  The bar area is very colorful & is separate from the restaurant. 
ALL of the staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.  No less than 3 people were at our table regularly checking in on us.  Our server Christian, was fabulous.  Very attentive!!
The food is just as good as the downtown location that everyone loves. Had the #35 - super burrito with chicken & loved it. I'll be getting that again.  The salsa they serve first is so fresh & I can't get enough of it.  My hubby a favorite is the cheese sauce (dip) with jalapeños - he said that should be put on every dish!"}
{"text":"Most restaurants get flustered with large parties, but we came here with a party of 14 for my father's bday and were treated amazingly! We had two waiters and several others check on us! The food is spectacularly delicious.  When you order the shrimp burrito,  you get a huge burrito filled with amazingly seasoned shrimp! The birthday tequila shot was thoroughly enjoyed by my dad! Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Found my spot.  Real tamales! Real horchata! Tacos are better than home made.  Staff is very friendly.  Hand made tortillas.  Place is very clean and welcoming parking not an issue."}
{"text":"Just newly opened and food is great! We always go to the one on main st now they are closer to us. Good authentic mexican food. Salsa and guacamole is good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tasty food and friendly service.  Get something to eat the chili verde sauce with--it's good!  Fat chicken tamale was delicious and the tortillas are the best I've ever had.  So fresh and addicting.  Come hungry and save room for dessert or at least make an effort.  Service is attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! I'll definitely be back!  I especially enjoyed the fried ice cream with fruity pebbles on the outside."}
{"text":"Good food and service! We sat on the patio, nice atmosphere. definitely will go again. My husband liked the Fresh squeezed lemonade as well."}
{"text":"Great margaritas.I wish I would've checked the reviews before I went. When we initially went in one of the staff asked us if we wanted guacamole and cheese dip before we sat down. We of course said yes thinking that was normal to have chips and dip at a Mexican restaurant before the meal. Of course when the bill comes we were charged an extra $10 or so for the dip. The queso dip isn't worth it. The guacamole was good. Just wished they would've told us first that it wasn't free."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here a couple times. I ordered the Burrito De Chorizo.  It was really yummy. The service was the best I've ever had. Food was great."}
{"text":"Been searching for some good Mexican food and finally found one! Was soooo good! Definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, after a second visit, this time for lunch, we were both extremely satisfied with our meals.  Lunch pricing is very reasonable, $8.99, and was great!  I had the chicken mole, she had the Chimichanga, con pollo.  Those dishes, coupled with the chips/salsa/bean dip that is complimentary, was more than enough for us to eat in one sitting, so we got to go boxes.  Prob my new fav Mexican joint."}
{"text":"Service here was very good and prompt there were not a lot of people here at this time. While having great conversation with my husband he noticed that his cup had lipstick on it and in this particular night i was not wearing any. We told the staff and they corrected it quickly. The food itself was very good. Would go back just would double check the cups."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! My boyfriend and I went here on a whim while visiting Vegas, and it was incredible!!!

The food came out super fast and was so yummy!! Everything tasted perfectly fresh and homemade! 

Our server Jose, was also absolutely amazing too!

We will definitely be coming back and I would absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! Owner presence (in a good way) and all the servers are very sweet and attentive. The food was fresh and not covered in cheese. We had a great experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy coming here on my lunches weekly when i have the server Juan. But tonight i came with a couple friends because we were craving a michelada. Our bartender Mayra seemed to not be too thrilled to have us in her section. She explained that they don't make micheladas without shrimp, which is odd,
Because I've ordered micheladas there without shrimp before... nonetheless, We ordered micheladas with pacíficos. She brought out our beers with salt and lime and no tomato juice/ Clamato... when i brought this to her attention, she had an attitude and brought us a small cup of Clamato for two \"micheladas\". At this point we were over the attitude and the disgusting drinks and left. Really enjoyed coming here because of Juan during lunch but probably won't be coming back again during dinner or for a quick drink any time soon."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is so good! The owner is very friendly and I love the cheese dip!! I would recommend it for anyone who likes excellent Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Not impressed @ all. It's expensive and the cook a lot of their food with lard, including their rice, which I've never heard of and I'm Mexican, so I guess my expectations are pretty high."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's rare to see a business has 4 stars, so we came to try it out. I walked in thinking it was going to be packed, it was busy, but we didn't have to wait at all. Chips and salsa/beans came right out. Anyways, food was awesome!!! Less expensive then \"On The Border\" with better food, and larger portions! This place is legit! Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Ok so this review has nothing to do with the food (because I have yet to try) and instead is all about their amazing Micheladas!!! I've popped in here a few times for happy hour (3-6pm) and have left happy each time because their Micheladas are some of the best I've had in the area. This is my go-to beer drink and I make them myself at home so I'd like to think I know my Micheladas. They have Bohemia beer which right away is a plus because a lot of Mexican/Spanish food restaurants don't have it for some strange reason. The mix they use is devine, it has the perfect taste and is only slightly spicy. They dress it with a Tajin rim and a skewer of lime, jalapeño, and a cocktail shrimp. I had chips and salsa along with a small bowl of dipping beans along with my drinks each time. The salsa is great too, not too much tomato sauce. But the beans were my favorite, I about licked that bowl clean."}
{"text":"Lived in Las Vegas over 20 years first time ever going in to this establishment tonight must say the chips salsa and bean dip were fantastic!!! I also had a mango margarita which was delicious as well as the Carnitas dinner which was also fantastic! My husband ordered a combo dinner with a pork tamale beef taco and chili releno also very very good! The staff was super friendly and courteous and welcoming I would definitely recommend this restaurant for food and service"}
{"text":"The reason I gave it a 2 was because of the food. 
The service was awesome, very friendly and fast. 
Do not order the guacamole, it taste like an imitation.
 I saw another review stating to save your money and go to Robertos tacos and he was right! I think Roberto has better burritos. The carne asada taste reheated. 
I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Friends brought us to this location for Dinner and I didn't realize it was the same chain as the one on Main Street until I saw the menu. Super nice waiter, but this location is no better than the Main Street location and I'm still 0 for 4 in enjoying any meal. Even the nachos and salsa/bean dip/guacamole were bland and flavorless. I have to stop giving this place the benefit of the doubt...it always disappoints."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby and son yesterday, all in all everything was great including our server and service. We were seated right away and got to order our drinks. Our drinks came out fast as well.  The food is awesome the only reason i give 4 stars is because they need bigger portions! But great food and great service. I recommend this place to whoever is in the for mexican!"}
{"text":"Great location clean facility. Sadly the food here isn't as good as the original one. Tried this place 2 times and I'm done. Rice was oily and under cooked. We ordered stuff that we had to ask multiple times for. The chicken enchiladas there are bland and the red sauce taste salty and likes can off spaghetti O's! The fresh flour tortillas were burnt and  brittle. Ordered my picky kid a basic burger and fries to have the fries be frozen in the middle! Come on really? Two stars for the friendly staff and quick seating but food wise go elsewhere people"}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. A star off because the prices are a little on the steep side. 2 chimichangas and 2 margaritas were close to $55. ¡Ay Yi Yi!"}
{"text":"Last minute decision to stop here for dinner. Good choice.

Warmly greeted at the door and seated quickly. Happy hour margarita available at 2 for $8.99 so ordered that plus a glass of water so we could peruse the extensive menu. Fresh chips with salsa and bean dip delivered to the table. Chips were not greasy at all as per other reviews. 

My friend went with the Super Burrito, with carne and pork. He managed to get through about 3/4 before declaring himself stuffed. I had the carne asada plate at $15.99, and it was so much food that I had to pack half to take home. I felt the prices were fair for what you got, which was good quality food. 

No complaints at all other than you can't get the bacon wrapped shrimp other than with the mega meal package. My friend used to go to a place near Encinitas just for these bacon wrapped shrimp and was excited to see them, but alas, we coudn't get them as an appetizer. Sad face.

Overall, quality food, plenty of it. Prices a bit high but not outrageous. Drink prices did look a bit spendy though, so go during happy hour. Nice, clean place, and very good service."}
{"text":"I go here often for dinner very fresh and very authentic the staff is always  friendly and the restaurant is always clean #14 is my favorite meal"}
{"text":"Omg finally a good Mexican restaurant by the house! The cheese and jalapeño dip and guacamole is to die for. Great service and they have so many drink options. My family and I will def be back. Nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered here so far is super good! The chilaqules are so good I loved the green sauce ones."}
{"text":"Great food, only reason why I'm not rating as a 5 is because of the Pina Colada tasted a bit funny, it was frothy instead of ice blended. Fajitas were delicious, the servers were very nice and attentive.  The wait for the food after ordering was fairly quick.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"After a fellow Yelper recommendation we tried this place out.  Having not found quite our \"go to\" Mexican place in Las Vegas we were hoping for a score with Casa Don Juan.  This location has a fabulous outside eating area, which was perfect to try out with the long waiting line.  The chips and salsa were fresh, however not the best I have ever had.  The margaritas were super!  The Cadillac was my fav of the day...:). The service wasn't bad, especially considering how busy they were on a Sunday afternoon no less!  The prices were a little high I thought considering the portion sizes and it was lunch time.  Really there wasn't much difference between the lunch and dinner prices.  While this won't make the top of our Mexican food list for LV, I would still recommend it was a solid option."}
{"text":"Casa Don Juan ROCKS!!! Just had my son's graduation dinner there. We go all the time because we love it so much!!! So when we asked our son where he wanted his graduation dinner his pick was Casa Don Juan. There were 18 of us from 5 yrs to 85 yrs. I cannot express how impressed  everyone was. The service was outstanding, the food so delicious, the drinks so good!! Is the first time I've had such a big croud and every single person was happy with EVERYTHING!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, Alan was our server and I couldn't have had better service. Definitely recommend the Watermelon Jalepeno Margarita. Really good food , for sure we are going to be visiting this place more often"}
{"text":"We left catina laredo in Tivoli village because of the poor service and landed at this little diamond a few miles away. It was the best choice of the week. As soon as we set down we had chips and salsa and menus. The staff was nice and we had a group of 8 no mixed up orders, no problems, food was good and drinks were on time!"}
{"text":"My last visit was today.  Happy hour was clearly posted and explained the specials \"241\" Juans Margaritas and 20% off menu items. We have received this happy hour special before, so we had no reason to believe it wouldn't be honored today.  The manager/owner would not honor it.  She said we were still getting a good deal.  She did not care we were returning patrons.  She did not care we had received this happy hour special before.  She did not care her signage clearly stated the specials. She did not care that her servers had already clearly stated the clearly posted specials. She did not want to honor her specials.  It's just the principle. I do not help keep people in business that are dishonest and do not welcome my business.  Go to Leticias in Centennial!"}
{"text":"Save your money and just go to Robertos taco shop. Pretty much the same quality of food for 1/4 the price. $75 spent on food that tasted reheated or that's been sitting in a steam table. Took the server less than 1 minute to drop of food from time he left our table. . The tamale was allll masa with a hint of pork. $3.50 extra each to make a beer a michelada. Really?? Cost more than the beer!!  2 oz of \"cheese dip\" for $6.50!  It was basically cream cheese sour cream and a couple slices of jalapeño. Tasted like straight sour cream. 

The one star is for the service. Server was really nice and friendly. 

Left feeling cheated. DEF not \"authentic\" Mexican food. More like cheap Mexican fast food but a lot more expensive."}
{"text":"Absolutely would not recommend to new customers. Meat was rough I didn't eat but one bite asked for meal to be replaced or taken off. Manager said no but he will box up the order for me."}
{"text":"Oh my. Fresh made tortillas and nothing is greasy! So fresh and sooooo good. I'm not even a mex food fan but I'm addicted"}
{"text":"First time there had free entree coupon from local mailer.  Enjoyed a great heuvos rancheros.  Excellent three layers with sautéed onions and strips of grilled peppers - most tasty. Instead of tortillas the layers were made of the same pastry as the taco bowls!! Very much enjoyed their take on a simple southwest breakfast.  
The chips and guacamole were very tasty we ended up being offered to take home the balance of our chips and salsa for later.  Happy hour during the week from 4-6 with some good looking deal. Definitely plan to come back to try that.  Enjoyed some tap beer, cold and good size portions."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp.
My boyfriend and I went in on a Saturday night they were steady.
We sat in the bar area the waiters over there are attentive and quick.

We ordered taquitos as the appetizer and half a dozen tamales for the entree.
The salsa that comes with the chips at the beginning is delicious!

Anyway, the food took awhile to come out and they brought the taquitos and the tamales out at the same time, so that was a bummer.

But it was still delicious.

Will return."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in town!  The food is delicious, and our favorite waiter, Mr. Lozada, always takes great care of us!!! The atmosphere is warm and friendly, and we eat there 2-3 times a month!!!  Love this restaurant!!!i"}
{"text":"My order was to go. The first question that I asked was if it came with rice and beans.  I was told yes. I got home to find a whole plate of beans and cheese and no rice.  It was about 7 pm, I was tired and starving and now I was upset.  When I was going to call the restaurant, there was no phone number listed on the receipt.  Had to find the phone number on line and it was always busy.  I went back to the restaurant only to find that the person that took the order was very defensive and non-apologetic.

I requested my money back and the process was chaotic as well.  Ultimately, the manager tried to fix things, but by then it was too late.  Never again.  Very incompetent staff."}
{"text":"We just ate at Casa Don Juan today for the 4th time, enough times to get a pretty fair sense of this restaurant. It has been consistently good, without exception. Their food is well prepared, hot, very tasty and nicely proportioned. Their staff has always been exceptional...well-dressed, courteous, accommodating and attentive. And when's the last time you saw a staff member at a restaurant...any restaurant...dusting the accent pieces with a Swiffer and using a broom and dust-pan to sweep a barely-noticeable scrap of paper off the floor. We're impressed with the quality and attention to detail  at this restaurant!"}
