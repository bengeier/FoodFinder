{"text":"We were in town visiting from NY and loved the food in this place so much that we came back on the last day of our weekend trip to grab a quick bite before getting on the road.  

The staff was very unwelcoming and there was a huge dead fly at the bottom of one of our salads - it looked like it was marinating in the dressing.  I took it to the woman behind the register.  She looked at me and didn't say anything.  We continued to sit outside for a while after and saw her come out for a cigarette - at no point did anyone apologize or address the issue with us.  

I come to Montreal often and would never go back to this place.  Service and cleanliness is everything!"}
{"text":"A cute coffee shop that we visited for desserts, tea and coffee. A few gluten free options as well. Such as brownie and double chocolate cookie. Nothing spectacular but a cute shop for a small desert."}
{"text":"Location: In HoMa. Street parking is available [metered] and you can likely find a non-zoned spot on a side street - check the signage. 

The place: I was out exploring and needed a place to warm up, so since this was in the neighborhood, I decided to stop in. It's a decently sized coffee shop with several tables, large windows at the front and an average decor. When I arrived, it was pretty full but I was able to get a table. Based on my observations, I'd say this is another neighborhood spot where locals go to connect with each other. The fellow behind the counter seemed to know many clients by name so it gave the place a homey feel.

The goods: I got the usual Macchiato, and because I checked in with the Yelp app, I also got a free croissant. Bonus! Now, let's start with the coffee. I didn't like it. It was too bitter for my taste. They use an Italian brand that I've never heard of but that's OK because I won't be looking to buy it. The croissant however, was delicious! Soft and buttery and fresh - it was pretty big too. These guys also offer breakfast (basics) in case you're feeling super peckish. 

Service: Great! The two people who were behind the counter were really friendly, and even though the check-in offer was for a medium or large 'specialty' coffee, they gave me the croissant because technically, a Macchiato is a specialty coffee - you just can't size it up.

Price point: I think the Macchiato was $3.

All in all, even though I didn't like the coffee all that much, I liked the vibe of this place and would pop in again."}
{"text":"A cute little coffee shop. Lots of seating! Good coffee! And a free croissant with your first check in! What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Première visite au Café des Alizés hier après une longue marche au Jardin botanique qui n'est pas très loin. J'ai savouré un bon petit gâteau aux carottes (quand c'est un petit gâteau, es-ce qu'on dit \"aux carottes\" ou \"à la carotte\"?)avec un chai latte... qui était un peu trop du côté \"latte\".

Agréable en général, mais mauvaise prévision de l'achalandage! Un seul employé pour une bonne vingtaine de clients sur place, sans compter ceux qui prenaient des commandes \"à emporter\". Une petite terrasse à l'extérieur ajoute au charme de l'endroit qui fait partie de la tendance de revitalisation de la rue Ontario dans Hochelaga."}
{"text":"The loft we were staying at was very close to this place so I went here for my morning coffee fix. Got a medium cappuccino. Wasn't the best I've had, but it was quite good. Was clumsy enough to knock over a cup at the cream& sugar station and the owner was very courteous in asking me to not worry about it and that he'll clean it up."}
{"text":"Ambiance calme et intime avec une superbe vue sur le parc Simon Valois PI. La musique jazzé donne un ton actif mais sans stress au petit café qui se marie bien avec l'énergie et l'enjouement des employés. Bien que ce soit principalement un café, ils offrent aussi d'excellent repas faisant preuve d'une intéressante et délectable combinaison de couleurs et saveurs. La présentation soignée des plats, d'une apparence bistro classique, met l'eau à la bouche. Un accès WiFi gratuit et les murs garnis d'une magnifique galerie d'art moderne est à votre disposition si vous désirez vous occuper tout en sirotant votre café."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé ce café! 

C'est assez grand, le décor est moderne et il y a beaucoup de lumières. J'ai pris une tisane, servi rapidement et à table par le barista, qui était très gentil. 

Un bon endroit pour se reposer tranquillement ou pour discuter, la musique d'ambiance n'étant pas trop forte."}
{"text":"I don't just patronize Café des Alizés because I can't avoid it on my daily errand run. They've got the goods (and a Facebook page!).

About a wall and a half of windows help light up this modern space during the day. There's ample seating on the inside, and several tables just in front of the business.

The menu is classic: coffee/espresso drinks, fresh smoothies, pastries (many of which on display in one of those refrigerated see-through cases you want to smudge with the tip of your nose in a vain attempt to smell through the glass), and a mouth-watering breakfast and lunch menu that doesn't discriminate against when you've got a craving.

Morning Bonus: The employees are sweet no matter how early it is."}
{"text":"It's a small cute place located outside of the tourist areas, so this is the place where you non-french speaking tourists should have a  heads-up. 
They understand English but the unwillingness of communicating in English (two workers spoke French to me 100% of the time), it is pretty unprofessional in my opinion but I was lucky enough to understand a little French to know what they were talking about. 
Latte was delicious and their croissant was crunchy and it was a cozy place to be, so the food and drinks is not the issue here."}
