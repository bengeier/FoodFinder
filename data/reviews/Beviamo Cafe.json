{"text":"Have been there a number of times and told the barista to make me something hot and sweet.  He did not disappoint.  Small, quaint, friendly.  And great coffee and light food.  What more do you need! You need to go there."}
{"text":"Beviamo is the best addition to Tremont! The staff is always so friendly and personable - and they are ALWAYS willing to give suggestions or answer questions. It is the perfect small neighborhood cafe that Tremont needed! In addition to the great service, the food and drinks are awesome. It is food you can feel good about eating. I recommend any of the date bites, the DK bowl is my absolute favorite, but all of their bowls are good, the Power Up smoothie and matcha latte are my favorites - but honestly, you can't go wrong with anything. We love Beviamo! :)"}
{"text":"The friendliness of the workers and casual atmosphere is the cherry on top of the delicious menu items in this cafe"}
{"text":"Beviamo has always been a conundrum to me - it's decor is eclectic but in a way that really doesn't totally go together. They don't have enough seating to really hang out, and they BLAST rap and r&b that make it really unpleasant to stay inside. You can't hear any friends when they talk which seems really weird for a coffee place. Their menu is progressive for Tremont and I appreciate their vegan friendly menu. Their date and oat balls are much better than other alternatives I've had in the past and my friend really liked their granola bars. I just wish they had better ambiance and a clearer value proposition - I can't really tell if it's a vegan restaurant or a coffee shop or a post-workout smoothie snack place."}
{"text":"Visited Beviamo for a morning work meeting and was greeted by a very nice guy that let me know about the new menu. I love all the healthy choices they have and decided on an almond milk latte and the fruit yogurt parfait. Both were lovely and he even added fresh strawberries for me that aren't typically included. I think my total for both was $7. The atmosphere is quaint and a lil funky which I liked. Music was playing but not too loud and thought it was a great meeting spot. There isn't a ton of seating so if it was busy you may have not gotten a seat. I definitely want to go back for the smoothies and bowls they have to offer."}
{"text":"such a cute and relaxing atmosphere. great coffee, lovely and attentive staff and a unique presence. #DrinkTogether"}
{"text":"I Love their soups! I think they are best known for the soups now! 

This place recently opened their new space, with a grand opening soon. It's an incredible spot that you should all check out! For however much I HATED Kalahari, I LOVE this place equally as much!!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in Tremont. The barista was really friendly and the overall vibe was very relaxing. I'm a huge match a fan so of course I had to try out their iced match a latte and it there was no disappointments. I also ordered their avocado on a bagel, recommended by the barista and it was very good indeed! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Gud place ths, tho vry smal, i wud try 2 find a place anthr tym as wel..! nt jst milk, bt also passion nd interest ws poured in2 the cofe..! gues wat.. the flavor ws perfekt..! Wel, hw cud it b any les..?!"}
{"text":"What a great find!!! I stopped in for coffee 5 minutes before close and was welcomed like an old friend; this is what makes Northeast Ohio special. The coffee was fantastic. I tried a single source roast from Cleveland based roaster Heartwood for the first time and I loved it! I bought beans to take home and let me tell you they do not disappoint (small beans, nothing broken- no pieces, clean and smooth). Between Heartwood and Kent based roaster Bent Tree you cannot make a bad coffee choice at this cafe. Bravo Cleveland, bravo!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get much cuter. I have been wanting to come here for months and it totally lived up to my expectations. Their smoothies are out of this world and they have a refrigerated section with yummy, healthy treats/ snacks. I don't think you could go wrong with anything here. Their menu is great and you can also build your own smoothie. I had  the pumpkin bites as a snack...SO good!

Major plus--we had our puppy with us who was allowed to come in :) She had fun playing with Tink, who was also hanging out. The workers were extremely nice and welcoming. There is cozy seating to just chill out for a bit. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday, and it was a super yummy local cafe! It's the Philz coffee (in California) of Cleveland! The cafe is really cozy, and it offers a great selection of food and drinks. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the CLE area!"}
{"text":"Awesome little cafe! The smoothie I got was delicious and perfectly blended. They have all types of fresh breads and spreads. Yum! Can't wait to curl up in the window seat with a good book. Looks super comfy! Great addition to Tremont."}
{"text":"Quaint little juice/smoothie/food spot in the tremont area. Very friendly staff. Wasn't a huge fan of the food selection but love the smoothies. Next time I plan to try some banana sushi!"}
{"text":"Just what I needed to get my Saturday started. Delicious cold brew with almond milk & an acia smoothie (per the recommendation of a local); the toast options were enticing too!"}
{"text":"I just tried beviamo for the first time and was disappointed. I had an acia bowl and it was very runny and a pour over coffee that was served at room temperature. My husband had a bagel and the bagels are Cleveland bagel company and his bagel was delicious! I would be willing to give the place another try but would definitely get something different."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place on their opening day and loved the look of it. Beviamo is a quaint little coffee shop next to Barrio, with a relaxed modern vibe mixed and some pretty fun artwork. I stayed for a bit to get some work done with a friend, and although they had pretty limited seating, there were some really comfy chairs and good music. I got one of the teas, which came loose leaf in individual glass strainer pots. They were very particular about the water temperatures for each of the different teas, and you could tell that they really cared about the quality. Next time I want to try one of their smoothies (they had several to choose from). This is a great little coffee shop and an awesome addition to Tremont!"}
{"text":"The Beviamo bowl is delicious and light, and they've got great coffee.  Service is very gracious and welcoming.  Wonderful little place in Tremont."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time we go the barista is very friendly. The staff clearly have a passion for coffee and are happy to answer questions. Love all the healthy food options and really looking forward to trying their vegan sushi."}
{"text":"This is the kind of coffee house I look for! Solid choices of coffee from around the world, care in not only the beans, but in the process and even art of making a good brew. I have simple needs in black cup of coffee, but there's nothing simple about the care put into Beviamos staple product."}
{"text":"Being vegetarian is sometimes hard when you want something quick and easy. Well Beviamo cafe is just that. My first time there I was and my choices were between the Legend of Zaatar and the OG Avo. I luckily was able to try both because someone canceled an online order. Loved the OG Avo but not the Zaatar. It's probably an acquired taste but it just taste like I was eating sand. I went back to purchase a vegan cinnamon roll which was doughy but good. I do not recommend either sandwich if your goal is to be full. The sand was good but didn't fill me up. I have to go back and try to cheeseburger."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and found this cute little spot to get coffee. Owners were very knowledgeable on the coffee and tea and were able to help us make decisions. I had a matcha latte which was very good and all of the smoothies we had were excellent! Highly recommend! 

Also a good place to just chill and hang out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Beviamo for the first time this morning, enjoyed a delicious latte and fantastic customer service."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place with all of its healthy cafe options. I love acai bowls so of course I had to try one, it was awful! The base was super watery and soupy. I couldn't eat more than a couple bites. The only reason I gave 3 stars was because the service was very good and the guys in there are super nice. Also they have Cleveland Bagel Company bagels which are delish!"}
{"text":"Great little spot in Tremont. It won my heart pretty quickly by virtue of selling CLE Bagel Company bagels, which, until now, you couldn't get anywhere in the neighborhood. Beviamo serves all different kinds, with a bunch of schmear options, too. Try the rosemary salt bagel, untoasted, with raspberry goat cheese cream cheese! 

They've got tons of other goodies, too, including coffee-based \"mocktails,\" homemade smoothies, grab-and-go Lebanese food, sweet & savory toasts, fresh fruit, & individually wrapped Finally Ginger cookies (made in CLE - definitely try these!). I really love their vegan energy date balls, made with dates, oats, walnuts, almond milk, coconut oil, & peanut butter. They're a perfect little sweet pick-me-up - & healthy, too. 

A word to fellow work-from-home folks like me: There's not much space to sit inside Beviamo, & it's probably not a spot where you could or should camp out for any period of time beyond a quick coffee or lunch. Grab your food here then head to Civilization down the road to camp out for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"I think I'm missing something...after reading all the stellar reviews I was looking forward to the smoothie I ordered from here. 1st sip was a let down considering I couldn't taste any peanut butter or banana in my peanut butter banana smoothie. The only flavor I got continually throughout the half of a drink I actually consumed was ice; not the best!! 

It's a cute place and they're moving to another location soon, so I'll re-try but next time only for a coffee."}
{"text":"I am in love with this little cafe. The coffee is top notch, and each staff member is a legitimate barista with lots of knowledge and understanding about the process and technique of making good drinks. The food menu is vegetarian/vegan friendly with a strong Mediterranean vibe. My favorite part of going here is how friendly and personable the staff is -- they make everyone feel like family! I first went here because I live a few blocks away and wanted to support a small local business, but the quality of their coffee, delicious simplicity/healthiness of their food, and awesomeness of their staff has kept me coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Went here the other day and I was really surprised. The cafe is small and cozy and displays art from local artists. This place is so fitting for Tremont.  I had the opportunity to meet the owners Dan and Fran and they are super nice and knowledgable about the coffee and tea and snacks they offer. 

I tried the mango iced tea and it was amazing! I also had the bagels which are delivered from CLE bagel co and are good , but the real attraction is the schmear cream cheese options which are made there. I tried the chipotle chorizo, cheddar onion, and the thyme horseradish schmear. My fav was the chipotle. 

The prices are spot on and all ingredients are fresh and healthy. If your in the neighborhood and are in need of a nibble or a drink go here!!!"}
{"text":"We happened to stop by Beviamo Cafe without knowing what to expect, and ended up ordering the Siphon brewed coffee. I highly recommend it, between the super interesting set up to the delicious coffee (it's quite strong with a very clean taste), it was probably one of the best cups of coffee that I've ever had. It's not only a great cup of coffee, but a fun mini show watching it brew. I also had the cold brew which was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome little vegan cafe and coffee shop. The Princess Pesto bagel is one of the tastiest things I have eaten! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The previous location was much smaller, but still had a sunny, open door vibe. I'd come here if the weather isn't the greatest, because there's a variety of seating options, and plenty of space. Contrasting with the other Tremont options, it's about on par with Loop Cafe, minus the records and local art."}
{"text":"Just visited this morning with our pug, Minnie. She really enjoyed the ambiance and free taste of organic homemade peanut butter. Oh and our Power Up and DK Bowls were awesome with a bagel and a matcha latte. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great cozy homey vibe. Variety of drinks from coffee, tea to smoithies. I had their chi tea latte and really liked it. Also tried their Buckeye Banana Shush, which was yummy. I would like to go back and try a smoothie and some more of the menu. Definitely better than civilization. Still like loop but gave this place a better rating because of the larger menu and more cozy vibe. I really like loop also but it's more of a colder white wall metal kinda place than this place."}
{"text":"Awesome people, awesome music, and the coldest cold brew. The atmosphere is very chill with couches, video games in the back, and tables up front. Definitely recommend as a hang out on a Sunday morning"}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place.  It's more than just a coffee shop.  It's the intersection of unique brewing methods and satisfying, healthful food.  

It's super small and colorful which adds to its charm.  

Everyone is attentive though I'd suggest to go when you're not in a hurry.   It's not that it's slow; it's that the coffee takes a little longer to make and the shop is small.  Just enjoy the experience, sit back and relax, and have a great  cup of coffee and an avocado sandwich on a chewy, yet crusty Cleveland bagel!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't even take credit for discovering this place, but aren't all the best cafes introduced by word of mouth? A friend of mine was taken aback by someone's Beviamo To-Go cup at another hot spot in Tremont, and after an interrogation of the smoothie sipper, all was revealed about the new location and amazing renovation. I had personally never heard of Beviamo to begin with, and I'll be honest that I kept butchering the name - Beg me ano? Oops! We decided to take a little jaunt towards the new space and boy did I NOT know what was in store for me!

The sweet smells of peanut butter, banana, blueberries and more snuck into my nostrils as we entered this adorable cafe. There was a small grocery area with some local and delicious offerings upon your first steps in. Beyond lays the magical island of smoothie making, where many smoothicians and baristas wait for your order. Things got pretty wild when three menus were offered up - holy smokes - isn't this just a smoothie bar? No, you fools! Delish vegan cuisine and fantastic cups of Joe are aplenty! 

If all of these divine snacks and bevs weren't enough to awe you... come hither my fellow game lovers, and step into the magical backroom where a modded SNES awaits you - prepare for your whole afternoon to be taken as you dive back into the world of green mushroom heads, fire throwing Kombat characters, trippy race-car tracks, Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde (that's Ms. Pac-Man for you newbs out there) and SO many MORE games. I was in my very own version of Heaven. In fact, I contemplated not even TELLING anyone about this place for fear of its popularity. That's how you know I'm a true Yelp Elite. The business' success is more important than my own game-loving greed (but JUST barely)!

Please support local and check out this super sweet Tremont staple! There's even a wicked beanie bag in the back with your name written allllll over it. Lay on it! I triple dog dare you!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in. I was looking for a spot with some good soup. I saw a yelp review saying the soup was amazing so I decided to try it out. I got the GF avo toast with tomatoes. It came as a sandwich with two pieces of bread. I decided to take one side off to save myself the carbs. It was very good! Comes with seasoned salt and onion/tomato topping. YUM. The soup of the day was a vegan potato soup (I was kind of skeptical because I pictured it to be a creamy soup and creamy and vegan don't really go hand in hand). It actually was pretty good ! Comes with cut up pieces of carrots, onion, celery, & potato. And the latte was just your normal latte.. comes with a pretty leaf design (the picture was after a few sips... it was prettier before). The barista and the other gentleman working (I assume was the owner) were very kind. The barista explained the menu a little bit and was patient with me while I explored the menu. I was told that during the soft opened the shop is only open til 3. The hours will change once everything in the shop is finalized. The ambiance inside was very cool and relaxing. There was an area with flat screens, couches , and board games. What a fun little spot. Definitely will be back."}
