{"text":"Reza and Fara are extremely hospitable bakers who put quality in every bread. I love their Iranian-style flatbread topped with sesame seeds."}
{"text":"Located in strip mall at Yonge & Weldrick. Storefront only has 2 fridges with various cheeses, (unmarked) prepared foods and a small counter for the sangak bread. I only tried the sangak: crisp on the edges and chewy near the middle. $3.75 for 1 large piece. Lots of other locals also there to pick up bread too."}
{"text":"Uncle Reza has great selection of middle eastern traditional bread selections. Always fresh and delightful. Always welcoming and great customer service. Prices are very affordable and food is always fresh."}
