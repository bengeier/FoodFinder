{"text":"Food is very good, very comforting! Always have the pho, imperial rolls and a three color!!! YUMMY! Been going there since I was a kid, family that owns the place is very friendly."}
{"text":"This place was downright awful! Me and my wife both order different noodle soup. I order the traditional noodle soup (pho), the broth came out dark, tasted too salty (too much MSG) and the noodle was the wrong type and undercooked. My wife same experience with her pho with shrimps. We both order a medium, and what they brought was a small with hardly any noodle, plus the soup was not hot. It is suppose to be come out super hot so the meat will cook in the soup. I never paid for a meal, took 2 bite and walked out the store still hungry. I was so upset with my food that I asked my wife to pay quickly before I started to get angry and use four letter words for the disgusting food that was given to us both. What upset me the most about this place, it was freezing outside (-19) and when we sat down we were both given ice water? I asked for hot tea and the lady gave us tea that was luke-warm. It is the most stupid run business and they just don't respect the customer. Who serve stale old broth, with uncooked noodles and a very small portion at best. I personally took it as an insult to be provided this kind of service and to have to pay for it and walk out not having ate. Sorry but all the other reviews, they just don't know what *real* pho is suppose to taste like, my wife is Vietnamese and she said this was the worst she ever come across. I have 2 add only 1 other person was in the store, it was empty and that should have been our tip-off not to eat here!"}
{"text":"New location for Nam Do. Apparently also under new management.  It was disgusting and NOT like the previous Nam Do at it's old location. The special all dressed pho was NOTHING like you would expect an all dress pho should be. Everything was bad about it. Noodles were slimy, no raw sliced beef (I know right?!), broth was gross. Worst pho I've had in my life and I've had lots of pho. Do not go here!"}
{"text":"Tried Nam Do on St-Denis and Jean-Talon one night when Dakao was closed. The pho was good, but there was a little something missing in their pho broth.   For my full MTL Pho Hunt review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"There was no A/C inside, so we had to sit outside. The service was competent and reasonably quick. The noodles were average and were in general ok. Nothing special, but they were not gross. The chicken broth was very good in my opinion. It was just ok."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for brunch daily when I visited Montreal. As I grew up on Vietnamese food in LA, I needed my pho fix even in another country. Pho Nam Do didn't disappoint!  It was interesting to see the differences between size choices compared to America, as we only have M and L, and in Canada I saw lots of Vietnamese restaurants offer M, L, AND S. Also, the broth was lighter in color and taste than what I'm used to. I believe this is more a Vietnamese Southern-style pho place than the Northern-style phos I'm used to back in LA. Northern-style pho tends to be darker and meatier in taste, with less need of veggie garnishes--whereas Southern-style pho is the reverse.   None-the-less, the pho was delicious!  Though I have to say their imperial egg rolls were unimpressive.   I was surprised to see how little reviews there were for this place. Then I realized it's because it's such a local favorite that it's rare for outsiders to try it. Each time I went, I saw there was anything but a lack of customers. And on a special note I'd like to give a special shout-out to the Chinese-Vietnamese family (like mine) who owned the restaurant. They made me feel welcome. :)"}
{"text":"Saw the restaurant on the way to Jean Talon market and decided to try with my boyfriend. They have S, M, L different sizes of pho and you can choose meats to put 2-3 or one or all dressed.. The place is real Vietnamese.."}
{"text":"So far this is my favourite Vietnamese soup in the neighborhood. I've grabbed the vegetarian (#18) to go a couple times and the staff are always friendly, funny, sweet and super super speedy. The broth is flavour rich, not watery at all, and not too salty with a good kick of spice to it and very fresh veg. From the little time I've spent in there the decor is quirkycozy too, but honestly, I am hungry and just looking to cuddle into a giant bowl of Pho-times when I'm there and generally not seeing straight."}
