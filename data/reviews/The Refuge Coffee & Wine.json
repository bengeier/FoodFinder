{"text":"For an airport great selection fresh food & coffee not pre-made oh the most incredible staff and crew!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a hot latte and breakfast sandwich, and both were delicious! The baristas were friendly, there was music playing, the venue was clean, and the interior design was modern. It's worth seeking out if you're in terminal 4!"}
{"text":"Had a great fresh Bbq chicken wrap. Service was great. One of the employees, Darius, made it easy to figure out the menu and knew it well as to make a recommendation. I will definitely stop in next time I'm flying out from Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best, freshest airport food. I was stuck with a 3 hour delay. I sat near this place for an hour. After seeing how nice and happy the staff was, when dinner time came I chose to eat there. The food was cooked to order. Delicious. Fabulous coffee too!"}
{"text":"Coffee Proceeds - Help Support The Catholic Charities of Arizona. Your support can make a difference!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  JP and the team are fun, fast and friendly.  My first visit to PHX and will definitely be coming here on my next trip"}
{"text":"By far the best place in any airport.  Vanilla coffee frappacino was awesome but it's the employees that make this great.  They are always so nice.  I look forward to stopping here everytime I am at PHX."}
{"text":"The nicest people in the airport all work here. They are friendly, kind, encouraging, and they work fast! No grumpy faces here! The food is good and so is the coffee. Stop in on your layover and you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Mike and his cohort are welcoming, serving, and HILARIOUS!  If you need coffee before your flight- wait till you get to the B gates and get it from these two mad men!!!  Keep it up guys- you made my day!  PS- these guys can bench 350."}
{"text":"We came for some yummy lattes and we were definitely impressed with them! I had a caramel latte with almond milk & my husband had a vanilla latte, which we both enjoyed. So tasty and not overly sweet. The staff was really friendly & tried to get to know their customers in the brief encounter we had with them, especially being in an airport you don't often get that. I will definitely return if I am at this terminal."}
{"text":"Good wasn't anything special, but why I gave them 5 stars is because of the service. The gentlemen was so kind and sweet. You could tell they were having a great time! They brought my order to me instead of screaming my name, which goes incredibly far in my book. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Aw this place is so cute! Great coffee, fast service, and smiling faces behind the counter. Highly recommend if you're looking for a pleasant experience to go along with a great cup of coffee before your flight in the B Gate area"}
{"text":"JP and his team were AMAZING! I have NEVER had such personal service at the airport. I am in the service industry and it is obvious these people enjoy serving others as opposed to just trying to grab as much cash as possible. It was a refreshing experience! Thank you JP and all your fellow workers. I wish I could travel everyday just to hang out with you guys!"}
{"text":"Wanted a quick cup of coffee. Was helped by Darius. Super friendly, great service. He could give lessons in service!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good. Excellent food, great customer service, and fun staff making travel a little more enjoyable.  Excellent coffee.  This evening I had the chicken Panini with roasted red peppers and a Cabernet.   Both were infinitely better than you'd ever expect from a small hole in the wall like Refuge.  Absolutely will return whenever I fly - Phoenix Sky Harbor"}
{"text":"Ok. Seriously. I have been to hundreds of airport bars and restaurants across the country and this one has the best employee. John was energetic and very heplful when I approached him to order a glass of wine.  Every customer interaction I witnessed was nothing I have seen before. I am recruiting him to work for my firm when he finishes school.  Thank you for hiring a well rounded employee who treats people the way we all want to be treated.  Makes my trip to see my family, who I miss after being away for 5 days, a little easier. Great job on hiring a great human being."}
{"text":"I travel for work and I always make sure to stop at this little shop to grab some coffee because the staff there is always super friendly and doesn't silly dally! They bring a smile to my face every time I'm in there and there's always some jamming tunes on! Thanks DQ AND CHELA!!"}
{"text":"Gotta give 5 stars. So much energy here at 7 am. Friendly staff enthusiastically greets you, asks where you've been, where you're going and kick up the tunes when it's really good.  Breakfast panini solid. Coffee solid. Peeps knock it out of the park. Thanks Tai Anna (sp?) for the pick-me-up after a red-eye heading home."}
{"text":"Jumping between planes and found this great little coffee shop. Darius helped me. No lie, probably one of the most positive and upbeat people I've ever met my life!  Great spot. Try it!"}
{"text":"DQ and JP were absolutely stellar! We were delayed in the airport for almost 5 hours. These two outstanding young men were one of the reasons we spent that time at The Refuge.   Their customer service skills were above and beyond, not to mention the wine they recommended was delicious. I would visit again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh, made to order food and they have wine.  I got the caprese panini and it was ready in about 5 mins since there was no line.  It came with chips, delivered to my table and I had a nice glass of wine with it but the real bonus was the customer service.  The two guys working were friendly without being annoying and quick.  I also liked the tunes."}
{"text":"Cayenne Latte! Mmmmm. Jennifer was great.  She said she'd adjust the heat if it was too spicy.   The service was fast even though the line was a little intimidating."}
{"text":"I am in line this morning waiting to make my way upfront and come across a very hard working young lady, she was helping people in-line, serving coffee and muffins as well as handing out food! I was amazed at how quickly she worked , how efficient she was all the while holding a beautiful smile and great attitude! Kudos to the management for choosing such a good worker. Sadly before I could get to the front of her line, Angel was scolded for not going around a huge crowd of us. Clearly she was only doing her best! I am not sure that it ended well because she leaves shortly after. Now I may not have heard what was said behind closed doors but I do know what I saw and heard and I believe she should have been applauded for what looked to be an excellent job!  I hesitated to send this review but felt it necessary that it be pointed out to management that Angel was clearly only doing the best she could to give excellent customer service! My hats off to her and if I could employ her myself I would have stolen her!"}
{"text":"No joke: this might be the best customer service I've ever had. The two guys working the counter here improved everyone's mood. I'll be talking about this for a while."}
{"text":"One word: Darius. If you happen to travel through do yourself a favor, and go visit Darius. He will instantly put a smile on your face, and you can grab a glass of wine! Thank you for the smile!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here to get a water and some protein bars before hopping into my plane. The staff is ridiculously nice with a lot of Southern charm. However, the layout of this area is really really cramped and can make interactions with huffy airline passengers quite a nuisance. Come here for the service, but eat your food and drink your coffee elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best place I've ever eaten at in an airport. Customer service was great. Had the refuge breakfast wrap and it was huge! You can literally share with someone else. Liked how you can get a mimosa before your flight too. The AZ sunrise latte was really delicious and I'm not a really a coffee drinker."}
{"text":"I felt like I needed to go out of my to write this review. I travel quite a bit for work and have gotten coffee and breakfast in a bunch of airports. The food here and the coffee are great, but what made me want to write this was the staff. I was in the Phoenix airport exhausted and in a crappy mood. The 2 guys working when I walked up had to have been the coolest, friendliest, and funniest guys I had ever met. They completely flipped my mood around. The overall vibe was incredible. Thank You!"}
{"text":"My go to spot in when I'm at Sky Harbour! The staff is tremendously friendly and works hard to make each customer feel important. It's very apparent that everyone enjoys their job. Shout out to Darius for the great service, you're the man!"}
{"text":"Umm..I've worked at the airport for 4 years now and I'm just now discovering this coffee shop. Note: I'm not a coffee drinker so I always stop at Starbucks for my tea and chai lattes. Anyways, I tried them out the other day and the whole experience was great. The staff was amazing. All were super friendly, they made conversation, upbeat, real genuine. The music was good lol. They were jamming to some old school r&b hits which drew me in. I ordered a pumpkin spice chai latte with almond milk and espresso. Pumpkin spice in May?...I'll take it. Drink was super tasty as well.  Cute little coffee shop in the low B gates. Check it out if you need a fix."}
{"text":"Very personable service. The cashier John asked me if I am living my dream, which made me laugh. I said I was trying my best to, but that I was having a good day. He made suggestions for what I could get and was very accommodating letting me customize my sandwich. So, I got an egg and cheese sandwich with some avocado and a coffee with soy milk. They also serve wine and beer here. They're right by gate B10-B14. I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Great coffee, fabulous service thanks to Darius(not Rucker). Glad to have a non-Sbux option while waiting for a plane in Sky Harbor.  Who knew Terminal 4 would be the \"in\" place with Matt's Big Breakfast next door too."}
{"text":"My review is based on my boyfriend's first experience with this establishment and he absolutely loved this place; he literally could not stop talking about it.  He wasn't sure if this was a brother-and-sister operated business or if it was a happy little couple bringing good coffee and customer service to their clients but either way, he raved about the Americano drink he had and the warm and personable service he received.  My boyfriend doesn't give positive reviews or ratings for a lot of places - he prefers to complain.  So when he had a good memorable experience and asked that I give them a review on his behalf, I was happy to do it :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and  the coffee was good. I had a mocha frap and it had a peanut buttery taste to it but it was very good. Their comparable prices to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Woah! Im blown away about how nice, charming, friendly, and energetic these people are!!! You don't expect to get great service at the airport but these guys were amazing, the really set the tone for the rest of my day. Way to set an example! And my wrap was hot and delicious- coffee was ready quick and very good! Although the food could have been meh and I still would have been thrilled. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Have to say, the guys that work here are prob the nicest I have ever encountered! Especially in an airport!!! That really makes a difference, even more so when an airport can be so stressful! And even better, the panini was delicious!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service.  Maricela made the best cappuccino I have had in a wile.  JP has an infectious happy attitude.  Nice place to wait for your flight.  Absolutely would come back."}
{"text":"Darius clearly loves his job!   He greeted every customer with enthusiasm I haven't seen anywhere.  The food was good."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I've left a review for this place once before, but I have to leave a second. I have the pleasure of stopping for coffee and a One protein bar (love that they always have a selection of these yummy treats) whenever I fly out of Concourse B in Terminal 4 at PHX. This time I finally asked the cashier, \"Tell me who owns this place and about your management and training. I ask because every single time (yes every time!) the people behind the counter are smiling, very friendly, polite and ask about your day or your trip.\"  I quickly learned this place is family owned and they select employees based on personality fit, which includes energy and the oh so important friendly factor. They told me they believe they can teach you the skills (the Coffee machines, cash register,...), but only if you're a fit for their culture. I immediately got goose bumps!  For some of you, this may sound odd. But for those of you in Sales or the service industry, you likely understand what I'm talking about, right??  I'm so over spending money and walking away thinking, \"that person took my money and didn't say hello, thank you, or good bye\". Really??  Good customer service seems to be a thing of the past. But Refuge exudes excellent customer service. The people there, regardless of the day or who is working, always make me smile. I actually get excited when I see my flight is departing out of the first B concourse. Thanks for making my day, Refuge! You absolutely make me smile and I'm sure the same happens to the majority of folks you serve."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews, but had to here. Great customer service, not just from one person but everyone! Despite the business of the airport, truly impressed, good coffee, good food but stellar customer service which makes everything better. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Beer is cold and the snacks are delicious. The staff is cheerful and helpful. For airport snack places this was a fun stop."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I stopped here in the early morning after getting bumped from a flight the night before. I had gotten used to seeing stressed out and frustrated people. The crew here was friendly, professional and funny. Jessica made one of the best lattes I've ever had and; coming from Portland, Oregon; I know my lattes! She was energetic and upbeat. The line seemed long initially, but the service was very fast. I left with a smile on the face."}
{"text":"Really good food with really great service. What really sets this group of people apart is their friendly attitude.  Darius, ideally great and remembers my name ."}
{"text":"fantastic panini and glass of wine. fast, fantastic food. way way beyond normal airport food.  and darius was a great guy, super friendly, made me genuinely feel welcome. this place is a must if you are hungry and in phx terminal 4! thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Myself and the person behind me ordered cold brew.. the cashier shouts behind him the order and I wait.  20 mins later, the guy behind me and myself have to ask for it again because they lost both orders! Fix your system, shouting the order doesn't work clearly."}
{"text":"Short stop at the Phoenix Airport at 6.30 a.m which means a Latte for me :). I checked the options of the airport and The Refuge Coffee was the best one. The taste of the coffee is unique, in a good way, not the typical flat Starbucks taste. The guy who attended me was super nice!"}
{"text":"Stopped here today for a quick bite before my flight !! Super friendly staff and good place to grab a quick snack  before a flight !"}
{"text":"This place absolutely exceeded my expectation of a coffee shop at airports. The staff was amazing and friendly and the coffee was spectacular."}
{"text":"Fantastic service with big ol smiles. Jessica was sweet as pie, all had smiles, and the music was keeping me awake until I got my coffee. Very nice way to start the day."}
{"text":"Didn't expect this at an airport coffee shop but WOW!  excellent and friendly staff, delicious baked goods and coffee that is a pure delight - no room, simply black...awesome."}
{"text":"Okay, when do you EVER find an airport establishment that consistently gets 5 star reviews! Well, let me tell you it's well deserved! Friendly service, clean space, and friendly service....did I mention that already! It's worth saying twice. Oh so awesome peeps work here! The product is good as well. They deserve the impressive rating they have and should host a class for some of the other establishments near them."}
{"text":"Stopped for quick cappuccino. Marthalene and Maricela recommended lemon cake. Great cappuccino and awesome lemon cake. Thanks both for recommending and great service."}
{"text":"Great espresso, great service with smiles and friendliness! Highly recommend stopping here if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this place. I first came for the lattes - and they are great but soon found everything from salads to sandwiches to even their bottled beer selection were also great.  But the best part of my experience is the staff.  Though this is an airport location, they always give a personal touch to the weary traveler - a little bit of home while you are on the road."}
{"text":"Top notch customer service! I was blown away by the sincere and friendly demeanor of the associates here. On what had been a tough day for me, they made me smile."}
{"text":"Yup agree with all the other reviews they get a 5 stars for customer service alone! Maybe the team here can teach Matt's some lessons on being the bomb.com when it comes to kindness, enthusiasm and just plain awesomeness. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Mmmm hmmmm, I said it.   This is my place, my booooo when I am traveling via AA term B and need a good cup of brew. I actually prefer Refuge over the other popular coffee place, don't joke me you know where I am talking about. My Halfcaf americano is always good and def hits all the spots that need to be hit. No complaints there. I have actually not eaten here but from what I can see lots of folks that were eating were enjoying.   The team here is always always on point and they are so very personable. I would prob drink a cup of dirt just to stop by there to get my day jumping. No matter how early it is they are smiling, laughing and so very welcoming.  Thank you for making my 5:00 am start so fun today. Oh and they always have really good music playing.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Marcella, Mike and Marilee are exceptionally wonderful. Their cheerful, upbeat, warmest welcomes brightened each customer's day....at 6:45 AM. Early morning cranky scowls were turned into smiles after each of us in line was treated to a hearty \"good morning\".  Lucky all of us who chose \"The Refuge\" over other coffee/ tea establishments at Sky Harbor, Phoenix.  Their slogan is \"Our goal is to provide 5 star service\".  I'd easily bump that up to 10 stars!   Many thanks!"}
{"text":"I Find A \"Refuge\" At Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-refuge-coffee-and-wine-phoenix?select=00fryot8UB8NFWNtQAiLMw&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  SITREP  A 7-HR layover - at night - will kill ya considering that most places - eateries, munchie-stores, soda-stores, etc. - are pretty much shut down from 11pm to 6am inside an airport terminal.  THE SETUP    But Refuge Coffee & Wine isn't sleeping on the job:  it's open for breakfast right-at-the-crack-of-4AM!  And I pulled the trigger on their signature Refuge Breakfast Burrito, filled with everything you WANT in a breakfast burrito - eggs, cheese, bacon, sausage, other goodies, etc. - and even with it's own side of salsa to apply as you see fit! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-refuge-coffee-and-wine-phoenix?select=A4hK-Dw_cMtREbGYt12aGA&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  I was even in my gate area, working on the WiFi bar with laptop, waiting for my name to be called out, but Jessica just came across the aisle and brought me my burrito.  (God bless her!) https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-refuge-coffee-and-wine-phoenix?select=PZHg4Hmh69of_qVA59M6rw&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!  Let's get to the \"Coffee\" part - which is the first reason why I even approached this spot:  I got a deLISH mocha latte - smooth, creamy, not too sweet, yet leaving you wanting more of it's delightful nectar of the gods. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-refuge-coffee-and-wine-phoenix?select=YrpvoB7aY-9ynfp2lJkwJw&userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w  THE LOWDOWN  My hats off to the lovely ladies who make this operation so welcome and efficient here in B Terminal at Phoenix Sky Airport (PHX)."}
{"text":"Nobody in line, but still took over 10 minutes to make a cold coffee drink. Seemed like they totally forgot my order. Loud music and chatty service is great, but when you work at an airport you might think about doing things quickly. And right."}
{"text":"Kurt was so kind and friendly early this morning. He greeted me warmly and was super helpful. Fast service and good breakfast snack. Thanks for making it a great morning!"}
{"text":"Wow, seriously must be the best place to work. There is NOTHING that can get this group down. They are super friendly, fast and coffee is FANTASTIC! if you don't give this place 5 stars, something is wrong with you."}
{"text":"First let me say that I must have had an amazing experience because the link alone on the tiny business card that Jessica gave me to write a review was ridiculously small, and quite lengthy.  Ok, enough about me whining.  Let me tell you something.  I walked up super sleepy yet what greeted me was one of the brightest most amazing smiles I have ever seen.  Jessica greeted me with a good morning, how are you doing and what can I make for you.  The food was delicious yet the best part of the day was Jessica - just an amazing kind soul.  And the greatest part, she greeted all customers the same way.  Yes, she was the best part of my day.  The food was good - salsa was blah and tasted like out of a bottle.  Again, I think all could have been terrible yet due to an amazing employee whom seemed to care about all - it would not have mattered.  Plus I told her I would give a review, and well Jessica, thank you for being the best part of my morning and most of my day."}
{"text":"We had two micheladas and they were amazing!!! Great customer service the staff was so sweet and welcoming!!!"}
{"text":"Overall summary? A+. Customer service was so great and personable, and they definitely know how to make a killer coffee. I got a dirty spicy chai (I forgot the actual name, but it's a chai latte with espresso and cayenne, so wonderful!). The price is a little high but that's the airport for you. Still better than Starbucks in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! How nice to be flying out of the B gates! I've been here several times and I've always been greeted by happy smiling faces! Great energy here! Keep up the great work JQ and team!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and personalities!  Most food and coffee places at the airport are impersonal and unwelcoming. But the Refuge makes you feel at home even at 5:00 AM!  Best cranberry scone ever! Go out of your way in terminal 4, concourse B for coffee, wine and food!"}
