{"text":"This place is great.  Although it is now Rustic Lounge(new owners this summer).  It's got an authentic mountain lodge feel.  It's totally mellow.  We used to come here randomly for Very cheap pitchers($6) and pool, as it was always empty.  The new owners have re-felted the pool tables, and added a bunch of new TVs!  There's pool leagues and raffles, and drink specials!  It's technically a Broncos' bar so whenever the Doncos score a TD you get a free shot!  The staff is very friendly/attentive,  and easy on the eyes ;) If you don't want to spend a fortune, and you're not snooty, this is the place!"}
{"text":"One cute place. Amazing bartender. Good music. Cool hangout spot. Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Well it isn't magoos lodge anymore and honestly I don't know what anyone saw in this place if magoos was anything like this! Bar staff isn't very attentive I stood at the bar for a good ten minutes before they even asked if they could help me and there was maybe three people in the whole bar. I heard great things about the food but now that this place is the rustic lounge I guys they decided all that food want necessary cause there is no good in this establishment. It's dusty in here and even for a dive just a really crap place to be at any time of day. With all the killer options around here like legends and hammers if I were you I would just pass by this hole in the wall bummy crowd and really not anything as nice as it looks from the outside."}
{"text":"I met some of my friends here on a Tuesday night. The bartender was helpful and nice even when we didn't know what we wanted to drink. Price wise it's pretty reasonable. Magoo's no longer has karaoke here, but they do have a couple of pool tables. They also have slot machines around the bar. I noticed they also serve food, but never saw a menu.  Overall, if your looking for a local spot that is reasonably priced and has a friendly staff this place fits the bill!"}
{"text":"After a horrifying experience at another establishment on St. Patrick's day, a friend invited us to Magoos, to spend the rest of the evening with him and another group.   This was my first visit to Magoos, but I will absolutely be back.   Its open, spacious, and clean, with 2 pool tables and plenty of seating.    They had some killer St. Patty's day specials ($3 everything, basically: car bombs, Jameson shots, and cheap Guinness), and their standard drinks were reasonable too.  I had the best Bloody Mary I've had in about 3 years here for about $6.    Tom, the bartender, was amazing.   We're kind of an unruly group, and we got pretty loud and crazy, and he was polite, gracious, and took really good care of us.   Oh, also, the mac n cheese bites are to DIE for.  Highly recommended!!!  I will absolutely be back again, even though its a bit of a drive for me, the great service is 100% worth the drive."}
{"text":"Eh, 3 stars for them because the bartender ignored me for about an hour when i kept asking for water or any drink, and there was only 3 people in the entire place. Love the cabin feel inside , makes me fell like im camping lol other than that its a good place."}
