{"text":"Great place for a really fantastic unique dessert! Awesome place to take the kids to, especially on a nice day or night when walking around town."}
{"text":"Hands down everything I was hoping for plus more!! The dough is an awesome consistency with great flavor choices. When you pair the dough with the fresh ice cream and many options offered you'll surely find your new favorite treat!! We got the pleasure of meeting the owners who are such nice people, I mean I'd come back just to talk with them and see the smile on our kids faces again!! Thanks for a great experience and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"BEST COOKIE DOUGH EVER! The interior is soooo cute and there is a wide de variety of flavors, even catering to gluten free customers! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"It's good but it tastes more like variations of cookie flavored frosting than dough. I have a sweet tooth and 1 scoop is too much for me to finish in one sitting."}
{"text":"A really fun and unique place for a treat! The atmosphere is fun and the cookie dough is delicious! I loved the Nutella dough and I look forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"I was absolutely blown away by this gem in the heart of downtown Waxhaw. Now that downtown Waxhaw is boasting some serious foodie game in their restaurants, this makes the perfect dessert stop after dinner. You can walk here too!   The shop is really adorable and has seating inside. There are SOOO many flavors of cookie dough. No need to worry about getting sick. The ingredients are pasteurized so you will be fine.   If you feel intimidated like I did, you can always ask to sample the flavors before getting a scoop. My favorite flavor is cookie butter. My husband loved the snicker doodle. Of course, you can not go wrong with chocolate chip cookie dough. The cookie dough tastes just like homemade cookie dough. Prices are very reasonable at just $4 for one scoop, $6 for two scoops, and $8 for three scoops. I will say that the scoops are very generous.   Make sure to check out this great local business. I love this concept. Its definitely refreshing instead of the run of the mill frozen yogurt shops around."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. Everything looked clean and it is a creative idea. However, the cookie dough is overpowering. It was way too sweet, and I could only eat a few bites. They messed up two orders of the five in my party. Will not be surprised if it doesn't last long."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to Waxhaw! Adorable location and incredible staff- cookie dough is really good!! Highly recommend!!!!"}
