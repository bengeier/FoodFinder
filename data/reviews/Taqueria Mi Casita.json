{"text":"If you didn't grow up eating mexican food everyday of your life ( homecooked ), you will not appreciate the true taste of this food. All of the lower restaurant chains like Filibertos, Amados,etc. and super \"authentic\" and \"true\" mexican food locations that costs $60 for 2 people is NOT mexican food lol. If you don't like Mi Casita, then this place just isn't for you and you don't know true, traditional home-cooked flavor. I always order something different when I go because nothing fails here. My favorite so far is a carne asada y buche burrito fully blown with their pico de gallo, red salsa, guacamole, cilantro, with the sides of their grilled serranos and onions washed down with a mexican coke! #1 spot for me here in Chandler area, in Tucson, Guero Canelo's is a must as they are the best in AZ. BUT, both are nowhere near King Taco in LA"}
{"text":"Great tasting street tacos & burritos.  They're very generous with their portions.  Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Chandler lucks out with another great burrito place! Burritos are made right in front of you, and you can put whatever you want on them! When I go for lunch, the cooks always seem to be in a great mood and are not afraid to joke around for the short time I'm in the restaurant, it's great."}
{"text":"Only thing here worth stopping by for was the flan. Runny salsa and beans, old chips and missing ingredients."}
{"text":"if it was possible to give them a higher rating, i would, their unbelievable FRIENDLY, and the food is AMAZING!!!! keep up the good work guys!!!!(:"}
{"text":"Why there isn't a line out the door for the carnitas here I don't know. Maybe those in the know are just keeping it their little secret.   Well, I'm glad I figured it out because it's the most delicious carnitas I've ever had. It's almost a succulent pork stew, really - lots of shredded pork in a rich, flavorful gravy. I had it first on a taco, but now I get it as a \"meat only\" burrito with just onion, cilantro and red salsa. Pretty much pure burrito nirvana, cannot recommend it enough.  Other things I've had here are very good also, but it's the carnitas that will keep me coming back week after week.   And to top everything off, all the guys who work here are sincerely nice, friendly and always in a good mood. Which makes it all the more enjoyable.   Thank you Taqueria Mi Casita!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall that is a diamond in the rough. Last night we had a chicken burrito, beef burrito, and beef tostada with a drink for under $20. The service was quick, the staff was friendly (and a little sarcastic), and everything we ate couldn't have been better.  If you're looking for great Mexican food, go here. I will be returning and bringing anyone who visits me here as well!"}
{"text":"Another great yelp discovery!   Stopped by for lunch on a weekday in the end of August with family in tow from out of town and all starving. Cozy small shop. Ours was take-out. Busy there, but not so busy as to cause a wait for food as the prep was most efficient. Very personable and accommodating gentleman taking orders and preparing food in view tailored to the customer's liking.  Delicious breakfast burrito made just like one of our party requested. Enormous! Carne asada burrito with tasty, tender steak done right, too. Again, enormous! Ask and ye shall receive as far as most ingredients go. Cilantro, onions, mayo, etc., just say yes or no.  And did I mention \"enormous\"?  You'll definitely receive your money's worth for well-prepared, fresh, delicious food.  Will be back for sure and highly recommended to all."}
{"text":"So amazing!  This is the best taqueria I have found in the area by far. While waiting in line the guy taking our order had us laughing and made us feel at home.  The food was great. I had a al pastor burrito and it was so flavorful. I liked that it wasn't loaded with pineapple like other places sometimes have. The tortillas seemed like they were homemade or very fresh and great quality.  I will definitely be back for the carne asada and carnitas... And of course more al pastor!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It's a small little restaurant that has room for some inside seating but not a lot. The staff is really friendly and talkative. I don't recommend the tacos al pastor, the meat is soggy  and a little on the greasy side which I've never seen before. The carne asada tacos are really good though."}
{"text":"Burrito here is huge and awesome. There is always a line when I go for lunch. Also a lot of Mexicans come here which is a good sign. I get a mix of carnitas and asada and then everything inside pico, cheese, lettuce, guac, sour cream etc. The tortilla is fresh and warmed up on the grill.   I have been twice and will continue to go and get same thing because it is so good- even though I always see people in front of me ordering plates and tacos which also look very good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Good food, authentic Mexican. The food taste great and is always a go to for real Mexican food. If you like that Mexican American food mix, this is not that."}
{"text":"This place is great -- authentic, delicious --- the real deal. I just had lunch there and I am thinking of going back for dinner. Very casual environment and very friendly staff. I live in Michigan and this was my first stop after I got off the plane. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great value. Try pork tostada & tacos. Huge borritos.  Roasted jallapeno Mui bueno."}
{"text":"Was raised on mexican food. So with that being said, I have very high standards when it comes to mexican food.  I ordered a carne asada burrito. The meat was very bland and a bit mushy. They used cheddar cheese instead of Mexican white cheese, also the rice was over cooked and the tortilla was cooked to long so it was hard. Was really disappointed because it has a very authentic mexican feel when you walk in. My wife had the carne asada tacos and she was not satisfied with the flavor also. On a scale from 1-10 it gets a 5. Will not be going back to this place:-("}
{"text":"Tacos and Flan! And you don't have to order a \"taco plate\" not a huge fan of paying for stuff when I don't want it. Great place to go when you just want a couple tacos, great prices. Always friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Usually get some street tacos before going out on a Friday or Saturday. The Carne asada burrito is literally the best I've had"}
{"text":"Hell Yeah, Real Tacos!  If you have ever heard somebody talk about \"Real Tacos\" this is what they mean.  I cannot say what exactly qualifies as a real taco, but there are subtle differences from a real taco & the kind you find at most Americanized/Taco Bell type places. First of all, you know you're at a real taco place when you walk in & the place is full of landscapers having lunch.  Next, the tortillas were small and doubled-up.  Then the selection of meats was really authentic: buche (beef neck meat), cabeza (beef cheeks), lengua (beef tongue), al pastor (marinated pork), carnitas (braised pork),and  finally the carne asada was actually flame cooked, not cooked on a flat grill.  The tacos are then topped with cilantro & onions.  I tried one of each kind of taco and they were all greasy and full of flavor.  This was my first time there.  I plan to go back and try the tortas and maybe even the burritos because those looked really tasty.  Oh, the icing on the cake was the price... $1.25/taco.  That's keeping it real."}
{"text":"I was brought here and have loved them from the beginning. This little hole in the wall has the nicest staff and some of the best tacos I've tried. If you're looking for some amazing, tasty and satisfying tacos for an awesome price, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to Mexican \"hole in the wall\" joints when I want something other than \"Filiberto's\". Food is good, the menu could improve. I'm just not into these super authentic places with the pictures of the food on the menu. I think they might think they're a little better then they really are, but not bad."}
{"text":"Very tasty!! Steak burrito and steak tacos were awesome and staff was very friendly! Will be back! Could be the best in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that I came across this gem! My friend and I were driving over for some bubble tea at Lollicup and decided to get some dinner beforehand. The place is very authentic, and the guys behind the counter are awesome. They were very friendly, and after coming in a few times, we were greeted as \"amigos!\" and they always wanted to know what we were up to.   The food here is great. You pick what ever food item(s) you want off the menu at the counter up front, and take your tray over to the adjacent seating area. The menu is very large and authentic. I personally enjoy getting a chicken burrito. The burrito is huge, definitely over 2 times the size of a burrito at Chipotle. They also don't fill it with rice and beans to cover the lack of meat that Chipotle gets away with. The guys here fill the burrito to the breaking point with all the goodies. I would also recommend getting either chicken, beef, or spicy pork tacos. They are authentic flat tacos with onion, cilantro, pico de gallo and whatever else you want on them. They have a fountain for beverages, but they have Mexican Coca Cola with real sugar (my favorite) and bottled water in a fridge in the back. The chips they serve are great. You can get red or green salsa to accompany your chips, along with radishes and limes. They have fresh roasted jalapenos that are amazing with anything.  To address Krashawnda N's concerns. The chicken quality is perfect. You may not like dark meat, but I personally find no issues with the chicken. It is grilled and seasoned and tastes delicious. As for your \"Bizarre Foods\" comment... I guess you've never been to a Middle Eastern restaurant before, or know what Shawarma is. What you saw was most likely Al pastor, which is Shawarma adopted from Lebanese immigrants in Mexico. I have never seen them serving it, but I do see  the bare machine in the window by the grill each time I go in.  In conclusion, this place is awesome. I believe is is open to 11pm throughout the week which is 2x as awesome. If you are in the area, and are craving Mexican food, it is definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, and I've never been disappointed. The food is great, people are friendly and the place is always clean. You have to try the breakfast burrito. It is really good and enough food for two. Also tried the menudo; I am not a big fan of the red menudo, but I can eat this one."}
{"text":"Terrible. I walked in and they guy behind the counter tells me he needs 3 minutes. I'm in at an odd time (3:00 PM) and see he is working hard to clean the grill. 18 minutes later, I place a to go order. Included was a veggie burrito wet with red & green sauce, with rice & beans on the side. He must have misunderstood because I get home to a tortilla with lettuce, cheese, cilantro and onion. How have I lived so long without this creation? Uh yeah, because it is AWFUL. Rice had NO flavor, beans were tge runniest I've ever had. I usually avoid meat, but something was telling me to add on to my order. I was curious how the fish taco was. Um microwaved to heat up and ALL BREADING, equally as terrible as everything else I tried. Didn't have more than a second bite. Chicken taco was totally bland and dry. I had to order \"Grandma's recipe flan\" 3 different times and it still got left out of my order. Ordered & paid for separately, it was the best part of my meal (which had been comprised of 6 bites of various yuck). Maybe it is an approach to flan I wasn't used to. Not particularly coukd although it came from the cooler and the texture was sort of mealy and not a bit creamy...  What a waste of $13.00...."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic food, fast & friendly service.  The place was packed on Saturday night...very busy.  Will definitely be back again.  Yummiest tacos!!"}
{"text":"Worst carne asada burrito that I ever tasted ,I've tasted frozen burritos that tasted better . waste of money and toilet paper instant runs very disgusting ,meat was chewy with lots of fat horrible don't waste ur time or money on this junk."}
{"text":"I came in here i think i was last Monday and god are these employees a pare of happy campers! The guy that makes the burritos sort of rolled his eyes a bit on me but happy overall, the other tall young man who says his name is George i think or Jorge if that's how you spell it in English was as friendly as he could be! It was almost as if he was reading my mind when i needed something he was there! He introduced himself and even told me a bit about what was the best item on their menu and i'm loving it! The food was top class, top notch, #1 you name it! But definitely going back there just to be treated right by that young man Jorge hes REALLY nice and his service is PERFECT! It be a +4 from me if Jorge wasn't there to provide his service so +5!"}
{"text":"It was the best darn burrito I have ever had!  The flavors were soooo tasty.  Fun place and sure nice staff.  Enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"So we have passed by this place many times.  I've been into the Ace Hardware right next to it several times.  Don't know how we have never seen this place.  Fortunately we searched yelp for something new and gave it a shot.  The street tacos are awesome.  Looks like I'll have to go back for a carne asada burrito, but based on the size I saw (and what I've read), it's gonna have to be a one item meal!  They're huge!  I tried the street tacos to sample a few things...carnitas, pollo and pescado.  All excellent.  I would have to lean to the carnitas though.  Definately going back!  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is there was a kid sweeping and mopping the floor and we were having to get out of his was several times.  Just kinda rubbed me wrong. And while I loved the music, it was a bit loud and I don't know how much it was there for the ambience, the customers, or the staff.   Everything else about the staff was great.  Friendly and positive.  Mabe my next trip will kick it up to 5....."}
{"text":"Hands down... THE BEST! I always get a carne asada burrito. The portions are fantastic. Prices are cheap! Rice and beans are delicious; you can't go wrong! I love this place. I am never let down."}
{"text":"We ate there today because we had an Entertainment Book coupon.  Would never have even seen the place otherwise.  The only negative is that it was hot inside, but that was OK, since it was a beautiful day and we ate outside.  One of the employees asked me if we had been there before, since I'm sure we don't look like regulars.  I had the fish burrito and my husband had the chicken burrito.  Definitely plenty of food.  They gave us complimentary chips and told us to ask if we wanted any more.  One of the employees came outside to see how we liked everything.  The quality of the food at such a reasonable price is something we will remember."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos and breakfast burritos!! The carne asada meat was a little dry but nothing their salsa couldn't fix. Overall, we had a great tasting and cheap meal! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So the people that classify this as good are the same people that frequent Fili'b's and all of the other laughable places that I wouldn't get caught serving to my dog. Seriously, people, you can cook something so much better for less.  Anyway, I've been a patron here for years, and unfortunately it seems like some of the staff has left and there are new people working there. They don't have nearly the same attention to detail that they used to. Just today, the carnitas looked black, overcooked and disgusting, the al pastor was trimmed poorly and had huge chunks of gristle, the chicken that I had had a nice little bone it it, the jalapenos which were once amazing fresh grilled local jalapenos were disgusting goopy messes that I later puked up.  I really miss this place from a few years ago. The shaved headed guy that called everyone \"my friend\" was awesome. Their Al pastor was just insane. Too bad."}
{"text":"I moved here from Laredo, TX which borders Mexico...Nuevo Laredo and yes I am Mexican.  When I moved here I was very depressed when I found out that Arizonan's thought that fajita's were nothing but sirloin steak with peppers and onions added.  True fajita meat is made from the skirt cut of the cow.    That being said, Mi Casita doesn't off fajitas but I have now been going there over 11 years once a week, and this is the most authentic taco shop that I have found in the east valley!  The staff is fun friendly and dang their good rocks!  I stand by it 100%, before going here when my wife would ask to go out for Mexican food, I would give her a shopping list and say, \"no way I will make it :-)\"  Now this place has good rice not the best, as personally I am biased and think mine is better than any Mexican place I have tried here in AZ.  I would recommend if you are looking to have some great carne asada tacos or a burrito that is just ridiculously huge this is the place to go. Snip it from wiki pedia about carne asada, \"In Mexican cuisine, carne asada (literally 'grilled meat' (specifically beef), though any type of dry heat cooking may be used)[1] is made from thin marinated beef steak, usually skirt steak, flank steak or flap steak.\"  so the above are the variety of meats that can be used.  Skirt is more expensive here so most of the local taco shops will use the flank steak, but if done right and they do it right is excellent!  Please try this place out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. I love their chicken tacos and my husband gets the chorizo tacos. Their prices are great and they are also very friendly. I would never have tried this place just by driving by because it's kind of hidden amongst other stores, but my husband's work sometimes buys their food for parties etc.. and so he told me I had to try them. I was pleasantly surprised :-) Delicious!"}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious. Tried the Carne Asad, bbq pork, and chorizo. Came with onion and cilantro topping and a house made choice of mild or hot salsa."}
{"text":"I've been here twice this week since I've found out about the place and I'm probably gonna go again today.   It's right down the street from me and its exactly what I've been looking for. Fresh, tasty, bad for the body and damn cheap.   I'm sure lunch hour is terrible but I've always been there in the mornings.   Carne asada burrito dressed however you want and the carnitas tacos are both bomb as hell."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices and wonderful people whom I believe own the place :) shared pollo nachos, tostada, the hubby had pollo, asada and pastor tacos and my friend had chicken enchiladas. All YUMMY! The burritos looked amazing! Cannot wait to try everything else"}
{"text":"I ordered  5 breakfast burritos on Saturday at 8am when they opened. When I got they there they were already busy. This place is small but excellent I t service and food. I loved the breakfast burrito it was very big and ingredients fresh and full of flavor.   The prices are very good I can't wait to try the tacos.."}
{"text":"Oh dang! This place is GOOD. I am in love with the carnitas burrito, and the employees are so nice and make some damn good food. If you're in the area and don't want Taco Bell then GO HERE! They also give you chips, and the chips and salsa are pretty legit. Try not to stuff yourself with the chips though, cause the foods the real winner here. I will be back, and have been back many many times since my first experience. Why only 4 stars you ask? The breakfast burrito was just a-okay, I would much rather get a breakfast burrito elsewhere but the regular burritos are the bomb diggity! ;)"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I found this place whilst driving around last night, hungry enough to be a little snappish but not so hungry that we just said 'screw it' and made a beeline to the closest (and only okay) tacqueria to our house.  Before even getting to the food, I have to say this place earns five stars for the customer service.  No sexy taco girls were working last night (though I did see the family photo on the wall and say Damn!), but as we walked in the door we were welcomed with exuberant hellos and Happy New Years! greetings.  They were really, REALLY happy to see us, or they put on a really convincing show of it.  The cook came from the back to say hi and tell us what's good (everything- I don't think he was lying), the guy in front was excited to tell us about the family that owned the place and the type of food they serve.  They demanded we take some chips and salsa on the house and I'm glad they did- the tortilla chips were freshly fried with that lovely salty, greasy taste without the texture being greasy.  The tortilla equivalent of the best kettle chips.  We left feeling giddy and happy and really fricken excited to get home and eat. Now, the actual food.  We each got a burrito and the boyfriend also got a cheese quesadilla.  Along with the complimentary chips, this was a ridiculous amount of food.  The burrito-forearm comparison doesn't really give these burritos justice.  If my forearm were that size, and I were a guy... well, there's no doubt what I spent all my time doing (possibly thinking about these taco girls?).  The guy asks you what you want on it and wraps the burrito in front of you- I was amazed he could actually close up the burrito!  Also, I'm happy to report that despite the size this is the first place in the valley I've found that wraps their burritos tight enough that they stay erect (what's up with the sex innuendo in this post?) and don't fall apart mid-scarf.  My only complaint is that they were so big and loaded it's hard to tell what type it's supposed to be.  I ordered fish with the knowledge that I wanted to taste fish, cabbage, lime juice, sauce, and a little whatever to fill the sucker out.  Instead I got a kitchen sink concoction that tasted delicious but not really any different from the boyfriend's carne asada burrito.  If I went back I'd probably get some tacos or their delicious, grilled, non-greasy quesadillas.  (Unless I'm starving and just want an ambiguous metric ton of deliciousness.)  I'm actually really excited to go back to try their tacos as the taste of the quesadilla transported me straight to dreamy, drunk nights in Mexico.  Mmmm grill flavor. The prices were slightly higher than other places I've been- maybe a buck more per burrito, but it's definitely made up for in quantity, taste, structural integrity of the burrito, and customer service.  I will definitely drive the extra distance and pay the extra dollar when I need a Mexican fast-food fix."}
{"text":"This is the third taco stop in my recent taco binge. I was greatly disappointed due to the reviews, but then again, reviewers here are either greatly kind or have no taste buds. I only had the carne asada and the marinated pork. The carne asada was fried  and bland and on top of that was sitting in a container under a light, not freshly made. The pork was dried and again not marinated but just bland. The kicker was the salsa was bland also. I ordered the pineapple drink, which was just like cool-aide, no real pineapple like they have at food city. This place is similar to a place I tried when I first arrived to Arizona 5 years ago and only recently started eating tacos again. After this, I might have to rethink my sabbatical from taco shops and restaurants."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food offering ingredients like tongue and cabeza that you don't find in most places. Good spice from the food and management."}
{"text":"If you want great authentic Mexican food - go there!!!! Don't even think about any other place. The food is great, portions generous and athmosphere great!!!! Make sure to put salsa rojo on your tacos- so damn flavorful and my lips are still tingling!!!!"}
{"text":"Went Here Today.... Food Was Bomb!!!Great Mexican Style Tacos... Burros Were The Bussiness And Service Was Awesome... If You Order Nachos Ask For The Chips On The Side Or As A Side Cuz Together They Wont Work... The Chips Will End Soggy. Good But Soggy...."}
{"text":"Essentially this is the best of a lil' Mexican food cart placed inside a building. Seeing that it is on the same corner as a Taco Bell amuses me. Look at the reviews of this place. It really is that good. The owner is also very friendly. The carnitas and cabeza are definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Taqueria Mi Casita has authentic Mexican food I just wasn't impressed by the food. I tried an Al Pastor burrito. Nothing was flavorful enough from the Al Pastor to the salsa to the beans. The refried beans and hot salsa were very watery. There is no salsa bar in the restaurant. Authentic? Yes. Good? Not so much. There are much better authentic Mexican places in the Phoenix area. Transplant this restaurant to an area of the country with poor unauthentic Mexican food and this would be the best place in town. Here in the Phoenix area? Not so much."}
{"text":"Awesome food. They are very authentic Mexican food. I've had their tacos and burritos and they are flavorful and you add what you want to the burrito.even the kitchen sink if they could. The last review about them skimping on the meat. Seriously they don't. On the tacos just have them cook corn tortilla on their skillet for a while otherwise you have a soggy tortilla.ive seen their quesadillas and tortas and I'll be trying those soon. I've asked a few customers in Saturdays and Sundays if they like the menudo they are eating and haven't heard one bad complaint. Seriously this is the new spot. No more driving to phx for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Excellent, we live be about a mile away and what a great treat to be so close to the best, authentic taco shop in the valley. Great food, great prices!"}
{"text":"We come here often and it's amazing! Love the al pastor. Clean friendly fast. One of those great hole in the wall places that you can't pass up! Very authentic and great quality !"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, I had carne asada and pastor. Highly recommend the pastor! The rice was pretty good and both salsas were excellent."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Just like the places back home in San Fernando valley in Cali. My husband and I have yet to find a taco truck around here with authentic tacos, we just found it. These tacos are as real as they get! And the breakfast burrito is huge! It was finger lickin good. The people here are very nice and very welcoming. It's clean, nice, and cozy. We just found a go to spot. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place since it's right by my house.  I have been to backyard taco and I thought this would be similar.  I wasn't impressed.  The staff was very nice!! The carne asada just seemed to lack flavor.. maybe I shouldn't have came 30 minutes before close.  Anyways, my suggestion would to try backyard taco. THE BEST tacos around :)"}
{"text":"Continuing on my eternal quest for the ultimate taco/burrito shop I had the pleasure of trying Taqueria Mi Casita today.  This morning's adventure placed me in the middle of the intersection of Alma School and Warner as Google Maps announced that I had arrived at my destination.  Hmmmm, which corner?  My second try found me in the right strip mall (NW corner).    Immediately when I entered, I was greeted by a loud, very friendly man who welcomed me to my first visit.  My order was a breakfast burrito and two bean and cheese burritos to go.  My breakfast burrito continued to grow until it was ultimately filled (stuffed) with egg, bacon, beans, chorizo.  See photos.  As my order was being filled, the customers continued to arrive.  My breakfast burrito was one of the best except for one thing, store bought tortillas.  I never realized what a difference, \"genuine\" tortillas makes.  This was a fun experience and I no doubt will be back, I just wish they would change tortillas.    Oh, and apparently the taco vixens were not working this early as I didn't see them either.  Perhaps they are like mermaids and only appear in the minds of the lost, starving or those ship wrecked in the desert."}
{"text":"First visit, the carnitas torta is amazing! It was gigantic.  The other 2 guests I was with had the lingua tacos and they said it was awesome.  If you expect great food you won't be disappointed.  If you're expecting ambiance you'll be let down.  It's definitely a small joint. While we were there it became packed.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"The people working here are very nice. They always have a big line, and they manage to keep their cool.. which is very very important in the restaurant business. The tortas are ok, but I wouldn't say the food in this place is  100% authentic Mexican, however their tortas and burritos are ok. Their asada meat is very greasy too."}
{"text":"Located in a nondescript strip mall, I have been here a few times. There was really nothing too exciting about either the tacos I have ordered or the nachos I had the other day.   I find their menu to be very limited.    I find Filibertos, Los Favoritos, and the many other Mexican restaurants in Chandler to be better."}
{"text":"Burritos were excellent! Menu is a bit confusing at first.....but you basically just pick what you want to go in it.  I will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"Mark J. took me here once and swore it was the best Mexican place ever. However I was not really impressed with the food. It was like a B+, maybe. Then again, I didn't get to see the supposedly smoking hot taco vixen who works here. Perhaps next time I will get to stare into her eyes and forget what I ordered too.  For now I will just have the memory of my soggy burrito (my fault for waiting an hour to eat it) and the random zuccini they put in it, which was pretty gross. I think that this place could be pretty good and I just had an off experience. The dudes who work here were REALLY nice so I would like to go back for a second chance.  Who wants to take me here next?"}
{"text":"Love this place, I'm here every week. Delicious carne asada tacos! I like coming here for a quick lunch or for a post-workout meal. You wait in line as they prepare your meal and once it's ready you pay.  If you've never been to a taquiera, I highly suggest you check this place out to try some of these fun, cultured dishes!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best bean/rice/cheese burritos as well as the carne Asada burrito. I love how you can visually pick and choose what goes on your burrito."}
{"text":"The guys were really nice and the service was prompt. But it was super hot and muggy in there like so bad it was cooler outside in the 116 degree heat! I had the carne asada tacos. The meat was warm but taste like day old meat. It was old meat heated up probably sitting there all day and it was salty. I'm by no means a picky eater but this first experience here will not have me coming back for the food and the heat stroke you'll get sitting inside. They have great customer service, but I did not like the food at all."}
{"text":"Food tasted really good. If u want it prepared a certain way (ie lots of cheese, lots of pico, and no beans) stay upfront when they are making it and watch it being made. No frills location in strip mall"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!!! Me and my husband loved it! We WILL be back! Definitely worth going there... don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Great tasting burritos and tacos. Authentic Mexican food and fresh ingredients and generous size burrito that would put Chipotle burritos to shame in size and taste. Fantastic food at great prices."}
{"text":"The best hole in the wall Mexican restaurant in the valley! The best burritos AND tacos! We drive from east Gilbert(Power and Ray) just to eat here--we just keep coming back for more. Absolutely delicious! So glad we found this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a tiny restaurant so it's best for a group of 3 or less people. I get the carne asada burrito bañado with enchilada sauce on the burrito and extra red sauce on the side. It's so delicious and you can't beat the price. Good quality and quantity of food. The menudo is out of this world delicious! The breakfast burritos are so large and so yummy. Hands down my favorite place to go to when I'm craving Mexican food. The tacos are delicious and the flan. Definitely go here and eat their food. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"This place did not amaze me, I grew up eating Mexican food on Mission street in San Francisco so that may be where my bias comes from. I got a carnitas burrito, large drink and a carne asada quesadila and it came out to around $15. The quality of the meat was OK but the \"guacamole\" was a light green soup. This was a major turn off because the fat in real avocados blends with the saltiness of the meat to create a nice balance in most Mexican dishes. I would not recommend this place to anyone, while not terrible it is certainly not amazing."}
{"text":"Best street tacos in the Valley!  We find ourselves at this little hole-in-the wall at least once a week - more when my husband is craving their breakfast burrito on Sunday mornings.    My favorite is the carne asada with just cilantro and onion with their delicious red sauce.  Hubby goes for the chorizo and chicken tacos.  Everyone we take there is immediately hooked.  Even better?  Every employee is friendly, helpful and so welcoming.  You feel like you just showed up in their backyard and they are your new friends."}
{"text":"Great food quality and quantity. Although TMC is a small setup, I was very impressed during my visit to Phoenix and the surrounding area. Stopped by here through a colleague recommendation, and I would pass on the sentiment. The quesadilla is about $6-7, cooked to perfection, and comes with a side of rice, beans, and tostada chips. I also had a few tacos al pastor on the side ($1.50/each), and they definitely pack it with food and fillings.  Additionally, the staff is friendly, fast, and love to speak in Spanish. A great find that reminded me of home.  Hope to visit again during my next trip!"}
{"text":"I love the food but hate the wait sometimes. I love the tacos de cabeza and my husband loves the carne asada burrito. Not a great fan of their adobada though."}
{"text":"What's the best place in the neighborhood if you want a burrito or some street tacos? The answer depends on what time it is. If it happens to be before 11PM, it's Taqueria Mi Casita - they just changed their hours as they used to close at 10PM most days. If you missed that window, there's still Los Favoritos on Chandler and Dobson, NE corner. And if you missed that window, you're stuck with 24/7 places like Filiberto's or Amado's. I like this place because you can see them make your burrito or tacos to order right in front of you. I tried most of their meats but I'm partial to their carnitas - it's tastier than their carne asada. You can add as much as you want of condiments and extras and they don't nickle and dime you for sour cream or guacamole like a lot of other places do. The guys there always greet me with \"hey friend\" and that's cool with me. Prices are pretty cheap and you definitely get some value - your buck does some banging! I sometimes also get their \"Grandmother's Flan\" if I'm craving some flan - there's is about as good as anyone else's. Used to come here for lunch a lot but I guess word got out and they always seem to be busy - there's not a whole lot of seating there. Lots of parking - Same mall as Tao Garden, Tokyo House, and Video Paradise."}
{"text":"Once again, GREAT breakfast. Service was very good and restaurant is super clean!!! Love this place."}
{"text":"Everything here it's good.  Best chorizo I've ever had. Nachos,burritos, breakfast burritos,  tacos,"}
{"text":"Just found this place, and I really love it, it feels like we are in Mexico. The chef was very generous with the meat. It was like aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh Yeah!!"}
{"text":"Sorry to not be able to give the 5 stars that lured me here, but the carne asada burrito, while tasty in flavor, was riddled with fat. Can't stand having to spit out fat while trying to enjoy the food I paid for."}
{"text":"We love it . Has the best food for the Buck !! Love their oversized burritos and menudo on Saturday and Sundays :-)"}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos are to die for! So good! You can't go wrong with their carne asada burritos/tacos!"}
{"text":"Very good, authentic Mexican. Everything is good, but the street tacos and burritos are tops. I wish I lived closer but I love that they are open until 11pm."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp.  Excellent quality  and such a deal they have home made tortillas   Be prepared to stand in line  as they cook to order all fresh and delicious and the restaurant was very clean No servers etc  it's a hole in the wall place but they obviously know what they are doing  the place was packed @ 11 am.  We will definitely return on our next visit to Mesa."}
{"text":"THE best Mexican food I've had since moving to Arizona from so-cal!!! Being from the Los Angeles area there's nothing but delicious Mexican food and moving  to Chandler was one of the most depressing things because there's noting but chain restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this place. I knew it was going to be good when you see a long line! I wish a had a picture of my food but that was the last thing on my mind when I got the baby home ( Carne Asada búrado)$6.99. I recommend to anybody who wants a great meal for not a lot of money."}
{"text":"Best I've had since moving to Arizona I am.use to.the San diego mexican food so out here it's hard to.find a good.place and this one is amazing."}
{"text":"I love taquerias but never thought Ide be giving one five stars, this place deserves it! Quality food, great portions but the great service is exceptional! So glad I found this little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I happened to be in Phoenix so I decided to check this place out. The staff was very friendly and attentive and the food was decent. Reasonable prices, too. I would certainly come back again."}
{"text":"A secret you begrudgingly share...that's what this is.  A work buddy recommended this place after attending a catered event. The restaurant is small, it's a mom&pop restaurant.  That's a plus. The food is amazing.  I've tried various burritos (carne asada, el pastor, chorizo) and they were all very tasty.  The salsa rojo is spicy, so ...you were warned. The street tacos are as good as any I've had.  I've been over a dozen times and there's still menu items to explore.  Again, it's with caution that I share my thoughts on this place...I fear the lines that I may see here someday."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Had carne, al pastor, and fish tacos. Others had a burrito, combo plates. Real deal mexican in a tiny little strip mall shop. Great prices, large portions, open late. Go here."}
{"text":"Such a good choice. This was one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had. It's definitely a hole in the wall place, but the line from the time we walked in was a clue that the food would be good. Not only was there a line it got longer as we ate our breakfast. If the food being great wasn't enough the employees were extremely pleasant. They worked like a well oiled machine."}
{"text":"I wanted so bad to give this place 5 stars, but I just can't, and for one reason: the store bought tortillas.  There are a few things I look for in my Mexican food establishments.  The meat is actually seasoned and flavorful (something two chain operations out here really miss the mark on), the selection of meats offered (let's face it, if lengua, cabeza, pastor, etc are on the menu, you definitely aren't at Fili B's), and I am a sucker for street tacos.  This place hits all three on the head!!  When I read the other reviews I kept noticing yelpers were mentioning the store bought tortillas and I didn't think it was such a big deal...  But it was barely even warmed up!  My burrito felt cold in my hands.  In the future I will probably skip burritos and order a carnitas plate.  The street tacos were probably made with store bought tortillas as well, but they were so yummy and at the perfect temperature, I really can't complain.  Oh, and the two guys on shift when I visited were both very warm and friendly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. If you're looking for some honest Mexican food, that's not filibertos or a lame sit down Mexican restaurant this is the spot! The people working are super friendly and welcoming. I go with 'al pastor' (BBQ pork) whether its in a burrito or tacos. Boom!"}
{"text":"We normally go to Amados because it's right down the road but tonight we wanted something cheaper. We found Taqueria Mi Casita on yelp and saw their veggie burrito was only $5.05 and couldn't say no to the price. Wow. We are so happy we went! My husband got two veggie burritos to go and not only were they huge, they were fresh, delicious, and full of flavor! We were expecting a big roll of mush inside but that was not the case. Caramelized onions, cilantro, crispy lettuce, and guacamole set this burrito apart! With tax it was $10.89 and worth every penny. If we weren't so hungry we could have saved some for the next day. Skip your go to Mexican food restaurant and come to Taqueria Mi Casita instead! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The BEST mexican food in town!! Very friendly staff, food made quickly right in front of you and tastes delicious! Lots of menu options and great prices!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place got 5 stars, we stopped by hoping to find authentic mexican food which on the outside looking in it looked promising. We order two carne asada tacos and a carne asada burrito long story short the meat was over cooked and was full of tough chewy gristle chunks, beans and rice on burrito had no flavor,  I would say this place will not be on my do over list :("}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious! Also the price is great! I think these guys should seriously look into expanding their business by increasing the number of their locations. The quality and taste of the food beats chipotle by a mile! Soooo good :)"}
{"text":"Since I took my order to go one of the primary things I look for in my food is how hot is it by the time I get back to work. It was so hot I had to wait another 5-10 minutes before I could take a bite.  For me this was a good thing since I did not want to eat a cool burrito.  Once I was able to devour it I was happy to discover how good it was.  The only sad part of my breakfast burito was the siesta was forced to take.  The service was great, food was great overall a great experience"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good!  For years I've been searching for good mexican food in the valley and haven't had much luck.  I've lived in other places where the mexican food is way better.  Sadly, moving to Phoenix made me yearn for the good mexican food in Texas  Perhaps it's the Tex-mex style of cooking that I miss, but in general, the food here just doesn't taste as \"authentic\".  Taqueria Mi Casita is by far the best Mexican food place I've been to in the East Valley.  The food is made to order, which is nice.  Also, the prices are reasonable and everything tastes authentic. I knew it was a good sign when the line was literally out the door when I pulled up to the restaurant.  I'm so glad I found a good taco spot to go to!"}
{"text":"The best tacos, not only in Chandler but in Arizona. The burritos and torta's are also amazing. The place is small but dynamite. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I've found most taquerias to be good. They tend to be Mom 'n Pop operations and have a family recipe, while some others are hit or miss.  But Taqueria mi Casita is great!  If you know Chandler, Elmer's is one of the best fast Mexican places. And that's where I was heading, until construction on Chandler Blvd forced me up Alma School. Hey, it's Taco Tues, right?   But I went too far up on Alma and hit Warner, and in front of me was Taco Bell. Ugh. Friends don't let friends eat at Toxic Hell I thought.   So while making a u-turn in their parking lot and that's when I spotted Taqueria mi Casita. Wow, talk about dumb luck, huh?  I've BM'd them before, but never had any luck finding them until today.  The front has a patio cover and the sign is partially obscured.   First thing I notice when entering Taqueria mi Casita was all the day laborers with their families having lunch. Second, I was the only Anglo in the place. Both good signs in my book. Lastly, there was a TB a hundred yards across the parking lot and it was empty.  Now what does that tell you?  I ordered something that I later found out was their Super Burrito ($6.29) by following the lead of the guy in front of me. Always pays off, I'll have what he's having I pointed. Sorry, no habe. Look at the pictures of that monster, the plastic spoon is tiny next to it, and it was only $6.29? Nice!  Will I be back?  Hell yes, I'll be back. My total bill with taxes came to $8.93, with a large drink. The horchata was delicious and my food coma made me skip dinner tonight. LOL  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tiny, slow, messy, and divey.  That aside, some of the best take out Mexican I've had in town. Just killer street tacos. Great carnitas, Carne Asada, and Lengua if you go that way. The staff is friendly and playful, always saying things like \"you want pico de gallo with that my friend?\"   So good that I went back the next day."}
{"text":"Came here on our recent road trip. The server was super energetic and made our experience fun! The food quality was great and I actually got to see it first hand due to the fact that the customer restroom is actually within the kitchen. Since I was back there, I saw one person doing some cooking. They seemed happy and the area was clean.   If I'm ever in the area again, I will be stopping by!"}
{"text":"Sorry but yes A 1 Star  one  My husband got fishtacos they were FROZEN they put them in the Microwave (DIDN'T see that coming) very disappointing Mexican places that I have been 2 they are always fresh!  That is why I give them a 1 star"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once.  At midday, I had the chicken enchiladas. They were very tasty and super affordable and overall everything was quite good.  The only downside was that they microwaved the tortilla, chicken, and cheese in the enchiladas.  I'm not a fan of microwaving food.  That said, everything was very good at a super high value ($7 for a plate).  I will be going back here for sure.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  After I have a few more things, perhaps this review could move to 5 stars.  Regardless, I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Taqueria Mi Casita's street tacos can't be beat. We pick up dinner here almost every week. Their pollo is the best I've had in the valley. My husband loves their tortas - try mixing pollo & carne asada - it's delicious!"}
{"text":"i was running a business errand in chandler and found this place by yelp. i had the carne asada burrito. you def get your bang for your buck here!! the burrito looked like it could feed two!! the price was good and the flavor was decent. nothing out of the world but i would stop by again if i was in the area."}
{"text":"Small little place that was packed at lunchtime on a Saturday.  You walk through the double doors and proceed to the right to order your food.  They make your food in front of you (assemble it) and then you pay.  We had a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream and a side of beans with cheese and chips.  It was very good.  Love the tortillas and how soft and creamy the beans were.  Plenty of cheese is put on the tortilla before the beans and after the beans.  I will stop in here for food again."}
{"text":"I've lived less than a mile from this place for 3+ years and I'm just now finding out about it?  WTH?   Searching for good, quick Mexican food shouldn't be hard, but I'm so over Filiberto's, so took a quick glance at Yelp and stumbled upon this place. After looking at the photos of the food, it was a no-brainer.   Chheng L.'s photo of the 1/2 carne 1/2 carnitas was what did it for me. Call me a copy cat, but I'm pretty sure I ordered exactly what was pictured and I'm SO glad I did. It was amazing!    Let me just say that the burritos are HUGE. The couple in front of us ordered several, and they stuffed one so much, they had to re-wrap it because the tortilla wasn't big enough!   We ordered 2 burritos and 1 veggie tostada. Out the door for under $15. Nice.    We will definitely be here again!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada burritos, a lot of dry over cooked meat and puddles of grease poured out while eating. Just had to try it once do to ratings? Filiburtos make a far superior Carne Asada burrito for cheaper!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Great service!!! Super friendly!!! This is my new favorite go to for authentic Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"The time I spent in Hermosillo, Mexico has been some of the best I've ever enjoyed. One of the best parts of going to Mexico is the amazing food, most of the time purchased from street vendors and taco stands. Going to this little taco shop brings me right back there.  They have a big array of meats that you can put into a taco-corn tortillas of course. The lengua(tongue) and cabeza(head) tacos are excellent. Most people are put off by these but I assure you if someone did tell you it was from these parts, you wouldnt even know. The carne asada(steak) is a step above most other places and the carnitas(shredded pork) is melt in your mouth tender and full of flavor.   Unfortunately, I have never seen the smokin' hot taco girl and therefore cannot give this place 5 stars. But if these posts are correct, then truly, it is I who is the loser here. I would recommend this place over almost all Mexican food places in the area. If you are looking for authentic flavor and the possibility of seeing a hot girl, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Authentic. Delicious. The workers were so sweet and friendly. Need I say more?! I didn't even take a picture because the food was calling my stomach so I ate all my tacos before I even was able to sit down!! Then before I knew it, I was back in line for seconds.................. highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall that is damn good...the red salsa is spicy and flavorful...when I went the carne quality was over cooked it was 4pm...I'm thinking the food is 5 star if you go at noon...I hope.  Okay I went a couple of days later and it was 1pm..the carne asada was fresher but still a bit cheap in quality.  This is definately one of my favorites for a burrito or tacos"}
{"text":"Fucking bomb. Real authentic Mexican food. Service was great and the food was even better!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food! Super authentic as well. Everything is reasonably priced. Overall, it was absolutely wonderful! :)"}
{"text":"Walked in on my lunch break, got my food, ate, and was blown away from the deliciousness that is taqueria mi casita! Definitely a new favorite spot.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Been back several times and tried a few other items on their menu:  Carne Asada Burrito w everything. Holy Cow! This thing is bigger than my arm. It puts chipotle to shame. It comes with two heaping scoops of rice, two scoops of beans, two scoops of carne asada, onions, cilantro, pico de gallo, cheese and sour cream and it's only $6 w tax. And I'm talking serving spoon scoops, not tablespoon status. It's a bit overwhelming for me, though. My BF loves it. I usually get mines in a smaller version and go without a few items. I like mines with one scoop of rice, no beans, carne asada, onions and cilantro and a scoop each of red and green sauce. It's like a perfect burrito and how I'm used to eating my burritos growing up in LA.   Super Nachos are huge. Enough for a family. It comes loaded with everything they put in the burrito I described above. It's decked out til you almost can't close the box.  Aside from the asada, I've had the pork on a few occassions. It's moist and spicy. when I get tacos, I get one with the pork for variety. Still the asada is king, here.  I like how they assemble everything in front of you. You get to tell them exactly how you want your food. Less of this, more of that... any way you like it.   Chips and salsa are free upon request. Whoo! Now this is how authentic Mexican restaurants roll! I wont even step foot in any -bertos place anymore."}
{"text":"One of the best little Mexican fast food places in Chandler. Although I've been stopping in here for a few years, I had not been in, in about 2 months. When I walked in the person making the food looked at me and already knew my order before I even opened my mouth! I was extremely impressed with that. That means they are taking pride in your order, looking you in the eye, and recognizing and remembering their customers. This doesn't mean they'll remember everyone's order, but I thought that was really cool.  Anyway on to the food. I always order a burrito and they are huge! You can add all kinds of extras and they don't charge additional for it. Sour cream, guacamole, onions and cilantro, peppers, hot sauce, pico de gallo... Whatever you want. I've also had the street tacos and also \"muy bueno.\" They have Mexican bottled soda in their fridge (no corn syrup, just pure cane sugar!), and free chips and hot sauce if you ask for it. Extremely friendly group of people. I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good carne asada burrito.   The have those big delicious thin tortillas that they grill right when you order."}
{"text":"THE BEST. So polite and courteous, fantastic customer service, their breakfast burritos are the best IvE had in the valley. Tortillas are FREsH , meat is delicious. It's not expensive, and it's so so delicious. Worth the visit! You'll never find a better place"}
{"text":"Really really great carne asada tacos! The carne asada has a nice flavor and tender. The enchiladas were great as well. Not the runny light colored red sauce you get at most taco shops. Fantastico!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos to an incredible price. I also had a flan for dessert. 4 tacos and a flan for less than $9.00. I know that I will be back. The guys working there are very nice and fast as well."}
{"text":"Do you like street tacos?  I do and I feel I have pretty high standards, all of which were exceeded by this place.   I got the combination plate (meat, rice, beans, tortillas) for just under 7 dollars. They even through in some deep fried jalapenos. That plate destroyed me in all the right ways. I ate about half of it and was completely stuffed. I got the pork BBQ and the carne asada and was pleasantly surprised by both quantity and quality.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you can survive as a family owned restaurant next to a Taco Bell for as long as this place has been around you must be doing something right? They do! There's no shortage of good Mexican food in this area of course, but I love that I can get something authentic like this, twice the value for what Taco Bell is offering right next door.  If they had a drive through, Taco Bell would be out of business at this location.  My favorite is the carne asada burrito. You get to choose your fixins like a subway, and they make it like you want. Bring your appetite, you'll get a lot for your money!  My only negative was the fish tacos I got once, like they were cooked and kept heated? Leathery...not juicy. No problem, everything else has been wonderful!"}
{"text":"I really wanted some good tacos, and this place just happens to be less than a mile from me. Honestly, sometimes I'm intimidated to some to some places because I don't know how to pronounce the names of the foods or I don't really know what I want, but I got some carne asada, carnitas, and fish tacos because I heard the people in front of me get it. Man it was delicious. Everything was ~$8, and I'm super stuffed. Ask for the cooked onions and chilis on the side. They're delicious."}
{"text":"Highly impressed! The food is seriously amazing. A lot of Mexican food places are kinda \"Americanized Mexican\" food. This place is the real deal. My BF had the Carne Asada Torta and I had a bean and cheese burrito covered in red sauce. I usually am picky about meat, so I don't order meat often. Never been a Carne Asada fan. But after trying my BF's, I plan to order one next time. Very delicious. The staff was wonderful and friendly too. I've been a yelper for years, my BF created a Yelp account just so he can review this place. Now he is addicted to yelp like I am.   So if you're reading this review and trying to decide whether to go or not, give it a try."}
{"text":"I consider myself more of a taco person than burrito, but I absolutely LOVE the pollo burrito and have trouble moving past it to try other things.  Finally tried chicken enchiladas recently, but have to go back to my burrito.  My husband likes the carne asada burrito.  Can easily eat here weekly!  Always a crowd, always friendly workers, always fun to see what other people order!"}
{"text":"Huge burritos for $7. Enough for 2 people.  Fresh and tasty!  Plus very friendly service.  I prefer going here vs the Taco Bell in front of them :)"}
{"text":"There are a dozen other reviews here saying the same thing.  The food is fresh and amazing.  Also inexpensive.  I would pay double for what they sell.  I am slowly working my way through the menu but anything fish (pescado) is awesome.  The steak (carne asada) dishes are also great.  I think next I will hit up the pork dishes.  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost everyday for lunch! What can I say? good price for great food! I love their beans especially. Definitely recommend to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Where I succeed in my workouts, I fail in my diet. But that's alright, because it's always nice to come back to town from the Midwest and try new restaurants. I appreciate the Mexican food here so much more than I used to, and Taqueria Mi Casita is your typical hole-in-the-wall, authentic restaurant. The Al Pastor burrito was incredible. As the burritos and tacos went down the line, they were prepared with speed and precision, with talent that makes you dread the next Chipotle visit (but not really).  I look forward to supporting this small business on my next trip back to Chandler!"}
{"text":"I had no idea Mexican food could be this good. This place blows my mind, and my tastebuds! Every time I go, I get the breakfast burrito, and it is THE BEST breakfast burrito I have EVER had! There is a Taco Bell nearby... no no no... go here instead. It's much cheaper, and worth every single penny!"}
{"text":"I was greatly disappointed!  Visually, this place had lovely food, but once you tasted it, little to no flavor, fatty and gristly meat and a lack of salt.  I took home 2 burros, both had rice and refried beans, one with carne asada and the other with carne al pastor.  A picture would have you salivating as I was as they assembled them. With the tax it came to 11.10.  My wife ate less than half a burro and I had to tear mine apart to salt it.  Just a poor experience.  They were quite busy a 1230 Monday lunch, I don't know why :("}
{"text":"The tacos are fresh. The flavors remind us of Mexico. Everything feels and tastes as authentic as one could imagine.  The service is traditional, and the employees are eager to complete your meal made to order. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys the authentic Mexican flavors. Jesus es mi sabor"}
{"text":"Don't know how I missed this place before.  Spotted it here on Yelp.  Had the chance to stop in for lunch.  The owner is VERY gregarious.  And loud.  Which is fine.  I like seeing an enthusiastic owner.  They usually want to do a good job.  This place seems to be pretty authentic.  The proprietor apparently is from Puerto Vallarta.  Fresh ingredients. Home made. Authentic and flavorful.  I had the burro (enchilada style) because I almost always get a burro or chimi when trying a new place so I have a basis to compare to other places.  When I said \"rice and black beans\" I had thought they would be on the side, but like many burro places he put them inside.  Which is fine.  Though ti did allow a bit of skimping on the meat.  It was very good, though.  My wife had the \"tacos\".  These are more like miniature tostadas except the tortilla is soft.  I think actually this is more authentic than either a tostada or a \"typical\" taco one finds in most places.  But again, lots of rice and tortilla, not as much meat.  Tasty, but just too many carbs.  A little more meat, maybe some added veggies (tomato, peppers, onions, etc) and a bit less on the starchy stuff would have helped.  Just three tiny tacos and a mound of rice (my wife opted for no beans).  I would probably rate this 3.5 stars, but I can't do that.  And the owner's enthusiasm and cheerfulness makes me round it up.  I think I will come back and try them again sometime.  Try something different.  The flavors were very good, but we just wanted a bit more meat and less starch."}
{"text":"Another colossal Arizona disappointment. I really just don't understand why it's so hard to find good Mexican food here.   Tried a carne asada burrito tonight- Way too big for any human to eat. Full of chewy meat, bland rice, flavorless beans, and a few specks of cilantro.   You should really send your staff to Southern California for a weekend to try some of the amazing little Mexican spots between San Diego and Los Angeles to see how it should be done. You're failing at preparing fresh flavorful Mexican foods.  I'm going to go and try to puke this up now..."}
{"text":"These tacos are the bomb!  My favorites are the steak with everything on them!  (I find the chicken to be a little bland.)   I am like the other reviewer, from San Diego and used to going to Tijuana for good tacos.  These are the best I've had here in Phoenix.    Very inexpensive and damn good."}
{"text":"I don't know if you have to consider my review about this place. I am a vegetarian and I just have one option.  Ordered: Burro Vegetariano - Tasted okay, not great. Its just rice, lettuce and some guac.. meh.  Poor ambiance and I am really unsure of the quality of food. You can opt Chipotle instead for the same price if you are looking for a burrito."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I ever had. The chicken just has so much flavor and not dry at all. I don't know what these guys put in the seasoning but I am coming back 5 days a week."}
{"text":"I found this place using this site and so glad I did. The tacos are amazing and great prices! The owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"This was really good. Great street tacos made in front of you. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"I came here on the advice of a local, granted she is not well versed in Mexican fast food.  We ordered a carne asada burrito.  The meat in this burrito was shredded beef of some kind, and tasted like someone slathered it with lawrys and salt.  It was horrifically over spiced and shredded I'm assuming to hide how bad it was.  Oh but it gets worse....they put some sprinkling of shredded cheese from what I assuming was frozen at some point then proceeded to put said chips in the *ucking microwave....are you kidding me?    It was 15 bucks, and I feel l could have got a more honest meal masqueraded as Mexican food at Taco Bell.  Microwaved chips....."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite authentic Mexican shops to get delicious burritos or tacos. I've tried their breakfast burrito, carne Asada burrito and chicken tacos. They make everything fresh right in front of you and ask what kind of extras you want like sour cream, guac, pico and their delicious salsa. My favorite is the red! I either call ahead or go in and order. I've never had to wait long and the gentlemen behind the counter are super sweet."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in this side of town ! I moved from OC CA a couple years ago and it was very hard for me to find some good , authentic Mexican food until My hubby and I discovered this place. Not only the food is great and super tasty but the service is awesome! The guys are making your food right in front of you always with a smile, singing and super happy to serve you, which is really hard to find now days. The portions are great, and the meat is juicy with lots of flavor. I totally recommend this place :) it always keeps us going back !"}
{"text":"The food tastes pretty good and they look like authentic street Mexican tacos. The prices though are over the roof for a taco ."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Feels East LA authentic.  Get the el pastor taco! Be patient. Watch out for birds.  :)"}
{"text":"I grew up in Southern California, half an hour from the Mexico border and I was raised around authentic, good Mexican food. I spent Spring Breaks in San Felipe eating seafood and tacos on the boardwalk and I took weekend trips to Algodones just for lunch. I know good Mexican food. Since I moved to Arizona 5 years ago, I have struggled to find anything remotely close to what I grew up eating. This is the closest I've found. Great carne asada and simple street-style tacos. You get what you see. This isn't that yellow cheese, lettuce garnished bullcrap that locals here are used to. This is consistently, genuinely good food."}
{"text":"Found this place looking for a taqueria on line. I wanted authentic mexican food. NOT taco bell! I found exactly what I was looking for. I got the Carne Asada burrito. It was bigger then Chipolte's for $2.00 less! The asada was very good and lean, no fat. I was staying in the area for 5 days and found myself eating here four times! Very friendly service and clean. My son said he knew it was going to be good even before we walked in because of the mexican music playing outside, and he was right! TAQUERIA MI CASITA ROCKS!  I will definately find my way back here again."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"local joints\" you see on TV and rarely have the opportunity to find in real life. I had their pollo and carnitas tacos and they were out of this world.  I can't wait to go back and try what else they have."}
{"text":"As advertised- the \"true Mexican taco.\" These are some of the best tacos in Chandler. Your choice of meat, onions, cilantro, and hot or mild. Of course there are add ons but I recommend keeping it simple! The meats are well seasoned and well cooked. I prefer the Pastor and Carne. I don't know his name but the gentleman who prepares your order is the man. He greets you as you walk in, does his job with enthusiasm, and thanks you upon your exit. It gets busy, especially around lunch so plan for some wait time. Not a lot of signage from the street, but find it (strip mall), and it will be well worth your time and money!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and love love their tacos and burritos it's so tasty! This weekend I ordered tacos to go. Super fast service, also they are so respectful and quick! I was in and out in 6 minutes. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoy authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to Mexican take out joint. My favorite is the burro carne asada. However the tacos are the shizzle! I have tried chicken, carne asada, and carnitas. Still need to venture into bbq pork ones. This place is constant busy but moves fast. Last visit i got breakfast burro...yum. only down side is the extra cost for certain items. These items are mostly americano requests...but anyway. I would skip beans and rice...costly add and didnt feel like it was worth it."}
{"text":"Still love this place, but have to make sure Mark J. knows I'm a SHE not a HE.  And yes, the TWO daughters of the owners are very beautiful.  I know which one you're talking about with the great eyes.  She gets it from her mama!    Yes Mark... very hot!"}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets! I tried this place for the first time and the tacos were absolutely amazing. Besides the amazing food and the awesome low prices, I love that they are so fast and efficient! My new regular spot..."}
{"text":"Went there today.  Quite possibly the worst service and worst Mexican food I have had in my living in the Phoenix area for 25 years.  The two cooks were extremely rude.  I had to repeat myself around 4 times for every little thing I wanted.  The cooks kept barking at me in Spanish, and would not listen to me when I would clearly ask for something as simple as a large Dr. Pepper.  I have not met anyone that rude at a Mexican food place since I ate at Burrito Express at Alma & Elliot.  The beef was terrible, low quality, salty gristle.  It is the saltiest Mexican food I've ever had.  I also ordered some enchiladas to go, and they didn't even cook them.  They just threw some cheese in a small tortilla and poured some sauce on it.  I am quite literally never ever going to go back there, and I would not suggest eating there.  Mucho Taco at Ray & Alma is easily ten times better.  They actually cook their food over there and put a lot of effort into the ingredients and have real recipes.  So far I haven't found anything as good as Mucho Taco.  They've literally got the best enchiladas I've had anywhere.  They are also inexpensive.  Their service is rude at times, but the food is excellent.  As far as Taqueria Mi Casita, everything about that place sucks.  I will never ever go back.  I can handle rude service, but not rude service combined with low quality meat that are piles of trimmed fat posing as steak.  There is quite literally no reason to go back to Taqueria when Mucho Taco is just a short drive up the street about a mile away."}
{"text":"Finally found a great place for authentic Pastor Burritos!  I've come here twice and the food's been excellent both times. There was line both times (which is a good thing!) but it goes very quick."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try something new, and stumbled across this place. Best decision we've made in a long time. The food was amazing, and the service was the best I've ever had. The staff was amazingly friendly, and worked very quickly putting the food together."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos... knocked off one star for the artificial tamarindo... jarritos I don't mind but the drink was just not good.  Had the classic Carne Asada... pastor was delicious even the lingua is tender."}
{"text":"Looking authentic Mexican food? This is the place! Inside is small and not fancy but the food rocks. Everything I have had has been very good."}
{"text":"Best food of my life. Never going back to Chipotle or filribertos ever again. I'm a changed man. 11/10 would foods again. My god, so reasonably priced. I'm driving across town every Friday. Never change your recipes or Management. Everyone needs to eat here. These people deserve bonuses. Meat cooked here is serenaded to sleep before it's seasoned and served. The line is only a minor barrier to the tastiest Mexican food ever."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Mesa! I had two asada, one chorizo and one adobada and they were just amazing! They were very generous with the meat and they were fast with the service! Will be trying other things from the menu ;)"}
{"text":"Its not often I write a review. Its either really good, or really bad. Unfortunately, I feel I have to tip the ridiculous 4.5 star rating negatively. You don't always find such a high rating with a 100 reviews but really? How can anybody like this? I grew up in AZ and CA my entire life. Ive never had worse Mexican food EVER. Absolutely disgusting. I spit out the carne asada taco I was eating, it actually made me cringe. Its was HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"This place is way under seasoned.  The beans were ok.  I hate that they use store bought tortillas.  I don't plan on returning.  There are better places near downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"When here for the first time and had a breakfast burrito and a carne Asada taco.  The place is very small but there was a line at the counter which tells me the food is good. People are coming after church to get some good authentic Mexican food.  Everything in the burrito was fresh including the tortilla.  The salsa was a little hot for me so I suggest getting that on the side. Also, the serving sizes are very large for the burritos so you might want to share one and decide if you want an extra one."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  The carnitas are amazing, simple as that.  Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican restaurant to eat at. The two main guys working here are very friendly and they go out of their way to make you feel at home and welcomed. I had the bean and cheese burrito which included fresh, homemade beans and delicious cheese. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito which was piled high and to the brim of the tortilla.  The atmosphere is small but clean, I had passed by this place many times on my way to Paradise Video and I had always wondered if this place was any good. While we were eating even a worker from Taco Bell from across the way came in and ate! A very nice family owns this small shop but damn with all the hype about the daughters, I was expecting a crossbreed between Salma Hayek and Eva Longoria. Calm down people, very pretty girl but damn she's not that hot. Let's concentrate on that delicious enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"Spotted this place in the same strip mall as Ace Hardware yesterday.  After a night out on the town a giant burrito was in order.  This place hit the spot.  It's definitely nothing fancy, but is perfect after you've been over served. The staff was very helpful and friendly.  I went with the carne asada burrito.  It was a good size and had good salsa inside.  The carne wasn't the highest quality, but I wasn't expecting that.  This was much better than the various fat food chains around and will be on my list for future recovery."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant yesterday evening. I had a carne asada burrito. This is the most authentic Mexican food I have had in 12 years in Phoenix. We will return."}
{"text":"Don't judge this book by it's cover. Tucked in the back of a strip mall on the corner of Alma School and Warner in Chandler Taqueria Mi Casita looks like any one of a thousand Arizona taco shops. One taste of their enchilada sauce and you'll know that you've found a special spot. Had the Bandanos Burro with carne asada and it was amazing. Fresh ingredients made with plenty of love. Great spot, friendly service."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried the chicken, carnitas, carne asada, and lengua tacos. I liked the chicken and he liked the carne asada, but we both preferred the carnitas to all of them. The carnitas were very flavorful, but all of the tacos could use a few more toppings. They come with cilantro, onions, and a hot sauce that is good, but very spicy (and I like spicy food). You have to pay 75 cents each for extra things like cheese, guac, sour cream, and pico. Personally, I think the cheese and pico should be included, as those are pretty standard. However, the tacos are super cheap - like $1.59 apiece. They each come in two small, soft corn tortillas that are quite good, hold up very well, and are plentifully filled with meat. The bottles of Mexican coke are also great. Love the sweetness.   It's a small dining space, though there was seating on a Sunday night around 6:30, but we still decided to get our tacos to go so we could add our own cheese for free. ;)   Update: Taco prices are up to $1.99 apiece, but they didn't charge us for the toppings, so that's nice. Still really good tacos."}
{"text":"Never fails!!!  Love their tacos!  Authentic Mexican tacos, they serve grilled onions, fried serranos, the salsas are tasty and spicy along with other regular toppings.  Oh!  And the flan is delicious too!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I would definitely give this place like 10 stars if I could!!!! I have lived in Chandler for 6 years and I just discovered this gem!!! And the worst part about it is lived down the street for a year and a half and drove by a lot to go to Taco Bell and never tried his place  I have not had tacos de Cabeza( cow head) that have been done right like this place since I moved here from San Diego when I was driving distance from Tijuana!! The food here is actually authentic, tacos like from a taco stand! And the service is fast and friendly, would def try if you're looking for an authentic Mexican food experience!"}
{"text":"The worst tacos I've ever had since my move to Arizona. Very disappointed!!! I checked the reviews and I was so ready to taste greatness. Today must have been a bad day. My tacos were the driest tacos I ever had. The meat was dry the tortilla was drier. My husband's co worker recommended this place and I was stuck on going to the place I normally get tacos at America's Taco Shop which has been consistent with flavor, and customer service. But leave it up to my husband wanting to try something new. I'm upset because Friday night is the only night we choose to eat out and this place wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"The perfect taqueria! Their meat is extremely tasty and really good quality, and their salsa is actually spicy! The Al Pastor (BBQ pork) is a must try. Also, their Horchata is 10/10 amazing. Doesn't taste like a powder drink like at those other places.  This place is perfect."}
{"text":"A very nice surprise.  Looks like nothing, tastes good.  Cheap, simple, fast and open late."}
{"text":"Fast (and I mean fast!) and quality Mexican food. We just moved here a week ago and have already been here three times. Everything I've eaten here has been amazing. Highly recommend the carnitas or carne asada."}
{"text":"If you want authentic mexican food, look no further.   Looks like a small take out place with very few seatings, not super clean but has one of the best folks who serve food whole heartedly. Their options might be minimal but are the perfect  local food i have had.   We ordered Pork burrito, chicken tacos and chicken burrito. Oh my gosh! the amount of meat they add u will be more than satisfied. U can add any topping, filling you want with no extra dollar. The tortillas are fresh, soft and delicious. Pork burrito is the best we have had so far, the meat so tender, its the tastiest burrito. The tacos I could easily eat 6 of those at once. Their sauce is very spicy so be very careful when u order. The jalapeno on the sides, just watch out. Also they serve horchata, jamaica, tamarinda for drinks which are delicious.   Overall great food at a even greater price. Go try if you want authentic no fancy Mexican food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for dinner. This place gets crazy busy. The seating inside is very limited so I suggest getting your food to go. Their burritos are huge two people can share it. I have to honestly say it's very good one of the best burritos I've had in a long time since moving here from So. Cal..,"}
{"text":"Amazing food would definitely recommend. Tacos and burritos are fire you can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"This kind of restaurant brings me back to New York. Everything is done right in front of you and it's really fresh. The Carlitos Special (mine) is eggs and chicken with every everything except rice. These guys are hilarious once you start putting everything on, they will call you out and start yelling louder each item. I love the personality and I want to go back now."}
{"text":"Most authentic/amazing tacos I have had in AZ!! I LOVEEEE tacos and I have checked out about 2 dozen places in AZ and this one is by far my favorite! Their flan is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great place for a breakfast burrito or other Mexican fast food.  They take their time preparing your order, and customize it to your delight (without charging extra for anything).  Great value for the quality and experience--it's always an inviting and fun place to visit."}
{"text":"Really good authentic food, staff is great and the place is clean! I love their breakfast burritos and it makes me happy that their salsa is spicy! No one wants not spicy salsa ! It's in a great location, although small and could be hard to miss. They work quick so don't walk away if lines are long !"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I was a little hesitant because the decor was very simple and seem a little unclean. My perception of the place quickly changed. The staff are extremely friend but a little hard to understand due to their broken English. The shredded meat taco was very tasty. Similar to the ones you can get in Mexico so very authentic. I've tried almost on the menu and have not been disappointed once."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time because of its high ratings. We got tacos only since we were craving for some. My favorite place is taqueria yaquis but since we were in chandler this was closer. I have family in Mexico, so I can say I've tasted some pretty awesome tacos in the past. Came here with a friend and ordered carne asada, pastor, and lengua tacos. The tacos were decent, my favorite out of the three is probably asada. They offered me a sample of the lengua, when asking whether it was good. Got the onions, cilantro, and grilled onions on them as well. We were asked whether we wanted salsa on the tacos, and we said yes. Got to choose hot or mild, we went with hot (we usually can take pretty spicy sauces) and daaaang was it SPICYY!! Not sure if that's how it usually tastes like, but it was abnormally spicy that I couldn't finish the tacos I had after having two of them. I would recommend getting the sauces on the side."}
{"text":"Holy Shit... I've had hundreds of breakfast burritos, but none were so fine as this one. My wife and I have been dieting relentlessly and decided to treat ourselves, so it was off to Yelp to find a place nearby. This is a small shop, but the employees are kind and work very quickly (but efficiently). They communicate very well to make sure you get everything in your burrito that you'd like. All of the ingredients are fresh and simply amazing. I don't think I'll be going anywhere else for a good burrito from now on.   Also, something to mention that I really enjoyed. This is a very authentic Mexican restaurant, which typically means the staff speaks little English, which is tough for us manchmal español speaking gringos. They speak English and Spanish. Very nice!"}
{"text":"This place has the most yummy food everrrrrr the prices are so cheap and it's so authentic so glad i found this little restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle, and there is absolutely no good mexican food there. A friend I am visiting lives less than a mile away from this place. The service was amazing. The food was hot and fresh. There wasn't one thing I was disappointed about. I'm said I live 2,000 miles away from this place because I would probably eat here every day. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I am 100% Mexican, a Taco lover.... I will tell you tht one of the Best Tacos in AZ is here. You will not regret the visit."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was quick and burrito was amazingly delicious !! I got the half pollo and half carne beef. The burrito was huge! Had to save half for later. Would definitely recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Very cheap prices and great quality food! Reminds me of my great grandmothers cooking. Love this place :)"}
{"text":"Went looking for Mexican food, and I wasn't disappointed! Super burrito was amazing! Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the few hidden gems of Chandler. People always complain about how we don't have any quality Mexican food (authentic is a different story), but they've never been here.   INSTANTLY when you walk in the door you're gonna hear \"HELLO MY FRIEND!\" from who I presume is the owner. He has been there every single time I've been and, without fail, has greeted me with a infectious attitude each time.   My go-to will always be their breakfast burrito with EVERYTHING. They stuff it with eggs, bacon, potatoes, ham, and chorizo, add in some salsa verde, onions and cilantro, and you got yourself an A1 Burrito. Little tip: I always let my burrito wait for ~3 minutes before jumping in. It's always a little too hot coming straight off the flat top, and this allows time for those flavors to really meld together to give you the best breakfast burrito experience. Pair it with horchata in the winter or a piña agua fresca in the summer and you're set. You will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taqueria in town. Excellent service, very nice, and excellent food. The al pastor quesadillawas great"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. The closest to authentic Mexican tacos I've tried in Phoenix. I definitely recommend everybody trying this place. Friendly staff makes a great complement to the place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Taqueria Mi Casita, but it just wasn't very good.  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and it was nice to see them interacting with regulars and newbies alike.   Ordered a Carne Asada burrito, and this sucker was PACKED full.   Unlike typical Carne, this was finely chopped beef vs. chunks.  No big deal. What was a big deal is all I could taste was salt. :(   Haven't been in a hurry to go back and see if this was a fluke, but definitely willing to give them a second chance per some recommendations Claudine F. made!"}
{"text":"Best burrito place in all of the area! Since we found this place about 3 weeks ago, my husband has gone probably 6 times. Great fast service. Always a line out door but goes quick."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is quite awesome. We ordered carne asada and chicken taco plates. Each plate comes with three tacos, rice, beans, and your selected toppings on the tacos. About $18 for two people. My only suggestion is that they somehow get the line moving more quickly. Otherwise, I really liked eating here."}
{"text":"I love this place.    I have had only a couple poor experiences with food here. One was a veggie burrito, What the hell was I thinking?  It blew.  Everything else I have had here has been amazing.  My personal favorite is the Chicken Quesadilla it is a taste de force.  The tacos are all the bomb diggity.  They are exactly like street tacos you would get in Mexico or from a taco stand on the streets in Phoenix.  Another good thing about this place, unlike other taco stand type places I have patronized, this one has never turned my GI tract into a Wal-Mart the day after thanksgiving. You know, lot's of traffic and little to show for it when the day is done.  Another Yelper said that a \"good looking family\" owns Mi Casita.  I will translate this for you.  He really meant to say \"The family that owns this place has a  smoking hot daughter.\"  I have stared into her eyes many time trying to remember what in the world I came in for.  She has eyes like the lady in the famous National Geographic cover photo.  Go to this place.  Mmm.... I am starving."}
{"text":"Authentic and so tasty! The line can be long and phone ordering is a nightmare but it is sooooo worth it lol. Some of the best asada in the east valley for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, was finally able to take and upload photos. Fast and friendly service. I love this place!"}
{"text":"OMG!! This place is delicious. Definitely a MUST for those who love Mexican food...legit...Authentic Mexican food!!   We had tacos here and everything was flavorful. The service was great too. They were busy but patient with us since it's our first time. Seriously, two thumbs up. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tasty street tacos that look as good as they taste, and very filling burritos.  I had the carne asada which was nice in that it was finely chopped beef, giving it a nice texture over just chunks of beef which can easily end up being too tough.  For drinks they have a myriad of aguas frescas, and Mexican Coca Cola.  Even their condiments are delicious.  The roasted jalapenos are out of this world!    The staff here are very friendly and attentive, providing excellent service even though this is more of a fast food type operation.  When the line for lunch died down, they went to every table to make sure everyone was happy with their meal.  They take pride in making authentic Mexican food and it shows!"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Best taco ever except for the ones my wife makes.  I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my coworkers."}
{"text":"Small little hole in the wall establishment. Okay for a quick lunch on the go. The food is prepared rather quickly. I had the chicken enchiladas with beans & rice on the side. The cook plated my beans & rice in a styrofoam container then continued to place corn tortillas and fill them with chicken. He poured the red enchilada sauce over the tortillas. Sprinkled cheese on them & the beans then placed the entire styrofoam container in the microwave. I'm assuming to warm up the food & melt the cheese. I'm not a fan of having my food heated up with plastic/styrofoam.. Then he topped of the enchiladas with all the fixings. The total cost was $6.65 for the combo plate. Not a bad deal, however I wouldn't rush back either."}
{"text":"This place never fails me. My brother introduced me to this place a few months back and I've been in love with their food ever since. I love their quesadillas with carne asada. They also cater for weddings and other events which is an added bonus. If you want real authentic Mexican food then this is the place to go. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Really really tasty food and at a super reasonable price. I ordered the bean and cheese enchiladas and they were so accommodating and really made sure the food was made to what I wanted. I always judge Mexican restaurants on their beans and rice- the best places really make sure the basics are great- and these rice and beans were very good. All said, I really enjoyed my visit and from the line out the door on a Thursday night, I'd say it's a neighborhood favorite too."}
{"text":"A great spot for a cheap, satisfying, and filling meal. The carne asada here is well marinated and delicious. The al pastor has good flavor, but I often find pieces of fat in my burritos. The beans are well seasoned and creamy in texture.   The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. Friendly employees. Plan for a wait if coming for lunch as the food is made in front of you."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for an after-workout meal, and I was immensely impressed. We had two lengua, one al pastor, one pescado, and one buche taco, along with some drinks and some of their homemade flan. Everything was absolutely delicious- exactly what I would have hoped for. They have roasted serranos if you want to add a little heat, and also some radishes if you need to cool your mouth down.   You really *have* to try their flan. It steals the show.   Seating is a bit of a problem, but not enough to dock a star- there just aren't enough tables, so you *might* have to sit outside... ah well, that's the price you pay for having great food in a small area!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos/burritos made to order...absolutely the best menudo I've ever had. Pops and I have been regulars here for years."}
{"text":"THIS IS REAL MEXICAN FOOD!!! Don't be fooled by \"mexican food\" places like Filiberto's or Roberto's or Ericberto's or Whateverberto's. That is not REAL mexican food. Calling those places mexican food is like calling Pizza Hut italian food. Mi Casita is the most authentic mexican food I've ever had in the states. The food is Jalisco style, meaning the tacos are served on two 4\" soft corn tortillas, the way a real taco is made. My go-to order is always a carne asada burrito (fresh carne asada, rice, beans, onions, cilantro, and red sauce, with limes on the side), an al pastor taco, a chorizo taco, and maybe a carne asada taco if I'm super hungry. The counter service is very fast and very friendly, they put everything together right in front of you. You will not be disappointed with this place if you're looking for AUTHENTIC mexican food."}
{"text":"So happy I found them! Absolutely amazing. Authentic Mexican food! 10 stars! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST carne asada tacos in town!!!! The only reason they do not get five stars is that if you decide you want to go on a weekday afterwork the meat tends to be a little dry.  But you can always put enough lime and salsa on it when it tastes this good and they are generous w/ sides.  Other than that the service is impeccable and if you can speak a little Spanish it goes a long way!  The guys behind the counter are contstantlysmiling, singing cleaning counters checking, stirring food.  Great vibe for people who aren't too uptight about there dining (.  HELLO YOU WANT AUTHENTIC MEXICAN YOU GOT IT!"}
{"text":"As Yelp says, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" I was expecting some bomb Mexican food based on the yelp reviews I've seen, but dang!  I know authentic Mexican. I grew up eating it & can make it myself, and this was completely subpar. I've pretty much lost faith in Mexican food in the Phoenix area. :(. The cleanliness of the service was questionable. (Maybe invest in multiple spoons for serving meats. I'd hate to have a pork allergy flare up after having you grab my carne asada [beef] with the spoon in the pork container). The food itself was just meh... Very little flavor and no sass. I'm disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Generous portions, excellent prices, and delicious food! If you're looking for a quick place to grab a bite, this hole in the wall offers an insightful vision into the heart of Mexican cuisine. The staff is super friendly and welcoming to all."}
{"text":"This is probably by far one of the best places we have eaten some real street tacos. It's a little place so we usually taken it to go. They don't skimp out on any meat or toppings."}
{"text":"I tried this place today for lunch and it was excellent! I tried a Carne Asada Burrito and the quality was outstanding. If you are looking for a quick place to get a taste of some Mexican food then this is the perfect place."}
{"text":"I had chicken and carne asada street tacos with rice and beans.  The tacos themselves were so authentic tasting and filling. The asada is very thin like flank, shaven almost but was good. The chicken had great flavor. The salsas were perfect in spice and flavor- they had a few different ones. This place is great for a quick taco. Dining in, they have around 5 or 6 little tables and 2 tables outside. Overall, very authentic street tacos with all the fixings.  I also came here for a breakfast burrito and it was pretty incredible too."}
{"text":"Food is pretty darn good, and fairly priced, to boot. Their salsas have flavor without being insanely hot, which I know some people will have differing opinions about.   Not much more to say about Mi Casita. It's worth a quick stop."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Amazing. The place to go when you want authentic mexican food. Their burritos are awesome and their prices are very good."}
{"text":"Really authentic, no frills, all parts of the animal street tacos. They are 2-3 bites each so order quite a few and have fun with the outside the box selections. I love the tongue tacos. The salsa is amazing and the area is safe. Great place to drop in for a quick snack of 3 tacos and jump back in the car and go back to running errands. I think the tacos here are less greasy than anything you can get at other fast food mexican places, therefore a bit healthier."}
{"text":"I am the taco connoisseur so believe me when I say this is the bomb.  Been coming here for 1.5 years and this is one of my favorite taco shops. I usually order the carne asada, lengua, buche. All great tacos in terms of taste and authenticity! My all time favorite would have to be the carne asada. I love the flavoring of the tacos because it is topped with cilantro, grilled onions, and peppers. I'm not the type to really care about service as long as I get my food, but the staff is really friendly! This is my go-to taco spot!!   Note: the horchata is good too!"}
{"text":"They have buche! This taco joint was a god send. On my recent trip I was confined to the Chandler area and ended up eating here 3 times. Best value, tastiest food I found in Chandler. Tacos de buche, lengua and cabeza were all great. If I am back out that way, this will be a first stop."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and the experience made me feel like I was back in Mexico at a taco street stand because the order taker was very quick and efficient at getting us our meal."}
{"text":"I recently tried this place on a whim and all I have to say is, \"wow\"! How have I not been to this place before? It is amazing!  If you love authentic Mexican food, but still enjoy comforts like sour cream, guacamole, and cheddar cheese, this place has got you covered.  Their various meats are high quality, well seasoned, and delicious. Their burritos are huge!  If you are feeling adventurous, order a variety of their tacos, each with a different meat, and discover your favorite kind!  Every time I have come here around lunch, there is a line out the door, because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Authentic yet quick tasty Mexican food in the same strip mall area as a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly,  inviting,  and best of all tasty food for a good price! Breakfast burrito is amazing!  Also have menudo, Cabeza and lengua.  Wash it down with a real sugar coke and you are eating authentic mexican!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 5*s all around. Have been going here for a good amount of time and I have yet to be unpleased. They are no stingy with the servings. You get exactly what you paid for which is really reasonable price. I tried it all and my favorite is el alpastor."}
{"text":"Sorry, I hate to do this, but the our food was so disappointing! Our burritos were really tasty, but unfortunately it kept falling apart, the main idea of ordering a burrito it's to not have to use a fork and a knife, not this one, every bite we took we had to set the burrito down and rolled it again! But again, to be fair, it was tasty, but a pain in the butt to eat!  My son ordered the fish tacos, what a mistake, my wife watched while they assembled his fish taco, and the guy picked the already fried fish taco and microwaved!!! What is that???  I took a by of his fish, and it tasted nasty and the texture was worse, it felt like they deep fried that fish 2 days ago and now they were using the microwave just to warm it up.  Sorry guys, I expected better from a place that looks so authentic."}
{"text":"I love tacos so much that every where I go it's a must to try tacos in any local area I am in. While in AZ I got to get my hands on some of Taqueria Mi Casita's and man it was damn delish.  With the price being right at 1.99 a taco I grabbed 3 chicken tacos and a Mandarin soda. Ugh it was so good!  The chicken tacos where shredded chicken which I love when it comes to tacos! I prefer it to be easy to chew and juicy. I find when the chicken is cubed that the chicken is not that juicy. The tacos came with cilantro, onion and lime just like I like it.   This place was busy but fast paced moving the crowed just as quick as the crowd came in.   The location is family owned with pops servicing the crowd and the gma handling the register with the kids helping in the kitchen. I loved it!   I will be back if I am ever in town :)"}
{"text":"A great little \"Tesoro Escondido\"! Delicious local flavor, great taste and excellent value.  ASOMBROSO!"}
{"text":"Not the best lengua and cabeza tacos, but you could do much worse in the valley. The tongue was a bit more toothsome than tender, and the cabeza was a little on the greasy side. The carne asada was really well seasoned and not too fatty though, and the carnitas were tender perfection-- muy delicious.   All tacos are served in a doubled up corn tortillas, which was kind of blah. It was a bummer considering there the corn tortilla tasted more like filler because they were a bit stale. At least there was a very generous amount of meaty filling per taco, each of which is topped with onions and cilantro.  The atmosphere isn't much to speak of, but when looking for a good taco joint, this generally doesn't regsiter on my radar. They could really benefit from adding some grilled jalapenos on the side of their tacos, or at the very least putting together a kick ass salsa bar. You know, the kind where you go overboard and get a tiny plastic container of at least four types of salsa, pickled veggies and pico. Hells yeah.   Oh, but they don't have that here. They do have some cheap and filling options for Mexican food that are much more authentic than the 'Bertos mold. Hit it up if you're in the area, drop a fiver and feast!"}
{"text":"The best street tacos on the east side.  Meat is great quality.  The tortillas, on point.  The salsa de arbol and the salsa verde is fantastic.  Tacos here are insanely good.  Try the pastor, carnitas, and chorizo.....great stuff.  You will NOT be disappointed here."}
{"text":"All I can say is I am Sitting here soooooo full. I had no idea how huge the burritos were so I have a meal for tomorrow too! Food is inexpensive and great! Lots of people were lined up for this place so I knew the food would be good. Nice outside seating too!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place driving to Taco Bell and wow is it good. Some of the best Mexican food I've had in the valley (possibly the best) is served here. Its near my work so I come at least twice a week. Awesome food, great prices, friendly staff. The owner is always there and great at remembering people. Just try this place, you won't be disappointed   PS. Try the cabeza tacos"}
{"text":"Holy cow this place rocks!  I have been eating my share of mexican food in arizona for quite some time.  It always tastes the same.  I came here and now I feel like I know what a carne asada burrito should taste like.  I was amazed.  I would like to continue to come here and try some other things.  The staff is also incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"The best taqueria in the valley hands down. Best food, great staff, can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Seriously, I cannot believe the ratings this place has, that said, Ive been there twice, the first time I was a bit disappointed but not so much that I wouldnt give it a second try. Let me begin by saying, I ordered 3 Al Pastor (Barbeque) tacos, that were chock full of cooked onions. After I removed the excessive onion from the three tacos, there was enough to fill a whole taco. Basically, 1/3 of the meat was cooked onion, I understand making a profit, but this is ridiculous. When I mentioned it to the \"chef\" that prepares the tacos, he seemed very offended and dismissed me with a comment about how no one had ever complained before. I explained it was my second trip there since the tacos had been quite good the first time, but the rice had been very overcooked and tasteless. He replied with  \"thank you for coming\" along with a most dismissive, devil may care attitude. As far as the quesadillas are concerned,they are far from being \"authentic\" as so many here on yelp claim, they are made with a mixture of jack and cheddar cheese. And if youve ever been to Mexico, you know theres no such thing there when it comes to quesadillas. But now on to the absolutely unforgivable part, while patrons think they are being treated playfully friendly, the truth is, theyre being insulted. How do I know? Well, I speak fluent Spanish and I can tell you, they are laughing AT YOU, not with you. As I was leaving, the same man making the tacos, called out a rather rude comment to a customer in Spanish, another worker chuckled. So I made sure to speak to him in Spanish on my way out, the look on his face was priceless. Read Shawn And Katrina P.'s review a bit further down on this page and you will see what I am talking about, apparently they too had a similar experience.  It always amazes me when immigrants display such contempt towards this country, especially when they are here making a profit they could never make in their native country. And they wonder why so many people protest their presence here..."}
{"text":"Really good food!! My husband had chicken tacos & bbq pork tacos. He really liked the chicken! I ordered a burrito, but realized they had a quesadilla already cooking. (The people before us ordered chicken & they made carne asada in error. So I took that one.) it was really good! Nice people too."}
{"text":"Super friendly service with great food, carnita's and carne asada are great."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken burrito Bamako which was very good, large fountain drink, all told about $10. Very limited seating inside and out, busy 10 people deep all the time."}
{"text":"Simply bomb ass Mexican Dive. this is a grab and go place. Amazing food.  Highly recommend everything other than Carne Asada. Not that it's not good but the Pastor is much better!!  Breakfast burrito are the best in town"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The guys behind the counter are always helpful, fast, and more than generous with their serving sizes! I have been here a few times now, and I have tried the breakfast burrito, various rice, bean, and meat burritos, and the meat quesadilla. Not a single meal I've had here has disappointed me, and I never end up still craving food from lingering hunger. The prices are good, the service is great, and the food is authentic delicious food. I will certainly be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Horchatas & $2 Tacos   I'm definitely a fan! They don't just have the regular carne asada, pollo, carnitas, al pastor. They also have cabeza, lengua, and buche. Sometimes I crave with \"weird\" stuff, so I'm glad this place has it all and is open pretty late! I tried the al pastor, cabeza, lengua, and buche. All of the meat was very soft and tender. The buche was a little chewy, but that's what you would expect from intestines. My favorite is the lengua (no wonder its a little extra)  There's no open toppings/salsa bar here, but you tell the guy behind the counter what you want and he puts everything on for you :)   The burritos looked big, so I'm going to be coming back for that!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos. They cook them in front of you which is nice. Everything else people ordered around me looked amazing too."}
{"text":"Located on the edge of Mesa and Chandler lies this gem of a small town Mexican restaurant. The food is authentic and delicious. It's owned by a family who still has their deep roots in Mexico and brings all the traditional flavors back with them. If you are feeling adventures to try something other than their delicious bean and cheese burrito, I  recommend the carne asada torta."}
{"text":"This is one of the most legit places I've ever eaten so beyond delicious two thumbs up five stars highly recommended"}
{"text":"Got carry out for lunch today. I had heard of this place from a coworker. Easy to find location. I was scared at first because I didn't know what to get. I ended up getting three carne asada tacos with beans and rice. Also added onions, cilantro and salsa. Had limes and chilis on the side. I had a 15 minute drive and that's when I ate it and it was amazing! So so so good. The chilis were spicy and good. The tortillas that are used are amazing as well. Overall everything tastes fantastic, oh and their beans are the bee's knees. Even after I finished my meal I kept thinking about it. I would have drove back to get more!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall place but definitely the best Mexican spot in Chandler. Burritos and Tortas are to die for."}
{"text":"We've been living in AZ for 3 three and a half years, and have lived around the corner from this restaurant for two and a half of those years.  My daughter and I were starving and decided to go try their chicken tacos.  The whole experience was delightful; the lady who fixed our plates was as sweet as can be, the food was colorful, and we decided to eat outside because the weather was beautiful. We ordered sides of rice and salad-skipped the beans. The salad didn't have any \"dressing\", but it was garnished with tomatoes and other veggies.  After experiencing many disappointments with Mexican food out here, we have now found a place that we can coin as our favorite Mexican restaurant in the East Valley...so far :)"}
{"text":"Huge freaking burritos. They put together one for my boyfriend and i swear it could easily feed a family of four! So your money will absolutely go far here :) Service on the other hand was incredibly slow and the guys were a little ditzy on getting things done. It was getting later in the evening so maybe they were just tired??? (Hey I'm trying here) Overall o.k spot to get a quick bite to eat. My tostada and pork taco were pretty good overall."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was awesome! Service was quick and friendly! Will be back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Wanted some real tacos on our last night in Arizona. Taqueria Mi Familia looked like it would be a goof choice and they definitely are. Nice selection of meats. The three Taco combination w rice and beans is a real bargain at $6.49. I got one each Cabeza, al Pastor and Chorizo. Topped with cilantro with grilled onions and roasted serrano peppers on the side. Accompanied by love me wedges and sliced radish. The family tried the Carne Asada tacos, tostada sin carne and nachos.  Everything tasted great. Great service and prepared to order quickly. A real gem"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best authentic Mexican taco restaurant by far! Cheap fast and friendly! Taco Bell is nearby drive away and come here, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"The best tacos I have ever eaten!!!! Staff is super friendly and quality of food is perfect! I bring everyone I know here and no one has have ever left disappointed."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious! I eat here about once a week because it fills me up for cheap price and the people who work there are really fun. it's like a subway sandwich restaurant for Mexican food. I love the burrito w/ Cheese, Beans & rice w/ sour cream, less than $5 and best in town for that price"}
{"text":"Really good! Came here for the first time 2 weeks ago and have already been back twice."}
{"text":"I had the chicken enchiladas and carne asada taco. Cheese enchilada was not cooked. They microwaved my plate and the inside of the enchilada was uncooked. The other enchilada was chicken and the meat was ok but the tortilla was overcooked. Beans were runny. Rice was ok. I've had better Mexican food, I may not come back unless it's the only thing open when everything else is closed."}
{"text":"When I told my friends back in San Diego that I was moving to Arizona, they told me I would be deprived of the great mexican food that Southern California is known for.  They were wrong.    This place is amazing.  Its basically just like Chipotle except the food is authentic unlike chipotle, and it doesnt suck, unlike Chipotle.  They PILE on the meat here.  I have tried the carne asada, pollo, lengua and adobado pork.  All have been fantastic.  Quality of the meat is about what you would expect at this price point, but delicious none the less through expert preparation.    If you havent had beef tongue, I highly recommend giving it a try here.  They do everything right.  Tacos are served street taco style with onions, cilantro, and lime (or however you want it).    Taking one star off because I was charged an extra $2 for a burrito that I made \"especial\" by adding avocado salsa, cheese, etc.  Small price to pay, I suppose, for being a gringo in an authentic Mexican establishment.  Food is solid 4.5/5."}
{"text":"I got a breakfast burrito from here. I got in around 2p on Sunday, and they said they were out of Chorizo, and offered bacon. I like bacon fine, but breakfast burritos with bacon usually over do it, and it's way too salty. I asked for carnitas, and they said it was ok.   I didn't keep an eye on it, paid and left. When I got home...it was bacon. And as I expected, the bacon overpowered everything else in the burrito. And it wasn't good bacon. It was a bad burrito.   Deconstructed a bit, the tortilla was good. Potatoes and eggs seemed capable. I didn't notice much cheese. I think it would have been a better burrito with a more balanced meat.   Price seems fine for portion size.   Price was good considering quantity of food."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house. I come here all the time, love the breakfast burritos! They are always made fresh right in front of me, and you get a lot of food for the money. In fact, writing this review is giving me a craving. I've been going to this place since shortly after they opened-the first time I went I nearly cried because the rice tasted just like my grandma's. Sometimes they can go a little heavy on the salt, but it's so tasty I don't mind. It's a hole in the wall place so don't expect a lot of seating, but it makes up for it in delicious food."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's a little hole in the wall on the NWC of Alma School and Warner and I've probably eaten here 20 times, maybe more. I found this place on Yelp so I apologize for not Yelping sooner. Super friendly folks making your grub. They really pile on the meat and toppings on your order - the burritos are humongous.  I usually get the street tacos but will mix in a burrito on a regular basis. To me, their best meat is the Al Pastor (BBQ Pork) but their carne asada is solid as well. Breakfast burritos are excellent too. Everything I've tried here is delicious, authentic, and filling!   It's usually pretty packed during lunch time during the week but the line goes fast and they have outdoor seating with misters if you can't get a table inside.  They have Pepsi products and my ONLY wish is that they had Mt Dew - I guess there's always room for improvement!  Awesome place to get a food coma! Great local non-chain restaurant - try it and thank me later."}
{"text":"We eat at this place regularly and honestly have never had a bad experience.  Their street style tacos are amazing and always fresh! By far my favorite is the burrito bandido!"}
{"text":"Have you ever wanted to try a restaurant that wasn't a chain?  We try to do this from time to time and yes have finally found one .... the location was in a strip mall and not expected to be as good when you look at the appearance etc.... it's pretty authentic....   The staff was amazing and looks to be maybe family run... I just had the 3 tacos with rice & beans and my husband had enchiladas.... wow!!!!!    I asked for salsa and went ahead and made it hot instead of mild and could feel the heat like no other but still had an amazing taste to it.... Most salsas don't taste good...  A must go and saw another group of people who purchased the burritos and those were like a 2-person burrito ....."}
{"text":"\"If you eat Chinese food, your farts come out like Chinese food. If you eat Mexican food, your farts come out like Mexican food. And milk, it's like --  you can smell the warmth in the fart. My wardrobe on Transformers always smells like farts and I have no idea why.\" ? Megan Fox  So my normal go-to place for Mexican is a place that translate to, \"The Favorites.\"  Deciding that I wanted to try a new place, I fired up the trusty Yelp app and found this little gem.  The beautiful Angela T. gave this place five stars so you know I had to stop by!  Burro Bañado (Enchilada-style burro smothered in enchilada sauce and topped with cheese):  We used the red salsa on this and it sure gave it a nice kick.  I wasn't sure if the charred jalapeños [which are AMAZING] were the culprit or the red salsa but I was burning up in a good good way.  It was delicious and the portion was ginormous. I also like their enchilada sauce.  Chips and pico de galo were served on the side which I thought it was a nice touch.  Breakfast Burrito (Eggs, bacon, chorizo, and potatoes):  Top this with the very mild, AKA baby spice] green salsa and it was satisfying!  I got mine with some beans, cheese, and sour cream and it was a pretty hearty burrito.  I love that you can watch them cook it on the flat top so you know it's going to be hot, fresh, and delicious.  I also got some rice and beans with some chips on the side just to see how everything tasted.  They were both decent.  The beans were a bit watery but the flavor was good.  While my heart and taste-buds remains true to, \"The Favorites,\" this place is a great alternative and definitely a close second.  I would love to come back to try their tacos, nachos [\"The Favorites\" makes some lame nachos], and even the menudo.  The service here is also insanely friendly and they're a heck of a lot nicer than the people at my #1 spot.  It's a cozy spot so I recommend taking it home to eat."}
{"text":"I visited here from out of town with a friend and absolutely loved my experience here. Instantly, you are welcomed by two very friendly restaurant staff members whose attentiveness and care for customer are truly unmatched. The dining area is rather small, but I believe many people carry out so seating is not an issue. The Mexican cuisine is unbelievably good. I had 6 tacos, 3 with chicken and 3 with carnitas (pork). Topped off with some red sauce, cilantro, and onion, these tacos proved to be some of the best I have ever had! I wish I lived in Chandler, AZ so I could visit here more often. I highly recommend for anyone craving low cost authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Wow !! Seriously amazing this is as good as it gets !! I'm very picky with Mexican food. This is Noh your typical greasy Mexican American place this is auténtico Mexico!!!!  All the meats are amazing the tortillas freshly made and the salsas are so good!! Would definitely recommend this taqueria !"}
{"text":"This family owned taco shop is the real deal! The food is unbelievable. The beans are creamy and full of flavor. The tortillas are soft and warm and delicious. Don't let the the lines scare you. They serve up the food fast and will have you eating in no time! There's several small tables to sit at if you want to dine in and many people seemed to be getting it to go. It seemed that most people were ordering the carne asada burrito with beans and rice or the carne asada tacos. We had the burritos and will try the tacos next time."}
{"text":"I came across this place not too long ago while suffering through a savage craving for anything Mexican (this happens a lot to me). I was driving around in circles looking for a little dive that might have some authentic and spicy tacos. I just so happened to see a cheap little sign pointing towards this place, and figured what the hell.   First things first... upon walking into this place I noticed it was a little rank; it didn't smell very good, and it was pretty muggy inside. There were two Hispanic gentlemen behind the counter who immediately welcomed me as I quickly studied the menu on the wall. What I first noticed about the menu is that it was all very authentic... very much like if the building was picked up and moved over to Chandler from some small Mexican town. As I was looking, I also noticed some sort of weird mound of meat on a giant metal stick; it was clearly visible in the back room which I'll admit scared me a little bit. I think I may have seen something similar on \"Bizarre Foods\" once... but I have no idea what the hell it actually was.   Given such a wide array of different choices from the menu, I was immediately puzzled about what I would actually order. This is when one of the guys behind the counter tried to give me some help... he started asking/telling me things in very broken English... like \"You like Spicy?\" and \"Good Pollo!\". While he was telling me these things, I got the sense something fishy was going on; because as he was talking to me he was also intermittently laughing hysterically and speaking Spanish with his work buddy. Kind of seemed like one of those \"look at this stupid gringo\" moments. I was pretty out of my element. To make a long story short... I went with the chicken tacos (except they were called something else, which I didn't understand) and an order of chips with salsa. I took home my steaming back of goodness to pig out... and OH NO... they couldn't have... the horror:   Dark meat chicken... Arrrrrrrrrgghhhhhhhhh!   I take for granted that there are still places that serve dark meat chicken without thinking twice about it or warning you... I also take for granted that there are people out there that actually like dark meat chicken. I can't stand it... to me dark meat chicken tastes like white meat chicken which has gone rotten. I have an immediate gut reaction to it, so needless to say I took one bite of my taco and threw the rest away. I did however eat my chips and salsa like a madman, and they were pretty tasty... so I can't fault them for that.   So this may be a tad unfair... but I feel like a lack of white meat chicken shows that a restaurant is cutting corners and using sub-par ingredients. It'd be like if Jamba Juice used Kool-Aid or Tang to make their smoothies... not cool! If I return I'll try something else non-feathered and I'll leave room for the possibility of an upgraded review... but for now I'm going to brand Taqueria Mi Casita with a shameful 2/5 stars."}
{"text":"I came in around 8:30 last night because couldn't stop thinking about tacos. Real authentic tacos.... Not Taco Bell, filiberto's or Amado's. Typically I don't go to new places without a friend assisting through the process however, I felt adventurous and nothing can keep me and my cravings apart. I am normally afraid of not knowing how to order or not speaking the language. When I walked in, I think they could tell it was my first time... I stuck out like a sore thumb. I ordered 5 tacos- 4 carne asada and 1 al pastor- to go.  He even arranged it according to how I wanted them 2 carne without cilantro and onion and the rest with. I asked for red sauce but completely forgot ask for lime which what was lacking to complete the meal but that's my fault for not remembering to request it. Overall, this will be my go to place. The tacos were on point. The guys here are very sweet and are willing to help. The experience didn't make me feel like an outsider or misplaced.  It reminded me of taqueria's in California- definitely a lot smaller. The meat isn't displayed cooking like a gyro like how it is California but the taste is there."}
{"text":"I moved to AZ from southern CA,  grew up on mom and pop authentic Mexican food.  Once in AZ I looked high and low for the same excellent authentic Mexican food.  I finally found it here, this being their 2nd location, their 1st is in Mexico.  You will most likely be greeted and served by Jaime and Maria.  They truly take pride in their jobs and it shows.  The food never fails in its taste and quality, but their service is excellent.  Selfishly I don't want to share this place, but....... Well I am.  Enjoy, be filled up.  Your tummy will thank you."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the street tacos here. Burritos, both bañados and dry, are delicious too. I like the nachos too. Think I'm trying to say that I like everything here. To top it off, the people at Mi Casita are seriously the friendliest restaurant employees ever. I like this place and it likes me."}
{"text":"The food and staff here are equally amazing. It's set up similar to a Subway, where you say what you want and can go down the line. There is a mixture of meat that is already prepared and meat that isn't, so sometimes it does take longer to prepare your food. The breakfast burrito is amazing, especially if you get everything on it. The staff is bilingual so that people like myself who can't speak Spanish can still enjoy their delicious food."}
{"text":"I am giving them 4 stars, and they might have received 5, but no jalapeños! Had the lengua tacos, the carne asada tacos, and the nachos - everything was super tasty and the salsas were superb. Prices were very reasonable, and the place was hopping at 9:30pm, so, be prepared for a line...but great food. Small strip-mall location, but if you're there for the food you won't be disappointed. I'm going to get a carne asada burrito next time - they were huge!"}
{"text":"This is my secret love near my home. Holy hell, their street tacos are my favorite. I get the carne asada an love extra lime. The red sauce has a great flavor without being too hot to eat.  I try to come here at least weekly. The burritos are also huge. You can't go wrong. If you like el Pastor, it's super tasty, too."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the valley!!! I have yet to have a poor experience!! Every dish just melts in your mouth. I recommend everyone come here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a good place in my neighbourhood to pick up some fast food when I don't have the energy to cook (pretty much always).  It's a small place, with authentic mexican items on the menu like tongue and other animal parts that most Americans are not used to.  I have to say that while the staff was really nice, once I revealed that I also speak Spanish (my looks are deceiving), they were extra nice to me.  Their fish burrito is huge and the tacos are small, and super tasty, just like in Mexico.  It's a bit hot in the place, I don't think they have A/C, but it's nice in the winter and spring, and you can sit outside also at a couple of picnic tables."}
