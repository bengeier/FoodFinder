{"text":"I just ate here for the first time. I had the vegetarian rolls and grilled pork banh mi, along with an iced coffee. I could easily imagine a life in which I ordered nothing more than the veggie rolls on repeat--and that would be a fine definition of heaven. The whole experience made me want to do it again immediately. Higher brain functions kicked in and I decided to come back later."}
{"text":"Had to take a double triple take.... my god, this is by far the smallest Banh Mi I've ever seen or bought! I've had bigger, better, and much cheaper Banh Mi. Not worth it.. Fail!"}
{"text":"Great taste. Tried 3 different Banh Mis. Low price. Friendly people. Would go again and again."}
{"text":"Soooo, I just may have a slight addiction to this place. I have been coming here once a week for about a month and it has been consistently good. The Banh mi (Crispy #1) is really good (watch out Le's) and the fruit smoothies with Boba are great and made with real fruit. It is small- only 5 tables and 4 bar stools, but the service is fast and friendly. About $10 for a sandwich and smoothie, which are very filling and fresh. Be sure to get a drink card- your 10th is free!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews were spot on with this one. The banh mi and che were both good. While I usually frequent Be's, since I'm in Ballantyne, Crispy has better banh mi and is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was surprised at how cheap the sandwiches were. I thought they'd be smaller sandwiches given the price, so I ordered two (crispy delight and cold cut combo). Boy was I wrong, I felt full after one sandwich and took the other one home."}
{"text":"Hot diggity this place is awesome. Great bread, vegies pickled just right. Ate our lunch and ordered more to go. That'll tell you something."}
{"text":"Great bahn mi sandwich. Delicious smoothies and slushies. The ingredients are clearly very fresh and they have some more exotic flavors like lychee, durian and Jackfruit. Even better they get sugar cane from Florida to make fresh sugar cane juice - a real south east Asian flavor!"}
{"text":"The banh mi here is great and they serve it to you fast. The smoothies are good too. I look forward to trying more from their menu"}
{"text":"Great little spot behind the Pep Boys on South Blvd. All sandwiches under $5 (sides and drink are extra). Had the \"crispy favorite\" with grilled pork - delicious. They take Vietnamese meat and toppings and put it in a hoagie. Small restaurant, high quality."}
{"text":"Grilled Pork Banh Mi is my default choice in all the places I've tried, and this place's offering didn't disappoint.  The bread is quite light but does have a slight chewy texture to it even after toasting.  The grilled pork filling is better than other places where they use fatty meat instead to cut costs (I'm looking at you - Pho Plus!).  Price wise, very reasonable at $4.50 and while I still like Le's Sandwich better, I can see myself frequenting this place as I don't have to nativate through the potholes and the sad looking shopping mall just to get a good Banh Mi."}
{"text":"Great for a light and quick lunch. Super affordable and fresh. Inside has limited seating, but it's clean and well lit. Great selection of fun drinks too! Right before the Autozone on South Blvd."}
{"text":"Their menu is a diverse variety of crisped baguettes, each filled with a different protein, and not to mention, a risqu√© sundry of sweet and spicy, vibrant vegetables; jalapeno, cilantro, carrots and rectangular, mandoline-sliced cucumbers. In other words, if you were searching for a rejuvenation, you will find it in this small, sparkling, light-soaked sandwich shop.   The classic Banh-mi is a sensory adventure, of vivacious botanical-colored vegetables; just delicately placed atop a thick layer of sliced ham, which drips its salty-sweet juices from the brittle edges of fresh bread. Not to mention, the portions are phenomenal! When you order a Banh-mi, you get two half sandwiches for the total size of a sub; and it costs less than five bucks. Who says you can't upgrade your appetite, without upgrading your budget?    If you are a true Charlottean foodie, you need to go here immediately!!"}
{"text":"Decently price, fresh made to order bahn mi sandwiches. My favorite is the grilled pork sandwich. Service can be a little slow sometimes but pricing is great.  They also have a good selection of smoothies. I don't care too much for the dessert drinks compared to Bambu. (We don't have one in Charlotte btw) They also offer a variety of selections such as summer rolls, spring rolls,  sweet potato gross and other delicious appetizers that won't hurt your pocket!"}
{"text":"On a friend's recommendation I dropped in this Saturday morning. I was greeted very promptly. I ordered the grilled Ckn sandwich with wings. * about $10* The interior space was neat and efficient....tables and a big screen where the college football was playing. I took a seat on a stool by the window, where a bar style tabletop provided a clear view outside. A couple that came in after me ordered one of the juices that are apparently pretty notorious. It looked good! I'll try on the next visit. It took about 15 minutes to get my order. The veggies were crisp and the grilled ckn was perfectly seasoned and JuST spicy enough. It felt light and clean ! The wings were pretty good too. The sandwich alone could have filled me up. My eyes were bigger than my mouth.  Great experience. Nice price.  Very good food! I'll definitely be going back soon.   Returned on 9/8. Same great level of surface. Consistent food quality. And did I mention the crispy banh mi grilled ckn was less than $5??  Updating from 4 to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It was very exciting to hear from a friend that a new banh mi place opened in charlotte near my work and midtown.  My wife and I love banh mi, and try a lot of places wherever we go from Falls Church, atlanta, Santa ana, portland, denver, and dallas.  We have our share of banh mi. So one day during lunch, I decided to try out Crispy Banh Mi and ordered their Crispy favorite and added $1 for extra meat.  The sandwich was very disappointing.  It was toasted but tasted like stale bread, chewy and hard, instead of crispy like their business name.  Even with the extra meat that I ordered, it appeared to have barely any meat.  The sandwich itself was dry due to very little mayo and pate.  I don't mind paying $5 for a viet sandwich, but it's quality must match the price. This place is in no comparison to Le's sandwiches at Asian corner mall.  They need to open another Le in south charlotte area. Overall, the owner of Crispy Banh Mi had the right idea and ambition, but lack experience and expertise.  The sandwich tasted amateurish.  No offense, but I can definitely make a better sandwich buying a Harris Teeter hoagie and order viet meat supplies from California. First time was disappointing.  I'll try again soon to see any difference.  Let's hope they read these reviews and make adjustments, because their current business venture seems bleak."}
{"text":"Love it!  Will come back again and again!  Staff excellent will explain everything to you."}
{"text":"Quality of the food was great. Very friendly staff. Thought it was a bit pricey but will diffenately return."}
{"text":"Update! Went again and the AC is fixed and the sandwich was even better than last time. So so good. I want another one. I'm supposed to go to the gym. (Currently thinking of how I can smoothly tell my bf I SO went to the gym)  Anyway    Get the grilled pork and one of their specialty drinks!"}
{"text":"We went over because of the good review and we love Vietnamese food. However, I have to say this is a disappointment. The Bahn Mi was okay, meat was smoky, not in a good way, the pickled vegetables are not as how they are supposed to be done, lacking a lot of flavors. And service was at best C+ if I were to grade it. The cashier girl was not nice, even after I was trying to joke and smile at her, she has this deadpan face. No one in the restaurant smiles...oh well...guess we are not going back again..."}
{"text":"Living in Northern Virginia has given me a chance to try a lot of banh mi places. Crispy Banh Mi is on par with the places I usually go to. Ordered a banh mi dac biet with fried egg and a Thai tea to go. So far this is the only banh mi joint I've been to that puts 2 eggs on their banh mi! All the other places I've ever been to just give you 1. Kinda blew my mind when I saw the 2 fried eggs. Good bread and good meat/veggie/bread ratio for their sandwiches.   My only minor complaint is they forgot to cut our sandwiches in half. Happened for all 4 of the orders my coworkers and I picked up.   Forgot to ask but I don't think they have the buy 5 get 1 deal that I'm used to back home."}
{"text":"We ordered the grilled pork roll - it was one of the best sandwiches I've had. It was absolutely delicious for under $5.00 a sandwich! We put some Sriracha on it too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese sandwiches. I had the BBQ pork banh mi and loved it! Delicious Thai iced tea. Friend and I had the #2 dessert. Service kind and helpful; felt welcomed and comfortable. A new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Perfect! I love this place. Best banh mi I have ever had and im from San Francisco where there are tons of great banh mi places. Ill go back for sure. The workers are super nice to."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great, and affordable!  Grilled pork (with pickled vegetables and fresh cilantro) is my favorite.  Teas are VERY sweet, so order carefully ( they are also VERY expensive do ask for a drink card).  Everyone is very nice."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were visiting Charlotte for the weekend and stumbled across CBM.  We saw the great Yelp reviews (Thank You Yelpers!) so had to give it a try.  It was AMAZING!  We got two Banh Mi sandwiches (grilled chicken and BBQ pork) and also a grilled chicken cold noodle salad.  Everything tasted great and was very fresh and reasonably priced.  The noodle bowl was spectacular and the Banh Mi bread was perfection.  The only sad part is that we won't be able to go there again!  Definitely give this place a try.  Friendly, quick service and fantastic food."}
{"text":"This place was so amazing! Awesome staff and fantastic Bahn Mi sandwiches. We will return!! Don't forget to try the Lychee tea or Vietnamese coffee!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Banh Me in Charlotte. Very authentic taste with fresh breads. The place is clean and simple. The owners and their employees are very friendly. We are very happy when they opened this store. We also love their bubble teas. We been back almost once a week to this place."}
{"text":"Oh Crispy Banh Mi......you are going to get me into trouble considering I can walk here (yes, walk.....5 minutes) from my house.   We have been to Crispy Banh Mi numerous times. It is tucked away off of South Blvd, right across the street from the Panda Express (of which I have never visited, fyi....just a good landmark). There is some seating inside but we usually take it to go.  I was craving a banh mi for lunch and walked on over. My order was the grilled pork banh mi, summer rolls, and a boba thai tea. The banh mi's are huge and all like $4-$5. Honestly, I would be full with just that! The summer rolls are tasty, come with two in an order, and come with this delish sauce! The thai tea is perfection. There are so many different teas, smoothies, drinks that they all make in house.  Absolutely excellent product at an amazing price!"}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars Their banh mi was on the smaller side. Ordered the grilled chicken - well seasoned, but a little dry. My kids seemed to enjoy the egg rolls.  Boba - 3 stars My go-to order at boba places (in San Francisco anyway) is black milk tea, so I was little bummed that their milk tea was limited to jasmine. It tasted ok. The boba had a good, chewy consistency, but tasted bland."}
{"text":"Very good! The grilled pork bahn mi was delicious, Best I've had in Charlotte. We also sampled some of their speciality drinks. The pomegranate green tea with jelly was good, i could have done without the lychee pieces because they had a weird texture. Could have just been me though."}
{"text":"This place had opened up a for a few months now and I absolutely love it! Growing up as a Vietnamese-American, I eat lots of Vietnamese foods and Crispy Banh Mi is one of the best besides Lee's Sandwich. I'm also a picky eater myself, but this place is really good. Great friendly workers too. I came here 3 times already this week! I would always get the Classic Banh Mi or the grilled pork."}
{"text":"Freshness!!! I've been here twice now and I couldn't be happier with my food or the customer service. Everyone is always friendly and service is quick.  I've gone with the #4 pork sandwich each time. Bread was fresh, meat was hot and veggies were crisp. I have also had a smoothie (can't remember which one) and a iced coffee. I love how their cups have a sealed top and you get a sharp straw to punch a hole through (ha, it's the little things for me :) ).  There are a few tables for seating and parking is not a problem.   I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Don't bother. The people were nice but the sandwiches left much to be desired. Be prepared to know what a bahn mi sandwich consists of and the various options available.  The price was nice but there are better bahn mi's in town."}
{"text":"Went here for a brunch sandwich. I got the pork sandwich they recommended. It came with sweet/savory marinated pork on a toasted bun with fresh cilantro, cucumber and bell pepper. It was delicious. The service was wonderful. If I lived here, this would be a weekly spot for me! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great deal,  $4.25 for a grilled pork sandwich (their prices are currently wrong on their menu).  Doesnt get much better than that for lunch. Add fries on for an extra couple bucks.  Meat is very well seasoned and pickled vegetables are on point. This is the best Banh mi in Charlotte so you should try it out here if you haven't had it before."}
{"text":"Delicious! My 8 year old and I both loved it.  He had the chicken sandwich with the veggies on the side, he usually is the typical kid that loves chicken tenders.  I had the chicken noodle dish, chicken was a bit dry but overall super good, came with 3 yummy grilled shrimp cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I did not read all of the reviews, but of the ones I did read tofu was not mentioned so I took a chance. I ordered veggie sandwich and a side of fried tofu. The sandwich was just okay. I did not come with jalapenos like it was suppose to so I am glad that I grabbed some sriracha to go. The fried tofu side was awful, greasy, bland and not crisp at all. The tofu was also on my sandwich, because they ran out of whatever they normally put on it, and it had the same taste. But all of the sandwich toppings made it okay.   I gave three stars because I plan on going back and trying the sandwich again how it is suppose to be made. But I will not be eating the tofu again, and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out Crispy Banh Mi that a friend of mine referred me too. As soon as I walked in, I can smell the fresh baked bread. Most places have bread that is just thick and just too much. Crispy Banh MI's bread was baked just right, not too thick or too long and bulky that would fill you up faster. They have an extensive sandwich selections accompany with some light appetizers.   What was really cool was the worker's attire, the girls wore the traditional dress \"ao dai.\" The guy behind the counter was really helpful and helped me choose the teas . I tried the green tea with lychee and mangoes with jelly. Gosh, it was really good. I should have gotten another one for the road. Most of the time I cannot finish my tea, but with this place I drank and ate all of the fruits because it was cut small enough to go thru the big straw.   I will definitely try Cripsy Banh Mi again when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely scrumptious!!!  The grilled chicken bahn mi is flavorful and incredibly filling! Shrimp summer rolls were refreshingly ice cold and the dipping sauce was so amazing.    I ordered the fruit delight which was excellent and took all the heat out of my mouth from adding sriracha to my bahn mi.  On our second visit of the week we also tried the coconut smoothie and lychee smoothie with passion fruit pearls and skipped out sipping them on a hot afternoon.  FANTASTIC experience!"}
{"text":"BBQ pork Banh Mi for $4.50 is a must try. It's the best on the menu. The ingredients are always fresh and the bread is baked  just right."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I have now been eating here at least once a week for two months.  Today I finally tried the BBQ pork bahn mi and was amazed. This is a great spot with friendly service and amazing food.  Do yourself a favor and try it out!   A quick search of Yelp for bahn mi near my job lead me to Crispy Bahn Mi.  I stopped in today for lunch.  There was no line or wait at 11:00 on a Tuesday.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The inside had a good amount of seating and looked bright and clean.  My sandwich was ready quickly.  While I drive to the park in Park to enjoy the sandwich, I look forward to eating at Crispy Bahn Mi next time.  With Bahn Mi in the name you would expect a great sandwich, and that is exactly what you get.  The grilled chicken Bahn mi was exceptional.  The chicken and vegetables where in perfect proportion.  The sandwich was a great size and perfect for my lunch.  Everything was fresh with perfect crisp in the vegetables.  If I had to pick one thing to change, I would have liked a little more cilantro and another jalape√±o. The way it was was great this is just a personal preference.  Honestly, at $4.50 this was an incredible lunch.  I look forward to eating here frequently and trying the pork as well as the chicken.  My lunch was perfect and I am glad I stopped in today.  Many more happy lunches to come."}
{"text":"If you have 30 minutes to wait then by all means. The food is ok. Can't be picky as there's not a lot of place that sells banh mi in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gawd. One of my favorite places on earth is Crispy Banh Mi! Their menu is wonderful, literally everything on it is amazing! We go a bit overboard every time we go ordering at least 3 sandwiches a piece but it's hard not to! They're by no means small sandwiches... awkward... we just eat a lot!   Highly recommend and obviously we will be back!"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese sandwich in Charlotte with nice selection of drink desserts! The grilled pork Bahn me comes in crispy toasty and soft on the inside buns filled with flavorful season pork dressed with carrots and cucumber pickles and fragrant cilantro. My favorite drink is the lychee green tea with boba, jello and basil seeds."}
{"text":"Recently moved here from California and was missing some good Banh Mi.  Crispy Banh Mi did not disappoint!  Fast service, the meat was seasoned well, bread was just how I wanted it to be."}
{"text":"Being from California and having my fair share of banh mi sandwiches made me hesitant about the quality of Crispy Banh Mi but I am so happy that I gave this place a try!   It is definitely now my go-to place for a banh mi craving. I've tried two of their banh mi, the crispy special and the grilled pork, both of which are delicious! The meat is well marinaded and juicy and the pickled veggies on top are the perfect complement to the flavor of the meats.   The dessert drinks are also pretty authentic to the ones I've had in the bay are and LA. Very refreshing and delicious!   I've been back twice this week and will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"I would love this place except is friggin closed the majority of the times I come here. I have to drive a bit to get here then to find out they are closed for a month at a time. Come on!"}
{"text":"I tried Crispy Banh Mi, per the recommendation of a friend.   The staff are super friendly and exude the hospitality that one should find at a new business. Each person was treated as a new customer! The cashier made great recommendations, sharing the menu favorites.   In addition to great food, I appreciate the fact that this location has ample parking to accommodate seating of the space. It's a small, quick dine-in space, but the designers did a great job laying out the space. I would not recommend it for large groups. However, if I were Crispy, I would certainly consider adding a patio area (hint, hint).   The sandwich was a perfect light lunch bite for those who are light eaters...well proportioned with seasoned meat, pickles and the right amount of heat. The strawberry green tea is a perfect pairing to cool down the heat of the jalape√±o.   Crispy has moved into my top Banh Mi spot!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Crispy! Of the Banh Mi places that I have tried in Charlotte, Crispy is easily my favorite.   So far I've tried the #1, #4 and #12...#12 is my favorite as I tend to trend more towards a pescatarian diet. They use tilapia which is fried crispy and well seasoned. When paired with the crispy bun, the spice of jalape√±os and coolness of pickled toppings, it is a very unexpected level of delicious.   If you're not a fan of pork, Crispy offers chicken and a vegetarian option.   If that's not enough to convince you, there's a list of refreshing drink options from smoothies, fruit teas and fresh lemonades. Plus, the customer service is always superb at Crispy at either location.  Heads up...both locations are quite small. I would not recommend either for groups but don't let that deter you from trying the best Banh mi in town!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to spot, tucked back in a strip mall down South Blvd, but I suggest you seek it out!   First off, I felt you got a lot of sandwich for the price! The woman working the counter was welcoming and patient with all of our questions. I ordered the vegetarian sandwich and fresh rolls. They make their own meat substitute, sort of like a seitan. It was good, but I kind of wished there had been a tofu or egg option as well. Both items were well flavored and tasty. I brought a friend who'd never had Banh Mi before and he was told me as we left that we were definitely going to add this to our lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"For a delicious and cheap sandwich then look no further. Unless you want to drive to Le's which really the best in Charlotte.   My bahn mi was the bbq Pork bahn mi was very flavorful and included yummy fresh pickled veggies.   My Pork summer roll was also so tasty."}
{"text":"This place is effing delicious.  I love Banh Mi, and I really love this place.  I'm not willing to say that it's 'better' than the Banh Mi spot in the abandoned mall off of N. Tryon (the one that was converted into an Asian-themed mall on the downlow), but it's just as good and much more convenient.  Also, the ladies that work here are super sweet (Hey Ladies)."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ and grilled pork bahn mi and both were excellent. French bread was light, crunchy and fresh as were the veggies inside. A kick from the jalape√±o and freshness from the cilantro.  Can't beat it for $4.25."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We went to Vietnam earlier this year, and the food here is just as good if not better than the food we had there. It is very casual, but it is family owned, and service is great. They even make a ton of juices as well as really good Thai tea. Their sugarcane juice even uses real sugar cane. I posted a picture of this."}
{"text":"For my first visit...and my very first banh mi sandwich...ever...I was impressed!   I'd read through some  previous reviews and knew I wanted to try Crispy's Favorite sandwich - it comes with grilled chicken, ham, pork roll and cheese.   It was everything I expected and more! I loved the roll, and the combination of meats and fresh veggies! I also tried the egg rolls. Totally worth it!   I'm looking forward to trying their smoothies on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Yea!!  A great alternative to Le's Sandwich shop on N. Tryon!!  Had the #1 and #4 banh mi sandwiches - we liked #4 - Grilled Pork - better.  Bread was on point for a banh mi, veggies were awesome and the meat was plentiful.  Can't wait to try other entrees on the menu as well as some bubble tea - FINALLY some close by.  Place was busy (Saturday lunch), staff was friendly, prices are excellent.  So glad to have this place nearby!!"}
{"text":"sandwiches were delicious. so grateful for this spot on the south side of town. great coffee. nice, clean and friendly. will return soon."}
{"text":"New Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwich and cafe place in town. They're fairly new so I think there are still a lot of kinks that need to be worked out. Not a bad problem to have, but they had way more customers than they were able to handle. It all felt very unorganized. Again, recently opened so I understand.   Coming from a Vietnamese family and having had my fair share of Banh Mi, I didn't feel Crispy Banh Mi was up to par. I tried the classic, grilled pork, pork meatball, shredded pork and grilled chicken. The sandwiches were decent, but did not taste very authentic. All of the ingredients were there, but not so much the right flavor. Nonetheless, it was a decent meal for about $5 per person. I will give Crispy another try once they're established, but for now I will stick to Le's Sandwiches in the broken parking lot.   P.S. Highly recommend the dessert drinks! Combination #1 was delicious!"}
{"text":"You've checked in here 11 times! What keeps you coming back?  Yelp has been yelling at me so I thought now is the time to write my Crispy Banh Mi review.  There are many reasons why I love Crispy Banh Mi, first of all, I love their hours, they open at 9a most mornings.  And their Thai Iced tea reminds me of tea carts on the streets of Bangkok, minus the bees.  Their menu is pretty straightforward but it seems like there's always something new to try.  I haven't even ventured to try other teas, because I'm too obsessed with Thai Iced tea.    Service is always pleasant and efficient, prices are excellent.  My only complaint is sometimes it's like a saltlick on the sandwiches, not enough to stop me from eating tho'. And certainly I keep returning!  I even have Billy hooked now! #billywillyoubanhmisomething"}
{"text":"First off, I was so excited to learn about this place through Instagram. Thankfully now I don't have to drive far to get me a b√°nh m√¨.   Second, I have nothing bad to say about my experience. It was so great! All the employees there were SO nice and friendly and I really appreciated that. I ordered the grilled pork b√°nh m√¨ and a Thai tea with boba. First off the Thai tea was made perfectly, the boba was cooked right and they put the right proportion of milk and tea in my cup. It definitely tasted very fresh.  The pork b√°nh m√¨ was also very very good. For $4.50 you can't beat how much you get, so you definitely get your money's worth. It was made in a good amount of time and it was hot when I got it. My first bite was not disappointing. The bread was good and the meat with the vegetables really balanced each other out.   Will definitely be here more often!"}
{"text":"We love going here and I've been experiencing cravings once a week!  Family owned business that's super friendly and fast. My go to for my taro bubble tea addiction and loving the freshness of their sandwiches.  Great full meal for under $10!"}
{"text":"Best in town and I'm a Bahn Mi fanatic. Yes, Lee's is in the same league, but for me they will the race by less than a furlong..."}
{"text":"Be careful not to miss this place as you drive by. It's a fabulous banh mi place and very reasonably priced. We had the BBQ pork sandwich and it was excellent. Pork Was tender and the veggies were crisp. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great banh mis! I like the crispys favorite but the grilled pork or cold cut are both equally tasty!"}
{"text":"Love their cold cut and fried pork banh mi  Also the boba milk tea are delicious. Good customer service."}
{"text":"As you can tell from the reviews, this place is a very welcome addition to the area. In all fairness, I didn't realize this part of town had a huge demand for Banh Mi sandwiches. Either way, Crispy Banh Mi is putting out a high quality product for a very reasonable price.  My original love for the Banh Mi sandwich was planted with Le's, but now I can get the same product with a small fraction of the travel and no WWII style potholes. The space is a clean one and the staff are friendly. I've tried several of the sandwiches, the BBQ pork is my favorite. In the end I don't think you can go wrong. I also had the summer rolls (courtesy of my wife's suggestion) and they were good as well.  In the end you walk out with a full bag of food and your mouth watering uncontrollably for minimal impact on your wallet. Also everyone keeps talking about the teas. I'll have to try one next time. Pro tip - if you are carrying out, order online from their website so you don't have to wait - they take future orders as well."}
{"text":"Today was their grand opening..so impressed with how fresh the sandwiches tasted and how friendly the staff were. The prices are also very affordable which is a plus... 10 in sandwich for 4.50! We will be back considering its right down the road from us."}
{"text":"My DH picked up a vegetarian sandwich for me and it was great!  My kids got a chicken sandwich and a lychee smoothie with boba.  All was enjoyed, I am sure we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place before we went to the Charlotte Hornets game and we were not disappointed.  Me and my fianc√©e ordered the grilled pork and Thai tea with boba and it was fantastic!  The prices are also very affordable!"}
{"text":"WHERE HAS BANH MI BEEN ALL MY LIFE?! I'm sorry, but how is this sandwich only $5?? This is easily one of my favorite lunch spots. I love getting the grilled chicken Banh Mi with veggies inside and the bread crispy. Vietnamese coffee to go with it and IT IS PERFECTION!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast and cheap! My only issue is that I came back for more on a Monday and found out they're not open that day of the week :("}
{"text":"Good  banh mi and passable noodle bowl.  Good lunch traveling through the state, much better than fast food."}
{"text":"One of the hardest parts about moving cross country to a new city is leaving your old food go-to's behind and finding new ones. This place won me over in two bites and has been added to my new favorites. I had the bbq pork sandwich...so good y'all. The pork was flavorful, veggies were crisp, cilantro was on point, and the bread was perfect! So glad we stopped in to check this place out!"}
{"text":"The Crispy favorite sandwich is good. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the staff is super nice. My latte was superb. I stumbled up on this place and I am very happy with it. I will be back and recommend it to others that want a break from the norm.Their coffees and Tea will give Starbucks a run for the money and half the price."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've had the egg rolls, the vermicelli bowl special, bahn mi and my favorite, the green tea with jellies!!! The food is good.  The service here is great! The lady said that it's not on the menu but they also have grilled chicken and pork salad. Don't sleep on this place!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened. Sandwiches are DELICIOUS and such a nice departure from the everyday American cuisine we are used to.  Jalape√±os can be a little zippy so order them on the side of you are sensitive to heat. Staff is super friendly. Cool little lunch spot."}
{"text":"Yum! Happy to have these guys in the neighborhood and even happier to know they're open on Wednesdays (cough cough Le's). The lady at the counter was super friendly and thoroughly explained the menu to us. I got the #4, grilled pork, and was super happy with it! Glad to see folks who are so passionate about what they create!"}
{"text":"With bahn mi it is all about the bread. Here is is perfect. Fluffy inside, super crust that cracks when you bite in and yet doesn't crumble apart. Generous helping of Chris veggies.  We tried grilled pork and pork meatball.  Crisp pieces of savory pork, marinated carrots, fresh jalapemo pepper and onion make tastebuds dance. The pork meatball is seasoned properly; mild slightly smoked flavor. I was ready please with the fried tofu which was topped with nori and deep fried garlic. The accompanying sauce has a touch of fish sauce combined with a sweeter garlicky flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing, if I do say so MI self. Seriously, what good eats. Nestled in no mans land, this is a traveler's cheap eats oasis. The sandwich was great, (I got the chicken,) and the bread wasn't like glass shards to the roof of your mouth!  I'll be going back immediately to try their noodle bowls and other styles of Banh Mis. Went with one of their desserts afterwards, impressed!"}
{"text":"The Sandwiches here are legit!  They're delicious.  Made fresh to order.  We had the grilled pork and the crispy Banh mi. The grilled pork was so tender!  We ordered the quail as an appetizer, they were so succulent and tender and crispy in the right places!!!  Also ordered the strawberry mint lemonade and Mango green tea which is also worth getting, refreshing!  Definitely check them out!!!"}
{"text":"When I heard this place finally open, I was pretty excited. I have alway love Lee's cafe but the drive is far and the parking lot tear up my car due to the potholes. So to hear that there's banh mi place closer. I have to get on it.. I realized that they just open. So I figure I'll give them some time to work out the kinks. Went today at 4:46pm. Pretty empty. Order the grilled pork sandwich and a soda! Sandwich is $4.25! I couldn't remember when was the last time my lunch was that cheap beside eating at MickeyD.  Sandwich was grilled. Pickled veggie was good. Cucumber and cilantro was fresh. The grilled pork was on the salty side. But overall nicely done. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu.. And the girl who took my order knows her stuffs. The sandwich was done fast.. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Yes! They get the BAF award. My bahn mi was seriously some bomb ass food, forreal. There are countless reviews on this place so I'm going to keep this short:  The bbq Pork bahn mi was flavorful and I love that bahn mis include fresh pickled veggies. You're eating good and healthy food.   My Pork summer roll was similar to my sandwich. Just great. Will definitely try another Summer roll next time.  My lychee joint was really good. I liked the fresh fruit. Hard to suck up the straw with the ice in the way but that's minor. My dude and I got there in time for lunch before it became crazy packed. So I would advise for lunch getting there between 11am and 12ish during the week."}
{"text":"Today I skipped breakfast so I thought I'd skip over to CBM and give their fried egg, \"hangover\" sandwich a whirl.  Something was lost in translation 'cause my order arrived with both a \"hangover' and a Grilled pork/Tht Nng #4.   No harm.  It was still around only $11 for two sandwiches and a soda--pretty cheap IMO.   I will tell you what wasn't lost in translation:  that warm egg oozing onto the crisp veggies, perfectly toasted bun, and unctuous flavors particular to Bahn mi.  And, I wasn't even hungover.  I lathered some hot sauce onto one half,  and drizzled hoisin across the other.  Sweet and then spicy--a perfect pairing.   Since I now have a second sandwich I surprised my wife and delivered it fresh to her office.  Yea, sometimes I'm a nice guy.  Even got a \"you're so sweet,\" and a kiss, too.  Not wanting the commute to Le's on N Tryon for excellent Bahn Mi?  I say, 'Give Crispy Bahn Mi a whirl.\"  Your belly will thank you!"}
{"text":"I was on the lookout for some bubble tea, and I found this place which was a super pleasant surprise!!! Got an avocado smoothie with boba and it was perfect! Good prices. I'm sure their food is great too!"}
{"text":"I love Banh Mi. I could eat one every day. Seriously.   This place is fantastic! If you come here, you'll see. It's a small establishment with maybe 6 tables and 4 bar seats on the window. It gets packed fast during the lunch hour and many come to pick up and go.  They have a huge menu of sandwiches and smoothies. I don't think fries are a typical staple Vietnamese item, but get an order of regular fries. They perfectly compliment the sandwich. Recently, they expanded their menu to include a pork vermicelli dish (bun). It was good, but really, if you go to a place with Banh Mi in the name, stick with the Banh Mi.  The service is fast. The food is fresh. It's easy on your wallet."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here and ate it outside at one of the two tables. They offer great sandwiches on fantastic chewy, crusty rolls. I got the number one sandwich. It was full of crisp veg and fresh cilantro. Very refreshing lunch in the summer.  The summer rolls hit the spot with a tangy dipping sauce.  My husband got the grilled chicken noodle bowl.  There are tables inside too but lots of people were doing takeout. They also offer many drinks as well as smoothies."}
{"text":"Roast pork banh mi and fried quail? Lemme think about that...yessir. All. Day. Long.   The pork was good, bread was the best I've had in charlotte for banh mi.   The quail were bonkers. Served with lime and a container of a salt, pepper, sugar (and maybe msg) mixture. It takes some patience to eat with small, finicky bones, but it is worth every bite."}
{"text":"If there was a 6th star option, this place would get it! Twice in two days. My new favorite place, hands down! Fast, easy to to order. Get the pork crispy veggies inside all day!"}
{"text":"Ever since I went, I've been thinking about it and how I can come up with an excuse to go back. Sandwich is so well balanced and fresh. Crispy bread, fresh crisp vegetables, fresh cilantro, and perfect amount of spice. Also their coffee is to die for. There's not a lot of seating here... but you don't come for the atmosphere, you come for their bomb sandwiches ¬Ø\_(?)_/¬Ø"}
{"text":"Sweet sweetness!  Great Banh Mi!  Baguette was warm and crispy on the outside and chewy, yet light and fluffy on the inside.  The sandwich fillings were generous, fresh and delicious!  Even better were the people running it.  My wife mistakenly ordered the cold pork sandwich but instead wanted the grilled pork sandwich.  They immediately made her another sandwich (free of charge) and let us keep the original one which I will devour later on my couch in during tonight's Netflix binge.  Definitely 5 stars.  Also, the prices are very good.  $4.50 per sandwich is hard to beat.  Not one thing negative I can say about this place."}
{"text":"Update: Got the BBQ Pork sandwich and it was even better than the last. Extremely savory, contrast from the crunchy veggies to the very tender pork was outstanding.  Also tried the Strawberry smoothie with mango pearls and it was top notch, bursting with sweet fruity flavor. These guys work very hard to crank out high-quality food with simple ingredients in an unbelievable flavor profile."}
{"text":"It was really friendly service and the food was delicious. They use a lot pork in many of their dishes, so if you eat that be careful. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was tasty. The chicken wing appetizer was great also but it was bit over fried. But for the most part it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the durian boba tea. It has perfect blend of flavor and ice. The banh mi, a bit expensive comparatively to other banh mi places, but it's served hot and crunchy with a taste of grilled chicken.  The environment is simple and clean. I will come back for more boba tea and the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Bahn Mi marinated pork was out of this world. The young lady behind the counter was off the charts helpful. I will definitely be back and want to spread the word. It's not a huge space or super fancy, you can totally come as you are. Oh, by the way, the sandwich was $4.50. What? Totally fresh, crispy bread and the veggies were super yummy. Stop reading this and go! You are going to love it! Its going to be one of my new go to spots."}
{"text":"Finally burst my Banh Mi bubble today. As a newbie to Banh Mi sandwiches, I was excited to try Crispy Banh Mi. I've heard nothing, but great things- how could you go wrong with 4.5 stars?   Located off of south Blvd across the street from the Panda Express, I would have never found this place without yelp. It's located in a shopping strip, but you can't see it from the street.   I came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed! I ordered the chicken Banh Mi and split the eggs rolls(2) and a mango tango smoothie with my husband. He got the original number 1 Banh Mi.   Our food came our super fast and was fresh. The bread was crispy, yet soft. The marinated veggies were delicious and the cilantro gave it the perfect touch. Very refreshing. I also added Sriracha to give it an extra kick. For under $5, you can't beat it.   The egg rolls were ok, but I wish I would of got the shrimp summer rolls. The table next to us got them and they looked awesome!  The smoothie was bomb.com and the perfect match to cool down my spicy sandwich. They have about 16 different smoothie options so there's one for everyone.   I've heard the Vietnamese coffee and Thai teas are awesome- I'll try one next time.   Overall great place for the value. Not something I would crave all the time, but I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The staff are so kind and the food is great! The sandwiches and egg rolls are so crispy. The vermicelli bowls are good to try too. The milk tea  and Thai tea we ordered were tasteful. Very happy with my first visit. They did not disappoint. Ordered another Thai tea to go for later as well. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great service! Good prices! Fresh and fast! Even if you're not vegetarian, we recommend trying the vegetable rolls and the vegetarian bahn mi. I really thought they had served real pork and returned my dish! They also have a vegan option. Just ask the girl taking orders."}
{"text":"Nice little place for a quick bite.  The sandwhich buns are crispy.  Been a couple times and was pleased each time."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sandwich I hope to have.  All of the reviews are the point.    Can't say enough about the quality.   Will go. Back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Just like the name says, they have crispy banh mi!  The bread is crispy outside, soft inside, and the ingredients are tasty. I'm overjoyed to find a great band mi place in Charlotte!    They also have a very unique selection of interesting dessert drinks. Hard to describe for Americans. Just try a few. I'm sure you'll find something you like."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place 5 stars, but they are constantly out of the fried tofu more than 50% of the time, and sometimes they are out of drink options as well. The food is delicious, but I can't give this place 5 stars when they are consistently out of food half the time. 1 star for no food and 5 stars for delicious food when it's available averages out to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty! Stopped in about 5 pm for a bahn mi. I ordered the chicken and it was cooked fresh for me, served on a toasty bun with fresh vegetables. The jalape√±os were extra spicy! I took my sandwich to go and it held up well until I got home. I loved the flavors and textures and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by on a Saturday evening around 6 and it wasn't busy. Very plain inside with no decors as they are fairly new. Ordered 1 summer roll and 2 sandwiches, Grilled pork banh mi and bbq pork banh mi sandwiches, and a Lychee tea.   We ate in and the lady brought us our sandwiches and drink but they totally forgot about our summer roll (which was appetizer). We had to go up and tell them. The guy who rung us up had to ask the employee how many did we buy and brought us 2 ordered of summer rolls. He rung us up, yet he didn't know how many we got? So we gave him the second portion back, didn't want the employee to get in trouble.   The bbq sandwich was ok, there were plenty, plenty of fat. As for the grilled pork sandwich, that was great! It was tasty and you could definitely taste the grill. Nice flavors! I would recommend the grilled pork banh mi. The pepper is spicy, so if you cant handle heat, ask to leave it out.   The fruit lychee tea, I wouldn't called it a tea, maybe a fruit drink, but not tea. It was good but you have to drink it quick or the ice will dilute the flavor. It was small and almost $5 for it. Wouldn't purchase it again though. They also have this card where if you buy 9 drinks from them, your 10th will free, but heck! Of course you better do that, you overpriced your drinks. I'll come back for the sandwiches but not the drinks."}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall. Great food, fast service. The drinks and desserts are the more adventurous items on the menu. I had this one dessert with mung beans that I had to warm up to because I wasn't accustomed to the flavor and texture but it was delicious. Can't wait to come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time my family and I tried this place.  We ordered the pork roll, grilled chicken and grilled pork sandwiches.  We normally eat at Le's sandwich shop in Asian Corner on sugar creek.  There is no comparison between these two places. Hands down Le's Sandwiches are the best. The only reason why tried this pace was because Le's closes at 5:30pm vs Crispy Banh mi at 8pm.  I thought it was ok overall, but not worth the price for the size and flavor."}
{"text":"By the time I realized there were no jalape√±os on mine I'd eaten half of it and was too much in a rush to get to Asheville for a meeting to ask. It was good, but didn't realize how much the \"burn\" was my favorite part of a Banh Mi."}
{"text":"took classic bahn mi to go. i am originally from southern cali and had very good bahn mi and ok bahn mi. I will have to say this bahn mi was OK. the pickled veggies were crunchy and a lil more on the sweet side . i personally like it a lil more tangy than sweet. The pate (spread) didnt have that much flavor but again, it wasnt  bad. i hate to compare other restaurants, but will continue to go to my other  favorite bahn min spot.   ordered milk tea with boba and it was very good!  the cashier / hostess was very sweet and happy to help you."}
{"text":"This place is very legit. The taro smoothie with boba was flavorful and the boba was nice and chewy. I got the Thit nuong which is roasted pork. So good, bread was perfect. I will be returning before my trip back home."}
{"text":"I've been awaiting the opening of Crispy Banh Mi!  I ordered the grilled pork banh mi (my usual) and it met all my expectations and more.  I noticed the bread was way softer than more places I visit so that was a plus.  I also ordered the Mango Tango. Soo soo good!  It was a nice mixture of fruit and I topped it off with the passion fruit toppings. The customer service is superb.  You really feel welcomed and valued. I'll  be back again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Sandwich is delicious but I do wish the sandwich is a little bigger. I also got the Thai dessert and it's super sweet. I didn't even finish it. Too sweet for me. The location is a little hidden. Next time I'll try the boba milk tea."}
{"text":"For a quick fix in a good b√°nh m√¨ sandwich, come here! A simple menu to look at for whatever sandwich you want with the basic fixing inside a b√°nh m√¨. I went with Crispy's Favorite which I believe had pork, ham, and tofu (possibly, could have been turkey actually). I paired it with another order of Cajun French Fries and a strawberry green tea milk tea with boba. That right there could easily be anyone's lunch or dinner in one sitting.  They can also do rice plates which basically has all the same ingredient as the sandwiches. There's also an extensive drink menu for all their milk teas, smoothies, and slushees in which you can add jelly, boba, etc. at no additional cost.  The interior decor is nothing too fancy and gears more towards a casual experience. At least there's a TV with ESPN on it! Major plus. There's also an open kitchen so you can see all the kitchen staff working on everyone's orders but there's no reason really watch as they're so busy. Great place to stop by for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Everything we ordered was superb from the appetizers to the sandwiches to the dessert teas. The sandwich we ordered was the cold cuts with cucumber, jalapeno, carrots and cilantro. You'd usually think of a sandwich on a sub roll as quite filling, but these sandwiches are surprisingly light. My boyfriend and I split one so that we could enjoy the summer rolls and fried quail. So pleased to have come across this place. It's delicious! I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I'm glad they have a second location. Last time I got two Bahn mi: Grilled Pork and a classic cold cut. They were both excellent. This time I ordered a Pork Noodle Bowl and the Crispy Special for dessert (coconut, Longan,jackfruit, jelly, basil and lotus seeds. The waitresses are cute and perky. The service is excellent and they always have great smells coming out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian banh mi in Charlotte with the right punch of spice. Yes, I'm biased as I live in walking distance. I pretty much only get takeout, so there isn't much ambiance to speak of, but it is clean and ordering online, over the phone, or in person is always efficient. You can get all the staples here like fresh spring rolls and i don't know why it took my so long to get into the textural and flavor sensation of their fruity green teas. The price is right and location is easy, unless you are fighting south-bound rush hour traffic after work."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Of course, thank you fellow yelpers for letting me know of this gem.   Loved the freshness of their ingredients. Definitely coming back again.   Recommend the #4 Grilled Pork. It was very flavorful."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was quick and friendly.  Wasn't a huge fan of the fries that I got but the banh mi was spot on. Was in Charlotte for work and this place stood out. Glad I had a chance to try it out."}
{"text":"I LOVE that this place just opened! I've been satisfied each of the several times I've been. The staff is very friendly, and they prepare the food quickly. And they give such a great amount of food for such a good price! Makes for a delicious lunch or dinner! Make sure to stop by if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing great food really quick service and lovely people serving. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I love Banh mi and looking forward to going to this place on Friday too test the food and the bubble  Tea's this place just recently open so there might be some probably but you won't know if it's good or not if you don't check it out for yourself"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 grilled pork banh mis, the summer rolls, and Cajun fries - for $14!!!!! All were excellent! We left full and happy. Great flavors -- everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. Only critique is that I usually prefer my banh mis with a ton of sauce, which they had on the tables for self-serve. Service was great and food came fast -- if we lived in this area of Charlotte it would be hard not to come here daily!"}
{"text":"Crispy is my jam. Get the Grilled pork and a Thai tea with boba. You'll be a full and happy camper for less than $9."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sandwiches anywhere. Get the crispy favorite and add an egg to it. For dessert get #8 fruit delight with ice!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!  Awesome BBQ pork Bahn Mi.  Bread is crispy but soft.  You gotta get a Vietnamese coffee too!  Thanks for letting me charge my phone with your charger!"}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the best Banh Mis I've ever had. Ordered the grilled pork: it was perfectly balanced with fresh vegetables and jalape√±os which gave it a kick and complimented the meat wonderfully. The teas were great too. Had the Lychee tea and it was a great fresh fruit mixture. Will be back, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Perhaps the most delicious Banh Mi I've had in Charlotte (in fairness I have not made it to Le's yet). There several options for sandwich fillings but I'm a big fan of \"Crispy's Favorite\" but want to try a few more things because they all look delicious. Their smoothies (called Boba Tea at other places) are also really fantastic and worth it. I really like the Avacado but I'm working my way down that sizeable list. Make sure you ask for the flavor pearls that make these standout, or they don't include them. Always a friendly experience when I go and they have a punch card to reward repeat visits. A little difficult to get back out of the parking lot and near impossible if you want to head North on South Blvd, but it is oh so worth it for each delicious bite of that Banh Mi."}
{"text":"I hesitate to make any comparisons between my Bahn mi here and the one at Le's. They are both really good sandwiches. However, I really enjoyed the grilled almost smoky taste of my sandwich at Crispy. The bread, the veggies and some added sriracha?!? Perfecto!! I'll be back to try some of the other sandwiches real soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the noodle bowl to go and a veggie Banh Mi. Everything was fresh and tasty. I was surprised by the amount of protein in the chicken bowl - pieces of pork, a shrimp skewer and a meat spring roll. So much more than the other nearby Vietnamese places. I think I found my go to for take out."}
{"text":"Crispy Banh Mi can be easy to miss from the road since its located on the side of a shopping center. It's a small place with about 6 or so tables inside and two outside. It's a good place to grab a quick bite to eat or something to drink.   I've only ever tried the BBQ pork Banh Mi and it's really good. There's a lot of different drinks/ Vietnamese desserts. The sugar cane drink is refreshing and sweet. Mango Tango smoothie is also really good. I haven't tried the Vietnamese desserts yet."}
{"text":"Holy Christ on a popsicle stick: this place has the BEST SANDWICHES in the city of Charlotte.   Not joking, exaggerating, or laying on my common dose of hyperbolic fervor... nope, this place is simply the bees knees, the king of the hill, the big enchilada, etc.  and theirs Bahn Mi sandwich is simply outstanding!  So run, don't walk, to this restaurant.  Yes I realize it's not much to look at on the outside (or the inside for that matter), but the food is top notch.  While I largely stick with the famous sandwich in the restaurant's name, I've personally tried the egg rolls and summer rolls - both are very tasty.  And while there are a lot of variations to choose from on the Banh Mi front (chicken, beef, pork, veggie, etc.), I recommend adding the fried egg to your amazing Daikon, carrot cucumber and Jalape√±o goodness.  The egg puts it over the top!  So what are you waiting for?  Get over there and enjoy!"}
{"text":"After doing some taste testing and research, these are one of the best banh mi sandwiches available in Charlotte. I loved the chicken bang mi - it was so big I could only eat one half! We also ordered the summer rolls that were very good as well. I will be back to try some of the sweet drinks!"}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwiches. Located in a very nondescript location off South Blvd. definitely worth the effort"}
{"text":"This new Vietnameese Banh Mi in South Charlotte is turning heads. Location and value is outstanding... they have a ton of choices and do a decent job with the execution. I'm one that likes his Bahn mi a little spiceier, but overall they don't disapoint.   The service is quick and friendly, and their desserts are pretty good. I'm putting it in my regular rotation of lunch stops from now on..."}
{"text":"The vegetarian Banh mi, Cajun fries and Thai tea is the trifecta combo !!! Very pleased with the vegetarian option rather than having a tofu Banh mi as I tend to get burnt out with the typical tofu. Whenever I'm on the south side, I always make it a priority to stop here !"}
{"text":"We love Crispy!  Best deal in town for awesome Hahn mi sandwiches. Grilled pork is always delicious!  Summer (shrimp) rolls are great too!"}
{"text":"Want to eat one of Charlotte's best sandwiches? Only want to pay $4.25 for the sandwich? No haggling, no guilt, no skimask?  Crispy Bahn Mi is the deal.  You can get experimental, but just get the Grilled Pork - you won't regret it.  Your back up plan is the tofu bahn mi - they make their own tofu in house - \"oh, no they didn't\" - oh yes, they did!  All lemonade and fruit teas/drinks are also made in house and have this cute freshness seal which you then get to pierce with a massively wide Bubble Tea straw - pow!  Great location with tons of parking. If they can keep up the speed, service and quality of product, these guys are going to make a killing!  This may just inspire Le's to up their game and open a second more convenient retail location!!"}
{"text":"Different, unique, delicious. Also very nice people, which is appreciated. I would definitely go back. 2 Thumbs up !"}
{"text":"I've been on a Tea binge after trying bubble tea in nata jelly/lychee, and diced fruit.  I've had a banh pork before this restaurant but this one was the best yet.  It was definitely grilled, smoked flavored, and sweet.  I didn't find any jalape√±os in my sandwich but it may be a good thing.  I got the peach tea.  The tea was fresh but didn't get the lychee taste I was hoping for.  It was hard to find this place as its located with other shops and doesn't stand alone.  Busy spot but mostly to go orders."}
{"text":"This place is really, really good. I've eaten b√°nh m√¨ at a bunch of places in the Little Saigin area of California ( Lee's a.k.a. McDonald's of banh mi, B√°nh M√¨ Ch√® Cali, and my favorite, Top Baguette) and this place is definitely as good as, if not better, than all of those.   The bread is perfectly toasted where the outside is crunchy but the inside still nice and soft. The meat is well seasoned. I think they butter the bread inside to keep the sandwich moist. The veggies are really good.   The owner is super nice and service is great. Definitely hit this place up if you dig Vietnamese sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place has improved a lot since they opened. It used to take a long time for inconsistent food and I didn't feel comfortable recommending it.  Glad I gave it more chances because their service is a lot faster now. They finally worked out a recipe with their baker so the Bread is actually crispy and sandwiches are of decent size now.  Glad you guys figured it out!"}
{"text":"I've tried about 5 of the 12 sandwiches there so far and all of them have been fantastic. The pulled pork and classic are my hands down favorite."}
{"text":"Very good banh mi spot! They do one thing and one thing only and it is pretty good. Spring rolls were also excellent."}
{"text":"Discovered this place via Instagram. Had to come and see if this place could challenge Le's bahn mi as my Charlotte favorite.  Tucked away on south blvd, near tyvola, Crispy bahn mi, is operated by a bunch of smiling faces. The place was very clean, pretty full, and customers weren't doing much talking. Mouths were moving but no talking.  I ordered a grilled pork bahn mi and a mango tea. The order was made super quick and I ran off to my car to eat. All I can say is that I will have to get another sandwich before I drown this place my favorite. The sandwich was awesome. Crispy bread, delicious pork, fresh vegetables. They really know what they are doing here. I hope they stick around. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Glory be the day I discovered this wonderful place.  The roll on which the banh mi is served is an absolutely perfect consistency for the sandwich, just the tiniest bit less crunchy than a standard baguette.  If you order a hot meat for the middle, I had the BBQ Pork, it softens it even more as you eat it.  A true treat at a perfect price point."}
{"text":"Summary: Great price, great food and great for lunch.  Long version:  The sandwiches are great.  Had the BBQ Pork Banh Mi which was cheap, had very fresh veggies in it.  Probably the best Banh Mi I have ever had.  They also had summer rolls which was fresh and very nice.  The vermicelli was tasty but not amazing, the noodles were good and the beef on top was nice.  Finally had the Crispy Favorite dessert, which was nice and had a good pamdan flavor, it was a refreshing end to a refreshing lunch.  I think this is a great place for lunch, the seated dining area is small but if you are getting take-out its great because the food comes out fast and is fresh.  Definitely want to come back when I\"m back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was really good! The food, the drinks, the customer service, and the atmosphere. My boyfriend and I went here, and I ordered the grilled chicken banh mi and a Thai tea with boba, while he ordered the cold cut banh mi and an iced coffee. While trying to put the straw through the top of the coffee, my boyfriend accidentally spilled it and cracked the cup, and they quickly gave him a new one without any questions asked, which was really nice. Also the banh mi bread was delicious, perfectly crispy, and soft where it needed to be, and the Thai tea was some of the best I've ever had. So with that being said, I definitely recommend Crispy Banh Mi to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place can be tricky to find but once you find this place there are plenty of parking to park your car. I ordered the grilled pork and the veggie sandwiches. They were good, Its bread is nice and crispy but the veggie lacks some flavor. Its drinks are very delicious but pricey for its size. The staffs are so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend while we were visiting from nyc. Was not too impressed especially being rated 4.5 stars. We both got the crispy banh mi. I was going to say it's pretty cheap at less than $5...but there wasn't much in the sandwich, so more than fair pricing. I'm used to them being stuffed to the max, but this one just tasted pretty strange overall.  I will say the Thai iced tea was great. Not too sweet and pretty well priced. Staff was also very friendly...I just wouldn't go out of your way to come here unless you're passing by."}
{"text":"Yum! We ordered a couple banh mis to go and they were great! I was hesitant as these are a little more expensive than Le's but ended up being impressed! We ordered the Crispy's Favorite and the Grilled Pork. I would highly recommend both! They both had good amounts of meat and the bread was perfect!"}
{"text":"Weird location - but inside was really clean and nice!  The banh mi i ordered was super fresh - the bread was delicious and perfect.  Didn't love the eggrolls I also ordered."}
{"text":"Welcome to charlotte crispy banh mi, I would like to inform you that I will be visiting three times a week.  So let's start with the specifics.  Located on a side strip on south blvd, your first trip you may miss it but keep looking till you find it!  In a smallish place, don't be intimidated if the line is out of the building, it goes quick and that is pretty good indication of the quality of food they are serving here.  I would recommend the grilled pork banh mi.  It is full of flavorful pork, pickled veggies and the best bread I have had for a banh mi.  The bread is soft, slightly crispy and just the right amount of bread to meat ratio.  This sandwich and its meat to bread ratio are hugely important to the overall product and this place absolutely nails it!  My favorite part is they serve fries!  You can get a taste of Vietnam with a tray of crispy fries next to it!  The Cajun fries were absolutely perfect, crispy, a little spicy and perfectly cooked!  I love this place and I plan on wearing a path between here and my office!!"}
{"text":"The Vietnamese iced coffee is to die for! The staff were very friendly as well. I also got the vegetarian tofu sandwich which I really enjoyed but took the jalape√±os off of because it was a bit too spicy for me."}
{"text":"Ordered Boba tea, taioca bubbles taste overcooked. Also, it took them 15 minutes to make it and yes it was a good 15 minutes.   Also ordered Crispy Banh Mi, the sandwich was okay, but the chicken was a bit on the dry side.  Overall, the one star is for the crap tapioca, dry chicken and watching other people behind me get their food before mine (thought we all ordered the same thing).  This place may be close to my house, but there are better shops going towards the University area."}
{"text":"This is the best banh mi in town! I get their grilled pork sandwich every time. The pork is flavorful and the bread is flaky and delicious. It is also very affordable at $4.50 a sandwich! Please check this place out... it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Yummy Banh Mi!   Grilled chicken and their special were both very tasty,  made quickly.   Nice to have a go-to place for Vietnamese sandwiches.   They have pretty good looking drinks- but I didn't try them this time."}
{"text":"There's not a lot of good Banh Mi places but I think this one is pretty good for charlotte! I have heard of this place a lot but have never been here. It was pretty packed when I came and the prices were a little bit pricier than other places. However it is kind of worth.   They have several different types of banh mi ranging from dac biet to the sardines. I've personally never had the sardines but I definitely would recommend getting dac biet or this nuong. Those two are really good. If you were taking these to go you should get them toasted but have the veggies on the side so that way it won't be ruined when you have to heat it up again later.   I crave vietnamese desserts all the time (aka che). I got the che thai and it was pretty delicious. I would recommend getting less ice so that way you could get more che out of it.   Overall great customer service!"}
{"text":"Crispy Banh Mi is a neat little restaurant. You can get in and out pretty quickly. The Grilled Pork sandwich was really good. The bread warm and soft. The pork cooked just right. Tender and seasoned just right. Unfortunately the Vietnamese coffee I had was not authentic Vietnamese coffee. It was overly sweetened like it had a vanilla sweetener in it instead of sweetened condensed milk. The coffee was weaker than normal. I'll try them again tho whenever I want a very good Banh Mi"}
{"text":"This is a great place in Charlotte to get b√°nh m√¨ sandwiches. Are they the best that I've ever had? No. Are they as good as what you can get in New York City? No. But damn they are good for Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is my second visit. I ordered with the app so that made it a quick visit. It is a very small spot with limited seating especially during peak times.   I had the chicken vermilli bowl. My fav part was the egg roll, the shrimp, and chicken ... so basically the whole dish! It filled me up and I only ate half. I wanted another egg roll bc it was yummy and almost didn't make the picture"}
{"text":"Crispy has been on my list for a while now and I'm happy to report that the long awaited lunch did not disappoint.   A friend and I shared summer rolls, the grilled pork banh mi, and a special noodle bowl with grilled chicken. The summer rolls and banh mi were spot on! The grilled pork in the sandwich was really tasty -- kind of smokey with a wonderful depth of flavor. We didn't enjoy the noodle bowl as much. It wasn't bad, per say. Just lacking any bold flavors and it was kind of cold, egg roll tasted a little stale.    The cashier was super pleasant and personable. You order at the register and then git a number/sit. Your food is delivered to you by an employee calling out your number. Our summer rolls and banh mi came out really quickly. The noodle bowl took a little longer.   Everything was really cheap! My whole order -- summer rolls, banh mi, and a Diet Coke was $10.   While we enjoyed the majority of our food and our visit overall, I'm not sure they'll beat out Le's (banh mi shop in Asian Corners on North Tryon) the next time I'm in a banh mi mood."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were great! Service was quick and friendly! The only thing was the pickled vegetables were a little too sweet for me."}
{"text":"Banh Mi sandwiches for $4.50? Sign me up! I love visiting Crispy Banh Mi. The food is delightful and the service is outstanding. My husband and I love the Grilled Pork Banh Mi, chicken wings, shredded pork roll, and Mango Boba.  This restaurant is rather small, there's normally a crowd around Noon."}
{"text":"First time at Crispy Banh Mi, it's a little hole in the wall but worth a try.   There were a few things I was no so thrilled about...   I found hot peppers in my sandwich though I requested none.  I got Cajun fries when I ordered regular.  The sandwiches are significantly smaller than other places I have been but the sides help to fill ya up. The menu does not explain their sandwiches well so ask lot of questions.   Granted they have only been opened for two months, I hope they can stick around because the Banh mi's were yummy (only reason I gave a 4)...it's still a place I will go to for now.   Be ready to wait because they get busy and seating is limited."}
{"text":"Summer rolls are great, the peanut sauce wasn't creamy like I'd expected but delicious! I had the #4 grilled pork sandwich and the meat was tender with a smoked quality and covered in fresh carrots, jicama, cucumber & cilantro. Next time I've gotta try it with a fried egg! The Vietnamese coffee came already mixed, they offered me a topping of boba or coffee jelly but I'm a purist, I declined. They've got a huge dessert & beverage menu with coffees, slushies, smoothies & juices. They also told me they're gonna start delivering on June 1! Can't wait to come back & try more."}
{"text":"I gotta come back for the desserts and summer rolls! Came her last night finally after knowing about this place for the last 6 months or so. I got the grilled pork banh mi and milk tea with boba. The banh mi was good, but not great. I guess I am picky because I have had a lot of banh mi's all over the US, and this place the portion is not very big for a banh mi nor is its as authentic as I'd like. It's definitely tasty and the price is good for 4.50. Note that banh mi's should never be expensive, it's been my personal rule that if banh mi's are expensive they are not authentic. You may feel differently about this, but this rule has served me well. Some of the best hole in the wall places or even vietnamese grocery stores serves the best banh mi's. Asian Corner New Century in fact makes their own banh mi's in the grocery store in Charlotte.  The milk tea was good, but too much ice, next time I am going to have to ask it to be made without the ice. friendly cashier and convenient technology using square to checkout. Food came out fast, the place is clean. The only thing is parking can be limited so you may have to park further out and making a left into this store on south blvd if you are coming from the south is difficult."}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place!  The staff is always friendly. The grilled pork sandwiches and spring rolls (grilled pork & shrimptpork) are great and we always love their drinks especially the Fruit Delight. We are here just about once a week."}
{"text":"Hello - I will not be returning to this establishment. I ordered my food ahead of time and upon arrival, they did not have the food ready. There were 22 min between my confirmation email and my arrival, which was 11min past when I was told the food was ready.  Upon arrival the gentleman said they were almost finished. He lied. They rushed to throw meat in the heater and make my bahn mi and bun bowl in front of me. I addressed how I was lied to and how late the food was. This gentleman offered me a soda...  I don't appreciate dishonesty and not taking responsibility for your errors, especially when it inconveniences a customer. I will not support a dishonest business.  The food also does not taste great. The meat tastes like it has been cooked on a dirty grill, as it has that gritty burnt taste. I hope this place does not stay long, as the food and integrity of the establishment are extremely sub par."}
{"text":"Visited this place while in Charlotte for the day. Sign caught my eye and a proper Banh Mi sounded tasty.  Small fast-food type vibe eat-in or take-out place, with friendly and efficient staff. The manager or owner told me the place was pretty new and offered a frequent visitor card. Since I don't live in Charlotte, I passed, but we exchanged pleasantries while I waited for my to-go order.  Had the Vietnamese coffee and two different banh mi sandwiches to go. One was the house special crispy banh mi, the other was the roast pork bank mi. Wasn't able to eat them right away so they sat in the car for about an hour. However, they were still delicious, the bread nice and toasted and crunchy, with a delicious filling. The crispy was fairly standard fare with an assortment of textures and tastes. The roast pork was a bit spicier, which was to my liking.   Cool little informal place that gets you in and out the door fast, offers a nice choice of various delicious banh mis (including vegetarian), as well as different drinks and Asian deserts, all for a fair price.   Definitely would be on my \"will visit again\" next time I'm in Charlotte of if a location pops up in Raleigh."}
{"text":"Looking for something quick and healthy. Found both at this place.   Location-a bit hidden, but clean and simple inside.   Service-very friendly staff.   Food-tasty healthy and fast."}
{"text":"If you've never had a traditional Vietnamese sandwich, well, you need to try this place. A good banh mi will make you swear off Subway or Jersey Mike's or anything else that pretends to be a decent sub.  Husband and I cannot get enough of their sandwiches and we have zero complaints about it. The BBQ pork banh mi and summer rolls are so good I have a hard time getting anything else.  It's tucked away in a little strip mall but once you find it, you'll remember exactly how to get there and want to return frequently."}
{"text":"Really Good Bahn Mi. The staff was great - even split a smoothie for my girls to share. There aren't many places in CLT to get a decent Boba shake... Crispy Bahn Mi has it!"}
{"text":"Nice shop to grab a banh mi - or apparently noodles, but they are not on the menu, they are only on a small sign sitting on the counter. You can also choose from quite a variety of appetizers, including typical selections such as spring rolls or somewhat more unusual choices (at such a location), such as sweet potato fries. One note: Sweet potato fries, while tasty, are not the best with a banh mi. But to each their own.  The interior of the store is clean and open - if your only experience with a banh mi shop is Le's, it is quite a difference, but like that location, it is actually a bit of a challenge to find. You will need to keep your eyes peeled as you are headed down South (or up South, perhaps), and pull in just across from the Panda Express, at the Salon Suites. Crispy Banh Mi is in the long and low row of buildings in the back of Cobber - however, you need to go in on the correct side. If you park on the mattress store side of the building, you won't be able to get there (at least, not without walking around, and I'm not sure they would like you parking there)."}
{"text":"This place is a little difficult to find because it's tucked away in a tiny shopping center off of South Boulevard.   They have a simple menu. I love that they serve bahn mi and French fries (I didn't get the fries though).   I ordered their Crispy Bahn Mi Favorite which doesn't have a description on the menu, but it has a variety of the cold cuts and the grilled pork with pate and mayo. I also ordered summer rolls and a taro bubble tea.   The bubble tea was pretty awesome. It was a little small, which I kind of liked - usually, I don't ever finish them from other places. I will say, it costs the same (or even more) than places that serve larger ones.  The summer rolls were pretty standard. Not exceptional in any way. I did like that it was not overstuffed with noodles.  The sandwich was a little crispy, but a little chewy too. I was disappointed in the texture of the bread. The ratio of fillings to bread was great, the meats were tasty and the vegetables were nice (personally, a couple more sprigs of cilantro would have been great, but I like a lot of cilantro). Overall a decent sandwich that could have been a great sandwich if the bread had a better texture. I will say that I ordered the food to go, so it could be the bread would have been awesome if I ate it there. I might try that next time."}
{"text":"Small place tucked inside of a strip mall right before Pep Boys. Awesome bread - fluffy inside with crisp and light outside - filled with BBQ pork and fresh veg. What more could I want? Maybe a little mayo? Only downside was that by the end of my sandwich, I was feeling a bit dry but I wanted another one! I finished my husband's grilled chicken sandwich. We also got fries which were standard; hot and crunchy. I ordered a Thai tea - milky and sweet and like community manager Nikki said, \"they've got the good ice!\" Good lunch under $20 for two people on South Blvd."}
{"text":"Somewhat tucked away in the Madison Park section of South Blvd, Crispy Banh Mi makes a splash in South Charlotte. The immediate location does not offer any fancy amenities or shopping, but Crispy can provide a quick, easy, and mainly affordable offering of banh mi's, soups, appetizers and boba/bubble teas and smoothies. The interior isn't meant for service, with only a few tables and a high top bar, so you can grab a delicious and fresh banh mi for $5, well worth the price.  I've had the BBQ pork and the grilled pork ones and prefer the latter just slightly. Much easier than going up to Le's Sandwiches for us, so glad to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best banh mi sandwiches I've ever had. I ate here twice this week. First by myself and next with my husband. It was still as good and my husband wanted to take a sandwich to go. Awesome customer service and great prices!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's definitely on the forever list of options for the Charlotte area.   They have a variety of banh mi, ranging from the authentic real stuff to all the other weird ones. They eve have a veggie one that, instead of tofu, has some kind of wheat meat sub. That might sound weird, but trust me when I say that Asians make really good faux meat substitutes. If there's not enough animal protein in that for you, you can also add a fried egg.   My favorite is their dessert drinks. They have all the traditional hits like basil seed, lotus seed, pandan jelly, grass, jelly, lychee, and even a delightful cruncy red water chestnut.  I sometimes just get their drinks.   My coworkers are big fans of the coffee drinks with the boba, so someone is always down to order... delivery.  That's right. They deliver to my work.   Have I mentioned I love this place?"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food and excellent service! The prices are also reasonable. Everyone who I've taken here has loved it, even the picky eaters who have never had banh mi. Lunch is usually pretty busy (understandable because everyone loves this place) but they're quick and call ahead/ordering online is an option."}
{"text":"I was visiting the area and wanted to try something different. This was a great choice that I found via the yelp app. Everything was fresh and tasty. The service was pretty quick. We decided to eat in. It was a really hot day and it was somewhat hot and muggy inside but not unbearable. We got the summer rolls and they were delicious. I got the Crispy Classic. My son and daughter got the grilled BBQ sandwich. My other son got the Cold Cut. We also got an order of fries and chicken wings. All of the sandwiches were fresh and flavorful. The fries were good but the chicken wings were bland. It was a good experience and I would go back if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"A perfect bahn mi is an art.  And everything about this bahn mi is perfect. Super yummy, fresh ingredients, fresh bread and it's the perfect amount of crunch and soft. Lemonade is super tasty and refreshing, summer rolls super good.  Def will be returning ^_^"}
{"text":"This place is three minutes from my storage unit. So, I am probably in serious trouble.   I'm a huge fan of Le's Sandwiches, but I'm not on the north side of town a whole lot. And, that parking lot looks a scene from Armageddon. Crispy Banh Mi saves the day by opening up shop on South Blvd! In comparison, Crispy is about the same price and also super budget friendly. Unlike Le's, Crispy does take a credit card.  My order: the grilled pork banh mi, egg rolls, and a Thai tea. There are all kinds of different sandwich options here (including vegetarian). If you can't decide, ask for help from the cashier. Personally, I say go with the grilled pork. You can't go wrong with it. As Jeff S pointed out, I like that the egg rolls weren't pack with a bunch of filler type ingredients. There's also an entire menu of coffee, smoothies, green teas, boba, and desserts.   Crispy Banh Mi is tucked away in a strip mall next to Pep Boys and across the street from the Panda Express. There's a handful of tables, so you may have to take it to go depending on how busy it is. If you haven't explored this area of South Blvd, go there immediately. Some of Charlotte's best gems in this 'hood: Burrito Factory, Vietnam Grill, NY Pizza, and Jasmine Grill."}
{"text":"Sooooo good !!! We tried the summer rolls, the vegetarian sandwich and the shrimp noodle platter. Everything was delicious I will definitely come back ;)"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with delicious and authentic banh mis!  Also recommend the avocado smoothie or any of their smoothies/juices!"}
{"text":"Small little place is tucked away with a few tables inside. The staff was friendly and helpful, but the food was the best part. I had the Pork Banh Mi. The food came out fast and tasted delicious!  I had been wanting to try a banh mi for a while and this was tooooo good! It was so flavorful and fresh. They also had a large selection of teas and other drinks.   Next time I'm in Charlotte I'll be sure to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It can be tricky to find at first, it's kind of a hole in the wall and next to a somewhat questionable Asian massage place. But, their banh mi sandwiches are delicious! I used to drive to Les for my banh mi fix, but they are far away from me and the parking lot there is pothole city. I love their Cajun fries and fries quail as well! They also serve boba smoothies and other items, not just banh mi sandwiches"}
{"text":"Very good food and fast service!! Banh mi was fresh and delicious!! Could have lil better table and cushioned chairs, so I can enjoy my meal comfortably!!  It's my first time, and I'll be back whenever I'm in area!!"}
{"text":"The bahnmis here are so delicious and priced around $5. You really cant beat it  they also have a large drink menu with boba teas and fresh juices. They also have freshly squeezed sugar cane juice. Sugar cane!! Love this place."}
{"text":"So I've been on on a quest for best Vietnamese restaurants throughout Charlotte because next to Dominican, Columbian, Panamanian, Peruvian and really any Latino cuisine, in general, it's my favorite. Lately I've been in a banh mi for lunch and bun or pho for dinner rotation. So on a Sunday afternoon I came to crispy and I was not disappointed.   I ordered the grilled pork banh mi with extra pork, Cajun fries and passion tea. I decided to take out because as usual I was eating on the run.   The sandwich was absolutely delicious. Super fresh toppings perfectly crusty baguette and moist, flavorful pork. The fries were shoestring cut with the perfect amount of seasoning. The passion tea was soooooooo amazing. It is as perfect as a beverage complement can be. It really made the meal complete for me and functioned  as beverage and dessert.   The service is quick, warm and friendly. Super eager to try their bun when I'm able to dine in.   Great little gem!"}
{"text":"The best Banh Mi in Charlotte, hands down. Terrific service, great staff and an extensive and varied menu. I come here at least 3 times a week when I'm in town and am always recommending it to friends, family and co-workers. I went to Vietnam not long ago, and I was surprised to not have found a Banh mi as good as this one."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always good. Staff is always friendly, I recommend the favorite and grilled beef."}
{"text":"This is best little spot. We always get the #4 sandwich but lately I've been trying the same grilled pork on a salad and it's great. The pickled veggies on the salad are the same as the ones of the sandwiches. My husband loves the pork and shrimp vermicelli special. The regular fries are great! I wish the Cajun fries were the same battered fries, because that would be great. I've only tried the coconut boba smoothie but I Love it."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I am not a fan of Vietnamese food.  I've tried Banh Mi sandwiches several times before and didn't care for them, at all.  However, this place opened up within walking distance of my job, and I always try new things - so I went in.  The cashier was insanely friendly.  She suggested the #4 (pork banh mi sandwich) and it was great!  I think this is how they're supposed to be made.  Everything is very fresh.  You don't feel guilty eating b/c of the vegetables (pickled?).  I am also a coconut fanatic, so I ordered the coconut smoothie with strawberry pearls.  That's awesome, too!  I've been back 6 times within 2 weeks.  I'm afraid I'll OD, but so far it hasn't happened.  Think I'm going to stop in again on the way home today.  Can not recommend this place enough.   Oh - I did try one of the desserts once and it was a little too odd for me.  The coconut milk in it was good, but the other things in there are just something I think you need to grow up with to appreciate."}
{"text":"Love the bread they use, as well as their sugar cane drink! I wish there was pho here!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive! We drove an hour and a half from Sumter just for Banh Mi and boba. The food was delicious and fresh. The staff even took time to explain the menu and the available options."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. I've been wanting to try a banh mi for a long time now so I was excited to see this restaurant pop up on yelp as a place close to a work meeting I had recently. The place is easy to miss and I passed it on the first try. Hint: it's in a shopping center right across the street from the Panda Express. Turn right into the parking lot directly after the Pep Boy.   I took a quick look on some reviews and decided to try the grilled pork and the peach tea. The service was awesome - everyone was friendly and welcoming (especially the guy at the register). The food was hot, fresh and ooooohhhhhhhhhh sooooooooooo flavorful! Every component of the sandwich from the pork to the pickled vegetables to the bun was pure perfection. I quickly and happily gobbled it up. The tea was also good. I'll be honest, it was really different for me (texture wise). I found myself taking a sip and saying \"hmm...this is interesting\" and then proceeding to take another sip. So while it was a bit different, I (think???) I liked it. No. I did. I mean. I drank the whole thing so I must have liked it, right?  I will be back!"}
{"text":"During my last visit , I ordered one of their drinks which did not taste anything like the fruit it was supposed to be . I asked to have it changed for something else because the taste was off , I gave back the drink to the girl behind the register  . I was told if I wanted another drink that I would have to pay, a smoothie just cost you a customer . I know you're new but pleasing your customers should be high on your list, any other place would just exchange the drink free of charge ."}
{"text":"This was really good, I had the BBQ Pork.  The bread is crisp and the veggies.  Someone complained that the jalapenos were too large but mine were cut into spears and not big at all.  The veggies were pickled so not soggy but had a nice crunch."}
{"text":"Baaaaasically I can always eat a Banh Mi. Bread is one of the joys of life and a crispy baguette filled with pickled carrots, fresh cilantro, and meat is a simple joy in life for under $5. Compared to the others I've tried this one was a little less amazing, but those flavors and freshness always deserve 4 stars.   This restaurant offers thinly sliced meat options instead of the larger chunks I'm used to where you can see the marinated flavors on the outside skin. The fresh jalape√±o slices were also intense so I had to remove them and just drizzle some sriracha for tolerable heat. Maybe thinner sliced jalape√±os would be easier to eat.   The location is easy to get to and service was super fast. They offer lots of drinks: smoothies, teas, juices, coffees, and then appetizers and noodle bowls too. I tried the jackfruit, lychee, coconut milk dessert drink with jellies and it was pretty good! Super sweet but I love trying new fruits and these were good."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place starting with a bang mi sandwich and ending with the dessert.  Banh mi are Vietnamese sandwiches with grilled meat and pickled veggies.  I always order #11 on the dessert menu.  See photo for ingredients"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the trip. Comparable to Le's in NoDa area. I recommend getting one with head cheese --always the best!"}
{"text":"I had the day off, so I decided to take advantage of that and check out Crispy Bahn Mi.   So, here's the thing: I wasn't really feeling a sandwich. I know. A Bahn Mi is a sandwich. So how did I end up here? I don't know, y'all. I didn't want a sandwich, but I wanted some really good food and I was not disappointed.  I haven't really heard anyone talk about the noodle bowls here and I don't know why, but lemme tell you about mine because I demolished it before I could take a picture. Oops.  I took the advice of the nice cashier at the counter and went with the pork. So. Glad. I. Did. That. First of all, the aroma was crazy. When I got home, my dog immediately came to see what was happening in my bag. Sorry, pretty girl. I love you, but none for you.   The pork was thinly sliced and deliciously seasoned. Crispy and not overly chewy at all. There were some cucumbers, carrots, diakon, lettuce, cilantro and fish sauce. All of the veggies tasted *very* fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't get the egg roll this time, but I think it would be an amazing complement to the bowl, so I'm definitely in for next time."}
{"text":"Better then any other place in town. Fresh, friendly, authentic, and cheap. What else can you wish for."}
{"text":"Best little spot you will ever find. Though you won't find it if you don't know where it is, because it's slightly hidden. I've sent dozens and dozens of people their on my recomendation and they ALL loved it. No ones ever disliked it, or said it was just \"okay\". Everybody jas gone back on their own multiple times. Their sandwiches are great. Vegetarian roll appetizer is awesome. Its vermicelli noodles, lettuce, mint, vegetarian \"meat\" all rolled up in rice paper, served with plum/peanut dipping sauce. So good). Love the cajun fries and the sweet potato fries (ask for the sweet potatoes extra crispy otherwise they can be a little soggy). I'm a vegetarian so I always get the vegetarian banh mi. Its a toasted baguette, with whichever plant based meat product they use (think tofurkey but soooooo much better), a delcious spread, like mayo. Then the sandwhich is stuffed with fresh slices of cucumber, pickled carrots, pickled daikon (radish), jalape√±os and sprigs of fresh cilantro (you can 86 any vehgie you don't want when ordering, of course). Also, they delicious frappe's (mocja, hazelnut, caramel, to name a few), smoothies and juices. Try the salted lemon juice. Sounds gross, but its delicious. The food is great. The service is even better. Not expensive at all. Go try it out. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We've never had a Bahn mi's before but these were delicious! The meat was well seasoned and the bread was perfect, slightly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. I wish this place were closer because it would definitely be a staple!"}
{"text":"*Update: third visit and the boba was not on point today. Hard and undercooked with zero flavor, not the delicious boba tea I raved about lasdt month. I hope they are just having a bad day and this isn't the new norm.   Yes!!!! This is exactly what this area needs! I have been in here twice now in the past two weeks and have been more than happy each time. The first time the staff were very attentive in explaining the menu. I appreciate the effort, but it felt pedantic to have someone explain what milk tea is or a banh mi. I was actually sort of offended that I was perceived as being either illiterate or culturally sheltered. I soon got over any sort of offense as I listened to another patron patronizingly tell the cashier how much he loves Chinese food. #facepalm   The milk tea speaks for itself...they make their taro base from scratch! Many establishments use powdered taro mix that comes presweetened and honestly just doesn't taste great. Not here though! They make it unsweetened and then add sweetness if you request it. Seriously this will now be my regular spot in town for boba tea. Boba is also cooked to perfection not too chewy or too sweet. My only compliant would be the small portion of boba the second time I ordered the tea. Not a huge deal, but something to think about in terms of consistency.   So far, I have only had one grilled pork banh mi here. It was a solid sandwich for sure. Great meat quality, up until I got a huge chunk of fat at the end of my sandwich. Not a fan of grilled fat, so I might be avoiding the pork here in the future. Can't wait to try their bun and some of their other drinks!"}
{"text":"Just a simple, delicious, cheap sandwich.  Wanted to head home to watch football, but alas, no groceries. We were excited to try something new, but damn they close in 10 minutes! I called to make certain we had their closing time right and he offered to put in a to go order for me even though they were less than 10 mins from closing. We were so grateful! They had already won us over.   My husband and I were recently in Vietnam for our honeymoon, so we were excited to try their Banh Mi!   First of all, the sandwiches are HUGE for the price! $4.50?!?! Dinner for two under $10?!?! Again, what?!   We enjoyed the pork patties and chicken banh mi sandwiches. The bread was perfectly crispy as were the pickled veggies. Perfectly done! I'll try the pork next time as everyone recommends.   There's also great smoothies, teas, coffees, etc. Extensive drink menu. I'll try next time.   Kind staff. This will be our new, quick, cheap go to! Give this place your business!"}
{"text":"Order: Grilled Pork. Vegetarian Tofu for the Lady. Two Waters. Vietnamese Coffee as dessert. And yes, it's basically dessert (slow drip coffee with condensed milk. Order it iced).   All of that was about $15. And delicious.   Thanks to Michael N. for his suggestions, they're spot on. This was our first time here, and you bet your sweet Banh Mi it won't be our last. There are a ton of other different options, a full coffee menu, a full smoothie menu, and a full bubble tea menu. Workers were super nice and explained everything to us as well, which we really appreciated. Go check this place out next time you're getting a Wiki Wiki car wash!"}
{"text":"Their vegetarian Banh Mi is slightly above average and would be amazing with something to make it less dry. Next time I will ask for some additional sauce. The cajun fries were a good side as well. I will try this again and probably bump the rating up to a 4. I have had better vegetarian Banh Mi at \"Me\" in Gastonia, but the price is definitely right here. The fresh rolls and tofu appetizers are on point as well."}
{"text":"Its a great little spot hidden away for a quick lunch. I hear the line goes out the door and you can call ahead. We went at an off time about 2:30 so there was only a few people. Prices great and sandwiches, I had the pork sandwich and loved it. will be back"}
{"text":"Location is hard to find. It's hidden in a sideways plaza. Ordered the crispy favorite to-go to eat in the car...bread was NOT crispy at all. Soft and hard to chew. So disappointed, but I still ate it. Can't waste food! Bread is probably better if I ate it there?  Passion fruit tea is good. Reminds me if the fruit teas they served at the Flammin' Crawfish."}
{"text":"This is a decent cheap bite for lunch on the go. The banmi sandwiches are very small and I would recommend getting a couple since each sandwich is on the lighter side as well.  If you're looking for higher quality Vietnamese food, this is not the right place. However, it is a great quick bite for meals on the go."}
{"text":"Based on its high Yelp rating we made a stop here for lunch. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. I've been to Le's, Doans, Vietnam Grille, CO you name it - this places Bahn Mi's beat it. We both got the grilled pork Bahn Mi and it was incredible. Great flavor on the meat and incredibly fresh vegetables on top, to top it off our food was at the table within 5 minutes of ordering. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Crispy Banh Mi has mad a few changes for the better. I love the sandwiches and boba tea."}
{"text":"This place is absolute fire. Me and a work buddy were looking for a pho/noodle/ramen place on South Blvd and landed here because of the vietnamese tag. Hidden gem. Definitely a hipster vibe, reminded me of spots out in California.  I've been three times and the Crispys Favorite is what I keep trying. It's like a Vietnamese bologna that is to die for.  I also frequent the quail appetizer which is a borderline delicacy. Never dissapointed. Been three weeks in a row. The online ordering is to satisfaction. They door dash, and the sit down vibe is not bad.  My friend loves the milk tea. Wish they would bring back the anchovy/sardine so I can try it."}
{"text":"I am in town on vacation and always up to trying different food. I found this on Yelp so figured I'd give it a try. I ordered grilled pork sandwich with egg, and veggie rolls.y hubby ordered grilled chicken and chicken wings. It was all delicious. I will be going back before I head home...I would of posted pics but was too hungry and couldn't wait"}
{"text":"One of the best Bahn Mi sandwiches in town!  Friendly staff and a great menu.  If you've never had one, this is definitely a good place to start."}
{"text":"I had their sandwiches and drinks couple time before, but they don't WOW ME. Mr. LE in Asian corner is way better."}
{"text":"OMG.....drop whatever you are doing and head straight to Crispy Banh Mi...RIGHT NOW!!! I finally got a chance to go yesterday and I am kicking myself for taking so long.  Don't get me wrong, I love Lee's Sandwich Shop, but truthfully, this sandwich is hands-down a solid winner!  The Pork Banh Mi knocks it out of the ballpark.  I really didn't expect it to be that different, but the smokey flavor of the meat is over the top...I didn't even need any dressing on it (I usually add siracha/may at Lee's).  I seriously think I will go back today!  Fair warning....it is a pain in the butt to get into the place.  I had to go back out onto South Blvd. three times because I turned into the wrong lot, but once I was there, it was worth it!  Just make sure you turn into the lot right next to the sign...don't turn into Pep Boys because it won't go through and the same holds true next door.  Also, starting this Sunday, 12/4, they will be closed for two weeks for a family event, so do yourself a favor and go before then.  If you do, you will be counting the days until they open back up again!"}
{"text":"Looking for something different for dinner and didn't want to drive to Uptown Charlotte.  I found Crispy Bahn Mi on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  This is not a fancy place.  It has fluorescent lights, it's bright and has basic tables and chairs.  Most importantly, IT'S CLEAN!!!!  Woo Hoo!  Got my food as take out.  I ordered a special Vietnamese vermicelli dish which came with three shrimp on a skewer, a spring roll, pork and a very interesting and fresh salad.  It was great and only $12.  Wanting to try more, I ordered the \"Crispy Favorite\" Banh Mi sandwich which is only $5 and is like a foot long with very fresh vegetables, grilled chicken, and some sliced meats.  Very good and could have been my meal on its own.  Could only eat half after the vermicelli dish.  And finally, I ordered a \"Fruit Delight\" dessert which is part drink and part fruit (coconut, lychee and other stuff.  Drink it with a straw then eat the fruit with a spoon.      Overall I think this was very good and a great price value.  I look forward to returning on future visits to the area."}
{"text":"Sandwich was perfect. Absolutely perfect. The sliced meat, the creamy cheese, the crunchy vegetables, the cumbly bread roll, just excellent. I could eat this every day.  I also got a Viet Coffee and it was delish!  I'll stop writing there as you have all you need: \"Bahn Mi sandwich.\""}
{"text":"I stopped in hungry for dinner.  While I was prompted to try one of their sandwiches, I was looking for something different.  I settled on a chicken noodle bowl.  I was promptly advised that this was not a soup.  The bowl was ready in less than 10 minutes.  The chicken was seasoned well, sliced, and served with rice noddles, cucumbers, daikon (a sweet crunch vegetable), and lettuce and carrots.  The fish sauce, used as a dressing, had a nice favor to it.  The dish was right up my alley and was filling but would likely leave room for dessert for someone who eats a lot more than me.   The restaurant serves a variety of smoothies (diary based) and slushies (juice based), and a wide variety of desserts.  The photos are quite interesting and perhaps, I will try one when I am in the area on a hot day."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious! Love the Banh Mi with grilled pork - meat is plentiful, grilled to perfection and seasoned perfectly! Don't wait to try it - some days they sell out of it. Another awesome item would be their chicken wings - finger licking good. My husband who's typically not a fan of fried wings loved it! Customer service is always superb as well! Try some of their refreshing desserts as well - goes well with these hot summer temperatures! My favorite is the rainbow one!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was really good, the staff were very friendly, and there seemed to be an extremely wide variety of tasty bubble tea flavors. I'll be stopping by again soon!"}
{"text":"We love this shop! Great Banh Mis and delicious bubble tea. Trying the noodle bowl for the first time today."}
{"text":"Delicious affordable vegetarian meal! I had the vegetarian banh mi and the veggie spring rolls. My friends had a variety of meat dishes and loved theirs too! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Banh Mi in Charlotte. I usually get their Classic Cold Cut. The portions are just right but I wish they would lather more of that butter or mayo sauce that they spread on the bread.   Today, I gave their Special Noodle Bowl a try. I was a little disappointed (which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5). The egg roll was overfried so I couldn't enjoy the egg roll as much. The marinated beef was delicious as it was very flavorful as they are in the banh mi sandwiches. The portion was much smaller than what they advertise at the store. I thought it would be the same portion like the ones they serve at restaurants (especially for that price) and I had a lot of vegetables taken out. Also, the shrimp doesn't even looked grilled and it's supposed to be grilled shrimp.   Overall, I would stick to ordering their banh mi sandwiches and stick to ordering the vermicelli noodle bowls at Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"If Le's sandwiches are perfection, then Crispy Bahn Mi is really really really good. Clean, no frills space with lots of drink and smoothie options and a solid Bahn Mi menu. We got the Grilled Pork Bahn Mi and the vegetarian Bahn Mi and both were awesome. The Vietnamese iced coffee hit the spot and I can't wait to try some of their boba tea the next time we're there (milk tea is my fav). Drinks are a bit pricey but that's a small grievance compared to the overall experience. If Le's location creeps you out too much or you're looking for a fantastic introduction to Bahn Mi sandwiches, the Crispy Bahn Mi is the place to be. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of their South Blvd location and the Shamrock location is just as good. The Grilled Pork (Number 4) and the Vegetarian (Number 11) are mine and my husband's favorites, with fries and a boba milk tea. We normally get our order to go but the dining room was clean and nice. Service was quick and pleasant. Crispy Banh Mi is one of our favorite take out spots and we will be frequenting both locations!"}
{"text":"I got three bahn mi sandwiches from here and enjoyed them all. Very flavorful especially the pork ones. I also got a tea which was good. Nothing too complex, well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place on IG ever since Tonya has been posting pictures, but I don't find myself in that area of South Blvd very often. When Colin had to stop in at Advance Auto Parts, I had never been to happy his car was broken. Crispy is 2 minutes away! We came in for a late Sunday lunch and I had high exceptions. Located on south blvd. the entrance is on the side of a strip mall, kind of hidden.   I can barely write this review without wanting a sandwich. We ordered the summer rolls, bbq pork and regular pork sandwiches and washed it all down with a iced coffee ( obviously) YUM!  Follow them on Instagram and you will get addicted like I am."}
{"text":"My first time coming was yesterday and I'm back again today! It is really delicous! Everyone is more than friendly and informative about the menu! Joe the owner has amazing hospitality and I will be back!"}
{"text":"My running friends and I talk about Crispy Banh Mi while we run our 10+ mile long runs.  Some days, its the only reason why we get up and run so we can go there afterwards and immediately stuff our faces.  The bread, filling, fresh pickled veggies, and herb toppings make for a great meal.  The staff here is so nice and they make sure you have a great experience with their food.   You can feel the hard work and love they are sharing with the area and Charlotte and I'm glad to see they are doing very well.  Food speaks for itself here, try everything and anything... you won't be disappointed.  If you are super adventurous:  crispy quail.... hard to eat, but super good.  Any of the rolls are great.  My favorite sandwich is the Grilled Pork, but you can't go wrong with any of the choices.  I've had the Vietnamese Coffee (cold), and it was delicious.  Still need to try the smoothies, but they look amazing.  CBM shares a parking lot with a nearby \"newish\" strip mall, so the parking lot is brand new and easy to park.  I know the \"other guys\" are in the older Sugar Creek area where you may have to dodge some very large pot-holes... I think my car almost got swallowed up by one of them last visit.  I know Charlotte is ready and willing for more ethnic food places... Crispy Banh Mi is definitely one of the trail blazers!"}
{"text":"So I've been here three times and I've been enjoying trying different items on their menu except after today that may change. I've had a few sandwiches here that were very good but I was waiting for the right killer sandwich and today I found it - the grilled pork.   In the past I've had the pork roll and the classic banh mi but today I went with the grilled pork which I've seen before and it looked delicious. And it was. All the flavors married well together and the pork was nice and crispy.   The avocado smoothy is a regular item for me as well and I've had some of their fresh made teas. For an appetizer, I've had their egg rolls. Most places put a lot of filler in their egg rolls. Not here. It's almost all meat.    Top that with a knowledgeable and friendly staff, super fast service and great prices and you have a winner here!   This is becoming one of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"First time here... service was extremely friendly and the food not only was phenomenal but also very fresh! Too bad we are from PA and can't have this every day!"}
{"text":"My first visit - the sandwich was amazing. I got the #1 and it was everything I ever want in a bahn mi. Delicious cuts of meat, fresh veggies and perfectly pickled veggies. The bread was crispy, tender and chewy all at the same time.  And really what drew me to Crispy Bahn Mi was the fact that they had a great assortment of authentic Viet Drinks. I just had to get here for that! And they did not disappoint. You could easily come here for the drinks alone and never get bored. So many choices.   On our second visit, I went with the grilled pork bahn mi {which is normally my favorite} and it was just okay. Not my favorite. I definitely preferred the crispy's favorite.   I would pass on their spring rolls. These were just okay. I mean honestly, nothing exciting about them.   The chicken wings are super crispy and full of great flavor. They did not disappoint.   Come to Crispy Bahn Mi for their sandwiches and walk out with a drink too and you will set. Glad we have this place. Charlotte definitely needed it!"}
{"text":"Had a tough time finding parking this time, it was pretty crowded due to lunch rush. But in general this place is hard to turn into.   Loved the banh mi I had to come back for more. This time they were out of meatballs , so I settled for the grilled pork.  I was tempted by the dessert AGAIN! So caved and ordered one, told them about my last experience and they mentioned they may have forgotten the sugar. I will say, this time my desserts were delish! A great refreshing balance of sweet tropical fruits and textures partying happily as a colorful medley.   I can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for like a year also my family. But today I order 3 sandwiches and they have DoorDash delivery 2 and when I called back spoke with Aaron she said they won't make another delivery for me. Very disappointed because I been charged for 3 and only 2 delivered."}
