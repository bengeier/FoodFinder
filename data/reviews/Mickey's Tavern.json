{"text":"Mickey's is a great little eclectic tavern on the East side.  The food is great and very reasonable, the drinks are strong, and the atmosphere awesome (if a tad on the loud side).  I ate the Mickey's burger, which has deservedly been voted best in Madison.  This is a favorite hangout, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tied with Tattooed Moms in Philly for the best bar ever award! Just go... you won't be disappointed, and you won't need alot of money, either. Have some great bar food (the sexy fries will actually make you sexier..), free wi-fi (Spike!),  cheap happy hour drinks, and if you're a smoker you can light up at the adorable patio seating area outside (umbrellas!)...and remember to tip the staff well, they deserve it for always being friendly and unique.. it is a cash only establishment, so leave your plastic at home...Oh Madison how I miss you....= ^ {"}
{"text":"The outdoor seating is superb.  The waitstaff is always friendly, even if at times inattentive.  The drinks are strong and reasonably priced, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Great bar and atmosphere. Excellent food and drinks. Make sure to get there early because it is a very popular \"hang\" spot around Mad Town!"}
{"text":"One of the best bars in Madison! Great atmosphere, cheap drinks and often good crowd of regulars."}
{"text":"On a Friday night:  Cute, fun, cozy. The bar was pretty busy and so kind of slow. A band was getting ready to play and there were a few obnoxious microphone screeches. We played pool, and there were plenty of places to sit around the table. The drinks were strong enough for me! Love that they kept it homey and house-like."}
{"text":"I go to the Mickeys Tavern for the atmosphere and drinks. The former hotel, turned bar is as marvelous as it can get! Each room represents different a decade with the decor and furniture you get immersed in the time the room represents. The drinks are delicious! The staff is super friendly and helpful! The food... ah, the food is not just like any bar food you have experience. Once you try their super sexy fries with the lamb burger and you will never order bar food anywhere else. It makes you a better person!"}
{"text":"Mickey's does something weird to me.  Every time I visit I end up chanting \"one more drink, one more drink!\"  Obviously that never bodes well the next morning, but during that night I am having the time of my life!  Mickey's is a great spot to go out with friends.  They have live music, decent seating (indoors and outdoors), a pool table, and great food.  I usually go to Mickey's for a late-night experience, but I have also been for lunch.  They have amazing burgers and great bloody marys.  Their kitchen is open late, so I can eat sexy fries while I am chanting, which is nice.  :)   The decor is quirky.  Very bright paint, cool furniture that looks as though it was picked up at a thrift store, and a jukebox in the front room.   It can get packed during weekends, but I just think that creates more opportunities to meet new people."}
{"text":"The décor is very 1960s bar in your basement, laid back and enjoyable. The wait staff was some of the best I've encountered in a long time--not too much hovering, but their when you wanted them.   Their sexy fries were delicious, could have used a bit more parmesan but I think that is a personal preference. The rest of the food was solid. We had a steak salad and the Greatest Sandwich Ever (as it is so labeled), as my husband said of the sandwich \"I don't think it's the greatest ever, but its pretty damn good.\""}
{"text":"Four little friends went to brunch.   One ordered the tofu scramble and instead got the scramble of the day.  One ordered wheat berry toast and got sourdough instead.  One was disappointed with the portions. And ran out of water because the water container was empty for a good 20 minutes.  One was happy. Even though the service was slow.   Yes, the food tasted good. But it may have been too little too late."}

{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison. They definitely serve up the best bloody mary's in town. World's greatest sandwich is aptly named (add avocado!). Sexy fries are delicious. Importantly, they have good ranch here. Decent eggs benedict makes it a nice spot for brunch too. Fun, eclectic seating inside; lovely little patio outside. Only downside is they don't take cards, an obnoxiously common trend in this town."}
{"text":"For some reason, I loved this bar.  It just seemed so lonesome out on the end of Willie Street.  We'd often bike all the way over from campus to spend a night drinking here.  The bar is filled with Willie Street characters and regulars, and further back, there are a number of chill rooms with sofas, pool, and pinball.  It's well isolated from the more annoying elements of the campus and capitol square clientele."}
{"text":"Mickey's can be great, but sometimes frustrating. If you sit in the back rooms and it's not busy, there's a chance that the staff will forget that you're back there. Actually, I've had the staff forget I was there while I was sitting at the bar, too. But other than the occasional lapse in service, Mickey's is friendly, cozy, the food is great, and their beer list is typically very good. It doesn't hurt that it's at the intersection of two bike paths, either. One caveat - the outdoor patio allows smoking, so you might find 9 out of 10 tables taking advantage of that fact."}
{"text":"great local tavern. and i have to say it, since today is st. patty's day, it's not an irish bar. mickey was german through and through. his name wasn't even mickey! it was milton.  anyway, they've got good stuff on tap: guinness, futhermore proper, new glarus spotted cow, shiner bock, leinies original, lakefront's cream city pale ale, bells two hearted ale, and capital's seasonal. plenty of bevvie's in bottles; too many to list them all here.  (edit: 4/25/08: shiner is gone, in its place is good ol' pbr.)  they've also got daily drink specials and frequent live music. if you're into irish jams, there's a group that comes in every wednesday at 8p. the jukebox selection should suffice anyone's desire for tunes.  (edit: 01/21/08: irish jam is over at the end of january)  there's a patio in back with tables and chairs; and heaters for the smokers who want to go out when it's cold. inside are a pool table, pinball machine, and darts for those who don't want to belly up to the bar.  (edit: 01/21/08: pinball and darts have been removed to make room for dining tables.)  rumors of a kitchen-in-progress are true, but timing hasn't been finalized. stay tuned for bar-food-ala-janey (of lazy jane's cafe).  (edit: 01/21/08: delicious meals are now available! burgers, salads, sexy fries [slices of potatoes smothered with truffle oil and parmesan cheese], mac n cheese, pork sandwiches, and yummy soup.)  (edit: 4/25/08: now serving brunch on saturdays and sundays! they open at 10. excellent bloody marys, vegetarian benedict, breakfast burrito, salmon scramble, and janey's yummy waffles with peaches & cream.)  and remember, tipping isn't a city in china!"}
{"text":"If you don't order at the bar: don't expect good service. If you show up on Sunday don't expect to be served in a timely fashion. If the owner is around expect all the servers and bartenders to act nervously. If you order a drink expect it to be strong as fuck and delicious. If you spark a conversation with one of the hipster installations (at the portion of the bar where they park) expect it to be a sad veil of regret mounted by passe jokes and lame anecdotes about the city. If you order a special expect it to be above expectations."}
{"text":"I like Mickey's because what you see is what you get.  Someone had the brilliant idea of taking an awesome old house and putting a giant bar in the middle of it. Then they filled the bar with great Wisconsin beer. Then, they opened up the kitchen for brunch, lunch, and dinner and put delicious, local food in it. Delish.  Plusses - great beer list - fun atmosphere (laid back, kinda hipster) - good food  Minuses - this place is \"seat yourself\", so sometimes you have to wait for people to leave in order to sit down - it can get a little crowded (but that is only because a lot of people like it, right?)"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a neighborhood bar that's hip and trendy without trying.  The patio is a smokers paradise, in summer anyway.  They just added food and the sexy frites are pretty awesome.  I had the \"Greatest Sandwich in the World,\" as they call it.  I've had better sandwiches, but that wouldn't stop me from recommending it.  They've got a nice game room, a nice sitting room full of mirrors.  Another one of the bars that gives you a couple settings which allows you to get the right feeling.  They also have a lot of cool live bands there so that adds a little liveliness.  The lady who owns Lazy Jane's Cafe owns this place, so she knows a thing or two running a cool joint.  Gotta like Mickeys."}
{"text":"I love Mickey's in the morning and in the afternoon, especially in the evening on the patio underneath the moon.   Lived in this neighborhood for about a year, and Mickey's was by far my favorite place to hang out.  The weekend brunch is decidedly solid, especially given their awesome breakfast potatoes.  My husband and I would most often share the scramble du jour and the special breakfast sandwich-consistently rotating and consistently good.  I especially liked the specials featuring pulled pork.  I only ate dinner here once, but the pulled pork burrito I had that night was delicious.    I would be remiss not to mention the best feature of brunch: the rocking Bloody Mary with a beer back.  The Bloody Mary is hearty and spicy, and the beer helps to neutralize the bite and provides a clean finish.  The pairing is so natural and the Bloody so good that Bloody Mary's at other establishments suffer by comparison.  Don't try it unless you're ready to set a new bar for Bloody Mary consumption (and spend the afternoon in a blissful state of buzzed slumber)."}
{"text":"A dive bar, but a dive bar with a patio and above average bar food. Pork taco type things on the appetizer menu were spicy and delicious and the mickey's burger was also solid. Sexy fries were a nice touch.  Server was knowledgeable about all the bottled and draft beers. Only downside is all the smoking on the patio and the failure to accept cards (get with the 90s guys!). Maybe not the best, fanciest food in town but for a neighborhood bar- five stars."}
{"text":"I'm always comfortable at Mickey's, a pub and eatery with a quaint, casual and inviting atmosphere without the slightest hint of pretentiousness. Expect to find an interesting cross section of age, social orientation and race among a mix of white & blue collar patrons who tend to be friendly without being intrusive. Some engage in good natured, somewhat spirited conversations; most chat quietly in small groups. A dynamite juke box as well as entertainment on Wednesday and Sunday nights with an open mike adds a nice touch. Staff are capable and accommodating individuals who present a businesslike cordiality not quite achieved in other establishments. The pizza is to die for! (Just ask my wife.) Although we haven't sampled the brunch, we plan to do so soon. The other menu items that we've tried have been delicious and reasonably priced. Because of the smoking ban, I avoid the outdoor patio, the one place smokers light up . I'm told there's no sink in the Ladies Room which I would think would be an installation priority.  No question, Mickey's is unique and a cut above other Willy Street watering holes."}
{"text":"I love the homey neighborhood atmosphere here. It's my go to place for meeting up with friends and sometimes you will end up in conversations with friendly strangers. Drink prices are fair, food prices are fair and always delicious.  The only downsides I can find is that there can sometimes be long waits for bathrooms and the service can be very slow since it is constantly busy. But no worries, I just come when I am not in a hurry to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Not my scene at all.  I think it's a former home that's now a bar/restaurant/lounge? Very crowded and limited street parking.  Heard that the food was good but there was literally nowhere to sit let alone eat.  Also there was a foul odor."}
{"text":"First time to Mickey's and I wasn't much impressed. As other reviewers have stated, both the quality and service are inconsistent. I guess we got a bad night. My companion ordered a dry vodka martini, up, with a twist. Waitress wasn't sure they could do a twist (really?). Martini glass arrives with olives in it and as the waitress pours the martini out of the shaker, she  says, \"that doesn't look right.\" It was in fact, discolored. The bartender had used *sweet* vermouth. Yes, some real competence there.  Our party had to ask twice for water, and my second beer was never delivered. Our sandwiches were good, but the fries were nothing more than glorified chips. The $1 upcharge for the sexy version (with white truffle oil and parmesan) wasn't worth it.  I'm sure the regulars like the place, but I'd stick with beer next time."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork in town!  You have to try the sexy fries...and do it when you can sit on the back patio and have a few drinks.  The bartenders are usually crabby but the servers are always awesome!"}
{"text":"I didn't want my burger to end. The feta was the creamiest feta I have ever had. The staff were very accommodating. we asked if the one crispin was dry or sweet and they were not sure so they just cracked a bottle open and let us try it.  I can't wait to come back here. Lovely vibe. Lovely staff, the best burger I have ever had! Try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Locals bar, old school atmosphere. Great bloody marys and breakfast."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Mickeys. And now with brunch on the weekends I really love it. Great scrambles. Try the tranquilla. Super tasty and good for a drink before noon."}
{"text":"Didn't realize that Mickey's had food, as the few times I've been there have been later in the evening or to see a band. Had  dinner there this week. Started with a Six Point on tap (they had the Bengali IPA which was great, though I'd love to see Resin on tap) and the green chile pork, which came with 4 soft flour taco shells. The dish was excellent -- both the sauce and the pork were perfect. For an entree I had the mac and cheese with ring bolonga, one of my favorite comfort foods. Nothing to over the top, but it is hard to go wrong with sausage, noodles and cheese.   My wife ordered the sexy fries, which sound much better on the menu than they were, I was a bit underwhelmed - I think I would have preferred the parmesan melted onto the chips, but still good. Loved the outdoor dining area, so I will definitely be back to try some other items.  There were three waitresses the night were was there, and service was great."}
{"text":"After a knitting group I attend had a really unpleasant experience in our last location, Mickey's has been our new, amazing home.  In addition to the awesome atmosphere, excellent service, and scrumptious food, they've gone out of their way to welcome us, even once baking us our own cake and having Jane herself come to tell us to make ourselves at home.    Mickey's is simply one of my favorite places in Madison, period."}
{"text":"Mickey's is really the only place in town that feels right anymore. There's nothing pretentious or phony about it, it's a neighborhood bar that is honest to the core. All the old fixtures remain, augmented by the wacky, thrift-store additions of the owner. Different times bring in different crowds. There are regulars at happy hour, a young, hipper crowd that pushes in during music shows, families and couples at brunch....  Mickey's recently started serving food and it's as good of bar food as you'll find. Skip the fancy restaurant and sample the menu here. It's good, locally sourced, lovingly prepared food that can be hearty or delicate - whatever strikes your fancy.  It's Mickey's. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  We entered and didn't really know what to think - seemed like lots of regulars gathered there, lots of people eating some tasty looking treats, crowded, maybe a little divey and a band setting up.  Some patrons at the bar shuffled around to make room for us, which was great and we ordered up.  I started with a beer, cuz I'm boring and only like light domestic beer, but I followed up with their special which was a basil boozy lemonade.  Quite delicious - the basil was fresh and muddled in the drink and the lemonade nice and cool.  It made for a refreshing drink on a hot night.  We only stayed for a couple since there was a band setting up, but had some nice conversation with the regulars.   We'd go back, but I would have a snack next time too."}
{"text":"I feel really unsafe here. It's well known amongst the staff that a bartender regularly harasses women but nobody cares : (."}
{"text":"Kick arse brunch Kick arse bloody Kick arse coffee Kick arse service Kick arse atmosphere  Only suggestion is that they carry a small selection of single malt whiskeys (Laphroaig, Caol Ila, Talisker, Glenlivet, etc)."}
{"text":"I meant to review Mickey's a long time ago, but even though some time has passed, it's still a great place. The patio is outstanding, service prompt and friendly, and the fries are super!"}
{"text":"A really good neighborhood-type place with fine bar food and great beverages at really fair prices. The outdoor area is great in good weather. Had some chili and a Mickey's Burger with sexy fries. Delicious, but this is big food and they nearly put me down for the count. Friendly servers who forgot one of our drink orders, but then realized it, apologized, and comped us with a round! And they were darn nice to my dog too."}
{"text":"Come here if you're not a fan of those Barbie mimosas. Here you are served a PINT of mimosas like a proper tavern. Pro Tip: get it with no ice = more mimosas. The OJ tasted fresh and not from concentrate, the champagne was a little more dry than I expected, but nonetheless delicious (who complains about a mimosa?!).  Oh the Bloodys. $6.50 with lime and lemon wedge, a pickle, and pickled Brussels sprout, onion bulb and a radish. You can choose a craft beer back, we decided on a PBR back that ended up almost as big as a pint.  They are busy busy busy, tables are first come first serve. Grab a mug and fill it with Joe or order some drinks from the bar while you stalk a table.  Eggs Benedict - Light Hollandaise sauce. Canadian bacon with perfectly poached eggs. The crusty, saltiness of the meat paired well with the quintessential eggs. Arrived with skillet, skin-on potatoes.  Mickey's Burger - one of the best burgers I've had around Madison. 1/3 of punch-you-in-your-face meaty goodness with spicy giardiniera and onions strings. House made slaw and kettle chips on the side."}
{"text":"First time in... Mickey Burger and Sexy Fries... Awesome!  Good beer and a patio...  If this was in my town, I'd be a regular..."}
{"text":"Mickey's has great food, fairly decent prices, and a kind of funky interior like Lazy Jane's on Willy Street. But OMG the waitperson we had the first and now only time I have gone in to have food there was horrible. It was 5/24/2016 late afternoon, not only did the waitress refuse to make out separate checks but also refused to ring us out separately. She got our drink order wrong, then our dinner order wrong, and then over charged us on the final bill. Strike three your out! And we were the only people there having dinner at the time. I've lived in the Willy St., Schenk's, Atwood neighborhood for 22 years, I will not go back to Mickey's."}
{"text":"Oh Mickey('s) you're so fine!  Good bloodies Good burgers Good beer selection Good brunch Good (b)atmosphere  Love ya Mickey's.  I only wish I visited you more often."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on Sunday and absolutely loved it! The building feels like it's someone's house that just happens to have a full bar instead of a kitchen. There are also a few other rooms to sit in or play billiards. The food was cheap and tasted great. If you are looking for a brunch place downtown this a great option."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! My partner and I have been a couple times, when we're craving a burger. I've had both a beef and walnut burger there, and both were unbelievable. The prices are very reasonable for the deliciousness that is the food. They've got a great beer selection and the environment is cozy and laid back. They also have tons of vegetarian options, that are tasty and not just the typical options you usually find. And, at last, the \"sexy fries\" are a special treat! I would like to try their other meals, which I would expect to be phenomenal."}
{"text":"First-timer, life-timer!!!  Went and played golf at Monona this past Friday and afterwards we were looking to grab some food, so my friend suggested Mickey's.  I hadn't heard of it since I'm new to the area and don't get to Willy St., so didn't know what to expect.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.    It's a complete dive bar from the outside, sort of your typical WI corner looking bar.  Inside there's a ton of character from this old house turned bar/restaurant.  It was the first night they opened the patio in the back so it was very busy.  Our server was incredibly busy and I was a little taken back when they said they didn't even have any more Miller High Life, but they had plenty of others to choose from.  Not a big deal.  We did have to go the bar to order drinks at one point since our waitress wasn't anywhere to be seen.   But.... she did apologize and was very attentive the rest of the night.  Again, just a busy night.  The Food:  This is where Mickey's really shines!!    My friend had their burger which is rated the best in town, so says he and much of Madison.  I had a green chile pork dish that is topped with Mozzerella and comes with tortillas.  I have never tasted anything like it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was very spicy and I loved every bite.  My other friends ordered these loaded quesadilla's (she's vegetarian) and mac n' cheese, and both of the dishes were impressive to look at and taste.    For a 'dive bar,' I have yet to find better bar food.  I highly recommend Mickey's Tavern!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, atmosphere  and service and a Willy Street staple! If they are busy and you are starving, you might want to have 1) have a snack before you go 2) go somewhere else. The patio is also fun in the summer."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with a great beer selection. One of Madison's oldest bars and still going strong! The night crowd tends towards the hipster and those who want to be \"cutting edge\" but don't have the guts to venture out into the world like NYC, Chicago or LA. Daytime tends towards more working class and grad students. It is as close to the old 602 Club as anyone will ever get and that makes it work."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: corner dive bar and pub.  Cash-only, a handful of tables, limited bar seating, friendly people, competent bartenders, decent food. Mickey's Tavern came off as one of those places no one talks about but everyone somehow wanders in from time to time. We arrived for brunch and sat at the bar. My Eggs Benedict ($8.50) wasn't great; the English muffins were burnt, the Canadian bacon was hard, but the eggs were good. The potatoes they came with were delicious, though. And my friends really enjoyed their omelette and breakfast burrito.   Even with my own disappointing dish, I'd surely return for the atmosphere, some drinks, and a different plate of food."}
{"text":"As everyone else has already said, the atmosphere in Mickey's is great. All of the different rooms allow for a certain element of privacy, but there is also a friendly, neighborhood-y vibe.  I got lunch there with some friends the other day, and had the \"World's Greatest Sandwich,\" which has 1 fried egg (over easy), bacon, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. For me, it would have been \"greater\" with 2 eggs and riper/more flavorful tomatoes. That said, the egg was cooked perfectly, and the bacon was nice and crispy. Also got a bloody mary, which was OK, though not great (didn't quite have that zing, you know?), though it came with a beer chaser, which  is always appreciated."}
{"text":"Worth the wait in line. The Scrambler was everything I had heard it was, and then some."}
{"text":"Cozy, lay back, relaxed atmosphere.   Ordered \"Mickey Burger\", deluxe, and build your own.   Burgers were delicious when ordering medium, but the well-done burger was just too dry.   Mickey was topping well if you like spicy.   Deluxe was average, but would go back to try again.   Overall great experience.   Would go back again for round 2."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar that also serves up great food. I've been frequenting this bar for about 16 years under various ownership. I remember when there was a baby fawn diarama behind the bar and when I went upstairs to go to the bathroom ( I saw a door open), I was chased out by an old man who lived there. I think it was the owner.    They've come a long way since, especially now that they serve up reasonably priced food. The sexy fries have been a fave, but the most recent time I had them, they changed the cut of the potato and they were overdone.  The pizzas are good too."}
{"text":"This place has a cool vibe and might be something out of San Francisco from the 70s is what I imagine. Very cool bar with a great decor and people. Is it hipster I'm not sure but I imagine it draws them. Barry white, smooth jazz, Dave Brubeck, Tin hat trio and Dionne Warwick plays at a nice level. You can't use the juke box before 10 pm so the house sets the mood which I totally love, some jack ass can't ruin the vibe they have going and play Ozzy or something like that. The back lounge area is very cool, see my pictures. We didn't eat there so I don't know how the food is but the patio was packed. I saw a the remains of a Bloody Mary pass by so I wanted one. I don't drink bloody Mary's, maybe two in my life but it was very good. This would be a totally awesome Sunday morning place after a hard Saturday night of drinking. See my pictures of the day. There is board games in the back lounge with a pool table which we used. This has got to be a neighborhood treasure to say the least and one very cool place, I like it. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way through Madison to canoe up north at the recommendation of other yelpers.  If I lived closer, I would be a regular.  This place is nostalgic and comfortable.  The bartender (might be an owner) was super nice and makes a mean bloody!  Sexy fries aren't just pretty - they have a little complexity from the truffle oil and the parmesan.  The burger and reuben were both solid and the wedge salad was fresh!   The skill of the kitchen folks comes through here...a step above bar food.  Next time I am heading North, I will be stopping at Mickey's and maybe we can stay longer this time...."}
{"text":"I'm gonna say this is not worth the wait even if the food is gold. I've been waiting for 45 minutes and there's still no food yet!  You really gotta come here with an attitude there's nothing else to get to.  Ok. I ate. I changed my mind. I will be back. BUT I will bring work or some game to play during the one hour wait.   Tofu scrambler. Best scrambler ever!!! Word of caution - if you're faint hearted for the oil, then you might not be suited for this deliciousness. There onions were perfectly cooked, the peanut butter brought out the awesome eggs and the spinach was perfectly done! It taste more like minced meat to me! Love it. Best scrambler ever!!  My boy's biscuits and gravy were good but I've had better. Biscuits were a little dense for me and the gravy a little too runny.   I took off a star for the wait. Not for people with little patience or things to hurry to"}
{"text":"Madison's got a little of everything; but really just a *little* of most things, and irish pubs is one of them.  There are only a couple, and this is probably the best, most low-key and most authentic one."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it but I had never eaten at Mickey's before. It is a short walk from my house. I have no excuse.  So tonight I gave it a try. I had a rail drink for $2.50. Good way to start. I asked the waitress for a suggestion, she named a few options so I tried the pork posole and the Sexy Fries. I loved the posole. The pork was so tender and spicy. There were raw sliced jalapeños on top. They were surprisingly delicious and the heat did not drown out the flavor. The sexy fries were excellent but I only could eat a few. They were very rich.  There are many items on the menu that I wanted to try. I shall return!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, fair prices, but over the last 15 years of going to this bar a few times a year one thing has remained the same - pretentious, unhelpful, cooler-than-thou jackasses behind the bar. If you're not a tatted up hipster be prepared to wait a long time for your drinks. But I keep going back so it's not all bad."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for the atmosphere and classic cocktails, it has that dive-bar feel but with a more classy retro twist, this place attracts a variety of patron which is my favorite part about it. Great drinks and the food isn't half bad either. The patio in the summer is superb and lots of great bands play here on any given night for free!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Madison, and have lived out of state for the past 7 or 8 years. But man, I have yet to find a bar I like better than Mickey's. I truly believe this is the best bar in the entire world. Every new bar I find I compare to Mickey's, and they all come up short. So why is Mickey's Tavern the literal best bar in the entire world? Great food, great alcohol. (The prices are especially great coming back to visit Madison from the coasts.) Great patio, it's wonderful to be able to smoke while I have a cold local beer. The inside of the bar is large with ample seating, and great homey decor. There's a pool table. The bar is large enough that if there is a band playing, but you are looking for a more low-key evening you can find seating in another room. But the real reason Mickey's is the best is how friendly the atmosphere is. I always feel like I am attending a pleasant party every time I go there. People are just nice. Not midwestern fake nice, but super fun to talk to if you want. But, of course, you don't have to."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Sunday brunch here with a huge group. We had to wait a little while to be seated inside, but it was well worth it. It's definitely an old house that's been converted into a restaurant with seating in several different rooms. We got to sit on a couch and a comfy chairs around a large table.   I had the tofu scramble (as did several others in my group) and it was pretty much to die for. I also tried a blueberry house kombucha with vodka....YUM!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to Mickey's.  I have been hear a handful of times.  The reason why I know this is a bar, is because I've gone hear with a couple of times with different groups of friends and they suggested Mickey's.    Never eaten, but it's been a fun, chill place to get drinks.  I've always enjoyed their beer selection.  You can always count on some decent WI craft beers, especially from around the Madison area.    The main bar area has plenty of seats, with some low-seating tables for dining.  There's another room with a pool table, and a great outdoor patio area.    Anytime I'm in Madison, I'm an easy sell to make a stop at Mickey's"}
{"text":"What used to be a perfectly fine dive bar has now been transformed into a cutesy neighborhood grille serving some of the most bland and disgusting piles of unremarkable garbage that passes for \"pub fare\" in Madison.  Whoever coined the term \"Sexy Fries\" should never be allowed near truffle oil (or a kitchen) ever again.   The decor, except for the admittedly cool lamps, back bar and wall art, is cobbled together from the discount aisle at Menard's.  It looks and feels cheap and fake in there.   The service ranges from surly and incompetent to very pleasant and incompetent. The staff, whether trying to be polite or not, knows next to nothing about either the food or the drinks they are serving. Boggles the mind.  For the life of me, I'll never understand why this place is rated so highly. If you want real east-side bar food, go a half-mile up the road to the Harmony."}
{"text":"Recommend the burger and mac'n cheese. Friendly atmosphere, good drinks. Sometimes they have live music going."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating area, I love to hang out here in the summer and have drinks. I was here a few weeks ago and they charged $7.50 for a Hendricks G&T. Yikes! Especially considering a rail is only $3. Watch what you order, I guess."}
{"text":"Mickey's is an awesome place to go to have a few drinks with friends.  Its both large and intimate because of all the little rooms.  It also has one of the best outdoor patios.  The food is amazing.  Excellent pizza and tasty brunch.  Try the Bloody Mary...its really delicious.  And the live music is always free."}
{"text":"Great bar.  Great food.  Good selection of beer - on tap and bottled.  I like having lunch in the outdoor seating area on a nice sunny day and I've seen many great musical performances in the bar at night.  My only complaints are that the \"stage\" area can get quite cramped and that second-hand smoke can be annoying when dining outside. The bartenders at Mickey's range from exceptionally good to really crappy. Please don't write the bar off if you happen to get a crappy one on your first visit."}
{"text":"my friends have always been big fans of Mickeys and since I've moved closer, I frequent it much more often.  I like the atmosphere a lot, anyone can feel welcome here from 70 yr old biker dudes to sorority girls, you'll find them all at Mickeys.  And I live how it feels like youre at a house party, with all of the cozy couches and little books. The prices are in line with what you'll find around Madison ($6 so co old fashion, $4 ale asylum beer) and they have standard bar food. Fun place, me likey."}
{"text":"This is SUCH a cool bar. Total Mad East vibe, come as you are, but with great drinks and food. Anything Jane Capito (from Lazy Jane's) touches turns to gold. I love the decor, too - furniture from your grandma's house, but doesn't smell like old folks.  We pop in here during bike rides since they have great access to a trail intersection. Good for night drinking and riding home with head and tail lights.  As with Jane's other restaurants, they don't take credit, so bring cash or use the ATM machine.  Oh, and get the fries. DANG!"}
{"text":"Love this place!   Who doesn't love a great tavern?  It was Easter Sunday, and my friends and I were looking for a late Easter Brunch (It was 3pm).  Everywhere we tried to go had closed at 2 or 2:30... but not Mickey's!  We arrived at 3 pm, had some amazing Bloody Mary's, Salty Dog's, and a few more Easter cocktails to top it off.  Had amazing food (Mickey's burger for $8.95 is a STEAL of a deal!  So GOOD!!) but the best part of the afternoon was our WONDERFUL waiter Kevin!  Who was so sweet, and attentive... AND... he looks like Jesus Christ!  On Easter of all days!!   It was like the second coming!!   Only great things to say about Mickey's!  Highly recommended!  Thanks Mickey's, and thanks KEVIN (Jesus) for a wonderful Easter afternoon!"}
{"text":"Mickey's Tavern has the best burgers in town. Always perfectly cooked and delicious.   The chicken tacos are also amazing. I've had them several times and they have always been so very amazingly scrumptious. The tacos come with a spicy salad that is also very good.  Things that I've ordered several times that I would recommend:  Biscuits & Gravy, Coconut Squash Soup and the Eggplant Panino. But really, anything you order will probably be worth it.  The space is very casual and fun. The patio is nice when it's warmer, although you'll have to deal with smokers.   They have a good selection of beer and make a good mixed drink. They make a good Bloody Mary, too.  If you haven't been there, just go and check it out. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Dark bar with TCM playing, umm hell yes!!   Food is fabulous, drinks are cheap and decor is cool.  I wish I could remember our bartenders name because she was amazing however the alcohol has erased that memory from my brain!"}
{"text":"Everything a person could want in a brunch...from the joy of discovering surprisingly upscale flavors inside what appears to be a hole-in-the wall, to a properly spicy Bloody Mary, to a breakfast burrito where they'll happily sub veggie sausage. Even loved the ska/salsa/lounge mix playing in the former living room where we ate. On weekends, check out the cute (not smelly) antiques shop upstairs. Absolutely fantastic spot!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've eaten in years. I honestly don't need to say much more than that, other than to suggest upgrading to the \"sexy fries\". They're worth it!"}
{"text":"A quaint dive bar in one of the best neighborhoods in Madison.  Very eclectic feel with various vintage and thrifted items through out.  Features live music frequently, a game room with pool table, lovely outdoor patio, great bar food, and lots of character."}
{"text":"We started of our Sunday Funday with brunch at Mickey's Tavern on Willy Street. It was the first real warm and sunny weekend of spring so their outdoor patio (smoking allowed) was quite crowded. But we managed to get seating for our group of 7 without too long of a wait.   We started with drinks- mimosas and their famous bloody mary. I liked my bloody mary (you can order it with or without a beer back, and in a smaller size about the size of an old fashioned glass). It was on the spicy side, heavy on the horseradish but very generous with the pickled garnishes (my fav part!).   As for food, don't expect fancy schmancy gourmet dishes. Instead, look forward to enjoying solid, classic brunch dishes. It took some time for our food arrive but we were happy hanging out savoring the sunny day. I had an over easy egg with bacon and potatoes. The egg was cooked just right, bacon was on the crispy side, potatoes were crunchy on the outside, fluffy inside.. yums! You can also substitute the potatoes with greens. My friend had the waffles with fruit and it looked great- with a generous serving of whipped cream.   I've also had drinks inside indoors and love the deco. Eclectic vintage mirrors, couches, lamps and art- a cool place to chill with friends. Mickey's is cash only, but they have an ATM in the front."}
{"text":"Delicious food (love their super sexy fries and green chile pork), friendly bartenders. Nice patio on the backside and the inside is cozy (and dark). Overall, a great place to go grab food and/or a drink.  Cash only. Come prepared! (Or use the ATM inside.)"}
{"text":"green pork chili, bloody mary,.....both great choices! however, as others said, i also had a 45/50 minute wait, and was \"due to one chef\" being there during their major rush time.  I know they mean well, but still was a frustrating experience compared to my first great one!!!"}
{"text":"I Love the decor and the original charm kept when converting the house into a bar. The little rooms in the back with the old couches and furniture are great for hanging out with a small group of people.  The food is fun, with a name like \"sexy fries\", who wouldn't be tempted? It isn't gourmet by any means, but for casual hippie/hipster-area bar its perfect.   Willy Street is of course, a great location, with lots of other bars and restaurants a hop, skip, and a jump away; and the people who hang out or live around the area are great.  If I lived a little closer, Mickey's would be a main hangout."}
{"text":"If pressed, I'd have to say that Mickey's is my favorite bar in Madison, which, as you know, is a town full of great bars.  I come to Mickey's for three reasons, in ascending order of awesomeness-of-experience: typical bar-going; my Wednesday knitting group; and their weekend brunch.  Mickey's as a bar is fun and homey.  It's a collection of different rooms, plus an outdoor patio, which on summer evenings is a divine place to have a beer with friends.  The beer selection itself isn't huge, but it's definitely more than adequate.  The bartenders are friendly and don't play favorites.  There's lots of seating and standing room.  The crowd is local, pleasant, and hip, but not too hip -- the \"swivel factor\" is pretty low here.  And they host cool stuff like April '10's Karaoke Underground, which was one of the funnest nights of my life!  Mickey's has been incredibly accommodating to our fairly rowdy, 10- to 20-person knitting group as well; while they couldn't reserve a space for us for our Wednesday evening meetings (we generally gather from 5-ish to 9-ish), the back room is usually available, and the wait staff is always gracious as we clamor for booze, soda and food.  They're responsive to our requests and frequently check on us.  Jane herself even dropped by once to welcome us!  But my favorite reason to come to Mickey's is their weekend brunch, which I adore so much that my boyf and I have made it a Saturday-morning ritual.  The World's Greatest Sandwich (a BLT with a fried egg and Swiss cheese) is, indeed, the world's greatest sandwich, and their bloodies are always topped with a delicious assortment of pickled vegetables (my favorite is the Brussels sprout).  The coffee is serve-yourself (yes!!) and FREE (YES!!!!).  The waiters and bartenders are very sweet and always smile politely when I give them my Sally Albright-style sandwich specifications.  The food in general is actually really good -- everything I've tried has been tasty -- although, as a creature of habit, I do tend to stick to the WSG.  So, Mickey's is really more than just a bar -- it's a restaurant, a meeting place, and the kind of cozy, quirky establishment that makes me thank my lucky stars I live in the Wil-Mar neighborhood."}
{"text":"There's a lot to like about Mickey's.  There's a cozy, fun atmoshphere, a great patio, generally tasty food, and interesting live music offerings throughout the week.  All of this is trumped by a few snooty, hipster bartenders.  For every friendly, helpful staff member there is a rude bartender just waiting to ignore you.  When s/he finally sidles over to you, don't expect eye contact.  More than likely your drink order will be met with an eye roll and a heavy sigh.    True story: A friend and I walk into Mickey's.  The last game of the NBA finals is on the TV with 8 minutes left.  We sit down, and wait for the bartender to stop her conversation long enough to help us... all the while, we are watching the game.  We finally order our drinks, get them, and continue to watch the remaining two minutes of an intense game.  Immediately after closing the cash register the bartender grabs the tv remote, and changes the channel to some black and white movie that's halfway over.  Now if that's not a big \"Fuck You\", I don't know what is.  Long Review Short: Be prepared for the bartenders to be dicks to you.  Not all of them!  Just most of them."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hang outs in Madison. Low key, with great staff."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is literally a house half-converted to a bar. Pretty low key place to stop. I am going to make a regular visit when I am in the Willy St area.  Also has a nice outdoor patio... so get there while the weather is still tolerable."}
{"text":"I've never felt so at home without being at home. Go past the bar into the seating table area and you'll find yourself thinking you're not at a restaurant. Sofas, side tables, dinner tables, everything is fair game.   The food was decent.   The eggs Benedict was good but nothing that I can say sets it apart as being a signature dish.   The biscuits and gravy were okay despite the huge portion of gravy (which I'm always okay with).   It's a good place, but at the moment it's not one that I'd be dying to go back to."}
{"text":"Great old neighborhood bar with good food, and service. This place has an interesting menu with lots of choices. The bike trail is right behind the place if you want to fortify yourself with a Martini halfway through your ride. I grew up a block from here on East Wilson so remember the place from fifty years ago. I know that Mickey was a black lab and thats where the name came from. Look over the bar and there are some rememders of him that you will not notice if I didn't mention it. So I did. You're welcome.  In those days they had a pier on the Yahara river which is just across the street, where boaters would tie up and go have a drink and get a six pack to go. The good old days. They have a back room that you might miss unless to go to the toilet and they have small bands here as well. Forget the brunch. Its too popular now and the wait can be long. It is good I just don't like waiting. My wife says Im a grouch, I say I'm just too busy to wait for breakfast. I have spoken."}
{"text":"Awesome Bloody Mary's, delicious scramble, great tap beer selection, conversational bar tenders as busy as they were. So glad the previous reviews were true!!! Was totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, amazing patio, and the super sexy fries are addicting. What more could you want in a bar?"}
{"text":"Visiting my daughter in Madison we came here for after dinner drinks. Staff is great- place is fun! Worst vodka Collins ever and so-so vodka cranberry but thankfully great local brews.  Smoky as hell on  the patio so it is inside for us. Will look forward to trying their food which my daughter says is good.  All in all a good hanging out spot."}
{"text":"This was the breakfast I wanted at Plaka Taverna.  Mickey's is a small, divey bar that always seems like it's filled with hipsters. My family was up this weekend for graduation, and I took them there for breakfast--a first for me.  Yes, a bar for breakfast. They apparently have awesome Bloody(s), but due to my hangover from post-grad celebrating, I passed.  I had the eggs over easy, with toast and potatoes, and a side of bacon. Without the bacon? $4.50. Bargain.  Eggs were cooked flawlessly, toast was wonderful (good bread, too!), and the home fries were outstanding--no hash/sliced ones like Plaka Taverna. Coffee was surprisingly good, too.  We all got a form of eggs, except for my brother, who got the breakfast burrito--it came with kickass salsa and the flavor combo in it (chorizo, eggs, cheese) was great.  I'll definitely be back. Pics of the breakfast/brunch menu are posted. Delicious."}
{"text":"A great bar that manages to cater to multiple kinds of patrons----from college students to family diners to the local drunks. Good beer garden in the summer, nice dive-y front area for people watching, great surprisingly quiet  'pool room' that feels more like a 1960s den.   The pizza is great, very thin and I'm surprised to say that it's probably one of the five best pizzas in Madison. Their mac and cheese is enormous, rich, greasy, and decadent. It's good, but could probably use an acid to cut the grease, and something like bacon to add texture and smoke to the cheese. 'Sexy fries' were about as sordid as Estelle Getty, but did the job of tasting like fresh-made potato chips and were good for sharing."}
{"text":"Great bar, feels like being in your friends living room. I love the sexy fries! Good variety of beers and spirits, very reasonable prices, awesome live music. Feels super divey some times. Can't beat chilling on the patio for brunch with their awesome Bloody Mary! The kitchen is not open late, so get their early if you want food.  Great bike parking, love the bike service station in the back."}
{"text":"Just stopped here yesterday morning for brunch and it was amazing. Cool space, nice staff, and great food! A must stop for locals and out of town guests as well."}
{"text":"I met with some co-workers at Mickey's for dinner and happy hour on a weekday evening after work. We sat on the patio and hung out for a few hours. I ordered the Caesar salad and it was the best salad I have eaten in a long time. They added fresh anchovies, homemade croutons, fresh Parmesan and house made Caesar dressing. Sooooo so good, and so fresh.  The anchovy was so fresh and briny, a perfect complement.   My co-workers ordered craft cocktails that looked wonderful and refreshing. I loved how they were served in Mason jars.    The layout of the place is almost like walking through the rooms in a house. When you walk in there is the bar, you have to walk through a small hallway and past the kitchen to the patio, or through another room where there are tables, couches, and a pool table.  I really like this place. Excellent, sophisticated food preparation, a laid back, hippy/hipsterish vibe, a local neighborhood feel, and a great location if you want to walk around after eating.   4+ stars. I'm eager to check out the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Mickey's isn't for everyone, but it's definitely for me. All the ambiance of a classic dive with the best burger in town, decent cocktails, and a good crowd. The juke box puts many others to shame but you won't often hear it because there's usually some sort of live music. (That said, one night recently someone played Michelle Branch \"Thousand Miles\" on repeat for half an hour. Nice work.) It's got a great front bar, that odd, living room-esq back room, and a spacious patio. I've ended up talking to more strangers here than anywhere else in Madison. And sharing conspiracy theories with the bar tenders? Madison needs more bars like this."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mickey's consistently for the past three years and I will say this, cocktails are made proper, food is delicious (don't ignore the specials board!) and they have a great outdoor patio that is dog friendly, but my only problem is the female bartenders are very unpleasant, lighten up!That will not stop me from going, however."}
{"text":"Hipster bar where the food is decent but the terrible wait staff and bar tenders aren't worth the trouble.  They're rude.  I've heard people say \"It's just they're thing.\"  As far as I'm concerned it's not permissible."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight. Told myself that I would only go in if I found a parking spot in their tiny lot. SO SO glad there was.   Time Lapse of Night:  8:00 - walk in & had a seat at bar. 8:01 - Ordered Sexy Fries (sm) & Bloody Mary. 8:10 - Bloody arrives 8:15 - Sexy fries arrives 8:15-8:45 - Txted,eat, chatted with bartenders 8:45-? - Someone finally sat next to me. Thus chatted and meant more people.   Sexy Fries your so fine.The small size could feed at least 2 people. Thinly cut. Great balance of some slices extra crispy, some soft. Drizzled with just the right amount of  truffle oil and topped with a snow shower of parmesan.  The Bloody Mary is so far the best on my quest to try as many at any establishment that carries them. Just look at my picture you can see the shredded horseradish and ground pepper. Almost creamy, super rich and kickin.  The bartenders were on top of asking if needed anything and friendly. An atmosphere of it's own that worth checkin out. Great diverse crowd.  Glad to say that my first time in bar by myself was memorable and not scary.   You did good Mickey's"}
{"text":"If you want to compare it to a fancy pants restaurant, you should go there instead.  For bar food, they excel.  I almost want to rate it one star so it doesn't get overcrowded.  One of the best places in town.  Great service, nice owners, strong menu, beautiful beer list."}
{"text":"I've come here twice while traveling.  It really does feel like I'm sitting in a parlor or a living room, chatting over bloody mary's and having a delicious meal.  Great service.  Loved the house burger, frites, bloody mary's.  Had breakfast once (eggs) and it was also great."}
{"text":"I have not eaten the food. Just a forewarning.  I love their patio and their drink offerings. The boozy coffee is amazing!  I have not had anything like it, or that delicious for that matter. It had a whip cream vodka, a caramel vodka and coffee for just $7. Wow?  Yes.  The beer selection is great too! You see so much Potosi around Wisconsin and yet I had never seen the Steamboat Shandy. I think...why not?  Delicious! Doesn't even taste like beer, which is a little dangerous.  But, hey, it was pretty tasty.    My only complaint about the patio. Some people were smoking. Just because it is outside, doesn't mean people want to snuggle up next to that."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!! Fantastic drinks! Sexy Fries! The worlds greatest hamburger! I don't know what else to say. Our service was wonderful. The food took a little while but I was with great company so I thought the pace of the meal was leisurely; I didn't feel rushed to be in and out in an hour.   My hamburger was sensational! They seasoned the meat perfectly, added that chipotle aioli and some perfectly peppery fried onions on a ciabatta bun! Delicious!! And Sexy fries... the name says it all. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I really love their outdoor patio.  It is a great place to chill and have a beer in the summertime--and Mickey's really does have oh-so-many tasty microbrews on tap!    I love the concept of the indoor bar, as well.  It's a converted house with each room painted a different color.  My favorite is the reddish-room just off of the main bar area.  I just tried the food last night.  I had a \"Mickey's Burger,\" which was good, but I've had better.  I was super excited to try the \"Sexy Fries,\" which are thin slices of potatoes with truffle oil and parmesan.  Really, they weren't that great.  They might have been if the potatoes had been evenly layered with the oil and parmesan, but only a few slices on the whole stack seemed to have any flavor.  I dunno about you, but I don't really like eating plain potatoes.  The cheese curds weren't all cooked completely, which was extremely sad because I could see their potential for being phenomenal if they had been.  They had a good coating and tasty cheese, but it just wasn't melted thoroughly.  I'd eat here again, anyway."}
{"text":"It's hard not to love Mickey's, if only for their awesome patio in the Madison summers. If I lived closer to Mickey's, this would be my weekly haunt.   Mickey's has a sign right when you walk in the door that explains exactly the type of service you should expect, i.e. European style, slow paced, sit back and enjoy the company you're with. In other words, this is not a rush you in, rush you out kind of establishment. This is a place that lets you savor those long conversations with your friends, slowly sip that beer, and nibble on those sexy fries.   The sexy fries are a hit or miss for me. Sometimes beautifully perfectly fried, but sometimes a bit overfried and not as enjoyable. But then I discovered their super sexy fries which is regular fries with the same truffle oil, parmesan, and red pepper topping, and this is always perfect for me. I'm also a fan of their salads topped with steak and the lime dressing.   I've also been to Mickey's for brunch. Their brunch dishes are just okay for me, but their bloody marys are the star. They're perfectly mixed - not too garlicky or heavy on the tomato taste, enough alcohol for that nice early afternoon buzz. The bloody mary toppings aren't excessive (I don't need a fried chicken with my bloody mary), but not sparse either."}
{"text":"During the few wintry months I lived in Madison - after moving from LA and before moving to Milwaukee - this was my sole, dependable drinking spot.  Good jukebox, good pool table, lots of rooms to explore, and reasonably-priced drinks.  Mickey's was a godsend after being subjected to LA's uniformly horrible bars."}
{"text":"This place offers brunch on Sunday, BUT DON'T GO!!!  WAY TOO CROWDED.  No reservations, no plastic, no dice.  If you like inconvenience, go.  Like four tables and then some clientele linger, which is rude in such a place.  Pro:  cheap, good Bloodies.  Especially not good for groups.  The random one or two, maybe, but be prepared to sit at the bar, if you can.  Not good for groups.  Did I mention NOT good for groups?"}
{"text":"My kind of place.  *casual vibe; laid-back clientele *great selection of beers, (not surprisingly, very Wisconsin-centric) *jukebox, with a wide variety of tunes *nice crowd (but not too crowded) *delicious looking food (we just had dinner so we didn't eat, but others seemed to be enjoying it) *friendly bartenders *comfortable bar stools (a much-appreciated detail; I have a bony ass)  Mickey's is just the kind of place where you could spend an evening and not feel the need to go anywhere else. We did just that."}
{"text":"Initially I only knew this place as the \"sexy fry\" place. In fact, I thought this place was called \"sexy fries\" because that was what my friends called it.  So I had a goose island ginger beer, my friend enjoyed a nice Crispin and her husband had an almond drink. We all ordered some burgers, which was clearly the way to go, and all subbed sexy fries. It was also pretty entertaining to see my friend's one year old chow down on Sexy Fries too - he was clearly a big fan of the truffle oil. We sat in the back room, where there were board games and a pool table (3 quarters for a game), and it was a great hipster Mother's Day dinner.   Also, across the street is a \"Brew and Grow\" place, which I also found entertaining. I'm officially a fan of the \"sexy fries\" place, whatever name you choose to call it by."}
{"text":"The sexy fries were tasty and unique. The beer selection was pretty good and the atmosphere was great. We went at a really dead time, but I think it would be a fun bar to hang out in for the night."}
{"text":"We started a Willy Street bar crawl here and it was a solid choice. Truly delicious bloody mary and the first that I've had which came with a garnish of brussel sprout. The omelette wasn't memorable but it was tasty."}
{"text":"Great dive bar with really good food.  Burger and fries are outstanding (some of the best in Madison).  Beer selection is good.    Vibe is hipster/hippie.   The back patio in the summer is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Joined a few friends here for Sunday brunch, but none of us realized that they don't open until 10(a bit late, in my opinion) though...so we were stuck loitering for a half hour outside..  Thankfully, it was nice out, so when we were let in, we decided to go right back outside--onto the back patio. There are quite a few tables outside, several large enough for 6-8 people.  Two of us decided that bloody mary's were a must, and I was pleased. They came topped with an array of veggies, but the drink  itself was a bit mild for my taste. I meant to ask for extra spice...but forgot.   I tried the World's Greatest Sandwich, which was basically a BLT with an egg. Good, but not great. Certainly not the World's Greatest. The slaw that came on the side was a nice touch, though. It was tangy and not mayo-laden. The scrambles looked yummy, too.   Our server was friendly and competent, which is always a plus. So, all in all, Mickey's is a good Sunday brunch for late risers who enjoy outdoor dining!"}
{"text":"Really solid brunch place. The menu is simple but they do it right! I ordered the daily scramble which was amazing and had some friends got bloodies which they also said were on point. I've eaten out on the patio in the back which is really nice if the weather is right.   Haven't been there for dinner yet, but definitely want to check out some time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite watering holes in Madison.  Has got to have one of the most eclectic set of patrons I have seen.  Hipsters, homeless, emos, conservatives (me), and queer, it is a great mix.  Drinks are hella strong and have some great nightly specials.  I also think their food is great for a bar.  It doesn't try to be anything it is not...It doesn't have to as it is that cool."}
{"text":"I recently went to Mickey's Tavern for brunch after Mickey's Dairy Bar was closed. What a great place! When I walked in I thought it was really small, but then my friend led our group to the back rooms. The atmosphere and layout were so cool. It felt like I was in someone's living room just hanging out and eating breakfast.   The food was great, too. The bloody mary had the perfect amount of spice and a great variety of vegetables to top it off. The waitress was even kind enough to bring me more olives. My boyfriend, friend and I all ordered the eggs any style with toast and breakfast potatoes with a side of bacon. Everything was great. My other friend ordered the vegetarian scrambler which looked pretty tasty.   Very satisfied with my experience and would love to go back."}
{"text":"Mickey's tavern had a friendly environment, but everything was too tight. As a party of five, we were seated so closely the two other tables that my friend kept accidentally knocking into the other table, even knocking over the other's coffee. Constantly having to get up to get coffee in this tight space did not make a pleasant experience.  I love eggs benedict, and I always get it at every brunch place I go, but I don't think I'll repeat that here. I always ask for my eggs to be made without butter, and most other restaurants make an amazing benedict without the use of processed dairy. However, Mickey's has not perfected a dairy free eggs benedict. The eggs tasted like a metal pan with a very chalky consistency. My friend who had a normal eggs benedict said his tasted amazing, so I'm sure because some substitutions were made that mine was an exception. But for you lactose intolerant people out there going to Mickey's, don't get the eggs benedict.  Other than that, good server and friendly environment. Willing to go again and try something else. Maybe with less people though because the space is too tight for a large number of people sitting indoors."}
{"text":"Lamburger was delish. Good underground Bands play here but it's not really a club setting. Nice vibe, neighborhood dive where u can rub elbows with local musicians, artists & Eastside sleaze.."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary in town!  I've had their sexy fries, green chile pork, pulled pork sandwich, and quesadilla.  All great, but would skip the pulled pork.  Great outdoor seating and unique indoor seating.  Friendly staff.  I personally would skip this place for breakfast since I haven't had anything I've liked for breakfast food."}
{"text":"The decor is cool, the food and drinks, OK, the patio lovely. Just don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great pub grub. Good sandwiches for everyone including vegans (i.e. me) - the Lonestar - without the coleslaw."}
{"text":"Everything I want in a local bar: stumbling distance, pool tables, (clean) couches and a large private patio. The bartenders are friendly and the musical selection on the jukebox is unmatched. My favorite part: the layout! It's a house AND a bar! Very neat-o. Go for the drink deals and great service, stay for the diverse crowd and friendly conversation. Can taste a little like Amateur Night on weekends, so if you're averse to the thong-and-makeup crowd or fighty lightweights, go during the week. VERY service-industry crowd friendly!"}
{"text":"I love Mickey's. I love that it's a converted old house, with the back rooms still looking as such with bright paint and comfy couches. There's a pool table in back, and the bar area also serves as concert space. In the warmer months their huge patio is perfect for a nice night chatting with friends.   The drinks run strong (last night we couldn't taste the difference between the whiskey ginger and whiskey Sprites we ordered) and the beer is cold. Sometimes the bartenders can be a little gruff (though never rude or mean), but that's half the fun.   Bonus points for supposedly being haunted by a guy who got knifed. No old building is complete without a good ghost story."}
{"text":"So I've tried to love Micky's - I just can't get into it. The service is so so. Micky's tries very hard to appease the hipster crowd. I'm just not into any casual trend in which somebody has to try to be casual.   First off parking is always a hassle. As I mentioned the service is so so. You have to sort of be your own advocate to get service at all.   I had the sexy fires and a stewed pork appetizer. The sexy fries are a home made pile of house cut potato chips with truffle oil and parmesan. They were greasy and cold - but had decent flavor.   The pork was heavy on spice and salt - not so much on flavor. The spice and salt more or less bowled over the pork flavor.   My review rating of 2-Stars is based on 3-4 or for experiences where the food and service has been so so. Maybe it's a place that caters to the regulars - I'm just not a regular and not impressed. I'm not a hipster and not really interested in the hipster scene."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Madison, so far. Scramble du jour is fantastic along with a Bloody Mary and beer back. Can't be best. Bartender Kevin is a good dude and the coffee seals the deal. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"i really, really, really like this place.   today was my first time here, after living in the area for a year and driving past about a bazillion times. so finally we decided to hit it for brunch.   the service was a little slow, and the bloody mary was just ok (but it came with a massive amount of salad, which is always a plus in my book)... however, the food was fan-tas-tic. i had a wisconsin peasant sandwich, which had scrambled eggs, feta, spinach, tomatoes and pesto on grilled bread. YUM. my bf had the mickey burger and loved the fact that someone had the idea to put giardiniera on a burger.   i like the fact that the coffee and water is just sitting out on a counter, so if you're thirsty, you can get your ass up and get it yourself. also, the decor is really cool, colorful vintage stuff, which certainly doesn't hurt. there's pool in the back and a few different seating areas.  we'll definitely be frequenting mickey's again soon."}
{"text":"I can finally give this bar five stars now that it is smoke-free.  Don't get me wrong, I like a cigarette now and again (and again) but the airflow in this place was not conducive to anything but black lung.  I love the different rooms in this bar which used to be a house.  It is kind of like being at a high school house party, but with the kitchen replaced by a nice bar area.  Neat-o!  I came here one night and there was a group of about ten people playing  violins, accordions, even a harp!  Totally legit Irish music, what a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for drinks after work, but this weekend I tried out their weekend brunch. Really good food (they don't have a huge menu - which I appreciate!) I had one of their specials, an egg scramble with shredded pork, and it was delicious. Their Bloody Mary's are fantastic (they are on the spicy side).  Mickey's has a great space, and an outdoor patio too. The service was great (for Sunday brunch) and it's a very reasonably priced menu. Cash only, but they do have an ATM. One downside is parking (it's on Willy St); they have a tiny parking lot. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: -Fantastic atmosphere and nice energy. I always have a good time here. -Generally solid food. They are a half notch above most bars when it comes to their food offerings, but I wouldn't go there just for a meal. When I have, I've been mildly disappointed.   Cons: -Service sometimes borders on the apathetic. It can take a while just to get someone's attention.   -Cash only is annoying.   -Sexy fries are not sexy. They taste like soggy chips. I've seen this style of \"fry\" popping up more and more often, and I'm adamantly opposed. Make fries or chips. You can't have it both ways."}
{"text":"Rockin' tofu scrambler, solid egg-sausage-potatoes-sourdough-toast for the four dudes I went with (originality all around). Fun, relaxed atmosphere, service friendly but more or less what you'd expect at a tavern on a sluggish Saturday morning. I'll be back for cocktails and pool!"}
{"text":"Well, its a house converted into a tavern. So the seating arrangements can sometimes be tricky; BUT if you can get a group of people together and grab one of the rooms with couches I guarantee you'll have a terrific evening!  The prices are reasonable and the drink specials are ok, they sometimes have live music which makes for a good time!!"}
{"text":"During a weekend visit to Madison, my husband and I went to Mickey's because I'd heard they have great Bloody Mary's- yes, they absolutely do! They come with all sorts of yummy things, but most importantly, a beer back. The bar itself is retro and what a bar should be- comfortable and doesn't take itself too seriously. My husband and I agreed that if we lived in Madison, we'd definitely frequent Mickey's."}
{"text":"This is a nice little townie-type bar.  Decent beer lineup, friendly staff and good food.  I liked the mac and cheese and my wife loved the World's Greatest Sandwich.  You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I used to pass this place every day when I headed to school.  I started going there right after college around 2000.  It was still a little rough around the edges as in it catered to both hipsters and the local scumbags.  Now it is full on yupster / stroller contingent.  Now there's always a marginal band that's always too loud.  Still like it though as it will always be home."}
{"text":"Last night I had gone out to dinner with a friend in Madison and after the dinner we found ourselves with nothing better to do at 7 pm on a Sunday night. I know Madison is a substantial town, but 7 pm on a Sunday night does not leave a whole lot of options.   But then I remembered I had Mickey's in my back pocket. I would give Mickeys 5 stars on two conditions. The first is if both beers I wanted were actually on tap (the tap ran out and no one switched out the kegs), and the second is if the bartenders just spend a little less time flirting and goofing around with each other. Having said that, I get that being a bartender at an establishment like this is not really about being too serious so I get it. Another thing to take into consideration is the parking. As it is on Willy Street, the parking can be a headache but this wasn't the case on a Sunday night.   I've eaten their brunch on other occasions. Solid brunch. In the past I have had the breakfast burrito and it was one of the better breakfast burritos I have had. I also think Mickey's happens to have the best bloody mary in Madison. When someone finds a better one, please send me a message to let me know.   The friend I took was just as enamored with the place as I was upon my first visit there. Everytime I go to Mickeys it is just a hodge-podge of people. There really is no set \"group\" of people that go into this bar. I made my friend take a walk through tour of this bar with me; what can you expect, this bar is in an old house. The different themed rooms complete with chalkboards in the bathroom just make this a place to experience.  If you love to sit, drink a beer and people watch get to Mickeys. Now. You won't be sorry.  P.s. Cash Only"}
{"text":"Great, laid back atmosphere with a unique layout.  Attentive bartenders - make great sangria!  Ordered lunch - the coconut squash soup is to die for!!!!  The bloody's are some of the best we've had.  We've returned several times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"I was told that this was the classic midwestern bar brunch and it didn't disappoint. My bloody mary was solid and came with (as is apparently common practice around these parts) a small cup of PBR as well. I don't know why I'd need a beer chaser but getting both for $6.50 is a steal.  I am no fan of brunch generally. It's usually an expensive pain in the ass that I can't be bothered to go out for. But not at Mickey's. The prices and value are good, and it's lack of presumption means you can just enjoy your weekend morning booze and eggs in peace."}
{"text":"Great little bar. Been here a few times for evening festivities, and went today for the first time for lunch with my husband. He got the Mac & Cheese, which he said was just a little bit too cheesy, but still VERY good, just can't eat a lot of it at once. I got the reuben with \"sexy\" fries. Not a huge fan of the fries, but I can see how someone might find them delicious. I just didn't care for the white truffle sauce they were tossed in. Tasted a bit too mushroomy to me. Still a 5 star review though, because the staff is always wonderful, the building is quaint and cozy, and my sandwich was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back, just probably won't order the \"sexy\" fries again... ;)"}
{"text":"Slightly hungover, we made our way over to Mickey's on Sunday morning after a night out in Madison.  Seriously, just get me some coffee and some water and I'm good to go - for a while.  The water and coffee are both self-serve; My efforts to rehydrate and caffeineate were slowed because it meant I had to actually stand up.  It's a smaller space with a back patio.  A little cramped.  I ordered the breakfast burrito without the tortilla.  It comes with delicious roasted potatoes.  My friend got the homemade granola and that looked amazing - I'll have to try next time.  Reasonably priced.  Decent service.  Great food."}
{"text":"Goddamn this place feels good. It's a house, it's a bar, the atmosphere is devoid of replicability. If I were a chain smoker, I'd never leave."}
{"text":"Ok, I get it.  You don't want to pay the merchant processing fees that come with accepting credit cards.  Fine.  But as a business owner, I think you should consider the fact that people tend to spend on average 30% more when they are paying with credit cards verses cash.    \"But we have an ATM\" - This helps, except when it's out of order because it malfunctioned while dispensing cash.  My cash in fact, that I never received.  As a result of your malfunctioning ATM my group moved to Gib's down the road because we literally could not give you any more of our business.  The inconvenience of an ATM and it's inevitable issues is not desirable.  I would love to see you accept credit cards even if it means bumping up your costs to cover the merchant fees."}
{"text":"Mickey's Tavern is a \"nice\" place. They have nice bartenders and really cozy atmosphere, so if you are in the casual mood, this is a good place to come with friends and talk. I'm not sure if this would be a party scene. Summer months seem to have more fun as the outside seating area open up.  *Updates* I had the chance to sit outside and enjoy a very fine evening with friends. We ordered \"Sexy fry\", which supposedly is a french fry with truffle oil. It was SO good especially on a empty stomach after a softball game. It was a perfect accompaniment to beer and good time."}
{"text":"Great quirky yet down to earth place on Willy street. When you first see the building you assume it will be a dive or biker bar but then you go inside and see how much personality Mickey's has with the vintage, funky, & colorful decor and walls. I also love that there are board games! Though it might help to restock them as many pieces were missing & some of the classic games would be fun to play as there were some very random and specialized options. Brunch was delicious but service was very slow that day. Took about 15 minutes for someone to greet us. I haven't tried the sexy fries but it is definitely on my to-do list!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 16 years. Love this bar. Problem is, every time I come here, I am reminded that I am not a regular. Tonight we came in to sit at the outside patio. Gonna get dinner. Seating for 52 outside, pretty busy, one visible server, so we go inside to order a drink. We were told to go outside to order our drinks. So we walked outside, saw our friend still sitting there without a wait staff waiting on him. We run into the server and try to order our drinks, she tells us to sit down and she will wait on us.... We refrained from saying it didn't work before...(sigh) Finally order our drinks, and she asks if we want a dinner menu. No thanks. Gonna go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Unique & clever mixed drinks. Elevated bar food.   Sexy Fries = sliced, stacked, fresh potato chips with truffle oil, parm and chili flakes. Devine and devoured before we knew it.  Chili Fries - Let's just say I will be here this fall when I want some chili. And I'm a picky chili eater.  Yup - it was a fry kinda day.  The patio out back is perfect for relaxing morning, noon or night. The menu isn't too large so you can be decisive. We'll be back for brunch sooner than later."}
{"text":"I want this to be a five star place, but I almost always leave brunch at Mickey's a little disappointed.  The bloody mary is a must. Although it's sometimes a little too spicy, the garnishes are spot on. I also love the rosemary toast that is an option with most brunch entrees. Plus, there is great outdoor seating (smoking is allowed outside), and dogs can dine on the patio. And inside is also pretty great - quirky and comfortable.  But, it's too inconsistent for me. On my most recent visit, they had no breakfast specials - which is kind of a big deal because the brunch menu is relatively small. I ended up with two eggs, toast, and bacon. More of a problem, though, the service on the last visit wasn't very attentive. The wait for everything was VERY long even though there were many open tables.  Also - cash only, ATM on site."}
{"text":"i suppose it's a testament to mickey's that we actually closed out this place on a sunday night despite:   - a buncha day-after-stpatricks weirdos including middle-aged ladies talking about santorum and 2 girls 1 cup - open mic night  crazy cheap drinks. friendly service. outdoor patio. a separate room for the quieter patrons and the pool hustlers. what else do you want?"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch, not hung over, delicious all the same. Food is so good! We had a variety of menu items among our group of 5, from the biscuits and gravy to the breakfast burrito to the specials du jour, scramble and lox Benedict. Top it off with a waffle with fruit and whipped cream and you'd be hard pressed to leave without a food coma.  I've never liked tomato juice and I could take or leave a bloody Mary. But wtf does Mickey add to their bloody Mary? Sooooo good! And a full veggie pickled salad on top really drives it home. Way to go, Mickey!  Self-serve coffee was just right. I like being able to warm up my mug at my leisure without having to wait for someone to come check on me.   Our server - I swear it's always the same guy - really does a great job of taking care of us. He knows his stuff. Thanks, man. Started our Sunday off right.  Remember: this is a cash-only establishment with ATM on site."}
{"text":"This place is very cool. Being from Chicago, the best comparison is \"Danny's\" The best part are all the little rooms coming off of the main bar room that are painted in all  kinds of funky colors with lots of interesting furnishings. My husband and I had fun taking portraits in each room. The outdoor beer garden is super pleasant and they make a good vodka gimlet. minus one star for the dumb ATM that ate my money...booo.. beware."}
{"text":"Really nice patio/outdoor seating and lunch. Food was delicious as was the Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"This just in... burgers ain't bad!  Aside from the 3 on the menu, you can build your own (for a price) with toppings that include fried onions, avocado, bacon, mushrooms and oodles more! Chips are standard, fried are a buck... if you want to go crazy get some sexy fries for a bit more! While I didn't care much for the bun, I think I may have found a burger that could go head to head with Alchemy."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Mickey's Tavern. I had the Eggplant Panino and the boyfriend had the Mickey burger. We upgraded to try the sexy fries and super sexy fries. We were both wildly impressed by everything. High quality meal for awesome prices and a fun chill vibe on a Monday evening. I guess some guys get together every Monday to jam- we left before they started but it was a very friendly environment."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mickey Burger and I believe Jules Winnfield would agree with me and say \"Mm-hmm! This is a tasty burger!\""}
{"text":"Ive had the worlds greatest sandwich** three times now and it really is the worlds greatest sandwich. I highly recommend this sandwich not only because I have had dreams about this sandwich but because your are doing yourself a favor by getting this sandwich. I do always get it with the famous cole slaw and the kettle chips which are great as well. I always want to order something else off the menu because it sounds amazing, but this sandwich is far to tempting not to order.     ** I order this sandwich with the egg cooked over hard."}
{"text":"Nice place and a good selection of beer. Female bartender was rude though. I know you guys can get busy but being nice about being in the way of your servers is a better approach than telling me \"you need to make room\" and huffing off after I apologize is not good service."}
{"text":"Mickey's comes in as my Top 3 bars in Madison.  The vibe here is always laid back and no one ever has an attitude despite the mix of grungers, artists, old timers and preps. Everyone just gets along and drinks together.  The vibe is dark, weathered and cozy. The music late night is loud and local. the deer selection is good but not surprising. The food is interesting aand well done. Breakfast here is easily one of my favorite things and their bloody s are the best in the city. Be warned though it ican be difficult to find a spot ehre in the morning before 1030 and everyone here drinks like its the end of the world, which I like :)  They have a patio which is quaint and if youre a guy the view from the mens urinal is refreshing and fun!"}
{"text":"We ate on the patio on a summer day and it was very pleasant. The \"seat yourself\" rule can cause problems, so be prepared for that. Also, you need to pour your own water and coffee, but that's just fine with me.   The bloody mary was very good and definitely not too weak. Also, I liked the variety of pickled vegetables they used for garnish.   The tofu scrambler was tasty -- the tofu is marinated in peanut butter which lends an unconventional but good flavor. Otherwise, it's a little light on the veggies. The sides: fried potatoes were a little too fried and were too crispy. The rye toast was just fine. I also had a waffle which was standard as well.   I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and pleasant patio. Our waiter was attentive and brought us what we needed. The food was nothing special, but I am looking forward to returning. No complaints."}
{"text":"one of the first bars in madison, it has also been smoking the longest.  this bar has had smoke in it before wisconsin was a state.  aside from its smoke, mickey's has hipsters that float in the air as well.  the interior design is cool and the music is fair.  cheap beer and mesh back hats are everywhere."}
{"text":"I like Mickey's, I really do, but the last time I went, the service was horrible. Previous visits included drinking only, and a sample of my friend's sexy fries! And I must say that the bloody mary's are awesome and include an amazing assortment of accoutrements...this is NOT your usually celery stick. You get a pickled mushroom, brussel sprout, olive, pickle, and who knows what else. Meal in a glass!   Onto the disappointment. I recently went for brunch and arrived just after my friends received their food. I ordered a drink and food, a friend ordered another drink, and another asked for a coffee. The waitress seemed super overwhelmed by our monstrous order. The waitress brought my bloody mary and forgot my friend's. My friend asked for the bloody mary again. The bloody came and after about 15 minutes, still no coffee. Coffee ordered again after the waitress returned to our table 20 minutes later. We see her take a shot at the bar in the distance.   Finally, drinks and coffee are on the table. It was an hour after I had ordered my food and still no food. I asked the waitress (after her 3rd shot at the bar) and she had forgotten to put in the food order. By that time, the bloody mary and nibbles of my friends' chips had been sufficient. I said nevermind to the food order (not knowing how long it would take to arrive!) and drank another bloody mary.   All in all, cool spot, crappy service (at least on that occassion)."}
{"text":"Good mac and cheese and great bloodies. BAD service (except Ben, he's a gem! And, perhaps Chris...). 3 of us were in there on a night that the kitchen was closed. We politely asked one of the bartenders if, since that was the case, if we could order some delivery (Oriental Wok, in case you're curious; they deliver 'till 2am!) Her response? \"I don't care.\" Really? So, if I wanted to get up on the bar, cop a squat, and take a nice big dump on the bar, you wouldn't care either? Oh, yeah, apathy is SO 'punk rawk'. Then, two of us asked for our Bloodies to be spicy. The response? 'We make a mix in the morning'. OK, so could you add some heat to ours? \"That doesn't MEAN anything.\" What the HELL?! She then proceeded to slam our Bloodies down and left a bottle of Tabasco on the bar. Well, fuck you too. We finished our food, drank our bloodies and left a buck. Just to be polite. Maybe some of those hipper-than-thou hacks could try following that example. If you don't want to deal with people not as tattooed, pierced, and snotty as you, DON'T WORK in the service industry. I live in the area so I'll be back for Bloodies, but my friend from Chicago was appalled by the way we were treated. He said he'd never go there again. Even if I was buying. Damn."}
{"text":"Brussel sprouts in your bloodies? Truffle oil on your fries? Kimchi for an appetizer?   YES PLZ!"}
{"text":"Love this place, and come here almost every week with my knitting group.  The mac 'n cheese is high quality stuff made with good cheese, so I recommend trying it even if you're not a fan of Kraft (I'm not!)."}
{"text":"Mickey's is great. They have everything you could want in a nice, laid back neighborhood bar. The interior is quirky and unique, off the main bar area through a small hallway is another seating area as well as a pool table. A few day's ago I made my first warm weather visit so I was finally able to enjoy the back patio. They have a nice selection of tap and bottle beers as well as a few cocktails. The food is great, nothing fancy, but always delicious. I tried their fish fry for the first time and highly recommend it, along with their sexy fries! The servers are always friendly too. It is definitely a place I'll be back to many times, whenever I need a solid, crowd pleasing option for a good drink or a casual meal."}
{"text":"I don't really hang out at bars a whole lot, but that being said; Mickey's is my favorite bar in Madison to hang out at. On nights that there isn't live music it is fairly low key and generally full of friendly (and attractive) people. The service is good, the food is really tasty (especially the coleslaw and sexy fries), the atmosphere is great, and they have just enough beers that it doesn't take me forever to decide what I want. The best part about the place really is the atmosphere though. The decor, the couches, the back patio, the lighting; it all just works."}
{"text":"Mickey's is chalked full of old-school vibe and hometown personality, without being excessively hippie or hipster.  Each room is different, one a living room with red walls and mirrors, another with pale green walls and old school photographs.   Tasty and cheap define the drinks, with 6 dollar pitchers of Newcastle-type ales or Old Style, depending on your tastes.   The crowd is neighborhoodish, folk-alt-country groups often play on the weekends, and don't forget about the small pool table and darts.  Mickey's is a must-experience for Madisonians and visitors who tire of the increasing blandness of the State Street scene."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place, from the cozy atmosphere that makes you feel like you're in someone's house to the cheap prices and delicious food. Best brunch spot in Madison. Their  biscuits and gravy are homemade and decadent. The bloody Mary's have a good balance of spices. No credit cards accepted but they have an ATM right by the front door."}
{"text":"The best place on the isthmus and for miles around for a bloody mary and a burger.  Sitting on the patio during the warm months on a Saturday or Sunday morning is ecstasy!!!  I love the bloody with the pbr chaser/beer back/schnit.  I also love the side of homemade coleslaw and chips that accompany my burger (I recommend dipping the chips in the slaw.)"}
{"text":"We stopped in on our way into Madison for a show. It was easy to find but they don't have much parking. We were just glad we didn't have to fight the crowds on State Street.  This is not a good place for large groups. There aren't many large tables, they won't split a check, and you have to pay in cash (however they do have an ATM). Also there's a small, but solid, menu so there may not be something for everyone.  That being said, the service was exceptional--even when we asked for substitutions or spilled the last bit of a drink--and the food was delicious. My burger was almost too juicy and the portions of all of our orders, even the salad, were pretty generous. And we needed it, because we also enjoyed their full list of cocktails made with a heavy pour. I would definitely recommend this tavern to a friend and I hope I'll be able to visit again."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the fact this is a neighborhood bar. The food there is better than many fancy restaurants in town and at a fraction of the price. Best kept secret on the East Side. The word is getting out because each time we go there it's more and more crowded."}
{"text":"Great bar. Reasonable price. Bad food. Adorable atmosphere. Lovely patio. Too loud.   Also, they only take cash, which is a pain."}
{"text":"I love going to brunch here! Best bloody Mary's! Food is great service is always friendly even when crazy busy! Love the outdoor patio! Always have such a great time."}
{"text":"A good bar on the east side with lots of character. Came for lunch and got the Mickey's burger. The patty was flavorful and well seasoned. I was excited about the giardiniera on the burger but could barely taste it. That was a little disappointing. The fries were cooked well and crispy. Overall, it was a solid lunch."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection, killer garlic fries/chips, super cool old building, and small.  If I lived in this neighborhood, Mickey's would be my go-to watering hole."}
{"text":"I've been to Mickey's for shows, both inside and out. Cool local dive in a hippie neighborhood. I was also able to go for brunch. I had the burger, a bloody and a can of beer. The bloody Mary left much to be desired, but the burger was delicious. Our server was attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"I've been converted. Mickey's is a GREAT place to hang out on the east side... probably the best place to just chill. Gentlemen, you're odds of picking up a gal are certainly better elsewhere, but that's not why you would  come here anyway. Right?  I'll admit, the musicians they book can be hit or miss, but all in all it's a great joint... even if the service is kinda slow.  I've upgraded Mickey's from 3 stars to 4. I just don't know what was wrong with me before."}
{"text":"It's a really groovy place inside, lots to look at, visually appealing.   The service, however, was pretty odd. My boyfriend and I once went in there and stood around the front door for a WHILE waiting to either choose our own spot or be seated? Weren't sure what to do. Only the folks who go there every day (and you could tell they did) knew what to do. I would like for Mickey's to be more new-comer friendly.   Also, I tried the Bloody Mary and it just tasted like someone poured a bunch of pickle juice in it. Perhaps that's something other costumers like, so I guess I can't bash it.   Please, Mickey's, have better service and we will love you!!!"}
{"text":"If all you want to read is this first sentence, then here's all you really need to know: try their weekend brunch and order the Tofu Scramble.   Tofu is one of those ingredients that half the world lives in fear of. Another small percentage of the population will brag about the tofu salad they had at lunch, though we all know they had to choke it down. There are then people who have experienced tofu done right and thus genuinely love the stuff. Trust that after trying the Tofu Scramble at Mickey's, you will fit into the latter group of the tofu world.   What makes this tofu so wonderful is that it's marinated in peanut butter. It's special. A common complaint with this often dismissed soy product is its tendency to taste bland if not prepared correctly. When it's cooked up at Mickey's with just the right amount of rich peanut butter, this worry is null and void. Add to this flavor packed mixture some sautéed spinach, sweet red pepper, and red onion and it's no wonder this dish is known for winning over anti-tofu folks. The fresh produce cuts the intensity of the peanut buttered tofu and offers great contrast in terms of color and texture as well.   Though it's only served Saturday and Sunday, the Tofu Scramble is so wonderful you'll be craving it all week long."}
{"text":"Nice little dive bar at the end of Willy St.  Cheap beer.  Pool table.  Jukebox.  What else do you need?  Can get smoky.  Maybe once this town goes smoke-free, I'll go there more.  If Mickey's doesn't collaspe.  I think the cigarette smoke there may be load-bearing."}
{"text":"Mickeys was the first place in town that I heard of when I first got here. I made it here after two months and I loved it! Yet another wonderful place to go when you're in Madison! Good beer I hear!!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of beers and a decent menu. We had the sexy fries and they were delicious.  Outdoor seating area is pet friendly, even providing a dog bowl for water."}
{"text":"Love: whiskey sours, drink prices, live music, ambiance, food - particularly, the coleslaw!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, and I'd probably give it a 5-star rating if it weren't for the hit/miss service and the occasional extremely long wait time both for a table and for the food.  The atmosphere is quirky, patrons reflect a \"keep Madison weird\" mentality often found on Willy St.; there are usually lots of tattoos and piercings.  The spaces are meandering with a barroom, an outdoor space, a billiards room, and a room with a love-seat.  The beer selection is pretty good and the food is always tasty!"}
{"text":"While back in Madison I had brunch at Mickey's  twice, and a pizza one night. Everything was really yummy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I really like Mickey's. It's a nice little spot that offers a creative (albeit limited) menu, drink specials, and a cool atmosphere. I've been in a handful of times now, and each time has been just fine.   Last summer, I was in and had lunch here on a Sunday afternoon. We opted for the outdoor seating and it was wonderful! It's like a little secret garden back there. So cute. It was fairly busy but service was still on point. The food was delish and the drinks were refreshing.   I was there again this past weekend for dinner. One bit of advice I would offer is, if you're coming in for dinner, sit in one of the back dining rooms. We took a table up front in the main bar area, and although the table itself was fine (a little chilly in front of a window) the dining room was super loud because of the bar. It was Sunday, after a Packer game, so I would imagine a lot of the patrons in there had been there a while, and they were loud, obnoxious even. It was our own fault for not choosing a spot outside of the bar area, but still annoying. Aside from that, service was good and the food was great!   The chili was fantastic! It had HUGE chunks of the most tender, delicious beef. And they didn't skimp! The BBQ pork was very good, and the Sexy Fries were awesome as well. Overall, everything we had was spot on.   The ambiance of the bar area is dark and divey, which is a stark difference from the other areas. They are clean and well lit, done in a sort of vintage-chic decor. There is a pool table in the back and lots of little seating through out the various rooms. Super cool place, all in all!"}
{"text":"I had never been to this place but was pleasantly surprised by how good their food was! I had the vegetarian quesadilla and that was scrumptious. It was not just overloaded with cheese like most. My husband got the lamb burger and he really liked it. They gladly subbed out the English muffin for a regular bun with no issues. The sexy fries were awesome and would recommend the small up charge to get them. They are a cross between French fries and potato chips with a hint of truffle oil Parmesan and a few other flavors.   One of the appetizers our friends got was a green chile with pork served with warm soft tortilla shells. We tried it and were blown away. Forgot what it was called on the menu but I don't think we will ever visit there again without ordering that.   Highly recommend grabbing a drink and some grub here!"}
{"text":"Good food reasonable prices staff is friendly but you are on your own for some things like seating and water. Bloody Marys are good and the food is plentiful."}
{"text":"Was in town for one night only, wanted to check out some local music.  Based on a review in the Onion, chose this place, very wisely.    Cool, divey neighborhood bar with a lively but relaxed crowd, attentive bartenders, and a good beer selection.  Didn't get to sample the food, but suspected that it was very good by the feel of the place and the specials on the chalkboard near the bar, and it looks like that's the case based on the reviews below.  The stage was near the front entrance, and there was surprisingly good sound and clear vocals given the set up.  It was busy but not so jammed that it was difficult to move around.    Good show, Mickey's."}
