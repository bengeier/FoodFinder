{"text":"bad food and worst service! The lady manager and waitress are horrible!  They don't smile or greeting their customers! They don't give us the regular menu just because we look like don't read English! Then they charge us 15% tip ahead because they said us \" the tourists\" don't know how to pay for the tip so they did it for us! I am from USA! I know how to give a tip! If u want a decent tip pls give ur customers a good service! If I can rate a \" zero\" star  I would do it! Don't come to this place! U will regret it!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but not excellent, but you definitely get more than what you pay for. The best part is that if you are a student you can get the lunch specials for dinner, meaning you can get a bunch of food for under $10 all day"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant apportez votre vin!
Le Général Tao et le Poulet à l'arachide avec épinards croustillants sont excellent. Service rapide et courtois (si vous êtes en heure de lunch, ne faite qu'aviser votre serveur, il n'y aura aucun problème!). 
La table d'hôte du midi comprend: Soupe, plat principal avec rouleau + thé au jasmin avec biscuit aux amandes (et biscuit chinois) pour 10,95$"}
{"text":"Belle découverte pour des mets asiatiques végétariens. Le service est rapide et courtois. Il y a 5 ou 6 choix végétariens/végétaliens épicés et réguliers. La fraîcheur des légumes, la cuisson à point et la saveur est au rendez-vous. J'ai beaucoup aimé les légumes sautés au cari et lait de coco. Puis quelques jours avant, j'avais aussi beaucoup aimé le tofu frit aux légumes  dans une sauce d'arachide. L'endroit assez grand est calme, propre et bien éclairé. Les prix sont très raisonnables et l'accueil et le service sont courtois."}
{"text":"A changé de nom maintenant Restaurant Délices-Nan. Les portions ont diminuées alors que les prix ont augmentés.
La qualité n'est pas au rendez-vous non plus ce qui explique pourquoi c'est maintenant vide comme endroit.
Je déconseille fortement le restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. I wished I had read the reviews before walking in here but we were desperate. They got our order wrong and the female manager charged us 15% tip on the bill. To charge us 15% on one order is unethical. Plus I saw a customer waiting to get seated for a long time and finally left when he received no service. I should've followed his lead."}
{"text":"Had to make a yelp account just to say how terrible this place is. Absolutely worst experience ever. Failed to read the reviews and stopped there late one evening . They brought us the wrong food, were rude when asked about it, included tip in bill and continued to be rude throughout the check out process. Montreal is a foodie town, pleas find another place !"}
{"text":"It's a Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese restaurant. I should have known better than to go to an unspecialized restaurant. The food is mediocre at best. I had Pho and they only had one option. I'm used to with having at least ten different options for Pho - with beef, tripe, etc. My fiancé had stir-fry beef that when served looked more like curry - again mediocre. Nothing amazing, but not terrible. You're probably safer ordering typical Chinese food that you would find off a Panda Express menu (orange chicken, general tso, etc)

Pros: clean restaurant"}
{"text":"EVIL management/staff and HORRIBLE food!
Do NOT come here. 
Don't do it!
You will regret it!
Pad Thai (usually a measure of overall quality) was bland and horrible, General Tao chicken was mushy and not chicken-like at all. 
Most of all, the management and staff are truly bad people who will be horrible rude, nasty, and mean to you.
There's a ton of other restaurants and thai places in the immediate vicinity. Go there instead! Run, don't walk, from this place."}
{"text":"Excellent repas.
Service sympathique et rapide. Nous avons adoré les dumplings à la Hunan, la sauce est simplement délicieuse.  Poulet général Tao croustillant et belle assiette avec les légumes!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Montreal for the first time and stayed right around the corner from this place. We got into town pretty late in the evening, and decided to stop in here for a quick dinner.

I had the Pad Thai with chicken. The portion was huge, especially considering the very reasonable price. The dish was decent--I've definitely had Pad Thai elsewhere that has been much more flavorful, but it wasn't bad.

Service was pretty quick, and you pay at the register once you are done so you can close out/pay at your own pace. Also, as an FYI, it's BYOB."}
