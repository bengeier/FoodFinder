{"text":"Nestled away in an industrial area, Tom's is my favourite place to do for breakfast in Newmarket. The prices are very reasonable and the food is always good.

 I usually get the Eggs Benedict, which has never disappointed me. The Hollandaise is much better than what passes in some breakfast spots in town. There's something about Newmarket and three eggs being the minimum at breakfast, but it holds true at Tom's as well.

I was hesitant to post a review because I can always find a seat here, but it was time to share this hidden spot with Yelp. Consequences be damned."}
{"text":"Breakfast is cheap for what u get!!   Also the burger is good.  If u wonder the double burger u will say omg!"}
{"text":"Great hearty breakfast. Got lost in Newmarket, saw this place and decided to stop by. Good friendly staff highly recommend."}
{"text":"I usually come here for breakfast if I can't cook in the morning for whatever reason. The price is cheap! The food is average, but for the price you can't complain! I've only had breakfast at this restaurant so I can comment on their other specialties ie Lunch specials. I recommend this joint if you are in the area and need a quick bite!

PS: Service is wonderful! Love the people working there."}
{"text":"Was a regular customer but when I questioned the owner about why I was being charged for a second cup of coffee all of a sudden he went ballistic and started to yell at us as we were at our table about how the price of coffee has gone up!  All I wanted to know was why we weren't told by the server that we would have to pay an extra $1.75 per cup after the first cup.  I felt that we should have been advised and then we would decide whether to have another cup of coffee instead of being charged once we finished our meal.  The owners response showed me he doesn't care about keeping his customers and he knows nothing about customer service!  My wife and I will never go back because of his response.  There are a lot of restaurants out there looking for customers and appreciate having regular customers and I guess Tom's is not one of those."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise, its tucked away on a random industrial street in Newmarket. Classic looking diner. Only open until 2PM (except 8PM on Fridays)

My wife ordered a BLT with fries ($7) and I ordered their big breakfast ($7), which comes with 3 eggs, homefries, toast, sausage, ham and bacon. Yeah crazy, no need to decide what meat you want.

Food - amazing value, cheap and good portions
Service - friendly wait staff, clean and pay at the door afterwards
Rating - 5 stars for being everything a good diner should be. No frills, simple and cheap food."}
{"text":"I'm not big on breakfast joints so take this for what its worth. They have a solid Western Sandwich that always hits the spot and it is almost always empty so no waiting but has a desolate feel if you are the only one there. Staff are quick and friendly. Good for filling up on the run."}
{"text":"Love Tom's. Tasty food, quick service, nice staff."}
{"text":"How awesome is it to find a fabulous diner in an industrial park open on a Sunday? Not only open, but doing a brisk business? Brilliant!

The menu is extensive, with all the usual suspects on it, plus some Greek favourites. We were there for a late breakfast and I had the breakfast quesadilla and R had the burger. Both provided more than enough food; we both left some behind. R's \"side\" Greek salad was a whole salad. Not the most exciting salad in the world, but great on the diner scale. The quesadilla was crispy on the outside, with lots of veg mixed with the egg. The burger was big and juicy (a multi-napkin meal). The coffee was pretty good too; again, great on the diner scale.

If we ever go back to Newmarket, I'll make a point of going back to Tom's."}
{"text":"Great breakfast at an exceptional price! Very friendly  staff. Don't have to worry about waiting to get a table even on the weekend.  Food is fresh and can't beat their special (3 eggs, home fries, toast, choice of meat). I always stop by if I'm in  the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is a spot that busts me right back to the 80s, when my dad would take us around to all these little diners and places around Ontario that he would discover on his work trips on the road. Ask him now and he could probably still tell you where to get a good, cheap meal in Thessalon. (only $12 for a steak THIS BIG!!) 

This spot has friendly staff, a menu board that hasn't changed in 30 years (except the prices, but not by much) and a big breakfast that you can pay for with change you found in your cup holder. I've come here a couple of times on the way to the office when I just needed some fried eggs, breakfast sausages and toast swimming in butter. The home fries are excellent as well. I'm sure their other menu options are great, but with a breakfast this good, served all day, why the hell would I get anything else?"}
{"text":"Hearty breakfast. Very delicious. Service was great. 
Very inexpensive. Really enjoyed it and will most definitely be going back for breakfast in the future :)"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but no hole in your wallet ;) 

Family-Ran VERY dated restaurant. Came here for breakfast and a bagel and they didn't disappoint! The value is totally there, I got a chocolate milk, bagel with cream cheese, and a breakfast special and only spent $10 and change. 

They use large eggs which is nice to see, the sausages had a nice little crunch to them and were quite tasty as well, home fries were a little soft for my liking. The bagel was toasted perfectly and had an adequate amount of cream cheese. No complaints whatsoever in the food department. 

Service is friendly as they always make sure you have everything needed. I noticed the staff would have coffee ready for regulars and know exactly how they want it. People come back here for a reason. 

The only thing is the restaurant is old and with CP24 playing in the background there's a old-er vibe to it going on. I mean if you're coming for the food than this shouldn't bother you as it didn't bother me l, just something I noticed."}
{"text":"This may be the first greasy spoon not owned by Greeks I have been to

This is a great breakfast spot but i had lunch here.

I had the daily special Western Sandwich with soup $7

Generous portion of scrambled eggs on brown and their zucchini soup.

Laurie, the awesome super busy server indicates that they make all their soup from scratch (Hence yesterdays Burger Soup special) so no harm there. In fact, all their food is made from scratch because that's just the way they like to do things.

Its a busy spot as it draws in the workers in this industrial area who prefer to eat honest food as opposed to spending the same amount for factory food from a national fast food chain.

Plus, you get a friendly server to chat with. and that deserves a tip!

Beats the drive-through and eating in your car with the windows down"}
{"text":"A standout breakfast!  Simple bacon & eggs with toast and fried potatoes gets kicked up a notch.  Sure, the eggs were properly done, and fresh.  The bacon was well crisped, the way I like it.  But the potatoes!

Unlike a lot of brekky joints, the potatoes are not deep fried chunks, or other lesser variations.  These were sliced potatoes, saut√©ed on the flattop with some of the sweetest onions I have ever tasted.  This is evidently a new twist for Tom's and a welcome one.

Tom's has a good variety of breakfast options, including several Benedicts.  I might have tried one, but I was told the Hollandaise is a Knorr preparation rather than fresh.  I'm a Benedict snob, so I don't know how long it will take before I deign to try the Eggs Benny, but at the rate I will be frequenting Tom's, it will likely happen."}
{"text":"It`s sad, because I get the sense that these folks really want to succeed, and because it`s clear from their diverse and widely variable lunch menu specials that they want to offer a lot.  But, in the end, um, meh.

Ok, fine, maybe one shouldn`t expect much from a $4 breakfast special.  It`s certainly cheap, but I did think that the ham I`d ordered with my over-medium eggs might be something other than a few warmed slices of ham coldcut meat.  Call me crazy.

On weekdays, Tom`s menu offers at least five different lunch specials per day, including tasty-sounding meals like variations on the meat-and-curry theme or something pan-Asian, pseudo-Jamaican, quasi-Greek, or semi-Italian.  On the paper, the variety looks good, but after my dirtcheep-but-blah breakfast, Tuesday`s pineapple chicken with shortgrain rice just added to the shoulder-shrugging whatevers.  Large chunks of sweet pepper, sure, but greasy and the chicken had enough textural semblance to liver that I actually wondered if it really was chicken at all.  Not a good thing.  

But it`s in the middle of just-north-of-Toronto-amid-industrial-plaza nowhere, so if you`re willing to not expect much, Tom`s can be ok.  You know:  edible.  The sort of place where you really want something fast while you stare at CP24 for the few moments you have there, and just before you do whatever the hell you`re in this area for in the first place. Beyond that, you may as well drive on."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck. This place is situated in a industrial neighborhood... the last place you would expect to find a restaurant. Although I must admit it looks like a retro no frills diner and I guess their location and timings are targeted towards factory workers. That might also explain why they have such decent brunch options for a very reasonable price.

I tried the eggs Benedict, one of my favourite brunch dishes. It was a generous portion with three poached eggs and loads of peameal bacon on top of an English muffin. The hollandaise was a bit runny for my taste. The poaching was also over done for one of my eggs. The star of the plate were the home fries. They were just perfectly seasoned and had the right crunch. I also liked the two fresh orange slices on the side. 
My companion had the big breakfast which hold true to it's name and includes three eggs (cooked to your liking), buttered toast, home fries, bacon, sausages and ham for just $7.45 plus tax. Apparently it used to be $6.45 before the bacon prices went up by a dollar. This alone is enough to satisfy all your brunch meat cravings. 

The quality and service were good for the price. I would avoid the eggs benny though and stick to more traditional options next time.

PS: $2.99+tax breakfast on weekdays (except Friday) includes three eggs, toast and home fries. They also have some lunch specials (sandwich+pop) for $5.99 + tax."}
{"text":"Amazing cheap breakfast. In my opinion the best diner in the area. For $4.49 you get three eggs, homefries/salad, and a meat (sausage/bacon). 

This isn't a gourmet restaurant so don't go in expecting some farm to table experience. It's your average, cheap breakfast and for $4.49, it can't be beat. 

I've been to Miliken restaurant which is a few blocks away and this place by far exceeds Miliken. 

Super super friendly and accommodating staff who are always helpful, polite and friendly. 

It's a great way to start the day. I should also add that I've only been here for breakfast but they serve a variety of lunch dishes as well."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, you get the 70s inspired look, even the music in the background :)
The staff is pleasant and the food is yummy. Veggie omlette, pancakes and breakfast quesadilla all hit the spot. And the price is decent too. Kids and wife loved it. We found our Sunday morning spot."}
{"text":"Toms has good breakfast for a cheap price!! Simple!!! The steak and eggs isn't bad for 10 bucks. The Shepherds Pie is good so is the lasagna. Burger is meh but still why would you get a burger when you have so many other options!! Toms is good on the pocket and the food isn't bad for the price. Can't complain."}
{"text":"A quaint little place in Newmarket - kind of reminiscent of the late 80s/early 90s. You can get a breakfast for $2.99 that includes 3 eggs, bacon, homefries and toast. I ordered the bacon and eggs (foregoing the homefries and toast due to my celiac). The meal was tasty and they even put tomato to feel up the blank homefry space. Waitress was quick and efficient but let us sit for ages and didn't bug us (while still keeping an eye on our table to make sure we didn't need anything). I really liked this place and judging by the constant amount of customers I'm not the only one. My only complaint is that they don't offer any kind of fruit bowl."}
{"text":"Seriously a hidden gem. I've been for breakfast three times now, and have had consistently great food and incredible service. Yes, the place is outdated but that hardly matters when you're enjoying a full breakfast for less that five bucks! 

I hesitate to recommend this place because I don't want to give away the secret but it really is great. Love the folks who own the place - so sweet."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.  There is quite the selection of food offered here.  There is plenty of parking, seating on patio or inside with a TV tuned to CP24.  Staff is very friendly and take pride is their craft.  
I indulged in their 4.49 breakfast special with the coffee add on 1.33.  Total was 6.50 amd the eggs were cooked perfectly!  Sausages had a nice snap and plenty jour juicy, the home fries had good flavour but not the hottest ( mind you I was having breakfast at 10:45am)   Even the coffee was yummy.  
I look forward to my next visit to try out their other offerings"}
