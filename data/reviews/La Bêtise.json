{"text":"Juste GÉNIAL!!! L'endroit est charmant, le personnel est sympa, ils connaissent bien le menu et savent vous conseiller. La nourriture est absolument à tomber. Originale, délicieuse, gourmande mais pas trop (juste de quoi nous donner une folle envie de commander d'autres tapas) et servie rapidement. Bref, super adresse!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Everything on the menu is delicious.  My favorite is the Salmon Tartare, but all of their tapas are just as scrumptious! Nice, understated decor and good smooth ambiance with super nice and curteous staff.  I'm thrilled this place is just a hop and a skip away from my house, makes it easier to keep coming back."}
{"text":"De bons choix et de bons plats. Bonne ambiance."}
{"text":"Délicieux. Petite trouvaille sur St-Hubert. Surtout leur tartare au saumon."}
{"text":"definitely recommend going there! food is reasonably priced and so delicious, same goes for the drinks!"}
{"text":"Belle soirée, belle ambiance décontractée.  On s'entend même parler sans avoir à hurler.  Très sympathiques tapas avec une touche asiatique à l'occasion.  Pour débuter, bouchées de crabes et goberge.  Suivis d'un succulent tartare au saumon, du boeuf au teriyaki et en final, un sympathique mac & cheese au homard. Miam, miam!  Du début à la presque fin, chaque plat était une agréable surprise.  Seul bémol, les deux desserts que nous avons commandé (crème brûlée - brownies) qui - quoique bons - étaient sur une note plus ordinaire.  La finale au mac & cheese au homard a fait en sorte que nous étions rassasiés mais peut-être que certains trouveront les portions un peu trop petites - surtout pour le boeuf.  Les prix sont corrects.  On y retourne?  Absolument."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce restaurant avec une amie lors de l'opération Montreal a table et c'est une belle découverte. Le tartare de canard est excellent et très original.
Ils proposent du kinder bueno frit en dessert... terrible... je vous conseille d'y faire un tour"}
{"text":"My friends gave me great reviews about this place, and I really enjoy tapas, so I was looking forward to try out their menu. We went there for one my friend's birthday, and they were nice enough to keep the cake I brought in the fridge. It's a rather small place, but the ambiance is nice, the staff is friendly and I enjoyed the music.

We ordered a bunch of tapas. My favorites would be the the classic salmon tartar (la betise) and the fish tacos. I really enjoyed the tartar la betise, and the taste reminded me of spicy salmon sushi. I think I would have enjoyed more if instead of deep-fried chips, they were served with nori. I was looking forward to try their octopus salad, but they were out. Other than that, I found that the other meals were ok.

As for the service, it was a bit weird. We got our tapas at various moments instead of all together, and since we were all sharing, it made us wait for the rest of the plates to come. Also, our bills were mixed up and took time to come. Price wise, if you split the bill other peeps, you can probably get of taste of 8-10 plates for around 35$, which is good.

Overall, it is a nice place, and I probably would go again, but in a smaller group for better service."}
{"text":"The lobster and bacon macpoutine (poutine week) was terribly bad; absolutely no lobster nor bacon taste, and no sauce!... Wasn' t even a poutine! There were plenty of empty tables (counted 4+) but we were told all were reserved so we decided to order to go, but there's not even room to stand."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Cute and quirky decor. Try the salmon tartar, it's WAY too good. Refreshing cocktail: Hendricks Green apple & cucumber. And for dessert, the fried Bueno, no doubt!

A good option is taking the degustation menu, it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Salmon tartare was very good. Their dishes overall had great flavors. What makes them from a 4 to 5 stars is their hospitality.  When we told him we were Tourists from San Francisco, they showed us where to go locally and even drew a map and poured us free Jamesons to show us the Montreal way! Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited as this was my first choice for their Lobster and Gravy Poutine with Homemade Tater toys. When I had arrived they were fully booked with reservations for the evening. 

I was not happy with the price and portion of the poutine. It came with very little lobster and 5 homemade tater tots. It tasted amazingly though. As well when they are cooking it does smell a bit fishy throughout the night with the seafood. But with a small place that is to be expected. 

Throughout the night the service wasn't that great as often I needed water throughout the meal. There is also only one bathroom that is shared between men and woman. So you are left waiting if it's busy. 

Overall good tasting food but too small of a portion and pricey. I could also suggest more visits to the table by the waitstaff it's a small place and there were many staff to help."}
{"text":"Belle petite place sur la rue St-Hubert. Rien pour écrire à sa mère, mais belle ambiance, un service gentil et des plats bien correcte. Si vous êtes fan de hockey, il y a même une télé qui vous présente le match."}
{"text":"1$ oysters yay! Besides that nay!

Decided to order a bunch of oysters because the price is right so why the heck not. The person who Shucked them is a pro A+. I will be back just for oysters without a doubt.

Now let's get in to the actual menu, the shrimp tempura is your basic shrimp tempura these however were heavily battered and extremely greasy, the dipping sauce wasn't good either reminded me of a milky soya sauce that should be changed asap. Then there was the beef tattaki which was bland and missing salt. The grilled octopus salad was meh and the lamb ravioli was actually just buttery dumplings with a ginger sauce they were ok but wouldn't order it again, and last but not least the mini burgers they were way over cooked and bland, needs a pickle and some mayo.

The place is beyond expensive after being handed a 200 $ bill i just laughed to myself there's way better places that this money could of been blown this place not so much. Strictly a oyster spot, and a drink spot other then that it's a pass."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés pour la poutine week. La poutine était assez décevante: pas très copieuse, très peu de homard (alors que bien sur, sur la photo, il y avait un beau morceau de homard), pour 19$...
Service ok
A un moment, quelque chose a brûlé dans la cuisine (qui est ouverte sur le resto) et ça sentait un peu le brulé dans le resto
Resto assez petit, il vaut mieux réserver..
J'y retournerai pour la table d'hôte à 35$ le soir et j'espère alors mettre 4 ou 5 étoiles... :)"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this awesome 5 a 7 hot spot located on st hubert street. This resto is a cozy small place which is great for grabbing drinks with friends and serves up some awesome cocktails...their sangria's are out of this world. Service is warm and super friendly. The resto offers incredible tapas and awesome table d'hote. They are known for their Mouth-watering salmon tartare which truly lived up to its expectations.... Truly the best in the city. Oyster dish is also awesome. Would also recommend their crab bite dish..sensational! Last but not least I recommend leaving some room for their desserts...fried dough covered with milk chocolate and served with vanilla ice cream!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Le propriétaire est très sympathique et le menu ne cesse de nous surprendre. Beau Resto qui mérite d'être essayé"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never written a review for this restaurant! I've been here maybe 3 times and loved my experience each time. Is it far from me? Yes. Is it usually winter that I go for MTL a Table or for PoutineWeek? Yes. But it's so good. I've tried many things, from the lobster mac n cheese poutine to the salmon tartare and desserts, all is delicious from what I can remember."}
{"text":"Tapas bar with an Asian twist... Love it! General Tao's Poutine is a must try.

Dynamic staff and very accommodating owner. The location is small but good enough to sit a group of 20-25 at the same table If you are looking for a private party.

Reservation is recommended on weekends."}
{"text":"We went all Asian on the night at La Bêtise. We chose to go on $1 oyster Monday, and bought the tasting menu coupon on one of the deal sites. In the end we paid around $50 per person for drinks, dozen of oysters and a crazy amount of food. We were almost too full to move at the end of the night.

For the oysters, we got Raspberry Point for the night. It was really delicious and if we didn't have the tasting menu coming, we might have just sat there and go through dozens of oysters.

The cocktails were not strong, but very tasty. And the nice presentation just lifted our spirits.

The food at La Bêtise is Asian fusion. My favorites out of the tasting menu are definitely the crab bites and salmon tartare.

The crab bites combined a whole bunch of ingredients in one bite and is just a burst of flavor in the mouth. For the salmon tartare, it has avocado and sauce in the bottom to enhance the experience.

I was really looking forward to the General Tao poutine. But when we got to that point, everyone was simply too full to enjoy the taste..."}
{"text":"Belle découverte.
J'avais envie d'huîtres et on a atterri là à 4. Un conseil réservez car il y a foule.
Huîtres très fraîches, et super bouteille de Sauvignon blanc de Loire pour commencer.
Ensuite on a essayé les cuisses de grenouilles, les bouchées de crabe, le tartare de saumon, les calamars et les Mac&Cheese au chorizo...
Tout était très bien, original et FRAIS. Pareil pour le service.
A recommander."}
{"text":"Open on Mondays serving $1 oysters, La Betise and I had a high likelihood of being friends. It's a small casual room on St Hubert below Bellechase with a few tables outside and a single booth in the back. 

The oysters were fresh and tasty, not exceptional but not problematic at all. We shared an inexpensive and very tasty bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (and then another one) while we dug into guacamole (super tasty but seemed like a mix of fresh and stale nachos on the plate;) sausage mac and cheese with quail egg (amazing flavours. so. so. good.;) General Tao poutine (crispy, yummy;) pork belly (amazing) and a beef tartare I didn't try but my friends enjoyed. 

Fun, quick, friendly service that seemed to be in close communication with the nice group of people working in the small open kitchen together. Nothing fancy in the room or tables but surprisingly good food and a nice experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for poutine week and had their \"animal style\" special. It was a spot-on homage to In-N-Out burger. I loved it. Very creative and delicious. The atmosphere is chill and the waitstaff was very friendly and attentive, too. I think it would be a great place for a date."}
{"text":"Super joint for apps. Enjoyed mini burgers and a Général Tao poutine. Man, I'm healthy. Anyway the burgers were super hot and served with a yummy house mayo. I thought about asking for ketchup for both my apps but there was really no need. Friendly service, large drink selection and as I said, hot food. Great joint."}
{"text":"Belle trouvaille.
Un peu cher au final lorsqu'on prend le menu dégustation mais on est tout de même content de pouvoir goûter à tout.  Les moules avec la salsa sont par contre très ordinaires à côté de la salade de crabe,du tartare de saumon et des mini burger à la Mayo au tobiko.  Quelle bonne idée. 
Service correct."}
{"text":"Commandes le salmon tartare! les autres je vous laisse choisir..."}
{"text":"I loved the mojito with fresh strawberry and lichee! We ordered the octopus salad, the crab bites on tortilla, the pork belly, the frog legs and the macaroni and cheese with duck asian style. Although the octopus salad was a bit too salty, the flavours and textures were very good. The crab on tortilla were good, but needed some acidity to balance the creaminess. The pork belly was just amazing! It melted in my mouth and the seasoning was perfect! The frog legs were bland and, therefore, very disappointing. The macaroni and cheese was served last. It was good, but we were almost full so it was way too rich for us. The service was very good and the staff is friendly. However, the prices are slightly expensive for the neighborhood. For eg, 12$ for the mojito before tax and tips.  Overall, I would still recommend the restaurant for their drinks and pork belly dish."}
{"text":"Service: The service is simply great. The waitress was really nice, always smiling and considerate. She also knows the menu really well and was able to answer every question we had. She also check often on us to see if everything was okay.
Score: 5/5

Food: I tried almost everything on the menu. Even though I found some plate a bit disapointing such as the lobster mac&cheese, most of the dishes were really good. The classic salmon tartare is simply amazing, as well as the filet mignon poutine. The General Tao poutine was a bit too sweet for me, but it was still good. I also really enjoyed the fried calamari. The dish came with two sauces: spicy mayo and curry mayo, both of them were good. Also, my friend is allergic to seafood, and he did not have an allergic reaction, which demonstrates the the kitchen is really careful. 
Score: 4.5/5

Drinks: La Betise has a quite good selection of drinks. I tried the Christmas Mojito, which is basically a mojito with strawberries and other fruits, it was really good. The barmaid can also do drinks that are not on the menu, as long as she knows how to do it. That night, the barmaid had a really extensive knowledge on drinks so we did not have any problem. 
Score: 5/5

Ambiance: The ambiance is really nice. They usually put some old school rap in the background, and they have a big screen inside on which you can watch hockey games. When it gets darker, the waitress put candles on the tables, which gives a perfect athmosphere for a date. But I do agree that candles and hockey games are not necessary a good match.
Score: 4.5/5

Dish you MUST order: classic salmon tartare"}
{"text":"On a découvert ce pub avec la semaine de l'huître. Un plateau pour 10$ avec un cocktail, rien à dire, délicieuse et les accompagnement d'assaisonnement. On a pris ensuite un plateau pour 4 avec Poutine, mini-burger, côté d'agneau, ravioli et porc. Le tout était parfaitement assaisonné, le mini-burger était délicieux avec ses ufs de poissons qui accompagnait le buf, le porc était tendre et fondant, la poutine était sucré/salé, l'agneau était plus mitigé, il remplaçait le buf annoncé sur la carte. Pour 72$ c'était un peu limite niveau quantité mais la qualité était au rendez vous.  Concernant le décor, cela ressemble au nouveau bar/resto qui fleurisse sur Montreal,  cuisine ouvert sur la sale qui peu accueillir 30-35 personnes avec un décor métal/bois. Un bon moment, nous y retournerons sûrement."}
{"text":"I would recommend a reservation.

I went there with Oystermania coupons on a date, and it was near perfect. The wine menu keeps it simple and affordable, the oysters were delicious, and everything I ate was pretty tasty.

Highlight goes to the truffle oil salmon tartare, it tasted like pure love, with caviar sprinkled on top.

My only slight critique regards the fish tacos, it's always better with marinated fish as opposed to fried stuff.

Our waiter was friendly and attentive, the space is small but comfy, the only thing I didn't like was the loud hockey game playing, but I have to disclose that: I'm a grumpy old man."}
{"text":"We ordered 8 tapas for 4 girls like the waitor suggested. It was way too much. 6 wouldve been perfect. So, the food started off really yummy - crab bites, beef filet mignon, salmon and octopus salad (if im not mistaken). Then went downhill with the frog legs, chicken bites and mac n cheese. It wasnt so bad but the first 4, i loved! Service is great and staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Un très bon restaurant. Déco sympa et conviviale. Je n'ai pas mis la note maximal car un peu cher mais cela s'explique par la qualité des aliments. Également un peu bruyant mais le concept du restaurant et la petite taille de celui-ci ne sont pas propice au calme. Le tartare de saumon est excellent et la soupe du chef délicieuse. Les desserts sont très bons, soignés et innovants. Un peu déçu cependant par le choix des tapas qui n'était pas énormément fourni. L'accueil et le service ont été irréprochable et rapide. Je reviendrais sans hésiter."}
