{"text":"Tried the butter chicken and samosas on more than one occasion.

Butter chicken is on the spicy side unlike butter chicken from other places, which tends to be sweet. Not saying that it's bad, but its different from normal butter chicken. Didn't skimp on sauce or chicken, so that's good. Normal pricing though, around $10 for a portion that feeds 2 people.

Vegetable samosas are highly recommended. $0.75 each, but they fry them upon order so when they come out they are piping hot and super crispy.

I'd recommend doing take out because the tables aren't exactly sparkling clean. Decor is a bit sparse and feels run down, but that's to be expected of a small business.

Overall, solid place for Indian food. Okay food at normal prices. Visit if you're in the neighbourhood but not good enough to warrant purposely driving here for."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food ! 5/5 for taste great dishes like butter chicken, and chicken curries korma and vindaloo (very spicy). Yummy white chicken breast meat and generous portions for very decent prices! We went before closing and the food and naan was very fresh tasting! 
Service was good, friendly !
Took some time to prepare the food but given how yummmy it was I didn't mind! Left some time for conversation with company which is always good! 

Give it a try! 
Ps more of a fast food feel, many customers come in for take out, heard a lot of phone orders! Give it a try you won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I got the chicken tikka wrap for $5 and it was so worth it. Buying a wrap from indian places can be a little risky- however this one was a fresh naan and the garnishes were amazing as well.

Great value- Great Deal."}
{"text":"This is just an amazing place!!! The food is beyond good, and the proprietors and very friendly.  I really can't recommend it enough.  You really need to try it!!'"}
