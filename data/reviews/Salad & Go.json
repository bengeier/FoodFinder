{"text":"I usually grab dinner from here at least twice a week. They have super friendly staff at this location and they usually have my salad ready before I can even pull my wallet out.  I definitely recommend the Greek salad and BBQ salad.  The portions are large and the dressings they use are very tasty and unique.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and I keep going to all the locations in Arizona valley! Thanks for the great service and yummy food"}
{"text":"Everyone is always nice, going through the drive through is always quick. I hope to see more vegan options like faux meat, dairy free cheese and whatnot!"}
{"text":"This place makes great salads. They have many different ones to choose from, but you can customize however you want!!"}
{"text":"I had issues with a Salad & Go in Gilbert years ago and vowed never to return but I thought I would give it another go in Mesa.  Again the chicken was dry and overcooked and the balsamic had an unusual taste.  I paid $7.76 for a basic salad w/ chicken and it was basically the same salad size you would get at Panera if you order a 1/2 salad.  For about $1 more you can get a fresh salad with fresh chicken at Panera and you are able to relax in a comfortable environment with WIFI!  I will never return to Salad & GO and will advise others to avoid.  This place is way overrated and overpriced!"}
