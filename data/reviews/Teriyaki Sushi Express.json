{"text":"This place is excellent! My son brought some home yesterday I tasted it and it was amazing! I went back today myself and they had good customer service, the place was clean, but the food.........was great again! My new favorite place! Not to mention the best egg roll I ever had!"}
{"text":"There teriyaki here is waaay better than the mall's & for the cost, you get a great portion.  The spicy shrimp tempura roll is delicious too, for a quick sushi fix.  Overall good food, especially for a lunch break!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews or anything like this ,but is sad to see the person that did the first review how bias is ,and you can tell right away when she said quality mall that she is related to them or there is something else. I've being in the mall ,and this guys used to work there ,so basically what you get here is what you are going to get there, for me the biggest example of this place is a great place is because is always busy, and when a place is not good you are never going to see as many costumers as you see here. the cleanliness and  quality of the food is awesome ,and the espress is probably because is super fast. is not that they are taking short cuts and give you bad or uncooked food. please visit this place ,and don't let the negative comment from the other costumer  that clearly is not fair in her comment."}
{"text":"I love this place.   I always get the teriyaki chicken with veggies and extra chicken, and a drink. Under 10 dollars. Not to mention Great service!   
They give you tons of food, so I usually split it with my boyfriend. 
   Food is hot, very consistent flavor!   Wait us usually about 10 minutes, but they make it after you order, so that is expected. 
I have also had sushi from here, and I didn't get a stomach ache, so that says a lot!  They did a great job and the presentation was as good as the price.   Love that I live so close to this place."}
{"text":"I got the Chicken Teriyaki to dine in.  For whatever reason they gave it to me in styrofoam, along with a cup for water, as well as a plastic fork.  I asked if they recycled any of the styrofoam or plastic, to which they said they do not, so I took it home with me to recycle on my own.  Minus points for that, but it explains why their costs are lower than expected.

The meal itself wasn't great.  The chicken quality was mediocre-to-poor, I found myself half way through the meal picking through the \"good\" pieces of chicken and losing my appetite.  The teriyaki sauce was quite bland and too salty.  I prefer the chicken to be broiled with light charring to give a crispy texture.  I won't knock points for preference, but I will for the chicken quality and lack of flavor.

The place itself seems somewhat unkempt.  The bathroom (men's) was pretty gross, I almost felt dirtier after going in there which is never a good sign.  

All in all, I won't be back.  It's cheap food but they cut corners on quality and have no environmental conscience integrated to their business model.  I have a hard time supporting such establishments.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Stopped in to take a look at their menu. The cook/owner gave me a free sample of their chicken teriyaki and, when I ordered it, offered it to me on the house. I'll definitely return as a paying customer!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Very well priced. Great for dine in or carry out. I don't say this very often but the service was amazing. Very friendly hard working people.  We are so happy to have found our new sushi spot! The reviewer needs to give it another try!"}
{"text":"Well, this place is close to my house and that's why I visit here often. But in the past few visits, I am getting disappointed. They just don't give enough soy sauce with the sushi. I usually get a take-out and the soy sauce was almost 1/4th of the tiny box they give. If I have to use the soy sauce in my house then what's the point in paying for the whole item. My favorite sushi places are far and that's why I take sushi from here. But I guess they are about to lose a customer. I don't even feel like leaving a tip anymore but I still do it!- Disappointed customer!"}
{"text":"This place is quite a steal for the price of the food.  Don't come here expecting the best sushi you've ever had. That being said, most of the sushi rolls are pretty good for the price. I particularly like the unagi roll. The spicy tuna roll was definitely a letdown though and was overpowered by the chili paste they used.

The actual highlights I'd say would be the other options. Their teriyaki and bento box options are delicious and you get a lot for what you pay for. I'll definitely come here often when I need a quick fix of Japanese food and don't want to pay the premium price."}
{"text":"Yes to this place all day every day!!!!

If you're looking to stretch your dollar, this is the place to do so.  I was simply looking for a bento box in Madison that didn't cost and arm and a leg and stumbled upon Teriyaki Sushi Express.  What a find!

The portions are HUGE for what you pay and their food can only be described as super scrumptious!  I have had their bento box, the yakisoba, and the fried rice.  Boy oh boy.  Each dish was simply Heaven on the tongue.  I especially love that everything is made to order and you can watch the chef in action as he prepares your meal.

My boyfriend won't stop talking about this place and keeps asking when we're going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! You would think that being a carry out place, the food would be just ok, but this place has an awesome quality of food at great prices. I recently discovered this place and have been coming here several times during the week. I always get my fav. Shrimp tempura roll and my fianc√© likes the teriyaki chicken with rice. They also have this habenero sauce which makes the sushi taste really good. You have to try the sushi, it's the best one in Madison. A must go place with great customer service!"}
{"text":"I want to be careful in my review. I'll keep it simple. If you want sushi you never should choose a place that has \"Express\" in the restaurant name. If you're looking for some fried rice, some teriyaki chicken, then okay, they do that, but mall food quality. The two guys that were running the place when I was there were nice. Just don't expect high quality. This is express teriyaki."}
{"text":"After one meal, this is now my favorite food place in Madison. The food itself was pretty good, but the speed, price, serving size, and attitude among the staff were all on par with the best. My $8 box of chicken teriyaki with extra chicken seemed like about 3 20-year-old-males' worth of food. I feel like my poor S.O. is buried in 3, 4, maybe even 5 meals-worth of leftovers from her Beef Yakisoba! xD Actually, not really a \"problem\" per se - More of a comically ridiculous blessing. The whole experience of ordering, watching our food being prepared, paying for our order, and heaping praise on the staff took about 5 minutes.

I'd say it'd be tough to find a better \"weekly-staple\" restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"I am really happy with the quality of the food. Price is all right, not the best sushi in madison for sure but not bad also. Come here for the teriyaki."}
{"text":"I ordered from here because I thought it looked really good and it was good prices for bento. The other reviewers are right the teriyaki chicken is exactly like Sarku Japan in the East town mall, as well as the fried rice and vegetables. The rest of the bento was actually pretty good but was somewhat unremarkable. Something that weirds me out is the temperature shrimp was extremely long approximately 6 inches I'm questioning if it was actually shrimp or some other crustacean. But I digress for its price it was pretty decent but nothing remarkable so I can't really feel comfortable giving it more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent little sushi shop! Their eel rolls are incredible! This is the perfect restaurant for sushi lovers that are on the go, or on lunch break, etc. Very friendly staff. Clean establishment. Plenty of parking. Decent prices. All around great place! A+"}
{"text":"I love this place! I recently moved in the area, and saw this place as I was driving by. I decided to stop and give it a try. I'm very happy I did. The food and service here was great. Is this a fancy sit down restaurant? No it is not. Is the service and food good? Yes, it absolutely is. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"5 stars for takeout. Quality, service and especially portions are outstanding."}
{"text":"Good food and very nice staff. They made a small mistake on my order, remade the order and gave a double order and a free soda.  Small things like that make the difference."}
{"text":"I read the reviews of this location and decided to stop by myself since it is on my way home.  Pulling into the parking lot I noted it is in a strip mall next to a Little Caesar's and across from a DQ, so I did not expect Muramoto level sushi.  I think to honestly rate this restaurant it must be based on how well they do what they do.  And for roughly $6 entrees and around $8-10 for a sushi roll, I don't feel I was paying too much for what I got.  I do think the comparison can be made to the Japanese restaurant in the mall as the dishes are pretty much the same type and all served the same way in a styrofoam container.  I ordered the green dragon roll, which is on par with most \"express\" places.  So so flavor, good size portion and what I would get for the same price more or less at Whole Foods or Metcalfs.  I also tried the teriyaki beef, which I found to be similar to the mall fast food restaurant except that it lacked flavor and was not the rich teriyaki taste I was hoping for.  It was however a very large portion.  In addition, the staff is very friendly and the restaurant appeared clean.  

To sum it up, I disagree with giving this restaurant a low score based on an unreasonable expectation of obtaining excellent sushi at a strip mall sushi express, however I also do not feel that in comparison to other similar fast food locations this deserves 5 stars.  I will likely not return, as it is not to my taste, but if you are looking for fast food Japanese and do not want to go to a mall, this place will do just fine."}
{"text":"Stopped there for lunch today looking forward to trying sushi from a new Madison restaurant.  I was looking forward to the rainbow roll ($8.99) and the spicy tuna roll (can't recall the price for sure, maybe $5.99).  Imagine my disappointment when they told me they didn't have any sushi available.

At the time we were there, there was only one person working.  He was both running the grill and taking orders.  He said the rice wasn't ready.  Not only did that eliminate the sushi rolls but also the bento boxes.  It would have been nice if there was some sort of indication of this upon walking in as we had to wait several minutes before he was available to take our orders.

I ended up going with the teriyaki tofu and hubby got the yakisoba.  Just as other users have reported, the portions were generous and it was tasty.  Although we were asked if lunch was for here or to go, the food still came in a styrofoam container even though we ate there in one of the booths.  So unsure what the difference would have been had we ordered it to go.

We definitely didn't walk away hungry, just a little disappointed just due to the whole experience.  We would go back but likely not any time soon since their location isn't particularly convenient for us and we don't know when sushi might be available."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed this place? Really? Ok. Let's do this, Teriyaki Sushi Express. You get to be my 100th review. Woo! Ok, down to the review. The best thing here is the sriracha mayo sauce. It really hooked me in. It's just so good. I tried to get them to tell me for years what the secret was. They would never tell me, but oh ho ho I figured out their tricksy little secret. Now I too can make the best sriracha mayo around. This has turned me into such a snob when it comes to that. So I have to give them props for making me upset with every other restaurant that has better quality sushi, but low quality sriracha mayo. Speaking of, the sushi isn't exactly the best, but it's really good for cheap sushi. Their teriyaki is also, of course, delicious. As is the tempura. They really pack a huge portion into those to-go boxes. Generally I prefer to sit down, although I have no idea why because I always end up hating it. There always seems to be children running around screaming with disinterested parents watching the tv. For some reason I always forgot to mention this place to friends. Eventually when I thought of it, turns out they already knew! Seems a good deal of people I know have discovered this place on their own and love it just as much. The food is great and for some reason I forgive all of the flaws and am semi-addicted. They can get a five star when the inside is less noisy with kids."}
{"text":"Okay, maybe I'm just a sucker for value but, man, is this place worth it. I usually order the chicken teriyaki with fried rice and vegetables (or just with extra vegetables and no rice if I'm feeling healthier) and it's always a struggle both to finish it because of the portion sizes and to not finish it because of how yummy it is.

Sometimes the wait is long because they make your food to order and because, I've noticed, they usually get large call-in orders. I also once got the vegetable tempura -- it tasted fine but, in terms of quantity, it wasn't really worth it at all. And I did try their sushi once; it was a little below average and took a very, very long time for them to make.

In short, you can't go wrong with the teriyaki here. For me, it's enough to overlook this place's other shortcomings. It's tasty and so worth it."}
{"text":"Coming from enjoying teriyaki places that sprinkle the Pacific Northwest I was excited to see this place! While my expectations were low it fits the bill for strip mega meals. I got a lot of food. A lot of so so food. It wasn't like it was bad. But it wasn't broiled or chared enough for my liking. The sauce was decent but a little on the salty side. 
I ordered the two piece crab Rangoon for funsies but was charged for two orders of crab Rangoon. Being shy I didn't say anything when I didn't understand the price I was told so I handed the man my credit card. Then I saw the receipt for 15! I though dear god I am going to be stuck with so many left overs. Then another man came over and asked if I wanted two orders of the Rangoon and I said well I wanted the two piece order. He said do you want me to take this back? I was like no I paid for both so I want both now lol"}
{"text":"This place is a local spot for fast food teriyaki, sushi, yakisoba, and bento boxes. The teriyaki meals come with your choice of protein and are packed with freshly griddled veggies. If your team is ready or you are extra hungry the teriyaki plates are great, asking for double meat is a local favorite and it is essential when spitting in two. The yakisoba is surprisingly traditional and full of protein, veggies, grilled noodles, and even comes with soy sauce, Srirachi, and Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise. 

The Mexican cooks running this joint even have a \"Macho sauce for Macho Men\" and it is habanero spiked, very tasty, and delivery the heat.

The beto boxes options are pretty cool if you want to try a bit of everything they have to offer. Overall the prices are very reasonable, the staff are friendly, and they give samplers of some items if you are unsure about what you want."}
{"text":"Ugh. I'm from Seattle and spoiled. 

I've been CRAVING Teriyaki for months now and finally caved by typing \"best teriyaki in madison\" into the ever knowing Google search bar on my phone.

I mean...this was standard teriyaki - but not Seattle grade Teriyaki. Also, the strip mall this place is located is pretty sketch. Between a Radio Shack (so those are still a thing) and liquor store. I wasn't concerned for my safety...but I wasn't NOT concerned either.

I would need to be CRAVING Teriyaki again to come back."}
{"text":"Came in with my SO on a Thursday and he ordered a roll and I had a teriyaki chicken with a side of fried rice.


The best thing I can say to describe the food I had was that it tasted old. The fried rice tasted like over cooked chicken rice that had been reheated with some oil. It was made with frozen peas and carrots. The actual chicken portion tasted like chicken. 



SO's roll seemed okay, but didn't seem to be the right temperature. The fish seemed lukewarm and the wrapper was moist, like it had been made a bit ago and was just waiting around for someone to order it."}
{"text":"Seems to be a small hole in the wall with good food.  I took this place as a \"fast food sushi house\".  Nothing fact about this place...just decent sushi.  If your looking for something quick and good, this is the place.  It does have a small limited menu."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place deserves more than 1 star but given my last experience here, I'm deeply concern about the sanitation of the food and therefore am warning others to beware.

However, my last experience here, there was a short strand of hair in the salad and that was extremely disappointing since I ate it before realizing it. Obviously, I spat out that bite and didn't touch the salad at all, but needless to say, my appetite was ruined. I really do hope this is a single occurrence and that no other patrons may have to suffer eating hair. This is when we noticed the cooks weren't wearing hairnets and the sanitariness of the place just went down immediately. 

Additionally, we ordered a cup of green tea and it came out in a cheap styrofoam cup and didn't taste good. For the time being, I'd be avoiding this place since despite the rest of the meal usually tastes good. I can't risk eating someone's hair again, it just grosses me out thinking about it."}
{"text":"Outstanding restraunt. Never in my wildest dreams could I have predicted how much food you can get for such a great price. This location does not skimp out on portion sizes. Overall great location with a talented cook staff. If I ate out more this would be my regular spot."}
{"text":"You guys.  I know the sushi purists out there are like \"no way am I buying sushi from a place in a strip mall.\"  That's fine, because you're leaving more space for the rest of us.  The staff are friendly and accommodating and clearly take pride in their work; the sushi, teriyaki and yakisoba are among the best I've had, and the prices are fantastic.  Not sure about one of the reviews that mentions hair in the food; I've been several times and it's always extremely clean and hygenic.  My kids had a blast watching the chef make our food on the big flat top griddle and he was really sweet in engaging with them while he made the food - even did a few spatula tricks to make them laugh. :-) Did I mention that the food is SO GOOD??? Nice depth of flavor, fresh ingredients and taste.  I'm not a sushi purist so maybe I just have lower standards...which again is fine, because there will be more spicy tuna rolls for me from Teriyaki Sushi Express!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for takeout. They serve some basic sushi rolls, tempura, and a teriyaki rice dish with your choice of protein. You get this with a minimal salad for just over 10 bucks, a pretty filling meal in a bento box.

Pros:
Tempura was good-- though a bit lukewarm when I got it.
Sushi was passable, as expected for a place like this-- I only saw rolls with some shrimp or crab and veggies. Better than a grocery store, but not amazing.
They have a good drink selection which includes Jarritos, AKA that one mexican soda AKA green drank.
Salad was small and simple with a tasty dressing.

Cons:
It took a while to get our food, so I may do takeout next time. 
I didn't care too much for my teriyaki tofu dish, there just wasn't much flavor even with the chicken fried rice. Maybe some vegetables would be in order here? (Peas in the fried rice do not really count)
Minor nitpick-- The lights in there are super fluorescent, maybe time to invest in some filters.

Vegetarian rating-- 2/5 stars. The tempura (minus the shrimp) and tofu with white rice might be your best bet here."}
