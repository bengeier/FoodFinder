{"text":"So bad decision to have curry at a pizza place. Was spicy as hell and the one chicken curry had full out wings and drummets  floating in it. If you are hankering a late night snack I would place a safer bet on the pizza.  I can say for 100% certainty the canned pop was delicious."}
{"text":"You may have seen this place if you are hangin out on 1st street while at the clubs along there.  It is one of those places that has the greasy smell inside, that greasy good kind of smell.... The pizza here is quite tasty.  The sauce is not spicy but flavourful and the crust is my favourite in the city. It is slightly sweet and delicious!!!  The staff behind the counter are nice guys, especially considering the amount of drunk clubgoers that come in here on the weekend.  They have more than just pizza, they have potato wedges too. 
The inside of the place is nothing to write home about.... its actually a bit of a dive, but you arent there for the ambience...if you want a good slice ( $3) late at night this is the place to go.
Dont be intimidated by if you see people hangin out in the parking lot, they are usually tanked and harmless!  :)
Good pizza, good prices."}
{"text":"I came because I was starving, literally had no time to eat all day! So the taste I remember might be a little biased because of that BUT honestly this place had really decent, honest to goodness pizza! Call it workin man's pizza !

Now I got it by the slice, I ordered three slices two hawaiin(one of my faves) and also the meat loaded variety. It was great! Nice crisp bottom with chewy and flavorful dough. The sauce was good! The cheese and toppings pretty average and decent. I would come here in a heartbeat of I was in the area and needed a quick and satisfying bite. Then again I would go to any pizza place that happens to be around hahaha but I am glad this one was a good one!!
