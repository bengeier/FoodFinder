{"text":"Excelente servicio las mejores fresas con cremas cuando te atiende la muchacha mucho mejor nose como se llama pero pregunten por ella!"}
{"text":"I've tried the nuez and fresa hoping for them to be delicious. But the flavor is a bit off. The shaved ice is great and the lechera over it is amazing but the flavor itself seems off. I can't pin point it, it's not terrible but still manageable to eat regardless. I haven't tried anything else besides the raspados. Overall the service was fast and the workers are very friendly and knowledgeable. The place is clean and the menu is easy to understand"}
{"text":"This place is great when you are in craving for some treats. The staff were very friendly! I tried their raspados and were very good. I will definitely be going back to try more."}
{"text":"I haven't had the shaved ice, I had instead corn in a cup, which compared to other places was a little pricey. I also had a \"duro con verduras\" which to my surprise it only had sour cream, carrots, cheese and strings of pork (cueritos). It was the simplest treat I've ever had and it wasn't even good, it had no avocado, no cabbage or tomatoes. I was very disappointed. Definitely not going there again."}
{"text":"I love the botana especial it is so good and it's such a great price! The seafood is so fresh!! After that I had to have something sweet and they had the best natural flavored raspados in the area. Believe me I know good raspados!"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night at 6pm, business hours said it was open and it was NOT open! I called the number and no one answered. They should post up business hours on door and update it on here."}
{"text":"Stopped by with the family and the lights were on but the door was locked at 10pm. Yet, the hours say 11pm closing time. Disappointed, no fresas con crema tonight."}
{"text":"This place was soo good! Everything we got was huge portions. Friendly and clean place with lots of options!"}
{"text":"We have tried to try this spot multiple times and they are never open. Tried again today and they said they opened at ten went after noon and it's closed."}
{"text":"I have only tried the shaved ice but it's really really good! They just opened and they are very welcoming and professional! I will come again soon because I love me a shaved ice. I will try the ice cream next time and update the review!"}
