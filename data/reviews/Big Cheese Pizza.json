{"text":"New pizza place off 91 and 90.   Tried it last week and was presently impressed.  The pizza was good and the salad was hearty.  It is a take out and delivery shop, not sure if you can eat inside.  Overall a good place to grab a pie.  Will return."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I had to download Yelp just to post. Waited for 5 min at counter, no one in store"}
{"text":"We just ordered pizza from them for the second time, and just like the first time, it was delicious! You dare not order double cheese unless you're trying to have a heart attack! They're regular pizza is super cheesy and super filling. We requested delivery and paid by credit card over the phone. We were given a 40 minute delivery window, but the food was at our doorstep in less than 25 (we are about 1 1/2 miles from the shop.) Would highly recommend this new little pizza joint over any of the big chain stores any day!"}
{"text":"We're pizza freaks! Normally we order from the larger chains but being newer to the area we wanted to see what else Willoughby has to offer. We fell in love with big cheese the first time we ordered from them. We haven't ordered anything we didn't like. Their pizza is fabulous, their Stromboli's are even better. (Order both the red and white sauce!) Hubby loves their spicy garlic wings and sandwiches. Also they give generous portions at great prices. We love living so close to this pizza shop and order often, just wish they were open a little later."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place, I called in my order for delivery even though we live right across the street. We ordered a large pepperoni Pizza with mushrooms and extra cheese, a chicken tenders dinner and 2 chocolate chip cookies. They told us our order would be ready in 35 to 45 mintues.  1st awesome thing- our food arrived very fast- 26 mins to be exact.  2nd awesome thing- their large Pizza is huge! Most of the time a large Pizza from a local business can be a crap shoot. Best pizza in downtown Willoughby has a large that is a joke- so this was an awesome surprise.  3rd awesome thing- their sauce and crust is amazing! The sauce is just a hint sweet. I can't stand spicy sauce or sauce that has so much acid I breathe fire. And the crust is nice and soft, not hard as a rock. But it's not soggy either. It's just right.  4th awesome thing- it was hot when it came to my door. I can't stand cold pizza.   My boyfriends fires were a tad on the cold side but he said he liked them and his chicken tenders were pretty good and hot. The cookies were pretty tasty too. Safe to say, this will be our new Pizza place until they give us a reason to look else where"}
{"text":"They could use some work on there bread very soggy, this maybe good and natural on a Irish field. However, his is pizza and it should be dryish and flaky like the fields of bari Italy. Light yet barley moist, subtle crunch at the end.    Cajun fries are okay though."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice. I wanted to like this place, but unfortunately the pizza has a weird texture - too soft on the bottom. It's better pizza when it's cold. They give a huge portion for spaghetti, but the meatballs and sauce weren't good. Won't be going back."}
