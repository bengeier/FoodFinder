{"text":"LOVE; the hot wings!  LIKE; the delicious pizza! Always ready fast! DISLIKE; nothing, although some may not like that it's in a gas station. Idc."}
{"text":"I wanted to try someplace new so I gave Lefty's a try.  The food was delivered promptly by a very friendly driver, and everything was fresh and hot.  The chicken fingers were nice and crispy, and their fries were delicious and salty.  The pizza was good, but the crust towards the outside was pretty dry.  The ingredients and toppings were plentiful."}
{"text":"The manager billy is the worst. He's super rude and doesn't know how to handle things like a manager! They need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"Great food, great vibes, great service  Their food made me extremely horny ! Right when the pizza touched my lips it felt like I climaxed ! That's how good this stuff is right here"}
{"text":"You have to try their pizza - quality meat and the crust isn't over powering. Perfect ratio of crust to toppings"}
{"text":"Great pizza and fingers. My order was, however, incorrect. 3 different basic pizzas and fingers, and a 2 liter.   I received the 3 pizzas, but 2 were correct while the third was incorrect. No need to correct the order, but a little attention to detail on tickets goes a really long way.   Keep up the great work though!"}
{"text":"Received a flier on our door. Figured we would try to give them a shot to show support for local businesses. Called and tried to place an order, but the guy on the phone was laughing and totally messing around with people in the background. He completely ignored me trying to get his attention. Tried calling back to speak to a manager and there wasn't one on duty. Explains a lot..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town , love the chicken fingers , onion rings and their homemade ranch is delish ! Plus the manager is super hot"}
{"text":"This is truly NY pizza, originally from NY and moved here because of military and nothings better than a taste of home.  Garlic knots are good, don't know about the wings but considering my 6yr old boy ate the entire order of them and some I'll assume they were also good.  Had a plain pie as well as a meatball pie and both are awesome.  They've got, cracked pepper, Parmesan cheese and garlic shakers at the table.  (legit). Not the best place to dine-in because its not very big but take the pies and sides home and you'll still have a great taste of NY pizza, best pizza outside the NY area...hands down."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza here on four occasions. I got a meat lovers pizza that was delicious!  I asked for thin crust.  The  dough is hand tossed so the crust was not as thin as I like it to be, however, it was still delicious. The wings were also yummy, crispy and well done.  I will definitely order from them next time I come to town!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst pizza I have ever had. The crust was hard and chewy and the toppings just slid right off and were pretty bland. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!  In Jersey you can find good pizza on every corner, this is just like the Pizza back home.  Great job!  Not a sit in kind of place although there are a couple of tables.  Great for take out or delivery and the guys working there are real nice."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The only place in the valley with anything close to true blue NY style pizza."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here... Best in Vegas and luckily right around the corner from me.  We get pizza here at least once a week. I love that it's in a place you'd never expect it.   Shhhhhh, it's a secret!  I brag to friends and everyone at work that it's the best and if I run in to any East coasters that are homesick for pizza, I always send them here.    The guys are great.  Take out or delivery...  They make custom orders to your liking and are honest friendly guys.  They suggested I buy my soda in the Rhino Mart becasue it was cheaper.  That earns my respect and loyalty!"}
{"text":"Tastes fine for the price. Just wish they actually coated their chicken tenders in sauce and not deliver chicken with virtually no sauce on it. Should have gotten my money back."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza out there. The staff is always friendly and the food is always hot, fresh, and tasty. They even throw in some extras every once in a while to show you how much they care about your business. When you order a \"medium\" it doesn't mean ALMOST medium, it means medium or more. To me that shows the dedication these guys have to their clients."}
{"text":"Ordered take out through Yelp/Eat24 services.  The place is close to home, so I had some hopes for it.  But there is nothing notable here.  Corporate franchise joints are better than this place.  They did call me when the food was ready, that was nice.  I ordered mozzarella sticks and a stromboli (pepperoni, sausage, garlic). The sticks were completely bland and unseasoned, and the stromboli simply had some oregano on top.  There was nothing unique or seasoned about the meat or bread.  Fortunately the meat sauce was okay, so that helped me get some food down, but I only ate half of my food before quitting.  I wouldn't return to this place, even if i was in a bind.  I'd just get some frozen pizzas from the store.  To put things in perspective- Sonic's breadsticks are better seasoned, and I'd make the drive Joe's New York Pizza next time."}
{"text":"So I notice that there were 5 stars rating so I figure maybe they got new cooks or I ordered on a bad night and tried them again... It is still the worst food I've ever had...the owner had to ask all friends and family to review .... The food is flat out nasty!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the only pizza delivery joint on the south side worth a damn. For some strange reason a good pie is hard to come by in Vegas. Big fan and long time customer :)  If you live in Silverado Ranch, this should be your pizza shop!"}
{"text":"I don't know what Angelica V. is talking about. She must have got fired from Lefty's or something. On a brighter note in 2007 i moved to Las Vegas to work for an Ad Agency, i hated the heat, the fact that everything was so far away and lack of mom and pop places. Having been and being from California, i have not found a place even in New York that could top their calzones, jesus christ even their spaghetti is great, the sauce is made fresh and with tlc.   OMG! I swear this is not bs and my mouth is watering just thinking of taking a 4 hour drive to get a Pizza, Calzone, Stromboli, and some spaghetti. oh and their cowboy burger is good too but i stuck to the italian stuff. One of the only reasons i enjoyed my stay in Vegas and still go back and they me as the guy from California, lol."}
{"text":"Just order from here! You will like it! They are great to deal with and always willing to go the extra mile. I got the sausage and it was fantastic. I love to see local places do good."}
{"text":"I love Leftys pizza. It reminds me of  pizza  that used to get at this one place when I was a kid back east."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time. Excellent! Will def be using them again! We ordered the whitey pizza. They're just missing the crushed pepper packs and Parmesan packs."}
{"text":"I have only had the Pizza here so excuse me if my review isn't thorough. I've eaten at at least a dozen local (family owned) pizza joints in Vegas so YES there will be comparisons.  Their pizza is decent. Nothing to write home about. I had a 1/2 cheese, 1/2 pepperoni since this is the first time and this is the base test for any pizza place. Their crust is pretty bland. The toppings are OK but they use a tad too much seasoning with the garlic and oregano. Their buttermilk ranch dressing is pretty good though. I just wish they gave you a larger cup of it because, even with 2 of those little cups it's not enough for a 16 inch pizza."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Pizza and wings are great. Their spaghetti came with a combo I ordered once and i have to say that was not good however, I didn't go there for pasta. While the staff could be friendlier (never rude, just not very warm), the pizza and wings are on point! Highly recommend Lefty's."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery the girl on the phone was really short with me and the food is really blah. I ordered BBQ chicken pizza and chicken parm sandwich. The BBQ sauce is horrible, it had a real funky taste but the crust was good for what it counts and the chicken parm was boring no seasonings but was more edible then the pizza. First and last time ordering there unfortunately."}
{"text":"I had this pizza the first time at a friends house. It was so good so I inquired where this place was. Looks can be deceiving. It's in a gas station. I had passed there many times but never even considered stopping. Staff is friendly, pizza is great."}
{"text":"I had the Meat Lovers and if I was rating pizzas on weight this would be #1. The cheese and bread are OK but the sauce is so plain it's pathetic for a restaurant."}
{"text":"I called an order in, 30 min in advance and when I show up to pick up my order nothing had been cooked there excuse was that they were waiting for me to pay smh since when do you have to pay when you call an order in? The point is not to sit and wait terrible customer service and food sucked!!"}
{"text":"This mom and pop style neighborhood pizza joint is located in a gas station, old baseball pictures on the walls, good pizza for the price the staff is really chill. This place won't disappoint you, much better than the garbage at cici's or any corporate pizza place. The wings are really good and they also have pizza by the slice. If you live in the area, this should be your usual pizza spot. It's an old school spot not really meant for the whole family to come and eat but more of a take out New York style pizza joint or maybe good to eat a slice there and BS with staff."}
{"text":"I order from this place pretty often, and it's great! It's inside a gas station but you would never notice unless you went to pick up. Great sauce, AMAZING garlic knots and wings.. And the price is great! Their delivery is super fast & service is always good!"}
{"text":"Boneless chicken wings are so amazing they literally melt in your mouth! Best ever! Pizza is soft and not full of grease."}
{"text":"This is my families go to for pizza!! I think we get the babe Ruth every time and their wings are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Consistent and good pizza. My go to Vegas pizza. Great price and always tasty when i pick it up."}
{"text":"Love this place! Yeah it's in a gas station but who cares when the food is good. Pizza tastes great, thin handmade crust is delicious! We always order a combo ($39.99 for 2 one item pizzas, bucket of wings or fingers, 2 liter of soda that comes with free spaghetti or salad) the pizzas are huge and the meal is plentY!"}
{"text":"The best pizza ever and will continue to eat their. All my friend that had it think the same thing"}
{"text":"A tasty hole-in-the-wall joint attached to a gas station.  Stopped in and feed the boy a with a $5.99 two pepperoni slice with medium drink special.  The service was friendly and the pizza was tasty."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and the person taking the order did not have the best customer service but that also could be because my reception wasn't stellar...  The pizza took a solid hour to be delivered but it was pretty damn good!  The supreme pizza we got was thin crust, crunchy with a good blend of toppings, cheese and sauce.   The only negative spot was the salad.  It was horrendous.  Definitely get a pizza from here, but skip the salad."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time and man, where has this place been all my life??!! This is now my new favorite pizza place. The ingredients are fresh, the toppings are plentiful and the staff is super friendly! I won the Sunday family pizza wars and will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I love the taste of the pizza here.  Always get pepperoni & sausage, & I like the burst of flavor from their seasonings."}
{"text":"The pizza here is great - I've had the babe Ruth with no onions and that was terrific. Tonight I had the Hawaiian which isn't on the menu but they have ham and pineapples.  I don't get all serious about the Canadian bacon like a few of my friends.... it was all excellent. I would check out their online specials first to see what works with your budget and appetite. Delivery can be over an hour at times so heads up for that too."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here. I was skeptical about the location. (It's in a gas station.) After hearing from a few people that the place was good, I tried it. I was pretty impressed. It's no \"east coast\" pizza but it's pretty good for this side of the country. It's a perfect place for pick up or delivery but don't recommend for a sit down. Way too small for that. Overall - I would recommend to others! The BBQ chicken pizza is really good. I also like the garlic knots."}
{"text":"Omg there pizza is good must better than Pizza Hut dominoes or any of those I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"Moved into the area and have been trying different pizza places. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and wings and garlic knots. They delivered it in a timely manner but the food itself was just ok. The crust was this but super hard and the wings were not crispy but kind of mushy. The garlic knots we're good.  I will probably keep looking for a pizza place to become our regular."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot in all of Vegas. If you want a thin, cheese pizza that is the perfect combo of dough, cheese and sauce and cooked just right, hands down theirs is the best!"}
{"text":"I've never been here but have ordered thru Yelp several times - delivery timing has been pretty consistent and as expected, and the food's not bad for delivery pizza either!  I usually get the Whitey Ford special, and/or Popeye Style and have never been disappointed EXCEPT for this one time when I decided to be adventurous and request extra garlic on the Popeye style pizza. Bad choice. It arrived soggy and depressing. So don't get crazy with your extra toppings is my advice. If you do, don't say I didn't tell you so. But also, it is salvageable by baking in the oven/toaster oven for another 11 min at 375 and if you're a mushroom person you might as well add hella slices on top. So in the end, I was happy. 4 stars, will probably order again."}
{"text":"I ordered today from Lefty's Pizza . My order was chicken wings and fries. They were the WORST chicken wings I've ever eaten I'm ny life.  They were dry and tasted old . So u called Grubhub that's who delivered my food and told them I wanted my money back. They called the restaurant and told them no that I can order wings again . Why would I order them again if they were so discusting?  I threw them out I couldn't even eat them. THIS RESTAURANT STINKS. DON'T EVER ORDER FROM THEM"}
{"text":"I can't begin to Express how wonderful they are. Food is really good. I recomend the specialty pizza over the discounted super large ones. There seems to be a huge difference in quality. They actually have a good sandwich,  their pastas are good and not expensive. All around one of my favorite places in the area. They once made a mistake and the next time they actually did take care of me. I eat at many places, but we gravitate towards this place more often than any other."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this pizza delivery place. The pizza was delivered within 10 mins of my specified time. It arrived nice and piping hot. The crust was delicious and the toppings were very very plentiful. It was some excellent pizza. And for a pretty good price too and under $11 and just $2 for delivery. Good deal and good eats. I'll definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Classic good and greasy pizza...mmmm, mmmm, mmmmm, so good!  Reminds me of my late night college pizza joint."}
{"text":"Lefty's left us very satisfied. My boyfriend and I ordered the Scilian sized Babe Ruth Home-Run pizza. It was delicious, and more food than we could imagine eating. We also requested a joke be written on the box, and it was hilarious. Overall a must try."}
{"text":"I got to say! I found the best pizza joint nestled right in the middle of town. Best part of it was that I just didn't go up to any registers to place my order. No I sat at the counter like if I was at home and ordered my pizza. I decided on the Popeyes but we all know people it's all about the dough!! And yes my pizza was amazing with tons of fresh garlic,mozzarella,ricotta,oregano and of course fresh spinach with sauce. Can't wait to go back! Prices are great staff is very personable. Thank you Jon and Ryan for my awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"I've ordered here a few times and it was pretty good. This last time, the delivery driver must have got lost, pizza was cold when it finally reached my house an hour and  a half later, and I only live 10 minutes away."}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant to try this place but i'm so glad we tried it. We placed an order for pick up so I cannot speak to the establishment.   I can say that they were fast with our order, convenient in location and did I mention the pizza was DELICIOUS!   Garlic knots were awesome and pizza was HUGE! We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We have lived here 6 years. Been looking for an amazing local pizza place and we have officially found it. At first I thought omg it's in a gas station what am I getting myself into but now that I've had a pizza a sub and few different appetizers I'm hooked. Seriously omg delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding in flavor ! The chicken fingers were very good ! They drizzle franks sauce on top of them making them most but still crispy ! The wings were perfectly cooked and crispy but the chicken was still juicy :) and last but not least the pizza was incredible! The sauce,cheese and dough tasted homemade  and  was cooked perfect and wasn't  greasy :) if you want  amazing food at a good price this is the place !"}
{"text":"I am extremely picky when it comes to pizza! I tried another \"NY style\" place in Vegas and it was good but WAY overpriced. Not only does Lefty's have some incredible Pizza they have Stromboli's, calzones, pastas, buckets of wings, and the list goes on. I am very impressed with the quality of everything I've had so far and it's def the closest to \"NY pizza\" I've had since leaving NYC! Oh and the price is even better!"}
{"text":"Many of the reviews for Lefty's say it's the best pizza in Vegas, or at least in the top five.  If that's the case, I may have to move back east.  I understand that being on the west coast, it's going to be hard to find east coast pizza.  I lowered my expectations, and I picked Lefty's based on the reviews on Yelp.  What a mistake that was.  I'm going to start off with my review of the food.  The rest of the experience was not great either, but some of that was simple mis-communication and has no bearing on the actual food.  To start, we ordered two pizzas.  We got a plain pie and a mushroom/sausage pie.  We ordered mediums, thinking that we should have more than enough food for two of us.  The menu says that the medium pizza is 14\".  Our pizzas were not 14\".  They arrived in comically small boxes that I have seen for personal pies or for single slice take out.  I remined hopeful, however, that the pizza within was big on taste.  The pizza within was not big on anything.  It was flat with a very stiff and bland crust.  Good pizza crust has a bite and then a spongy texture on the inside.  This was more like the texture of a garlic knot.  It was heavy and doughy.  The cheese was greasy.  The sauce was ok, but nothing to save the rest of the pizza debacle.  All told this was not the pizza i expected based on the Yelp reviews.  I dont know where some of you got your pizza from on the east coast, but if this is what it was like, you are getting lied to.  My Las Vegas pizza search will continue elsewhere.  Now, on to the other factors that contributed to my 2-star score.  My house is about 2 miles from Lefty's.  At the time of night we ordered, this pizza should have been at my door in 30 minutes or less.  After 90 minutes we had to call and find out where our pizza was.  Turns out that the driver couldn't find the street (new neighborhood that isn't in their map yet).  To make matters worse, the person who took our order never took our phone number so they were unable to call us and ask for directions.  To top it all off, there is a delivery charge.  We ended up paying $2 to have a driver come 2 miles and deliver us luke-warm pizza about an hour later than we expected it.  I know that gas is expensive, but if I am paying for you to deliver me food, you better get it right and get it to me fast.  To Lefty's credit, they did recognize that this was their fault and they offered me two free pizzas.  If their system for keeping track of store credit is as good as their system of taking down delivery addresses, I dont expect to see those free pizzas anytime soon.  Of course, based on the pizzas I got last night, I may not want to..."}
{"text":"Saltiest pizza I've ever had. Couldn't even eat the it, which is impressive considering how starving I was after waiting 90 minutes for delivery. Totally disappointing after reading the positive reviews."}
{"text":"We live about 1/2 of a mile from this restaurant. Last night we ordered a bucket of wings and French fries. We told the guy who took our order what the cross streets are and he stated he knew exactly where we live. We were quoted 40 minutes for delivery.  After an hour and thirty minutes passed we called to find out where our delivery was? The guy said the driver was lost. They remade the food and would deliver it in 20 minutes. Another 40 minutes passed and we were about to call again when the guy showed up with our food.  Today I brought the salad for lunch. I was almost done eating it when I found the tip of a rubber glove in the container.   WE WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. We always order the veggie pizza and it would come so soggy. We would call to complain and they said that's how it comes because the veggies are wet....what?? It was like eating pizza that was dipped in water"}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews but when I do...  This was by far the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. If you're in the area looking for pizza, pass on this establishment. The staff was unfriendly. The seating area is, well..., a storage area for their pizza boxes and the place looked like it hadn't been cleaned since 1995. I'd rather eat my dogs food than this pizza."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The taste was good but I got a cold pizza. I'm sure if I ate there it would be good. The garlic knots were sick. The flavor and texture was off. Kinda raw. The delivery girl was sweet and really sold her product, good job. Next time I won't have it delivered maybe I'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"I was really hoping we'd found another great pizza place nearby.  Unfortunately this is not the place.   We ordered the Romano pizza, it's described \"With fresh garlic, grated romano cheese and oregano\"  Sounds great right?  Well what we received is a cold pizza with a \"cheese\" crust.  The cheese was the parmesan that comes in a shaker off the shelf.  It was inedible.  We ordered meatball topping.  The meatball had zero taste.  I'm not sure what the meatballs were.  The sauce has zero flavor.  It was very dry, we tried putting olive oil on it, didn't help.  Usually I can stomach any pizza, but we wasted our money on that one, we both ate half a slice, threw the rest away.   We also ordered the pizza fries.  Again, the sauce must be the cheapest they can get, it has no flavor, ketchup would be better.  Again inedible.   We tried the zeppolis, and thank god I ordered 12 because that was our dinner.  Luckily they couldn't mess up fried dough with sugar. As you can see from my other reviews I tell it like it is.  Trust me when I say, order from anywhere else.  Papa Johns, Dominos, even bake a DiGiornos."}
{"text":"Ehhh... if you LOVE  garlic it's ok. It's to much for me. Everything I ordered tasted like garlic oil. Won't be back. Wish I loved this place, cuz it's so close to home. I miss Frankie's (Eastern&wigwam)!!! Wish they delivered to my new home cuz I would have been satisfied with my dinner tonight. ."}
{"text":"Supreme pizza was atomic bomb! Mozzarella sticks and fried mushrooms are the best I've ever had! If you spend $25 you get a free large salad or spaghetti too. Will without a doubt be coming here again."}
{"text":"Ordered on New Years Day, Pizza was freakin delicious and Alfredo fries were just fire! Highly Recommend to anyone!  The guys working were super friendly and funny!"}
{"text":"Love coming here to late night snack! They have a 2 slice and soda special for a $3.95, cant really beat that! Their chicken fingers and fries are good! Plus its nearby home, so dont have to drive too far! Good part is they open till 10 on weekdays and 12am on weekends."}
{"text":"I used to order almost weekly. I like their pizza but their ravioli is always overcooked. I like it Al dente. Their lasagne is ok. I always have to ask them not to overcook the bread knots because mine were burnt several times.  They were late with my order at least three times even though I live 5 min away. This was after the lunch hour and before dinner hour, not what I would consider to be a busy time. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My go to pizza place. Maybe because it's close to my house and they have great fingers and fries. But the pizza is very good"}
{"text":"Good crust. Cant argue with the price. Needs some development on their sauce. Overall worth it."}
{"text":"It's hard to impress me with pizza because I'm from the east coast but this place did! We ordered online via EAT24. The delivery arrived in 30 minutes.   We ordered the Babe Ruth Home Run pie, a plain cheese (which was anything but plain--yum!) and an order of buffalo wings.   We ordered both as \"Thin Crusts\", which is just normal crust pizza to anyone from New York. They came out perfect! Crisp bottom and hot toppings. The cheese didn't slide off like some places do. All of the toppings were very fresh.   Their cheese was what impressed me. It tasted like whole milk FRESH mozzarella! I'm not sure if it was but I loved it.   We will be ordering again soon! It's so nice to know we have a great delivery place do close to home!"}
{"text":"So I ordered from eat24.com and waited for lefty's to deliver my food. About and hour and a half later I finally get connected with someone at lefty's telling me that they had put my receipt order down somewhere and forgot about it. Then telling me they had issues with the website after the employee told me what they had just done. About 2 hours and some odd mins I finally get my food. Then they tell me that I have a credit for the amount I ordered and just to call them next time for the order. Then I call them a month later telling them that I have credit for the messed up order and lefty's tells me that I have already used the credit when I never did. These people just don't want to lose money apparently."}
{"text":"Been going here for 5 years & love how tasty everything is. Hot wings , pizza or philly is aways my hardest choice ! Very nice workers , always puts a smile on my face. The free salad/spaghetti for an order over $25 always gets me !"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. It is a whole in the wall so don't be surprised. I get the Popeyes pizza and it is a hit every time. I wouldn't get the garlic knots, there just not great and the chicken is good but not great. But the pizza makes it a five star. I actually think I an going to get some right now!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food and am rather picky when it comes to it. This place is delicious to say the least! Definitely a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Everything is super good! Love this joint! Definitely a knock out of the park and must try if in the area."}
{"text":"Sicilian Popeye Pizza wasn't satisfying. Crust was hard and tasted plain. Should've just got $5 Hot and Ready from Little Caesars. Onion rings was oily and soft. Breaded mushrooms was alright. Ordered pick up, Yelp estimated it'll take 40-45 mins. Got there but ended up waiting another 30mins. First and last time experience."}
{"text":"I think their customer service could be a lot better but they make a really great pizza. They also have a good price. If you live near them the carry out large pizza deal is good."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium pizza and 8 wings to be delivered. The delivery guy could not find my apartment and I just ended up meeting him at the front. When I got the pizza, it was cold, but it tasted fine. The wings are by far the worst wings I have ever ordered in my life. The chicken is so hard I couldn't bite into it and there is little to no sauce on them. They are literally too hard to be eaten."}
{"text":"I've had Lefty's Pizza twice and both times it tasted delicious. I had the cheese pizza the first time and a pepperoni and jalapeño the second time. The first time I had Lefty's was delivery and the timing was pretty accurate even though the delivery guy got a little lost. I gave the delivery man money and he didn't ask if I wanted change, I didn't want any but it kinda threw me off that he just walked away without asking. The next time I ordered it for pick up. Everybody seemed pretty nice and welcoming. They had my pizza ready in the box and still warm in the oven. Overall it was a good experience both times and would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Pepperoni & mushroom pizza and those little powdered donut things are DELICIOUS. I've also had their cheese raviolis which were good. Maybe it just depends what you order because I see a lot of 1 star reviews, but this place gets a solid 5 from me especially because their customer service has always been friendly and on point."}
{"text":"So far I've only had the chicken wings, but they are very good. I tried them one night for a test run to make sure they were good. And they definitely passed the test so I came back for a large order for fight night. Everyone loved them. Blue cheese is also good. Great consistency and flavor.   Staff is friendly and helpful. I ordered and paid online and my food was ready when I arrived. They also offer delivery which is nice.   Wings are cooked perfect, crispy but not dry. I ordered hot and they have a good spice but not too hot. Definitely my new favorite for takeout wings!  One of these days I'll have to try the pizza or other menu items."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas , I will always order my pizza from here. Just wish they were closer to central Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place, Very friendly staff, we order the meat loves at least once maybe twice a month. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My family loves the pizza and wings!  We have been going here for years and will definitely continue."}
{"text":"I love this pizza spot.  I love the fact I can get a couple of slices, and a soda, for $6.00 .  The lady there is always sweet, I will have to get her name next time I go.  It only takes about 5 min. for them to fix your pizza, and your on your way!."}
{"text":"our pizzas were very good, but the chicken wings and fingers were extremely low end."}
{"text":"Been getting pizza here for years.  They are the best in town.  The only other place that is as good is Rocco's in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Lefty's is right down the street from me, but I didn't try it for a long, long time. Every time I went to the gas station/quickie mart next door, I would smell the aromas, and finally, it occurred to me to try it. And then try it again!  Love it! The pizza is better than most I've tried in Vegas. The chicken wings and strips were both great. The guys working there seem like pros. They have a big menu too, so I may have to try some other stuff next time.  I'm usually on Atkins, so I don't eat this kind of food much. But I'll definitely keep Lefty's in mind for my next \"cheat day.\" Don't let the smallness of the joint fool you, they've got great stuff."}
{"text":"This Pizza place is Bomblicious! I love there pizza very flavorful and great size for the price.  delivery is kinda long but its worth it ."}
{"text":"This place is hella good... Quick and fast delivery too... Their Sicilian pizza is their best item."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I would not even give them one star! We returned after many years because it was on my way home from shopping. My husband googled their menu and number. We did not get the amount of food that was on google so my husband called. The menu stated 40 wings in a bucket and 5 fingers in an order. We got 20 wings and 3 fingers. My husband called to ask. I did not get an itemized receipt to compare the menu prices and what I was charged. There is a menu on google and a menu on yelp and more. All prices are different. There was 2 gentlemen working when we picked up the food. Tall dark hair guy and the guy making pizzas. The tall dark hair guy told my husband that if the internet states I'm giving 10 pizzas for free do u think I would give out free pizzas. He also hung up on my husband. My husband called back and the dark hair guy told him he should have ordered from Dominos. Instead of explaining nicely that there are different menus, he was rude and hung up on my husband again. The food was not good at all. The fries were burnt and chicken wings tasted like it was fried in old oil. Our bill was over $50 and it was not worth the amount of food and it tasted horrible.   We are easy going people and don't like to complain but this time we needed to."}
{"text":"It was extremely easy to order through Yelp and the price was great! Took the usual time about 40 minutes and the delivery guy was extremely nice. Oh and the food was just as good too, could of been alittle bit more hot but all in all great experience."}
{"text":"terrible customer service the lady on the phone treated me like an idiot. i felt unwanted please don't eat here. i want a refund and free food"}
{"text":"Great pizza! On time and close by. Definitely will be ordering from there again. Got the veggie pizza with pepperoni. Veggies were fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Love the wings and pizza. The place is located inside a gas station so it's not the most appealing place, How ever food is good and the people there are very nice"}
{"text":"Nice pizza. Good crust tasty cheese and ready on time. Family and I enjoyed the pie quite nicely."}
{"text":"Decided that we wanted pizza and delivered so I found this restaurant that fulfilled both of those features. The delivery process was smooth, but I ordered two large pizzas from them and was only received one. Before the delivery driver left contacted him about the missing pizza and confirmed that his order receipt was only one too.   The missing part pizza was sitting on the bottom of the paper that did not come through it was in limbo. The pizza was redelivered to me and all was great again. Their food was excellent and I ordered so much that could not even finish all. Overall would of been excellent service without the pizza going to limbo"}
{"text":"VERY VERY GOOD pizza! The Babe Ruth Home-Run Specialty Pizza is what I recommend!"}
{"text":"I though the pizza was ok I order a XXL pizza for a get together. The only thing that went wrong with this pizza is buy the time I got it home it was hot and soggy like they didn't let the crust cook enough at all. I will have just have to tell them next time to leave it in the a little longer."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. I've never ordered from Lefty's before. It took about 45 minutes, but it was worth the wait. The pizzas are good sized and they use a great cheese blend. I like extra cheese and Lefty's delivered it! The cheese was thick! The sauce is tasty but not overpowering. It has a fresh clean taste. The sausage was seasoned nicely too. The pizzas were perfectly browned. I would gladly order from them again."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to place for pizza and Philly cheesesteak sandwiches. The delivery people have all been good, even when we order at the last minute. The pizza crust is very strong, so I recommend getting a lot of toppings. We like the Babe Ruth and recently got the Popeye with added sausage. I wish the Eat 24 app gave the option for extra cheese though. I like extra cheese on my pizza, but I prefer to order online rather than call on the phone."}
{"text":"I was having a gastrointestinal issue and felt like I needed something greasy to get the pipes pushin'  like a water slide so I ordered up a mushroom and pepperoni pizza. I would describe it as thebomb.com, but when I just searched that domain just now it rerouted to some gossip website called 'The Chive' and I don't think that accurately reflects how to describe pizza at all.    I give these guys a 5 star rating because the staff is as cool as toilet water, plus I used to pick up medicinal pot in their parking lot!  They might be named Lefty's, but gall-darn it if they don't treat you right!"}
{"text":"I've never actually been to lefty's or have picked up/received delivery from there so my review is strictly based on product quality. I've been living in this area for two years and I am sad I didn't discover this place sooner. I've tried ever pizza place in this are and lefty's blows them all out of the water. The crust is the perfect density as is the ratio of sauce to cheese/toppings. We had cheese with pepperoni and jalapeño which might be my new flavor combo. Plain cheese is great as well."}
{"text":"I was let down by the previous yelp reviews.  My first clue to go elsewhere should have been when I asked for a sicilian pizza and was told that they \"were out of that size crust.\" Really? You can't just make a crust?  I ordered 2 other pizzas of different sizes and picked them up for carryout. The guys at the counter were polite and courteous.   The pizza itself was okay. Better than the major chains (which isn't hard), but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"First time I've tried this place and unfortunately I'm not a fan of their pizza.  The wings were awesome but the pizza, sorry.  First off my order was late, when I called to check on the order, they couldn't even find my ticket and he had to ask everyone else if my order went out yet.....the pizza was soggy, not like your typical NY pizza which is greasy, this was soggy and the taste was not good at all....I've had much better pizza in town.    I even tried the pizza again a second time as left overs are always good and still nope not good at all.  The crust has no taste to it, the pizza itself did not even taste like regular pizza...I don't know if it's the sauce or the meat they use, I'm just not sure but almost all of a XXL pizza went to the trash.   I even had friends over and they did not like they way the pizza tasted, so it was just not my opinion.  I asked if they wanted to take some home and they said nope, just throw it away....that was a waste of $35...  The good news is I guess, is it's a lesson learned and I will not order from this place again.  It's sad as I was so hopeful for a good meal and this was not it."}
{"text":"I'm from New York but spend time out in Las Vegas during the winter months .  Having a craving for a good slice of Pizza ( like we're known for back home ) , I checked yelp to guide me .  I chose Lefty's and was happy I did .  I really enjoyed the meat lovers pizza !! The pie was cooked perfectly  . All the meat was fresh and tasty .. And the crust was vey good as well .  Lastly , the price was very , very reasonable .  Back home , a pie of this quality is almost twice the price !!  The staff was courteous and helpful ... Thank u so much for satisfying my craving .  See u again :-)"}
{"text":"Staff was very slow. We decided to dine in. Waitress took our order and it proceeded to take 45 minutes for wings, two slices of pizza & garlic knots. The staff seemed super unorganized. The food is alright definitely not worth the service/ price."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed. Most of the reviews said that it was really good and I was pretty excited to eat there. However they did make my pizza and garlic knots in a timely manner. The pizza was okay, it wasn't anything special. And my garlic knots were burnt. Literally hard as a rock. I'm not one to call the store and complain I usually just deal with it, but I guess that's my fault. And it was a little annoying that the girl working there was outside in her friends car for a while. I didn't realize that she had worked there until I was waiting for 5 minutes for someone to come to the front desk and she comes from out side all disorientated. When I gave her my name she was like \"what um.... What did you get again? Are you sure?\" So that was a little unsettling. But I'll try it again maybe they just had an off day."}
{"text":"This place is great! The hot wings are awesome and the pizza is pretty good aswell. Don;t pass up on the sandwiches. My favorite is the Phili cheese steak.   It's a very small place but don't let that scare you away!"}
{"text":"I'd personally give this place 2.5 stars. Ordered delivery last night and it took an hour to arrive. We ordered a medium pizza, fries, and mozzarella sticks. I will say the food was hot when it arrived. The first bite of pizza was good, but every bite after I was disappointed. Fries are fries you know, but the mozzarella sticks were something you could get out of the frozen food section, not worth $5.99. Also they forget extra sauces I had paid for. Not impressed, probably will not order again."}
{"text":"We had it last night,  the prices are good,  the food is meh. Husband liked the meat lovers, with its big hunks of meat, i got the white pizza it was good but the middle of it  was not done. My daughter loved the chicken fingers. The garlic knots were whatever. One thing i CAN say is there ranch is delish!! I dipped everything in it, thank goodness for that ranch it was the only way i could get the pizza down. I enjoyed the convience of on line ordering, although it took an hour to be delivered, we live less than a mile away. Ugh i guess we will keep looking for our new pizza place."}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza and the worst customer service I have had in a long time.  I picked up my pizza, and put it on the front seat, flat.  When I got home it looked like someone had tipped it sideways and all of the toppings and the cheese were slid over to one side of the pizza and the other side had not sauce or toppings it was just pizza crust.  I called to let them know and the guy said \"well obviously it is your fault because you must have put it in the car wrong\"  What???  I told him it was flat and he started cursing at me and telling me he has been making pizza for 17 years and I must have dropped it or something.  No apology, nothing!  I always try to support local businesses rather than big chains but this is one place I will never go again."}
{"text":"awesome pizza! awesome service!! very consistent!! my friday go to joint!!! best pizza in vegas"}
{"text":"Okay, place has pizza in its name, maybe if you want fingers or ribs or whatever go to a place that has those clues in their name.  Save yourself from experimenting, and order the signature dish.  It is called Lefty's because Babe Ruth was a lefty.  Order the Baby Ruth pizza, medium for two who like a slice at dawn, large if others are hungry too.  Call it in, come 20 minutes later, and you will love this pizza.  They make their own sauce, dough, the toppings are generous and as fresh as you are going to find in Vegas.  We order it at least once a month, it has never wavered or changed, it is always done perfectly.  Lots of green pepper strips, onions, sausage that is WOW, pepperoni, generous cheese, what else you want?  Old school oven, no hairdryer pizza at Lefty's.   Crust is firm enough to support the amount of toppings, but thin enough that you don't feel the need to go on a diet after.  I can't offer an opinion on the rest of the menu, I want ribs, I go to a rib joint, wings, wing joint.  This place is a pizza joint.  Capiche?"}
{"text":"Best pizza on our side of town. I've been ordering there for years. After a long week, it's the perfect place to have delivered great taste right at your front door."}
{"text":"Garlic bread and pizza were awesome! Great flavor, fresh, and delivered piping hot! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"We waited an hour and 45 minutes and they didn't bring our full order. Also, half the toppings had slid off the pizza. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Ordered a Babe Ruth Pizza through the Eat24 App (which worked like a charm), however, when the Pizza arrived it was barely edible due to the crust -- which was like a wooden plank. To be more specific, the first third (from the outside in) was hard as a rock. The next third was about right and the center was doughy (not fully cooked). I've never experienced anything like this before. To be honest, the toppings were tasty enough but all-in-all a very disappointing meal and mostly a waste of money."}
{"text":"I just recently bought a home in the Silverado Ranch area. Growing up in the same area, I always had Leftys after school. I remember their huge cheese pizza slices! I feeling nostalgic and decided to have my first delivery to my new home be Leftys. I ordered online through the website. An hour and a half later the pizza arrived. I called about an hour after waiting and they said it was out for delivery and they were limited on drivers. Once the pizza got here I was happy! We ordered onion rings, wings and pizza. We were hangry, okay?! Definitely eating here again but next time we will just go pick it up."}
{"text":"Ordered two Pizzas was told $28.99 on the phone $40.00 when delivered - shocked at the price but could be not a good deal either way if one Pizza wasn't under cooked the other wasn't burnt - bad deal at any price.   Cardboard crust coupled with cold cheese on one and burnt cheese on the BBQ Chicken Pizza - like eating frozen at 3x the price - by the way the last Cheese Pizza I picked up was well above average this time around they more than sucked.   Order at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. It's a weird location and I was not thrilled with the ambiance or lack there of. Basically it's affordable and they made a good pepperoni pie. I got take out to eat it at home. The staff was nice.  So yes, I'll eat there again."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 thumbs up! Just moved to this area and was hoping to find a new local pizza place to eat at since the one I ate at for 4 years is too far away now lol. Soooo yeah, I like them, hubby approves too.  :)  Its pizza you guys... not a 5 star restaurant. Calm down."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place, the toppings are normal quality; but the dough needs to be better, not a lot of flavor in it and it needs to be more toasted."}
{"text":"I have not been here for awhile, but loved everything we ordered, Chicago Hot Dog, Beef and Sausage sandwich and pizza pizza. This is the best thing to Chicago style food in San Diego just delicious"}
{"text":"Flavor is good. I do like the seasonings.   However, my pizza was severely undercooked.  I waited 20 minutes for the Pizza, and when I got it, it was doughy, soft, and falling apart. I had to put it in my own oven when I got it home, just to give it some crisp.   Also, it was really over-priced.  $14 for a large extra-cheese pizza is pricy..   Not at all worth the price."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great price, fast service! Zero complaints!! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered a calzone and half rack of ribs...the calzone had NO flavor No seasoning of any kind, completely bland.  Literally a few bites in (I say few because he wanted to make sure) it went in to the trash:-(  My ribs were so dry it was as if they where sitting under a heat lamp ALL day....no amount of Bbq sauce could hide the dryness.  The onion rings were good.   After they took are delivery order they called back 20mins later asking for are debit card number again....they had in put it incorrectly:-/  We won't be eating from here again.  That was like throwing are money directly into the trash."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! It happened to be the closest thing to New York pizza! We will continue to come here as long as they keep making amazing pizza. Don't forget it's inside the gas station."}
{"text":"Best pizza in south Las Vegas. Their homemade ranch is probably the best I've ever had. I told them they need bottle it and sell it to locals."}
{"text":"Pretty solid go to neighborhood pizza joint.  I been going here for years, some ingredients has changed over the years but still good.   My favorites here are the Whitey Ford and Pepperoni Pizza with extra cheese.  The ranch is really good here too, I think they add garlic to it.  The chicken fingers are huge and sloppy (drenched in sauce) but they are delicious too.    If you're tired of the chain pizza joints and want to try a good mom and pops spot, go with Lefty's.  They been around so many years for a reason."}
{"text":"My wife & I order the philly cheese steak sandwich tonight. A Gah- Damnnnn! That was a tasty cheesesteak! I strongly recommend this sandwich."}
{"text":"Had a piece of a pizza from here with vegan cheese on it... So freaking good! One of those things you could eat every night! Hope it goes on the menu full time. If so, I live down the street and hate to cook so I'll be ordering lots! :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Babe Ruth pizza and it was pretty delicious! Next time I'll order easy topping!"}
{"text":"Terrible service , very rude . Order is always wrong. A dirty establishment. The employees bicker and ignore customers. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"I've received quite a few menus on my door for this place before. I'm never ordered from them before but tonight I was craving pizza. I ordered through the Eat24 app and the food was at my door within 40 minutes.    I ordered the one topping pizza, pepperoni, and a basket of fries. The fries are thicker cut, which I prefer, and the pizza hit the spot. I was almost tempted on trying a stromboli or calzone, but I guess that will have to be for next time."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Don't ever order delivery it's been 1.5 hours & we live 30 minutes from Lefty! They Suck!!! They are less than 1 star but There isn't a zero star! So the food finally got here & the wings were cold the pizza crust was burnt THEY SUCK!"}
{"text":"It's our first time ordering Leftys Pizza, and they didn't disappoint. I'm glad we took the chance that they would deliver to us because we're slightly out of the way. Awesome pizza, salad, and Italian combo sandwich. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ordered Lefty's pizza yesterday for dinner and I have to say it was truly amazing! Got the Whitey ford pizza, instead of tomato sauce asked for Alfredo sauce as I'm a lover of white pizza which some restaurants call it. The richness of the sauce with the cheese and ricotta was amazing. I added pepperonis to it as well and it was mind blowing! I did order zeppolis for dessert, they were good...except most of them were not fully fried, I couldn't eat them, the dough was still raw...which saddened me. But it wasn't bad, probably will stick to just the pizza and order something else instead of dessert."}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years and getting delivery. I love the pizza and they Also have good subs and the spaghetti is pretty standard.  The pizza is amazing and the subs always a great price."}
{"text":"So I just ordered pizza, cheese sticks, and a philly sandwich.....I say this with a heavy heart....Literally, the philly was godly! I'm upset because I didn't get a chance to eat the pizza because the philly was straight epic! Serious. I ordered it plain. Just cheese and meat and I can die a happy man!  I will hopefully wake tomorrow from my cheese coma to tell you how the pizza was but for now I don't care.....The philly was life changing. The delivery guy was great and we had a moment,  and I feel like we're all buddies. This is as real as it gets......Order that damn sandwitch. P. S. Don't tell my wife. I feel bad."}
{"text":"Great pizza with customer service that goes far and beyond the call of duty!!! Check out the pizza my wife ordered for me on Valentine's Day!!! Delicious as always. My family loves the ranch from here. We order the cup size ( my family is a crazy loving ranch sauce kind of family). My wife likes the salad (of course because of the ranch!!!). They just st moved next door and they started serving breakfast. It's the same employee that we have know for years. Chicken fingers are amazing too!!! When my family from other parts of town come over they ALL AWAY suggest Leftys."}
{"text":"I can't in good faith rate a 1 star despite hating the food, because I did wind up eating some of it.  But what I don't understand is all the 5 Star reviews.  This pizza is far from great.  Dry and cold, the cheese reminded me of day-old nachos and the sauce was totally nonexistent.  I agree with others who say it is hard to find a quality pie here in Vegas, but two places that come close for me are New York Pizza and Pasta (Sahara/Jones) and Metro Pizza (Decatur/Flamingo)...Metro can be hit or miss, try the Old New York.    Anyway, I had just gotten notice that Lefty's started delivering to me and was excited to try the new place with all the great reviews.  Suffice to say, I will not be wasting my money with this place again."}
