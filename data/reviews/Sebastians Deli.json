{"text":"They have  biggest selection of smokies and beef jerky. The teriyaki smokies are delicious and my favorite."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh meat for an event or a delicious dinner- look no further. Sebastian's Deli is my go-to for fresh anything- pork, beef, suckling pig, barbecue, European sausage, steak and veal. The good news is: it's grown here right in Ohio! So if your a lover of local Cleveland foods- head down to the West Side Market where they cut everything fresh right in front of you.   The most memorable thing I remember about this place is how kind and accommodating the staff was even in the crazy busy environment. I was heading on a long drive to Florida and I bought a bunch of smoked sausage and jerky and it just made the long 20 hour drive that much better (and yummier)."}
