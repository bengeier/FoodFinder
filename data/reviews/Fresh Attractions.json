{"text":"The food is mediocre at best and my credit card number was stolen last week after making a purchase there. Stay away unless you have cash. Otherwise, it's okay for a quick bite if you don't have time for an alternative food option."}
{"text":"The sandwich I had made was AMAZING!  The ingredients were fresh and the bread was well made.  Definitely a delightful surprise when grabbing a meal between gates!

Note:  The price of the pre-made sandwiches (in the cooler) and the handmade sandwiches are the same... however, the handmade ones look phenomenal.... absolutely worth the extra couple of minutes to have them prepared and topped especially for you :)"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Gas station/rest-stop area sandwiches..but I walked past this sandwich and was very surprise by how beautiful and fresh it looked and I had to try it

simply outstanding..."}
{"text":"Really poor customer service. Worst customer service, in fact. Had a layover and passed this on my way to my gate. I grabbed a premade salad, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service! I got a tuna salad sandwich - it had capers in it, which was a nice touch. :) Also, the ingredients were fresh and yummy! Good for simple food while traveling!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the breakfast panini I got. It had plenty of bacon, eggs and cheese. Nothing to complain about. And the sourdough was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest I did not get a chance to even eat here. However, the service is severely lacking in my opinion. I walked up and reviewed the menu board and asked for the chicken salad on a bed of lettuce. \"What bread?\" I'm asked. I repeat that I'd like the chicken salad on a bed of lettuce with tomatoes and black olives. The reply, \"we can't do that, the lettuce is small you need the bread\". Not quite sure that I understood, I asked \"You're saying I can't get chicken salad without the bread?\" The reply, \"you need the bread.\"

Now I like bread as much as the next guy but sometimes I just do not want to be filled up by bread. I've always assumed that chicken salad could be eaten by itself and enjoyed in that manner. In fact, I've eaten it this way for many years. Apparently that was incomprehensible to the staff here. I won't bother returning in the future."}
{"text":"It's as if they used an oatmeal base to form a selection of Deli item imposters to create one of the blandest sandwiches that I have ever eaten. 
Heed the warnings and go to Phillips or Sbarro."}
{"text":"Before you eat here, know that there's a Starbucks just up the way, and a Sbarro just across from it. Both are better options, kids. 

I was attracted to the idea of freshness, but that's not at all what I got. My turkey and pesto panini was salty, and although they had grilled it it was still cold. Very unappealing and gross. For an $8 sandwich, I expected a lot more. 

There are very few food options in this terminal, but believe me when I say you're better off eating at any other than Fresh Attractions."}
{"text":"Got a veggie sandwich on sour dough at the fresh attractions in front of gate C8. That bread was either frozen for a long time or was at least 3 days old. The cucumbers had been frozen. Dang. All that for $12.00 including a small water. Rip off."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Chicken sand which was absolutely amazing! 

It is kind of sad that they only have 10 reviews at an airport. I recommend this to new comers to try it out"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the bad reviews. It's a sandwich shop, and it's fast. 

The sandwich I had was turkey double meat and toasted. Always on the go, I unfortunately find myself at Subway way more than I have to. This place runs circles around it as far as freshness & taste. I'd eat here again. 

The crew was foreign and have a semi-difficult time understanding you. But, no issues."}
{"text":"How could I have forgotten my forgettable experience at Fresh Attractions the last time I was stressing through CLT? And thus, confirmation: the food here sucks.

Sure, the Jalape単o Chicken panino sounds appealing. One bite in, and I called shenanigans on the \"grilled\" poultry (brown lines looked drawn on), nearly raw bacon fat with the titillating essence of fake jalape単o spice, and a puddle of gross honey mustard on bread pressed in a lukewarm griddle. Great, now it just feels stale. How much does instant regret cost? $9.50? Sounds about right.

Did I mention the lettuce felt like paper in my mouth? I'm sorry; that sounds insensitive - I actually know a few people who eat paper, and they're fine folks. They'd never touch this sandwich.

Never again."}
{"text":"$12.86 for a crappy roast beef sandwich with a bottle of water. Complete rip off. Sandwich was horrible. If you're passing through CLT avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Overpriced and slow. The two ladies didn't speak very good English and I'm guessing is what led to me getting the incorrect order. I may have possibly gotten someone else's order. Not a good system for keeping orders straight. I was on the plane before I found out that it was not what I ordered. I called when I landed and was told I would get a call back within 48 hours. That did not happen. Food was fresh and made to order or they have prepackaged food. I would not recommend due to incorrect or and no recourse or customer service and price."}
{"text":"Saddest breakfast sandwich of my life, got the egg and cheese panini,  didn't have all the ingredients on it listed on the menu greasy didn't taste like anything"}
{"text":"Overpriced Water, nothing new at an airport. 
Caesar salad, not bad - mostly fresh lettuce. Soggy croutons. Airport to-go food."}
{"text":"Basic airport food but on the slightly healthier side. Staff was friendly but the food was average.

The hours on yelp say they are closed on Saturday's but I just ate here.."}
{"text":"2 Stars., Mostly based on the Service.  Tried to order a sandwich and definitely seemed like I was inconveniencing the young lady and gentleman working there.  They asked me what type of bread and that was it.    MAYBE MAYBE they were accurate when they told me each additional topping (i.e. Lettuce, Tomato, Onion etc.) was 0.85 cents extra (would have added up quickly), but I'm pretty sure she was just lazy and didn't want to do any additional work.    Sandwhich was just \"OK\".  Each Sandwich is roughly $10.

Doubt the owners will read this review and care, but your staff is costing you business.   1 and done for me.

Thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"What terrible customer service. The person making my sandwich kept talking about how she's been working too hard and not paying attention to customers. Surprise...my order was wrong. But I didn't want to go back for fear she would spit in my sandwich...which incidentally was not very good and the wrong order. AVOID THIS PLACE! Bad service with bad food!"}
{"text":"WORST experience ever The service is Bad, they didn't give me what I asked for, I just wanted a \"Jalape単o Grilled chicken papini\" with whole wheat bread,which is in the menu, not like I inveted, when I was paying the girl asked me for the second time what kind of bread I wanted and I said \"Whole wheat please\" so I waited over 10 min, whith a sandwich in regular bread, without jalape単os, and when I told them about the mistake, the didnt care, so this place must be Closed, they dont jave any respect for their costumers and the food is awful."}
{"text":"As far as airport cuisine, Fresh Attractions seemed reasonably priced, reasonably healthy, and it was also directly located across from my gate, making it the most convenient option for food. The line was short which also sweetened the deal. In addition to pre-packaged salads, sandwiches, and protein snack packs, there is also the option for freshly made paninis and sandwiches. I chose a pre-configured option, the Jalapeno chicken sandwich on sourdough. Ingredients included jalapeno bacon, pulled chicken, honey mustard, and provolone cheese. I received my sandwich within about 5 minutes of ordering. When I opened the carefully wrapped package, the first thing that stuck out to me was the size-actually very nicely sized for the $9.50 price. I was fully satisfied after finishing the panini. Since it was fresh-pressed, the cheese was gooey and well-melted, spread generously throughout. There was definitely an evident kick to this panini and I was grateful for the honey mustard to even it out. Chicken was cooked and plentiful, and the bacon was also well-done and portioned appropriately. Chips and cookies are also available for purchase but if you are still looking for something sweet afterwards, I'd suggest TCBY next door (I wish I would have had room) for a tasty froyo treat."}
{"text":"Boy do I wish I had read the reviews before going to this \"sandwich\" shop, but I was in a hurry and hungry and didn't want to leave the C terminal. 

Based on some of the reviews, my customer service experience was different as I had a very pleasant young lady. I ordered a veggie sandwich (not heated) and a bag of chips. 

The sandwich, to say the least, was not appetizing. I should have had it toasted. Maybe that would have made it better so I only ate half of it and all of the chips. Certainly not worth the price I paid.

The only reason for not rating a 1 star was the customer service."}
{"text":"An ok sandwich shop given that it is in the airport. It's located across from C8.
When looking for something quick, not filled with tons of grease and looks & tastes like something you can make at home...this is it.

It's nothing to write home about because it should be hard to screw up a sandwich- two slices of bread, 
your hearts desire in the middle and either toasted or not.  That said it comes down to service.

It was a small crazy rush and somehow I made it to checkout without ordering. No problem. She took my sandwich order and payment.  Then she went back, put on gloves and made my sandwich.  cool.  I had the turkey sandwich with 3-4 toppings toasted.No problems here. Service and sandwich are ok by me.

There are tables to seat 18, 12 of the seats offer dual power sockets and a TV to catchup on the headline news.  Not a bad place to post up during a layover."}
{"text":"Decent food outlet in the Charlotte airport. Fresh sandwich for $7.99 not bad for airport prices!

I had ham & swiss with lettuce, tomato and cucumber on ciabatta and it was very tasty! Was pretty quick and friendly."}
{"text":"A bit confusing as to where to go, what to pick and where to stand in line, but when you are at an airport and hungry - it's amazing what you will go through to get a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"It was just after 7 a.m., I'd just arrived at Charlotte airport and wanted to grab something small before my next flight onto my final destination an hour later.

I really wanted a cheese danish from Starbucks, but as I passed the Starbucks kiosk in this concourse the line was about 30 people deep and I didn't have the patience to deal with that.  I came upon Fresh Attractions, there was only 1 person in line and whatta ya know, this place had the SAME cheese danishes as Starbucks!  Win!!

I grabbed a Danish and a bottle of milk and paid $5.50 for everything, or less than a cup of coffee alone would've cost at Starbucks. Double win!!"}
{"text":"Just paid $9 for a Chipotle Grilled Chicken Salad and there was no chicken on it. Annoying.  It's basically a kiosk, so by the time I realized it I was already at my gate."}
{"text":"Super gross \"panini\". I had to return for them to grill longer so that its wasn't cold. The second try didn't do much in terms of making the sandwich palatable. I ended up needing to pick off the gross tomatoes, bacon and cold chewy turkey. Ultimately, I ate overly greasy sourdough toast for $11. DON'T CHANCE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Decided to go here since the line across from it at the pizza place was too long. My flight was already boarding next door and I needed to get some dinner before my cross country flight. They made one of the best veggie sandwiches I've had at an airport. They started off with toasted sourdough bread and then piled the veggies on high! They didn't even make a face when I asked for extras of my faves (such as olives!) The only reason I took off a star was because they did not have avocado and for the price. $8 was a little steep for what it was without a veggie staple like avocado. I'd totally recommend this place to anyone wanting a custom sandwich though!"}
{"text":"A simple meal ruined. I just ordered a bacon egg and cheese. I wasn't given an option on to what bread is like. Walked to the register and was told $8.64!!  A $9 BEC!!! Now the kicker, inedible, the bacon was rubber they thought they were doing a favor by piling it on. At a normal place where the bacon is good, fine otherwise gross. WASTE OF MONEY."}
{"text":"Had a \"veggie wrap\" - whole wheat wrap with all the veggies and pesto.  This is a fantastic vegetarian / vegan option!  For $4.99 + tax I received a super tasty and very filling wrap!"}
{"text":"This place was right next to my gate and my flight was about to board so I decided to grab a bite from here -also because it looked like the only place where I could get food that wouldn't give me a heart attack. At any rate, the service was really fast which I appreciated and the wrap I got (turkey) was not bad. You can either get a pre-made panini (they didn't look good) or get a freshly made one for which you get to choose the ingredients; needless to say, I got mine made at the spot. I ended up paying $8.11 for a decently-sized turkey wrap with lots of veggies all of which were fresh. If you're around C-gates at Charlotte I'd recommend this place. Ingredients are fresh, service is quick, average sandwich place at an airport."}
{"text":"I needed to grab a quick bite before jumping on a connecting flight.  Fresh Attractions was right next to my gate and quicker than the Phillips Seafood (which is a million times better) on the other side.  Huge mistake.

I ordered a ham and swiss panini thinking a hot sandwich would be nice.  What I got was some sloppy, barely toasted mess.  The lady making the sandwich didn't care, the register lady (who overcharged me until I corrected her) didn't care.  The entire place didn't give a shit since honestly they're never likely to see you again.

For the random traveler passing through CLT a craptastic sandwich isn't too bad, but for road warriors like me a shitty food joint must be avoided at all costs.  Don't go to this half-assed place unless you are starving and even then I'd think long and hard about it."}
