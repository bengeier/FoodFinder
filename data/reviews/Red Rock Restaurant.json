{"text":"The only thing good at this place is the home burger and fries. For 4small chicken fingers I paid $7.95 before tax. They tasted old and over done. We have been going here for years and after always opting for the home burger we chose to turn it up a notch and try other items on the menu, with great disappointment it didn't live up to the hype. There is no hype."}
{"text":"Red Rock is a small restaurant in the Rexdale area.  I have been coming here for years.  Up until today they have my favorite burger.  The home burger is amazing fries are great.  I love the Poutine.  Red Rock is open late daily for all those people that get hungry even late."}
{"text":"Let's be straight, this ain't fine dining, but the point of a review is to grade it based on what it tries to be.  This is a great little joint.  Nothing fancy, but very clean and well kept, friendly, family run business.  They have a wide menu: Burgers of all kinds, two kinds of souvlaki, chicken, fish & chips, poutine, loaded poutine, multiple salads, tons of free toppings and more.  I go fairly regularly and have never been disappointed with anything I've had (burgers, souvlaki, fish & chips, poutine).  The fries are the thick straight cut kind that actually taste like potatoes, no coatings, no special flavoured salt, just real good regular fries with sea salt and you get to choose how to adjust the taste (gravy, plain, salt & vinegar, etc.)  They are licensed, and have a local bar next door with a patio who get there food from here, so if you want an alcoholic beverage and a great meal, this also fits the bill.

I have taken lots of friends there, one had the loaded poutine, that's poutine with lots of onions, tomato and ground beef on top of it (and maybe a few other things, it was hard to tell in that giant heap of food).  It alone filled him up and had to take his souvlaki home for lunch the next day.  The other endorsement comes from one of my nieces.  I took her there when i was taking care of her.  She got the chicken strips and fries.  She loved them (I don't eat strips, as I have always seen them as kid's food), and I was impressed that there was real chicken breast meat inside, instead of pressed chicken bits.  She loved them so much, her folks tell me she now prefers them over Harvey's, where her parents usually take her, and comments every time she likes Uncle Bart's chicken strips better (meaning Red Rock's).

So if you are looking for fine dining, go somewhere else.  If you want great chow-down food with great service, head to Rexdale blvd. between Islington and Kipling, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Decent little burger joint.
Family run by real nice people.
Good seating and parking.
Menu and food are exactly what you would expect.
Burger was fresh and fries crispy.
Worth a return visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time and it will be the last. We ordered the chicken souvlaki and the quality of the chicken was bad.... the rice was just plain steamed rice and the tzatziki sauce was horrible!!! The only thing I enjoyed was the salad. The prices are outrageous for the quality of food they serve. Just horrible...."}
