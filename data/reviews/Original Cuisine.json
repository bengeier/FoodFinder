{"text":"Went to this restaurant with my family tonight after that az central article, we will definitely be back! The entire staff was VERY kid friendly and provided actual children's cutlery and plates/bowls. They even brought them water in cute cups before they attended to us adults. I love that cause you know... children. The food was amazing, a little on the spicy side but not enough to be put off. Portions are a little tricky, some things were shareable and others were not. The restaurant was very clean as well as the bathrooms. It took a while to get the servers attention, but she was very nice and explained everything on the menu to us. She even gave us suggestions for next time! The only reason i gave 4 and not 5 stars is because of how long it took to get their attention to order and receive our check. But definitely coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Whew wee. I have not reviewed any restaurant in forever, but I'm excited to be back to Yelp. But whether you're looking for food, reading random reviews because you're bored, or looking for a place to taunt your friends (or enemies) on Snapchat or Facebook, I'm here to help.  In case you haven't noticed from the pictures and other reviews you may have scrolled through prior to this one, this is an ACTUAL CHINESE RESTAURANT. It pains me to see people paying for food that can be found in a Panda Express down the street; please for the love of god, don't be one of them. Try new things; you only live once.  For the restaurant and its ambience, I'd say the restaurant deserves...3.5 stars. Okay, but not great. Fortunately, they clean the floor (unlike some Chinese restaurants.) They wipe down the tables before you sit down, yet sometimes, they forget a few things. When I sat down with my parents, we realized we were missing two napkins, a plate, and a pair of chopsticks. We initially tried telling them, but after five minutes we eventually resorted to taking some from a nearby unused table. The mistake is subtle, yes, but it's a mistake nonetheless.  This brings me to my next subject: service. What it deserves...varies. If you were a waiter, maybe you enjoy putting fake smiles while seeing more customers when you just want to go home. Maybe not. That's okay. But on Yelp, however, you accidentally forget your customer's request for a cup of water (even once,) and BOOM. Potential five-star review goes, bye-bye. For us, that was no exception. It took a waiter seven minutes to get us water (yes, we were \"not very happy\" a.k.a. pissed), but someone else quickly came to our table and assisted us far better and faster than he ever did. (Which is why, unlike some reviews, I did not change a 5 to a 1 or 2.) Some waiters are better than others, so I cannot give a certain number for a quality that varies so much.  Finally, let's get down to the food, which I think is the most important part of any dining experience (4 stars). The pork belly on a rack was delicious, but the garlic sauce was quite concentrated. Experiment with the sauce to find that sweet spot. Otherwise, you get a breath strong enough to kill Dracula a mile away. The Ma Po Tofu was stronger and more potent than other versions that I've tried, so that's a plus there. The Sliced Beef and Pork Tendon in Chili Oil, however, was my favorite. The slices and quantity are quite generous, and it was cooked well (I don't mean well done. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. We are not here for a barbeque.)  Overall, I would say it was somehow worth the cost, but it's not the best I've seen. I'd say you should give it a try, but this is not the restaurant that is so good that I would smash down the restaurant door just to get the first table.  TLDR: Good food, sub-par service (at times), and moderately clean.  May your food choices be ever in your favor."}
{"text":"Um, I love eating frogs, but their frogs were disappointing. They water boil frog meat and then basically mix them with the sauce and stuff. Some desserts were ok but the actual meal was so off, compared to the Irvine location. Food is only a part of the restaurant, their service is even more disappointing. They don't care about you. They don't care about your food, and they DONT HAVE ENOUGH BOWLS!"}
{"text":"So after reading the great article on AZ Central I knew I had to give this place a try.  That opportunity came soon enough when my aunt and uncle came in town, and everybody wanted Chinese food.  So my brother knew about this place as well so we decided to come here on a Saturday night.  We ordered a variety of different dishes.  We all enjoyed them, expect for the Pork Belly and eggs with shrimp.  The group wasn't a big fan of those two dishes, but everything else was amazing!  The atmosphere was pretty simple, not a lot of tables but pretty roomy in there.  The service was another story.  I don't know what's wrong with my people, but generally speaking the service hasn't been the best, especially in the Phoenix market.  We constantly had to flag the waiter down for more water, rice, and napkins.  Nee House still has the worst service out of any Chinese restaurant I've been to.  Overall, the food itself is pretty solid.  Real deal Sichaun cuisine.  If you are looking forward to hot and spicy Chinese food, look no further!  Another nice feature is you bring your own beer!  I would highly recommend this place, but prepare for not so good service."}
{"text":"I must say this is true Szechuan the flavors textures the combination of different peppers"}
{"text":"We tried this place after reading an article from the local paper where the writer gave this place a 4.5 stars. I'm no expert in food writing but I do like to think I know good food. I've had other Szchuan food in other states and around the valley so all I can do is compare this place to my past experience of Szchuan meals. The menu here is truly authentic from the dry pots to the chongqi chicken to the variety of pork belly dishes. You also have the normal dishes everyone is accustomed to with fried rice, kung pao chicken and walnut shrimp.  Here is a breakdown of my order. Cold pork belly appetizer - no flavor, the garlic sauce it came with was bland.  Breaded pork ribs appetizer - the sauteed peanuts, peppers it came with had more flavor. The ribs were too dry and over fried. House fried rice - flavor was better, I would order this again. Not the soy sauce doused fried rice most Americans are used to which I love. Walnut shrimp - breading on the shrimp was too much and the sauce wasn't sweet so it tasted like mayonnaise on breaded shrimp. Chongqi boneless chicken - DELICIOUS, you must order. Little nuggets of awesomeness. Chicken dry pot - this is the reason for me returning. A mixture of chicken, pork belly, beef slices and veggies swimming in a hot chili oil sauce. Stomach buster!"}
{"text":"Service suck , me not even finished my dinner , the waiter just throw the check on my table ... I don't wan give any star , really ridiculous ..."}
{"text":"The 2nd location of Original Cuisine.  Their restaurant name and seemingly undeliverable promise nagged in my mind as I perused the menu before my companions arrived.  Being seated begrudgingly also weighed on my mind as I was coolly rebuffed upon requesting a larger table; fair enough at this point.        My fellows arrived and we contemplated what culinary treats to consume.  We started with waters + iced tea + fruit drinks.  By default your drinks come without ice, but upon request, they will provide.  Fair enough.  Questioning our server about what our potential choices entailed began our server's descent into insanity.  I could smell the fear as we dived into the mysteries of what is contained in Original Cuisine's dishes.  His hands shook and eyes wavered as he plead ignorance.  I google image searched Chong qing chicken and the terror receded as he admitted that matched what the dish should contain.  We ordered 2 portions of that, as well as the bbq catfish, braised pork belly atop pickled vegetables, and 2 plates of the egg fried + yang chow fried rice.   Looking around the restaurant and realizing the size of their serving receptacles, we repeated our request for a table migration, and was again denied.  Gazing longingly at the still empty tables that promised enough room for our food to roam free, we accepted our fate, and our dishes began arriving shortly after.  Looking in disbelief at the size of what began arriving, I asked again if he was sure there was enough space.  Our server accepted the realities of the physical universe and assisted us in moving to a larger table.   The fried chicken was passable, but straddled the line between aggressively salty and ocean water.  The signature tongue numbing of Szechwan peppercorns did not report in for duty, but the chiles were abundant, coating thin and crispy, chunks of chicken just slightly dry.    More enjoyable was the braised pork belly.  Deep flavors and perfectly fatty pork was paired with pickled, slightly bitter vegetable.  My guess was chopped collard greens but our server couldn't identify the veggie's true identity.  My dreams of competing in a palette challenge on Hell's Kitchen died yet again.     The egg fried rice was wonderfully fluffy, and egg was in much higher proportion than normal, but greatly appreciated here.  The yang chow portion added additional vegetables, shrimp, and pork and was quickly consumed by our quartet.    The bbq catfish dominated our table.  Fried to a wonderfully crispy exterior, with moist interior, this fish swam in a lake of incredibly flavored broth with a huge amount of chilies and just the right amount of oil.  Surprising and lovely were the huge amounts of vegetables the fish came with, which absorbed this broth perfectly, the lotus root and wood ear mushrooms being standouts.      The request to split the bill was met with multiple staff and protests.  Apparently they lacked the ability to accomplish this otherworldly difficult feat.  Feeling that this might not actually be true, our party engaged in a 15 minute debate with our server until the miraculous advancement in restaurant technology yielded the ability to pay for what each person ordered.  Our experience was nearing an end, yet it was not to be, as our server returned with the proclamation they don't take American Express.    The parade of staff ranging from indifferent to confused to hostile dampened this experience.  There are stereotypes of poor service in Chinese restaurants and typically I've found this to either be not true or outweighed by the food.  In this case the scales tip over on the side of never returning."}
{"text":"This place will serve you real-deal Szechuan food. That means big, bold flavors that lean heavily on garlic and chili peppers, and aren't afraid of salt and oil. If that scares you, I humbly suggest you (and Donna from Scottsdale) stick with PF Chang's and their more \"Americanized\" offerings.  The menu is not very detailed, but the servers were really helpful and friendly, and used ipads to show us pictures of the food we asked about.  Ultimately, we ordered the Special Sliced Fish in hot Chili Oil, Cold Noodles, and House Special Sliced Chicken. The chicken wasn't spicy at all; shredded chicken with cilantro and tiny bit of red chili pepper over a bed of slivered white onion and with a light savory sauce. The Cold Noodles were (I'm guessing) homemade vermicelli noodles with bean sprouts, garlic and minced chili peppers in a spicy cold broth. This was mild-medium, but nicely spicy. The Sliced Fish in Hot Chili Oil ... wow ... fairly large pieces of lightly coated fish along with bean sprouts, red chilies (and other yummy stuff, but not tomatoes!) adrift in an awesome broth (think really good, rich ramen stock) and a slick of hot chili oil across the surface. This one was hot, and amazing, and probably the dish that will pull me back again and again. Oh, and everything comes with white rice which you can use to moderate the heat impact.   The building is a little dumpy - my chair broke under me, it was too hot sitting next to the west facing windows, and my diet coke wasn't icy cold, but the food was amazing and I'll be back.  Get there early or expect to wait."}
{"text":"This spicy Sichuan Chinese restaurant is part of a chain of out of state eateries.  Excellent presentations and lots of food and spiciness. The water boiled fish red and yellow are huge and delicious and of best value. If you want it extra spicy, it can be so much that your tongue goes numb with the heat. The pork belly strips are hung and presented uniquely. The chicken wing mix dish is also a good deal and huge. The barbecue fish is also huge and well presented."}
{"text":"If you have read some of the other reviews you'll see that service is an issue.  Our group of 3 encountered the same experience at lunch on a weekday.  The staff were all young.  I did not see anyone who appeared to be older than 22 years of age.  Perhaps they need someone older with some customer experience?? The food was great.  The bok choy was outstanding.  Just about all of the dishes show on the menu with a little chili pepper symbols.  However, we did not find them to be all that spicy.  The 3 stars is for the service.  5 stars would be for the food. We'll return here but allow a little more time to pay the tab since they are slow at cashing out.  So, if you have a certain time available to you for lunch you may not want to dine here."}
{"text":"Crazy freaking good mapo, dry pots, green beans, and a ton of other szechuan yums. I eat a ton of szechuan in California (specifically hacienda heights), and my first thought was \"wow this is amazing like Cali szechuan\". Sure enough they're from California, and I cannot tell you how needed this spot was! I ordered extra spicy and they didn't even white wash it. Amazing food, very authentic."}
{"text":"This Mesa food area seems to have so many great Asian restaurants and it is now official that Original Cuisine is one of my new Sichuan favorites. Just look for the white building with the bright orange trim.  Only been here once and really enjoyed my meal. This location used to be a really bad Chinese fast food Restaurant called Happy Food. Trust me there was nothing happy about it. The new tenants really did a nice job fixing up the place and the inside dining area looks great. What a nice improvement.  Order the Twice Cooked Pork with a side of Fried Rice on my first visit. The flavors were definitely on spot and I could tell the chef knew this cuisine very well. The broad bean sauce and the fermented black beans that they use gave the dish both a beautiful taste and aroma. The Fried Rice was very good as well and had a nice fluffy texture that worked nicely with the sauce of the dish.  They have so many other dishes that I can't wait to come back and try. Their special BBQ Fish dish is calling my name and I can hear it from way down the street. The Dry Pot dishes with tons of Chili Peppers will definitely be the next thing for me to order. So many flavors and options to check out. Prices are reasonable. They do charge for rice which wasn't a deal breaker for me. Just letting you know in advance.  Service is friendly and sometimes a bit sparse. You will see them floating around and may have to wave them down if you really want something quickly. Wish they opened a little earlier as well. My job doesn't always allow me to take long lunches and it's always harder if a place is really busy.  Get prepared to enjoy some really good and tasty food. Hope to be back sooner than later and try some more of their Spicy Goodness. Maybe I can sneak back in the kitchen and check out some of his top secret sauces. I'm getting hungry just writing this review. ORDER UP!  4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this after a 4.5 star our of 5 star review in the Arizona Republic newspaper.  The food was terrible.  We got dishes based on the recommendation of the server and some of them were the house specials.  One was a dry pot with pork belly, shrimp, chicken wings and vegetables.  Terribly salty to the point of being unable to eat it.  We also ordered spicy vermicelli.  This was not vermicelli as you and I know it.  They were transparent cellophane noodles in an oily tomato broth with bean sprouts and some kind of crunchy nuts.  Again terribly salty and heavy on cumin.  The next dish was a shredded chicken with cilantro that was not edible due to the salt.  In fact, nothing was edible due to the salt.  The server also recommended the fried rice.  All this dish was is plain rice with scrambled egg in it.  It was the least salty food and the only one we could really eat.  There was only one other customer in the place and our server was not attentive at all.  She came only once to see if we needed anything and then after waiting 15 minutes to get our bill (she was busy talking to another server and then went outside for a smoke) we had to flag down someone else so we could pay and get the heck out of there.  We will never go back and cannot recommend in any way.  I intend to track down that guy that wrote the review in the paper.  He needs to have his head examined."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after reading Dominic Armato's review. It did not disappoint! The restaurant is rather un-assuming and very non-pretentious.  Even the names of the dishes on the menu are very black & white without a lot of colorful language.  \"Pork in spicy sauce\", \"potatoes with chile and vinegar\", \"House sliced chicken with chile.\"  But don't judge this restaurant by its cover. I ordered take-out (not ideal since they have some really great presentations), but the food was super tasty. The real-deal.  NOTE: You MUST like spicy food!!  Will definitely go back and eat on-site next time."}
{"text":"Special fish was ok tasting.  Not a very large serving for the size of plate.  Enough for 2-3 people. Rest of pork dish was rather forgettable.    Asked for rice at ordering. Never did receive them.   Asked for water once and then never got a refill.     Will not return for just ok food and terrible service"}
{"text":"Thirteen of us Wild Diners descended on Original Cuisine on SUN, 13 AUG. We had RSVP's for 16, but, as is typical w/ Meetup, there were 3 no-shows. At 2 PM, the restaurant was very busy, but our tables were ready, and the staff had no problems accommodating us. We ordered in courses, so that we didn't crowd the tables and to ensure hot entrees. Both tables had identical pre-selected dishes Service was good and our orders were quickly delivered.  1st Course: Szechuan Twice-cooked Pork (Belly?), Sze Dry-fried Green Beans, Deep-fried Chicken w/ Chili; 2nd Course: Winter Melon w/ Meatball Soup; 3rd Course: Sze House Special BBQ Fish. We never made it to the 4th course of Fried Eggplant w/ Sweet & Spicy Sauce & Spicy Pork Intestines - it was already plenty of food for most! None of us had had any selection before & everything was just excellent! Surprisingly, only a few dishes were medium spicy, but the onset of \"mah-la\" from the prickly ash made it such fun & clearly Szechuanse! Only the chicken missed the mark, being too salty. Servings were quite adequate to share. We left \"zero\" wasted food on the tables! The service was really friendly, prompt, and so helpful! When I was advised that the Winter Melon Soup was out, the waiter apparently saw my disappointment & went to the kitchen. He returned to say they were going to prepare two new orders just for us! WOW! W're so glad that they whippd it up; it was so good in the middle of our feast! We had to do a bit of our own bussing, but so what? We're used to doing that at \"authentic\" Asian restaurants. We all seemed to agree that this was a wonderful experience w/ excellent dishes, all for under $16/diner, including tax & tip. We are already planning a return to try many of the other enticing menu items - maybe spiced up a bit!."}
{"text":"First of all, I just got reminded that they do not provide complementary rice.Secondly, I noticed that I got charged a processing fee ( to run my credit card) on an order that's almost $50. I get it that certain small businesses charge customers with a small bill , say under $10. Yet, I'm getting charged almost $2 more for paying with card? Are you joking me? You are the business owner, if you decide to use POS, you pay for it. If you have already charged me for your service , then you pay for the damn POS charge, don't put it on me after you've already charged me. WTF??? Honestly ,your food is on point. But, I don't respect the way you run your business. By the way, you don't even have a phone number on yelp. Are you living in the Stone Age or what?"}
{"text":"Original Cuisine is a Chinese Restaurant that isn't for everyone that think they like Chinese Food. While not everything they offer is spicy they do specialize in Sichuan Food. Also this isn't a fancy place. To me it appears that this used to be a fast food restaurant. Service is good enough. Our order was taken in reasonable time and was taken correctly. We asked for extra napkins and didn't get any.  We were going to order the Spicy Fried Chicken but were told they were out of it when they were only open for less than an hour.......So we ordered some other dishes to share.  We started with the Pan Fried Rice Balls. They were like small eggs made of thin pounded rice and were filled with black sesame that tasted very much like tahini. The balls were seasoned with something that tasted brine-y and sautéed bell peppers. They were tasty but they also seemed rich so I had a bunch to bring home.  We tried the Lettuce in Garlic Sauce. The lettuce kept it's crispy stem and was served in a mild chicken based garlic sauce. This dish went really well as a chaser to our hot and spicy mouth numbing BBQ Fish.  The House Special BBQ Fish comes out bubbling hot in an oily chili based sauce on a big raised fired up tray. The fish is mild and meaty and was lightly floured and fried crisp. It covered with peanuts and chilies. It sits on top of wood ear mushrooms, lotus root and potatoes. I used my spoon and chopstick to pull pieces off. In the beginning you can pull off big pieces and eat them like fried chicken. It's very tasty. It makes my nose run from all the chili peppers but the mouth numbing peppercorns kind of mask the heat. I almost wanted more heat. This had heat but also was delicious. It didn't have that CRAZY heat that they serve you when you hit the cultural center. I'm not the best with chopsticks and I found the peanuts difficult to pick up with chopsticks so I used the spoon. I have to say this was quite a feast and I never had catfish that I enjoyed this much.  You might want to bring a fork from home and some extra napkins for your visit.  This was the best Sichuan Food since Miu's Cuisine.   4.5 rounded up because the food was great!"}
{"text":"Food was great!   However... Service was something you'd expect to be better, we'll say I won't be returning. Asking for a glass of water was a mundane task, and forget knowing what was included in a dish, waiter didn't seem to have a clue. The greeter, potentially also floor manager, seemed to be conceited for no apparent reason, and treated not only my party, but others with zero respect."}
{"text":"Let me start with a song...\"don't believe the hype\". Especially a certain someone from azcentral.com. We arrived to zero service and eventually were served water that tasted like lead. We ordered house special bbq fish, pork belly, and house special chicken. All three were served together and then we never saw our waiter again. The chicken dish tasted like every piece was dipped in vegetable oil and tossed on a plate with cilantro sprinkled on it for flavor. Easily one of the worst dishes I have ever tasted in town. The reason I gave an extra star (from 1) was the barbecue fish and the pork belly made up for it. But not enough that I would ever visit again. Lastly, i like BYOB, but no wine opener in the entire joint?"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype at all!   There was no one here and the service was terrible!!!!  It took forever to order and to get our check.  I kept smelling cigarette smoke from all of the workers smoking on the side.  I guess that's what they are doing instead of providing service.  They charge for rice!!!!  How annoying is that!  However, The fried rice was good...a little greasy.   But the beef tongue dish was not good.  The veggies have a weird taste and my scrambled eggs with shrimp were floating in grease.  It gave me a stomach ache.  We love authentic, unusual Chinese food just not this one.  There are better and cheaper places than original cuisine in the area!"}
{"text":"The Arizona Republic's Food Editor is NUTS! I was so awaiting dinner Saturday night. What a disappointment. Lo Mein noodles with scallions quite a small portion for the elevated price for a tasteless bowl of noodles with a mild sauce an less than 1/2 a scallion.  Fried beef dish also was small and had fatty, stringy beef with lots of cartilage...ugh. Also had onions, red and green pepper but did not say so on menu. Garlic noodles were just that chopped garlic in a mild sauce with noodles  Bottom line: small portions for high priced mild tasting food."}
{"text":"If you have an authentic Chinese food palate, this is the place for you.  I am forever looking for good ????spicy fried green beans (I don't remember how they translate it on their menu).  I was so happy to find this dish spot on.  We also had the old stand by of Kung Pao Chicken.... excellent!  No weird pink gelatinous sauces because China does not have weird pink gelatinous sauces on their Kung Pao Chicken. We only had two dishes the night we went, but looking at the other reviews, I can say that if you don't like spicy things or you don't like the Sichuan pepper-corn spice you would probably need to tell them because that is the taste of Sichuan food.  It was also great to see so many people there speaking Chinese.  From this, and the fact it was crowded on a Tuesday night,  you know it's good.   I would eat there everyday if I could."}
{"text":"First visit. I am not going to go into bloated details because everyone has expressed it already for the most part.   I purchased 3 dishes from the authentic menu, and two plates of fried rice. $49.xx   2 dishes, extremely oily, but on the bland side in flavor. Spicy yes but not really bad, flavorful no.  The other dish was pretty good.   I came in about 9:15 pm for take out, so I can't speak to the service side as others have.   The portions were on the average side at best. For the money I spent I was waiting to be wowed by the food and portion size but I was not.   This is the type of restaurant where you are either going to love it, or find it so so and really no in between."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in town. My parents were skeptical when I found this place, but they were quickly won over by the fresh and flavorful dishes!"}
{"text":"We had looked forward to going to this restaurant for months after reading a great write up in AZ Central and the wonderful reviews on Yelp. We love spicy food and we have never been so disappointed in a restaurant. First off, the waitress, very nice as she was, was absolutely useless when asked about the dishes. She had no clue and was utterly unhelpful. We decided to order three dishes to start with and planned to add others later. We are glad we only had those. The Dry Fried Beans were the best of the order. We had ordered fried rice, as we did not want the plain boiled rice and were presented with an extremely bland dish with barely anything in it besides warm rice. For $9 we expected more. The worst was the House Special sliced chicken; where was the chicken? We were not told that it was a cold dish and it almost consisted entirely of big chunks of raw onions with not much else. For $15.99 we expected at least some chicken in it rather than the very few cold shreds. We obviously did not order any more than we had initially planned and sadly will never come back, leaving the restaurant still hungry. We went there for lunch after shopping at Lee Lee's and would have had a much better Szechuan meal made at home."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is just horrible. Been here three times and each time they seem to mess up our orders. The waitress never apologizes for their mistakes and walks away with a dirty look(rolling her eyes). I do not like attitude with my meal especially paying around $80. It's really not that hard to add more vegetables to our dishes if you are going to charge us extra for it. I would not recommend this place unless you take it to go, but honesty I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok Chinese food, more specifically from the Mandarin side where they serve everything Szechuan style. Everything tasted fine, but again, every single flavor was dominated by that Szechuan spice. We ordered a lot of food for 4 people! We got the hanging pork belly, the mapo tofu, spicy soft shelled crab, the fish, stir fried green beans, and some kind of potato dish that looks like hash browns.   The mapo tofu was the best dish, but still kinda spicy in my opinion. The fish was very odd. Very hard to eat then eat off the dish and the presentation was kinda crazy! Good flavor but still, kinda spicy. The sauce for it was all oil too, and I'm kind of not used to having a community rice bowl for everyone to grab rice from. We each only had only small bowl of rice and I had to ask for a refill like 4 times because of this. I don't know if they charged for each refill. The spicy crab had good flavor too, but very difficult to eat the crab. The potato dish was too snippy, meaning they didn't cook it enough, maybe it's the style but I thought that was odd too. The green beans were good, but then again, it's good at most Asian restaurants I've been too.   All in all, I was excited about this place and was kinda let down because I guess I was expecting something different. The atmosphere was odd too because we were the only ones there, so it felt dead. The lights are very dim too, and they don't use AC, they use a swamp cooler, which makes this large firecracker noise every 10 minutes. Kind of annoying."}
{"text":"another chinese restaurant hit comes to the valley! dry pots are a great deal and definitely shareable. portions are extremely generous!"}
{"text":"Always fully packed. Make sure you call them in advance. They have their WeChat account too."}
{"text":"Unique versions of classics and new favorites. Prepare for the tingling of the traditional peppercorns. The sliced chicken would make a delicious and refreshing introdution for newbies to the experience."}
{"text":"Food is ok.. better restaurants of this type within minutes.. awful and odd service. Never brought drinks...finally tracked down water.. food is spicy so they need to check on people..Dumb as a post servers. Avoid."}
{"text":"Warning: If you think Panda Express is spicy,this is not a place for you. Also, if you consider ordering the Sichuan dish in your local Chinese is daring, stay away. Leave this outstanding place for those of us who want firey lips and unforgettable tastes. Oh yeah, come prepared to use chopsticks or bring your own plasticware. Another unique thing, the floral tea which is served warm, not hot. We shared two appetizers and an eggplant dish and had leftovers. As to what to order; just go for it. Food you have to try many kinds and times."}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I decided to try this place for dinner yesterday after going through a glowing review from AZCentral. Needless to say, we were looking forward to eating here.   I'll get right to the part any hungry person would care about: the food. It was great. Their House Special Catfish was definitely one of the highlights with the colorful presentation and just how well it marinated in the sauces. The Szchuan Pork was also flavorful and very tender. Overall, the combination of flavor and presentation was great.   However, there's a point where the quality of customer service outweigh my fondness for the food. The service was absolutely terrible. Let's start off with the portions of food in relation to the table sizes. Here were 4 of us and were each planning on ordering our own dishes. We were sat down in a small round table that we knew, right off the bat, was going to be an issue with the amount of food we were ordering. For a while, they refused to accommodate our request for a slightly larger table (there was a sea of empty larger tables in the middle of the restaurant) as those were only allowed for parties of 6. Of course, when they were placing our food on the table, they realized that they could not fit our orders. So they were finally convinced to move us to a larger table. We also had a server who either was very new or just had overall lousy communication skills; which was beyond the existing language barrier. He was sweaty, visibly nervous around us for no reason, and hardly knew how to answer basic questions about the menu. We also had to flag him down numerous times as he rarely ever checked in. We weren't exactly expecting someone who was absolutely in love with their job, but we also didn't expect service from somebody with very poor communication skills. He knew just enough to take our drink and food order, but God forbid you ask him literally anything else, it turned into a train wreck.   I wrote this novel of a review as somebody who generally has a ton of patience and relatively soft spoken. The  service was that bad; and I struggle to even recommend this to my friends or anyone because of it. Every staff member just had a downtrodden look in their face and it gave off a bad vibe from the very beginning. You come here for the food, of course, but be very weary and prepared for the service you're going to get. Judging by other reviews, I'm clearly not alone in this."}
{"text":"My partner loves Szechuan style Chinese food so I suggested we try this place after I read the AZ Central review for it. It's the real deal and the menu may throw you for a loop if you are only accustomed to eating \"Americanized\" Chinese food. There are lots of dishes featuring tripe/offal as well as a couple with bird feet (chicken, duck). We ordered the Szechuan pork belly, cold noodles, and a side of garlic bok choy. It was more than enough for two people with big appetites and we brought home leftovers of the sides. The pork belly was so effing good, I highly recommend it. The fat just melts in your mouth. The part that made it Szechuan style was the base the pork belly was served with which was some kind of spicy fried onion and possibly mushroom mixture (we couldn't really figure it out to be honest). The cold noodles are served in a chili oil that is a really nice kind of spicyness, where it just kinda coats your mouth and makes it tingle but doesn't choke you out. The bok choy was not spicy so it was nice to alternate spicy and non-spicy, for me at least because I am weak.   All in all, what we ordered is what we lovingly refer to as \"white people spicy\". I am sure though that there are far hotter things on the menu if you want spice, or you could simply ask them to make it hot and I'm sure they would oblige.  The service was a little slow when it came time to get our bill, but they are apparently VERY busy and popular right now so it's nothing to complain about since they were still attentive at refilling water so it's not as if they were ignoring us. Asian restaurants typically have much more hands-off service and you have to be understanding of this (personally I like this).  Also they do carry-out and delivery!"}
{"text":"This was my first night trying out this place for authentic Chinese food, had a great dinner and was very pleased with the food. Ordered Mapo Tofu and Dry pot with rib, the flavor was wonderful but wish the portion could be bigger and rice could be free as most of the Chinese restaurant. Overall it is definitely a great place for authentic Chinese food."}
