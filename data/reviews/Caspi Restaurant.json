{"text":"Great place to eat. Drove all the way from New York just try this place. Home cooked food I could not stop eating. Good stuff."}
{"text":"A hidden Russian gem by Keele and Steeles. They serve many traditional Russian dishes. The eggplant rolls were tasty. The khinkalis reminded me of tibetan momo dumplings with a juicy meat filling. The tabaka or hen was cooked with the skin crispy and the meat tender and not overly dry. Would come back again to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"4 stars for authentically home-cooked meals by a lovely lady and exceptionally delicious chicken skewers.   We ordered dolma (stuffed vine leaves), kutabi (thin crepe-ish thing stuffed with meat and available vegetarian form), harcho (meat and dill soup), borsh, chicken and beef shish kebab, and khinkali (I think that's the dumplings...)   Chicken Shosh kebab was exceptionally tender and juicy.   Harcho and borsh looked similar in colour to each other. I would've preferred more dill seasoning in the harcho. The borsch didn't have the usual beet colour and tasted more like a meat-vegetable soup -- that was the only disappointing dish.   Kutabi was interesting...thin and nicely seasoned meat on the inside. Not sure what the sauce was, but it wasn't my favourite. Could be an acquired taste. However, it seemed pricey at $15.   We were surprised that only one lady was cooking! We came here early Saturday afternoon, and it was pretty empty.   It's also a family restaurant, which I liked -- they literally had some family photos on the walls."}
{"text":"This was a very good, definitely recommend to anyone.  All the dishes we ordered was very good.  Definitely get the cheese bread with egg dish.  The leaf wrapped dish is also really good.  Don't get why it was so empty when I went on Saturday night.  I think it's on par with Suliko."}
{"text":"Great and authentic eastern European food. As close as you can get to some food you can only find east of Poland."}
