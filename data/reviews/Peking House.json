{"text":"This is the best around. They use quality ingredients. They're quick and flexible (they'll adjust dishes to your request like extra spicy, white meat chicken only, etc.). The food is always fresh and tasty. This is #1 for me, ahead of Sesame Inn and Silver Palace. Oh, very nice people here too."}
{"text":"We gave this a second try after our first experience but again the food here is extremely bland. No flavor. It was warm but excessively oily. The sauce is runny and even the fried rice had no flavor. After seeing a lot of positive reviews we thought our first time was a inconsistency but unfortunately, that is not the case. People must enjoy bland Chinese food. So the search for a favorite local Chinese place continues."}
{"text":"Not very good. Food is very oily as others have said.  I would give a 1.5 star if possible. 

The vegetables seemed fresh and meat (beef and chicken) was of a decent quality, but their cooking/sauces were terrible. 

Also, it is more expensive than other Chinese places in the area and has smaller portion sizes. 

Overall, would not recommend."}
{"text":"A great takeout environment. Not the best place to dine in. The cashier was extremely friendly and knows her Pittsburgh sports. 

We had the orange chicken, sesame chicken, wontons, egg rolls and fried rice. Everything was very good and fresh. The wonton dough was very light and flakey, as was the egg roll. They know how to cook real Chinese food. You could tell it was fresh and the oil wasn't old. If it wasn't homemade, they fooled us!

Plus, it was very inexpensive. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

{"text":"I had heard good things about Peking House from a friend, so I decided to go try it out. It's nestled in Bavarian Village in South Park, and if you weren't looking for it, there's a good chance you'd miss it. However, it's worth stopping in if you're down in that area.

I went around 4pm on a Saturday, so I was the only person in the restaurant. There were 5 or 6 tables, but I can tell that a lot of people call in their orders to-go. The server knew two out of the three men who came in to pick up orders, so I could tell that this place was good enough to keep people coming back.

When I first looked at the menu, it did seem a bit pricey, but the portions they give you are enough for two meals. I ordered crab rangoons and pork lo mein. The crab rangoons came straight out of the fryer, so I had to wait a little while for them to cool down, but they were fairly good. The filling didn't have much flavor on its own, but the sauce they brought out with them (I assume it's a plum sauce) took care of that. The pork lo mein was flavorful and, as I said, large enough that I took half of it home.

My one last critique is that I wish they had a soda fountain--when you order a drink, you just buy a bottle of it. However, the staff is incredibly friendly and I had a nice time dining there. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Good food, but not the best I've had and just didn't explode my mind with flavor like other chinese places have done.

Hot and sour soup tasted pretty good but you should know it had the consistency of brown gravy? Like it jiggled like jello. I wanted soup n it was not a liquid"}
{"text":"Nice little Chinese restaurant right down the road.  Huge selection of choices, never had a bad meal.  The people are super friendly, and meals are always ready on time.  

It's nice having a place like this close by."}
{"text":"It's cheap Chinese food.. Not much too see here.. I wanted to give it it 2.5 stars, but Yelp is pretty behind... I am a fan of the Low me in dishes, and they aren't that good. All their dishes are usually soggy.. Cook your food longer? Use less sauce? But again usual Chinese place, staff is nice but not too nice. Standard prices , fast service"}
