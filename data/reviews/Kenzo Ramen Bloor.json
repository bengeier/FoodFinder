{"text":"For the record, I would actually have given them a 2.5/5, but there are no 0.5's.
I ordered miso ramen here.  It tasted okay, but I wish they served bigger portions.  I wouldn't say the price is unfair, but considering the food wasn't amazing, perhaps they could compensate with a bit more quantity? With that being said, Kenzo might be a place I'd go to if I happen to be in the neighbourhood and craving ramen, but if I was hungry, and not craving ramen specifically, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The ramen out here is amazing. For the first time I decided to try something else other than my favourite ( king of kings) and went with the Nagasaki Champon (Seafood noodles). They were really generous with the shrimps, squids, clams and the soup tasted almost as good as the king of kings. Another great experience at a great restaurant."}
{"text":"On a busy downtown Toronto street that literally has 3 or 4 Japanese restaurants on every block for a stretch of 7 or 8 blocks, how does one stand out from the competition? You stand out by being one of the only ramen noodle joints in the neighborhood. 

My wife and I only ordered the special tonkotsu ramen, so we can't comment on the other dishes. If you are a true ramen connoisseur, this is the one to get. The pork bone based broth is rich and milky, the noodles are bouncy and not overly filling, and the cha shiu was cooked just long enough to be tender and tasty. 

This is not a huge joint, but we were surprised by how quickly the food came out. Service is typical, so don't expect 5-star treatments here. It's a neighborhood joint to grab some good noodles and get on to other exciting things you have planned for your day."}
{"text":"I needed to grab a quick bite to go before class.  I asked if they do take out and the answer was yes. I proceed to order gyozas and wait patiently....15 mins later I enquire about my order and she said it's coming up next. Then the male waiter comes and points to 2 stacked chairs and tells me to sit down; and that gyozas take 15 mins to make. I said they should warn their customers...let's just conclude that service was terrible. I told him he was being rude and that I won't coming back and he saids you are rude. 

I gave 2 stars because the food was good. Too bad they are so slow and service is non existent."}
{"text":"I disagree with a lot of the reviews on here... Just to be clear I went to this exact location on Bloor.

Food: Meh. Not that great. I had higher hopes. I had the Tonkotsu and nothing about it was super delicious. The noodles were okay but it didn't taste that different from my Shin Ramen... The soup was tasted good, but it tasted like MSG. The pork slices were okay, nothing special for a person coming from a Chinese background, and there were only 3 pieces. And there was a LOT of vegetable condiments, which were only bean sprouts and shredded green onion. The portion size was also quite small for the price that it was. The presentation of the ramen was very nice though.

Price: It was pretty expensive! Basically I got the Tonkotsu ramen and a cup of tea (which was $1 btw) and I paid $14 including tax and tips. For what it was, I would have felt better if it was around the $10 range. 

Service: I thought was so-so. Could've been better but it wasn't horrible. It took a pretty long time to get their attention when we wanted to order and when we wanted the bill. 

Ambiance: I really like the interior of this store. Very modern and everything was cool toned which was relaxing.

Overall: It was so-so. Everything was just \"okay\". Nothing spectacular at all. For what it is, taking the food and the price into consideration, I would not visit Kenzo again. I'd rather try something new for $14!"}
{"text":"I have been to all other Kenzo locaitons and this one was the last of my trip.

Service was fast, and the food was good. 

Considering where this one is located--UofT and Korean town, their price and the service delivered make this place highly recommended.

Compared to the other locations, this one has much better allocation of space between the tables. Dundas one is far too crowded and Uptown one has very few tables. And the Wellesly one their service was slow."}
{"text":"This location gets 4 stars for consistency - consistent service (they do the best they can, busy or not), consistent quality and quantity of food over a period of a year, and some of the best effing gyoza I've ever had in Toronto. 

I come in here coz I live in the Annex and it's good, clean food considering the crappy sushi and pizza places in the neighborhood. 

It's not as good as Kiton Ramen on Baldwin, but it's scores for its affordability and it's location for me. 

Don't come in when you're starving at peak hours; don't order the takoyaki or the gyoza at the same time as the noodles you won't get them as apps; it's not great for big strollers or big groups of people; AND if you are STILL here after all that- DON'T BLOODY LINGER. 

Have some civic-mindedness aka self-awareness. It's too bright to make out here so leave when you're done food and give the rest of us salivating hungries your precious seat. 

Thank you."}
{"text":"well, I shouldn't order katsu don at ramen place but I did.... mistake. the crust of katsu was soggy, it should alway be crispy. miso soup was a bit salty side with tiny cut tofu and seaweed. i paid $14 including tip. I guess I should never expect too much to non japanese people to make a real Japanese food. i wish i had a big ball to walk out when i realized this place was run by korean.. I won't go back.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite Ramen place in all of Toronto. The prices are great for really good Ramen and it's never too busy. The staff are always very welcoming and the atmosphere is outstanding. Noodles (thick or thin) are delicious and cooked perfectly in the flavourful broth of your choice. You can make your dish as spicy or mild as you desire. You can also pack your food to go as the dishes are almost enough for 3 people. The food comes very quickly and the servers are always organized.  This place is great and I defenintly recommend."}
{"text":"Definitely a decent spot.  I got the orochong ramen and the medium broth had me tearing up from spiciness!  There was lots of chicken, green peppers red peppers and mushrooms in the soup.  For 8.50 it wasn't mind bogglingly good but it definitely hit the spot.  The service is extremely attentive and polite.  Never had to worry about whether or not they'd notice that my water was empty (big deal to me because it was so spicy) and the bill came very quickly after we finished.  Ramen isn't my favourite dish on the planet but I can't deny that Kenzo offers good bang for your buck in the category."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Dundas location so I thought it would be nice to check out this location. It's definitely bigger than the Dundas location and the furniture looked nicer/more modern.

It was pretty busy when we arrived and some tables were not cleaned yet so these people who were sitting and eat (I assume they were the owners?) got up and clean a table for us. They even got us water and took our order because the servers were really busy.

Food was alright not super amazing but definitely better/more authentic than other places. Also, the service seems like it could be improved by hiring more waiters. If the owners weren't there, our time spent would be equally half eating and half waiting."}
{"text":"Sick of Sushi? Go for Ramen.
Fast, Fresh and delicious. A little cramped with the seating arrangments, but well worth it.
I can't get enough of the noodles, and the prices are great too.
As with most Asian places, I try not to evaluate the washrooms."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Kenzo, it's pretty damn good ramen made by non-Japanese, non-artisan noodle makers.

You can definitely taste the Korean influence in the King of Kings dish.. watch out if you get level 3 (spiciest).. it's not blow-your-head-off but beware (especially if you are a slurper).

I've been to all 3 locations (Annex, Dundas and newest on Yonge) they are consistent.   I will continue to go to Kenzo because it's the best I've had downtown (better than Ajisen, Inoodle, Liberty noodle) but that said, I have not been to j-town. 

My only criticism would be that the sodium level is high and I do suspect MSG (gotta have a bit but I think there's a bit too much).

Service is mediocre and portions are large.. well worth it."}
{"text":"I walk by this place all the time, and it's unfortunate that they don't advertise that they have vegetarians option in their window display.

The vegetarian ramen was a deal breaker for me. I am already thinking about when to go again. The service is extremely fast, just the way ramen should be."}
{"text":"I love the \"King ramen\" and the \"Baked dumpling\" of Kenzo ramen in Dundas, and miss the taste because I don't live in Toronto anymore."}
{"text":"We liked deluxe $14 fish soup on first visit. Went back and it was little more than water and one mussel and 4 shrimp. Service both times was thoroughly inattentive, par for the course, of course.

So annoyed, wrote to HQ. No answer in a week or so. Phoned store and spoke to owner who REFUSED to give me HQ phone number, any adjustment, or to be in the least interested in my complaint. Just plain hostile."}
{"text":"I really enjoy it here. The food tastes great and the price is very reasonable. The service is good, the staff are friendly and the restaurant is always clean... and it's a five minute walk from my house - what more could I ask for?!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good Ramen. 
The price range is from $8-$14.

I ordered one of the pork ramens from their \"recommended list\" and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I am partial to noodles...I love instant noodles. This is the high end version of instant noodles. Delicious. All their appetiters are wonderful treats filled with flavor."}
{"text":"Best ramen hands down in TO.  

Was awesome to find this place!  Went with Japanese couple who were in heaven.  Lived in japan in the past and this was the only time I've ever had anything remotely similar to the ramen there - this was identical.

Had the sapporo ramen and the shoyu ramen - delicious chewy fresh noodles and extremely authentic pork totally hit the spot.  This place deserves to be very successful!"}
{"text":"The ramen is not bad, but every time I come here I get really crappy service. The waiters and waitresses seem pretty obnoxious and really don't care about providing a welcoming atmosphere. Once we asked for less spice in one of the ramen and it turned out exactly the same spice level as the regular one. The owner here has also rudely told us to leave soon because he wanted to close up. Have learned to turn a blind eye to their attitudes when I go here now."}
{"text":"Well, I must say that we were stupid, as before entering we checked the huge billboard on the window with delicious food photos and decided to have Yakisoba - original Japanese roasted noodles with vegetable. So stepped in and not concentrating on the menu ordered one to share, as meat-eater and vegetarian agreed on vegetarian option, which is how in our opinion Yakisoba should come.

We put in our order and the food came fast, was breathing on a hot plate and smelled good, but then I noticed a piece of something which I thought was a mushroom, but turned out to be chicken! WTF! We were both surprised, but as we asked from the waiter, well yes, it comes (duh!) with meat also and this is where it got not so exciting anymore. The waiter would have confirmed which we want, as we were fooled by an outside ad. Totally our own problem, I know, but still... 

So half of the time I spent trying to get the little pieces out before getting the food on my plate, and the other half was too short to remember how the food tasted like. Hahaha, it was of course good, but tasted a bit like disappointment...

I am sorry."}
{"text":"I went around 6pm on a weekday, I got seated instantly and ordered right away. I got a Sho-Yu Ramen for a bit over $10. The broth was insanely good, the noodles average and the toppings very scarce (two tiny pieces of fatty pork). It tasted good but not entirely worth it if you're going for the noodles or toppings.
- Might go again."}
{"text":"I like that this place uses ramen noodles instead of the noodles that resemble spaghetti noodles at Ajisen. The service was great, quick and to the point. The presentation was really clean and nice, and it tasted really great too!"}
{"text":"Cheap and fast service.  
My only complaint  is that the tables are pretty close together.

I had the Mi-So Ramen, not too salty - just right."}
{"text":"Food was good, prices not bad. Environment was nice as well. Good service, I would go again. But nothing really amazing."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Kenzo so many times. I've enjoyed my experience at Kenzo almost every time. Kenzo is super good at serving out your food orders fast which is a plus. However, the downsize of Kenzo is that after eating there, you might feel a bit dehydrated because there's more msg in the broth.

One time I had a meal at Kenzo, I felt super dehyrdated for a period of time probably mostly due to the msg they used. I just wish Kenzo could make still make tasty ramen minus the high sodium and msg."}
{"text":"The food is about 3 and 1/2 stars but because of how consistent it is I gave it a 4. Service is just like any other Asian restauraunt, don't expect it to be amazing. This place is small and doesn't sit many people but most people don't linger after there meals so you won't have to wait very long to sit down. I recommend getting the King of King's, it has a little bit of everything; pork, fish, egg, seaweed and of course naruto. It is a little bit spicy, just enough for a good burn, even my white friends handle it well. The both is rich and blends well with the fresh seaweed. It's a ton of food, and I find myself bloated after eating it. The Onigiri is worth taking a try of as well. I didn't like the salmon, but the chicken is pretty decent. Great place to get a quick bite for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I think that the Tonkotsu and the King of Kings can both be a lot of fun if you are in the right mood. 

The King of Kings is filled with so many funny meat bits that it's like a bacon cheeseburger ramen. I'm just a sucker for all the funny little treats (one weird old tip!) that you find in that bowl. Plus the sauce (is it called broth?) is funny and spicy. See: It's fun! Don't worry...there's no cheese in the bacon-cheeseburger ramen...but it's just kinda burger shaped. 

I just got back from Vancover. They have some of the best ramen (in canada) there (so they say). and, in sooth, the ramen there was better than here....BUT it wasn't like that much better. Maybe I just don't know. I\"m still trying to figure it out. 

Soooooo. about the tonkotsu. There is something milky about it. Milky pork. Soo good to think about those words, and then to taste those words in sauce form (is it a broth or a sauce? I am so confused!) This one has less stuff in it. But the Cha siu (is that what you would call it?) is pretty tender. Could definitely be tenderer, no question, but it's the tenderest game I know of in town. Not game...like wild game...but game like if restaurants were games you played and one of them was the tenderest. 

DON'T order the other things. The other things are all stupid."}
{"text":"I don't get it. People go to a place that has ramen in the name and complain that it serves... uh, ramen. 

Loved Kenzo Ramen on a frigid winter night. Hearty Tonkatsu ramen, with a rich pork-bone broth, yummy chunks of pork, a daub of spicy garlic on the side of the bowl that you can mix in or leave out (depending on who you're planning to be kissing later the same day, I suppose). My (much) better half went semi-healthy with the Sapporo ramen, a slightly larger bowl, full of veggies and miso goodness. Gyoza app came after the soups - the only timing misstep - and we were so full we took half the order home.  

And all for less than $30.

Just what we needed - can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Considering the fact that I went in around 4 in the afternoon, the service was rather fast, friendly, and warm. However, the interior itself was not particularly appealing.
I've been here a couple times before, and I really liked the fact that they decided to finally upgrade from plastic cups to glass cups to serve water in.
I got the Karachi Ramen and asked for extra spicy, I was very pleased when they had 3 levels of choice. One thing that is really awesome about this place is that they don't charge you for it. 
The food prep was rather fast and the serving was more than enough. The noodles were very well cooked and I liked that the cabbage was stirred fried beforehand. 
Also, the pricing is friendly for student's wallets."}
{"text":"FYI: I'm giving the \"kings of king\" ramen a 2...not the entire restaurant.

It was under the \"spicy\" section of the menu. It wasn't that great. Maybe I expected too much, but what else was I supposed to think when everyone suggests to get this one. It wasn't spicy at all (at least for me), the noodles were too thin, and they didn't have that nice chewy texture that freshly made noodles are supposed to have. There were also too many veggies--to the point where halfway, I wasn't even eating noodles anymore, but pure bean sprouts and onions. I was hoping the meat would be marbled and tender. Meh. It was standard.

Also, their hot tea wasn't brewed in-house, but rather some unknown brand tea bag in a cup. That was disappointing and generic.

I will say that their takoyaki balls were amazing tho! Love them. Better than guu's. And everyone else's ramen looked way better, so maybe it was just the \"unluck\" of my choice. 

I still would recommend this place because each ramen on the menu has a different broth, different noodles, and different toppings, so I am sure I will find one I'll absolutely love.

Also, customer service is great! One of the waiters, hesitant at first, asked us to move tables to better accommodate a party of 6. We gladly moved as our food wasn't there yet, the other table was literally a sidestep away, and the party had been waiting long before we even arrived. For all the \"trouble\" it caused, the waiter gave us a $5 off coupon for our next meal. Yay!

He really didn't have to. I wasn't expecting anything at all. But hey, I ain't complaining. After that gesture, I knew how much they cared about keeping their customers satisfied."}
{"text":"I looooove Ramen! It's one of those foods I could eat everyday forever and ever! Unfortunately I mostly eat it at home from packages and a mix of veggie and meats I pick up at the grocer. Never had \"real\" Ramen, that is until I found Kenzo. 

True Ramen is taken very seriously in Japan, the recipes for the soup stock are closely guarded secrets from one Ramen house to the next. It's somewhat of an art form. Though Kenzo is more of a chain restaurant than an independent Ramen house it does do well to rise above the western concept that Ramen is something students eat from store bought packages. They make their own noodles and broth from scratch and there are a number of different varieties to be had. 

I went with the hot Sapporo-style Ramen to which I was given a choice of three levels of spiciness. Not knowing what \"hot\" means to Kenzo I decided on level 2. My Ramen came promptly and I quickly dived in with my chopsticks and spoon. I was loving every spoonful and five minutes later I was crying hot tears of joy. I gobbled it up!

The decor is simple modern Japanese, not too fancy nor fast-foodish. There is a big poster of their logo, a cartoon Japanese chef, on the wall who stares at you angrily, daring you not to like the Ramen. Well there is no complaints from me. Service was excellent though I went at a time the restaurant wasn't that busy. The waitress seemed to anticipate my every need and checked on me regularly, which may or may not have been inspired by me sobbing over my spicy hot Ramen. 

I am a fan and anticipate coming back to Kenzo as often as I can. I love Ramen!"}
{"text":"I've been to both the Dundas and Bloor locations of this restaurant, and for some reason, I get the feeling that the Dundas location was better. Some of my friends who have been to both have intimated to me the same thing. I wonder why?

On my trip to this Kenzo, I got the standard Tonkotsu ramen, along with an app of takoyaki. The person I was with ordered a Sapporo Miso Ramen. Service was quick and efficient, nothing too special. I rather liked the ramen bowl decoration near the entrance.

When the food arrived, I was pleased to note that the Tonkotsu was of a similar quality to Dundas' version. The Sapporo Miso ramen however, left much to be desired. Perhaps it was a bad day, but they had burnt the vegetables and just put them into the soup, leaving it with a rather unappetizing charred, bitter taste. Thankfully the takoyaki tasted rather good. I actually like these ones more than the ones offered at Mampuku.

For a full review, please visit my foodblog, located conveniently in my profile. Cheers! :)"}
{"text":"It was meh. I was hungry, had done some 'sportsing' just before going on a hunt for food and this place was close. It was pretty much empty on a Thursday night save for another couple. 

Ordered a bowl of Kings ramen I believe and it came out in less time than it took to walk to the back and input the order. I don't mind speed but a Subway sandwich took longer to make, which leads me to believe that things were not made to order, perhaps assembled but certainly not fresh.

The taste was ok, I was in one of those, \"I'm so hungry I'll eat anything, right now\" moods (due to the sportsing) so I didn't properly assess.

Definitely wasn't at the top of my Ramen experience list but good enough to feed the machine (me).

I'll give the ol'girl another try next time I'm in the hood

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"- sorry kenzo. this location is just as futsu (japanese for average/plain) as the other spot on dundas.
- i mean, ramen is always a nice/different alternative to pho. and the fact that the noodle bowl is doors away and is garbage (sorry noodle bowl)... this is better choice on a winter day.
- i read earlier that the decor is like ikea. it is.
- had the tonkontsu ramen. and there was baby bak choi in it. fail. 
- the gyoza were mad oily. full of filling. but the chef definately drenched and drowned them."}
{"text":"Came here twice with friends and experienced different culinary delights both times! It's a reliable little joint that serves one of the most authentic ramen in all of Toronto. Went to the one on Bloor and found the service to be fast and attentive. The food arrived pretty fast too and the entire group was quite satisfied by their respective orders. The quantities are massive and we'll worth their price. All in all a solid place for a good hearty meal!"}
{"text":"Service: terrible.
Taste: mleh, I could probably make it at home.
So it really comes down to service which was, again, terrible.
We go around 7pm on a Tuesday -- sure, lots of people in already, I get that they're busy. We sit down, the waiter comes a couple minutes later with an incredibly pedantic tone: \"you shouldn't sit down yourselves like that. It confuses us.\" Ok... Didn't see a \"please wait to be seated\" sign, but whatever.
We flag to order but it takes a long while. Finally the waiter comes after serving the table beside us twice, we ask what the chassu ramen is (it was a flyer that came with the menu). To be honest, if you don't have ANY descriptions on the page, and neither on the menu, you're bound to get some questions. So we ask what is in it, how it's different from this particular ramen, and the waiter cuts off: \"excuse me, but do you need another moment to order?\" Um, no, we're going to order now, we're just curious about what we're about to put into our mouths. So that was... Not good. We actually thought of leaving, quite pissed off at the waiter's rude comments and intonation. Nevertheless, we waited and got our food. $8.50 plus tip for what I could make at home (without putting up with all that cr*p too)? Not my game. Plus the \"spicy\" was like weird, painful spicy, not the kind of feeling good, tasty spicy. My nose starts to run, and I flag down a waitress for napkins. I'm dying, and she doesn't come. We flag her down again for the bill. She comes with the bill ah-ha! Then she says \"I'll get your napkin.\" Ok, wouldn't plucking out a couple napkins be quicker than selecting the table on the computer screen and printing out the bill? Anyhoo...
Not going back. Sorry, would not recommend."}
{"text":"A solid 3 1/2 stars. Seating feels a little cramped but the service is quick and efficient.

My friend lived in Japan for 4 years and loved the Ramen there. She suggested this place a few years ago and I've been coming back ever since. The menu is fairly small consisting of two sides: Gyoza (pork dumpling) or Takoyaki (octopus balls).

I always get the Tonkatsu Ramen. It's foggy rich broth and tender pork always warm me up.  For some reason, there are always two Ramens on the menu that are pictured but never available. I tried some of my boyfriend's King of Kings at it was good, but lacked the depth of the Tonkatsu.

The helpings are of a bigger size than other places and the value is decent. I'd come back here anytime for a steaming bowl of hot noodles and a beer!"}
{"text":"Authentic bowls of delicious ramen noodles just like I've eaten in Japan with quick friendly service and reasonable prices make Kenzo Japanese Noodle House worthy of repeat visits.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"For the price, you can't beat it! Amazing ramen and dumplings! I would give it a 5 if the service increased a bit. Sometimes it takes a really long time to get someone's attention for something as simple as the bill or a refill on water, but it's like $7-$12 for a solid dinner out. My partner and I were just there last night, and people were waiting out the door for a seat! Perfect food on a snowy day. :)"}
{"text":"Good and decent ramen; definitely a good option near Eaton Center (which has the WORST food options i've ever experienced for a huge mall; Eaton really needs to review its food options)

But nowhere close to an experience like Katana-ya in SF. I got the King of Kings Ramen; noodles were skinny (much skinnier than i'm used to for ramen), soup was pretty good but nothing outstanding. 
They claim to have 5 toppings in the ramen, but i'm not sure what they were or how they're diff from other ramens...and it definitely does NOT come with gyoza like someone yelped (very misleading, yo)

My fave thing of the meal- Icea Green Tea Matcha Latte. Very good and addictive...! Ramen was a little pricy for what it is, but honestly...it was not a bad experience at all. Service was fast and friendly. Would definitely be back if i were around the area and needed a quick, fast meal"}
{"text":"Have tried a couple different ramen places and the taste here does not disappoint. Came here with a group of 12 and the staff were very accommodating of us and moved some tables and chairs around to sit us. It's pretty comfortable here and their food presentation is pretty good. Only down side is I wish they had a bigger selection on their food menu! 

I got the sho-yo ramen here."}
{"text":"cute place even though it's just a chain restaurant. nicely made decorations and yummy food. except that they only have so few vegetarian options. I vote for more. 
the service was quick and friendly. 

and there is a feeling of a cafeteria when you're inside. maybe it's just furniture... meh. not bad if you're on the run."}
{"text":"Here I am, back again at different location this time. The wait staff are about the same as the other Kenzo by the Eaton Centre.  The ramien is good but seem to drop in quality. Still way better than the stuff you get in packages at the grocery stores. I would probably come here about once every 2 months.

Go for the food - but be willing to be patient with the wait staff."}
{"text":"In the Annex.  Let's try ramen!  Kenzo is a cute cozy space that holds approx 30 noodlers.  Tofu nuggets, to start were light crispy pillows of heaven.  Nagasaki champon was a delicious broth with al dente ramen noodles, 3 plump juicy shrimp, snippets of squid, and two New Zealand mussels.  The bowl is deceptively small looking but a very generous portion of goodness.  Definitely coming back for more!!! Rah rah for ramen!!"}
{"text":"It started as a good idea on a cold day. It turned out to be an annoying waste of time and of hard earned dollars. Admittedly I am a ramen snob and the ramen here, both miso and shoyu (plus tonkotsu) is comparable to a 3 maybe 3.5 star ramenya for flavor, greasiness and noodle texture: not the best, but still good and not too generic. Because of that flavorful mediocrity, the prices for it are an absolute insult to the ramen gods. People, this is street food, not some gourmet New York nouveau cousine concoction by a Michelin-rated kitchen.  On a similar note, the gyoza were mediocre, and the takoyaki was cooked in a paste that is definitely not the takoyaki paste - on top of that it was sweet - what's up with THAT?!

Perhaps because it was the long holiday, the service was actually non-existent for long stretches. When the cute waitress showed up, always in a foul mood, she had the logo of the restaurant pasted on her face: a scowling old man.

Girl, stop the scowlin' and give me some food I love!"}
{"text":"Netsu Ramen review (highly recommended!)
Price: 11.50 pretax n tip - good price for their larger than regular portion.

Meat option: ground pork or chicken. I usually go with chicken. The chicken comes in small chunks, almost like the ones you find in a chicken skewer. It's not dry and has similar garlicky BBQ flavour found in ClubHouse BBQ chicken seasoning. 

Greens n veggies: 100% there's an explosion of bean sprouts which adds a bit of crunchiness to your ramen experience, green onions, thin sliced red carrots, mushrooms, and black fungus. For those that like veggies with their ramen, this is your to-go ramen choice.

Soup: the menu says it's got chilli in it but I asked for a milder version of that to save my taste buds from jumping on fire. Temperature wise, the soup stayed warm all the way to my last bite of the meal. It really warmed me up on a cold day of -3 degrees. As someone mentioned in their food blog, this soup is \"worthy of gastronomic attention\". 

Ramen: Kenzo is famous for their wheat noodles. The noodles here are the thin ones that are great for slurping. It hits the spot when you're starving and cold!"}
{"text":"My fiance had never had \"real\" ramen before, so I knew we had to take advantage of the many options in Toronto. We went to the Kenzo Ramen on Bloor and were not disappointed.

I had the miso ramen ($9) and my fiance had the tonkotsu shoyu ramen ($13). The bowls were massive! My miso ramen was good, but his tonkotsu was way better; the broth was super flavorful. The pork in both bowls was super tender and fell apart as soon as you grabbed at it with your chopsticks. 

The service was great. We both used the washrooms twice--before and after eating--and unlike many shops in the area, they didn't complain about it. The host was also more than happy to explain to me how they made their tonkotsu broth when I asked. And when the waitress saw how much I struggle with chopsticks and slippery noodles, she immediately brought me a fork.

My only major complaint is that they leave both the outer and inner door of the shop open. I understand that it gets warm in the kitchen and they want to draw in customers, but we had to swat away several flies during our meal. Maybe they could leave just one of the doors open."}
{"text":"Not all Kenzo Ramen restaurants are the same. This is the best of all I've been to (the worse is on Queen West of Bathurst) while some are below average (such as the on Yonge and Sheppard). 

The texture of their noodles (although I've had better), this of all the Kenzo's I've been to is the best. Their soup base and garnishing are so superior to other locations. 

You can give out the ingredients. You can even give out the recipe. But you cannot teach a mediocre cook how to be a great chef."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant space at least 3 times, over the last 5 years, and each time it was a new establishment. 

Mmmm. Ramen. It's great on a cold winters night like the last. 

They don't have as much selection as Ajisen in terms of ramen flavours and appetizers, but they do have Takoyaki, which were quite decent! The other app is Gyoza. 

The service was quick and efficient. Although small, they had this huge area in the back where there were no tables. I found that odd, because they could fit made 5 more tables there. 

I got the Sapporo Miso , and it was really flavourful and full of veggies. It was supposed to have ground pork, but it was really sparse. I would recommend this to vegetarians and ask them to take out the meat. 
My mom had the TonKotsu, which looked yummy and a clean simple meal with an egg. I liked how the preserved egg wasn't fully cooked. (did they just take a regular egg and dye it?)

My complaint is that I think there was a lot of MSG in there. I can't be positive, but the dry mouth feeling lasted until the next morning. 

There is free parking after 6 for one hour on the street west of Walmer."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen was a pleasant surprise. On Bloor, near UofT, it was a convenient location. Hard to find parking though. It was busy, but still had room, no wait.

I got the Netsu Ramen. There was a mix of everything - ramen, vegetable and chicken. The portion was reasonable. But to be honest, whenever I eat ramen, it's never that filling. Everything was reasonably priced. 

The waitress was very friendly, explaining the spice levels, promptly refilling drinks and letting us chat."}
{"text":"SUPER FRIENDLY, YUMMY, NOODLE PLACE! I usually don't post but I truly believe this ramen place is better than the typical sansotei. The price is very fair for such a delicious broth. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! The servers are very kind and have a nice atmosphere that's not rushed and relaxing."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen chains. I always get the Tonkatsu, it's delicious and a decent portion for lunch. If you're hungry for dinner though, i'd order some of their dumplings - they're humungous for the price that they are (around $9) but very filling. A definite place to visit when you're around. They have several locations, one which is conveniently located around the corner from the Bay St Terminal."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time trying ramen at Kenzo in Toronto. This location is small but cozy. When we walked in we got a table right away and were given menu and water. I ordered the miso ramen with chicken and my friend had the yakisoba.

The service was fast and the waiter friendly. For the price the food is a great quality, the ramen was good and broth delicious. This is my favorite ramen outside of Japan  will return!"}
{"text":"Lets start with the good:

My friend and I received quick and friendly service even when there was only 1 waitress servicing the entire dining room (it started to fill up quite quickly around lunch time). The location is also very convenient; only a hop and skip away from Spadina subway. Portion sizes are generous, and the price is relatively low, especially when compared to other ramen joints around Toronto; I had the miso ramen ($7.95) and struggled to finish it. 

The bad:

The miso broth was weak; the depth in flavour wasn't there, and the broth itself was substantially less thick and rich than other places. The toppings that came with the dish were scarce; 2 small pieces of pork (shoulder) and a few thin slices of bamboo were all I could see."}
{"text":"Ramen is one of my go-to meals the day after a night of excess because it's homey and usually served fast (because on those days I usually wake up bleary-eyed and ravenously hungry for comfort food). My visit to Kenzo after one such night was definitely worthwhile. I'm a fan of ramen in shoyu-tonkotsu broth, which is a mix of pork and soy broths, and the version offered by Kenzo is definitely had the richness that I love about it -- not to mention umami up the ying-yang all up in my tastebuds. Delicious. The ramen itself was nicely cooked to al-dente. The only thing lacking in my meal was the skimpy portion of medium-cooked egg. Half an egg? Really? Boo. 

My dining companion and I also split an order of gyoza, which was greasy and maybe a little too heavy on the green onion... I'd skip that next time. But ramen-wise, Kenzo definitely fit the bill. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the broths for the ramen are delicious! Service was also quick. The only complaint that I have is that they should have more variety on their menu. Will definitely come back again in the near future."}
{"text":"Ate here twice over the Christmas school break, once by myself and once in a large group. On both occasions the service was very friendly and very fast, even though the restaurant was quite busy (mostly university students from the looks of things). Excellent in terms of quantity. I had the Tonkatsu ramen (great broth, tasty tender pork) and Shoyu ramen - think I like the Shoyu broth better. Also shared an order of Gyoza (large and tasty - very mild) and noticed a lot of tables ordering the chicken karaage."}
{"text":"Your average, rather small ramen store.  A fairly good selection of ramen and smaller appetizer dishes. Beware of the spice levels - they get spicy very, very quickly! They were accommodating and didn't put on any of the greens I had asked them not to.  

The soup/ramen tended to be more salty than I would have preferred but portions were fairly big! The ramen tended to be a bit stickier and the soup was thicker than usual, but overall - ok.

A plus with their take-out, they give you 2 separate bowls for ramen - one with the ramen and toppings, the other with the soup! A nice touch, considering the ramen would get drenched and soggy later on. But be careful - their take-out is slow (about 15 minutes) and not the best option, if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"SALTY... and the service was really BAD.

we walked in, the guy told us he wouldn't even be able to speak to us until all members of our group were arrived!
when we said all four of us were there, he told us to wait. 
he also commented that they don;t cut cakes (because i was carrying cake box, which we never intended to eat there...)

the food was good, but as noted, salty.
it was impossible to get refills on tes or drinks - they never came around aside from bringing the check after we had finished eating about 15 minutes before.

there are too many other good palces to go, where there is great service and the food is good.  
AVOID this hole."}
{"text":"The King of Kings (or \"King of the King\") is my favorite ramen dish to date. Spicy broth with a pile of tender roast pork, ground pork, medium-boiled egg, seaweed, etc. Absolutely amazing.

Staff are friendly amd efficient. Every time I've been the place is near or at capacity and they keep it moving like pros."}
{"text":"My review will be slightly different as my palate is limited to non-beef ramen dishes. 

So yesterday I came to Kenzo Ramen for the first time and wanted a vegetarian ramen soup. After a quick chit chat with the waitress, I ordered their go to vegetarian ramen dish in a creamy soya based broth topped with tofu, mushrooms, bokchoy, sliced cabbage, and pink ginger pieces. The soup arrived shortly after and gave off a warm and comforting feeling. The ramen looked as expected however I was expecting a bit more mushrooms but that's fine. The noodles were slightly al dente and perfect for a hot broth. The broth itself however was not my favourite part about this dish. It was quite salty and perhaps too creamy. I was expecting a miso like flavour but it was more creamy of a taste. That's fine, the dish is titled as creamy, so I guess I should have expected that. Overall it was a filling dish and I'm glad they had a vegetarian option."}
{"text":"Really, really tasty.  The sake was great (hot enough that you need to hold it by the little towel they wrapped around it) and they delivered on their promise: that they were a noodle house.  

I got the Yakisoba, which was a totally fun presentation (sizzling on a skillet) and L got the *chan Ramen.  I forget the full name (hence the *), but at about $9, it was one of the pricier ramen options.  In other words: prices are totally reasonable.

Truth is, I might go back tonight.  Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Came here 3x, had 3 diff ramens: Tonkatsu, a miso ramen, and another which I don't remember.

Taste: I love ramen, and I really enjoyed it. Flavored well, and when you are craving ramen, it really hits the spot.

Portions: While it won't leave you hungry, it's not very generous, either. i'm sure it'll fill girls up, but for a dude like me, I tend to get hungry again in a few hours after Kenzo's ramen.

Price: As others have mentioned, the cost is rather high for ramen, esp for the smallish portions.

Mention: Even though this is a Japanese chain, I think the servers are Korean... Not that it matters all that much, I guess, but just a FYI."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen in a lovely setting, with quick service to boot! 

The Ji Su Men really hit the spot. The \"broth\" was more like chicken corn soup, but it made for a flavorful base. 

The takoyaki was so. good. I order some every time I go to a Japanese place, yet have never been happy with the results. I figured I had unrealistic expectations of what takoyaki should be, and maybe I do, but this hit every mark for me."}
{"text":"This is my comfort food in Winters. Go there on a freezing night and I promise the food will warm you up. The Flavours are distinct and appeal to my tastebuds. It is very satisfying and good value for money."}
{"text":"I got the tonkatzu don for takeout. The portion is tiny and the tonkatzu was so dry. Not worth the money"}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN IVE EVER HAD. (and Ive tried A LOT of ramen places).

I dont live in Toronto, but when I went to Toronto to work for 6 weeks in the summer, I wanted to come here anytime I was in the area. 

I always ordered their pork broth with level 3 spicy. The broth is what makes it -- its amazing!! The noodles are always cooked right, the egg isnt too overdone, and the pork is soft and flavorful. Every single ingredient put into this dish is just done perfectly. 

I've been to the location on Yonge, and for some reason, it just didnt taste as good.

Give this place a try, its SO good! Definitely coming here again the next time I go to Toronto."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for good, or even decent ramen, do not come here. Thin, watery, tasteless soup and mushy noodles. If I could give zero stars, I would. Not sure how this place has such a high rating considering how bad the food is here. Also not sure how this place is still open given that there are many other better ramen places nearby. Avoid."}
{"text":"Walked in off the street one day as i was looking for a Ramen place in the area. It was fairly busy, looked clean, and inviting. There were 4 vegeterian options on the menu and i chose the Vegeterian Creamy Ramen  and crossed my fingers.

I was seated and served fairly quickly. The server was friendly. The Ramen was perfect temperature, very flavorful, and had great texture. It was exactly what i was looking for. The Matcha iced tea also complemented it very well."}
{"text":"Kenzo is one of my fav chain food places. Quality is consistent from one to an another place. This location similarly had fantastic Netsu Ramen, the gyoza as always is top notch. I will admit I had the chance to sample some veg options, I must say the fried tofu and creamy ramen veg was actually pretty good! Oh and the Macha Latte was absolutely amazing! 

No point adding more images to the exact same ones that are here already! But it looked just as good as it tasted. Great service and super friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little ramen place. I love to come here after catching a film at Bloor Theatre. 

Although this restaurant is small, it has a lot to offer. The ambience is great whether you're there on a date, with friends, or for business. The service is friendly and fast. The menu is on the simplistic side which is good on the tradition and efficiency side, but bad on the I've already tried everything on the menu side and wanna try something new sometimes. Prices are decent, not cheap, but not expensive either.

Overall, a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night after being in the area for an appointment.

I ordered the yakisoba and companion ordered sho-yu ramen. We also ordered gyoza (dumplings). The sho-yu ramen was okay, but then again, I'm not the world's biggest ramen fan. The yakisoba was great! Full of veggies, it's a generous portion and it's delicious. I was really impressed with the gyoza. Stuffed with yummy spiced pork and fried to perfection. I hate going to restos that use the frozen crap, but the goods at Kenzo seem to be made from scratch.

Cheap and delish.
Just the way I like it. 

Yay, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. I actually didn't realize before i went in that all they have is ramen. with that tonkatsu pork thrown in. some chicken. I went in thinking it was a general japanase soups place. udon. soba. etc. ramen is my least favourite kind of noodle. reminds me of mr. noodle cups.

well, the food was alright, but the soups they serve would not have been my picks. not a big fan of fried things being thrown in soups. something about that just doesn't work. something fried should be crispy.

anyway, that said, this is a neighbourhood place for me, so if i was really hungry and was sick of eating shawarma on that particular day, i might stumble in again."}
{"text":"Kenzo Ramen is a small restaurant that seats about 30. Most tables are for 2 people (although they do have accommodation for larger groups). There is a bit of Japanese decor on the walls and the tables are metal but provide decent seating. There are usually a small number of staff on hand but the restaurant always runs quickly and smoothly, even when it is packed to the brim with a line out the front door.

I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen ($10.95) when I was there last Sunday. The other time I visited I got the same but with double toppings (an extra $3 charge). Neither the noodles nor the garnish/toppings were anything special- more or less standard ramen noodles.

The broth was excellent. It was a creamy sweet and slightly salty pork bone broth. I usually don't finish the broth when I go out for ramen but this was certainly an exception.

The service is impeccably fast. I got my food and drink (matcha iced latte, $3.95) within four minutes of ordering each.

Kenzo lacks in its small variety of menu options, coupled with OK noodles and expensive matcha drinks. What you gain in fast service you lose in menu options and quality."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! 

I remember walking in several months back and then walking out. The good as intrigue me but I don't know what they are... are they dumplings?

I'm kinda not impressed with their modern design but I understand the need for businesses to have an up-to-date-with-the-times atmosphere. It looks like a cafeteria style to me, which indicates to me; eat, pay and move on.

I tried their vegetarian ramen. Incredibly flavorful! I liked that it was enough for two sittings and when it got packed up and then I went back to it, it tasted like my favourite dish from a restaurant downtown that closed down a couple years ago.

In essence, this soup was nostalgic and all the good kind. 

I do enjoy trying new things and this ramen had a specific kind of mushroom in it... I think it was mushroom. It could have been something similar to seaweed. Either way, the texture in my mouth was slimy. Weird description of food that is meant to be appetizing. But it was very tasty. Especially as a pairing with the entirety of the soup, which was over all good.

I love the eggs they put in Ramen. I was introduced to it, while in New York and I never would've thought to put egg in soup like that, hard boiled but they have a special process in its preparation that works as an integral part of ramen. In my books anyway. Here, to me it's a bit pricey... $.80 for half an egg. Eesh! I get it... soft boiled then marinated in their sauce to make it taste the way it does... dual process. Equals twice as much money to pay. 

In conclusion, when I am feeling under the weather, ramen is my new go to... at least if I feel I can stomach the complexity of having many ingredients at a time. Otherwise, still chicken noodle soup: simple. 

I would definitely venture here again!"}
{"text":"Very quick service! The ramen we ordered came out within 10 min of us ordering. The service was really good, aside from the waiters coming back to us every 20 min asking us if we were done our food, even though there was still ramen in the bowl."}
{"text":"We got into the venue as soon as it opened cause we were headed to the pride parade after. It was empty and we were the firsts the waitress was very nice, friendly, accommodating, and quick. We got our food within 10 mins of ordering. Everything was hot and our waters were always full.

I ordered the king of kings bowl which was huge and consisted of pork, ground pork, bamboo shoots, fresh seaweed, dried seaweed, bean sprouts and so much more. Overall, it was an amazing bowl. The flavor though not strong definitely hit the spot. It was also suppose to be spicy but for my palate I would say it only reached maybe a 3-4 out of 10. (I can tolerate quite a lot of spice)

They unfortunately lacked a diverse dessert menu, but in the end, everything was pleasing. The bowl I got which was their biggest was only about $13. The other bowls ranged from $10-12. Definitely happy with my decision to try this place out."}
{"text":"Owned by Koreans.
Usually pretty busy, prepare to wait during dinner hours
Servers are helpful and fill water immediately
Somewhat pricey considering the portion sides
Green tea drinks are pretty awful
Good for lunch or a quick dinner"}
{"text":"I've gone there before and the food was always decent. However I ordered gyoza that came not fully cooked, like the pork was reddish pink. I sent it back and the server comes back to tell me their cook said they had cooked it enough and that was what it was supposed to look like. She asked me if I wanted new gyoza or the ones I had sent back. By then I just wanted to leave and not have to explain why cooked pork shouldn't be pink. I cut open into the other gyoza and they were also not cooked through. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Perfect broth, great depth of abundant flavors. Ramen was a nice chewy crisp consistency. I will be craving more during long cold winter nights. Must try gyoza! Plump lil' suckers with lots of meat and flavors."}
{"text":"Popped in here for lunch and enjoyed it. Had the Tonkotsu ramen - the broth was tasty, the veggies were fresh, and the pork was good. The serving size of noodles was a bit on the small size, but I found it perfect for lunch. Our server was attentive and really nice. All in all, an enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered the netsu ramen with pork and the gyoza.  The broth was very tasty, not too spicy and piping hot!! I came in with a group of 6 people and was very impressed by how fast the service was. Huge portions, tasty, and inexpensive - perfect ramen :)"}
{"text":"I've ordered food from Kenzo a few times now and each time I absolutely LOVED my meal. They make great ramen and they make it quickly if you're short on time. Definitely one of my go-to places!"}
{"text":"Popped in here after finishing all my Xmas shopping last night. 

Decor is ok - clean, modern and chic but kinda cheap. Just like Ikea. But Kenzo in in the Annex, so this is the best that can be expected.

Service was fast and they definitely had a good  number of staff on hand.

I did get very anxious waiting for my food. Everyone's food appeared to be coming out fast except mine. Grrrr. I watched as 2 patrons who ordered AFTER me were given their food while I still waited. My rage was building, fueled by \"the Little Drummer Boy\" being pumped out too loudly on the radio.

Netsu ramen ($8.95) finally arrived and saved this review from being a 2 star. Food was GOOD. Netsu is one of the hot/spicy ramens. They served it reasonably spicy without me needing to specify, bonus points to them. Nice presentation here.The  Netsu was loaded with veggies, plus a few oz of ground chicken. Chicken was nicely flavoured with a hint of ginger."}
{"text":"After coming here, I have decided that as long as i have a means to get to this location as opposed to the one at Dundas, i'd pick the Bloor one for sure. Why? Because this place doesn't require you to stand outside in the cold as you wait for seats. This place is more modern, it's bigger, and the food is the same as the Dundas location. Had the Netsu Ramen and I have nothing to complain about. I love it.  

If you need to choose between Dundas and Bloor, seriously, pick Bloor. Okay so the Dundas one looks more japanese and less modern, but is it really worth the cold wait outside? Nah."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I've only had restaurant ramen once in my life, although the idea of going out for ramen really appeals to my Asian heritage. Admittedly, I love to eat those packages of instant noodles you can get for dirt cheap at the grocery store every once in a while. Especially when it's raining. So, on a particularly gloomy Sunday afternoon, I decided to go out for ramen at Kenzo after discovering that they offer several different vegetarian options (!!!).

I waffled a bit but eventually settled on the Ji Su Men. The picture on the menu is highly deceptive, as I thought the broth would be spicy and rich. Instead, it was really pale and thick and all I could taste was sesame oil. The noodles to bean sprouts ratio was literally 1:1, if not 2:1 in favour of the bean sprouts. Also, lots of people seem to complain about the use of MSG here...I thought MSG was used to make food taste good?!? Mine sure didn't, but I still suffered the feeling of general malaise that occurs after consuming the dreadful monosodium glutamate. 

For $10.95 a bowl, I was pretty disappointed, and hate to think of all the other cheap but delicious meals I could have had for that price instead. Next time it's raining...I'm getting veggie pho."}
{"text":"The ramen here is pretty good, but the portions can be small for the regular size. The broth isn't too salty which I sometimes find can be an issue with ramen. I wish the eggs were seasoned more and the option for thick noodles was available, but you can't always get what you want. I'd still come back if I was in the area as the location is super convenient if you're studying at UofT."}
{"text":"Kenzo Japanese Noodle House opened a new location in the Annex. 

The decoration is more chic and modern compared to their Dundas Street location which is more traditional Japanese. Bright lighting and a lot more spacious.... 

The service is fast and friendly. Seems like there are more waitstaffs working and we were here for an early pre dinner snack so we were seated quickly and served immediately! 

We ordered the Miso Ramen ($6.95) and Tonkotsu Ramen ($8.95). Their machine for Tacoyaki not working that day, would like to try that. 

Tonkotsu broth is really rich, milky in colour and with tons of \"porky\" flavours.. We both prefer that to the Miso Ramen.. The Miso Ramen is of dark miso based just lack some complexity to the broth.... 

Noodle was nicely cooked... a little chewy with a lot of texture... Slurp Slurp Slurp! 

I have to make a note about the Chasu, after eating at all 3 Kenzo Ramen locations.. I have to say the one up at North York is the best! Here the chasu is cut really thin, a little dry... and they don't have that little smokey flavour since they did not grilled them before serving.... 

Here also they don't have the set menu (basic Ramen+3 gyoza) like what they offer up at North York. Green Tea is $1 charge. 

I am glad that there are more and more Ramen restaurants in TO! If you are in the area, it is great to have a steamy hot Ramen on a chilly winter day! 

They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Had scoped this place a week earlier on my way to Koreatown, but had just finished mowing down bulgogi for 2 at Nak Won in Chinatown. Fast Forward 1 week - cold dreary Saturday and guess what, I got a fever and the only cure is Ramen! or was that more cowbell? 

Well Kenzo Ramen didn't disappoint. I have to admit after 7 years living in Tokyo, Japan, my expectations were low, but Kenzo Ramen delivered a great Tonkotsu Ramen to myself and an excellent Netsu Ramen to my fiancee that is on par with \"good\" Ramen shops in Tokyo. (Now don't go f-ing ballistic on me after and say I said it was the best, it isn't crack - I said it was \"good\". Now if you are in the mood for some crack-type addicting Ramen, you need to hit a place in Tameikesanno in Tokyo, Japan just outside the exit (email for the location if need be) - but be forewarned that this ain't no run of the mill Ramen.... 

Now on the downside of Kenzo - the seating is a bit too close for comfort as some people have mentioned. Further, due to the popularity of Kenzo, people tend to wait, but there is essentially no waiting area, so they hover just behind you with anticipation... So come here for the Ramen and move your party elsewhere for conversation!"}
{"text":"Tried most of their ramen because we usually order here for lunch at work when we're in the mood and I love all of their ramen especially king of kings. I am not a big eater but I can definitely finish the entire bowl of ramen. Their matcha smoothie is not exactly how I want it to be though but nevertheless, it's  still one of the best ramens in toronto."}
{"text":"The food here actually only deserves 2 1/2 stars; the other 1/2 is for the prompt, if bare-bones, service and the overall feel of the restaurant.

I had a tonkotsu ramen, and this is how it went down:

The broth was a bit bland, but still good, but  the noodles were a bit too soft and not chewy like they're supposed to be. The four slices of pork, on the other hand,  were deliciously flavoured if a bit less tender than I would've liked; the half-egg was also very tasty and boiled just right. However, there was waaay too much veggie garnish. There were so many beansprouts that it kind of felt like there was a 2:3 ratio between them and the noodles, and  the small pile of green onions totally overwhelmed the broth (I ended up picking them all out). 

Finally,  the portions were kind of on the small side, especially for the price 

All in all, just a very okay ramen place. Nothing special, but a good place to go when it's cold, I guess. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to several Kenzo Ramen places but this one is clearly the best. Service is fast, quality is great. I can recommend this place to just about everyone."}
{"text":"I ordered the Netsu Ramen, which has a spicy red soup base topped with gound meat and veggies.  I really love the spicy and smokey soup. You could order it mild, medium or spicy, but I wasn't asked when I ordered it, however it came spicy and was the perfect amount of heat.

Service was good and the food came quickly.
I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Decent ramen shop, inexpensive, and will certainly satisfy your noodle soup cravings, but there are better to be had in Toronto. Their tonkatsu ramen and shio ramen broths are okay but not as good as Santouka's ,which have a deeper and richer flavor. Kenzo's version tastes thinner and more watered down. Noodles are also fine, but IMO are also lesser quality, being less springy.  The roast pork isn't as luscious and soft as the other place's pork, but was still  good.  However, I liked the addition of crisp fresh bean sprouts as a counterpoint to the softer-textured items.  A plus is that they offer a vegetarian ramen with a true vegetable-based broth - but while a welcome option for non-meat eaters, it still lacked umami and a fuller fat feel. Kenzo's iced matcha green tea was very good and refreshing."}
{"text":"3.5 stars and rounded up. I was craving some ramen today and noticed that many of the other places with higher Yelp reviews don't offer vegetarian options and/or are farther from the subway.

I ended up ordering the vegetarian version of the Ji Su Men (A soy sauce base soup combined with eggs and sesame oil. Mixed with stir fried vegetables.) I found the portion size to be very large and the meal really quite satisfying. I wish I could of had some tofu in there, but my waitress said that unfortunately they could not add any to my dish. 

I also ordered a hot green tea for $1 that was served way too hot and with the tea bag still in the cup. It was too hot to drink during the meal (or even to touch the cup), but I was able to enjoy it after I finished eating once the tea had cooled down to a more reasonable temperature.

The prices are also affordable and the service is friendly and efficient. Would recommend if you are already in the area and looking for some ramen."}
{"text":"I went there Friday evening, the service was speedy but the a/c blowing right above my head was uncomfortable. 
I ordered the Raman with pork slices for $7.95 plus tax 
the soup was tasty, but they only gave two flimsy pieces of pork 
I asked for no bamboo shoots 
the ramen was good 
but portion was small."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's really fair to give a review while I have a cold, but here it is anyway. 

I came here with two friends and ordered the tonkotsu ramen. It came relatively quickly and was pretty average for ramen. The noodles were nice and chewy. Unfortunately, I was also sick and had trouble tasting the food, so the validity of this review is based off what I could taste and what my friends could tell me. The two of them ordered the tonkotsu miso ramen and a plate of gyoza to share. While the gyoza was good, I don't know if I'd pay to eat what is actually basic dumplings. The price paid for everything was reasonable and within the same range as other ramen shops I've visited. 

Our server was quite friendly and efficient. When we first entered, he didn't notice us, so we had to seat ourselves. Once we did though, he hurried to accommodate us. No complaints about him. 

I didn't really have any negative experiences at this restaurant, but there wasn't really anything good enough about it to warrant a higher rating. I wish Yelp would implement half stars, because Kenzo truly sits at a 3.5 for me. A little above average, but I don't know if I'd come again."}
{"text":"Ramen delight!  I read a few Yelpers' reviews of Kenzo at lunch, and could not get the idea of 'ramen' out of my mind!  

Tonight, I experienced Kenzo for the first time.  How sweet, my masculine friend and I were happily welcomed with an \"Irrashaimase\" (Japanese for welcome), and prompt service.  We were able to sit down immediately this Friday night.  We ordered our meal and within minutes (was I dreaming), the ramen was served!!!  Where but McD's and other fast food joints could food arrive this fast?

I ordered the veg version of the Sapporo ramen.  Not sure if there was any MSG about but appreciated the soup base after reading yelper Eliah H's phrase: \"the recipes for the soup stock are closely guarded secrets from one Ramen house to the next.\"  There was another yelper's review, where she typed about their yakisoba coming with tons of veggies.  Almost ordered that, but HAD to try their soup stock this time round!

Kenzo's is prob the only place where veggie dishes outprice the non-veggie ones, go figure.  I agree with jocelyn I, \"Ramen was a little pricy for what it is\".  If their veg dishes were $7.95 or $8.95, that would have been better, more reasonable IMO.  But as an occasional treat - this place does the trick!

All in all, a good eating experience with nice service... and pretty good non-instant ramen noodles*.  And yes, the soup stock... was tasty  :)

You may, someday, want to consider a DIY ramen.
1. Purchase fresh plain ramen from Sanko's freezer section
http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sanko-trading-toronto;
2. Use MISO paste as your soup base;
3. pick up some Chinese Cabbage; bean sprouts; water cress; etc... so that you can blanch or boil some veggies into the bottom of your ramen bowl.  (Optional) Add kimchi for extra flavouring, and/or Sriracha hot sauce for some heat.  

Or, just head out for some ramen!!"}
