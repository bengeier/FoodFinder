{"text":"I Don't Always Eat Pizza, but when I do I prefer Pony Express. Don't stay hungry my friends eat pizza, chicken or an italian sub. And the jojo's are always fantastic. Ã¨ una bella pizzeria."}
{"text":"Walked in to pick up my pizza, inspected it before leaving.... and my pizza had a visible hair in it. I got mushroom with half pepperoni but less than half the slices had pepperoni on them. The kitchen looked dirty and unhygienic. They did void my purchase but dine at your own risk."}
{"text":"Great JoJo's and I recommend you get a large, double cheese. Classic pizza carry out that has been beloved for many years. Local joint and not a chain!!! Delivery is usually around 45 min and still hot."}
{"text":"Terrible i would love to talk to the owner.The worst customer service from the manager,now my family is upset i wont go back.and we purchase almost every week .I am letting people know."}
{"text":"Great pizza and JoJos. The JoJos taste as though they are breaded, then baked, then flash fried...so good. Fast and friendly delivery, and again, wonderful pizza."}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered a sub. The young lady said 10-15 min. Went in about 12 min later sub not even placed in oven yet to be heated. Which no big deal only takes a few minutes to heat up anyways. Problem is she cut up the tomatoes on a dirty counter and when I had mentioned it she said it's not dirty I just bleached it the counter is stained. I told her I can see dirt from the bottom of the pizza pan from here. She began to cut up another tomato and I told her why would you cut up a new batch on the same dirty counter I don't want those on my sandwich your counter is dirty.  Finally she did it right a got something clean to cut it up on. Attitude the whole time. My advice to her, don't try a bs someone you don't know. I was in that business for years ran two pizza shops for two different companies at the same time because I know the business. If you need a lesson on how to clean in a food service company I'd come and show you for free. If you wipe down your counter after completing a round of orders your counter wouldn't be stained like that. Second your counter wasn't stained and you didn't just bleach it. Also never tell a customer you just but food on something that could still have the possibility of bleach on it."}
{"text":"One of the best! An authentic family owned pizza shop with more than just pizza. Fried chicken and JoJos, AWESOME! They have a unique way of doing sausage on a pizza, crumbled and spread evenly through out that taste remarkable.  One of my favorites to get pizza and definitely worth the extra money, than paying for one of those inexpensive franchise pizza places."}
{"text":"this place has good wings for a great price and they have good fried chicken! prices are pretty good I would recommend this place just for the wings because I thought they were awesome!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good, and love that they have a small size option. Wings are decent as well. Have had problems calling in and placing an order on busier nights."}
{"text":"Good pizza, flavorful sauce, good toppings.  The heft of the pizzas was a bit on the light side, but the toppings and such were certainly adequate. Would return for sure."}
{"text":"A neighbor helped with a flat tire so I said would get him pizza tonight. Had a bogo for a medium pizza.  Picked up a cheese. And then sausage and pepperoni and meatball. And side salad with cheese and Italian dressing.  The sauce on pizza is sweet and appears to be a cheese blend of provolone and mozzarella. The girl at the counter was really friendly and helpful   the medium has 8 slices so enough for 3 meals."}
