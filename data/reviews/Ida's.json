{"text":"Love Ida's! First visit to new place since fire destroyed the older restaurant, and the food is as good as I remembered from before. If she has time, Ida still comes out and talks with her customers - nice touch! Service is excellent! Does NOT accept credit or debit cards, so don't forget to bring cash. Great food, and lots of it, at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, however not a fan of it being heated in a Styrofoam container in the microwave for my takeout order.  No thanks,  I'll put it on a glass plate and heat it up when I get home."}
{"text":"AMAZING, authentic Italian food.  Ida is super sweet and swears like a sailor.  I had the lasagna and ate the WHOLE THING which is rare for me.  It was a fun, delicious dining experience.  She doesn't have a lot of room so I suggest calling ahead for a seat."}
