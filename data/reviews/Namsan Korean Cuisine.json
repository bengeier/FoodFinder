{"text":"A warm little restaurant. Staff is friendly and food is good. We had chicken rice, seafood pancake and should. Taste good."}
{"text":"Very nice dining experience. Friendly stuff, family run with a warm environment. Nothing on the menu was gluten free, but stuff was more than accommodating and made me a wonderful beef broth with fresh vegetables. One of the best soups I had in a long time!"}
{"text":"Namsan is close to the end of downtown in a house. This place is awesome for food and beer and opens late as well. When you enter there are seating on the main floor but there are additional seating upstairs.  Today was a hot day so we ordered cold noodles and we all felt hungry, so we ordered the cheese dak-galbi. Happy everyone at the table could eat spicy!   The cold noodle was good! it had a good balance of sweet, sour, and spice. On a hot day it was perfect! The cheese dak-galbi came out on a huge cast pan! it took more than half of the table and it was placed on top of a burner for additional heat. Each scope had sweet potato, chicken, korean rice cake, onion, cheese, and spicy sauce! It was very delicious! You could order this without the cheese but! the cheese made this dish soooo much better! When you finish the dish to about 70-80%, they will come out with rice and a mixture of egg, seaweed, and sauce, they will mix it for you (almost like fried rice) let it sit and heat up for a bit before you eat. The mixture was even better with 'fried rice style'. I was happy to see how this one dish turned to be two dishes.   Definitely will come back for fried chicken! heard it was also very good!"}
