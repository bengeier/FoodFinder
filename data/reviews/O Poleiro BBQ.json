{"text":"Visited again this weekend and had a great meal. I tried the breaded fish with potatoes and rice and it was fantastic. My wife had a chicken sandwich and we shared some fries. The potatoes and the fries are seasoned and very flavourful. The rice is bland on its own, but add the hot sauce and it comes alive."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese in town! Tony's the best!   Awesome fries, chicken and rice... Fair prices! Great party pack options for big groups (usually serves way more food then intended)- friendly service always! Be sure to call in ahead to place order to avoid a wait time."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken, the sauce... Mmmmm. Get the family meal for $25 - so much food!! Leftovers for days! The rice and potatoes are awesome too."}
{"text":"This is the worst portuguese I have ever had. It's the only option for portuguese miles around and i have tried it a couple times now.  Chicken is tasteless. Piri piri and spices are nowhere to be found. Potatoes watery, rice just bad.  Oh, and if you want something you better phone ahead...the chance of walking in and getting something is rare."}
{"text":"Delicious fries and round potatoes very tasty . Wish they had a grill to grill the chicken instead of rotisserie , but still awesome food !"}
{"text":"Running late ? No time to make dinner ? Hmm .....Frozen Tv dinner ? Don't do that to your family ! Get them something they will enjoy !  Call Tony from O polerieo and pick up a hot delicious ready made whole chicken for $14.00. Go home make some simple side dishes and you've just created a delicious meal you and your family can enjoy."}
{"text":"What's with the Portuguese and their delicious chicken?  They are number 1 in the dept. - better than they can hope for in the Euro Cup hahaha. It's all good here.  I like the fries but not the round potatoes. They're still good but a little bland (not their fault that's just the way those little round potatoes are!). Friendly crazy service (they're usually pretty busy), they make me laugh every time.  I've eaten here at least 10 times since they opened a couple years ago but never left a review. It was about time - gems like this deserve recognition."}
{"text":"Confusing place..... pretty sure the people who work there are confused as well.... When the food is cooked properly, it's great. Unfortunately it's only a 50% chance of that. Been here a bunch of times, and when I go in, it's a crap shoot... half the time Chicken is not ready to serve, the other half it's either perfect of really over cooked. Even when over cooked I love the flavor. I would come here a few times a week if I knew I was getting properly cooked food. The way it's run now, I go there maybe once a month.  I really want to give a great rating, but I can't. The inconsistency keeps me away."}
{"text":"Wow.  Quite possibly the worst meal I have had in my life.  Definitely the worst potuguese chicken I've ever had.   Where to start.  Chicken tasteless despite asking for spicy, no seasoning present whatsoever.  Potatoes weren't even cooked properly, I've never been served uncooked potatoes ever.  Salad no dressing.  No piri piri with chicken.  Hard skip guys. Don't fall for the litany of reviewers with less than 10 total reviews I actually walked to the garbage can and threw out more than half of this travesty.  I can't believe it was this bad."}
{"text":"So we have returned however success seems to have resulted in taking customers for granted.   The offering of \"dine in\" now means you may, often may not, order the signature feature CHICKEN.   I don't know about you but businesses that pay more attention to those in the drive through, or in this case, those that order out over the phone, chaps my ass.   I love the chicken and love the fries but I won't ever make an effort to dine in again."}
{"text":"New to here but don't underestimate the fries... They are not plain, they have an amazing seasoning on them! Had a whole chicken, to myself.... i'm a pig.... whatever, it was GREAT, I could not resist!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Bradford only because we were nowhere near home at dinnertime.  And what a stumble it was.    We both ordered a quarter chicken dinner, dark meat.  BF had spicy flavoured chicken, with rice and Caesar salad as sides, and I had mild flavoured chicken, with potato and garden salad as sides.  Both versions of chicken were delicious.  They were both salty and juicy.  The skin was slightly charred to give a hint of \"cooked by fire\" taste.  The spicy chicken wasn't that spicy.  The spiciness was in the aftertaste.  We were given a little cup of sauce, which I supposed was piri piri, for additional flavouring.  Both salads were fresh.  The portion of the rice and potato was substantial.  The potato had a fancy name called Parisian potatoes.  Don't be fooled.  They were regular home-styled potatoes in sauce.  I don't know the market rate for Portuguese chicken, nor can I tell whether it is authentic Portuguese cooking.  I could, however, attest that the quarter chicken dinner is a hair cheaper than Swiss Chalet's.  Services was super friendly.  The owner/manager treated us as if we were regulars.  What more can I ask from a small neighbourhood shop that offers cheap and good food, reasonable portion and super-friendliness? So I hand out five little red stars.  The store was under renovation to add a dining area in the unit next door when we patronized.  I assumed we paid the pricing of a take out joint.  It might go up when the dining area is fully renovated.  Visit now to get it cheap."}
{"text":"The chicken is very tasty and the potatoes are very good. May kids love their fries.... They're amazing. The staff is very friendly and and attentive. It feels like home. The owner is a great guy"}
{"text":"Went there with the family for the first time. Small place not fancy but good bbq chicken and portuggese food. The owner is very nice and friendly. Very accommodating to make sure your happy. The food is excellent but just a touch salty for my taste but maybe thats why the food taste so good! Its unfortunate this place is so far from where I live or I'd be here every week!"}
