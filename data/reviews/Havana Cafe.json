{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant gave me this East coast feel, I felt right at home when I ordered the chicken with rice and plantanos...I was full. Their portions are generous and love the fact that they were very attentive to our needs. The music in the background is cultural, love Havana's and I am sure to come back with some friends."}
{"text":"I just love Havana Café, it is quiet and charming place for lunch and dinner.  BJ, is an wonderful person and her cooking is amazing.  This is an authentic Caribbean cousine and it like being in the islands.  Love the empanadas and Cuban pork sandwiches."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation over New Years. The food was delicious. Tons of vegetarian options. Yam soup, lentil stuffed chillies, plantains and black bean dip. A week later and I'm still salivating over the lentil stuffed pepper. The covered outdoor patio with a fireplace adds a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Had lunch and was quite disappointed. Ordered the Emparedado de Pollo which is described as poached chicken breast on a Cuban roll. The roll was great as were the avocado slices BUT  I found only a very thin slice of chicken with very little taste but it did say poached. It did not say it was a thin slice of deli chicken! The fries were OK although definitely not homemade. Eventually the waiter asked if everything tasted good and I asked \"where is the chicken\" so he immediately turned and walked away making no comment of any sort. For $10 I do think I was ripped off. Needless to say I will not return  again.
I should say I was here about a year ago and everything was fine then. Do not remember what I ordered."}
{"text":"I'd been craving Cuban food ever since I left Florida, and I couldn't have been more thrilled after our meal at Havana Cafe.  I wouldn't sit inside, as the atmosphere kind of sucks, but the patio was great in the recently-awesome weather.  The service was great... the waiter knew the menu inside and out, had great recommendations, and was the guy who remembers your order without a pad and somehow doesn't screw it up.

Sangria-Delicious
Mojitos-Same
Seviche (spelled that way) -Ditto
Gambas y Pollo-See Above
Pumpkin Soup (seasonal)-Best I've Had

The bad - I think they are pretty over-priced for Cuban food.  Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but I don't think Cuban food should fall in the $20/plate range.  You need a key to get into the restrooms, which makes it feel kind of like a gas station.  You also get a feel that most male customers just go behind the dumpsters, not that I did that...  

This place would have been an easy 5-stars except for one thing, that totally blew the experience.  The waiter automatically added a 20% tip to the bill, on top of tax.  Ordinarily he would have earned it.  But when questioned, he said they always do that on large parties.  We were a party of 5.  He was extremely arrogant about it, saying nobody's ever questioned it.  Totally ruined the whole evening.  And of course, there was no mention of an auto-tip on the menu, go figure.  I could understand if there were 10 of us, you get it.

Overall, I would be excited to go back again.  It's a great place to go if you are craving some pretty good authentic food in the valley that isn't Mexican.  Grab a $28 pitcher of sangria and/or a few mojitos, splurge on some appetizers, and go for just about anything on the menu.  Nobody in our group left disappointed, with the food at least."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service. Loved the mohitos...just like in Cuba.  And the Ropa Vieja is excellent."}
{"text":"Yum! Friendly staff. Food is wonderful. If you want to try Cuban for the first time. Go here. Mojiotos are great as well.  We go every other month or so.. Easy to droop a few bucks here though. But, life is short..eat well.
We were crushed when we found out they closed up. What a loss!!! I hope BJ opens a new place or gives her recipes to someone..  Until then,, we wait.."}
{"text":"This place is racist!  If there are any Cuban or 100% hispanic families, they will be served before you and you might not even get served!

    I made a reservation for five people at 6:30PM (July 16, 2014) since my wife is Dominican (Cuban food is similar to Dominican food) and it was my dad's birthday. 

 Anyway, we got there at the same time 2 other hispanic families did at 6:30.   We were shown to our table in the corner of the restaurant and then we were ignored for the rest of the night! 

  7:00PM, no waiter to be seen anywhere. I politely walked over to the wait staff station and told them we were ready to order food. 

7:20PM-  After almost an hour, we were able to place our order.

 8:00PM the two hispanic families paid their bill and left after eating!  Meanwhile we still hadn't even gotten any of our food!

   When we asked the wait staff, all they said was, \"WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER YOUR FOOD WILL TAKE, YOU CAN LEAVE IF YOU WANT!\"

   Obviously, they didn't want us to be there and they didn't want our business!!!

    I can't prove it was racism but that is what it certainly seemed like. We were all dressed nice and only talked quietly while sitting at our table.   My wife is 9 months pregnant too and they left her there hungry while the other families ate! Of course, the staff never mentioned anything about my dad's birthday. They didn't care.

  And to top it all off at the end, the bill we got was for all the food we ordered and never got!!!  My dad's friend said he didn't want to pay for food he never got (and probably wasn't even cooked yet)  They corrected our bill; we paid for our drinks and left at 8:15.   Then we went to Arbys for dinner."}
{"text":"We went the last time there was a Groupon,  and found the food horrible. The place looks tired, the portions are very small. Even with the Groupon the cost of one appetizer was $18.00 and the portion not only small, but pitiful in taste. We would recommend Millies cafe in Mesa which has excellent PUerto Rican food which is similar to Havana, however, the taste and freshness you will enjoy. Stay away from this garbage dump. The service liked the food was garbage."}
{"text":"I just left the Havana Cafe and to say the least we were very disappointed. I have been to the Cafe months ago and enjoyed my meal immensely. I must say to be served the same 18.00 entree tonight half the size on a salad plate was a shock. 
On the appetizer side to be served four bacon wrapped dates served on a little plate with
a dollie was a joke. It is a shame that a restaurant we visited and enjoyed just months
ago could change for the worse so quickly."}
{"text":"My family and I loved the service and food!! How I've missed a good Cuban meal... My favorite was the Arroz con Pollo!!! Next time we go to Arizona we are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and delicious mojitos! Atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. Food so good and authentic that I felt like I was back in San Juan. I will most definitely be back and I'm telling everyone I know."}
{"text":"Were do we start? My reservation was made for 8:15 pm. which we were there on time for. We were told to wait outside which we did. After almost half an hour, we decided to ask what was taking so long and realized that they had forgotten about us. When I went to enquired what was taking so long, I spoke to the owner which to my surprised WASN'T even CUBAN, which should have been an indicator as to what was to come:

-Although the food wasn't bad, it is NOT AUTHENTIC CUBAN FOOD.
-The black beens had some vinegary-spicy ingredient 
 -The Ropa Vieja had more bell peppers and onions than beef. 
-Being Cuban, I found it odd to be served a over pressed cuban sandwich with congri (rice & beens) 
-Las Masitas de Puerco (pork) wore over fried and dry.
-And to add to it being not authentic, it was really expensive in comparison to real cuban restaurants.

All I can say is if you are hungry and welling to pay more for Non-authentic Cuban Food this is the place for you.

La Cubanita!"}
{"text":"Stopped by and I LOVED the plantains! OMG! I'm going to come here again and again when I'm in this area of town. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the table was wobbly, and the chairs are cheap"}
{"text":"Pros:  The food is really delicious.  I had their Ropa Vieja and DH had their Chicken Cubano.  Both dishes were terrific.  The black beans alone are worth the trip.

Cons: the ambiance.  The exterior is inviting with the Spanish styled roof, but there is a funky aroma when you enter.  Seems to need deep cleaning in the carpet, bathroom, or maybe a fresh coat of paint.  I agree with others who complain about paying $20 + for an entree and sitting on plastic chairs.  Place is dying for some help in the interior.

I probably wouldn't take a date here."}
{"text":"Going to start this one with 4 Stars because we only had Tapas and didn't have any of the delicious looking entrees. 
We went there for Happy Hour on a Sunday. What time is Happy Hour on Sunday? How about this; ALL DAY 4-9p!! 
Such a wonderful waitress that seemed thrilled to be working there and knew the menu in and out. Why? Well because she was Spanish. I haven't been to a Cuban Restaurant before and always assumed Cuban Food was Cuban Sandwiches, well that's Cuban Fast Food. Cuban Cuisine is more like Spanish Food with their own Island Twist! Also very similar to Puerto Rican Food with a slightly different twist as well.
Some awesome specials on food and drink. We kept it simple with a basic Mojito that was great!!! x3 :-P 
We ordered some food from the Happy Hour Menu and some of their Tapas off the dinner menu. 
I will list them out for ease of reading. 
Seviche-Basic but good! Loaded with fresh fish and veggies! 
Frituras de Camarones-Think Shrimp Cakes/Patties with a great sauce!
Calamari Frito-Calamari fried in Almond flour, crispy but not caked in batter, really the best Calamari I've ever had! 
Croquetas de Pollo-Delicious crispy little chicken treats with an awesome sauce
Yuca Frita-Great little Yuca fries with another awesome sauce
Pastelito de Picadillo-Great little puff pastries filled with seasoned ground beef
Albondigas-Little tender balls of beef with an incredible brown gravy! 
Repollo Relleno-Cabbage Leaves stuffed with Chicken and veggies covered in a creamy lime sauce! 
Mojo de Ajo-Warm Garlicky lime and oil that is great for....Well, EVERYTHING to be dipped in! Great for bread dipping!

Just a fantastic experience for us since we loved Tapas Bars in Chicago and ate our way though Puerto Rico for a Week! We will definitely go back for a Full Dinner as our mouths were watering over their Seafood and Pork dishes! Semi-Local place with a nice Island feel as soon as you walk in the door. Also take a look at their schedule for music and dancing as they clearly like to party it up there and make you feel like you're 2000 miles from Phoenix! :-) 
Great stuff! Thrilled we found this place. Strangely enough because we were sent to a dive bar next door and saw this and knew we needed to go back. 
Take the previous LOW reviews with a grain of salt. I don't like to insult other people but I will guess they're just not up to speed on what Spanish and Island food are all about. This menu was put together like Pros!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm from the east cost and when ever I get homesick this is the best place to go. Great food great service. Family run restaurant. I recommend the arroz chofan."}
{"text":"Wow.  We used the \"Completas\" Groupon.  Our whole family raved about the Paradise Pork.  Every item was great.  The kids even loved the Cuban coleslaw.  The chocolate cake was a little dense but filling.  We will be ordering this Take-Out Family Meal again."}
{"text":"As a big fan of Cuban food I couldn't help but stop in here.  My husband and I lived in Florida and Cuban food is either dressy or takeout on the corner but it's all AMAZING.  Since moving to Arizona we have missed our weekly fix and so went on a splurge here.  
The dress code threw us for a loop a little, but they didn't kick us out for my having a tank top on so I can't complain too much.  The menu was good, we both had a tough time picking stuff out, but eventually did settle on the pulled pork and the picadillo.  The food was very very good, but the price was outrageous compared to Florida.  I guess that's what competition buys you, lower prices.
We did like the guitar music, it was high enough to be heard, but not so loud that we were drowned out.  
We won't return often, but we will return when the craving strikes us especially hard."}
{"text":"I love the food here!!! usually get the Pollo Cubano which is delicious. I also like getting the Plantanes (look at the pictures, it's the one with the fried bananas) the bean dip is out of this world! i usually take my friends here to eat and they all seem to like it. this is also a nice place to take that special someone out on a lovely date. it's relaxing and the valet parking makes it seem like you're a million bucks. hahaha"}
{"text":"Been hearing a lot about this place, mixed reviews from different people. So glad that I finally get to go try it for myself. 

As soon as I stepped in to the restaurant, it is already a \"Like\" ... playing some really awesome cuban cha-cha-cha music and the atmosphere was great. A very cute place and love the bee-hive in the middle. 

As for the food, had the empanaditas ... very good, and the puerto rican sampler was a good way to try couple of things at once.  Overall food was pretty good .... it's not like \"WOW\" type of food ... but good for my tummy.  Will certainly go back on a Friday/Saturday night when they have the live band playing to do some cha-cha or salsa ;-) 

Recommended !!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I just found this place and it's a great spot for date night! I had the cho cho and I'm still dreaming about it!"}
{"text":"Tasty tapas, good service and a really feel to the place. Well worth the trip for dinner."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner at Havana cafe - I would say it is in my top five restaurants in Phoenix. Service was decent too - I am surprised to see the negative reviews on yelp.  I may be a bit biased because I studied in Costa Rica in college for a few months, so I love any latin american and carribean comfort food because it brings back great memories.

We shared the platanos maduros and mofongo as appetizers and some mojitos to drink. The mofongo did not sound great to me when I looked at the menu description, but it was amazing. The platanos were great too. I had the pumpkin bisque, which was sweet, salty, creamy and delicious, and some rice and beans. My husband had a pulled pork dish which was also good, and we had some lime pie for dessert. Next time I would order  a little less food,but I am glad we could try each dish - everything was good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently took my father to Havana's cafe in search of something different from the usual chain restaurants.  I read the Yelp reviews and was excited to try the black bean fritters and pulled pork . . . they were okay, but nothing to obsess about.  The pork was sweet, not salty or spicy.  So, if you like sweet pork, this is a good dish for you.  We got the black bean fritters with avocado paste as an appetizer, which were pretty tasty.  However, the highlight of my dining experience was the morros (black beans and rice mixed together).  My husband loved his mojito and my father liked his red sangria.  

The atmosphere was pleasant.  We were there on a Friday night, the place was fairly empty, but despite this, we were seated directly in front of the stage area.  As soon as the guys started to play, our conversation ended.  I would appreciated the option to sit in a quieter part of the dining room.  

Overall, the experience was okay, nothing horrible, nothing extraordinary, just okay.  Undecided if we'll return."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars, but I can't...

After 6 years we finally made it to Havana Cafe due to our recent Groupon purchase...YAY! We always wanted to try it out but the prices always scared us away. 

When we arrived on a Saturday night we were surprised that the place wasn't extremely busy. I told the hostess \"2 please\" and she said do you have reservations? \"Umm no, do we need them\" (as I looked around the half empty place)?!

She said my wait would be about 20 mins, fine, it's Saturday night. We sat at the bar for about 15 mins before the bartender even looked at us. She finally said are you eating dinner at the bar? \"No.\" That was it. 

We finally were seated but it was at the back of the place. My husband and I ordered our drinks. Our server asks as loud as she possibly can for our IDs...ok sure no problem, but did you have to announce it to the half empty room that you are checking our age?! For the record, we are way over 21! 

Our food took FOREVER to arrive. We said the wait better be worth it and you know what...IT WAS! We ordered the Maduros Fritos,  Bistecs Cubanos with smothered onions and Masas de Puerco Fritas both with beans and rice. The meat was tender, the rice was moist and the fried plantains were sweet!  We did try desert, bread pudding and would not order that again. 

We'll probably go back at some point, but we will definitely make reservations and we'll be hitting up lunch for the lower prices!  :)"}
{"text":"I don't have a problem paying $60-$80 for two, but when its worth it.  I think if it wasn't ridiculously over-priced it might have been a better experience.  I'm South American, grew up with Caribbean-Latin American food and I've had better.  But if you've never had Cuban, Puerto Rican or any Latin food; then I guess at least try it once."}
{"text":"Wanted to use my Groupon, and they were closed for renovation! Not sure how long that will last, but you may want to call first if you are thinking of going soon. Will update when I can actually go!"}
{"text":"Good Food... But HORRIBLE Service, FALSE Prices and DISHONEST, UNCARING Manager.

(March 12, 2011) Tonight my girlfriend and I went to the Havana Cafe on Bell Road expecting a casual dinner with good food and good service.  The food was good but everything else was VERY disappointing and frustrating.

1.  The girl who was the hostess was also supposed to be our \"waitress\".  But rather than take our orders and fill our water and soda glasses she wandered off to goof around with the live musician or hang out with people in the bar.  During our meal we had at least 3 different girls serve us but they never did any of the normal waitress duties (re-fill drinks, etc.) without us having to ask them first.

2.  Simply put the Prices in their menu are WRONG from what they actually charge you.  When our \"waitress\" brought me the bill I was surprised to see that the prices were higher than the menu stated.  So I asked the waitress to bring me a menu and sure enough the prices for ALL of our ordered items were higher on my Bill than what the Menu had listed.  For instance we ordered:

- Dinner Sampler -

Menu Price is = $25.95

Billed Price was = $27.95

- Tamal Cubano -

Menu Price = $4.50

Billed Price = $4.75

- Croquetas de Jamon o Pollo

Menu Price = $6.50

Billed Price = $6.75 

The Total Price Difference Including Tax was $2.70.  For two people, ordering 3 menu items, that is just plain outrageous.  I feel really bad for the party of 10 sitting a few feet away from us when I think about how much they must have been OVER CHARGED.

After trying unsuccessfully to explain the overage to our \"waitress\" I asked to speak with the Manager.  When the Manager arrived she bluntly and unapologetically stated that I must have been given an \"OLD\" Menu even though this was the THIRD Menu I had looked at tonight.  FOURTH if you count looking at the Dinner Menu posted on their Website...

http://www.havanacafe-az.com/menus/havana_dinner.pdf 

The Manager then Reluctantly OFFERED to remove the overage.  I'm sorry but removing the Over Charge is the absolute MINIMUM she should have done.  To top it all off she NEVER even offered us an apology for our frustration or trouble.  

If you dare spend your hard earned money at the Havana Cafe, make sure you pay close attention to what they are charging you on your bill.  I can assure you we will NEVER again visit this establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick drink on the way to a birthday party.  Great service and drinks. Try the mojito!"}
{"text":"I am sorry to report that we were disappointed with our experience, both in food and price. It started off great--tasty mojito (although a little on the sweet side) and we came during Yelp Eats week so there were some discounted apps, entrees, and desserts. We started with the shrimp fritters--those were tasty with the almond pimiento sauce--and the green plantains. The sauce served with the plantains was too watery to hold up to the dense starchiness of the plantains so we ordered a side of their homemade banana-guava ketchup. That was delicious and did the trick. They ended up not having one of the advertised Yelp Eats entrees. I thought that was pretty poor form--if they are running a special for a week they should not run out. I ended up ordering fried pork morsels from the full price menu. The pork was so dry that I could barely swallow it, even after dipping it in the sauce. There was no changing the fact that it was simply deep-fried pork chunks--not worth the $21 price tag. I sent the dish back and when I didn't want to order something else off the menu we were reminded that that fine print states that you are not allowed to split Yelp Eats discounted entrees, as if we had planned to send back the full-price dish. After that, we were ignored by the wait staff. The dish we split (bistec cubano) was good, so I can't complain, but wouldn't have been worth it at full price. We finished the meal off with flan and cafe cubano. One cafe was sweetened appropriately, the other had no sugar whatsoever. Food is overpriced and not that great. I certainly won't be returning."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good down home Cuban food & great hospitality your Cuban friends talk endlessly and proudly about growing up with, then will likely not steer you to Havana Cafe.  

The food just isn't truly authentic Cuban & the service leaves you asking, 'why did we come here.'  You want to walk in and feel welcomed here, but you just don't. I've been here several times over the last 7 years and it's always consistent.

The food is over priced too. Come on folks, it's Cuban food...Rice & Beans & avocados..last time I checked, this was the cheapest food to make..Why are you charging $8 for an avocado salad?
Really?  An avocado is $2!

If you want good Cuban food and you're ever in any of these towns, here are some great places to eat & they're truly authentic Cuban food... and you'll feel welcomed!

Los Angeles, visit Versailles--LA or Venice
If you're in Key West--visit Siboney--my favorite! 
Houston--Tropical Island Cafe; El Rey's"}
{"text":"The cuban food was good.  I'm Puerto Rican and I did not like the puerto rican food, it did not taste good, it was very bland and the pasteles were a joke.  I would however return for the cuban food."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I am a repeat customer to Havana Cafe but after tonight's experience I will not be returning, at least not to this location. I love their food but their service is horrible. My opinion on this has been shaped over my last few visits. What happened tonight was the last straw. As usual I went for Mojito Monday. I took my whole family from out of town to show them a great time.
     First off, SLOW service. Second, when the time came to pay the bill (which my bill was made separate from the rest of the party we were with) I pulled out a groupon I had acquired for the occasion. My waitress informed me that if I used it, they could not honor the $3 drink price that happens on Monday. I read through the coupon and no where was that stated. I asked to talk to the manager and my waitress got him but told me he would say the same thing, which he did. 
      I was confused that if I spent $30 or more excluding drinks, why I wouldn't be allowed to still use my Groupon. I asked if the other party at our table was to pay for the drinks could I then use my Groupon and was told no. They blamed it on not being able to alter the checks in their computer system after they were entered. Even after this they split the second check so another card could be used. If the checks can't be altered after they are printed out how could they ever fix any mistakes that were made by accident? What if they had completely messed up our order? The whole thing just didn't make any sense and it seems very silly to lose a customer over something so small. I just felt like it was their way of brushing us off and not honoring the Groupon. 
      We live in hard times. I want to go where my business is appreciated. Why would I patronize an establishment that obviously does not empower their people to take care of the guest?"}
{"text":"Authentic Cuban food. As good as you'll find in Miami or at my house. However I would suggest you skip the appetizers (except the tamales or fried yuca) and go right to main courses. The fried pork chunks and ropa vieja are the very best selections. The Mojitos are very good as well. Skip the desserts and go to Cold Stone instead."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Havana the food and service were impeccable, I was the only one in the restaurant however. My appetizer (Repollo Relleno) and mojito were tasty. The manager suggested the flan and cuban esspresso for dessert and I thought they were delicious (I am not usually a flan lover this converted me). 
The second visit was with my mom and her friends for her birthday. The restaurant was full this visit and alot of things were lacking as well. Customer service, items that were supposed to come with the dish left off and forgotten, we had to flag down a server for refills of our drinks and no suggestions on food or specials were given to my mom even though she told the waitress it was her first time. Overall, I think the food is decent and it is close by my house so if I am in the mood for cuban I would be back but only when no one else is in there eating!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The black bean fritters were as good as everyone said and I loved the Pork Paradise. My boyfriend had the ropa vieja and loved it.  He also thought the black bean rice mixture was the best he ever had!  The sangria was good, but the mojito was the best! Highly recommend!!!  If I am ever back in Scottsdale, this place will be on the list!"}
{"text":"I didn't think the food was that great the lighting in this place made me feel more like I was in a 4th grade classroom than in Havana. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu"}
{"text":"I signed up with Yelp just to write this review. My wife and I moved to AZ recently and we were happy to find a place which sold Cuban and Puerto Rican food. All the dishes we ordered were disgusting!  The fried meat (carne frita) that she ate was dry and flavorless. The mofongo she had was unlike any other we have ever tried. She asked me to try and I just couldn't swallow it. We both love mofongo so that was very disappointing. It doesn't end there my dish was the Puerto Rican plate so I was excited and thought it would bring back some memories of my hometown but it only brought back nightmares. The rice with pigeon peas (arroz con gandules) had way too much tomato sauce... I can go on forever but would rather not. I will just jump to the desert. We thought maybe since the meal was so horrible maybe they could redeem themselves with an awesome flan. When we ordered the flan the waitress said they did not have the large portion but she  could give us the two smaller portions. We said OK but to our surprise the flan was so pale and the taste was so bland. I looked at it carefully and noticed that it had the recycling symbol on it. Who does that!!!  Come on really?!?  I'm done with this place. I would never eat at this restaurant even if they paid me. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless I hated them."}
{"text":"The Chandler location is located in a strip mall.  Strike one.
The decoration of the Chandler location looks very ...80's? Strike two. (  I don't know how to describe it.  The Havana Cafe's Chandler location just doesn't look modern or even retro; the interior just looked outdated.)

They got on base with the food.  We ordered \"Tostones\", which are twice fried plantains with a mojo garlic sauce and an order of Empanaditas for the appetizers for four of us.    Both were satisfying.

For dinner, I ordered Pollo Cubano, chicken breast in light curry, lime, and garlic with sauteed sweet onions on top.   The winner at the table was the Gallina Frita, shredded chicken breast, pan fried with onions laced with a garlic sauce.   Can't decide from all the choices that sound good on the menu?  Do as my husband did and order the Dinner Sampler and try a variety.   At the end, we were too stuffed to try desert.  (Well, for the record, everyone else was too stuffed.  I would have been game to try something, but I didn't want to look like a pig :)

I thought the food was good, but a overpriced for the meal.  Our service was spot on and attentative, but as the other reviews seemed to indicate, and our friends feedback validated, the service can be spotty.

I say - try the place out.  We would definately go back."}
{"text":"The black beans and rice could just as well become my staple food in this crap economy.  Rounded out with exceptionally good maduros fritos it's a peasant meal, when I don't want to splurge.

Caribbean at it's most relaxed."}
{"text":"This is Sharon, hijacking my sisters phone so I can tell you about the fabulous lunch we had at Havana Cafe...all you Yelp users should know about this gem. I like trying different restaurants but have some favorites where I can expect good , interesting food and reliable service. Havana Cafe is one of those places. I've never been disappointed in any of the numerous items I've had on their menu and the hardest part is choosing what to order! Today I took my sisters who are visiting from out of town and they thoroughly enjoyed their first time experience!  I will be back...again & again & again."}
{"text":"If you ever tried \"real Cuban food\" you will be disappointed at the lack of taste and the mundane appearance of the food. The food is overpriced, the tamales are awful, nothing like Cuban tamales at all. The local is poorly decorated,  and you need to bring a butt cushion to make your sitting experience a bit more pleasant on those plastic patio chairs. The service was below average, and one of the waitress could not find a way to smile. Really disappointing. 

Now the goods. Extensive menu, with many legitimate named cuban dishes, may be you will find something good, their name evokes that mysticism and curiosity we have about beautiful Havana,  and,  many people have never tried real cuban food so the restaurant will survive."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Big portions but way to pricy for the food quality. I did get sick after having their salmon. Not sure if it was the mic of foods or what. Most likely not going again"}
{"text":"Would be a solid 4 stars, except the menu seems to be overpriced across the board. 

Met a friend here for a late dinner on a Friday night, the small restaurant (and patio) were about half full. We sat outside. Atmosphere is about what you'd expect from an old strip mall type cafe along Camelback. Nicely set back from the road, though. 

Service was very friendly and helpful, offering suggestions to the overwhelmingly large menu. 

In order to fit the budget, we both went with the special of 3 courses for $19.99. My gazpacho was incredibly tasty & fresh, very delicious. Friend had black bean fritters, which were described as \"very beany\", and good. Main course was chicken with sweet onions, rice & beans for me (can't remember the exact name) and the pulled pork, rice & beans for my friend. Both entrees hit the spot. Dessert choice was chocolate bread pudding, nice, warm and creamy. Yum. 

With two beers and a glass of chardonnay, the total bill was around $65. Not bad, but considering it was the least expensive option on the menu, the presentation, atmosphere and quality wouldn't be enough for me to spend $25-$30 per entree as most were listed. Not quite worth it. 

I'd go back, maybe for lunch or for tapas, just to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I was raised in Miami with a Cuban mother so I think I have enough grounds to say that if you are looking for good Cuban food...this is not the place.  The food was tasteless, not authentic and way over priced. 3 croquetas (tiny ones and def not Cuabn) were $5.50  Dinner was $63 for my wife and I. we left hungry and dissapointed. :("}
{"text":"Not the best food I've had, but certainly the best service and servers around!! Very happy atmosphere! Great place for date night but only for the environment. Still looking for awesome flavorful Cuban food. But yes great little restaurant!"}
{"text":"WOW I was amazed with the great customer service Diane was outstanding!!! I will definately be back the food was great her Colada reminded me of my normal routine walks to the bakery for a colada or a cafe con leche in the mornings. Thanks Diane for your service!!!"}
{"text":"I will not be going back because the owner would not honor my $15 groupon.  My waitress asked her 2 times and she said no.  There are plenty of great places in North Scottsdale...this is not one of them."}
{"text":"I made a special trip to go to the Havana Cafe to buy food for my mother who was just put into hospice care. Imagine my surprise when I arrived at 3:30pm and was told that I could not order off the lunch menu because the kitchen was switching to dinner service. I pointed out that the front door has a sign stating lunch is served until 4pm. The hostess got the manager who refused to allow me to order off the lunch menu. I suggested they change their lunch hour to end at 3:30 instead of 4pm so this wouldn't happen to anyone else. As far as the food, I am Hispanic, and my food makes this food taste like fast food. I only went there for convenience. What a huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Lunch hour..only 2 tables with clients and I still had to wait 4-5 minutes to get somebody to come out and offer me a table.  $17 lunch plus $3 tip for a waitress with no personality. Carne ensebolllada was less than ok. Will not be coming back. Maybe an off day, but honestly fast food started to sound better. Specially for a $20 lunch."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a good Mojito.  I heard they had good Mojitos so I made a trip.  I enjoyed the food, the environment was pretty nice and of course the drinks we amazing!  I was a little taken aback by the fact that they seat you in cheap plastic lawn chairs however, the rest of the experience was great! 
I will be back...."}
{"text":"I had not been to this resturant in some time, now I remember why I have not been back.  The food is ok, however the atmopsphere is sub par for sure.  I had the cuban meatloaf, the meat and glazed yuca were dry, but eitable and fried bananas were obivously from a package.  The only thing great was the black beans.  

For the prices of the food, you would think you would have more then a plastic chair to sit in.  One of the people helping to serve food, I think is one of the managers, actually needs a class on how to serve, sorry grasping my glass by the rim is not a proper way to serve a drink.  Also you need to wash your hands before serving food after counting money.  The cleaning bottle for the tables was on the same counter as the serving counter/mixing area for drinks.

They really need a refresher course on food handling.  Possibily over due for a health inspection too.  I was very disappointed in my experienxe."}
{"text":"Oh no oh no oh no :[ The decline of one of my favorite restaurants is upon us, which makes me very sad. This might be a bit long as I normally hold Havana Café very near and dear to my heart. 

Over the last 4 years I have been to each of the three locations (north valley, Central and Chandler - which has since closed) and loved each. Consistently good food, drinks, and service. The past few times I have visited, I've started to see the signs of a decline in quality, but last night really sealed the deal. 

The mojitos - These are what DRIVE me to the restaurant. I have long said that the mojitos at Havana Café are my very favorite libations that have ever crossed my lips. Always very fresh, not too sweet, lots of mint, and perfectly strong. Last night they tasted like they came from a MIX. I do have to say that they were quite strong, so that was nice as I do enjoy a bit of a buzz, but that was about the only redeeming quality. A microscopic amount of mint, syrupy taste, and why on god's green earth were they PINK?! They were never pink before! 

The food - I had my usual, the Paradise Pulled Pork. It was tasty as always! They have definitely messed with the portions though. You used to get an equal amount of pork, to the rice and bean mixture. That being said, you still get a considerable amount of food. But for $20 it stung a bit to be given the shaft on my tasty shredded swine. 

My honey had the Gambas y Pollo which we really enjoyed. It was quite tasty! Yummy sauce that complimented the shrimp quite well.

The service - Really pretty bad. The man who took care of us (and the only one who was there serving) was not outright rude, but I felt like we were interrupting the bookkeeping that he was doing at the table in the corner, by coming in to eat (we were not the only people there). When my man asked him whether he liked the mojito or the caipirinha better, he made sort of a big deal of saying that in the (large amount) of years he has worked there, he has never tried either as they just don't appeal to him. An odd answer for sure, but I guess honest. He gave both of us a really crappy vibe. While we were there he actually threw something at the busboy. 

I have experienced this man before - and once saw him repeatedly being extremely rude to a guest on the patio over the entire course of my dinner. I don't know the whole story but it was very off-putting. That experience almost had me saying I was not going to come back to this location, but what can I say, it's always been a fav of mine. 

I REALLY hope this was a fluke, as I would hate to see such a previously amazing restaurant take this bad of a nose dive. 

I almost feel like I've lost a best friend. 

TL;DR - Great food. Definitely overpriced especially on account of the shrinking portions. Shitty service. POOR mojitos (which previously would knock my socks off)."}
{"text":"My wife and I love ethnic foods, especially when the restaurants feel as different as the food. So tried Havana Cafe on a hunch and were very impressed with both. Felt like I was in a smaller, yet nice street-side cafe/resaurant in Latin America. Good start. First, we got the Repollo Relleno (pulled pork stuffed into 2 cabbage rolls, very lightly crusted on the outside and served with a light cream lime sauce and lemon slices. Light and savory.

The Empaniditas de Longosta (Lobster Stuffed into tiangle-shaped crusts (similar to pot pie crust). It was on the lunch special and also delicious. This one a bit more filling yet equally as good.

Also got the Seviche, which in our opinion was the best seviche we've ever had. Was a really delicious, yet light, served as a medley of seafood with avocado, citrus, white asparagus and lime sauce over greens.

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Found this place through a groupon. This was my  WORST Dining experience EVER! The hostess was not friendly almost annoyed to have to seat us. Waiter took forever to greet us and take our order. I was hoping to get something authentic as I have close friends that are Cuba and  Puerto Rican I have had some of their very authentic home cooked meals that are to die for!  The food at Havana Cafe was very lack luster as if it was just preheated and served with a hefty price tag. Makes me wonder why they are offering Goupons so often to this place. It's just going down hill! Not to scare you but the worst of it was my fiance got food poisoning from her Camarone's Havana Dish! I will surely not be returning...just in all a REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"When I read the menu description for chorizo-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon, I nearly fainted. Unfortunately, the dish was a big let down. The chorizo was bland, the date was mealy, and the bacon limp (and no one likes limp bacon). The seven other tapas we ordered weren't much better. Worse, the food is overpriced. Happy they had both light and dark Sagres (Portuguese beer) in stock. Two stars are for very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Food was ok so theres the 1 star. Service sucked! Way way pricey!! when we first walked in the host said we needed reservations because all the tables were reserved but then said that there was one table available. We sat for awhile, waiter finally came out and we asked what he recommended and he really didn't know what to say. We figured it out but it was not worth $100. Oh and we left close to closing and no one showed up for the 'reserved' tables.
I do not recommend nor would i ever go back."}
{"text":"Authentic Cuban food for a great price.  I was shocked to see the bill was so low when the waiter brought it to me. Great Mojito as well. Maybe the best in PHX!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Always got the pollo cubano and the paradise pulled pork. Both are fantastic. You get a pretty big serving that can be split. Try to get there on a Friday or Saturday when the band is playing, it really adds to the atmosphere. Also, if you can, get the fried plantains. Can't go wrong with that. Also, all of their desserts are completely homemade and incredible. I didn't know mangos could do that. 
I can't really speak for too many other menu items, since it was impossible to deviate from the goodness of the pollo cubano and pulled pork."}
{"text":"A Midwest girl's Cuban haven.

I went here twice Valentine's Day weekend. 5 stars for the mojitos. 5 stars for the Black Bean Fritters. 5 stars for the service.

Very casual, cozy environment. I'll be back here the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by here a couple Saturday's ago for dinner.  I was interested in trying it because I love Cuban food and had read good things about it on Yelp.  

I liked that it was different from your typical dining-out fare.  We got a sampler and some tapas and a salad to share.  The black bean fritters were good and the plantains were as expected.  What I wasn't fond of was that the texture of nearly everything we had was the same (except the salad).  There was a slight \"mush\" feel to everything and the spices were all similar in taste.

The sangria was OK and the Mojitos were good...by no means the best I've had.  I had the flan with a pumpkin sauce for dessert and if you are craving something sweet and not too heavy, I'd recommend it....but don't expect it to knock your socks off.  The waiter forgot to put in our salad order so after asking about it he rushed and served it last.  We ended up taking it home since we were too full to eat it there.

All in all, an OK place to go for something different.  The food is good but not spectacular.  A little pricey but you do come away stuffed so the value is OK.  Worth giving it a try and going back on occasion."}
{"text":"If people in heaven eat, Havana Cafe is doing the catering. 

We had dinner here last night. When we first walked in, the decor and the plastic chairs were a bit off-putting, given the menu isn't exactly full of budget meals. But we quickly got over that when the Capirinhias arrived. 

The food: 
Potage de Frijoles Negros- hands down the best black bean soup i've ever had. I could easily eat just this for days. 

Pollo Cubano- The chicken and onions are very citrusy, and the meat is tender. You really have to like onions to fully appreciate this dish. Three stars.

Gallina Frita- Fantastic. The shredded chicken was full of flavor, and the onions and spices complemented each other perfectly. The rice and beans that come with this dish are different (Moros) than the standard, and they are wonderful. The dish also comes with plantains, which are good, if you like plantains. Five stars.

Chicharrones de Pollo- I wasn't a big fan of this one. It's fried chicken, but it had a very odd flavor from the citrusy marinade. I guess I am too ingrained in my ways regarding fried chicken because this just didn't do it for me. Another strange thing about this dish is the chicken itself- rather than having a leg or a thigh, the fried chicken pieces were the meat pieces used for making chicken wings. Two stars.

Bistecs Cubanos (Encevollado style) - I don't like beef. This steak, however, is probably the one beef dish I could eat with abandon. The meat is pounded thin and smothered with onions. Five stars, because I hate beef, and I loved this. 

Pudin de Pan con Helado- I tend to shy away from bread pudding because of the usually disgusting consistency. We ordered this on a recommendation from the server, though, and it was fantastic. Chocolate bread pudding with chocolate chips....yum. Top it with ice cream and you've made a great thing even better. Four stars. 

We didn't try anything from the tapas menu, or any of the other entrees that sound delicious. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Kid sized portions- left with a starving stomach and a lighter wallet.  My cup of coffee was not even 1/2 way full.  My food arrived on a doll size plate, only about 5 bitez. Ordered dessert and was quickly let down by that portion, too...shocker. I have seen children's meals with larger portions.  It would take double the amount of food to satisfy me.
Too bad because if the portions were better I might have been able to appreciate the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place when I am in Scottsdale.  A co-worker turned me onto it and I am now making multiple visits when I am in town.  The black bean fritters and papa rellena's are top notich - lots of flavor.  My favorite is the Ensalada Cubana, a cuban sandwich without the bread.  All of the ingrediants are fresh and flavorful but the chopped pickle hearts make this truly special.  It's hard to try anything new now. The Pargo Veracruz is a snapper filet that is cooked just right in a nice tomato sauce.  The saffron rice didn't overpower, but rather complimented the dish.  Love the mojito and red sangria.  I didn't enjoy the white sangria as much - a little heavy on the wine or something, it just wasn't my taste."}
{"text":"I loved this little slice of heaven.  Reasonable prices, tiny dining room, very personal service.  Pablo was laid back, but with only 4 couples in the small establishment, he did a great job of making sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Though a bit longer of a drive than we normally make for lunch, our office lunch crew wanted something different, so we decided to try and find a Cuban place and came across this one which got us all excited.

When we arrived, we were unimpressed by the exterior, but figured plenty of dives have awesome food.

We were seated fairly quickly in some beautiful...lawn chairs?!  The chairs were the cheap plastic chairs you use when you havee guests in your backyard and don't give a crap about their comfort.  The atmosphere was tacky and unimpressive.

I ordered a chicken sandwich special as I didn't see any torta one the menu (what respectable Cuban place doesn't have a simple torta on their menu?!).  The sandwhich was dry and flavorless and tasted as if it received no seasoning at all.  My companions all looked at their food after tasting it and were disappointed as well.

Receiving a refill on a water was like asking the government to stop spending money, it just wasn't going to happen.

Horrible experience, bland food, overpriced.  In short, never going back and don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great service and really good food. There's more Spanish and Puerto Rican than Cuban, but it's still well executed. The ropa vieja is particularly satisfying.

The house drinks are also good, the Hemingway is outstanding.

Great local restaurant that is also family friendly during the week. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"\"Its like im on vacation! \"said Nathan as we were waiting to get our food. \"It is... I could use the sounds of the ocean though\" then Nathan replies with, \"im just replacing the traffic sounds with ocean sounds\" Good stuff man! 

Nice outdoor seating and lighting, also the heatlamp was effing awesome! it really does have the remote feel, I felt like I was far far away... instead I was only a block from my place. 

The food... holy good god... this shit is awesome. I got some chicken dish with a great orangish, spicy-ish sauce which was unreal. I cant wait to try a few other items on the menu. 

The service was nothing to write home about, but who gives a shit with this type of food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I read the reviews first before going so was expecting a good meal.  Was I ever disappointed.  I had the San Juan special.  It was a sampler plate and nothing on there was all that taste but the pastele, the start entree, was tasteless.  I don't know if the pastele had been frozen too long or not properly defrosted but the consistency was weird.  The food was also pricey for the amount that I got."}
{"text":"First, the food is pricey.  Second, the quality is uneven.  Third, the portions are small.   And fourth the service was poor.  I ordered the San Juan sampler then waited a very long time for a mediocre meal.  For $15 the sampler included a pastele that tasted like it had been defrosted; all mushy and tasteless and a few other items that were not bad but totally forgetable."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is the best around. No one can compare to their cuisine. Have the stuffed poblano. By far the best. I love going for happy hour to get a whole bunch of small plate appetizers. The black bean dipping sauce is so great I could eat it plain. When in season, the pumpkin bisque is one of the best soups I have ever tasted. It is such a fun environment in the restaurant with the appearance and feeling of being on a patio with the comfort of being inside. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Prepared to be surprised with these wonderful tastes."}
{"text":"I was elated when I discovered I'd be in town for the mojito class that the restaurant periodically offers. I'd been eyeing it for years but it never seemed to coincide with my business travels.  Well, luck shone on me and I was able to attend last night.

I must say for $20 tuition, it was a bargain!  The restaurant owner not only teaches the fine art of making a killer mojito, you are also treated to a brief lesson in Cuban history and culture.  It was very interesting!  The restaurant supplies all the ingredients and you craft your own cocktail, according to instruction.  There are also fun prize raffles and lots of laughter.  I can't forget to mention that the class fee also includes a tapas plate featuring some of Havana Cafe's fabulous appetizers.  You also get 15% off if you decide to stick around for dinner.  It was a win-win evening.

I still prefer the original location but I can't visit the Valley without getting my Cuban fix.  Yum."}
{"text":"Haven't been to the Havana Cafe in years.  Forgot all about it until a friend suggested that we have lunch there.  The service was great and so was the food.  Can't remember what the name of the entree was that I ordered, but it was spicy shredded beef with  two skewers of grilled zucchini and mushrooms and plantains as well .... all very good!  

I will put Havana Cafe on the rotation of lunch time spots!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used a Groupon to try Havana Cafe for the first time.  I was a little worried about some of the negative reviews I read on Yelp.  But we were pleasantly surprised.

The service was great.  Our waiter, Steve, was very friendly and attentive.  The busboy refilled our water several times without being asked.  The rest of the staff was very friendly as well.

But more importantly, the food was great.  We ordered the black bean fritters with the avocado dipping sauce.  The fritters were crispy outside and warm and steamy inside.  And the avocado dipping sauce had the perfect amount of spice to compliment the fritters.  We also ordered the plantain chips with black bean sauce.  Also wonderful.  The plantain chips came out warm and lightly salted, which worked well with the black bean sauce.  Then we split the Masas de Puerco Fritas - the pork \"morsels\" in a garlic-lime sauce.  The pork was very moist and tender with the right amount of crispness on the exterior.

Of course we had to try dessert too, and split the Carribean Candy Bar - coconut flan with candied coconut, almonds, whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.  It was delicious!

Overall, the service and food was wonderful.  We will definitely be back.  My ONLY gripe is the plastic chairs..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the perfect spot for a first date, this is it!
Quaint, romantic, and homey are a few words that come to mind.
But the best part for me is; you can not have a bad meal here if you tried, that being said Pollo Cubano is my favorite dish!"}
{"text":"I'm very sad to write this update, but feel obligated to do so. My friend and I called Havana at 8:30pm on a Thursday night (5/12) to find out what time they close. We were 5 minutes away. The woman who answered said they normally close at 9pm but since they didn't have any customers for the past hour, they were closing in 10 minutes. In my opinion, this is unacceptable. We love Havana's food, but feel the service has been hit or miss for years. It was the food that kept us coming back. Now, I'm not sure we will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great selection, and friendly wait staff.  We went to Havana Cafe after hearing that it was the best Cuban place in the Valley and were quite impressed.  Their pumpkin bisque is amazing, the gazpacho also very good, and splitting the dinner sampler was perfect for a couple who likes to eat.  The fried plantains were done perfectly and they also have some \"mini\" deserts that hit the spot but don't overdo it after a big, heavy Cuban dinner.  Try the coconut flan - I'm not even a fan of flan and it was to die for!

One small complaint:  they were out of quite a few things when we went, but with such a robust menu, it didn't really matter.  It was also Saturday night around 8:30, so it's somewhat understandable."}
{"text":"Ah, the dreaded worst-experience of my life, horrible service, overcharged BIRTHDAY meal...that ended up in moderate-severe food poisoning.

I'm talking the kind of food poisoning where at one point I desecrated the restrooms of a lovely restaurant in downtown Phoenix and ended up laying face down on the sidewalk...to where a homeless man asked me if I was ok.

Yeah.  It was that bad.  Food poisoning aside, it was STILL the worst meal of my life, and this WAS my favorite low-key restaurant in the valley.

Apparently my birthday fell on the last day of a groupon or livingsocial redemption.  Unlucky us, we paid full price (more than actually...since we were charged for the wrong items they brought out and subsequently took back), and were treated worse somehow than the coupon folks -- because it was a set menu and so the kitchen didn't want to make things not on THAT menu -- despite our paying full freaking price.

FACT: When one is celebrating their birthday, they want a cocktail.  I wanted a cocktail.  Actually, I wanted three.  I got my first cocktail after I'd been there nearly an hour (oh yeah, the \"10 minute\" wait I was told about was actually 40).  I didn't get a refill.  Or asked if I wanted a refill. Of that drink, or my water.  But I asked!  Oh, did I ask!   I drank my water and my dining companions.  And then eventually drank the melted ice from my un-refilled mojito. The 2 employees (great staffing job on a day you know will be busy with coupon redeemers!) were basically losing their minds, running around, and super stressed.  They had basically given up by the time we were eating. 

That is why I feel like the food poisoning occurred from something truly awful. Like employees deliberately fucking with my food horrible.

I'm not sure what they normally do when people have their birthday at a restaurant, but we weren't offered dessert menus, let alone a comped dessert.  They knew it was my birthday.  They knew at the beginning we were paying the full price.  And still...worst.service.ever.

***I actually filled out a comment card back in November listing my email address and phone number, where I specifically requested to be contacted (again, this was before the food poisoning).  This review was written right after the visit, and I sort of \"sat\" on it for literally over 6 months, in hopes someone would actually contact me.  I gave them the chance, I guess they really just don't give a shit."}

{"text":"we have frequented the Havana Cafe for more than 18 years.

the food and service are consistently good and the menu items are creative and offer a great selection.

{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. Unfortunately, our dinner just kept disappointing. Thank baby Jesus for Groupon, because if we had spent full price for our meals, I'd probably develop an eye twitch. 

I went with their $18 vegetarian dinner special (poblano stuffed peppers with white beans, covered in a creamy tarragon sauce) over rice. My boyfriend ordered the Gallina Frita (shredded fried chicken breast with onion and Moros- rice and black beans).

The presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2\"x 2\"-- a sad display. 

The chicken entree was dry and almost tasteless, except for the overly salted moros. My boyfriend didn't even finish the chicken nor did he want my corn bread. This is a first on so many levels. 

This was Cuban cuisine?! Where's the seasoning? The spices? Where is the flavor?! 

We left the Havana cafe and bid adieu to the plastic chairs and the tasteless plates of microwaved sadness."}
{"text":"Yelp alerted me that I have a review to complete, from nearly 2 years ago. 

I remember how I felt about this place back then, and still feel strongly about this place now. Recollections of how much I would not like to return to this place again. 

Find a place that serves Cuban-inspired food, or if there is a frozen aisle that does, heat it up in a microwave, transfer it onto a plate, and voila! Of course you'll remember to remove that non-microwaveable plastic film that Havana overlooked."}
{"text":"\"My wife and I ate there a few weeks back, I thought the atmosphere was quaint and inviting however after we were sat it took quite some time before our waiter came back to us for anything. I found him to be unwelcoming and inattentive the 2 Hispanic helpers were much more courteous and attentive. The food was Ok  it wasn't horrible but i would not write home about it. It was my fist time there and maybe it was an off night but i would be reluctant to recommend the place to a friend or return simply because the service was horrible. I do how however like ambiance."}
{"text":"I just now got back from a group lunch at Havana Cafe. Terrible Visit.

Unbelievably SLOW  service (a TWO HOUR lunch? Are you serious?) and the food wasn't that great. I was really disappointed. I have been DYING to try Havana Cafe for a few weeks now and finally got my lunch buddies to go.

We arrived at the restaurant at 12:09pm which I know for certain because I received a text at that time. We were seated and we ordered our drinks. By the time our drinks came everyone was ready to order their meal. We waited almost an hour before the bread basket was plopped on our table. We were expecting our meals shortly after. Our food was served to us over 1 hour after our arrival. 

I ordered the San Juan Combination plate that came with a little of everything. How do I say this nicely? Um, I don't think I will be ordering that again. The Pastele was old and dry. Usually when you cut into a tamal or pastele, it doesn't crumble or break. Mine did. The mofongo seemed like it was sat to dry out. It came out in two mounds and both mounds were greasy and dry (is that possible? yes.) The alcapurrias were tasty and tangy. Still a little greasy for my taste, but they were ok. I mean you can't wring out deep fried food. The tostones were not good. Again, something that was left to dry out. They were neither crispy nor edible. They were fried all to hell and I couldn't eat them. I took one bite of them and sat them aside. They made a lovely garnish though. The arroz con gandules was the highlight of the plate. The beans and rice were tender and tasty and the olives and capers gave the dish just enough zip. The masas de puerco fritas were greasy little chunks of pork that were ok once I dipped them in the mojo. 

All of us were underwhelmed with our meals. Nothing spectacular nothing amazing, and everyone commented that things were cold, or greasy.

Next long wait, the check to be paid. We decided to split the check 6 ways. Easy right? Wrong. It took another 15 minutes to get that done. Just an FYI, parties of 6 or more get an automatic gratuity on their bill. The service was awful and I think 18% gratuity was very generous. We left at 2:08pm.

I don't know if I'm brave enough to give Havana Cafe a try again. I might go back to try their drinks. Usually a good amount of alcohol makes anything taste good so that might boost their rating up a bit. 

I was really looking forward to Havana Cafe, but my friends and I agree that this place was disappointing."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Havana Cafe several times, and the food and experience gets worst every time.  This latest experience will be my last time.  I was not impressed with the service or the food.  I took my girlfriend there on a Friday and had dinner around 8:00.  The drinks took forever to arrive, our food actually arrived before the drinks did.  I ordered the Chicharrones de Pollo which is like a fried chicken dish.  I went to take a bite and didnt realize it had foil on the bottom of the chicken.  The chicken wasn't cooked to order, it was pretty much reheated.  You ever taken a bite of food and bit down on foil, not the most pleasant experience on the pallet.  The chicken was warm and they didnt even do a good job re-heating it.  My girl ordered the Sailors Paella which had a variety of seafood on rice.  The dish was 24,00 but not nearly worth the price.  The dish said their were suppose to have crab, calms, mussels, scallops, shrimp, fresh fish on safforn rice.  I couldnt find any crab, scallops or calms in the dish.  It was mostly fish in the dish.  Not only that, but the dish had a fishy smell to it.  The seafood clearly wasn't fresh.  It was old seafood.  Not impressed at all.  The total bill was around 60 bucks.  I felt like we were scammed out of our money.  

Ths is the last straw, we will not be eating at this place again.  Also when we left the restaurant there were bunch of people standing outside smoking, (next to a liquor/smoke shop)  I barely could breathe walking out of there."}
{"text":"I recently moved down the street from Havana and I had heard great things. 
I've dined here a few times now and the food is amazing!
My favorites are the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters,avocado dip) and Camarones Havana. So good!!
The mojitos are really good too. 
The only problem with Havana is the speed of service. The servers are always friendly, but things take FOREVER to get to the table. Even my Mojito took 20 min last time.
I will continue to come here for the killer food, but don't come if you are on any type of schedule, starving or really thirsty...it will take awhile."}
{"text":"Havana is heaven. It's absolutely amazing; I love it there and you will too. The cafe is filled with green plants and furniture and snazzy decor, that's right, snazzy. But of course, the food and adult beverages are the best part.

I usually order a few appetizers there; my absolute fave is the black bean fritters that come with an avocado dip. Holy yum! It's unbelievable. I also recommend the pastelitos (puff pastry) filled with spinach and cheesy goodness. The black bean soup is de-lish and has a little kick to it.

You have to cool all the zest and spices down with a sweet, banana daiquiri... when in Cuba, right? Naomi Garnice gives this place two thumbs up, love it!

I went to Havana again this month for a Mojito Class -- it was so much fun! We learned how to make strawberry, watermelon and classic mojitos complete with our own individual muddlers. Be sure to join the mailing list when you go in to get notified of upcoming events!"}
{"text":"As someone who grew up eating home cooked Cuban food finding this place was a welcomed event!

First and most importantly - the mojitos are legit!  Perfectly made.

The food is very tasty and authentic and the server (Christine ?) was very welcoming and attentive.

I really can't wait to go bad for mojito happy hour! :)

Great place to get your fix."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Tapas joint in town. It's a place I have to get the same thing everytime and maybe more to try a few new items... my must haves are:

Island Gingered Yam & Pumpkin Bisque Soup (Seasonal)... so good and the fact that it's seasonal makes it even more of a special treat.

Camarones Al Ajillo (Garlic Shrimp)... this is my all time favoreite dish thus far @ Havana... I can eat it as my meal as long as they provide me as much of their tasty bread as I need to sop the dish dry of all the yummy garlic sauce it contains.

Maduras Fritos... Fried plantains... need I say more?

Mojito... best in town in terms of authenticity.

Marquesas de Chocolate aka Chocolate Pate... I never cared for dessert here until I tasted this strangely named treat. It is so rich at first you think it will be too little but then you realize you need to share with everyone at your table.

Other worthy options: 
Arroz Con Pollo... It has baby peas in it and I really don't like peas... but I like them in this dish! I got to try this dish because a friend ordered it as his meal and didn't even make a dent in it... so I got all the leftovers and it was pretty tasty and economical!

Fritoras de Frijoles Negros... I've never had Black Bean Fritters before--they are quite tasty dipped in Guacamole!

Calypso Chips...A thinner more chippy version of Fried Plantains.

Sun Spots... Sweet Potato Fritters pretty tasty as well... for a fried root vegetable!

Datiles Con Chorizo... A meatier appetizer... not the best I've had but pretty darn good.

Empanaditas... These are alright... though I'm partial to Filipino style Empanadas... but since I have no place to buy them from, nor have I mastered making them, these are quite good for a band-aid craving.

Tamal Cubano... pretty tasty, but my fave is the soupier Salvadorean take on the chicken tamale.

Flan... haven't had it, but flan consistency throughout varying cultures seems pretty consistent.

Free Goodness: Their Bread! It's just the way I like it, hot, thin and crisp crust and soft in the middle!

As you can see, outside of the Arroz Con Pollo, I have not tried many of their entrees... I'm quite content to dine with others and share Havana's wonderful tapas... but one day I WILL try their Paella. A vegetarian friend said they make a veggie paella that was pretty tasty... and she loves their Mojitos just as much as I do so I think she may be right on this one. Can't wait to try it... with a side of Camarones al Ajillo and a Mojito!"}
{"text":"The fiancé and I love Cuban food. We had a couple die hard favorites back in SoCal that we would frequent on a monthly basis. We've been missing our Cuban craving fix since moving here to Phoenix. So last Friday evening as we were deciding where to get our grub on we happened to pass by Havana Cafe. The fiancé had heard good things about this place from coworkers so we decided to bust a U turn and give it a try. 

It is located in a small strip mall with a metal gate door. A little sketch looking but we weren't deterred because good food often comes from little dives. The place was pretty busy but we were seated right away. It was a little weird for us to be seated side by side on a bench which the hostess first had to slide the table forward, allowing us access to the bench, and then proceeded to slide the table back in towards us so we were essentially boxed in. But moving on....The place is loud with great live music but you find yourself having to talk really loud to your server to get your order in. 

My fiancé ordered his usual favorite: ropa vieja. I couldn't really find anything that looked especially appealing to me...for a reasonable price at least. So I settled on a tamal cubano and the ceviche from the appetizer menu. Overall, the food was good. We enjoyed the ropa vieja and the ceviche. I only wished that the ceviche came with chips instead of crackers. The tamale was good and had bits of pork in it which made it more of a crowd pleaser for the fiancé. However, both of us felt that we didn't enjoy our meals as much as we do at our fave Cuban place back home. Plus, we didn't feel our meals were worth the prices here so we left a little unsatisfied. Don't get me wrong...we are not opposed to spending good money on food that we feel is worth it so please note that our review is not because we're cheapskates or anything. But if you plan on hitting this place up then be prepared to pay $20 and up per entree. 

Bottom line is that we may or may not go back. Nothing really wrong with this place but nothing overly exciting either. Maybe a future visit will change my opinion but until then we will be continuing our search for our go to Cuban spot."}
{"text":"In just a few short days, I've fallen in love with this place.  I wanted to come here for a while so when I saw the Groupon, I jumped at the chance.  As a Caribbean girl, I love the down home feel and the generous portions (pero un pequeño caro).  Also, everyone here is really nice!  I love Cuban food and am very familiar with it being from a neighboring island (Haiti).  

Everything I've tried here so far has been really delicious!  So far I've had the Cho Cho (yeah for a veggie dish), Frituras de Frijoles Negros, Sangria soda, some nectars, Tres leche, Pudin de Pan con Chocolate, and of course Maduros Fritos!!!  I suggested the Chicharrones de Pollo for my friend who was unfamiliar with Cuban food and she loved it.  We came here two days in a row.... (sigh) I am slowly becoming addicted!!"}
{"text":"Bring on the mojitos!  Or a pitcher of sangria. Both are terrific at Havana.  Even if you aren't interested in alcohol you are in luck. This place is worth it without the booze too.

Every time I come here I am so happy. The place is usually bustling and busy, yet I never have to wait. The service is so friendly that I feel valued as a patron and the food is great.  

Some of the dishes I recommend: 

- The salads are out of this world. All of them are a good choice. My fave involves onions, avocados and mangoes

- The Cho-Cho is a great vegetarian dish. I'm a flesh eatin', animal killin' meat eater but I still enjoy this menu item

- Fish! Every fishy is yummy here. The best are the Sea Bass, Shrimp and the Tilapia

 - The Pollo Cubana is an excellent basic chicken/rice/bean dish 

 - The Ropa Vieja was okay. Pretty good but not out of this world

- The desserts are excellent. The coconut flan with mango sauce is my new favorite thing ever 

- They put limes in my diet coke. YES! Nice touch.

* One word of caution: They make you valet during the weekend. Not a fan of the unnecessary (but very personable) valet. Boo!

** Second word of caution: The bathrooms are outside and around the corner. Be prepared to feel like you are walking down a shady alley if you have to pee. Maybe fear of an alley attack is part of the charm. Just like in Cuba, I guess."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place...i love cuban food...my favorite is fried plantains and the black beans and rice...yum yum...i am obssessed with their mojitos...it is a little pricey but good food is worth it...it is different...the restaurant is very small and quaint...the staff is so sweet and nice and give great suggestions..."}
{"text":"The food was good but not for the cost. The dough for the empanaditas was ok, very salty though. The chicken filling was delish. Ropa vieja was similar to Venezuelan carne machada. I received more rice, beans and veggies than meat."}
{"text":"I love Cuban food. Moved here from Miami and lived on Cuban food there...authentic Cuban food. Went to Havana Cafe yesterday and was very excited. The atmosphere was not bad. It was around two in the afternoon so it was empty. Very nice staff. The menu is interesting, but it is not true Cuban food, but a their version of Cuban recipes.  I have to say that the food was just okay. The presentation was nice, but the food itself was without flavor all together.  The quality of the products used were good, but missing the flair of true caribbean flavor.  Unfortunately I will not be going back to Havana Cafe. My search for Cuban food in the valley continues."}
{"text":"Being Hispanic and having grown up eating authentic dishes, I can usually tell what's good Latin food and what's not. Havana Cafe doesn't even come close. I can make better food at home. Their pasteles were bland, as was their rice and their beans. The mojito was pretty good, but not worth being disappointed over the food. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Food & Drinks: 4 stars
Service: negative 5 stars

We've been to Havana Cafe twice, however, the service that we received on our most recent visit is enough to make us rethink attempting to dine there again.  On our first visit, we sat at the bar and had some mojitos and tapas.  The mojitos were some of the better ones that I've found in the Valley and all three of the tapas items had great flavor and as the bartender explained, were homemade with fresh ingredients.

We were excited to come back and try out some of the entrees for dinner and returned about a week later.  There were only three other tables that were occupied, yet we were seated along the front \"window\" which is a sun-warped dingy looking sheet of some sort of plastic rather than glass.  Needless to say, this did not add any ambiance to our meal.  I ordered a cup of black bean soup and the Cho Cho, which is described on the menu as \"Fresh Chayote squash stuffed with lentils, corn, carrots and onions. Topped with a Jamaican Curry cream sauce. Served with white rice and a spicy green tomato chutney.\"  My husband ordered a cup of the zucchini soup that was a daily special and the Berenjena con Garbanzo described as \"Grilled purple eggplant stuffed with chickpeas, fresh tomatoes, onions, Manchego and Parmesan cheeses and thyme. Served with fresh asparagus, on a bed of white rice and topped with a creamy sherry tomato sauce.\"  We waited at least 15 minutes for the two cups of soup to make their way out. My black bean soup was excellent and I would certainly order it again.  My husband's zucchini soup was also very flavorful.  Before we were even done with our soups, a waiter brought out our entrees and tried to remove our soups while we were still eating them.  We told him that we'd like to finish the soups first so he just set our entrees alongside each of us and walked away, leaving our empty drink glasses on the table without asking if we'd like another round of drinks.  

When I finished my soup and moved my entree in front of me, I could tell that we should have stuck to the tapas that we'd had last time.  It actually looked like someone had thrown up in my plate.  The squash certainly weren't stuffed, but rather, there were a couple pieces of squash found beneath a pile of carrots, red peppers, and onions with a yellow, gelatinous sauce poured over the top on a huge pile of white rice.  The veggies themselves would have been edible if not for the strange sauce that had been applied.  It had only the slightest hint of a curry flavoring and had a texture that seemed to indicate that it had been thickened with cornstarch.  I tried the rather flavorless chutney served on the side only to discover the same cornstarchy texture.  Now, I certainly would not knock a restaurant for making an authentic dish that I just don't happen to care for, so if this is how this dish was supposed to turn out, then those who prefer this presentation would probably enjoy it, but I really couldn't manage to eat more than a few bites before deciding to call it a loss and order something else.  My husband's entree, while better than mine, was also less than exciting and tasted to me like a very bland version of eggplant parmigiana.  He liked his well enough to continue eating (this may have had something to do with the fact that we were both starving when we came in). 

Now here is where the service really goes downhill.  For the next 30 minutes, no one came by to find out how the food was or ask if we'd like drinks.  In fact, we didn't even see any of the three wait staff even enter the dining room.  Finally, when my husband finished his meal, the waiter came over and asked if I'd like my entree boxed up, to which I replied \"no, but I'd like to see a menu to order something else.\"  He promptly brought over a dessert menu so I then had to explain that the reason my entree was still in its entirety on my plate is because I didn't care for it and would like to order something to eat for dinner.  He brought back a menu, dropped it on the table and waited while I decided to order the Tortilla Espanola.  He then quickly darted away before we even had a chance to order drinks.  Having sat there for at least 40 minutes with empty glasses, I finally got up from the table, walked into the bar, and placed the empty glasses on the bar.  The two waitresses who were sitting at a table in the bar area chatting apologized for the wait and said that they'd have drinks right out. About ten minutes later our drinks appeared along with my Tortilla Espanola which was as delicious as when I'd had it during our prior visit.  The waiter did take my entree off of our bill, but in my opinion, the poor service that we got in a nearly empty restaurant is inexcusable.  It really is a shame that this place isn't able to pull itself together to provide an excellent dining experience given that there are in fact many palatable selections on the menu."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to making this a restaurant that I could frequent often since I am a huge fan of Latin food. I invited my grandparents to meet me here for dinner back in March 2011. The inside of the restaurant is inviting until you realize that your chairs are those that you see at Lowe's for a backyard pool party....plastic? Come on for the prices they are asking averaging $20-35 a plate. Why plastic chairs? We started off with 4 mojitos and some appetizers. Platanos-fried plantains with garlic sauce. They were okay but found them to be more on the chewy side than crispy. We all had Ropa Vieja with potatoes and rice. I was disappointed in my main entree as it was overpriced for the quality of food that I was served. My grandparents seemed to enjoy their dishes but also were so engaged in making the evening special since it was the night before my grandmother's birthday. My bf was not impressed with his entree either. This is not real Cuban food and I can tell you this because I have a close friend who is Cuban that has cooked for me. get your passport and travel to Cuba through Canada and go have yourself some REAL Cuban cuisine not this crap that they \"call\" Cuban food. It is overpriced for all that you get. it got two stars because the service was attentive and staff was friendly plus the 3 mojitos I drank were the best out of everything there!"}
{"text":"i love the food here!very expensive,the service is very slow,only one food server,i really dont like to wait around for 40 minutes for food when i work all day without lunch plus i have to pay a food that expensive!not worth of my time,lots of restaurant out there folks who will care for good customer service!"}
{"text":"- I must disclosed that this dining was done about a month and a week ago.

   As you walk into this place you feel relaxed by the delightful Cuban music playing loud enough to hear in the background. I also love the dimmed lighting, oh soo relaxing!!
   We were then pleasantly surprised by a warm greeting along with a big smile by our charismatic host, after the place was fully packed. We didn't even bother making a reservation, since the previous time I had visited this spot  was with my best friend who was actually the one who introduced me to this nice little spot, Special thanks Mr. B, and at that time, It was just about half way full. 
   So we weren't expecting to be seated right away, but we were, very nice!!. My boyfriend and I were both hungry, as usual, so we right away ordered the black bean fritters as our starting appetizer. We were surely pleased, they were hot and mushy on the inside served with a side of avocado dip, OH soo YUM, we also ordered ourselves the lime mojitos, talk about refreshingly good!!
     We later ordered our main dishes, Tim got the Pollo Cubano and I ordered the Chicharones de Pollo, it was all pretty dang delicious!! Very flavorful, and just down right taste buds satisfying!! 
    We finally topped it off with my favorite, Arroz con Leche!! This on the contrary was just OK, it lacked cinnamon i think, I have made way better arroz con leche myself, If you like I'll share my recipe, but the appetizer and our chicken Cuban plates were bomb!! :)

Thank you Havana Cafe for the great service and good food!! :)"}
{"text":"Havana Cafe is a fun little place -- live guitar music, yummy drinks, plastic chairs and fake plants that make me think I could be somewhere in the Caribbean... it's nice!
My husband and I went here on Friday night. I hadn't been to a Havana Cafe for a while, although I used to frequent the one in Arcadia. 
I got two caipirinhas, which were a little too sweet, but still tasty. Plus, it's not easy to find those drinks in Phoenix, so H.C. gets a star just for that! We had the fried plantains for an appetizer, which were just OK. But my dinner -- the vegetarian \"cho cho\" -- was great. It's chayote cooked with lentils and veggies and a \"Jamaican curry sauce\" over rice. Delicious and huge. My husband loved the mixed parrilla he ordered, too.
For dessert, we ordered the flan and it was amazing. Definitely the best flan I've had in years. Not too sweet and the perfect consistency, and the caramel sauce that it came with had this great kind of creme-brulee flavor. 
Havana Cafe was definitely better than I remembered it being! The only downside is that the service was sort of slow. We didn't mind, because we weren't in any hurry, but I could see where it might be annoying if you had somewhere else to be."}
{"text":"Havana Cafe is a local gem.  Phoenix has no shortage of ethnic cuisine; however, when it comes to Latin American food sans Mexican, choices get slim fast.  I think I've tried almost all of the Latin American restaurants in the valley--and I've the odometer readings to prove it--but this place was right near my house and I never thought to give it a try.  It's Charming.

I've had several different dishes at Havana, and by far my favorite was the Cuban appetizer sampler.  Everything on the plate was delicious.  And, yes, the black bean fritters do rock!

This is definitely one of my new favorites and I plan on visiting it a few times a year.  I can't go more often than a few times a year, because my wallet ends up in the ER after every visit and it takes a while for it to recover.  Both times I went I was with one other person.  We had appetizers, soda (no alcohol), entres.  The first time we had desert.  The first visit my wallet took a $100 hit.  The second time my wallet took an $82 hit (both amounts included a 20% tip).

So, go, enjoy the food.  Enjoy eating food that is quite good and not common to the valley.  Enjoy the charming atmosphere and the fresh air patio.  But, crack open that piggy bank before you go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have had this on our \"go-to\" list for a while so finally checked it out the other night. We were only one of five tables in the entire restaurant. I enjoyed the Cuban decor. They obviously have a band on the weekends so I can imagine it gets pretty packed. Our server Cristina was great - attentive without being over-bearing.

We started with the red sangria which was deeeelicious! Some of the best I have had in Phoenix. We got the Calypso chips to start (plantains and bean dip) - yum!! I got the Cho-Cho (vegetable curry) as an entree. It was good, not great. I like spice and this has none. It was a tad bland but didnt stop me from eating half of it. My boyfriend got the Havana Combination and LOVED it.

This place is different from the typical new age restaurants that we usually go to. That's probably why I enjoyed it so much :) 

We will definitely go back, but probably on the weekend bc I am a sucker for Cuban music!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. I love to try different cuisines and this place has encouraged me to try more cuban food. We had the cuban sampler and the pollo ajjillo. The sampler was awesome. I would give 3 stars for the other dish. You must try the flavored sodas. They are really nice and so different from what sodas we generally drink. For the dessert we tried the flan which wad heavenly."}
{"text":"Craving authentic Cuban cuisine? Well I was, and with one trip to Havana Cafe I satistied my craving. With a small and basic interior, it is far from a glamourized restaurant. However, what Havana Cafe lacks in apperance it makes up for in substance. Quality of the food, authenticity of the dishes and excellent customer service are the factors that really make this place stand out for me. 

Everything I tasted was extremely rich and packed with flavor. I ordered the ceviche, and it was AWESOME. It left an essence of piquant limes, ripe tomatoes and crisp bell peppers lingering on my tongue. I also thoroughly enjoyed their fried plantain chips with black bean dip (you've got to try it!!!!) This place serves the real Cuban deal.

The food here isn't cheap, so plan on spending a good chunk of change on your meal. Also, I'm hoping that I just visited on an off night because the mojito I ordered tasted more like a margarita as it lacked that refreshingly crisp mojito taste. It was disappointing but I'm determined to come back here and give them another chance. That way, I'll have an excuse to check out their mojito specials on Mondays!

Our server was awesome and highly attentive. The fact that they have live music is also pretty cool. Overall, this place has a lot of authentic character and that's why I'm a fan. I enjoy unique dining experiences, and Havana Cafe definitely fits that bill. So, if your looking for something different, check this place out! Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Super friendly place with a great little atmosphere.  Cute and quaint and sometimes they have live music which isn't too overbearing but it is a small place.  The first time we ate here, we were back within a week with out of town guests and have since taken several couples there.  The menu is overwhelming, it's so huge.  There is something for everyone on there.  And out of the five times I've eaten there, not one disappointment.  The food is amazing.  Be warned it's in enormous quantities!  You will take some home and you will be happy to eat it a second time no doubt.  I cannot say enough about how friendly the service is and how much they care about your experience.  I never knew cuban food was so tasty either till I tried this place.  Get a pitcher of Sangria too.   I must do if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Any Latin restaurant that uses minute rice is horrible.  Havana Cafe is one of these places.  Overpriced, rice is awful, pasteles are dry,  The one good thing is the pork.  But it doesn't warrant my going back . . . EVER"}
{"text":"Fun place. A little over priced but the portions were big. The music was amazing!!!! The fried plantains were great and the eggplant dish was the best thing on the menu. Great fun for a birthday. If you are an organic head like me then you may not dig it and bring a lot of enzymes."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVED the food.  My dinner was spot on.

So why the 2 stars?

Quite frankly, it was way over priced.  And I'm not talking about a few dollars too expensive.  For an average dinner, you'll be spending $25 to $30.  And while the food is tasty, the ambiance does not come close to warranting $30 per plate."}
{"text":"This is  not real cuban food, everything taste like it comes right out of a box. Yuck."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, the menu has changed, food is OK.  $1.95 for sour cream, REALLY???  Enough said!  I will not be back."}
{"text":"We have driven by this place before and always wanted to try it. When we saw it on Groupon, we decided, in spite of reviews, we would. GLAD WE DID...we really really liked it! 

The portions aren't huge, but we thought that it was plenty adequate. Some Americans think that if you don't get a HUGE plate of food, it's not worth it. Their food was delicious and enough for a decent meal...it was like going to someone's' house for dinner. LOVED the stuffed potato pancakes and stuffed dates. Polla Cubano was awesome, too.

We were also VERY happy with the service, Unlike other reviews, we did not experience any problems. The waiter kept coming back to refill our waters after 2 sips! We actually had 2 waiters. Now, we were there on a Monday night, but we were quite happy.

DEFINITELY WILL COME BACK. We're from Chicago, so we know good food. This was good food!!"}
{"text":"So I returned another time for dinner and was unfortunately... disappointed. I tried the mojito and it was 'ok' but not for nearly $9. Also, the dinner menu is everything on the lunch menu plus $5- $10 for each plate. 

This time I tried the Chicharonnes de Pollo and it was horribly dry. I ate one piece. My brother had a mango glazed chicken dish and it was not good either. Too sweet. 

I still love this place but just disappointed in the dinner prices and my selection. I will be going again but for lunch next time."}
{"text":"Good food, love the decor, and had a great waiter!"}
{"text":"Here is the problem with Havana Cafe:  Its overpriced.  I ordered a Emparedado Cubano sandwich as carry out.  I liked it.  It was tasty and came with french fries and moros (black beans and rice concoction).  It was supposed to come with cabbage salad but that appeared to be missing in action when I opened the box.  

It cost me $16.  

If I pay that much for a sandwich, french fries, and rice/blackbeans, they need to be amongst the most delicious things I've tasted in order to justify that.  But they weren't.  They were just barely good.  

If they cut the price in half it would be a great meal worth the price.  Until then I would avoid this place.  I wont be returning unless they do."}
{"text":"I have never written a review, but the food at Havana Cafe was so underwhelming (and not in the least bit good) that I feel compelled to share. 
I ordered the Pollo Ajillo which, in reality, was a pile of salt with a side of chicken and rice. I opted for Arroz con Gandules instead of white rice as it has been years since I have had this tasty Puerto Rican side. The whole thing was almost inedible... I came home and actually brushed my teeth immediately, it was so bad!  My husband had the Pollo Cubano, which was equally underwhelming and nothing that we could not make at home ourselves.  The restaurant gets an extra star for the wonderful Cafe Cubano and the extremely attentive wait staff .  I had high hopes for this place but the next time I have a craving for Cuban food, I will be heading to Sabor Cubano."}
{"text":"Seriously, my favorite place in the entire Valley.  Fabulous food in a casual environment.  Excellent service, great drink menu.  Every time i eat here, i rave about the food.  I usually have the Pollo Cubano.  Its simply delicious.  An entree is about $20.  And worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Over priced, plastic chairs and the food sucked!!!!!. It was like eating slop at some truck stop in the middle of know where. Come on $ 3.75 for a soda . I would not recommend this place to any one !"}
{"text":"I don't get what all the fuss is about!!!!   

I've heard great things about Havana Cafe and was really looking forward to being blown away by all the great Yelp reviews... but seriously, I won't go back.   No way, no how.

The decor was ok.   You sit in cheap plastic lawn chairs--  tres' elegante???  There are plastic banana leaf pattern table coverings with a slab of glass.  Ok... I get the Cuban direction here.  There was plenty of silk/plastic flowers to mimic the effect, but I really thought it was a little cheap and tacky.   One thing that really bothered me was how warm the temperature was.  I went during a pretty good cold spell and dressed for the weather, never expecting how uncomfortably warm it would be in there.  

The food was only ok-- good plantains, though,  and the cocktails were watered down.  My salmon dish was bland

The service was terribly slow.   

 They had a live guitarist strumming Cuban music, which was nice, but overall I fell that the place needs a serious facelift.   I saw it as an OK lunch place, but for a nice dinner out?   Never again...   

My friend and I left completely and totally underwhelmed by our experience... to the point where we were almost annoyed that we wasted a great night out."}
{"text":"Nice place. Feels great to sit out and eat. The waitress explains Caribbean  food very well  recommends the best food per your request of meat. 

Nice place for vegetarians too. Try the veggie dishes or fish. Stay clear on the chicken, It's not flavorful."}
{"text":"Three locations??  I'll have to look into that, I've been to the one on Bell and the one on Camelback and a great time was had by all on both occasions! 
I got hooked on Cuban food whilst visiting the sister in law down in Florida many years back.  I've not had a Cuban sandwich that rivals those on South Beach here in Phoenix, not like that's any big surprise...Havana Cafe is about as good as it gets in the Valley.  And thankfully they actually do a pretty good job!
Try thier paella next time, I thoroughly enjoy their version."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place after they offered a Groupon, and were so excited, after driving by it for years with curiousity. We were immediately greeted by a welcoming host, and enjoyed the intimate, family feel of the dining room. We were served complimentary bread which was delicious, and then ordered our entrees. I had the vegetarian 'cho cho' which was a halved squash full of lentils and other veggies, atop a bed of white rice with an amazing curry sauce. It was incredible!! The sauce was the best curry I've ever had. My fiance had a pork dish with rice and beans, also delicious!! It's a bit pricy but a unique experience and truly remarkable food. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"i usually get annoyed when i see people review a thai restaurant and give lower stars because neither the owners, nor customers, nor servers, nor anyone is thai. you've seen these reviews cause in my head, if the food and service are good, why should i give a shit who is serving it to me. the whole debate about authenticity is one i find annoying on several levels.

. so, first, no, i am not giving them two stars cause the guy who served us was the blondest gringo (with passable though arrogant spanish) with a haircut i don't know the name for but would describe as a mini bowl cut/possibly a shelf cut. his service was SHITTY, which definitely has something to do with the low stars. and it certainly doesn't help that i had to listen to him ask the waiter in spanish, which he assumed i didnt speak, maybe 7 times if the cheesy convertible out front was ours but then i had to listen to him talk about convertibles with another table for ten minutes. that may have something to do with the star takeway.

i actually could have heard the guitarist sing guantanemera 8 more times than listen to the waiter/possible owner talk about cars to the neighboring table. that is a big statement for me as my nipples usually invert for minimum 48 hours every time guantanemera is played anywhere within a 17 mile radius.

the most obvious reason for the 2 star rating is the food. it sucked shit. it did not taste that it was freshly cooked in any way. there was a film over teh meatball sauce that had to be broken several times for the moat of semi-warm liquid to emerge. everythin was severely underwhelming and lacked flavor.
specifically, these items, in addition to tiny meatballs in a bowl of lukewarm sauce (that the mother, bless her, was a fan of) would be...

empanadita trio (we had the beef-BLAND)

some kind of black bean ball- the only reason this place didnt get one star is that the avocado dip for said BBball was tasty. this has to do with my undying love for the avocado rather than their particular dip

spanish tortilla- the worst i think ive ever had, and i spent 5 years as a poor tortilla eater in spain and argentina in  between english teachin gigs when they came as free tapas.

the best thing here was probably the bread, they brought it warm.  our other favorite was some kind of cheese spinach thing that i would put more in the greek family. wasn't bad.
all in all, this place was, mas o menos, mierda"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I had been wanting to come here for months. The service was embarrassingly bad. Despite the empty tables, there were 3 different groups waiting at least 15
minutes to be seated. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be looking around for their waiter/waitress and looking generally displeased. We requested one of the several tables outside and were told by the surly hostess that we couldn't...because the tables were dirty (and she didn't want to clean them, presumably?). Our drink order was taken and then a clueless waiter came back to re-take it. When he returned, he'd already forgotten my drink order and had to go back the bar to make it. We then saw two of the servers get into an argument in front of us. 

Every table is supposed to get bread and we asked several people for ours when after 30 minutes, we still didn't have it. One waitress even told us, \"I'm sure it's baking right now.\" No offer to check on it, no apologies, nothing. 30 minutes and 2 cocktails later, we looked at the group of disgruntled patrons and decided we would rather take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow, are all restaurants in Phoenix closed on Monday evenings?  After getting denied from Los Sombreros, my friend and I stumbled upon Havana Cafe.  We both ordered chicken dishes: mine with onions, peppers and rice, her's in a big metal pot.  Both were generously portions (her's especially came with almost a whole chicken), reasonably tasty, but nothing special.  The tres leches dessert was pretty good, but also nothing to write home about.

They have really cheap Margarita Monday specials!"}
{"text":"South Beach Miami broke my mojito virginity years ago. So I am spoiled. Havana Cafe' has the BEST Mojito in Phoenix! And the food ain't bad either!"}
{"text":"SERVICE A+++

Food was good having not tried cuban before i have no reference.. plantain chips were great as well as the shredded chicken dishes with rice... I choose the pot roast stuffed with chorizo... wasnt exciting enough for me.   Desserts were really good!

A little expensive for what you get.. but the service was great.   And I would definately be going back!"}
{"text":"Ahh Havana Café and your wonderful Mojito's...
I have been several time, but have not reviewed, went last night and had the tapa's - Bacalaitos Frittos, Maduros, & Croquetas de Jamon.  The Bacalaitos were delish, nice crispy texture and not even the least bid fishy, people should give these a shot.  The Maduros were perfect - very sweet with just a touch of crispness.  The Croquetas were just alright, I think they need a spicy sauce or I should have added something spicy to the sauce.  The mojito was perfect, I don't think you will find a better one anywhere.  
Service - the waitress was very flustered by another customer, I think this made her forget about me, I was on the patio and alone and nobody checked on me for at least 15 minutes.  Drinks and food were very prompt after I ordered, but I would have had more if I had been checked on.  
They also did not give me happy hour pricing, but I emailed the next day and this was fixed promptly, if you go during Happy Hour at this location, just remind them.  I am sure they will fix your bill.
Overall great experience."}
{"text":"What more can I say that the other reviewers haven't already said? Havana Cafe is fantastic! I believe I may have been Cuban in a former life because I absolutely love the flavors of Cuban cooking. And, going to this restaurant somehow makes me feel like I'm right at home. The food is comforting to me -- delicious black beans & rice, unbelievably tasty maduros fritos and wonderfully scrumptious pollo cubano and chicharrones de pollo!

The atmosphere is great too.  You feel like you've escaped the desert and been transported to a cool tropical Caribbean hideaway. It's very laid back, low-key and unstuffy, yet they offer a very inviting and classy dinning experience. 

Their lunch menu is much more affordable than their dinner one, but even then the prices are decent for an awesome meal with great atmosphere. Havana Cafe will always be my favorite place to go for great Caribbean cuisine."}
{"text":"Some of the best Cuban food I've had and very reasonably priced as well! 

I can never decide between the bistecs cubano or the bacaloa (salt cod)!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently purchased a Groupon for Havana Cafe since I've been wanting to take him there for quite some time. It was a $15 groupon for $35 worth of food, a pretty good deal! We were excited. 

We sat down for an early dinner, around 6pm. Using the term greeted would be generous, so I'll just say that an older man came to our table and set 2 waters down without saying hello or how are you or anything. It's a small restaurant but there were only about 3 other tables with patrons in the restaurant. 15 minutes later he comes back with menus and asks if we want anything else to drink, I say just water for now because we had just gotten the wine menu. He proceeds to take our drink menus so I ended up just sticking with water. 

Finally, another waitress comes to take our food order. I show her the groupon to make sure it's okay to use it on that time and day (a lot of places won't let you use them during happy hour). She looks at it strangely and just walks off with it? She looked really annoyed. We got our Black Bean Fritters and Calamari appetizers. Both were so amazing. We were really blown away. For our main entree we ordered the seafood paella which was equally amazing, if not better. Although my boyfriend who has had paella on many occasions, thought it needed more saffron. I thought it was just fine. The seafood was really fresh and I think more saffron would have drowned out other flavors. 

We ordered the mini caramel flan for dessert. It came out maybe 2 minutes after we ordered it so it's by no means fresh or prepared. I thought the caramel on it was bitter and I didn't finish it. 

Overall, the food here is amazing, definitely worth going for. I was really disappointed by the service. The staff seemed to be annoyed with our groupon usage which made me feel uncomfortable. The place itself is pretty quaint and nice. It doesn't seem very popular with younger people but maybe that's because of the service."}
{"text":"A little pricey for my liking, but good nonetheless.  I really like the feel of the restaurant: part Cuban, part Puerto Rican, part Spanish, all classy.  A guitar player jammed away in a completely non-annoying way while we ate our meal and, to me, that is an accomplishment.

Our Calypso Chips were outstanding.  To die for.  One of the best appetizers I can think of at the moment.  For my entree, I ordered the Ropa Vieja which was made up of the most perfectly tender beef and tasty rice with beans.  A little heavy with the peppers, however.

Does anybody else think plantains smell like feet?  My date pointed this out and, although I was surprised, I'm inclined to agree.  That won't stop me from putting some into my stomach as soon as humanly possible."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have something different! 
We ordered the Empensdas and Black bean fritters for our appetizers ! The salsa dip with Empensdas was wonderful ! I loved  my Mojito! I had a pork and black bean dish that was really good. My hubby had a house sandwich , that came with fries and amazing black bean rice! The service was excellent and patient explaining the menu and different dishes. We loved it and will be back! 
The food was different and delicious !"}
{"text":"We have been here many times mostly for regular dining but also special events. Happy hour today was ok. House wine isn't great though it is inexpensive. The sangria was great. My wife enjoyed empanadas and the seasonal pumpkin bisque. I had sun chips and calamari. Pleasant afternoon. Service wasn't great. We were one of two tables. She could have paid better attention I suppose. We like this place and will be back."}
{"text":"The other day, had a lunch from there. 

No, didn't eat at the restraint, but we picked up a very sizable lunch for a family reunion. The lady that helped us was very gracious, and accommodating. I know, how can someone helping with take out be accommodating, because, my sister, being the wild and crazy type (and to accommodate her husband) ordered 12 Pasteles uncooked, just as raw as can be. Why, so he could freeze some for Thanksgiving. That's the Puerto Rican in him. A holiday is better when it reminds you of childhood. 

The food was excellent, the Ropa Viejo nice and tender. The Paradise Pork (I think that's what it was) was also very good. And didn't taste like a pig. (The only good part of a pig for me is the other food group: BACON!) 

And we all discovered deep fried plantains, excellante'. 

Dessert was rich, sensual, wonderful and sexy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. Interior not the best but they could of made it better by having Cuban music on or something."}
{"text":"Outstanding! A Valley Legend!

This is one of my all time favorite Valley restaurants. Great food, very warm and friendly service, and great drinks. 

Might I suggest the Pollo Cubano or the Cho Cho. The latter may be one of the best kept secrets in Arizona.

We need more restaurants like Havana!"}
{"text":"My wife and I opted for a dinner of small plates (calypso chips, datiles con chorizo, tamal cubano, empanaditas, papa rellena) and a half pitcher of red sangria.

The food very good almost across the board. The only exception was the cilantro-lime cream sauce that came with the papa rellena, which didn't really taste like lime, cilantro, or much of anything. Everything else, however, was great. The sangria was good as well, offering a nice counterpoint of sweet to our largely savory dishes. Best of all, it did not include half a pitcher of soggy fruit salad; please take note every other tapas restaurant.

Definitely worth a visit, but not if you are in a hurry; the pace is very relaxed. That does not mean service suffers, but your meal will happen at a fairly leisurely place. I will be coming back to go give some of the main courses a try, especially the cubano."}
{"text":"Their Mojitos give you awesome dreams.  I'm not kidding.  Last night, after a couple (literally, I only had two, this isn't code for I got wasted... although it usually is), I dreamt that I was in some sort of vampire army where all the guys where hot and shirtless.  Let's just say it was a good dream.  I can't guarantee you too will find yourselves in the rippling biceps of the undead if you drink their Mojitos, but it's worth a shot.

Aside from the pleasant side effects experienced later, Havana Cafe is a must try.  If not just for the fact that it's charming.  I'm not a Mojito connoisseur, so my opinion means nothing.  I will say, the second one was a bit too sour for my taste.  I need to go back and try the food to really make a judgment call, but the service was great and the one appetizer I tried was pretty tasty.  I'd probably go for the bean dip and banana chips next time, though."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here with friends from Florida. They said it was not as great as Florida Cuban food, but then again, we're in the desert, what do you expect?!?! Everyone agreed that the food was tasty, and it came out quickly. I ordered a sampler platter for dinner which had a Cuban tamale, tostones, fried pork, some vegetable croquettes and some really tasty rice and beans. I have no complaints and would go back any time to taste more of the menu."}
{"text":"I have been craving cuban food for a while.  I used to live in Tampa where we have plenty of great cuban food.  I went with a group of 15 girlfriends for a girls night out.  The food is ok.  The tostones were a little too thin and greasy.  The maduros fritos were very good, but that is hard to mess up, it is just fried ripe plantain after all.  The camarones al ajillo (garlic shrimp) were very good, you can soak a piece of cuban bread in the garlic juice. Yummy.  The mojito needed more mint. The tres leches cake was not as sweet as I am used to.  I didn't care for the chocolate dessert.  One of my girlfriends had yuca frita, which was good, of course this is another dish that is hard to mess up.  I'll be back of course, I am happy there is at least one cuban place fairly close to my house."}
{"text":"Havana Cafe is my favorite restaurant in the Valley. My fiancé LOVES the mussel appetizer--he gets it every visit. I personally am a huge fan of the gazpacho. We try different entrees and appetizers every time we go, and I have never had anything that was less than delicious. The drink and dessert menus are also very good. We love trying new food, and this is the perfect place to do it. The service is also always excellent, and I personally love the tropical feel to the restaurant. Every birthday and anniversary, this is my go-to restaurant for a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"My family and I thought the food was good enough, service was up to par, atmosphere wasn't bad (although really, you're gonna cheap out on A/C during the summer??). 

Everything was great EXCEPT the quality of the food in relation to the price. My pork sandwich should really have been priced at $8 AT BEST, not the $15 I paid for it. I ate here 19+ years ago with the same result so shame on me for going back. 

This is a great place to go for people who like to overpay for food that's just good 'nuff. 

Cheers to overpaying!"}
{"text":"When I worked in Scottsdale, I used to come here for lunch.  This place was my refuge, a cool, tranquil oasis in the desert where I could have a mini-vacation without leaving the city.  The food is fantastic--I have never had a single thing on the menu that I didn't love.  We tend to make an entire meal on appetizers.  My favorite are the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters), the Calypso Chips (crispy plantain chips with the most amazing black bean dip you ever had), and the Moros (black beans and rice cooked together.)  My partner swears by the Fried Calamari and the Albondigas soup.  Everything is prepared to order, and the service is excellent.  This is one of my favorite places to eat in the Valley."}
{"text":"UPDATED 7/15/10
I used to love this place! The food was always amazing as was the service.  It had been 6 months since I ate here so for my fathers 77th birthday I decided to take him here.  The Paella was out of this world last time...one of those dishes you never seem to forget.  Now I wish we could forget last night.  

We first ordered the potato meatball dish which was still very good.  We also ordered a tamale---no taste!

To get to the point, the food was very blan.  It seemed like the quality of the food bombed badly.  The seafood in the paella was DRY. We barely touched our food but our server didn't notice.  The busser took our food for us but on the comment card in the credit card book I put that the food was below average.  The server, who was very nice was concerned and said she would look into it...but didn't take anything off of our bill.  

Now I have been a server and bartender and I had people eat all thier food and then complain.  Not the case here...we left hungry.  sad! I won't be dining here ever again.  Not for $77



Original------
Food and service was A++.  My only complaint was the seating and chairs.  They use plastic chairs--like cheap lawn chairs.  
You must have the Cuban coffee."}
{"text":"I've been to Havana café before, but it's been at least 5 years or so. Long enough for me to forget that this place was forgettable, in my own opinion. Take that for what it is, I don't eat much Cuban food.

I was unexcited to find that Havana café didn't have any spots available to park, and the rest of the open spots in the parking lot were all labeled specifically for the next door flower shop, coffee shop, and so on. What was I to do? I risked it and parked in a flower shop spot, and well, I wasn't towed, but I still felt like I was doing something wrong by parking there :-/

Ultimately, I was lured back with a groupon they had available a few months ago. My first mistake was expecting that I could use my groupon to pay for meals which both totaled above $30 (the value of my groupon) and ALSO ordering additional items from their HH menu. I asked for two of their mojitos and was told that I couldn't order HH since I was using a groupon also. I obliged and let them know that water was just fine. My guess is they realized I wanted to buy my drinks in addition to our meals, and the waitress came back a few minutes later and told us she would put our drink order on a separate check. Nice save on their part - I was a bit miffed at first!

My second mistake was not realizing how excessively sweet their mojito was going to be. I saw at the bottom of the glass, what appeared to be a large spoonful of sugar. In this case, it didn't help the medicine go down. After them accommodating me with the drink order and all, I didn't want to make a big to do out of this, so I soldiered my way through my drink.

I ordered a shredded beef dish, and my wife a shredded/pulled pork dish. Apparently Cuban's like bell peppers and onions a heck of a lot more than I do. The peppers and onions with my dish accounted for about 3/4th's of the meal. I ate two or three slices of the peppers and a few slices of the onion, but was not satisfied with the small amount of beef the meal came with for a sticker price of $16, and even at $8 since I was paying about half with the groupon.

My third mistake was choosing to sub their house vegetables for the beans and rice. I don't eat that many carbs, so often I will exchange potatoes, fries, rice, etc for whatever vegetable is available. The waitress explained that it was a mixture of squash, zucchini, mushrooms, and a few others. In reality, it turned out to be a few slices of squash, a few slices of zucchini, a couple of mushrooms, and guess what, a bucket load of chopped bell peppers and chopped onions. They were also nice enough to charge me extra for the substitution with the meal now totaling $18 before tax and tip.

Two $6 mojito's, two $16 meals, an upcharge for the vegetables, and a $5 forgettable appetizer (I don't exactly remember what it was at this point). I was leaving with a $65 meal after tax and tip, hey, I saved $15 on the groupon though.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, I hope I made it apparent how unimpressive this spot is. Maybe you prefer pan fried peppers with a bit of beef and a side of... pan fried peppers."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST mojito I have ever tasted... and this is coming from someone that was never a fan of the drink. I ordered the lobster empanaditas and they were tasty. The sauce was perfect. I enjoyed the authentic atmosphere and live music - - it really did feel like I had been whisked away to Cuba. The service wasn't bad, but they did forget to bring a few things that were ordered - - we were a large group though so I'll be a bit forgiving. If it happened again it'd be an issue. I think everyone should take advantage of this restaurant being in the valley. It's great."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon for HC just after Christmas and decided to go back. THe one time I had been here before had just been kinda meh, but I LOVE cuban food and wanted to give it a second try. 
It was just as I remembered. Blah and bland and pretty boring. We had the plantain chips with black bean dip for an appetizer and it was quite lacking in flavor and temperature. A cold bean dip with hot chips? Weird. Next our entrees- Chicken cubano for me-the chicken was pretty good but the onions on top were kind of sweet and just didnt work for me, a person who adores onions 99.9% of the time. 
I had a glass of the red sangria which was probably the best part of the whole meal, rivaled only by the one man band providing the entertainment. I think I'm out from now on."}
{"text":"This is the best Cuban food in Arizona in my opinion. Their tostones, and bistec encevollado are always my favorite. They also make great sangrias! The only reason I am not giving this place a 5 star is because of their pricing. We always have great service and food though."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and it was YUMMY!  I had the Pumpkin Bisque soup to start and then the Combinacion de Favoritas.  Wow!  The flavors and spices were just a perfect blend of sweet and spicy.  The portion size was large, I was very full and still had some left to go.  I will definitely be coming here again.  There are lots of tasty sounding dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was very disappointed with my dining experience at Havana Cafe last night... the place smelled wonderful upon walking in and everything tasted okay (though not as fresh as I would have expected for the price), but I was thrown off-guard by the plastic chairs and frozen fishstick-resembling appetizers!

The sangria is delectable and, in the moment, I enjoyed the ceviche. However, the tapas sampler was incredibly disappointing... I've traveled throughout the Latin Caribbean and this food did not meet my expectations. 

Most importantly, though, I awoke in the middle of the night to horrible cramping, chills, and diarrhea that kept me up for hours. I have strong reason to believe this was food poisoning from the restaurant (given I didn't eat anything else last night) and I have every intention of pursuing a full refund."}
{"text":"I had lunch there the other day with some co-workers. I had the San Jaun platter, which had a variety of Puerto Rico dishes. It had such a diverse mix of flavors and I enjoyed it very much. Granted, I was so hungry at the time, I am sure that anything would have tasted incredible. 

The tables and chairs are a little jank, but I let that one slide. The waiter and wait staff were very attentive and courteous. I would love to try dinner and experience the tapas menu. 

The background latin music playing somehow makes your hips start a movin...seriously. It will happen to you."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about Havana Cafe, I was psyched to finally try it but overall I really was not impressed.  When we walked in, no one came to the host stand for about 5 minutes.  Then the hostess attempted to seat us at the worst possible table - a tiny two-seater right next to where the band was playing.  The kicker was that the table was up against a pole so we couldn't actually see the band but wouldn't have been able to hear anything else.  Needless to say, we switched to a table further back.

The first and best item I tried at Havana Cafe was the delicious caipirinha.  With so many renditions of fried plantains, fried sweet potatoes, fried yucas, etc. under Platanos and Verduras, I was having trouble deciding on an appetizer, so I asked the waitress which was the best/most popular item in that section of the menu.  She confidently pointed to the Calypso Chips.  I trusted her and then regretted it.  This is the type of thing I could see being given free, like chips and salsa, not sold for $5.50.  And they brought the entree out before the chips.

My main course was the Pollo Cubano.  The rice and beans were flavorful but a bit too salty, and the chicken was nothing special at all.  For dessert I had the chocolate chip bread pudding, which was in the form of a large, firm block that seemed like maybe it had been re-heated.


While there is the possibility that I ordered wrong, the dark, tacky atmosphere, prices, mediocre service, and loud music pretty much turned me off to this place.  The live music was decent but way too loud and we had to listen to Happy Birthday in English and Spanish three times in the hour that we were there.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, nice and simple style place, i loved it, will be back many times.

Best food i have had. 

soooo good."}
{"text":"My boys n I intentionally planned our date night at Havana Cafe.  We unfortunately found out that the Phoenix location was closed..  yes we were 5 months behind but that did not stop us.  We trekked out to the Scottsdale location. The ambiance appeared nice and all those there seemed to be happy.  The waitress was attentive- at some point she appeared a bit over the top but it seemed like she was enjoying her job-  I can't hate on that!  My son's ordered the cubano(sandwich) with Inka Cola (golden cola champagne) without a doubt a great selection.  I thought it was pricey at $16 however both ate every bit of it along with the fries & morros.  My plate on the other hand was disappointing. I got the pricey San Juan $24 plate with a variety of Puertorican food--  figured there was lots to be shared.  I would rate this plate alone as a 1.5 star as the portion & flavor were okay but nowhere near great.  The rice was good..., the flavor of the pastel was decent but the texture was weird, not smooth.  Either it was old or the masa was made in a food processor rather than the traditional manner. The pork was dry but flavorful- did not taste like the last time I had this in the Phoenix location.  The tostones were okay & the alcapurrias were good.  The two balls of mofongo was the primary reason I ordered this plate- blah... One was crumbling the other just was.  The mojo sauce was delicious- we dipped almost everything in it.  Overall the food was pricey but the live music made up for our expensive plates.  I did not consider ordering the dessert based on my entree as well as the price... cheesecake $7.50?!  Que, que?! No thanks...  I will try it again- next time I'll bring a coupon, maybe order appetizers and enjoy more of the live music.   The singer had skills..his signature ending *waoooo* was catchy."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour deals.  Great food, don't let the appearance fool you.

The ambiance of the place was sort of surprising, given the reputation and prices.  Plastic chairs?  Tiny, brightly lit dining room?  Kitschy \"CUBA!!\" pictures all over the place and a whole wall of mirrors?  It was a weird first impression.

The happy hour specials were fantastic and worth going back for alone.  We had some sort of black bean balls (fried and a little spicy) the fried yucca roots and something else I can't remember.  All yummy. 

The wife and I both had the paella and it was also great.  A really good mojito, too.

We shared the desert sampler and each had our favorites but agreed everything on the plate was delicious."}
{"text":"I love a great mojito... I lived near here so a few of us walked over one nite for mojitos.. heres the thing.. the location takes away from the place.. The bar was lively...and had it been larger..itd be a truly great place to hang.. there was salsa music and strong mojitos... Truly good cuban food... I havent been to Cuba...But it reminded me alot of Puerto Rico... where I stumbled the streets of San Juan after alot of mojitos looking for my hotel! The staff even has the accent to match:-) They are attentive... We opted to get a table because we started feeling a bit claustophobic in the bar area... it was that crowded... we had tostones... fried sweet potatoes..pasteles... arroz con pollo... a sampler plate... and then took tres leches home.. piggies we were! Worth it ...it was..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here - definitely a place I'd come back to.

I ordered the Pollo Cubano, which is citrus-marinated chicken with caramelized onions, with rice on the side. The chicken was juicy and tasty, and the rice was nice as well.

Cheesecake for dessert. This was also very good - thick sweet crust and a delicious topping."}
{"text":"This food was Horrible, very bland and dry I had the San Juan Combination. The Rice was dry no season or anthing. Puerto Rican Tamal was hard and dry it should have been moist and flavoral. Plantains was stiff as a rock and again no flavor. Mashed garlics plantains no flavor. My husband had Arroz con pollo the chicken was dry crispy and no flavor. Just save your money. This food had no Pizzazz or party in my mouth. The name sounds cool of the restaurant, but unfortunately so small and scrunched up. I would never recommend my friends or family at this place not even for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"cool place... very small... the servers were very nice and let us know what to get... we tried a few tapas but I want to go back to have a full on tapas meal...

like below the pollo cubano is great... but i would recommend getting a side of guac... that made it even better... for dessert get the Caribbean candy bar... it is a coconut flan with chocolate sauce and other yummies... between that and the Cuban coffee I would go back anytime...

one bad thing... they make you valet... even though it is free plus tip a pain in the A, since they park the car 20 feet from the door..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Due to poor service and overpriced entrees, they only get 2 stars. We ordered the black bean fritters with avocado dip, the pulled pork, the Cuban style steak and flan for dessert. It was just \"ok.\" The food alone was at least 3 stars; however, in my opinion the price was too expensive for the quality of their food. If I'm going to pay $30 for my meal, I want to at least sit on a non-patio plastic chair. 

On to the service . . . the whole time, we wished we had the other waiter. He seemed happy to work there and was so informative to his customers. Our server was more concerned about pushing us to order more food that she decided to slack on her waitressing abilities (i.e. refilling water). She would say subtle things to make us feel like we were not ordering enough, such as \"that's it! just one dessert?,\" \"any other appetizer?,\" \"are you sure you don't want a sangria?\" These weren't said with a smile either. She was worried about her tip amount, and she should be after how she treated us. Needless to say, I would have given them 1 star but the food made up for it. 

I think I'll try some place else for my Cuban fix."}
{"text":"I've been there a few time now for dinner.  its pretty much the only game in town when it comes to Caribbean food. I personally believe this place is a bit too expensive. For the life of me i cant imagine how Arroz con pollo is a $15 plate. On my last visit this past Saturday i must  say the service was in no way anywhere close to the levels they should be based on the price per plates.  The sangria had more ice than anything else and was very expensive. If my memory serves correctly it came out to $56 for two pitcher of ice.  Needless to say I'm very disappointed.  The food was ok but i actually felt gouged.   Sorry guys its been on our minds since the weekend and i felt we had to speak up.  I would also like to address the back room. I found it to have no atmosphere.  Very quite.  Lets try to remember this is a Cuban place and Cuban music and atmosphere should be present in all rooms especially on a Saturday night.. No?"}
{"text":"Arrived here around lunch time and the place was charming, but was completely empty. There wasn't even a waitress anywhere in sight. We seated ourselves and a couple minutes later the waitress came out. At first I thought why is this place so empty, but I would find out soon enough. The waitress was moody and gave us attitude when we asked her questions almost as if we were stupid for asking. We had a living social coupon and no where on it did it say that we had to order from the dinner menu, but apparently that was the case. We ordered our food, Cuban sandwich, mussels, arroz con pollo, and a salad. It was good, but not great for the prices we were paying. Just as an example the Cuban sandwich is $15...I think I paid $6 out $7 for a really good Cuban sandwich in Miami. Sad to say I probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend keeps talking about his friends from Cuba that moved away a few years ago wishing I had the opportunity to try their cooking. 

So when Groupon had a deal for this place, he scooped it up hoping it was even half as good as what he's used to. Happy to report, it was fantastic. 

I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered Sopa de Polo and Frituras de Frijoles Negros. The soup was a little on the bland side so I ended up using a lot of pepper and a dash of salt, nothing I couldn't fix. The black bean fritters were amazing! 

I can't remember what he had but he kept saying \"wow, this is good\" and \"this is exactly how I remembered\".  We will defintely be back."}
{"text":"The world's slowest service - do not go here if you are in a hurry. The food was a miss for me but I don't blame the restaurant - I had the Pollo Cubano and the flavor was really bright - not really my thing but maybe I just don't like Cuban flavors. I did enjoy the rice and beans on the side. The server was courteous but so sloooooooow - I don't see a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Solid food and service.   They took care of us even though the kitchen was about to close.  The shredded pan fried chicken and moros was great and is recommended."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The people were friendly and the service was good, but the food was bland.  Pretty small and dark inside the bar area was practically noexistent.  Nevertheless, had to try the mojito.  So-so and have had better.  Also, the food looked and tasted like cafeteria food.  If you've ever eaten in Miami or S. Florida you will sorely be disappointed with the selections here.  I left questioning whether I went on an off-night."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good! I can't wait to come back to eat some cubano! Spicy just the way I like it! Good portions too!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Havana Cafe twice, but both times it's been delicious. This is authentic Cuban served by wonderful staff. I've only been for lunch and both times it was fairly quiet. I believe the real charm to Havana Cafe will be at night when the Mojitos are flowing and the music is rocking. Can't wait to try it out."}
{"text":"Mmmm! Lunch for two here was great. We ordered several smaller plates and split it all. Every flavor was so unique. We devoured everything. The sun spots are tasty as well as the empanaditas and the tamale type thing wrapped in a banana leaf (I forgot the name). When we went, there was no one else there. Service was good. We ordered some desert also which was delicious. The decor isn't anything special, but it's not about that here- just the food!"}
{"text":"I lived in Miami for many years, so I can say this was mediocre Cuban food with some authority. Not bad, but for what you got, the price was outrageous. For that kind of money, you could do some real fine dining."}
{"text":"Being from New York, Caribbean food is always accessible.  My neighborhood there is mostly Dominican, and that's what you find more than anything else.  The southwest, logically, tends to lean heavily toward Mexican establishments.  Since I haven't been home for months, I was happy to read the reviews for Havana Cafe.

I got an order of picadillo to go.  It came with white rice, black beans, and platano maduro (Ripe plantain).  All were very good (ok, the picadillo wasn't quite as good as mine, but I'm partial to my own cooking).  My friend got a Cuban sandwich that was above average.  I thought the prices were average.  I'd definitely return to eat in the restaurant, which was comfortably decorated.  The girl who took our order was friendly and polite.  The Cuban bread she threw in for us was awesome."}
{"text":"We came for lunch. My husband had the lunch special of the jerk chicken with rice beans and a citrus slaw. It was very tasty. I had the Ropa Vieja with plantains and black beans and rice. IT was absolutely delicious. The waitress was very friendly and very attentive. Our ice teas were never less than half full and she made a point to check in frequently. We had a Groupon and everything went smoothly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pumpkin bisque is freakin delicious. Took a pint home and froze it to eat for later! Not the friendliest of service, but they def take care of you. Try a mojito too."}
{"text":"This place is small but had very clean shiny silverware and plates and I was impressed with that.

I decided to try an entree salad and picked the one that was suppose to be mango glazed chicken. It soon came out and the first thing I noticed was the greens were all WILTED and dry and warm. The greens were topped with a small (maybe two oz.) plain (not mango glazed) grilled chicken breast that was sliced and very dry. The plate was garnished with two sliced grape tomatoes and two half sliced orange sliced. The dressing was suppose to be citrus vinaigrette but it was thick and might have been the mango glaze that should have been on the chicken and certainly didn't  seem like any kind of vinaigrette. ( almost 2 stars) 

My husband had the shredded beef brisket. I tasted the brisket and it was lean for brisket but pretty much unseasoned. I didn't try the rice and beans but my husband said they were very good and well seasoned and he mixed the brisket mixture with the rice and beans and said all together that way they were good. (3 stars)

The restrooms are outside I don't know if they are air-conditioned.

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place has been a family favorite for years. We eat here at least 1-2 times per month. Very authentic, rarely crowded, and nice servers.

Food: I love the masas de puercos fritas ( fried pork nuggets kinda similar to real carnitas) when I am super hungry and I love the pargo veracruz when I want something lighters. I also love the calypso chips (fried plantain chips).
Oddly enough the bread they serve before the meal is some of the best!

Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love their eggplant dish called Berenjena con Garbanzo!  Its the best way to eat eggplant, I promise!  I tend to try to stay away from white refined foods or those with higher glycemic indexes(GI)  so I order it with extra peas, and without the white rice.  There is never a problem or an extra charge for this small change. 

My boyfriend and I have been to this location several times and always find the service OK, and the food GREAT!  We were actually once there for lunch during a power outage. Our food had just been served to our table when the power went out. They accommodated us as best they could and we were allowed to continue to dine by candlelight. This time we used a Groupon, and had no problems whatsoever, and they were friendly when accepting it but did forget at first to subtract the total from our bill, so we had to remind them. But that is not really a big deal at all, and honestly happens all the time with both Groupon and Restaurant.com certificates. 

The prices are a bit on the high side. Although, the food is really good  and authentic, so we don't mind, but would probably go more often if the prices were a bit lower. 

On Mondays they have 3 dollar mojitos, but if you purchase a shirt or hat you can get them for 3 dollars anytime! A great promotional idea!"}
{"text":"We usually go to the one on Bell Rd in N. Scottsdale but were in the area so tried this second location. I again had the Berenjena con Garbanzo, and it was again just as lovely. If your a fan of eggplant you've got to try it!

I usually order it with peas instead of rice and so expected it, but they didn't have peas so instead had the black beans on the side. It was different from how I am used to eating it but it was still very good! 

The black beans are good. It was the first time I had them so the unexpected change was good. They also didn't have the usual asparagus so brought me a little salad of cabbage and some sort of vinaigrette? It was delicious and somewhat like coleslaw but also completely unique.  Again a nice switch up from the norm. 

I agree with most of the other views that the price is a little high for the type of food, but having had my experience with Cuban food in Miami on many trips I can say its decent. So is worth it every now and again. 

Our service at this location was also great. Very attentive and lots of check in's to see how we were.

I actually think the plastic chairs lend to the \" feel\" of the place. If you have ever spent time in Little Havana or off the beaten path away from South Beach, or Lincoln Rd in Miami, you know what I mean. But I think it supposed make you feel as if your \"patio\" dining, in the tropics even inside here in AZ."}
{"text":"went for the Passover service and dinner - - a little expensive at $65 plus 20% service charge.  Good service, but the food was not very good.  Would not recommend this at all."}
{"text":"This is w/out a doubt the worst food I've had since I've been living in Phoenix.
I gave it 2 stars, because the service was great, although the constant refilling of my water was getting a bit annoying. The food is not authentic, I had the Puerto Rican combo, which none of the food on there was even worth eating, while the hubby ate some traditional Cuban food, which was traditional tasting. 

Wont be going here or recommending this place to anyone, unless they're thirsty."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this location of Havana Cafe for 20 years now. Let me start by saying I love the food. The atmosphere ( decor, tables, wallpaper, carpet, paint) has NOT been updated in all that time. 
Here I am at the end of December sitting out on an enclosed patio. I was chilly and kept my jacket on throughout lunch.  My pollo Cubans was generous with black beans and rice and a citrus sauce covering the onions and chicken breast, yes I loved it. Hubby had arroz con pollo rice with chicken that he enjoyed very much. They make a killer Mojito but I didn't realize that they were only three bucks on Monday. We paid $3.75 for an ice tea! I really don't see how they can charge that! I know that in Havana, Cuba they have not updated things due to the US boycott. But that really shouldn't effect this restaurant it's time to revamp. But don't change your recipes."}
{"text":"Amazing Cuban food. Great service. The waitress was very nice and very helpful. The food was pretty good. Tried three appetizers. I'm not a big fan of squid so I didn't like the squid as much but that's not a diss on the restaurant. I'm just not much for squid. Other than that, really great! The coffee is so good too. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to do is go hike the echo canyon side of camelback and then cruise down the hill to Havana Cafe. The best mojito in Phoenix hands down no arguments please! The black bean fritters, o my holy ****! So good! Everything on the menu here is very well done. I have a good amount of Cuban food and this is one of my all time favorite spots. Good ethnic food is hard to come by in the Southwest and this place sets a good example. Heads up ladies, This place is full of Latin charm so go with your girls and your drinks will be nice and strong!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a special night out  with your favorite person. 

My BF and I had our first date here- it has a cozy, mom and pop shop type of feel and the service was great. The servers were helpful with their recommendations. We have been here several times and each time we order something different. 

So far my favorite thing on the menu is Ropa Vieja - juicy beef in a tomato based sauce. **Mouth watering**

Any time I have visitors, I take them to this spot. If you like good Cuban food or want a pleasant and warm place for dinner and good conversation. This is it.. Happy Eating"}
{"text":"In spite of being on the corner of 44th and Camelback it does a good job of insulating you from the traffic and taking you some place else, in this case our dear Communist neighbors to the South.  I like the sampler because it allows you to enjoy the finest island interpretations of pork, beef, and chicken.  Also, no meal is complete without going bananas for the ....well, tostones.

You gotta hand it to those Castro brothers.  They forcefully preside over a country that has a pretty great national cuisine.  Viva La Revolucion!"}
{"text":"I love Havana Cafe. I lunch with my grandma here once a month. We meet up before the lunch rush, right when they open at 11:30am. The pollo cubano is all I've ever ordered. It's soooooo good that I don't feel the need to try anything else. The pollo cubano comes with black beans, rice and plantains. The carmelized onions on top of the chicken are sweet and divine."}
{"text":"I lived next to this restaurant for 15 or so years and never went. Even when my mom would ask me to because they prepared food they way her mom did when she was young... nope, that didn't get me to go. Needless to say, I'm not a super big fan of trying new foods that I know nothing about (thankfully, I'm changing on that, bare with me!)

A few years after moving away, I get a new boss at work who's from Cuba. So my work team decided to bring her to Havana Cafe. After so many years of boycotting this restaurant, I was forced to go. THANKFULLY! Who knew Cuban food could be so amazingly delicious! Now that I was \"forced\" to go once, I've been SO many more times and love it even more every time I go.

The Bistec Encebollado (thinly cut steak with onions on top) paired with Moros (black beans and rice mixed) are my absolute fave! But you can't start the meal without getting the Calypso Chips (warm plantain chips with a cold black bean dip)!

Havana Cafe is now one of my absolute favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some different cuisine, saw the Groupon, bought it and headed to the Cafe on a hot Thursday afternoon....
From the outside the place looked a lil cheap or maybe average but definitely not classy.....
I get inside and was greeted by a Wonderful lady who is the main character in the rest of the movie....
Well at the first look I though I entered a library with a forest theme...All of 'em guests were engrossed in their respective menucards.......and then I followed suite :D
Well that's the no. of options you have and cuban cuisine being foreign to most of us....you can't complain the voracious reading attitude of the guests
Well, and there comes the hostess who was glad to acknowledge my Groupon(unlike a few other places) and asked us if we had any questions.
We ordered the samplers for both the appetizers and entrees to ensure we covered it all. The hostess was kind to explain what the food was made of and included. She really was fantastic!
The best part of the place was the service and I don;t think I am doing enough justice to how courteous she was.

All in all it was an average experience with the food considering that this was our first time with cuban cuisine..(rate 3/5 for this)
However the star of the show was the service and especially the warmth of this lady who blew us away with her persona! (rate 5/5 for this)"}
{"text":"I've been to each of the three locations and I always leave even more certain that Havana Cafe has earned its spot on my top ten favorite restaurants in Phoenix list.  First time you go, go for tapas - it's a wonderful way to try a little of everything.  And if you have the opportunity to order ANYTHING that comes with banana guava ketchup, DO IT.  I typically dont even like ketchup but... wow."}
{"text":"I ran into this place by chance.  One of those \"how about we stop.. uh.. how about there\" type things.

What a surprise.

This place has a classic and high class huge wood bar.  They have huge assortment of rums and other tasteful booze to choose from.  When you order a mojito, and you really should, they'll ask you what kind of rum you would like in it.  This is a worthwhile and meaningful question.  Most of the places I've been to since just use whatever cheap crap is around, and believe you me, you can taste the difference.

The Cuban food here is exquisite.  I thought that Cuban food was mostly just like all the other Mexican trash served in Phoenix.  I was completely wrong.  You should come and see for yourself.

There is also live music here in the evenings and may be dancing on weekends."}
{"text":"This one isn't as good as the other location.
http://www.yelp.com/biz/havana-cafe-scottsdale

I screwed up and went here instead.

It was okay, but it was a hole in the wall type place and the food wasn't up to the standard of the other location.

Additionally, no decent rum selection or the larger menu of food choices available at the other location.

No need to come here really.  Go to the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Never going back!!

This was my second time here. Wasn't that impressed the first time, but thought I'll give it another look, more because one of the guys in our team really wanted to go here. 

Food: Just ok, over-priced and very small portions. Came out hungry. Deserts are quite nice
Service: I think I would have given this place 2 1/2 stars was it not for the bad service. Very rude waiter, I am not going to go into details of what happenned at our table but suffice to say I left the place pissed! Never going back and nor is the guy in our team who really wanted to go in the first place.

I think I hate a rude (and I mean rude not bad) service more that bad food. Bad food just leaves me with no feelings but a rude server leaves me pissed!"}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at the Havana Cafe.. Everybody there was super nice and the service was great... I don't think our water glasses ever got to less than 1/2 full. The food was excellent. Price-wise it was a little more than we expected, but totally worth it. The sangria and drinks were kind of pricey, but ah well. Overall a very good experience- we will be back!"}
{"text":"I ended up grabbing dinner at Havana Cafe because my first choice for dinner was closed on Sunday. Even though it wasn't my first choice, I'm glad I ate there. 

When I was looking at the menu, I saw that they still had their holiday menu up. I asked the waitress about the availability of the holiday menu and she informed me that the only thing they didn't have on the menu was the thing that I wanted the most - lechon (suckling pig). Seeing how I was already there, I was debating between the arroz con pollo or the pierna de puerco asada. I chose the pierna de pureco asada because it was probably the closest thing to the lechon on the menu. 

Now I'm not an expert on cuban cuisine, but I have enough confidence in my palate to know when something tastes good. I thought that the pork was cooked fairly well (if it was up to me, I'd like my pork a little on the rare side, but I know that this is not a very popular thing in restaurants), it tasted good and there was plenty of food. I was surprised that the black beans and rice was as good as it was. Usually I'm not a big fan of beans, but I could probably eat these everyday.

The service was superb. Our waitress was helpful answering our questions and was very friendly. 

I wish I had more room in my stomach to try more items on the menu. I'd highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place thanks to a Groupon... when we arrived we noticed the place was full but most of the tables didn't have any food on it, just drinks... and almost everyone seemed to be waiting for their food... it took so long for our server to show up that we were very close to leaving...

Food was good, service was bleh-OK...
For a place with $20+ entrees I would appreciate real chairs... 
We were already hungry when we arrived, after being seated it seemed it took like forever for our server to show up... the bread alone took more than 20 minutes... we asked for more and it took 10 more minutes, we asked for more and our server brought it sooner, it is just that she missed to drop it at our table and was chatting for like 5+minutes at a table nearby... while I knew for sure the basket on her hand was our bread. It was very frustrating.

Appetizer arrived at the same time as our food (big no-no in my book)...

On the plus side, someone else took really good care of us refiling our drinks.
Portions are big. Hubby  had the pollo ajillo (comes with white rice) and I had the Cuban dinner sampler. Hubby liked his dish, and I thought mine was good too. The pork is like carnitas, the chicken had this lemony broth that gave the rice/beans a really tasty flavor. The ropa vieja was not my favorite but was good as well.

For appetizer we had ordered the chorizo stuffed dates (datiles con chorizo)... oh well, I am yet to find out if Cuban chorizo is the same as the chorizo I know from Mexico, because I didn't taste anything other than bacon and dates. The appetizer was warm at best and am not even sure if the bacon was fully cooked. Usually for foods wrapped in bacon the bacon is really crispy and this was not the case. Of course, I am not an expert on Cuban food and even though the flavor of date and bacon was interesting, this was not exactly what we were expecting from the way the appetizer is described in the menu.

Needless to say, we won't be back..."}
{"text":"Easily the best Cuban Food I have ever had. I can't remember what my dish was called, but it was pulled pork and peppers with rice on the side. Also, they serve Pusser's Painkillers, a drink that has a special place in my heart. Anyone who has ever been to the Soggy Dollar in the British Virgin Islands will understand.

It was so good that We went there twice on our vacation. The service was great and the patio was an excellent spot to relax on a nice spring night."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious Phoenix feast, head to one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley, Havana Cafe.

I always try a little bit of everything when I'm at the Cuban restaurant, and when my pal and I went this week, our meal was no exception. We had more than 10 different menu items peppering our table, and we both left stuffed and happy. Like it is for me, Havana Cafe instantly became one of his favorite restaurants after one meal there.

One of the coolest things about Havana Cafe is that there are mojito making classes offered there periodically. I've attended one and loved it, and the mojitos at Havana Cafe are amazing. 

When we went to dinner this week, we got a pitcher of sangria instead of mojitos, because sangria is another one of my favorite drinks. The sangria at Havana Cafe is packed full of fruit flavor, and it's a really refreshing drink that goes well with the heat of the Cuban dishes.

Let's start first with my favorite dish at Havana Cafe, the Frituras de Frijoles Negros ($5.25). They're bite-sized black bean fritters served with a cool and creamy avocado dip that is to-die-for. I love, love, love this dish and could eat it all the time.

The Maduros Fritos ($5.95) are just as amazing. They're sweet chunks of bananas that make a perfect dessert or sweet appetizer accompaniment. If you don't like eating raw bananas, you'll probably still love these.

We also had vegetable empanaditas ($6.95), mini-pies chock full of veggies. For being such little appetizer treats, they're really filling and could make a great main course for vegetarians.

I also had the Potage de Frijoles Negros ($4.95 for a bowl), which is a vegetarian black bean soup that is also very hearty. It's so tasty!

My companion got the San Juan Combination ($16.95), a massive sampler plate that lets you taste seven different dishes-a Puerto Rican tamale, plantains and pork, a vegetable croquette, twice-fried plantains, peas cooked with rice and pork, fried pork and beans and rice. The dish could probably give you 2 days' worth of leftovers-and they're not gross leftovers, they're almost as good as if they'd just been served to you.

Besides the phenomenal food, I love Phoenix's Havana Cafe for its intimate setting. The restaurant is comprised of a little dining room with mirrored walls, and there's also a patio. It's not quite Cuba, but the aromas and warm, welcoming atmosphere are enough to make you feel as relaxed as you would on vacation."}
{"text":"Food was good,  service decent. Nice patio. Just drove by now looks awfully dark. Number is disconnected. Looks like the end. Sorry to see them close."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here when I first moved to Arizona almost a year ago, my date insisted on bringing me to his fav restaurant. This quaint place has lots of character and was perfect for a date; as soon as we pulled up I got excited to experience some authentic Cuban food. I started off with the red sangria, it was very tasty and not too sweet like some I've tasted. For my entree I ordered the arroz con pollo and when they brought it out I was immediately happy that I ordered it. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and the saffron rice and white asparagus were all perfectly cooked. The portions were huge, after eating a good amount at the restaurant I still had enough for a meal at home. I will be back soon enough to try some more good eats off their menu!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with colleagues.  One of my friends from here recommended it, and want to thank him for directing us here.  

I only tried the Masas de Puerco Fritas (crisp pork morsels with mojo-garlic lime sauce), which was great.  Pork was really tender, and the sauce over that was good. Beans and rice had good flavor.  They also brought a habanero salsa as I like spice, and it was really flavorful. That added to the lime sauce was great.

My friend had the Havana combo, other friend had the fish special, last friend had the combo sandwich/soup mix.  They all were very pleased, and the authenticity of the food was really nice. I didn't try them myself, but they all commented that their dishes were really awesome.

Service also stellar, water glass never empty, and brought extra sauce as needed.  5 is based on authenticity, great service, and tasty food."}
{"text":"I love cuban food! Arroz con Pollo is one of my favorite dishes and honestly Havana Cafe did not disappoint! The dish was delectable! HOwever... I hate, hate, hate when I get an amazing meal but it is ruined by yucky uncrusty cheap bread... So although I loved the food, Havana please PLEASE get some tasty crusty bread!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to Havana Cafe, follow my lead:

I can't break the delicious habit of starting with a mango rum mojito or sangria depending on my mood. 

No need to order \"dinner.\" Chose 3 tapas... I'll pick two and you can pick ONE. I pick the papa rellena ($6.50) potato croquettes about the size of a tennis ball (one for each of us) filled with ground beef and topped with a delicious lime cilantro sauce (Yes, I used the words delicious and cilantro in the same sentence! Me! The girl who HATES cilantro!!) and the black bean fritters (frituras de frijoles negres $5.25), little poppers accompanied by a scrumptious calypso avocado dip that is laced with either sour cream or cream cheese or both! The third item is your choice. 

Finish it off with a Cuban coffee (a sweetened shot of espresso) and possibly, depending on willpower or lack thereof, the Caribbean candy bar - coconut flan topped with a rum fudge sauce and toasted almonds. 

Truly, this is the best way to enjoy Havana Cafe!"}
{"text":"Definately A-ok!  We came on a Groupon.  Located in a kind of run-down strip center peopled by a bunch of punky teens, but pushed past their rude obstructions .  We entered a bright and crowded restaurant  that was gaily and cheesily decorated in a Carribean motif.  We were quickly seated at a two-top and waited on by a nice young girl, who quickly brought us our glasses of wine.  Since we aren't real familiar with Cuban food, DH and I decided to start with the appetizer platter: black bean fritters, ham croquettes and chicken croquettes, cuban tamale, chorizo and maduros, accompanied by two delicious sauces.  Omgosh, one bite was as delish as the next!  DH loved the fritters.  I enjoyed it all!  Very generous portions...we ate and ate and there was still food on the platter!  No way were we going to be able to move on to entrees----bummer!  And we hadn't spent our Groupon minimum!  Explained the problem to our server, who suggested we order a flan to go.  Great idea, and with wine, took us over the top for our Groupon.  (The flan along with the leftover appy made a great breakfast!)  We really enjoyed the flavorful  food, the excellent service and the fun and funky atmosphere.  We will so totally be back to try out the entrees.  We can ignore the juvenile delinquents to sample Havana Cafe again!"}
{"text":"Love Havana Cafe! I used to travel to Florida monthly for work and got a little spoiled (and addicted) by the great cuban food selection. HC isn't on par with some of those places, but it's darn good and it's the best Cuban food I've found in Phoenix.

The flavors are fresh and robust. Personal favorites are the Pollo Cubano (chicken marinated in citrus, onion, and lime), the Arroz con Pollo (chicken with safron rice, chorizo, and asparagus-with other yummy stuff), and the Paradise Pulled Pork (with onions, sweet peppers, and habaneros).  The Ropa Vieja and Cho Cho are good choices too, but they aren't my favorites. 

My absolute favorite thing at Havana are the Completas. These are full meals for 4 to 6 people (depending on your appetite) that are packed up and waiting for you to take home and enjoy in comfort. There are several selections (http://www.havanacafe-az.com/recipes/index.php) priced between 29.95 and 34.95. Each meal comes with your choice of entree and 
Moros (black beans & rice cooked together)
Cuban Cabbage Salad
Maduros (sweet, fried plantains)
Freshly baked Cuban Bread
Chocolate Bread or Rice Pudding

You can call anytime during the day and order up your choice with a pick up time. IT\"S FREAKIN GREAT!!!

As others have mentioned, the mojitos are fabulous and luckily for us, they have been kind enough to publish their recipe http://www.havanacafe-az.com/recipes/index.php

Service at Havana can be a little slow, but that's very true to it's cuban roots. Food is an event in this culture and is to be relished... not rushed. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the gastric ride."}
{"text":"This place is darling. The food is delicious. Service is great. We will be back. My husband had picaddillo and plantains. I had crispy chicken with black beans and rice. Everything we have ever had here is so tasty."}
{"text":"I'm sadly disappointed with Havana Cafe.  I ordered the Pollo Ajillo over steamed rice with maduros.  The chicken was over-salted and had a lot of fat.  The rice tasted like something that was microwaved.  It was as if it was a frozen meal which was then plated and heavily salted. The maduros were ok.

I could barely get thru a few bites and felt bad when the hostess asked if she could box up the rest for me and I had to decline.   I'm not one to turn away from salt.  In fact, I''ve been known to add more salt to my food for taste.  So when I couldn't even handle this plate of food, it came as quite a surprise.  I would give Havana Cafe one star but I had a very attentive hostess, so I give Havana 2 stars because of the kind service."}

Havana Cafe is a long staple of the Phoenix valley and one of those gems that every foodie needs to discover!

Unfortunately, for me the located is a little off since it doesn't look too appealing to the eye from the outside simply because of what's around it.  I think signage of the restaurant is fine.  

My partner and I ordered based on the recommendation of the server; the Sailors Paella and the Pulled Pork.  Overall, my favorite of the night had to be the Seafood dish - a mixture of crab, clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, calamari, and fish on a saffron rice.  The pot came out nice and warm and my first bite reminded me of some homemade meal with love!  I wasn't too crazy about the Pulled Pork, but not to say it wasn't good.  Cooked with Habenero peppers and bell peppers this dish had some pop!

In the end, the service here was surprisingly very good and on top of things.  Very knowledgeable and my water was filled at all times.  The ambiance might need a little spruce up.  I'm no decor expert by any means, but I didn't care for the fake plants and the furniture was lawn chairs.  I've never been to Cuba, but if that's the idea then I would definitely have a makeover to capture the American style and flare. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decided to finally check this place out after driving past the Camelback location a bazillion times. After discovering their living social deal, I had no excuse. Welp, a few days after purchasing it I get an email the Camelback location was closed. This was a bummer since I don't live as close to the Bell location but decided to give it a shot. 

The black bean fritters and dinner sampler hit the spot to have a taste of what they have to offer. Despite waiting FOREVER for the food, everything was hot and delicious. The server and overall experience was pleasant. Will probably be back."}
{"text":"Best Maduros Fritos!"}
{"text":"This place has turned me off of Cuban food. Terrible decor, old, hot, not enough air conditioning I guess and the Paella..please. Over cooked, smooshy, cold vegetables, almost all rice with no saffron favor ands terrible seafood...can't even get the crab out of crab legs because they are so soft and cold. Terrible. I hope this place goes out of business because at these prices...I wouldn't normally say that but...shame on you for serving this. These other reviews are from the staff, no doubt about it. Try it and then thank me,later for warning you."}
{"text":"This tiny, unpretentious Cuban restaurant is hidden away in one of the area's many strip malls. There are a number of items ideal to share as starters, including tostones, twice-fried green plantains served with a garlic dipping sauce, and croquetas de jamon o pollo, minced ham or chicken croquettes served with a pimento aioli. Most of the entrees are served with rich black beans and rice, and you can't go wrong with either pollo Cubano, a boneless breast of chicken marinated with lime, orange and garlic and sauteed with sweet onions, or the bistec empanisado, a slender steak marinated in lime, garlic and spices, lightly breaded, and pan-fried. The portions are huge, so bring home a doggie bag for a nosh later in the night."}
{"text":"We have loved Havana for over 20 years, first at Camelback location, then in Ahwatukee for a short time, and now in Scottsdale. Food is always excellent! Love the black bean fritters and shrimp pancakes - must haves! Absolutely deadly good sangria. They sneak up on you."}
{"text":"We tried Havana Cafe last night for the first time... 
Without mojitos or sangria, perhaps we didn't get the full experience, so I'll have to return for those and sit inside next time too.  But it was a beautiful night, so our party chose outside instead.  

Irma was our server (see Robert M's review).  She was fabulous.  We started with a variety of empanadas and the black bean fritters.  I was not a fan of the 'calypso avocado dip' that comes on the side of the fritters - it reminded me of store bought guacamole that is so creamy, it doesn't even taste like avocado.  The fritters themselves were alright and same with the empanadas.  Next course was chorizo, fish of the day (halibut), and sides of yucca con mojo and asparagus.  

I'm a huge yucca fan, so it's always a treat for me when I go to a Cuban restaurant... and it delivered at Havana!  Yum... gotta love that interesting texture!

All in all a pleasant experience - I will return with a larger party sometime for the real deal!  Thanks again to Irma for taking good care of us!"}
{"text":"We come to AZ once a year from California. Havana Cafe is one of our key destinations, and we try to eat here multiple times during our vacation.  The food is to die for!  Great selection of very authentic Cuban food.  Plantains are amazing. Don't miss this restaurant. Yes, the plastic chairs could be upgraded to more comfortable chairs:-)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly one one my favorites. I have never been disappointed with the food, service or atmosphere. 

Try the Havana combination and add meat, or The Paradise pulled pork and wash it down with an Iron Beer. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time trying Cuban food, so that was fun to try something new.  Other than that, there was nothing to really rave about.  The wait staff did not seem thrilled to be there, people had little kids acting up in the tiny restaurant and the tables are on top of each other, so cell phone conversations took away from the experience too.  Not sure I would go again, but glad we finally gave it a try."}
{"text":"Last night I introduced my friends to my fiancé. It took me a long time to decide on the perfect restaurant for us all to get together for some wonderful food and drinks. I remembered going to Havana Cafe before and enjoyed it quite a bit, so finally decided that would be the spot. Sadly, this time around it wasn't very impressive. My drinks were verrrrrry weak, my food was not flavorful or even displayed in an appetizing manner. The appetizers and dessert were good, but not amazing. I'm not sure why last night was different, but it was different enough to ensure that I probably won't return. That makes me sad."}
{"text":"Max Fischer: What was your major?

Rosemary Cross: I didn't have a major, but my thesis was on Latin American economic policy.

Max Fischer: Oh, that's interesting. Did you hear that they're not going to teach Latin anymore?

Rosemary Cross: This was more like Central America. 

Ha.  Okay.  That exchange doesn't have anything to do with my review of Havana Cafe, only that it dances with the South-of-the-Equator theme.  Which, in actuality, is the same concept of Havana Cafe.  That is, its a Cuban restaurant with heavy Latin American themes. 

First, and I must emphasize, FOREMOST, their alcohol selection is nothing short of brilliant.  They import an enormous amount of South American and European-cum-Latin influenced wines and serve it both by the ounce and the liter.  Fascinatingly, they have Portuguese reds, which i have been exhaustively looking for, either in-store or dine-in around the valley.  Praise be, I've finally found the place!  They also offer Argentine reds and whites, Chileans Sav Blancs, and Spanish Tempranillos.  Perfect selection, and VERY reasonable for their exclusivity.  Their Douro was a serf-encouraging $8.  That's not very many Escudos, no not at all.

For beer, they had several unique selections, most notably the inclusion of Argentina's Quilmes.  Honestly, i cannot remember what other selections they had, though i remember being roused by the list, only to be seduced by the Porteno brew of choice.

Their selection of rums, and the accompanying list of rum cocktails was also impressive, though sadly sans Havana Club Rum due to America's archaic embargo vs the snarky nation of Cuba.  Blast.

When the food came out, I was impressed by the presentation.  To start, my gf found it in her gullet to order the hearts of palm/carrot/various rabbit food appetizer, which was heavily drowned in vinegar.  i liked it, but she didn't care for it all too much.  My app was the serving of 3 croquetas filled with ham with a side of mildly spicy aioli.  Not bad, but slightly mushy.  Fry them up a couple more minutes and I would have gladly accosted my taste buds with volcanic pork pieces even further.

My entree was the poached chicken with shrimp and rice, which tasted well and good on the first try, but went up to 11 on the re-heat the next day.  Fucking glorious.  My gf had the stuffed squash with a Jamaican curry cream sauce.  She was thrilled with it because she likes vegetables and shit, and this was the motherload of veggie heaven -- veggies filling veggies like some plant orgy.

Okay, so why the empty star?  

Its pricey.  What was meant to be a casz dinner ended up surpassing the century mark.  Not a problem really, since we got 2 rounds of the good stuff, plus basically dinner/lunch out of it, but it COULD turn some people off.  All in all, i felt it was slightly over-valued. 

Still, this will NOT keep me from coming back.  There is just too much fucking potential here and so many unfurled selections. I've gotta take down their wine list.  I wonder if they offer an around-the-world-wine-club card like some cheesedick chain like The Yard House.  I will be here for as many happy hours and apps as is necessary to finance the country of Cuba and bypass any restrictions put onto me by the governments.  Go here and do your part too."}
{"text":"The fiancé and I go here regularly.  Cuban food holds a special place in my heart and when the embargo is finally lifted, I will be the first person on a plane to Havana!  I always try to get a different dish when I go there, but I always make sure that I get a mojito, a Cuban coffee, and the  bread pudding.

Meal: If you are new to Cuban, stick with the staple rice and chicken.  You can't go wrong.  And anything with rum.  But whatever you do, end the meal with a Cuban coffee and bread pudding.  The bread pudding here is the best in Arizona.

Taste:  So this isn't the best Cuban food that I have ever had.  It doesn't really push the envelope when it comes to seasoning or unique ingredients.  But that's ok!  It does the simple things very well.  I have never had a bad meal at this place and on occasion, I have had that type of meal where you think about it on the way home! 9 out of 10.

Value:  I spend way too much here.  I rarely get booze and dessert in the same meal at other restaurants, but its a given that I will get both when I go here.  My bill is always pretty big so its hard for me to really comment about value.  But what I do know is that I never walk away hungry and I never felt let down after I get the bill.  4 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  Service is always great.  The servers are always warm, friendly, and attentive.  They aren't presumptuous. Very helpful and their recommendations are always spot on. 9 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  Decor is cheesy and the lawn chairs aren't comfortable.  But that is what kind of adds to the charm of the place.  They have live music every once in a while and during the spring, you can sit out on the patio and look at the stars while drinking mojitos.  To me, it doesn't get much better than that when dining in Phoenix. 5 out of 5.

Overall:  If you haven't been here, make it happen this weekend.  This place is a nice break from the pace of eating Mexican 24/7. Weekends and happy hours are the best time to go.   27 out of 30 points, 5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to send a shout-out to Irma, our server who has given me hope that there are caring hospitable people in the food industry.  Irma receives 5 stars for taking good care of me and my sweetheart during our recent date at the Havana Cafe. Way to go Irma!

We step into a well packed restaurant on a Friday night with plans to try the Sailor's Paella Special and a few cocktails. We wait for just a few seconds until we are greeted by Irma and her warm smile and are led to our table. Our cocktail orders are taken immediately, 1 Mojito and 1 White Sangria. Both exceeded our expectations and were just thing to get our date started.

The ambiance is whimsical and charming - Reminded me of the movie \"The Bird Cage\" without the drag queens and dramatic dialogue. Bummer!

Now on to the Paella. It was the perfect dish for the evening offering plenty of shrimp, calamari, crab, scallops, muscles, tuna and a healthy serving of saffron rice. This meal also requires a little handy work to get to the crab and muscles but you are given the proper instruments to do so. This may not be the best choice for those who do not enjoy this kind of food activity but we had a lot of fun with it.  We will be back soon to try another interactive meal and partake of a round or two of Mojitos. 

So if you are in the mood for something different, fun, and oh so delicioso, I recommend you try a night out at the Havana Cafe. I also hope you have the pleasure of meeting a groovy gal who goes by the name Irma."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place isn't better-reviewed. Have probably been here a dozen times and never had an item I didn't like. Starters are always fab -- wonderful black bean and chicken soups, kids love the plantain chips and black bean dipping sauce. I would go here just for the bacon-wrapped chorizo-stuffed dates. Meaty, salty, sweet luscious goodness? Yes, please. They do a wonderful (and HUGE) arroz con pollo, and their caribbean chicken with black beans and rice is also to die for.  Friendly service, nice location, Havana Cafe is always a winner."}
{"text":"Okay so last night 6 of us came here for dinner. Its the 3rd time I have been to this location. The first time I thought it was AMAZING. Couldnt get enough of it. 2nd time was \"ok\", my drink (Pussy's Pain Killer) tasted off, not like the first visit and the food was somewhat bland. Chalked it off to being an off night. So last night I ordered a dish I had at the Bell Rd location which was phenomenal-Gallina Fritta. Last night it was almost dry, bland, you couldnt even taste the garlic or lime. So disappointing. My Pussy's Pain Killer tasted better but not even close to the \"wow\" factor the first time I had it. For this I dont think I will ever return, its far from consistent and has changed from \"Amazing\" to \"meh\" in 3 years time. Its time to find a new Cuban/Puerto Rican restaurant to get my fix.

As for the service..our server was extremely pleasant but scattered. He took appetizer orders from 4 of us and completely forgot to ask the other 2 at the table! Then the same 2.. their food entrees didnt even come out within 5 minutes of the rest of us.?? It is not a big restaurant and we were not a big party, so there was no reason for the service to be sub par.

In the poetic stylings of Guns -n-Roses.\" I used to love her...ooh yeah.. but I had to kill her\"..is my final word on this place."}
{"text":"I am struggling with my experience here yesterday.  I was so excited to reconnect with some exquisite and succulent Cuban food. I was not so fortunate during this visit. My friend had the

Ropa Vieja plate: shredded beef brisket, bell peppers, onions, tomato wine sauce, moros 17.95 had I the 
Pollo Ajillo plate: boneless chicken breast sautéed with mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, garlic, sherry, white rice 14.95

Both plates were very simple in the presentation and came accompanied with rice. The consistency of the meat was so watery that it completely spoiled the rice. For a moment thought I was eating a rice soup with chunks of meat.

This location is very dated and the ambiance was not entirely pleasant and to make things even more uncomfortable, the restrooms are outside in the backyard. Needless to say, I will not likely be coming back anytime soon. It took me 8 years to come back and now I remember why I avoided it for so long.

My friend was ok with it and the avocado salad looked delicious and my friend liked it. Our server was also friendly"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. The plantain fry reminded me so much about the ones we get back in my home state of Kerala, India. The other entrees were good. The food is not spicy, but if you prefer spicy food they will bring along a spicy sauce if you ask."}
{"text":"Still as good as I remembered! 

This visit around I tried the following:
Alcapurrias (Picadillo stuffed croquette made from tropical vegetable masa)
Tostones (Twice-fried green plantains)
Arroz con Gandules (Pigeon peas cooked with rice, pork, olives and capers)
Mofongo (Crushed plantains and pork cracklings)
Sangria made with Red wine
Cortadito (Café Cubano laced with steamed milk)

Between the Tostones & the Calypso chips, I prefer the Calypso chips. 
The Arroz con Gandules is very good, you can really taste the saltiness of the capers.
The Mofongo were my absolute FAVORITES :D  They are very basic, but who needs more?!
As far as the Cortadito goes, I'm pretty sure that I could feel my pupils dilating as I was drinking the tiny cup down, lol. If this is a diluted Cuban Coffee, I'm not sure I'm ready for the real deal! Even though it was strong, or perhaps because it was so strong, I feel like I'm hooked! :) 

Word of warning, if you don't like garlic, you need to really consider your choices. I don't think there are many dishes made without the use of garlic."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant twice now. The first go-round was due to a Groupon that we purchased in order to try out new places in our area. The more recent time was within the past week and I have to say that the second trip was more memorable than the first.  

The first trip we decided to order our own dishes and have some Sangria. Everything was tasty, service was good, and the place has a fun ambiance to it with a porch / patio like feel but indoors. This second trip we had the better idea of sharing the tapas sampler plate and adding on a meatball tapas plate. 

The sampler comes with a great mix of the individual tapas plates they offer and gives you the chance to try a whole bunch of items all at once and really determine what you enjoy and what you don't, so you'll be better informed on future visits. The meatballs were a great addition to this plate and would have been a great option in general!

Our server was very friendly and checked back in on us regularly to ensure we were doing well. The food came out pretty quickly and it was easy to sit and enjoy the place while we waited.

Overall: A
Order the tapas sampler plate - if you're super hungry, add another small tapas plate. Get some Sangria. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise - to find an authentic Cuban restaurant in the state of Arizona!!!!  I had the typical beef plate with rice and beans and maduros.  I've been thinking about the maduros all week long!!!! Pretty standard Cuban food and it was excellent.  It lead me to ask the waitress where the owners are from - one is from New York and the other Cuba which is why the food is really really authentic.  We topped the food off with a really good pitcher of sangria while a Cuban band played live Cuban music in front of us.  For me, this was a 4 star night.  This is a very casual place  My only complaint is that it is sort of pricey.  Two entrees, a half pitcher of sangria and 2 appetizers was over $80.   We'll absolutely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"When you go: try the black bean fritters with avocado dipping sauce---SOOOO GOOD...i could've eaten those for my whole lunch!

Then, my friend and I shared two different dishes: 
the Cuban sandwich (like a panini), which came with the black bean soup and a pork dish that was marinated in lime juice and spices.

Both dishes were really good! i would definitely go back, because EVERYTHING on the menu looked tasty. i wanted to try it all, but alas, my stomach and wallet are only so big."}
{"text":"A party of four entered a small \"Cuban Cafe\" settled in between a dying strip mall. The wait service was below average. The mojitos were above average. The seafood was cooked well. But was it extremely memorable? No.

The dessert sampler were pretty good for the price. But if I was in Arizona again, I'd pass on this place."}
{"text":"Havana Cafe

Food: Nyah
Atmosphere: Good 
Mojitos: Excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been to each of the three locations of Havana Cafe and have never been disappointed. The food is always delicious and I had the best mojitos I've ever had at Havana Cafe. 
It can be a bit pricey, but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"All I needed to complete my delicious meal here was a good Cuban cigar and some brandy!

We had the Papa Rellena for an appetizer... very very good. Its a beef filled potato cake with a cilantro lime sauce.

For entrees my wife and I shared two dishes... the Ropa Viejas (shredded beef brisket in a tomato wine sauce) and the Gallina Frita (crispy fried shredded chicken, onions, in a mojo garlic lime sauce....amazing!

Both dishes were large...with tons of meat.

Great service and really good mojitos make for a nice evening out at the Havana Cafe.

For dessert we indulged on the \"Best Of Phoenix\" (Phoenix New Times) Caramel Flan.... OMG!!!! And the coffee was yummy too! 

We also found a 15% coupon in DineInAz.com.... saved us almost $7!

As the sign over the door says... \"Cha Cha Cha!\""}
{"text":"Let me say this about Havana Cafe: the service was excellent. I have no complaints here. Staff was friendly and attentive.

The entrees, however, was average and even sub-par for the price. For as much as it all cost, I expect my tongue to salivate for the next bite; mine didn't. It was merely alright. Desserts fared a little better: the coconut flan was to DIE!"}
{"text":"This place is highly overpriced and over the top. The food was decent, yet indecently priced. If you are going to charge me $15+ for an entree, then don't seat me in a plastic chair that was procured no less than twenty years ago. Maybe it's part of the \"charm,\" but I wasn't impressed, and I will not return unless the prices on the menu fall to fares that fit the flare. 

For the appetizer, I ordered the beef empanadas. Having traveled to Argentina, I know a good empanada. Havana's meat filled pasty left something to be desired - not enough spice and too greasy. 

For the entrees, I ordered the fried chicken and the paradise pulled pork. Both came with black beans and rice. The beans were good - blended with onions and cilantro. The rice was as plain as Jane. I found the chicken to be quite good. I liked the corn starch dusted coating and the overall flavor and moistness of the chicken. The paradise pulled pork was mediocre, at best. While the price was jacked to the max, the portion sure was not. I've had better tasting carnitas for half as much. 

I love when a restaurant leaves me excited to come back and try some more, and sadly Havana Cafe has not done that for me."}
{"text":"Went back here a couple weeks ago.

Ordered the Yuca Frita (fried cassava root) kind of like a french fry but way better and the Fried Sweet Potato chips both served with Banana Guava Ketchup (see pics)

WOW! That sauce is incredibly tasty and the sweet potatoes were sliced so thin they were the best I've had!

Also decided to share the San Juan Combination Platter to Sample the special flavors of Puerto Rico which was :

Pastele (Puerto Rican tamale),
Mofongo (Crushed plantains and pork cracklings),
 Alcapurrias (Picadillo stuffed croquette made from tropical vegetable masa), 
Tostones (Twice fried green plantains), 
Arroz con Gandules (Pigeon peas cooked with rice, pork, olives and capers), 
Masasde Puerco Fritas (Marinated fresh pork pieces fried to a golden brown).
Served with mojo. 

I was not crazy about this platter..mostly greasy, and too much meat stuff, go figure the vegetarian would pick this!
 The best part was the fried pork pieces which surprisingly were not greasy at all.

Next time Im getting a salad!

You really need to go here with a large group ..hint..hint..YELP EVENT!!

The menu s so big and they give you so much, to really enjoy it all you need plenty of people to share with."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and just not written a review for this location. 

Last time was great everything we ordered was delicious and fresh, this time not so much, at least as my food was concerned. 

On a recent rip to California I visited a Cuban bakery and cafe where I had the most amazing potato balls, that's what they call them there, a mashed potato croquet slightly larger than a golf ball, filled with seasoned ground beef and flash fried and Oh SO Amazing and only .80cents each! WHAT! ;-) 

So when I saw Christina's review describing these fabulous treats I wondered how I over looked them and decided to make my way over to Havana. 

I have to say I was extremely disappointed, 2 golf ball sized, dried out potato balls for $6.50! (see pics)
They were not even edible in my opinion.  
I asked the waiter to take them away.

I also ordered the calamari (see pics)which I was not happy with either but since someone in my party kept eating it, it was a little hard to send back. 
It was very heavy if that makes sense, the crust was so thick and I though it was a tad rubbery but what turned me off the most was the grayish greenish color...........I wasn't going to eat these either."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We came here for our anniversary and shared a huge plate of 3 different dishes along with appetizers, drinks, and dessert. First off, the mojitos are good, but a tad bit sweet for my taste. One was all I could handle. The Sangria was right on the mark, down to the thinly sliced apple pieces in it, yum! Every food choice we sampled here was better than the last. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We used a Groupon and at first they didn't want to honor it, since it was Valentine's Day, but after I asked a second time, they went ahead. I would definitley recommend to anyone looking for authentic cuban food! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"If you want to have a lovely little evening I recommend Havana Cafe. It's a little bit different (for me at least) so it's nice to try new things. Plus it's really tasty. They have mojitos there that are to die for - not your standard \"mix\" drink, a REAL mojito.  There was live music the night I went which was great. It was just one of those meals where you could take your time and enjoy the whole experience. Totally recommend it.

It's only spendy because you want to do it up - appetizers, drinks, meals, desert, coffee...all together it adds up but the meals themselves aren't outrageous."}
{"text":"6 of us mostly had a very enjoyable meal (one had an overly breaded/deep fried fish which didn't sit well) in celebration of a recent holiday.  Smorgasbord of an appetizer is a great idea to maybe help you make up your mind as to what to get for dinner.  Special mojitos from the bar were very worthwhile.  Owners/staff are very attentive and always seem to remember our names."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE the food at Havana Cafe but we must say, the service stinks. We went there last month on a Saturday night with no reservation.  We didn't mind waiting and was told it would be about a 20 minute wait.  After waiting quite a while we noticed there were about 6 tables opened.  We asked why we weren't being seated after 40 minutes and obviously there were open tables and we were first told they were for people with reservations and then were told they didn't have enough wait staff.  The owner or whoever that was (not) helping us, didn't seem too concerned that we were a bit ticked off about this.  Once we were seated, the service was painfully slow but the food makes up for it.  

Our next experience was not much better.  This time we had a reservation and was seated right away.  After 25 minutes and bugging the hostess twice (WHO OBVIOUSLY DIDN\"T SEEM TO CARE AT ALL THAT WE WERE WAITING)  we finally had a waitress greet us and take our drink order.  THe waitress told us  this was not her station but would be glad to help.  This was Korina and she was WONDERFUL.  The food was great.  I enjoy the Pollo Cubana and my husband gets the Sailors Paella.  

It just seems as though the staff (expect Korina)  doesn't really seem to care.  That they are busy enough and we must eat there on their terms.  Just a vibe we get there.

The drinks are incredibly small and a bit of a rip off but I was impressed that they had the Caribbean drink called the PAINKILLER.  

Also, WHY the plastic chairs???  That place is so popular and so busy that I'm sure they can afford to upgrade to anything but a lawn chair.  

We will go back....we always do...but we are hoping that someone from there reads this and takes this as constructive criticism."}
{"text":"My sister and I came just because we read about this cafe having plantain chips, which we were craving. That being said, we can't speak for any other food, but these chips were so amazing, we had to get a second order. The black bean dip that came with it was especially tasty, and my sister, who doesn't like black beans at all, helped me eat it down to the bottom of the bowl.

We were a little put off by the stale, quiet atmosphere and lack of music. We were two of four in the small dining area and felt uncomfortable having conversation when the others could hear every word. 

The only other thing that made our visit less than perfect was our waiter. He was really attentive to our needs (water, whether we needed anything else every once in a while, etc.), but standoffish/unfriendly for the most part.

Bottom line, I will be back again with an emptier stomach so I can enjoy the crunchy plantain chips, and try other delicious looking dishes here."}
{"text":"Growing up in Phoenix, I used to love Havana Cafe. I had birthday dinners here several times. This week, my Dad proposed that we revisit Havana Cafe to celebrate my Master's.

When we arrived at 5:30 on a Tuesday, we were one of three tables in the restaurant. The server (there was only one) kept our waters refilled, but it took 25 minutes to have our orders taken. We ordered maduros and black bean fritters to start. The maduros were heavenly, but it is hard to go wrong with a fried plantain. The black bean fritters were... not what I remembered. It may have just been a bad batch, but ours were suspiciously liquid on the inside. 

For entree, I ordered Camarones Havana, my Dad had the Cuban sandwich, and my stepmom got a special: several pieces of pork with black beans and rice, yucca root, and more maduros. Dad loved the Cuban sandwich, stepmom seemed to enjoy the pork, but not much of the sides. We had to add a lot of salt to our food when it arrived, I don't think there was any added in the kitchen. 

I was disappointed with my ($22) Camarones Havana. I received no sides, and the plate was just bland. It became marginally better with salt, but still. Where's the flavor? I ended up eating black beans and rice off my parents' plates. 

By the time we left, the restaurant was mostly full inside, with a few people sitting outside. Because there was only one server, it took us another 20 minutes to get boxes and our check. 

Sad to say I don't think I'll be back, unless it's to order some maduros to go."}
{"text":"Cuban food is not very plentiful in Phoenix, but Havana Cafe does a very good job of making it accessible, tasty, and fun.  If you're not sure what Cuban food is, think of a Spanish and Mexican hybrid.  The seafood paella is delicious and a stand out, but everything I've tried on the menu is at least above average.  The food is always consistent and the staff and atmosphere usually have a friendly vibe.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"One word to describe this place? Cute. Another? Tasty.

The BFF and I visited Havana Cafe for the first time and hopefully not the last. We went for lunch on a Saturday so it wasn't very busy. The place is pretty small (and cute!) but there are many tables inside and out. They had festive Cuban music playing which added to the atmosphere.

Since neither of us know much about Cuban food we decided to go with the tapas sampler. Perfect for two people, it was loaded with 6 of their tapas. I'll murder the names, but there were plantains, chorizo, a tamale, black bean fritters, cod fritters and one other meat item I can't remember the name of. We also got a side of Sun Chips (sweet potato fries) and a half pitcher of red sangria because that's how we ladies roll for Saturday lunch.

Everything in the sampler was delicious. My favorites were the plantains, the black bean fritters and the tamale but I really did like it all. The sweet potato fries were good but I've had better. That's the only thing I probably wouldn't order again. Nothing in the sampler was spicy so it's a good option for just about anyone, except vegetarians.

The sangria was good, more wine tasting than some sangrias. i'd like to try the white sangria next time.

The service was great. Everyone was friendly and they didn't try to speed us along or anything as we took our time chatting and munching.

They have a pretty extensive menu so I'm looking forward to going back and trying a few more things next time."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant, very cramped, but I feel like that is how it should be.  On a hot day, I almost feel like I am in Cuba.  They have a diverse menu, so you are sure to find something for everyone.  This doesn't seem like the ideal place to have a dinner date, but so far I have only had hits with this place.  Everyone I've taken here has loved that food and commented on how cute the restaurant is.  Mmmm...thinking about croquettes is making me crave some Havana Cafe."}
{"text":"This place is a huge dissapoinment. You look at the menu and you get excited thinking. Oh this is going to be good!!!  Then the food comes and is wrong. Very wrong. 

The rice is wet and salty. Too much cilantro all over the place. This is not Mexican is Cuban. Yes we use cilantro on our food but not to that level. 

Rice should not be soup.  Bad cooking period."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Pretty small place but who cares cuz they make up for it with their great service and the food is excellent. I get cravings for their authentic food, I love the Pollo Cubano. Look forward to going here every time I visit the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Great food! Got a coupon off Groupon to try this place - yummy is all I can say...delicious food with a menu with something for everyone. Had the fried plantains and bean dip as appetizer - great change of pace from chips and salsa. The main courses were phenomenal and the rice pudding was the best ever. Try it!!! Little pr icy but very good and unique food - wonderful wonderful service!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I tried my wife's dish because I wasn't having a great introduction to this restaurant and it was somewhere down in 1.5 to 2* territory. It's easy to get carried away in a sea of red stars sometimes but maybe 2 mojitos or more carry the reviews skyward? :)  

Actually the  drink/ appetizer part was really nice  Mojitos, chorizo and maduros. Appetizers aren't gargantuan,usually a good thing,and are good value. I could see us coming back for just these. The mojito was not as good as  those made by a co-worker who'd attended the classes they run here, weird;) but still pretty serviceable. 

The Rabo Encendido ( oxtail stew) I ordered  could have come from England it was that bland  the shopping list of spices that most recipes have in common for this had taken Labour day off.  really it was boiled meat on white rice with nothing other than the maduros providing the taste. I borrowed some of the sauce from the other dish to finish it as well as the amazingly tasteful black beans that accompanied her dish so it's not like they can't cook, just not consistently.     2.5  rounded up to 3."}
{"text":"My wife & I tried this place for the 1st time last night- and LOVED it.  Black bean dip is a good starter, but we'll try something else next time.  My wife had arroz con pollo and really liked it but bowl was so large she brought some home.  I had the crispy pork pieces with black beans and rice and it was fantastic. We also drank a mojito (was OK) and the peach drink X2.  Well worth it.  But it want just great food, Luis our server WS outstanding - one of the most attentive server we've had while eating out recently.  We'll be back next week and asking for Luis!"}
{"text":"Delicioso!

We have been going to Havana Cafe for years. It has been consistently a good experience. Good service and good food.

Dinner itself is always yummy. I always order the ChoCho. Stuffed squash with a mouthwatering curry sauce. Soooo good. My husband has something different every time, usually seafood or pork. He is never disappointed. Last time we went we split a bowl of pumpkin curry soup. OMG! I usually hate pumpkin but this was incredible!

My only complaint is the price for the portion they serve. Don't get me wrong, it is super yummy. But vegetarian entrees run between 15-20 and meat and seafood are usually over 20. They don't include any salad, soup, or bread and the portions are rather small. 

What we do more often than dinner is happy hour. Tapas are very inexpensive and absolutely delicious. Black bean fritters, sun chips, Spanish tortilla. Yum. Mojitos and sangria are on special too. Both drinks are really good. Havana Cafe is the ONLY restaurant in Arizona where I like the sangria. The bartender is nice and we usually have the bar to ourselves... what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here with a friend on a whim. I kept seeing groupons for it (which I didn't get), and decided...why the heck not. 

Very nice decor, reminded me of some of the places I visited in Florida. Immediately seated, very friendly waitress!

We started with the 1lb of steamed mussels, which were very tasty! The broth was great for dipping the bread in.  Pretty great price, honestly. 

Then...I we shared a cup of the pumpkin soup, which is seasonal. Holy moly was it good. Creamy, pumpkiny, a little spicy. The more you ate, the more you wanted it. I could easily do a whole bowl of that with some bread and call it a night! The waitress said people would call in August for it...but it's only available now, and it goes quickly. I can see why.

I had to be cliche and have the cuban sandwhich, which was very good. Side of black beans and rice with fries, nothing to complain about!

Friend had the Chicharrones de Pollo (fried chicken). Pretty basic friend chicken dish made with masa rather than traditional friend chicken batter. Interesting flavor, very juicy, quite good. 

Washed it down with some negro modelos, and we were good to go. 

If I had any con to add, it would be that it was a bit pricey. For most items, if the prices were about 40% cheaper, they would be a better value. But, it is what it is."}
{"text":"At the service person's strong recommendation, we ordered the most expensive dish on the menu, Paella de Havana and a combination of their popular tapas plate while we waited for the paella(45 minutes).  The tapas and the mojitos were delicious.  They really got my hope up for the highly recommended paella yet to come.  Boy, were we disappointed!!!! The paella had lobster, clam, mussel, chicken, shrimp, chorizo.  Sounds good?!  The rice was mushy and very salty, all of the seafood and chicken were OVER-cooked, the lobster was hallow and had very little meat.  Overall, it's not worth $68.  If my review were based on the paella, it'd have gotten only ONE star.  But I'm giving it  three stars because of its tapas and mojito."}
{"text":"Great Place if you have a lot of time to waste. . . .   

Here's the breakdown. estimate time in increments of 5 mins

about 5 mins to get seated
another 5 to get take our drinks
10 mins to get the drinks and order our food
10 mins for the food to arrive
* 10 mins into eating . . . .  hmm . . . .  where's our server?
10 mins has past, drink cups are empty . . . .  .  hmm. . .  should I get a APB on our server?
15 mins later . . . .   how was everything?  Whoa! his alive!!!
another 5 mins to get the check
. . . . wait my automatic watch stopped working . .  . . . .

All in all the food is mediocre but with molasses type service and contraband prices this place to needs to be banned just like their cigars."}
{"text":"Never been to a place like this before, but I am a fan of Cuban food now!  I had the paradise pork (see pictures) It was a little sweeter than I had expected, but really good.  Beans and rice were spicy, but really tasty.  I also highly recommend the fried bananas!!  I could eat a whole plate of those things ... my only suggestion would be to put chocolate sauce all over them hahaha!!!  

Can't wait to go back and try more.  The service was really good and friendly.   A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I had waited for awhile to try this place, as it's buried in a small little shopping center and couldn't find anyone who wanted to enjoy Cuban food. I first had Cuban food at an awesome little restaurant in DC and it was amazing. This, however, was not that place. 

The summary? I enjoyed it - it was okay, but will not be going back, especially for the bill I paid. 

The atmosphere is pretty cute, it's in a little house-like restaurant in a small shopping center tucked away on Camelback. But it's pretty quiet inside, so I'm not sure I would really like that for a date. Also, the bathroom is outside, which is a little strange. 

I had a glass of Malbec that wasn't all that great, but I'm willing to forgive wine. The other two had cocktails which they really enjoyed - so I think I just ordered poorly.

Then we ordered 5 appetizers and two entrees to split between three people as we wanted to try all that we could. We had the plantains (they were good, but not the best I've had), then plantain chips with bean dip which was amazing! That was the best part of the meal. We ordered three more appetizers that I didn't really eat, so I can't judge them. 

I ordered the chicken with the mango sauce that came with beans and rice. For the price of the meal I was very underwhelmed. It was a really sizeable piece of chicken, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce and the beans and rice were just so-so. 

The service though was awesome though. The waiter was great and answered all of our questions and recommended great appetizers. 4 stars for the service for sure.

Again, I don't think I would go back often, but I'm glad I at least tried it out. I'm also really happy that if I want legitimate Cuban food, I'm coming back here."}
{"text":"Decided to try this venue rather than driving down to their other restaurant on Camelback. We figured we'd have a better chance of being seated here because the other venue is quite small. There is also ample parking. At around 7PM the place started filling up.
We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of space this restaurant had. It was decorated as if we were in Cuba. The server was polite but hardly made conversation, just asked us how the food was and was there anything that she could get us.
We started with Sangria and the Testones, which is grounded green plantains which I thought was a bit dry even with the garlic sauce. We didn't know that it could either be served with a Black Bean dip. As for the Sangria, for me it was potent. Just remember that instead of it mixed with red and white wine you can substitute the white wine with champagne. We weren't even told about those options.
I tried the Sailor's Paella and it had all sorts of seafood: crab, mussels, clams, fish, calamari, scallops, white asparagus and rice. It was served in the pot that it was cooked in, so be careful 'cause you can't dig into until the temperature lowers. The meal wasn't overly salty and was very tasty. If you order this item, don't eat lunch before you come.
My wife ordered the Chicken Chicarrones which was good but a little dry. She took half of them home and had them for lunch.
To top off the meal, I ordered the Flan which was excellent except for the cinnamon cookie on top of the flan. It was different and I left the restaurant satisfied."}
{"text":"YUM!!!! That's what I think whenever I think of this place. I get the same thing each time because its just that delicious. Pollo Cubano. It's delicious chicken cooked in a sauce to die for (cumin, lime, orange, and garlic), and its served with maduros (friend sweet plantains), black beans, and rice. I ate every last bite, and couldn't get over how good it was!! I've only been here for lunch, but the service was great and prices were very reasonable. Especially since my opinion of Scottsdale is that a lot of places tend to be pretty overpriced. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars, is that I haven't really tried anything else but the pollo cubano, and I can't remember what my family got."}
{"text":"I love cuban food!  And so I take every chance to eat it, so when I saw a cuban very close to our hotel in Scottsdale, I was there!  Unfortunately, the minute I walked in, I should have turned around and walked right back out again.  There was a distinct smell that wasn't clean and wasn't pleasant.  But my interest in  a good cuban meal got the better of me.  Big mistake.

The food was definitely sub-par.  I had the sampler, which included pollo cubano, ropa vieja, and masas de puerco.  Unfortunately, none of the dishes was particularly flavorful, and none were good renditions of the dish.  The pollo was bland other than an overly acidic sauce, the ropa vieja was just lacking in flavor and the vegetables and broth hadn't been blended together, and the masas weren't crispy in the least.  The whole meal was a huge let down."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been meaning to visit this place for a year now and finally made it over to Havana Cafe this week. The restaurant is small and quaint, nothing fancy but we enjoyed it. Since it was our first visit, we had a few questions on the menu, but our server wasn't really able to answer any of our questions. He did recommend the calypso chips and black bean dip, which we enjoyed. The Ropa Vieja that I ordered was good and the Paradise Pulled Pork that my boyfriend ordered was a little bland but also good. However, although we enjoyed it, I wouldn't really say these dishes are worth $15-$20 per plate, either in flavor or portion size. I wouldn't say we were disappointed in the visit, we did enjoy our food, but I'm giving it 3 starts for being average in flavor and overpriced (in our opinion.)"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Havana Cafe, it's a great experience.  The service is always quick and efficient and the food is always excellent.  A few of the dishes that I love are the Ropa Vieja, the Picadillo, the Pollo Ajillo, and their sandwiches.  Their tapas are always worth trying too.  Dessert?  To die for.  I'd definitely recommend Havana Cafe to my friends."}
{"text":"Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 4:

07/16/11

Arrived before a friend did, was seated at a two-top, and I was handed a dinner menu.  Had to ask for the Yelp Eats menu (oddity #1 as all the other restaurants I've visited since the start of it all had hosts/servers deliver them w/ the YE menu on the very top of the pile), and when the host handed it over, I noticed a sticker that asked not to share dishes- oddity #2.  As I waited for Linda to arrive, I ordered a mojito ($7.50) and asked server Ana about certain dishes, and she demonstrated great knowledge of both food and beverage menus (kudos to Ana!).  The wonderful mojito (dark rum, fresh lime, muddled mint, sugar, and a \"splash of soda\") arrived just as L. arrived, and, having had their mojitos in the past, she also ordered one for herself.  (If you do not come to dine here, you should at least try their mojito... probably the best I've ever tried, besides the ones I've made!  Not very sweet, the rum not overpower, but still a potent cocktail.)  

After a little chat, we placed our order (split checks) for the Bistec Encevollado (steak w/ onions, for me) and the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters w/ avocado dip, for her).  Despite my preface of \"I'm going to skip on the apps and order an entree, because I want to have dessert later,\" Ana asked me AT LEAST two times \"And what would you like for an appetizer?\"  She even pointed to the app portion of the menu the second time, and again I said I was only going to order the entree as I'd wanted to leave room for dessert.  L. was going to start w/ an app first and see if she was going to order more later.  Again, Ana asked what she'd like for an entree, and when Ana left, we already felt like we were being treated rudely and pressured to order more.  (L. eventually ordered another app, and then a dessert.)  App and steak arrived together, and for the record, I offered L. a taste of the wonderful steak, and she turned it down, bec. she tries not to eat too much red meat, but she did try the Papas de la Casa (spicy homestyle potatoes) and found them very salty.  I described the side dish as \"highly-seasoned.\"  Yes, they were very salty, and I hadn't noticed they were spicy, but Mom did when she tried a little bit at home.  L. tried to share her fritters w/ me, but I've already tried them before, and I wanted to concentrate on the steak.  It was a \"good\" thing that Ana had pressured L. to order a second dish, bec. she actually ended up liking the Frituras de Camarones (three crispy shrimp pancakes served w/ a Romesco sauce).  (Hey!  I was correct when I thought the sauce looked like it was thickened w/ some sort of nuts... friend described it having a flavor she couldn't put a finger on, aside from the pepperiness and acidity... it also contained almonds and sherry.)  I very much enjoyed the Bistec encevollado and would not hesitate to order it again!

Ana had asked a couple of times if I was ready to order dessert, but I decided to wait for L. to finish eating.  I was still enjoying my mojito and was even contemplating on having another.  (Actually, I was stalling for time since I couldn't decide whether I was going to order the chocolate bread pudding w/ homemade dark fudge rum sauce, or the lime pie!)  Finally, I decided to order, and I chose the bread pudding and asked L. if she'd get the lime pie, and she said yes.  Score!  While I enjoyed both desserts (I'd had two \"tastes\" of the pie before I asked for one \"to-go\"), I favored the pie.  That night, however, I couldn't get enough of the fudge rum sauce!!  I tell ya, I don't know what I WOULDN'T do to have another chance at savoring this fudge sauce again.  ;)  As far as the lime pie is concerned, I don't know how Linda could sit there and watch me take three swipes off of her pie... I think I was only able to restrain myself from having more, bec. I knew I'd have another one to enjoy at home!  Oh yeah, take the bread pudding (but leave the rum sauce!), and I'll have the lime pie every time from now on!

We plan on visiting again, esp. on Mojito Mondays ($3 mojitos all day), and we hope that the rudeness was only due to Yelp Eats Week (although there really isn't an excuse for the rudeness!), bec. it would be a shame to have to skip this HC location-- L. said that this location is less noisy than that on Camelback.  I probably should not have tipped 20% off of the original cost of the my bill (original would've been $40.50, plus tax, and w/ the YE discount, a total of $27, w/ tax), since she was so rude to us, but I didn't want her to think that Yelpers were cheapskates.  

p.s.  Almost forgot to mention, upon entry to this location, I couldn't help but noticing that the restaurant smelled strongly of body odor!  (Onions.)  If I wasn't meeting a friend here, I might've walked out and gone somewhere else.  

p.p.s.  The Cuban bread was terrific!"}
{"text":"Looking at the handy dandy Yelp Rating Distribution bar graph, it can be assessed that Havana Café is all over the road when it comes to... well... everything I guess, based on the reviews I've read. Luckily for me, I came on a good night.

It was a Tuesday evening around 5:30-5:45 and there were no customers, so it was peaceful. A little while after us, a party of 5 adults and a child arrived. No one else showed up during the little over an hour we were there. Two couples however, did arrive just as we were leaving. 

So... good for us because it was a nice, semi-quiet evening and we could take in the whole restaurant, But I would have to say it was a bad night if you're the restaurant owner. 

I guess that's why they're dropping Groupons for Havana Café like they're hot. We had a Groupon. I admittedly just now bought Another Groupon for HC when we got home because we thought the place was great.

We started with an order of tostones and a cup of the seasonal Pumpkin Bisque. The tostones weren't the best I've had. Not quite as crispy as I like. The inside seemed a little under cooked. Not bad though, just okay. The mojo, garlic, lime juice-sauce that comes with them on the other hand, was very good. 

The Pumpkin Bisque was excellent. They make it in-house with pumpkins they buy at the local markets. They only have it for a limited time, so if you want to try it, I would recommend doing it soon.

For my entrée, I went with the Bistec Encevollado. It's a marinated steak with onions and I had it with rice and black beans. I thought it was very good and it was a big portion. I packed  1/2 of it to-go so I could delve into their desserts.

I saw the Pumpkin Flan when we first looked over the menu, and there was no way I was leaving without trying it. We also had a mini coconut flan and a mini chocolate pudding. 

The Pumpkin Flan was like eating the filling of a pumpkin pie without having to deal with the crust. That was perfect for me since I don't favor pie crust. It was topped with either a brown sugar or apple butter sauce, I'm not sure. The sauce was labelled as a brown sugar sauce in the menu, but it wasn't super sweet. Not a bad thing, the dessert as a whole was good. 

The coconut flan was another winner. It had a nice, clean, fresh flavor and shredded coconut on top. I think it also had a light lemon sauce on it. Very good.

The chocolate bread pudding wasn't bad. It had a chocolate rum sauce and on it and there was no mistaking that there was rum in it. A good dessert if you're craving chocolate and don't mind rum. 

This was my first Cuban food experience in Phoenix and I'm very pleased. I don't have any solid complaints. I can see how parking could be an issue, but I can walk here from my place so that isn't an issue for me. 

I will definitely be back. Actually, according to my new Groupon I'll be back by November 25th."}
{"text":"The Mojitos are top, top notch, the customer service is beyond friendly, and the food is delicious. Love it."}
{"text":"Sadly, the original location is closing, leaving the NE Phoenix restaurant the only one left."}
{"text":"Cute interior, decent food, but how can I actually receive the food if the waiter never comes to take my order?  We were seated and served water, and proceeded to wait.... and wait.... and wait.... while we saw both waiters serve other tables but never go to ours to actually take our order despite staring at them and attempting to flag them down.  After 10 minutes we managed to flag down the busboy who served us our water, to ask him to tell our waiter that we were ready to order.  Another 10 minutes goes by, and we see no sign of any waiter, just the busboy.  We consider leaving, but ask the busboy again if the waiter is coming to take our order.  Despite the busboy telling him that we needed someone to come by, the waiter apparently did not feel that we needed to be served anything since he still hadn't come by to even tell us his name.  We ended up taking our orders through the busboy, and he ended up doing most of the waiter's job for him.  

The food itself?  A bit expensive, but tasty, depending on what you get.  Some of the dishes that had chicharones (pork cracklings) had slices of pork skin in the meal rather than mashed up bits.  I wasn't a big fan of this, since the chicharones, when rehydrated, taste really rubbery and bland when left as a small strip instead of being mashed up with the rest of the ingredients.  As for the rest of the food we tried, the pollo parilla was very good.  It was tender, with a nice tropical tasting marinade that matched with the chicken very well.  I wanted to try a bunch of items, so we also had the San Juan sampler, which consists of several of the appetizers in one plate.  The best item in the sampler was the Puerto Rican style tamal.  It had a very moist masa filling and was flavorful.

In the end, I personally gave our tip to the busboy, since he pretty much did most of the actual waiter's job at our table, since I only saw the real waiter for probably a total of 30 seconds."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty Cuban food.

The ropa vieja was flavorful, but a little tough.
The chicken and pork were very good,
Marinated in tropical and spicy flavors
The cho-cho (chayote in Spanish) was excellent
The sauce tasted a lot like Hollandaise sauce though? (Strange)

Service was very attentive.
I would gladly eat here again!"}
{"text":"Black bean fritters rock and they have a couple good vegetarian options. They are always accommodating and make a good mojito. 

Oh and when they have the pumpkin bisque ... oh lord!"}
{"text":"This is a really relaxed place to go. The waiter was wearing a Hawaiin shirt and was very friendly. 

I love that the menu has so many options and the pricing is really reasonable. I'm not sure how authentic everything is but everything tasted good. 

Overall a good comfort place !"}
{"text":"I miss this place every day.

Used to live right behind it, and took it for granted.  Simple and the yummiest.

Their Berenjena con Garbonzo is one of the most magical things I have ever put in my mouth.

Black bean fritters, ham croquettes-- everything is good.

OH!  Their cocktails!!"}
{"text":"The black bean fritters are fantastic and the Papa Rellena was absolutely to die for. The Sangria is $28 for a pitcher and that is about 8 glasses so a good deal and it was delicious. Service is a bit slow, but an enjoyable place none the less."}
{"text":"I am hesitant to write this review seeing all the glorious write ups before me. I came for lunch today and was very disappointed. I ordered the tapas trio and 30 minutes later the server came over to tell me they were out of the sauce for the meatballs and the chef did not want to make a substitution. Not a big deal, but 30 minutes was quite a while to wait to be told to order something else. 

On the servers suggestion I ordered the pollo cubano, it came out very, very dry. It was covered in a citrus sauce that was decent, but even with the sauce and marinated onions on top the chicken was barely edible. 
My friend ordered Arroz con Pollo and the chicken was just as dry, I didn't taste any chorizo and the asparagus was overcooked to a mush.
The sangria was pretty good and had a subtle rose taste.. I'd return just for it.

Like I said with so many good reviews perhaps this was just an off day. I'll certainly go back and give them another try, hopefully with an updated review to follow."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the years but forgot to write a review before now. The service and food are always excellent. My favorite dish is the pork with beans and rice and a wonderful au jus. Fresh lime slices that just go perfectly with it. Fresh iced tea with mango. I always get a side order of the plantains too. They give you wonderful island bread for no extra charge.  I used to live in the Caribbean and know their food is authentic and very well done. Generous portions.
My only complaint is that they have gotten me completely hooked on mojitos!! I had my first one there and now I just can't stop craving them. 
Nice toe-tapping Cuban music. Not snooty fancy but very nice casual. You feel like you're on a patio instead of in an enclosed room."}
{"text":"Food was not worth the attitude. It made dinner very uncomfortable. The cuisine is unique, but poorly prepared. Again, service was horrible. The original Havana Cafe... off Camelback, is superior. Stay clear of THIS location."}
{"text":"The distinguished puertorican writer and  political advocate Lola Rodriguez de Tio in her 1893 publication of the poem: \"A Cuba\" said: \"Cuba y Puerto Rico son de un pajaro las dos alas\". (Cuba and Puerto Rico are the two wings of a bird). And for those of us living far away from our beloved Islands, The Havana Cafe offers the perfect mixture of culture, food, flavors, music and atmosphere.  Especially when one doesn't feel like getting in the kitchen or catching the next flight to San Juan.  Pricey?  Yes, like any other premium service of its kind.  Delicious and as authentic as one can find 2000 miles away from home.  Don't forget to try the \"Arroz con Gandules\"; it is phenomenal! Sorry mom!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the third time recently on a Monday night with a Groupon. Had a few mojitos and some empanadas. The food was decidedly bland and the service was eh. Had a Groupon and therefore we were charged full price for the mojitos instead of the Mojito Madness Monday price.

I really hate it when places put out these discount offers and then put so many restrictions on them. I don't consider that good customer service at all. I have no interest in going back here."}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times now, most recently last week. Definitely one of those unique spots that gives you a flavor of something off the beaten path.

The decor is very unique and the entire restaurant has a great atmosphere, you really do feel like you're in another culture and it definitely is anything but chain-restaurant fair, so I definitely give them props for that. Nothing better than escaping the jungle of cookie-cutter places and finding something real, right? 

As far as the food goes, my favorite dishes have got to be the Pollo Ajillo and, secondly, the Pollo Cubano. Both are excellent and have always been perfectly flavored, but the Ajillo is far more satisfying for some reason. I just love the combination of the rice and seasoned chicken, it is out of this world good!

My only gripe about this place has got to be the service. On both recent visits, we've experienced insanely long wait times for drinks, much less getting our orders in. I appreciate the staffing constraints, but I really had to see the place lose customers on account of a bad experience. The last time we were in there, we saw a woman wandering around calling out for someone to take her check and run the card so she could leave. I kind of doubt those folks are coming back. 

Me? I'm a fan regardless, but it still nags me. If I ever run into bad food and bad service in the same visit though, that will probably do it for me. Until then, I'll keep coming back for some of the best Cuban food that money can buy. I would encourage anyone to give it a try, but don't be in a hurry!"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon and went for dinner with my boyfriend last night.  This place is amazing!  We started off with the tapas sampler, and everything on it was great.  We also ordered bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, which just melted in my mouth.  For our entree, we shared a fried chicken dish--very good and actually not too heavy.  And if course, since it's a Cuban restaurant, I had mojitos.  They were delicious, and very authentic--no Bacardi!  In addition to the great food, the service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here this evening and the food was delicious! I've read some of the previous posts and they sure don't sound like what we experienced tonite. I called to make a reservation due to some of the comments in reviews but was told that it's not necessary. Only reason they were having people make reservations was during spring training and it was extremely busy. We got there around 5:30 and were seated immediately. The waitress was great, she came to the table for our drink order and asked if we had any questions about the menu. The waitress also gave us a basket with a loaf of warm cuban bread and butter. OMG!!! It was freshly baked and delicious. I could've eaten the whole loaf myseIf. I oredered the black bean soup which was fantastic!!! Definitely one of the best I've ever had. My main entree was the Ropas Viejo. It was piping hot and a very generous portion. I ended up taking 1/2 of it home. So, I guess I can't find anything wrong with this place. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Okay, This would have five stars but for one thing:  We were with a group of people and two of us had groupons.  Now I know the groupon reads ONE PER TABLE....I also knew we were going to spend considerably MORE than both groupons so I asked ahead of time if we could sit together.  The person working the front said she'd go check.  The owner came out and was really very rude and said, \"No, you must be seated separately and you cannot combine anything.  Totally separate!\" and she was frowning.  Now, this was the first impression of several people in our party and that didn't sit well.

However, I fully intended to tell them we'd spend WELL over the limits but I told her that we were fine with being separated and all sat down.  The wait staff was very nice and our waiter especially was just a joy.  The food took quite a while but was well worth it.  It was kind of a bummer to not be all together but once the food arrived everyone was silent anyway!

We started with Calypso Chips and black bean dip which are divine.  I had the Pollo Cubano which was okay.  The highlight of the plate for me was the black beans and rice.  Those were terrific!

My mother in law had the ham croquettes which were so-so and the Papas Rellena which are heaven!  My daughter had Sopa de Pollo which was also just so-so.  

The deserts were to DIE FOR!  My daughter had Marquesa de Chocolate.  Basically  chocolate ganauche with Grand Manier flavoring with the most amazing whipped cream over it.  Totally rich!  Mother in Law had the bread pudding which had her almost in tears she enjoyed it so much.  If I were to go again, I'd just get a big plate of beans and rice and a Papa Rellena and dessert.  

I will go again for the food even if the owner was rude. It's that good!  Again, we spent at least 1.5 times the amount of the groupon, each. We'll be back again, but really if you decide to have a groupon to get people in, try to be mellow and accomodate them too!  Or at least make sure your food is so good they want to deal with attitude!"}
{"text":"Havana Cafe caters for Passover and provides the greatest Kosher for Passover food I've ever had.  Now that I've outed myself as a Jew, let me just say that Kosher for Passover is one step above regular Kosher rules requiring no bread products, which usually means that the food is even blander than usual.  This may not seem possible after you've had a Kosher meal, but it turns out that the food tends to get even blander the more ingredients that are not allowed.  Somehow Havana is able to overcome the bland requirement to create the best kosher for Passover food I've ever had.  The brisket is good for several meals, and the dish with the eggplant and matzah is amazingly good even though there is no meat and it is not better than the brisket.  Besides, it's nice to have some more leftovers after I am done eating the leftover brisket.

But. . . how come the food at the restaurant isn't as good?  That just seems to be one of the mysteries of life that I have been unable to fathom after five visits.  The Kosher for Passover food is actually much better than anything I have ever ordered at the restaurant.  My wife really likes the place even though the location near us closed, so I'll continue to contemplate this mystery and look forward to Passover and leftovers."}
{"text":"I came here with Jim and Audrey W for the first time tonight and it was pretty good.  I've seen a few reviews for this place, so I was glad to try it out.

I admit, I don't have a lot of exposure to cuban food.  I found this place to be quite authentic in my book...not your usual corporate stuff, thats for sure.  Very intimate with staff that really seems to know what thier doing.

I wasnt all that hungry and wanted to get something light, so I stuck with an appitizer.  I cant remember the name of what I ordered becuase it was in spanish and I could not pronounce it, but it was good.  Jims dish looked really good, and Audrey had some fish.  Every one was happy.

Beverages were always topped off and I enjoyed my experience here.  I found it to be on the pricy side, so it was good that I didnt have much of an appetite.  I wasnt looking to spend a lot of money and really didnt want a forklift full of food, which is what they seem to serve here.  On the lighter side, they seem to have an amazing menu with LOTS to choose from!
Very impressive.

A good time was had by all, and if you like Cuban food, go here!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to the food here and a little disappointed. I do have to say that we tried the gingered sweet potato and pumpkin soup and loved it! The tostones were deep deep fried and overdone. If they hadn't been overdone they would have been great - the mojo (i think it was a mojo that came with them) was pretty good.  We also each tried a little glass of sherry - the manzanilla on the menu - I've never had sherry before and can't really make an educated comment about it because I have no reference for what sherry is supposed to taste like - it reminded me a little bit of Sake - but I can be way off. It was interesting. 

For food one of us had the Pollo Cubano which was ok and the other had the catch of the day - I was a little disappointed in the catch of the day as I thought the focus of the dish would be the fresh fish but it ended up tasting more like the batter smothered with the creamy cheesy sauce. 

I might go back to try some other items on the menu.Nothing to complain about as far as the service- in fact our waiter was great.  We would have tried the dessert if we weren't so full.

The live music was a great touch. Overall we enjoyed the ambiance but were disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch with my husband the other day. I've never had Cuban food, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The food was good, but it wasn't as spicy as I was expecting. But that is probably just my misunderstanding of Cuban food! I had the sun spots for an app, and they were very good and hit the spot, but my fried chicken was not very exciting. I will probably come back to try something else. My husband loved his beef dish. Service was great and it was a nice little spot for a late lunch."}
{"text":"We loved the live music and outdoor patio. Food was great. Very authentic."}
{"text":"This is the first review I have written that I truly hope the restaurant management reads.  Havana Cafe used to be one of the few restaurants I used to brag about to out-of-town friends.  They had a dozen dishes that I would classify as excellent and many others that were just \"quite good\".  But it has gone drastically downhill.  Here are a few examples:

1.  The appetizer portions are smaller than they used to be, sometimes ridiculously so.  For example, the chicken croquettes ($6) consisted of two pieces the size and shape of a thumb (a child's thumb), filled with pureed chicken and almost entirely tasteless.

2.  The entrees (we had ropa viejo and picadillo) were adequate in size but spiced very poorly.  The picadillo had no tropical spicing, and in fact tasted faintly bitter.  The ropa viejo was vinegary.  This points to incompetence in the cooking staff.

3.  The prices remain high.  But they are cutting corners -- no bread was served with the meal this time, for example.

4.  The menu was never really authentic Cuban, but it did have a number of popular Cuban dishes, with an interesting admixture of Central and South American favorites.  Some are still on the menu, but others have given way to meat loaf and fried chicken.

It looks to me like the management of Havana Cafe is flopping around, looking for a way to make money (or more money) and has made a series of poor decisions.  If you are listening:  it's time to hire a better chef, make the menu more authentic, get rid of those $5 plastic chairs, provide real value, and pay more attention to managing the wait staff.  I hope to see you back to your previous glory, but I'm not holding my breath.  And I am not spending $100 for two people for what you have to offer."}
{"text":"I was hoping for so much more.  Kind of a cute looking restaurant.  Outside patio is quaint and fine.  We had the tostones which weren't as crispy as i like them and the sauce that accompanies the tostones wasn't that great.  They were already all out of the arroz con pollo by 6:30 p.m. (what?!) so I had another chicken dish.  Husband had the pulled pork.  We were not wowed by either dish.  Wasn't horrible but nothing to come back for.
The worst part was how all over the place the wait-staff was.  One person was like the hostess but was coming to our table throughout the night.  Another dude came and took our food order but was so creepy that i nearly lost my appetite.  Yet another person delivered our meals but again returned to the table at some point to clear a dish and then another person cleared other dishes.  We waited forever for our check, forever to pay, etc.  And although it sounds like a lot of people were coming to our table, few people actually visited us after our food arrived to see how everything was.  My husband was SO annoyed.  Definitely not a great place and not worth its money.  it's a shame because if the owners knew how badly run it was, they'd change it--very much out of a kitchen nightmares episode."}
{"text":"The reason I gave 2 stars is mainly due to price. I found Cafe Havana rather pricey. $17 for Ropa Vieja, is expensive in my book. It was good, though, but not $17 good for stewed beef on white rice. They did have a varied menu of South American, Caribbean, and Central American dishes that all looked quite tasty. I tried one of my dining companions red fish with a Veracruz type sauce on top. It was huge, but a bit bland. Overall, it is a unique place, but I'd only go again if someone else paid. I live in Dallas though, so the chances of me going again are slim to none. In Dallas, we have a few similar type restaurants but not with as much varietycas Cafe Havana."}
{"text":"Never been to Cuba, but I really respect its food.  The food is filled with flavors really brining the Cuban culture to through its food.  This is a traditional ma and pa restaurant that can open your eyes to new flavors."}
{"text":"Last night I was going through some of my gift certificates (Groupon) and wanted to find somewhere new to eat half-way between Litchfield Park and Gilbert....we landed at Havana Cafe in Phoenix.   

I missed it at first and had to turn around, it is somewhat hidden and unexpected.  

Service was fantastic!   While we had one main server, there were two others that were constantly available to help us out.    

I ate Cuban food in Miami once several years ago and have a general understanding of it, but wasn't sure what to expect here.    We ordered a few appetizers - the fried Plantain Chips and the sweet Potato Chips.  Both were great - so great in fact that we ordered more and had to share some entrees.    The best thing I tasted there was the Guava-Banana-Ketchup dip for the sweet potato fries.....YUMMY!  I wish I could have the recipe!    We also tried the Pumpkin soup (my second favorite thing I tasted), the Cuban Meatloaf, the Cuban Sandwich, a Pork Tamal, and the Black Beans & Rice.  My son had kids fried shrimp which was also pretty good for a kids meal.  All were very very good!

The prices were higher than I expected, but worth it.

This restaurant is a gem - I LOVED it!    I will absolutely visit again.  There are many items on the menu that I want to try...perhaps I'll visit a few more times, and experiment at the Chandler location which is closer to me."}
{"text":"It would take a lot of mojitos and sangria to get me back to Havana Cafe anytime soon. Is the food bad? No. But Cuban food is a bit bland on my taste buds next to other foreign cuisines The San Juan Platter I had was kind of plain, and only a garlic sauce gave some of the items any taste at all. The pollo cubano was pretty much chicken soaked in lime juice and buried in sauteed onions. 

But those mojitos and sangria are definitely tasty, and the waiting staff is excellent. It seemed, though, a woman I guess was the owner thought a Saturday night would be a great time to conduct a rather loud discussion about marketing and operations for Havana Cafe. That sliced into the already dull atmosphere. 

Another complaint: Why does Havana Cafe feel the need to take up its entire front parking lot with valet parking? I'm neither too lazy to walk, not do I enjoy having strangers drive my vehicle. For a parking lot so small in a climate so mild, valet parking is just stupid. 

Really, if I want a fairly fancy Latin-flavored meal, I'll just head over to Asi es la Vida or Mucho Gusto Taqueria. Both restaurants are a lot more inventive, interesting and memorable."}
{"text":"Got a deal on Groupon & glad I did. Latin is way out numbered here in the Phoenix by Mexican. But this place hits it on the nose and puts Latin on the map.  And they spare no space on the plate.  The Bistec Encebollada was a large plate, took half home. Steak was juicy & well marrinated. Black beans & rice were perfect. Maduro (plantains) were sweet. The Pollo Parilla was also large plate of food & every ounce of goodness. The mango sauce complimented the marinated rotisserie chicken. We had mojitos & the Havana Cooler.... how refreshing!!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here once with a friend. That should be a tip-off of how this review will go.

We tried a ton of their tapas. Most were ok, one or two that were noteworthy, but not worth coming back for.

The sangria was ok, seemed like it was from a bottle. Palatable, but again, not worth coming back for.

The service was fine, we came during lunch and it was deathly quiet so we sat outside.

I want to go back and try their paella, it's supposed to be good, but I'm skeptical that it's any better than the kind at Baby Kay's (which is also not good).

Overall, very ok place to eat if you're in the mood for something new. I can't in good conscience say that it was anything other than a nice first and last experience due to the bland flavors."}
{"text":"Me likey! (remember that episode of Sex and the City?).  Anyways, Havana Cafe is such a cute place.  It's perfect to come on a date or with a few friends.  The place is small, and gives off an intimate vibe.  The restaurant decor is vibrant and colorful, so you'll feel cheery as you devour your tapas.

They have great sangria that I highly recommend, just don't get two pitchers of it like my friend and I did.  It's stronger than it seems my friend, it's stronger than it seems.  

They have a long list of tapas to choose from, and it's fun to get a few different ones to share with your pals.  The prices are very reasonable too, most of the tapas are anywhere from $5-8 and the portions are a good size. 

If you haven't tried tapas before, this is a good place to do it.  The servers are friendly and fast, and they'll help you order if you aren't sure how or where to start."}
{"text":"I came here for the second time last night.  Audrey W and I met Amy B for dinner.

I opted for the special and kind of regret it.  It was a seafood paella.  I have to remind myself sometimes that I don't live by the ocean anymore and very few restaurants here in the valley provide good quality seafood dishes along the lines of the paella.

It was mediocre and I know many other things I have had at Havana Cafe are much better.

:-( 

I'll just have to bank on my upcoming dinner at Wildfish for Restaurant Week to set me right.  I'm having the cioppino.

I used to order things like cioppino or \"Fruite de Mare\" all the time when I lived in Boston and I always enjoyed it.  Two times ordering that sort of thing at restaurants in Phoenix and :-(  

Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Only had a short amount of time for lunch. 

Potage del Caribe. Creamy Caribbean chowder combining conch, shrimp, white fish, potatoes, fresh tomatoes and tidbits of salt pork. $7.95. This bowl is loaded with meat 'n potatoes. On the side Italian baguette bread 'n butter.

This was an excellent meal. I will be back."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!food is awful, place smells.  Would not recommend this place at all.
Food is made with this lime juice and all food is covered with onions, and the black beans and rice is GROSS."}
{"text":"Three of us went after work and before a show. We sat at the bar and got to know Steve, through conversation. I ordered the Paradise Pulled Pork followed by the rice pudding. Atmosphere makes you feel like you're not in Scottsdale anymore, and the food was great, with just enough heat for me. It's a little pricey, but good food, for sure."}
{"text":"I go here all the time and I love it!  Such great ambiance for such a little place, always cozy and fun to stop in here for a bite.  The tapas are all perfectly spicy or fruity or whatever they want them to be - I usually order a variety every time I go.  The ceviche is great on hot days.  Also a big fan of the repollo relleno.  The desserts are awesome as well, especially the guava empanadas (just let them cool down before you bit into them!).  I don't usually order the meals, but when I have, they have been very good.  I am definitely more a fan of just ordering a bunch of tapas.  Also, great mojitos and sangria!  Very cute and pleasant place.  Great service, very friendly people."}
{"text":"Havana Cafe refused my business today when I walked into their establishment wearing a trendy bluish, turquoise singlet. Apparently, this wannabe 4-star \"cafe\", that resides in a plaza for God's sakes has a clothing rule that says men have to wear sleeves, but women do not. I challenged, Keith, the waiter/proprietor, that my date was also wearing a similar sleeveless top and he proceeded to tell me that men are not allowed to wear sleeveless tops, and that if I were to eat there I would have to wear one of his awful red Hawaiian print polos with bamboo images on it that was two sizes too big! WTF?! So you'd rather offend me and require me to wear some crap Hawaiian shirt that I'm swimming in?! Mind you, it's 113 degrees out! In what world is this more \"appropriate attire\" than my tank and not outright sexual discrimination? For those of you who think this is a joke, it ACTUALLY HAPPENED!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day and I was surprised i hadn't heard of this place sooner. It was great. The bread was delicious, service and ambiance were superb and the pork sandwich I had was amazing. Everything was seasoned just right and I left feeling very full. It is too bad I had to go to work after because there specialty drinks and import drafts looked great. I will go back for dinner very soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a Groupon or we likely wouldn't have tried this restaurant. I've driven past it for years and always wanted to eat there, but it's ridiculously overpriced. Even with the Groupon ($25) our bill was an additional $70!

My husband had the Emparedado Cubano, which is a Cuban sandwich which was $16 and was quite tasty, although he picked off the pickles. I just thought it tasted like a pickly ham sandwich. I had the Gallina Frita, which was excellent, but a huge amount of food for one person. The shredded chicken was succulent and rich, with caramelized onions and other flavors and the side dishes were good but not extraordinary. At least I had leftovers for lunch the next day.

My husband really enjoyed his two mojitos and he's quite picky about his mojito quality. My caipirinha was just okay, as it was overly limey. We had the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer and they were excellent. 

The waiter took a very long time to greet us after we were seated and he continued to be absent for very long intervals, although he was very nice and helpful in helping me pick out a main dish to order. Overall, our meal including appetizer and dessert took slightly more than 2 hours, although the restaurant was not at all busy (when we got there, there were maybe 3 other tables seated).

I agree with others that think the decor is pretty sad. The plastic chairs seem out of place in a restaurant that asks you to pay upwards of $16 per entree.

Probably won't ever go back, unless it's for happy hour, since this place is just so expensive, but the food was quite good."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere and good service. The only really bad thing I can say, is that they are way over priced for what you get. Nice little spot to have a nice meal with your lady if you have some extra money to burn."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before.  Wifey and I really enjoyed it.  I'm sorry a previosu reviewer did not enjoy the cold bean dip with hot chips - I thought that was a very interesting dish with the temperature being used to accent it.

It's been too long since we ate there for me to recall the specifics.  I do remember that the mojito was very good - perhaps the best I have had in Phoenix.

Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  The decor is a little odd as I recall, striving for Havana I guess.  But comfortable enough and made up for by the food.  Not cheap, by any means, but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We have tried Havana Cafe several times as we love Cuban food (used to live in Miami). Tonight, once again we had just OK food and way over paid. 

My Daughter has to eat \"gluten free\" and we found out today they do NOT have a dedicated fryer.  At the table next to us the kids were eating chicken nuggets.  My Celiac peers please double check before eating here.

The Masas de Puerco was dry and I ended up with the burned part of the beans from the bottom of the pan.  The food is barely average and super expensive.  We had 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes for four of us (2 kids) with one soda and it was over $60.  Kids dishes are $9.95."}
{"text":"Another awesome dinner at Havana Cafe! The service was a slow because they were short a waiter, but everything else was just about perfect. We split the onion/almond soup, which was unbelievably delicious, and my mojito was back to its usual perfection. Both the Masas de Puerco Fritas (crisp pork morsels with mojo-garlic lime sauce, rice and beans) and the seafood special were outstanding. Cheesecake with chocolate rum fudge sauce closed out the evening, and we both agreed it was among the best cheesecakes we've ever had (and the slice was HUGE).

What are you waiting for? Go now!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice - once before Groupon hit and once with a Groupon. Both times the food was excellent-  we'd been to lunch. I am a sucker for their bean fritters and the lemony garlicky dip it comes with. Very good vegetarian entree - cho cho flavored with carribean curry. The husband devoured his tres leche and my flan. He seemed to enjoy his house sangria as well. 

Wish we lived closer - it's not an easy hike for some lazy people in chandler."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  But the service we had A LOT to be desired.  I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.

I came here recently with a friend hoping for flavorful Cuban food but we both found the food  to be mediocre as far as Cuban cuisine goes. I feel bad for leaving such a short review, but there just isn't much else to say. I can't complain about the service, wait time or the atmosphere, the food was just rather bland and very disappointing. 

I am a vegetarian and my friend a carnivore and we were both disappointed with the our meals. The food didn't taste horrible, it was just lacking in flavor (think Luby's) and we left with no reason to come back in the future. 

I have since heard that the Havana Cafe location down on E. Camelback is much better so will look forward to giving that location a try next time I am in the area. Hopefully I will have great things to report."}
{"text":"I've always been curious about Havana Cafe and a Groupon that I purchased a little while back finally got me in there. Overall, it was a good experience... some hits and some misses. 

We arrived right as the live music was starting which was so nice and gave us an \"on vacation\" vibe. We shared a 1/2 pitcher of sangria which was pretty tasty. Their tapas portions are pretty generous and we completely over-ordered. Here's what we got: 

Calypso Chips: plantain chips with black bean dip. I love plantain chips and the black bean dip was very flavorful. I nearly attacked the waiter when my boyfriend told him it was okay to take the left over plantain chips from our table.... Never take plantain chips from a hungry girl!

Tamal Cubano: A tamale with bits of pork in it. I thought it was good, my boyfriend really liked it. I think I'm spoiled with the homemade tamales my family gets at Christmastime. 

Frituras de Camarones: These are exactly like crab cakes, but made out of shrimp. I ordered them because it came with romesco sauce (an amazing sauce made from almonds and roasted red peppers). I slathered the romesco sauce ontop of the cake and squeezed some lime on top. I loved it, but I guess it could have been almost anything doused  in romesco and I would have liked it. 

Empanaditas with shredded beef: Good, but was hoping for a little more flavor. 

Yuca Frita: I was too full to really eat much of this, but I wanted to try their spicy banana-guava ketchup that came with them. We looked up Yuca (or cassava) and it's defined as a \"woody shrub\". That's kind of what the yuca fries tasted like: kind of dry and woody. The spicy banana-guava ketchup was good though - I'd just guess the sweet potato fries are a better bet. 

Service was a little slow (our waiter had a huge rowdy table he was helping). Overall, I'd say it's a fun place to try. A good place to go when you need a little variety."}
{"text":"Okay...so it was my first time having tapas, and it really makes me want more.

One star for service
One star for atmosphere
Two stars for delicious mouthwatering tapas.  My favorites were the cuban tamales, and fried plantains.  The others were good as well, but those particularly stood out in my mind.  The tamales were a delectable mix of sweet and salty but not too much of either as to make you sick.  It actually made you want more.

One star lost out because of price.  It's quite hefty on the bankbook... but for a once-in-a-while treat, it's highly worth it.  It's really good for a date if you want to impress him or her, and a day with the girls always warrants a neat little place like this.

I know there are other locations in town, but for some reason I've heard the one in Scottsdale is the best.  All I know is, I'll drive another 45 miles just to get those tamales again!"}
{"text":"This location is so much bigger than the Camelback location I think I will be changing to this one from now on.  

As always the food is great I went with a couple friends and we ordered the tapas menu and had like 11 things highlights were:
bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates
calypso chips
tortilla espanola
ceviche
and the mojito mmmmmmm

The service was great.

If you've never been it's a great spot to try out"}
{"text":"Last night I went back to Havana Cafe with a groupon and wasn't as excited when I left.  For starters we get there and go to ask for a table and get wait time and the head of the house says it's like 20-30 min wait you sure you want to wait and we said yes that's fine and he goes ok and walks off shaking his head.  We were a little caught by surprise as that's not very professional but whatever he wasn't the cook.  So we sit down and wait and notice he is trying to get people to not wait and leave every single party that came up asking for a table as a matter of fact.  Many of us waiting have started to laugh at how horrible this guy is.  He even went as far as saying ya it's over a 30 min. wait so I wouldn't wait if I were you.  OMG really??? I hope the owner reads this and does something because if that was my restaurant I would be pissed.  

Anyways on to the meal.  Laura A. and I shared the Tapas sampler which was good it comes with a Tamal Cubano which was excellent, some Chorizo and vegetables, Frituras de Frijoles, Maduros Fritos, Bacalaitos Fritos, and a couple Croquetas.  It was perfect for the two of us to share but there was a lot of fried on the plate which wasn't as much variety as we would hope for.  

We both finished the meal with coffee she got the Café Cubano which was a sweet espresso and I went with the Moro Castle which had Dark rum, Bailey's and butterscotch schnapps combined with Cuban coffee it was a nice way to end the evening and enjoy with dessert which we shared a coconut flan with mango sauce.  The dessert was good not great though I am a huge flan fan and I have had better.  

So overall I would say the meal was a 3.5 but the front of the house being so rude knocked it all the way down to a 2.  Pretty sad after I had given it a 4.5 on my last trip."}
{"text":"Whoops...left this in drafts for almost 2 weeks.  Ok, so now it's been 2 weeks since my first meal at Havana Cafe.  Haven't had Cuban food since last Miami visit in '05.  The black bean fritters were delish!!!  I had the Ensalada Savilla...YUM.  I did steal some of my dad's beans and rice, which were good.  My daughter had tamales, which she loved, but they were chicken so I didn't try those.  My sangria was quite nice too.  Probably not my favorite restaurant, but it was a nice change of pace and tasty!"}
{"text":"I know fellow Yelper Sarah L. will try to outdo me on this review, but I say bring it on.

We arrived to the restaurant @  6:30 which was our reservation time. We had a large group (12) and the table had already been pre-set. I enjoyed that more than seeing servers scurrying around getting tables together, or worse yet, not having the foresight to ensure that there were enough tables for our group. One thing that I did not enjoy about our arrival was the aroma of slightly fermented fish. Although I despise any fish or shellfish in Arizona (save sushi) I thought this place might have higher standards on freshness. Maybe I was smelling their garbage. In any case, my nose did not  get a good first impression.

We sat down and ordered beverages. I started with a mojito and water. The mojito arrived quickly but the water did not. After 5 minutes, I asked our server if I could have water. He did not seem upset or irritable about my request. He got it quickly and for the rest of the evening, my water was constantly refilled. 

The service was unremarkable. Which is good. If I remember something about the service, it is because they hover, or forget or get too personal. The staff was friendly, helpful and quite professional. 

We had thought about getting tapas but people started ordering tapas as entrees and I wanted to enjoy my entree fully. On the next visit I will grab some. For my meal, I ordered the paradise pulled pork which is Tender, lean pulled pork sautéed with onions, sweet peppers, garlic and
herbs, laced with habanero chiles. Served with black beans and rice. The server remarked good choice. I asked him if he was lying. He said no and I believed him. 

As people started receiving their entrees, I could tell that they liked them. I did not observe one person from our group add any salt or pepper to their dish. That says a lot about the preparation of the dish. Most of us are picky eaters. As for mine, it was very savory, with an excellent initial taste that leaves a garnish of habanero heat on the palette. I would compare the taste of it to many beautiful entree aromas I have smelled in the past, only to be disappointed by the actual taste. At Havana, they were not lacking in the taste department. Just to clarify, it hit my olfactory area and matched up with my tongue readily. The beans were divine, the rice was standard and unremarkable (use previous definition). 

The night starts to wear down. One of the lights outside on the patio is a bit bright. I order coffee. The mug has an antiquity look about it. Not what I expected at a restaurant. The coffee was memorable. It had a good initial taste, not too hot, but felt like water as it washed down my throat. I am less apt to order it again.

Dessert came. My mother order the Marquesa de Chocolate a rich and creamy double chocolate paté laced with Grand Marnier and served with whipped cream and toasted walnut (their words). My friend Nicole tasted it and said it was moussy fudge. Although I did not have any, they were quite keen on it. 

Fellow yelper Sarah L. glared at me all evening. And with good reason. My review will be better than hers. 

Overall, the negs were fishy smell and remarkable coffee. Pozs are great food, unremarkable service and decent ambiance."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! Went there last night and had a great experience. We showed up at 9pm and there was plenty of seating inside and outside on the adorable patio with lights strung up and music playing. Our server was fantastic, and he recommended the black bean fritter appetizer which was to DIE for. I would go back again just for those, with the avocado dip, they were amazing. We also had the gazpacho soup, which was good, nothing amazing but there's not a whole lot you can do with gazpacho. Also had a chicken entree that had fried plantains and beans and rice that was quite good but too big to finish. Great wine and Brazilian beer too. All in all, a great experience and we will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Firstly, this is Arizona turn the air conditiioning on! Normally I am not big on atmosphere, but when its 80 degrees plus outside, I expect a comfortable temperature. I had to sit outside since the inside was stuffy, and the black curtains did not do my comfort level any justice. 

Now that I am done ranting a bit, lets get on to the food. At this point, unfortunately, it does not get any better. We ordered the Pasteles, a tamale with pork, plantains, raisins, and spices, for an appetizer, and it was not that great. The masa was a bit dry, and the flavors weren't as scintillating as I expected, especially for the price. 

For our entrees we had the Ropa Veija (shredded beef in spices with black beans and rice), which once again was not anything spectacular. This was the highlight of the meal, which to me is sad. The beef was a bit tough and the moros (rice and black beans mixed) was dry. Sadly, our other entree was much worse. This title is held by the Pollo Cubano (marinated chicken breast with onions). The chicken was tender on the bright side, but it was covered with onions that were disgustingly soaked in lime. The flavor was overwhelming and I could taste nothing other than lime. 

Considering the price, atmosphere, and quality of Havana Cafe's food I will never return. If you must try this restaurant, I ask you to please not order the items mentioned above."}
{"text":"Good food, nice music.  Very friendly staff.  Especially enjoyed the fried chicken and the appetizer of crushed plaintain and pork cracklings.  Very large portions and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Liked it a lot! Great waitress, just wonderful! Gaspacho soup was on spicy side, tapas were just right. Shrimps, empanadas, relleno all very good. Friend of mine ordered pulled pork, said it was delicious. Don' t come thete for atmosphere or fine dining, or you willbe a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"\"But I took three years of Spanish and I can't understand anything!\" - said my friend. It's not necessary here. Irma was helping us. When I pulled her over to inquire why she was going to cry, it was because a patron couldn't possibly eat his postre. (A general word for dessert.) Irma, our amazing server, laughed when I said I'd take his dessert. This is very laid back, chill place serving authentic food in an unassuming place.

I miss hearing my parents and family banter in their Colombian selves. Cubans apparently mix and mingle in a similar fashion. Irma wove her magic throughout the restaurant, smiling and laughing. Quite possibly the happiest woman in Phoenix. (Eventually a delicious red sangria was selected, which went down entirely too fast.)

But back to the menu. The menu is clear to understand to anyone, from any corner of the world. Yes, I had a head start as many of the dishes share palates with Colombia. However, the menu here is clearly translated into English for anyone to decipher. No need to fret. And if you're overwhelmed by choices, there are two things that might help you order. Forks designate \"Havana Signature Items\". Additionally you can opt for a Combination or Sampler plate. It's for the \"I Just Don't Know\" moments.

SEATING
I came here the night someone had their wedding reception! So yes, Havana Cafe readily can accommodate groups. With charm, sincerity and the utmost attention they can provide wonderful service to a party of two. We arrived separately on a Tuesday night around 6-ish pm. Patrons started to trickle in more so around 7pm. 

Upon arriving I learned there wasn't really a bar area to wait for my friend to arrive. No matter, I was promptly seated even though my party had not fully arrived.

FOOD
Eager to eat we ordered fried plantains. When offered an option as to how they were prepared, I jumped and asked for Tostones. The pounded green ones (vs. the sweet kind.) Salty, but not too salty, served with a side of mojo-garlic lime sauce. My mom and aunt prepare them slightly crispier, but these were still delicious.

For a meal the Ropa Vieja was divine. Humongous, but delicious. Shredded beef brisket, bell peppers, onions, tomato wine sauce and black beans over rice. I was surprised by the difference in texture of the onions on the rice vs. the brisket. It was nice to have a sweet, fresh onion on the rice. The brisket had a blended texture of spices with the vegetables. (Enough left overs for two more meals. But I'm a girl eating 3 ounces of protein in a meal.)

The night was young, and ma ' belly was full. The flan looked tempting. I'll have to send a recon mission back just for that!

And yes, the leftovers were excellent :)"}
{"text":"How does this sound?

\"Jumbo shrimp and boneless breast of chicken in a lobster broth. A touch of unsweetened chocolate, crushed almonds and hazelnuts give this Catalonian dish a unique & unforgettable flavor. Served with white rice. - Gambas y Pollo\"  

I can't speak to it's Catalonian authenticity but its flavor is gob-smackingingly divine. (Yes, it's prompted me to make up a variation of the word, \"gobsmacked.\") I especially savored the bites where I got a bit of the juicy tomato** ~ it really made the flavors sing. 

The Pollo Cubano was excellent as were the Papas Rellena. (I think even if you aren't big on cilantro, you may like the sauce - cilantro taste is very mild.) 

If I were rating on food quality alone ~ All of the dishes were easily 4 star quality - good portions, very tasty, excellent flavors & great variety from which to choose. 

The service was between 3-4 after they figured out we were there. 

The decor was a 2 when I walked in, but it grew on me ~ ok, a 3 star. I used to frequent the Phoenix location long ago when it had an upstairs and I loved that upstairs so maybe I'm too picky.

The price is between a two and three. The entrees seemed the most on the high side; appetizers and desserts a bit more in line.  

Will we come here again? You betcha. I definitely recommend you at least try it once and review for yourself! I will have a MOJITO (as many other reviewers have raved over) & a \"Brazo Gitano\" for dessert! 

** It just hit me that tomato isn't listed in ingredients and now that I'm reviewing the menu closer on-line, it does state in small print, \"Not all the ingredients of each dish are listed; we ask that you inform your server of dietary restrictions before ordering.**  

So, good thing I like tomatoes."}
{"text":"Mojito!  Probably one of the worst mojitos I ever had.  I also don't like how their patio is in a parking lot with a view of a busy street.  Bad set up."}
{"text":"I was somewhat disappointed in this restaurant. I went here today for lunch after going to the other location about 7 years ago and really enjoying it. I had a Groupon that was about to expire, so the BF and I went there for lunch. The place was fairly empty, only two other tables were full at about 12:30. I ordered the paradise pork (I think?) and he had the fried pork. Our server was very nice and spoke highly of my dish. The dish was supposed to have bell peppers and habanero peppers in it, but it was not spicy. The pork had a weird flavor to it....kind of like it was a bit old or possibly frozen, but I don't know if that is for sure the case. The bf's pork was kind of dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. When you ate the meat with the rice and beans it was alright because the rice and beans were actually pretty good. We also got the maduras which were good, a little mushier than I've had elsewhere, but good flavor. The real problem with this place is their prices. Without the groupon our lunch would have cost around 30$. That is a bit ridiculous, in my opinion. I don't think I would go here if I had to pay full price, but I might try it again if I had a discount. Overall: Don't run here, but don't run away from here."}
{"text":"Delicious Cuban and Spanish food. Paella, Sangria, Vaca frita are my favorites here. Warm ambiance,  priced right. And they also teach cooking classes unfortunately they fill up very quickly :(."}
{"text":"Where to start?  I think this Havana Cafe is having an identity crisis.  It's in a teeny little upscale-looking strip mall. But the snotty kind of upscale, not the REAL upscale that will treat you like a king even if you're driving a hoopty and dressed in rags.  The vibe that you get from the surrounding businesses is more unfriendly than I am used to.  Let me explain a bit.  There is almost no parking, but if you find a spot, it has a marker on it identifying it as belonging ONLY to a certain business.  REALLY?  There are, in effect, about 7 spots, and y'alll want to be stingy in his economy and deter business from your next door neighbor?   I don't like that.

 Back to Havana Cafe.   If I were to give my opinion, they should try for a less upscale and more cozy attitude. What they have going now is not working for me.
The entrance is rough and bumpy and leads you through the patio to the front door.  I think this could be used to their advantage to \"invite\" people into a cozy and rustic dining experience. Not what they've done.  Black plastic patio furniture with black checkered plastic tablecloths?  Yuck.  Lace curtains on the windows of the restaurant?  Yuck.
Now we're inside.  The walls are covered in a bunch of posters, prints, ads, etc.  that have a cuban theme.  It's not designed, it's not thought out, it's not even inviting. It's chaotic and unpleasant.  The chairs are the same black plastic patio furniture, The tablecloths are circa 1980 tropical covered in glass like your grandmas dresser.

After getting a load of this, the food had better be STELLAR!  well.....
We started with a couple of iced coffees.  $9 for two glasses of mostly ice.  Throughout the meal, our server kept trying to get us to order more.  At $4.50 a pop?  Back off lady!!!
Food:
We ordered the Frituras de Frijoles Negros,and the Papa Rellano.  The little black bean balls were very freshly fried.  It pretty much goes downhill from here.  For $6 you get TWO balls of papa rellano that are sour and bland at the same time. How they managed that, I have NO IDEA at all.  After tasting these two appetizers, we decided against entrees and ordered the Tapas Trio. Warning, it keeps getting worse here.  
The one single. lonely, little empanada was sour and microwaved.  The single, thin, slice of Tortilla Espanola was cold and the Sherry sauce was raw.  As in uncooked and alcoholic.  The (3 tiny) albondigas were ok.  the sauce was straight out of a jar, Heinz Mushroom gravy---and COLD.
At the end of this travesty, they provide you with a SURVEY!!!!! As if you're in Chilis!!!  It says on the survey to drop it in the box by the door.  I would have done so, if there really HAD been a box by the door.  All you see by the door are the signs telling people that they can't wear tank tops.  In Arizona? Wow.  I'm serious, Havana Cafe needs to decide what they want to be, because what they are, is....TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Went here with a living social deal. 

It included an appetizer trio, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and a choice of mojito or sangria.

The dining area was all reserved when we got here, but we got a high top in the bar area. Reservations reccomended. 

The mojito I had was pretty tasty, I wouldn't mind having a lot of these. The sangria wasn't anything special though.

The appetizers were ok. Nothing extremely special, but nothing bad either. Just meh.

I had the Sailors paella and my guest had a cuban steak with rice beans and onions. the paella was really salty and buttery. Unfortunately the seafood inside wasn't very fresh. The crab in particular was impossible to get out of the shell. It was a soft almost plasticky shell a sign of frozen and poorly cooked seafood. The steak was not a premium cut of meat. It wasn't tough but the texture felt poor and wasn't very flavorful. Fairly forgettable. 

We then got bread pudding and flan for dessert. the bread pudding was so so, but omg the flan was delicious. Very rich and very thick. 

The service here wasn't very attentive, but they were very warm and welcoming. It was a very nice atmosphere to relax and unwind. Maybe it was because we were in the bar area, but the bartender completed most of the service and it was almost like being in a friend's house with him hosting you.

If you haven't realized by now, I didn't really think very highly of the food here. It was fairly bland and forgettable. Maybe I just don't like Cuban food though. Without the living social deal the price for the meal would have been fairly expensive. I couldn't see myself spending that much for the entrees we got. The mojito and flan were good, but not good enough to draw me back here."}
{"text":"Cuban food? Never tried it? You don't know what you're missing. Havana's menu is delicious, extensive and includes the succulent Ropa Vieja. 

With respect to Lauren V.'s review, this is not Sonoran Mexican food at all and they share very few spices. There are no refried beans, no tortillas, no jalapenos, etc, etc. It is not \"picante\" food, simply well seasoned.

Currently, through October, they've added to the regular Cuban menu, themes from each Latin American country. We've enjoyed the specials from Ecuador, Guatamela and Argentina--all positively fantastic.

Certainly, most of the valley's \"cocktail nation\" has sipped a mojito(Ernest Hemingway's infamous drink) at various establishments--but, you must have one here--SUPERB!

Excellent service and guitar music on Fridays and Saturdays.

Get there with your date pronto!"}
{"text":"Groupon deals are not meant for all places. Some should avoid it like the plague, and that list includes Havana Cafe. 

The three stars are for the food; everything else needs to be overhauled. The restaurant is really tiny, and filled with plastic chairs to capacity, which affects mobility somewhat. With the Groupon deal, this problem was compounded, because by 6.30, it was already filled up. Like many reviewers have mentioned, it wouldn't hurt the waiters to smile and do some chitchat. 

The day we went, there were just two people rushing around taking orders and serving food, and another who was ushering in guests, handling the phone, and printing out the receipts. He had so much to do, that he was (not unexpectedly) making errors...as he did with our bill.

We ordered the tapas platter, which came with deliciously warm Cuban bread, and served to whet our appetites. I got the Chicharrones de Pollo, which was fried pieces of chicken dipped in spicy batter, served with a side of beans and rice and plantains. It was nice, but too dry for my taste and I wish they had been more generous with the beans.

K got the Boliche Mechado, which is roast beef stuffed with chorizo and cooked in red wine, served with a side of rice and beans. Very tasty!

The flan that we ordered for dessert more than made up for the sour service. It was made to perfection, and wasn't too sweet. 

Though the food was good, I found it overpriced, and certainly the charm you would expect from a neighborhood hangout like the 
Havana Cafe was totally missing. Also, I don't know if this happens there often, but the day we went, the electricity went out thrice, for about 5 mins each time, and we were left eating in semi-darkness! Strange!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here this evening.  We had a living social 3 course meal voucher that we had purchased a couple months ago.  The voucher expired tomorrow so EVERYONE there had a voucher and they were busy!  I dont think they were prepared for the mad rush to use the vouchers before they expired.  The wait staff were friendly but they could not keep up and the service lacked. We were never offered drink refills.  Even the water wasnt refilled.  The food was so so.  I have had MUCH better cuban food.  Mimita's in Chandler is wonderful and so much better.  The 3 course meal included a small plate of appetizers.  We got Ropa Vieja and Bistec Encebollado as main courses and two orders of flan for desert.  The flan was cut in 1/2, they tried to make it last obviously.  We heard them tell another table that came in after us that they ran out of regular flan and asked if coconut flan would be ok instead.  So why were we not offered something different in a regular portion size, rather than cut it in 1/2 which was very obvious that they did to make due.  We did dine here once before a few months back and I wasnt overly impressed but when I saw the living social deal, I thought we could give it another try.  Definitely not a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"I came to the Phoenix location for lunch through Groupon.  I ordered the beef brisket called Ropa Vieja, which was very tough and like eating strands of rope.  I could see where it got it's name \"ropa\", because it is like cooked strands of rope. There was plenty of meat, but the flavor was all boiled and leached out of the meat.  It was served to me like a stew , but the beans and rice side and the ropa was swimming in a plateful of water almost to the edge of the plate.  The ropa stew had no flavor, like it was boiled in a big potful of plain water that kept getting changed.  I had to add a lot of salt., shake more and more and more salt on it.   It was very ICK to me.   I wish I ordered the cerviche instead.  I didn't think the ropa was worth it even with the Groupon discount, I would not want that dish even if it were free, unless I was starving.  I told the waitress it was very bland and asked her if it was normal to have all that water in the plate.   She said it was \"juicey\", but to me, juice implies flavor, but I guess \"juice\" for water is a waitress being positive and politically correct on her job.   My jaws were tired trying to chew the strands of \"rope\".  She did not offer to bring me something else.  She said that was the way it was.

For dessert, I ordered the coconut mini flan with mango sauce, and that was really good!   I'd give it an A and the size was larger than the word mini implies.  

Sorry for such  negative review about the ropa, but I tell it like it is, and if I thought it was terrific, I'd surely say so.

Maybe you will find something else on the menu to your liking, or maybe you are less discriminating than I am about tough and flavorless Ropa meat swimming in a plateful of water  (Yes, I know the difference between juice, sauce, soup, and water.).   I consider myself a great cook and I eat out a lot.  

I only tried this Ropa, and it is not good enough to make me wanna give this restaurant another change at my own cost.   The waitress was very nice and attentive though, I have no complaints about her service, but she did not offer me a substitute.  I would have given it a one star, but she was a friendly and attentive waitress."}
{"text":"First visit and was shocked at the prices for Cuban food in a strip mall. Had the Pollo Cubano and it was too sweet.  Couldn't believe that the entrées don't come with plantains given the high price ( $17! ) for chicken, rice & beans. Service was friendly but lacked proper attention and followup. Couldn't get a water refill until after I was finished with my meal. Again, for the price, service should be much better. Asked the busser for the check and the manager brought it over and asked how everything was and I shrugged and said \"eh, ok \"  and he just walked away! Apparently had he didn't want to know more."}
{"text":"Food here is great pretty much everything on the menu is delicious they even have Portuguese beer the desert was very yummy  the waitress was very friendly will be back again"}
{"text":"This restaurant is consistently one of our favorites and we ALWAYS take company there when we have them in town.  The menu is imaginative and fresh!  The staff is very helpful and prompt.  You must have the Calypso chips when you go.  The Carribean Candy Bar for dessert is definately shareable.  Try it!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times, twice on a groupon twice for Happy Hour.  The Happy Hour specials could be a little better from a price perspective and the martinis are very weak, but the food is pretty good. I've had the black bean fritters which are slightly greasy but very tasty, the dates and chorizo...it works but I prefer bacon, almond, date.  The tostones had a nice crunch and went well with the black bean dip or the mojo sauce.  The real reason I come though is for the Masas de Puerco Fritas.  The bartender Steve recommended it one night and I am forever grateful.  The pork is a nice size portion, very tender yet  perfectly crisped.  The beans and rice are very flavorful, and topped with red onion.  I like to pour the mojo sauce on everything and then order some of their homemade habenaro sauce to compliment...beware very spicy.  The service is always good there, very nice people.  I even ordered dessert there one time, cant recall what I ordered but it had a ton of chocolate, very decadent.  I was full but managed to scarf it all down without a hitch."}
{"text":"Me gusta comida de cubano!

I came here with a friend, and we used a Groupon.  I have heard a lot of great things from coworkers and friends about this small little place in Arcadia Phoenix area.  I have driven by it several times, and it was finally time to get a feel of Cuba.

The waiter gave us a very homey and family type feeling with the passion he showed by explaining the menu.  I ordered the Pollo Cubano, which has grilled chicken with savory sweet onions on top and a side of black beans and rice.  The onions gave a dynamic sweetness and yumminess that I can't explain with words.  My friend ordered dried plantains.  The first order had black beans inside, and the other was almost like a sweet plantain banana dessert.  We enjoyed the food family style with some beer.

I will definitely have to make a return trip to Havana Cafe!"}
{"text":"Never been to Cuba... probably don't ever wanna go to Cuba... so I don't know why such an intense craving to try Cuban food came over us on a random Friday night; but it did. Enter Havanna Café... the best/most reviewed Cuban place on Yelp in the greater Phoenix area. 

We went to the Scottsdale location which is nestled in a random little strip mall... if you didn't know any better you'd probably assume it's some no frills neighborhood diner, but how wrong you'd be... just beyond those stucco walls is a nice quaint Cuban restaurant with dozens upon dozens of dishes most people have never even heard of before. 

We were sat down right next to a live Cuban band... bongo drums and all... they were belting out some pretty groovy tunes. The main singer had a deep scratchy voice and a heavy Cuban accent... and he said 'wooooooooooow' a lot... this combined with the décor of the place really did make it feel like you were really in Cuba, very fun! We decided to order a schmorgisborg of stuff... what follows is a list of what we got along with a brief description:

Calypso Chips - Fried Plantains w/ black bean dip... damn good... good chips and salsa alternative. 

Frituras de Frijoles Negros - Deep fried balls of black beans w/ avocado dip... heavenly.

Dátiles con Chorizo - Chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon... very unique flavor.

Papa Rellena - Meat stuffed in a ball of fried potatoes in a bed of cream sauce... pretty decent though a bit rich. 

Tamal Cubano - A Cuban ground corn tamale with pork and other random goodness, it was alright but not quite good enough to specifically recommend.  

Potage de Frijoles Negros - A black bean soup... a little too 'beany' if that makes any sense. Made a good dip for the black bean balls though. 

On top of all that we tried a couple of imported Cuban sodas... both were pretty different, but tasted great. The meal was very fun... flavors were all over the place; if you're a fan of trying new things then this should be high on your list. The Tapas section of the appetizer is quite extensive and you can easily make a fun and varied meal by getting nothing but appetizers. 

This place is easily recommendable for any of the more adventurous foodies out there; you'll have a lot of fun at this place trying some new things. For us, this place was more of a novelty, to try once just for the experience... but depending on your pallet I could see this place swooping in a stealing a lot of business from other more bland Mexican and ethnic restaurants nearby.  4/5."}
{"text":"i've had florida's cuban food made with love from cubans. i didn't know that some of their boats floated out to the desert in arizona. whoever their navigator was must have been drunk from salt water. though arizona should throw them a parade because they brought some awesome flavors to the land of beige from their $3 mojitos (all day on monday) to their gambas y pollo. 

the only major thing that was lacking on my visit was timeliness by the kitchen. we waited quite a bit for our entree; though i blame it on a large meeting held in the next room. i knew that they were busting their butts because the chefs himself brought out our food (without a \"this is hot\" caution). it was pipping hot enough to burn my tongue but the flavors still came through."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The menu looked great and we were very excited to try some delicious Cuban food. Sadly the menu was the only thing right about this place.

The first time we tried there wasn't a single parking spot in front, around the side or in back. The location isn't worth the rustic charm it's going for if no one can park.

The second time we got a parking spot by the dumpsters in back! Luckily we happen to be forgiving when it comes to delicious food so we put that aside. The place is dying for a makeover inside but I'm a sucker for holes in the wall so that's not going to stop us. 

However, what will stop us is horrible service on top of all of this. We tried to flag down our waiter for over 20 minutes because our water was out and we wanted to order. Instead he had some very important socializing and scratching to do with the other staff that was doing nothing. When we got up to walk out it didn't even phase them.

A small place, like this, can stay alive on delicious food but you have to feed your customers for this to work."}
{"text":"I love Cuban restaurants. I guess I have to face it. The staff here is extremely nice. We came in for lunch, and were early so it was not crowded.  The black bean soup was perfect. The rice was excellent. I would have like a bit more pork shoulder on my cuban sandwich. It was toasted just right with the cheese gooey.  The fried bananas were just right. The Cuban tamale was as good as always.  i could not figure ot how a Cuban Restaurant would not have any Cuban Coffee on the day we were there?? Oh well you can't hit it perfect every day."}
{"text":"One of our favorites!  Great Cuban food - excellent service. Always look forward to a wonderful dining experience here and even if it takes almost an hour to drive here, we still will make every effort to be here often."}
