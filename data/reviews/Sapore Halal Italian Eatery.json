{"text":"I would not recommend this place to even my worst enemy.
The cajun pasta has an annoying kick to it that does not welcome a second bite. The lasagna caused avid stomache pain and costs $10 for a 3inch by 3 inch slice. Beyond that the owner cut off 10% from the Dine Halal discount when on their website they said 15%, PLUS he overcharged the meal (i guess he charged for water?). This place is mediocre and the service is not pleasent especially not when it comes time to pay; you would expect a little gratitude upon leaving but nope they dont give a shit after they receive payment.

Don't eat here its overpriced food for little quantity, i recommend going to Cajun way on Latimer drive , now that place gives you bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Italian home style food. Service was very nice and prompt, but the place is new and all.. affordable and OK taste. Hope they keep the quality good over time."}
