{"text":"One of the best pho places in the city. I would know because I've eaten pho from Vietnam to California and several cities in Canada. Pho Jade is one of the few places left who actually use beef bone to make their beef broth(I've seen the huge pot with the bone sticking out). If you know pho, most places mix chicken broth or add pre made beef broth with too much msg. Stick to the beef pho and fresh rolls here. You can't go wrong. The grilled meat and other dishes aren't the greatest or the worst but I wouldn't recommend it to others. If you want better pho there isn't many other choices unless you wanna fly to Orange County in Cali. There are also some great places in the west end of Toronto or sauga but why bother if your in the downtown area. And for those of you who think pho in Vietnam is better you've never been there or still live there and haven't traveled. This is just my honest opinion. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! The food is always fresh ,the portions are large and the prices are economical .The service is always good, the server always remembers me and my order .. I would recommend this place to many"}
{"text":"Not the place for fast service. Took a while to get our order in. Seemed like take-out was faster than dining in. Service was terribly slow as there was only one person. Ordered a chicken salad, fresh rolls and vermicelli. When the food finally arrived after 30 mins, the salad looked pretty sad for $9 and there was a long piece of black hair in the vermicelli. Obviously can't comment on the food here."}
{"text":"The bowl of pho arrived to the table as if it was half eaten, half a fish ball, half a squid, 1 shrimp. Another large size pho came with small piece of shredded beef, half the bowl was empty with the equivalent noodle portion of a small. Did they run out of food? 
Besides that, the broth only tasted of sodium, not that deep and complex broth found in authentic pho. There is definitely much better places in the neighborhood. Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill over the years. The bathrooms are so dirty. No soap. Not sure how anyone washes their hands. My wife confirmed the women's washroom is just as bad. 

As for the food it's ok. Rare beef Pho is decent but the broth lacks real complexity. Also the beef portions get smaller every time I've come. This will be our last visit after 4 years of eating here."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice service.  We had mango tempura avocado rolls,  pho and pad thai and it was all delicious."}
{"text":"The decor of the restaurant is rather upscale for the neighbourhood it's in. I ordered a standard pho noodle dish and some shrimp rolls. When the shrimp rolls came, I discovered that each shrimp had been thinly sliced in half, so what looked like it should've been three full shrimp rolled up, I got one-and-a-half shrimp. They position them so you can't easily see they're cut in half unless you look for it. As well, the meat servings in my pho noodles were less generous than other pho restaurants. The general quality and flavour of the food was fine. I just felt cheated on the quantity."}
{"text":"Overpriced compared to other Pho Restaurants. They do not put very much meat in the soup. I have eaten here about 6 times,once the broth of the pho was very weak tasting and the beef was very tough. I think they are doing a better job now but they give you about half the average amount of meat which makes it not worth the high price."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite pho place in my neighbourhood. I have had better pho but that doesn't mean this place doesn't get a 5. Awesome, polite, quick staff. Delicious, big, well-priced bowls of pho."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Used to come here often and the portions were generous and the place was clean. I'm not sure if it's under new ownership, but the handles on the bathroom doors were FILTHY, my husband told me there was no soap in the men's bathroom, the floor felt like there was a layer of cleaner on it, which made it very slippery when coming in off the street out of the rain. Now for the food, the vermicelli and grilled chicken was half of its former glory--one spring roll instead of two, a minuscule piece of grilled chicken, but a huge portion of plain vermicelli noodles. The pickled radish and carrots were mushy and rancid-tasting. It was gross. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is clean and nice. The pho was really good! The avocado milkshake is nice and refreshing - not overly sweet, and delicious!

They do not have wifi set up for guests (in case you were wondering)."}
{"text":"This place is full of great service and a nice atmosphere that can't be beat.  Compared to most Vietnamese places in Toronto, the servers and owners are very welcoming, nice and make you feel at home.  I come here once in a while with my co-workers and we are always treated well and given some house specials on occasion too!

The food is authentic and the presentation is much nicer than most Vietnamese places around the city.  The restaurant itself is kept very clean and it's very well lit by the large open glass windows out front.

Overall I really enjoy this place, along with the super friendly staff.  Even when they are swamped, they still have time to chat and make sure everyone is doing well with their food.  A great Vietnamese destination in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Really decent and large portions. Pho was quite nice as was the vermicelli and BBQ pork. Had a Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. Ultra sweet and ultra strong. Service was also attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Used to come here often and then for about a year I didn't come anymore. 

Today, after a long day at work I was driving in the area and I felt in need to have some comfort food and especially hot since today is very cold. So here I am again. 

Jade pho is still run by the same owner and the service is still handle by the same server who's demonstrated to handle the service in the same fast and efficient way. 
I had the old classic dish: house special which consist in rice noodles with beef, beef tendons, cartilages, meatballs, beef tripes all served in a delicious homemade beef broth.
The whole bowl comes as usual with the boost of cilantro, mint leafs and sprouts. 

The only downside I believe that the amount of side greens has been reduced. Not so sure why but as far as my memory can recall from my recent trip to Vietnam, the serving of herbs is usually very very generous because that's what Vietnamese love to death when they are having pho. 

Now, believe me when I say that I do understand that we are not in Vietnam here, but since before the portions of mint, cilantro and sprouts were more abundant than what I observed today, and knowing that the owner is Vietnamese, I was expecting the same quantity: no more no less. 

Overall Pho Jade is still a very good place for the quality they serve but this time I want to adjudicate only 3 stars just because I found the portion of the greens reduced.

{"text":"This restaurant is definitely not what it used to be.  Back when it was Pho My Duyen with different owners, it was always our family favourite for good ol' traditional Vietnamese fare with great portions, good pricing and upscale ambiance.  Now Pho Jade, portions have gotten conspicuously smaller over time and given the portions, much pricier. Just had a very underwhelming family dinner.  Hubby ordered a rice dish with grilled chicken, beef and spring roll and the rice was a very stingy portion, spring roll was thin and sparsely filled and grilled meats left more to the imagination.  My Pho special lacked the usual variety in meats expected of a special.  Even the broth tasted almost like pseudo-flavoured booking water.  We don't claim to be culinary experts and love to support neighbourhood restaurants but were very disappointed.  Definitely saddened to see the gradual demise of this family fav and likely won't be coming here ever again.  Best to stick with the other Vietnamese restaurants on nearby College Street!"}
{"text":"Nicely done up but not overly tasty. The beef and egg with broken rice was probably a bit better than the rare beef and tendon pho and the grilled chicken and pork vermicelli. The pho was ok but had a very high noodle to good stuff ratio and the broth wasn't particularly rich or tasty. The vermicelli was disappointing with fairly tasteless meat and less of the pickled carrots/lettuce/cucumber and other things than I'm used to elsewhere. 
Portions were decent, service friendly and reasonably quick.
All in all I much prefer our usual places up on St. Clair or down on Ossington. We don't plan to return here."}
{"text":"I usually stick to the house special pho and whatever fresh rolls I'm feeling that day and it's consistently great, I usually drop by at least 3 times a month, even more so during rainy days(pho is best when its raining for some reason) the prices are pretty reasonable as well, you can eat like a royalty for under $20.(I don't know what that one guy is talking about saying it's overpriced, get your broke ass outta here son) 4 stars since the ambience stills throws me off a bit from time to time, and they aren't open so late. I'd pick this spot anyday over golden turtle not just cause the location is convenient for me but the service is also impeccable."}
{"text":"This place looks very clean and can tell that can attractive be non asians(since many pho places r quite dirty even with amazin food). Pho was kinda small for the price and they dont have xl size. Meat and soup was legit without any fat oil floatin around.

Decent place to go for a meal wit girls but not with ur sasauge party hungry monsters."}
{"text":"Besides that they're right in my hood, this spot is my fave. They are truly lovely people and always greet me with a smile. I've taken many a friends there and all love the experience. I usually get the Rare Beef Pho but have ordered other items off the menu. The pho is the best stuff off the menu. It's affordable, consistently delicious and satisfying - the perfect trifecta. If you know what Soursop is, try their smoothie, it's amazing. Everytime I visit, I know what to expect and my expectations are always met. Word of Advice - avoid the Pad Thai and anything off the Vietnamese food path - Pho is the best way to go with this place."}
{"text":"I went there cause I was sick with a cold.... Very nice location the restaurant is very big inside.. the soup was great I would go there again"}
{"text":"I was very surprised when we got there, nice place, nice bathrooms, the waitress was serious but then after understand that this was the only person working, there was noone else to help but even more surprising that this girl.managed to serve everysingle customer fast, she didnt forget anything and she didnt stop one second since we got there going from one table to the other my respects for this girl. 
*The food was ok, nothing special, I have tried better Pho the cold rolls were not tasty at all abd the springrolls were super greasy :( ohhhhh shame.
But we were so impress by this girl and her efficiency to serve 20 customers without a single mistake!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place on my own a few years back. I thank my lucky stars I did. 

It's a really nice place, it has great service, great prices and amazing food."}
{"text":"One of the more cleaner Vietnamese restaurants I have   been to.  Nice decor and good service.  Food is up to par with other Vietnamese places other than one obvious flaw.  The portions are miniscule.  There were 2 meatballs in the bowl which would have been acceptable if they weren't the size of peanut.  Similar dilemma with the spring roll and grilled beef."}
{"text":"Woah. I slept on this place for the longest time.

I've been living around the corner from Pho Jade for over two years and I never paid a visit until today. When walking by I could never gauge what was going on in there, but happened to stumble in and check out the menu. Lots of promising choices.

Place looks pretty good. I'd dine in for sure. Woman serving me was great as well.

I ordered some kind of udon noodle dish with chicken. It was pretty good. Also got some shrimp tempura roll with avocado, which was really delicious -- filling with a touch of sweetness. Enjoyed my selections very much.

Really happy I decided to finally check this place out. Looking forward to exploring their menu some more! 

Oh, and they have a water fountain and big screen TV. 

Boom."}
{"text":"Jade is a good neighbourhood pho spot when you feel like a quick and inexpensive meal. 

The pho has a really nice broth, just as good as Golden Turtle in my opinion.

Vermicelli is also good, but could definitely stand to have more meat in it.

Their iced coffee is delicious, but I'm not sure why it comes in a plastic cup and not a drinking glass?"}
{"text":"Try the Bun Bo Hue. It's a delicious spicy sour variation from the normal broth. Restaurant is very clean, spacious and great service. Doesn't get crowded like Golden Turtle. Definitely my favorite pho place in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went here today for a Valentines dinner with my mom. When you first come in, you have to find your own seat. And write down your order and the lady just comes and picks it up. The entire time she never gave us water!!! I asked for extra food, which I know will be extra. Because the food is not fulling at all. But it was the only restaurant  near by because everything else in my area is busy. So when I got the food, the food looked exactly like how I usually get it. So I got up after eating and waited in line to pay for the dinner I just had and I brought up my concerns to the lady and she started acting like she didn't know what I was talking about at all. She just stood there blinking at me and smirking, and saying I charged you for extra tofu. I know that but there was no extra tofu! The food is very simple and it's not filling. But usually when I go there the lady that's regularly there is nice. But the food not being filling and the service sucks. I won't ever be back! The lady who served me today should be fired! She has no customer service skills at all."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I was a pho virgin as most places use a beef broth base.

Pho Jade kindly offers a vegetarian broth version for us herbivores that is truly ...scrumptious!  The spring rolls are also amazing. The prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are very generous. 2 thumbs up. I'm trying to work up the courage to try the durian fruit milkshake next time"}
{"text":"This place is really clean, and the food is fresh, cheap and delicious! We live in the area and go there several times a month now. Stick to the Vietnamese basics (pho, vermicelli, fresh rolls etc) and you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Meh. Much better pho paces around. The chicken is grissly. It is really clean!! Which is a huge positive. Staff are nice and lots of big TV's with the Jays game on!"}
{"text":"Mediocre in every way. Watery Hoisin sauce, mostly noodles and very few veggies, the meat wasn't tasty... The whole meal was bland and salty with none of the flavour I associate with Vietnamese food. I don't like leaving bad reviews for small family-run places but honestly the food here is not good. It feels like they have cut a lot of corners to keep prices down and the quality has really suffered."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious pho.  Inexpensive and good portion for the price.  I always order the P14 (flank brisket, tripe, and beef ball) and sugar cane shrimps (two pieces).  
The sugar cane shrimps are not on the menu, I would recommend trying this dish.  It's seasoned minced shrimp paste wrapped around a long (about 6\") rectangular peeled sugar cane, then deep fried to a beautiful golden colour.  The salty and sweet combination is quite a treat in your mouth.  Don't forget to spit out the sugar cane once you done chewing out all the sugary goodness.  Don't order this if you're on a hot date and wanna look proper (but who would take a hot date to a pho place?!).  
The broth of the pho is not too greasy, and it's tasty enough without adding any sauce.  
The staff is always friendly there, although there would be a long wait if you're a big group of people (over 10).  There were several times I waited an hour for my food.  The place is clean and big, but they only have one server, I feel bad for her when the place is packed.  If you are a big group, you can call ahead and order your food, so you don't have to wait too long when you're at the restaurant."}
{"text":"As phor as vegetarian pho goes (see what I did there?) in the Brockton/Bloordale area, this is the best I have had yet! The vegetables were fresh and cooked to perfection, the noodles actually had flavor and were not \"waxy\" like I usually find pho rice noodles to be, the tofu was quality, and the broth was so flavorful. Not at all boring and plain, like I usually find vegetarian pho to be. 

My partner had beef pho, and also said that it was the best he has had in the neighborhood. This is exciting!  

The service was fast and friendly, the restaurant was clean and open, the food was ready what felt like only 5 minutes after ordering, and the price was right. My vegetarian pho was $6.95 and my partner's beef pho was $7.50. Next time I'll try their pad thai."}
{"text":"So far the best, cheap pho I've been able to find in Toronto. Nice decor inside, it's never too busy, and the staff is really nice. Have been here a few times and have always had a good experience."}
{"text":"Impressive food, great price, and nice decor. 

I had a seafood dish, but my table of four ordered beef, chicken and a noodle dish. Everyone felt that their food was quickly prepared and tasty.

Taste-wise, probably one or the best Pho places I have been to, with some of the nicest decor, at average Toronto pricea. Win win!

If I could name one downside it would be its location - which is sadly about two blocks west of where you would hope it would be. But still worth finding!"}
{"text":"Ordered for home delivery here. Food came in hot and well packed. Ordered the Goi Cuon Tom and Tom Ga Pad Thai, loved the 2 Cuon!! It comes with 2 different dips, which were delicious. The portions are really great and the value for money is good. I was full with the appetiser itself. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
