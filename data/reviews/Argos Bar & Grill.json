{"text":"For a small town bar this place packs some goodness. 
Their rotisserie chicken quesadia is divine. The service is good, typical small town feel. All you can eat smelt on Friday nights, reasonably priced drinks. We will be back, believe me."}
{"text":"hoping i have the right place, i am almost certain i do....

classic small town bar.  cluttered with signs & shit they've gathered over the years.  unkept areas that would be better off cleaned rather than storing whatever is currently sitting in the spot.  older bartender that knows when you are ready for a beer and makes a strong drink.  

walk in front door and the bar is on the left or north side.  lower eating tables scattered opposite and close to the entrance.  a pool table in the rear near the restrooms.  horrible tiled ceiling that is stained from smoking in the years gone by.

what really sets argos bar apart is the old school bar & bar back.  on the east side of the bar are cabinets that no doubt at one time sold liquor sold to the public.  classic chicago style liquor cabinets that still stores bottle today.  next the the cabinet hangs a classic chip rack with clips.  the bar back is old signage, beer mirrors, & bottle shelves.  the bar top itself appears to have been refinished recently.  has a classic rounded spill rail.  the bar face is a worn wooden surface that does not include an overhang.  a box foot rest.  bar top also includes an older postage stamp machine.  really curious who still purchases stamps today, but why not at the bar.

relaxed atmosphere.  dying to go back sometime on a thur-fri-sat night."}
