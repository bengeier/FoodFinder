{"text":"Let's just start by saying it's a BYOW restaurant !  The place is very nicely decorated. The ambiance is nice and cozy with  good music playing in the background to make your dinning experience just amazing.  I suggest you to reserve on week-ends just because it get's busy after 6 pm which is normal for good places such as this one.  Let's talk about the VERY GOOD FOOD !  Fresh fish exported all the way from Japan. I was not a big fan of sashimi  (raw sliced fish ) until I got to taste for the very first time a variety of fresh, raw fish platter  accompanied of fresh sea food ! If you want to try something different and you're not afraid of newness, then you've got to order the DEGUSTATION MENU and the price is reasonable for the quality of the food (85 $ for 2 person). Give it a try and you won't regret it !"}
{"text":"Je n'avais jamais essayé de menu dégustation de sashimi et je vous confirme que c'est une des plus belle decouverte de ma vie haha  J'ai rarement mangé du poisson aussi frais et servis avec des assaisonnements d'aussi grande qualité ! De A à Z le repas etait parfait !   De plus, cest un apportez votre vin, alors pour 85$ (pour les 2 personnes) vous aurez un excellent repas de 3 services et vous n'aurez pas a payer l'alcool :)   Une experience plus que parfaite !"}
{"text":"Had a reservation at 8 and waited in a crowded area for 20mins at the front. All the staff looked like they were running around doing nothing. Everyone was standing around staring at empty tables."}
{"text":"This should be read as a 4.5 stars.  Awesome service. As we stepped in the restaurant, we were greeted by the waiter immediately. Right as we sat down, he came to explain the special catch that they have that are not listed on the usual menu (Uni, O-toro, etc.). All along dinner, he made sure the food was to our liking.  We took the Omakase, which is the tasting menu. It is made for 2 people and is 85$. Good price and quality food. The fish were fresh. The Omakase menu changes according to the fish they get, so it's not always the same things... Must not forget that some of the fish are directly delivered from the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo! One of the dish was Suzuki sashimi with jalapenos and caviar in yuzu citrus sauce. It was such a good combination! It was one of my favorite dish of the meal. And then we got a sashimi platter and some sushi and maki. All fresh and good! In that platter, I must point out the foie gras salmon. It was super good. I was hesitant in the beginning, but it tasted great! We also took on the side O-Toro (fatty tuna) and Uni. Both were good. Of course not comparable to what I had in Japan, but one of the best that I've had in Montreal for its price (quality vs price)!   The one thing that makes them a 4.5 stars is that with the sashimi/sushi/maki platter, they did not serve any ginger or wasabi. Usually, ginger is used to remove the taste of the previous fish so you can taste the next piece better...  Might become my go to sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Love that it is a bring your own wine so the price is a bonus. The sushi and sashimi are both extremely fresh. Will definitely be going back. Highly recommend this gem."}
{"text":"A nicely decorated bring your own wine resto in Greenfield Park with friendly attentive staff. Ambiance is nice with slow jazz playing in background.  We had the filet mignon which comes on a sizzling plate with veggies. The menu claims that it's AAA quality but I beg to differ. We order medium and it came medium rare (no biggie) but it was the kind of steak where you have to chew each piece for an eternity before you can swallow it. The teriyaki sauce was abundant and unnecessary. I've had better filet mignon from Provigo.  The sushi platter for 2 has a nice variety of their signature sushi dishes. The star being the dragon eye which is dipped and fried in tempura.  However after a while it gets boring and you get tired of eating it. The tom yum soup is nice and has pieces of pineapple in it which is original. The salmon tar tar appetizer was also very good.  I've been here before many times for lunch and their lunch menu is a nice quick meal with colleagues or clients.   Overall for a sushi restaurant on the south shore it's above average, but if you're looking for 4 or 5 star a 10 minute drive to the 514 is necessary."}
{"text":"Les meilleures makis de mon coin . Nous apprécions la grande fraîcheur des aliments et le staff sympathique et professionnel . N'oubliez pas de réserver , car cet 'apportez votre vin ' est souvent complet ."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices and excellent service. This place is a hidden gem and worth the visit. Everything that has been tried so far, after many visits, has been mouth watering. A definite must."}
{"text":"GROS GROS coup de coeur pour ce restaurant de sushis et poissons crus de la Rive-Sud! Je travaille en haut de ce restau et j'y suis allée seulement après deux ans de côtoiement (mot inventé). on a CA-PO-TÉ. D'abord, c'est un apportez votre vin (génial!), ensuite, nous avons pris le menu dégustation qui est à 35$ par personne je crois, et WOW!! Tu en as abondamment pour ton argent! Les assiettes sont toutes meilleures les unes que les autres, les poissons sont tellement frais qu'ils fondent en bouche et le mariage des goût est à couper le souffle!!!  J'ai tellement hâte d'y retourner que j'en salive! C'est un merveilleux restaurant bien bien au-dessus des autres restaurants de sushi!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and we had the 4 handrolls special and the maki/nigiri special. Quality of the food is good especially the maguro nigiri, fish color was red-bright and taste buttery so it means freshness! The quality is close to want i ate at Maguro Brothers in HI which specialized in tuna. The tuna served at Shoji tasted better than the generic tuna in the Sushi Shop that taste usually a-bit frozen and plasticky.  So good job on the fish quality to the chef. Lunch prices are very good, include a salad or soup also. I will definitely come back during for dinner and try their specialities. They are offering fresh catches off the menu which can be very interesting. Good sushi place"}
{"text":"The sushi was so fresh. I've been here before many years ago and I remember liking it. This time i went with three other couples and we ordered the omakase which was $85 per couple. It's cheap and the sushi was good! It's fancy sushi too with truffle and foie gras and BYOB!!!!  I will definitely be back!! My favorite was the torched salmon nigiri with truffle sauce, ikura and uni. We also got albacore and other sashimi and two rolls. We also got a tartare in a martini glass.   I definitely recommend this sushi resto especially if you are on the south shore!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Great service. I don't think i'll ever be able to eat at an all you can eat restaurant anymore."}
