{"text":"One of the best Chinese Buffets. Great selection and great cooking. Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs-food is worse than mediocre-it's horrible. Should be renamed ickybahn. The people who gave positive reviews have obviously never eaten good Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"The buffet was decent but avoid the sushi at all costs.  I had to spit it out in my napkin.  It was honestly the foulest tasting food I have eaten all year."}
{"text":"I am still at the restaurant and needed to say what a nice experience for sushi buffet. Everyone is friendly and food is top notch.   I travel a lot for work and this is one of the top places I have been for everything i need in a restaurant. Quick, inexpensive, good quality food that is healthy."}
{"text":"I don't do the buffet style meals often but a coworker just insisted that we go try this place.  This was surprisingly clean and had a very large selection of dishes one could try. I tried a little bit of their sushi California rolls which was edible but not overly satisfying. I was reluctant to try any of the sushi that had fish in it because you know, it's a buffet and who knows. Then I did the hibachi grill which was okay, probably the healthiest thing in the place since I loaded my dish up with fresh veggies to be sauteed on the grill. The price was only $6.99 for lunch. So I guess it is A-ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them a 1 star, but because of the food selections and options of Hibachi, I will give them a two. I was in town after Carowinds and wanted some Chinese food with option. We did a google search on our phone and found this place since we were staying near the airport. ****WARNING***** THIS PLACE DOESN\"T PROVIDE A/C even if it is 100 degree outside.  First of all, the exterior appearance is not appealing at all. It looks old, outdated, crumbling, and parking lot was just dirty and trashy. But because sometime you can't judge a book from the outside of its cover. We decided to give them a try. When we looked at the food selection and the price. We thought that it wasn't too bad and sat down. Now comes the bad part. Today was 98 degrees outside with a feel like 105 degree. NO A/C. It was hot, humid, and muggy. I couldn't even eat my food without swallowing my own sweat. The seat we were seated was torn and duct taped. . The walls were busted, dirty, and some of the wallpaper were peeling. The ceiling had yellow stain, and the ceiling fans were dirty. The bathroom was like a murder scene when I tried to wash my hand before heading to the buffet. DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY and DISGUSTING! Now when you think of it, think of how it is in the kitchen. The food were very salty which was meant for you to down on your drink to fill you up instead of being full on the food. Food was just too salty, so I didn't even finish my first plate. Because of no A/C and it felt like a oven in that place. We left after 5 minute not even trying to explore the hibachi or sushi selection they had.  Will I return? A big fat NO! Do I recommend. NO!"}
{"text":"I did not try much of the buffet items. I mainly have only sushi and hibachi at Asian buffet places because they seem fresher (this has been my experience in other places).   At this Ichiban, the sushi was okay. The hibachi was so greasy, which made me lose my appetite. Overall, the food was mediocre at best. The one on Albemarle Rd is better."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting Charlotte North Carolina for a business trip. We came to this restaurant because of the reviews we had seen. My husband and I are disappointed. Just about every hot food item that we chose was lukewarm or cold.  However, therr was a very large food selection, tasty and service was very good."}
{"text":"Just a reminder, for special holidays, they're still open.  But dinner price whole day.  That cn be understood.  Still a good place to eat for price, quality and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Chinese buffet with addition of hibachi grill to order and sushi. Hibachi is the best. Get what you want and it's cooked for you. Buffet was a buffet. Nothing stellar. But again, it's a buffet."}
{"text":"I had my very first sushi at Ichiban 21 years ago, when I was only 17 years old.   My friend Kristen and I dared each other to try raw fish; and while I was put off by it at first, I found myself craving sashimi the very next day.  Two decades later, I'm hooked.  I've eaten sushi at dozens of other restaurants, but Ichiban is by far my favorite, and I go there at least a few times every month.  They have honestly NEVER served me a bad piece of fish, and they aren't heavy on sauce like a lot of other Americanized sushi restaurants.  The first roll I ever purchased, the Ichiban Roll (a small version of the Rainbow Roll) is my favorite to this day.  While I agree with some other reviewers that the non-sushi offerings are not great, those are simply not the reason to come to Ichiban -- just like you shouldn't go to an American seafood restaurant and expect them to have a good hamburger.  That being said, the hibachi scallops are good, the pho is excellent, and the homemade strawberry cake with kiwi (made by the owner's wife) is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  It puts Dewey's next door to shame, and reminds me that Vietnam (the homeland of the owner) was once a french colony.  Great food, great staff (they keep the same servers year after year), and a friendly owner.  I can safely say that Ichiban is one of my favorite restaurants in Winston-Salem."}
{"text":"Holy God this place sucks. It is the worst Chinese buffet I've ever had in my life. I read the negative reviews and thought there's no way that this place could be as bad as they said it was. But it is.  From the poor service to the fried chicken that tasted like fish. It was horrible. Have no idea how this place stays in business. It must all come from people staying at the motels that have never been there before and don't believe the Yelp reviews like me.  There is an older review from a lady that says she wishes that she had went to the Waffle House across the street I wish I had as well. It was so bad in the middle of dinner my stomach started turning. I left the restaurant certain that I would get diarrhea during the night. Thank goodness I didn't."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about.. this is convenient since it's close to the airport, but the food was nothing special.   There is a LOT of food at this place, but in my opinion it's your typical Chinese buffet. They do have a hibachi station and sushi station. I would recommend eating from those two.   Price is reasonable and there is tons of parking."}
{"text":"Good sushi, large selection, there should be more attention to cups for soup. Also the booths are worn... But overall 2* would be appropriate."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the carpet was so sticky it will pull your shoes off!  Service was fine but this place could use a good cleaning!"}
{"text":"Really good food every time I come!  this is where I come when I dont really know what I want since they have a huge variety of foods to choose from. And you can even have the chef stir fry you something up from ingredients you choose included in the buffet price!"}
{"text":"Generic Asian buffet featuring mix of foods from across the region. It's a bit of a dive.   Selection: B Food quality: B- Service: C Ambiance etc: C- Price: B+ (good value)"}
{"text":"I just ate there Friday March 30 more filthy than I have ever seen it. Food was all over floor and lord knows where else. Done here. Will most likely call health department on Monday. IMO stay away."}
{"text":"Humongous buffet for a great price! Sushi, Desserts, Hibachi, and everything in between. This place is one of my families absolute favorites!"}
{"text":"if you're looking for a cheap meal ($13 for dinner) with plenty of choices, this is the place for you!  Lots of choices, mainly chicken dishes and a few seafood options.  The American dishes looked overcooked, dry, and unappetizing, but I noticed quite a few kids going for them."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Our sever was Rude but overall it was good. The food tasted fresh. The sushi was ok. They also had an hibachi grill and it had a lot to choose from. My boyfriend said the banana pudding was good. Overall it was good ."}
{"text":"I'll start and say the waiter was nice. The food was cold, not ice cold but not hot like it should be. Noodles were hard, no flavor  in the egg rolls, beef or chicken w/ broccoli. And worse of all it smelled bad in the dining area . The owner takes no pride in his or her restaurant, sorry if this is your livelihood but this girl is never com"}
{"text":"What a place!  Huge selection from sushi rolls (no sashimi), hibachi, shrimp, roast pork, pizza, chicken nuggets, and a huge dessert bar.  This is in addition to the standard Chinese buffet fare. Everything was hot and fresh.  There were quite a few people in there, but this is a very large place, I think it used to be a steakhouse.  Very clean, even the bathrooms. Lunch buffet is $6.99, dinner is $9.99; an outstanding value.  Open until 9:30 during the week.  Hope this place sticks around for awhile, this will be a regular stop for me now."}
{"text":"Great buffet.  Great hibachi.  Great lunch price. Huge selection and great seating.  Was shocked and impressed and quality of food.  Def a family favorite now."}
{"text":"At $6.99 /lunch or $9.99/dinner this buffet cant be beat. Ichiban is more than \"the typical\" Chinese buffet as it offers sushi and a made to order hibachi station. Dare i say it....but the sushi is better than the buffet at RuSans. Also, I was much more impressed with my visit here here than at the $10.00+ more per person trip to Tin Tin. Ichiban is what it is with decent Americanized-Chinese food and other typical American fare one would expect to see on a buffet of this sort. Think beef-broccoli, sesame chicken, pepper steak, eggrolls, stuffed mushrooms, chicken nuggets, fried shrimp etc. There should be something for everyone. The food itself is pretty good considering the price. Sure some items, like the desserts are a bit lacking, but lets be honest here... how many buffets really excel in the dessert area?  Keep in mind that visiting for lunch or an early dinner is probably the best time to go. Once i went close to closing time and there were not as many choices remaining. Which i personally can totally understand as it impacts waste and food costs. Overall, for decent food, huge selection, nice staff and great price i say Ichiban is a worth a shot."}
{"text":"This place just recently opened, and we've already eaten there a few times. It's much better value and quality than most of the other Asian buffet places that we've tried. In addition to the regular buffet, they have sushi and a Mongolian grill all included in the very reasonable buffet price. It's an especially good value at lunch time. Unlike some other places that have come and gone, Ichiban seems to put some effort into making sure that the foods on the buffet are fresh and hot. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Not clean or sanitary ! I went yesterday the first thing I did was go to the restroom because I am eight months pregnant and had to go. What I walked into was so disgusting I posted a video on here if u want to look. All the toilets were a mess . As I'm in there recording the waitress walks on there to fix her hair as if nothing is wrong ! I told the Manger on duty and all he had to say was its the customers fault not once did he try to fix the problem ! Mind u this is a buffet so if the restroom is this disgusting and the people that work here don't care I know the food is experiencing cross contamination ! I am going to report this to the health department PLEASE LOOK AT THE VIDEO . The pee in the toilets looked like they had been there for hours ! The general manger said he doesn't care, that he doesn't have a set schedule to keep the restroom clean , and that its okay for customers to go in there make a mess and then fix there on food ! Do not eat here u can get sick ."}
{"text":"Food is average. Make sure you take all your valuables with you. Their parking lot is known for multiple break-ins a week."}
{"text":"This place is REALLY Cheap and the food is awesome. It is always packed when I go in there so if that would bother you don't go. Definitely becoming a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Given the number of critical reviews, I was very unsure what I was getting into when we decided to give the Ichiban Buffet a try.  Well, either we really lucked out on a Sunday evening or they have improved their act in the past several months.  It was a perfectly satisfactory dining experience.  As noted by others, this is NOT fine dining.  It is an Asian buffet.  But the selection was large, the food was reasonably fresh, and we got good attention from our server, who frequently refilled my ice tea.  The sushi selection was a bit limited, but it was fresh.  The offering for the hibachi grill were also fresh and the fry chef knew his business.  There was a wide range of fresh, fried and baked offerings for the buffet, including shrimp and frogs legs!  It would not be mistaken for 'health food', but it is definitely value for your money."}
{"text":"Best fried shrimp and blue crab I have ever tasted!!!!!!!! I feel like I work hard everyday so that I can support my family, pay bills and eat here on the weekends... GOOD JOB, AND GOOD FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food. Outstanding selection. Hibachi. Sushi. Friendly service. Crowded. Inexpensive."}
{"text":"Not horrible, not great. There were decent things on the tables and some things were just too gross to eat.  I went here because I was stuck on a long layover and needed to crash at the hotel next door. Without a car, this was the only decent place I could get to .  I tried the fish and the salad bar..I then tried the sautéed fish - it was very tasty - although not particularly fresh. I would go here again if I was in the same boat - desperate with no where else to go."}
{"text":"Good food and not too pricey! Love their deep fried crabs and clams are good. Perfect for a cheap night out. Only downfall is it takes them a long time to keep the buffet filled especially the oysters always have to ask for them. Sometimes they don't show up on the buffet until an hour later AFTER I had asked for it..."}
{"text":"It's difficult for me to give out 5 stars, but if my kids said this is a 2000 stars place. As I am married to a woman from china, I eat plenty of authentic Chinese food at home and in and around Atlanta.  Ichiban buffet is your basic Americanized Chinese style buffet.  Ichiban had a very impressive selection with plenty of choices to make, a grill hibachi and sushi. We were plenty full on all this tastefully prepared dishes. It is one of the better places I've been, we even went back the day we life for some food by the pound.     Contact them at 704-393-7833 visit them 3302 QUEENS CITY DRIVE"}
{"text":"The food was middle of the road. Some things were overcooked and limp with grease, others that are my favorites at other similar places were not to my taste. The lo mein wasn't bad and the roast beef really good. The deserts were tasty. The service was friendly and quick with refills. With that said, the last refill, the server took my glass and when he brought it back, the water tasted a little soapy -- like it was a signal to pay my bill and leave. I may give it a second try."}
{"text":"OMG what a surprise.  So, a few years ago this location was a prime buffet so it will let you know that I do not get over to this side of the interstate often, especially when I realized that this was now Ichiban's Buffet Restaurant (has been for more than two years).  At first, the signage and outside appearance kept me questioning my ability to want to eat here, so I looked to my fellow Yelper's for recent reviews, and this helped ease my fear of the unknown. It was a solid 4 Stars.  When I saw a few blue collar workers coming out of the restaurant, I knew I was in for a treat, and for just $6.99 for a lunch buffet, I was ready to take an adventure.  It was very clean on the inside, and I was very surprised by the sheer number of buffet tables which were completely full with fresh food.  The food ranged from sushi, pork, lasagna, salmon, to chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken and more chicken. I felt I was in a Forest Gump movie with every known possible variety of chicken, and yes, they even offered shrimp, stuffed shrimp, peeled shrimp, firecracker shrimp, grilled shrimp, garlic shrimp.....I think you get the point.  So, I don't have much time for lunch, but between the fast service, the number of tables and the fresh food, I will definitely make an effort to enjoy this buffet more often for lunch.  They do offer take out .....you pay by the pound.  I have added a picture for your enjoyment."}
{"text":"For you hardcore/casual Japanese food fanatics, don't let the name of this restaurant fool you!  There isn't anything remotely Japanese about this restaurant besides the substandard sushi choices.  I've been to Japanese buffet restaurants with the similar mix of Japanese/Chinese food and believe me, there are good ones out there! But not this one... I came here with my family waiting for our flight out of Charlotte and I more or less enjoyed the Yuengling more than anything here.  The majority of my time here I was having a hard time discerning what I would be choosing to consume during my time here... I more or less felt more sorry for me 4 year old brother who didn't have a choice really in what he was being fed here; poor guy.  If you could care less, fancy yourself in some low-quality buffet, this is the place for you.  I personally would choose Golden Corral instead of this place any day."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch during our layover in Charlotte. Food is cheap and plentiful, nothing fancy but it def got a lot of selections. Shrimp, steak, mussels, chicken, pizza, all kinds of Americanized Chinese food you name it. They also have steamed whole fish which was a plus. Mongolian grill is also up and sizzling and they cook a la carte in front of you. Many constructions workers eat here for lunch. I would recommend this place if you are hungry and are in a rush."}
{"text":"i had a positive experience at Ichiban Buffet. i flew into Charlotte hungry, and this little gem popped up on yelp. it's a 5 minute drive away, so already hard not to like. i was seated and served my drink quickly. my sever was friendly and smiling.  many reviews between yelp and foursquare pointed me towards the sushi. that was indeed a good move! after a full plate, i sat for a few minutes then went into the land of chinese food. there are many traditional and non-traditional options to choose from. sure, some things are greasy or fat-laden, but there are plenty of healthier options too. you can figure out which is which - it's not rocket science.  for the price, Ichiban is a fantastic deal. i recommend it very much, especially if you go with people with disparate tastes. everyone will walk away with a happy and full belly!"}
{"text":"If only Yelp had negative ratings..but unfortunately, the lowest I can give is 1 star. Everything about this place is just horrible! From the sushi to the hot items to the desserts...  Let's start with the sushi. Now, my family is in the sushi business so I know my sushi. Whoever said that Ichiban's sushi is fresh and the best in the area obviously never had decent quality sushi. I can't even say it was decent here...it was probably the worst sushi I've ever had. The sushi rice was hard. The fish was fishy...not the least bit fresh at all.   The hot items were so bland that salt couldn't even make it edible. The general tso's chicken, sesame chicken, fried chicken, broccoli stir fry, green beans....my God! How do you mess this up? Everything was flavorless...either overcooked, too chewy, too dry, or ridiculously bland. Just horrible.  Now onto desserts..how coyld they mess this up right? I mean, after all, they didn't make it. But boy was I wrong. Only Ichiban could manage to screw up dessert. The cakes were so dry that I had to spit it out...couldn't make myself swallow it. Everything this restaurant serves is inedible.   With this being Charlotte, I guess you can't really expect much. There are much better restaurants in the area so I highly advise you to keep on driving. Ichiban was made to disappoint."}
{"text":"I would go anywhere other than here. The decor is less than appealing and the food goes right along with it. Went for lunch and waited 15 mins for the hibachi cook to lollygag in sipping a drink as he cooked our food. He ended up overcooking it so much that the veggies I chose were all mush and ultimately inedible.   The buffet is mediocre as well and not as many choices as other places I've been to for a cheaper price. Service was okay. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The one star goes to the service, it was average.The food was not goOD at all everything was almost inedible.Most of it was cold and sitting there for a while NOT GOOD WE LEFT AFTER QUICKLY EATING"}
{"text":"I actually don't understand why this place received an average score. It has fresh sushi, it has a hibachi grill, the buffet items were fresh, the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Understanding what you are getting into is important to the review process - this isn't fine dining, and it isn't even fine food. It's a food fest, and on that front, they do what they do and do it fairly well.  There are a number of buffet lines, and each gives you a decent number of selections. You even have hibachi and sushi options. Being close to the airport could help, if you are on your way from, or on your way to a flight.  The only problem is that the service - yes, service, at a buffet - isn't that great. As an example, you can usually drop your hibachi selections for cooking, pick up anything else and then come back to find your food cooked and waiting for you. Here, the hibachi station is tiny, as in they can only cook two or so dishes at a time. That means it takes forever for them to process an enormous line, and by the time you finally get your food, your other food is already cold and the rest of your party is done eating. Not just their first plate, but likely the second, third, fourth, etc. If they fixed this, it could be better. Or just don't eat the hibachi."}
{"text":"During a recent overnight stay at a nearby hotel, we decided to walk over to the Ichiban for dinner.  The bored looking hostess gave is a flat greeting before showing us to our seats.    There are numerous hot buffet bars with dozens of entrees, appetizets, soups, desserts to choose from.  Unfortunatley, this is a prime example of how quality suffers when a place specializes in churning out volumes of dishes (a lot of which were barely warm, I might add.)  Although I am not a big Waffle House fan, in hindsight I should have gone there instead as it was just across the street!"}
{"text":"Good grief, why does anyone go here? A bunch of \"mystery meats\" plus dried out overcooked fried mystery veggies.  Don't go here, you're better off eating at McDonalds"}
{"text":"straight delicious, hit the spot after a 6 hour drive, there was so many options. not bad for getting in late and not having many options on a Thursday night"}
{"text":"I was really craving Chinese buffet and found this place on Yelp. Reviews looked okay...walked in and the place is pretty dinky. The seats were worn out and it just felt dirty. There was plenty of seating which was nice. All the food was just so...Blech. The chicken dishes were too starchy and the sauce tasted weird. Even the fried rice was overly greasy. The clams were chewy and the sushi looked gray. To be honest nothing was good although the hot and sour soup was decent. Prices were cheap - about $12 per person - but I'd rather pay a few more bucks and get a better buffet."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. Terrible food, extremely dirty. Asked for a new fork because paper was stuck to my fork. Waitress went through four forks before finding one that didn't have food or crap stuck to it. Floors are greasy and dirty. Waiter sweeps like he's trying to rip up the carpet right next to people who are eating. I have been to some better restaurants in third world countries."}
{"text":"Returning to Ichiban after a while and it's safe to say that it hasn't changed very much at all. The physical layout is the same, most of the items on the steam table are about the same and the prices are about the same as they were when I last reviewed them in 2011.  It's always busy in here, but I think that may be more of the quantity than quality folks. Lots of plates piled up deep as if they don't know that they can return again and again.  It is decent. And I'm fine with an A-OK review because I'm not really a fan. I think that there are better. But it is absolutely A-OK."}
{"text":"I enjoy dining at Ichiban.  Since we were in a hurry on this evening, we ordered spring rolls and vegetable fried rice (quick fixin's).  We also ordered two glasses of wine, a Merlot and a Pinot Noir, neither were fabulous.  The spring rolls, however, arrived smoking hot and delicious.  The rice arrived shortly thereafter and was pretty tasty.  Overall, service was quick, the food was great, and we were able to fill up before the show, in short order!"}
{"text":"i didnt even get to try half the stuff on this buffet and at lunch for $6.99 this is a steal...great sushi, great americanized chinese food, didnt get to try the hibachi but will next time, the desserts, salads and many many other american foods are on this buffet. well worth the money!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this buffet for a work lunch. Not only do they have asain food but they have a variety of american food also. Wanna eat healthy? I do not think a buffet is your place. You will get your monies worth here and I have never had a problem with my drink needing to be refilled. They take good care of you here. Happy over eating!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife where picking up my mom at the airport, we were all hungry, didn't want to drive far and didn't want to eat burgers and fries.  This place is right down the road from the airport.  The restaurant is big, the staff is friendly (even if their English is pretty bad), there is a huge selection of food, probably the most I've seen in a Chinese buffet.  The place is not the prettiest but it is clean.  The sushi was fine, not great, not bad, just like most buffet places.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this restaurant because when we walked in the place was almost packed except for a few tables. I was shocked by the large number of buffet items at this restaurant. We were quickly seated drink orders placed and at the buffet in no time after arriving. The good: Great customer service.  The bad: This food should be marketed as low calorie. it only stayed in my stomach for about 5 minutes before making a photo-finish exit! The floor in both the restrooms and the buffet had standing water. Not like someone just moped, puddles! Restrooms where nasty btw. My roommate got a piece of raw chicken!  Minor complaints: shrimp where not devained, nothing beyond your standard Chinese buffet in regards to food variety. The sushi was chewy, not sure how that's even possible?   It sucks that I had to give this place a lower rating because the staff is so pleasant. My drink never ran dry and my finished plates where quickly removed."}
