{"text":"This is one of those \"one bad experience\" reviews. 

I'm not sure what was happening there the day I stopped in, but things were not going well. There was one inexperienced young girl running the entire place. To her credit, she was doing the best she could, but despite there being just one other table of people, she couldn't handle it. I knew we were in trouble when the other table mentioned that they had been waiting for their food for 45 minutes.

The details aren't really necessary, so I'll summarize: the food was okay. Not great. And it took far too long to arrive. They didn't have what we ordered, and didn't know that until most of the other food was ready, but the poor girl did what she could, and refunded me the my money for what she couldn't.

Others may have had a better time there, but I won't be back.

Oh, and the beans were weird. I swear there was nutmeg and pineapple in there."}
{"text":"Tried this place as a friend  had good things to say about the staff and the food. I looked at their menu and ordered just about everything...true story. Can you say um um good?"}
{"text":"Awful. Microwaved. Throwing in the trash. The cornbread was not fresh, it was cold and hard. We got a hot link that was probably microwaved as well since it looked all shriveled up.  With Dillons and Rudys close by, why settle for such substandard food?"}
{"text":"The food had a good taste. Yelp has it rated with one $. It would have been a good price if the portions were larger. Just 3 ribs that were mostly bone, a couple of spoonfuls of beans and a big dose of slaw. Not the best meal in the area."}
{"text":"Everybody's Neighborhood Grill has your soul food favorite's along with a nice compliment of other items if soul food isn't your thing.  

The smothered pork chops were awesome and don't miss the GREENS and mac & cheese!  Had to capitalize the greens, they were so good.  

I'm glad the Neighborhood Grill is only a few blocks down from my office!  Keep of the good work!"}
{"text":"Walked in around 2pm on Friday and waited at the front counter for roughly 5 mins without ever seeing any of the employees.  Left and went next door to the Thai place, good food there."}
{"text":"Very nice and homey feel to this place. The venue is clean and the food was good. I had jerk chicken, rice, and greens. I'm not the biggest fan of eating other people's greens, but these were bangin.' I was very pleased. Also, the prices are good for the amount of food and the flavor. My friend and I watched Living Single and A Different World,  which just was the icing on the cake;)"}
{"text":"First of all we were not greeted! Customer service was awful they didn't seem very familiar with their own menu! Once we ordered we waited for 45 minutes only to get home and see greasy fries old fried chicken horrible mac and cheese terribly old red velvet cake! No lids for our take home drinks the coke was horrible!! $32.00 wasted would never ever go back!!"}
{"text":"I pass by this place everyday. Decided last week to give it shot. It was close to 7pm. First bad sign, as I walked in another woman was leaving, empty handed and looked angry. I walked in and nobody was out front. I waited a few minutes. I could see a man who was on the phone. By the sounds of it, it was a personal call. I could also see a young woman sitting all the way in back sitting on either a counter or a cooler. I kept saying \"hello\" louder and louder. Every once in a while, the young woman would peak her head out and look at me and then nothing. Another woman entered looking to order food. She waited and started yelling hello. I know they heard us. We waited probably a good 10-15 minutes just to see if they would acknowledge is....nothing. Well, won't be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome pulled pork, catfish, mac n cheese and hushpuppies. They also do greens the first Sat of the month. Its a small place for dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Waited an awfully long time for our food which had great flavor but it was lukewarm. Awesome cornbread though."}
{"text":"We have never ate there but ordered food to go because it's right down the road from us. The food is AMAZING and the price is right. We ordered pulled pork sandwiches and fries and for my son the kids meal fish. Our sandwiches were so yummy and the fries cooked correctly and seasoned well. My sons fish was to die for and fish is usually not my thing esp fresh water fish. The kids meals are only $3.99 and it was more than enough fries and fish plus it comes with a Capri Sun and fruit snacks so he loved that. We will for sure be ordering again from here and I'm glad to have it so close to the house."}
{"text":"Ok they did open late on Sunday, I was in mood for some ribs and it hit the spot. Couple of young guys there very nice and eager to serve the customer."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich & fries were amazing! 
Prices were great, comfortable environment and surprised on how much food I got for the price"}
{"text":"This is some great bbq best prices in town.  You can't beat it!  I had the rib dinner great mac & cheese, but I don't know about jalapeños peppers in my hush puppies. Will visit again."}
{"text":"The food might have been good but I will never know due to the fact that it is no longer in business."}
{"text":"The ribs fell off the bone they were so tender and juicy. I almost ordered wings but the manager said that everyone comes for the ribs. Glad I got them. Service is super friendly,  the manager put cartoons  on the TV for my toddler and was really attentive. If I'm on this side of town again I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place the other night and we were not impressed. I really want to like this place because I want some good BBQ so we might go back and try again. Service was ok, but very slow. We got brisket sandwiches with fries. The brisket wasn't very tender. Will go back to try the ribs and mac n cheese and hopefully find it to be a little better."}
{"text":"Never been here before, so we gave this place a try because it was a walking distant from home. Walked into here and it's a cute little restaurant. It wasn't busy at all, thank goodness! There menu is very simple & easy to read. Decided I might as well try there wings. So got an order of 12 wings. Flavors were Asian zing & lemon pepper. Total came out to $10 something. The man who took our order was nice & welcoming. Gave my son a treat, cool points for you. Anyways when we got home. I decided to eat my wings with rice. My favorite was lemon pepper. OMGAD YUMMMMMMY! Asian zing wasn't bad at all, different style of taste compare to bww. I definitely will go back to try the other food out. Overall, good experience!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a bite to eat.


Everybody's Neighborhood Grill is small and unassuming.  You place your order at the front counter, take a seat, and wait for your entrée to arrive.  

The staff at Everybody's Neighborhood Grill are friendly, accomdating, and the prices are reasonable. On this visit my lunch companion and I had the Beef Brisket & Hot link platter, Macaroni and Cheese, potato salad and corn bread.

The Beef Brisket was tender, moist, and absolutely delicious as was the Macaroni & Cheese and Corn Bread. I wasn't a fan of the potato salad and the hot link was flavorful but to hot for me. However, my lunch companion said it was one of the best he has ever had.

I enjoy supporting local business and plan on going back to Everybody's Neighborhood Grill soon to try the ribs. If  you're looking for tasty, affordable BBQ stop by Everybody's Neighborhood Grill you won't be disappointed.  However be prepared to wait it took 30 to 40 minutes for our entrée to arrive. Service although good seems to be on the slow side."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place and finally decided to stop in. I ordered a rib dinner and a catfish dinner to sample and share with my two sons. Both my picky 6 and 10 year old gobbled up their food and asked for more. This place is a breath of fresh air! Their portions are good and the prices are very reasonable. Did i mention the food was delicious? They have a great selection on their menu not just bbq. Tilapia and catfish, hot links, chicken wings with different flavors, and jerk chicken. I will definitely be coming back and spreading the word. Please give them a try. It would be a shame for such a nice place to go unnoticed."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to get a home cooked meal away from home. All the food is freshly prepared with only the best ingredients. The wait is just a little longer than your average restaurant but good things are worth the wait! The staff is friendly and the prices can't be beat. Like the name says it's everybody's neighborhood grill!"}
{"text":"We just finished a good meal. The place was staffed by two brothers who were very friendly. I had the pulled pork plate with coleslaw and potato salad and hubby had ribs with collard greens and chili beans. We both opted for cornbread.

I enjoyed the pulled pork. The sauce was spicy sweet and the coleslaw was a good compliment. Hubby enjoyed his ribs, which were prepared southern style. The cornbread was delicious.

Before we went in I read the previous reviews. I asked the owner if they had been closed and they had been for a week for a trip so ignore the erroneous post from the end of August. The ribs are southern style which means they are not fall off the bone style ribs. Traditional southern style ribs have a slight pull from the bone as these do. Southern style cornbread is served in a square like a piece of cake unlike corn cakes which are in pancake form. It's confusing but it is tradition.

We lived in the south for 20 years and have had Carolina, Memphis and Kansas City barbecue along with several other styles along the way. This barbecue is southern and the sides are soul food style. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We found Everybody's Neighborhood Grill after a Google search for bbq near Avondale.  
The decor is the love child of a man cave and Mom's kitchen so a little confused but very comfortable.  We ordered the brisket dinner, pulled pork dinner, and a cheeseburger kids meal.  The burger in the kids meal was a full sized burger so there was a lot left over, no complaints about the pulled pork and the brisket was so tender you could cut it with a spoon.  My mouth is watering again thinking about it, it was so yummy!  Being from TN and being spoiled by Memphis BBQ I am often disappointed by the slim offerings I have found in AZ but Everybody's did NOT disappoint. 
Thank you for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Really good food..will def come through next time I'm back in AZ

Had the catfish , mac n cheese and beans . Cornbread was off the hook. It's hard to find some good food that reminds me of the east coast ."}
{"text":"Food is ridiculously authentic and delicious!!! Staff is even better.  Love the ribs & mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"E.N.G took over for the Jamaian place that was here. They serve what the hood likes. 

SOUL FOOD 
BBQ
MEXICAN
AMERICAN

\"EVERYBODY\" will find something to eat here. 

The place is clean and orderly with nothing changed from the previous owners except the menu. 

I had the brisket sandwhich and it was good. Served with a side of Tater salad. The brisket was a shredded type with a sweet sauce on a sesame studded bun. There was plenty of meat and plenty of tater salad. The salad was good, nice flavor and ingredients. 

The prices seem fair for what you get. I would def go back! (As long as they are open next time I come down that way)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my hubby, its actually in our neighborhood :-) Waited at the counter for a couple of minutes and no one was there, so we left and went next door for Thai, Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for over a year - this place has great food, quick simple, reasonably priced.  Easy to find, and extremely friendly staff - they're great.

When I want BBQ and don't want to make it myself, I don't even think twice - this is where I go.  

This place is very worth the visit.  Try them out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was okay almost tasted like leftovers. I had read the reviews on this place and expected delicious BBQ, however much to my dismay the brisket was dry. The Mac and cheese was okay but nothing spectacular, and the fries we received were warm like they had been sitting out. The food was good but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I got the pulled pork with sides of cole slaw, mac & cheese and cornbread. 

The pork was amazing, and the portion was huge! (I gave about 1/3 to my husband and still felt like I had a nice portion.) The sauce was just right - not too sweet, not too strong. 

The mac & cheese was excellent and not dry like many restaurants'. I would have liked a bit more, and would have sacrificed a little bit of pork for it (albeit reluctantly - the pork was so good!). The cole slaw was just ok, but as a side for pulled pork it served its purpose and didn't detract from the meal. The cornbread was perfectly moist without being heavy.

I also ordered one piece of catfish as a test. I love catfish, but am VERY picky. This was great, and very clean-tasting with a nice, light breading.

My husband ordered the pepper jack burger and french fries. He liked the fries, and felt the burger was ok. He's definitely planning to order the pulled pork next time. ;)

The staff was all fabulous - really friendly and attentive. The food took a bit long to arrive, but it was definitely worth the wait and I'm ok with it, given the casual feel of the place.

There's only one reason I gave four stars instead of five: they use a lot of styrofoam. I know that's picky, but styrofoam is SO bad for the environment, and it feels a  wasteful to use it for eat-in service. Something as simple as using a more environmentally friendly box, plus a recycling option for disposal, would have made this 5/5 for me!"}
{"text":"It took us forever to find good southern food after our last place closed. So glad we found this it's hard to get this great taste in Far West PHX. GREAT customer service!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend.  Got a hamburger and a pulled pork sandwich. Pork was cut chunks with BBQ sauce dumped on top. Bun fell apart when trying to pick it up.  Hamburger tastes like a frozen meat bi-product with no frills.   Menu was not BBQ type foods and nothing really seemed edible.   Halfway through our food my son found hair in his fries and under his burger.   Not impressed and didn't even want to give it a star... Star basically is because they are cheap but its definitely you get what you pay for. Cheap, tasteless, and unimpressive."}
{"text":"I really hope to see these guys make it.. I went by one day too early and one of the guys came out to say hello and let me know when they would open that day. We finally made it down there last night to give them a try... kinda weird to walk into a BBQ place and not smell the BBQ! There were a few families in there, everyone was waiting for food. We gave our order to the 12 or 13 year old behind the counter and she placed it to her side and we sat down to watch her spend the next 10 minutes continuing to take orders... (Our slip was still on the counter..) Finally the entire stack of slips was sent to the back, we joked with the table next to us that we were probably on the bottom... After quite a wait the last family that walked in got their order and left... then the couple that came in behind us got their order as we sat and waited... by now we had gotten to know them a little and they were from Kansas City...  In their words the BBQ was ok... he felt that the meat should pull from the bone, which it defiantly did not do. They completed their meal and offered us some untouched ribs while we were STILL waiting for our food! We declined and finally the food comes out. Hubby takes the cornbread and immediately pushes it to the side of the table.. he refused to try it even, \"Its cake, not bread!\" The ribs were ok... we pretty much thought the same, that it should pull from the bone more. The coleslaw was nothing spectacular and the rice/beans were pretty much left untouched. Not a place that we would go out of our way to go to by any means... :o("}
{"text":"Stopped in as we live a few minutes away, and have always wanted to try it.   I ordered the beef brisket, my girl ordered the ribs. 

Beef brisket was to die for, I wish I had two orders! Sauce is a little tangy, I like it like that. 

Ribs looked very appetizing but my date wasn't impressed. She is used to my ribs, so this place had the deck stacked against it as my ribs are the business.  But I also don't cook for the public and takes all day to perfect. 

I tasted the ribs and they had the same sauce the brisket had, but the meat did not slide off the bone like it should. Yum love their sauce though. 

Corn bread is very tasty!   I also had a side of Cole slaw, very tasty and it had hunks of mandarins mixed it, nice touch! 

I'm sold on the brisket, I'll get that everyday of the week if my ass wouldn't swell.   Ribs need some work."}
{"text":"Love the Macaroni here. They have spicy jerk which is good. I love the Peach Cobbler. I take it home and eat it with ice cream."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly place. There's a passion for what they do which is hard to find. Had a nice talk with the owners son Kevin. He is a highly motivated person."}
{"text":"Food was great!!! Guys there very cool. Owner came up and gave my son a Kool Aid jammer and some candy. Great ribs and Mac & Cheese. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The guy was so nice but it took forever to get our food. When we made it home we realized the extra hot link we ordered and paid for was not there. It wasn't much food for the orice. My boyfriend was very disappointed in it. I will give it one more chance to see if it was an off day."}
{"text":"Waiting to pick up my dinner order, and am super excited as always. My husband loves the brisket dinner, and you can't go wrong with their pulled pork dinner and side of Mac & Cheese. The staff is always very nice, and I love that we can support a small family owned, local business. Great food, awesome prices and stellar service, we're regulars!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Fine Ash cigars and smelled a wonderful aroma of wood smoked meat.  it was coming from Everybody's Neighborhood Grill.  I went in and ordered some takeout. Got pulled pork, beef brisket, a rib, and fish ala carte. For $2 a serving I thought it would be an easy way to check their food out. The barbecue sauce was a deep molasses brown sugar cinnamon sauce with just a little heat....tasty. Fish was hand breaded in a great cornbread type breading.

The restaurant looks clean though a bit small. Their food is so good they may have to expand at some point."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Atmosphere was comfortable (causal& laid back).  Staff as helpful and friendly.  Prices are good.  We will be back... Often!"}
{"text":"I waited FOR 35 MINUTES tonight just for 2 brisket meals to go. They weren't even hot when I arrived home and I live less than 1 minute away. It was still a fine meal, saved by the amazing cornbread!! But, I have no intention of going back any time soon."}
{"text":"First time eating there today. Pulled pork sandwich was high quality and flavorful. So was potato salad and cole slaw. BBQ sauce was excellent as was the friendly customer service. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Fresh & delish. 1st time visiting this BBQ place, and was on the lookout for a non-chain spot. This family-owned spot hit it. 
I placed a phone pick-up order for a tilapia dinner (mac 'n cheese & fries). 10-15 minutes lster, picked up a nice, fresh and hot dinner. It was still piping hot when I arrived home.
Also ordered a slice a peach cobbler. Delish.
Will return."}
