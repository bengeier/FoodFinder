{"text":"The service -- if it can be called that -- at Bobbie's has been steadily declining for quite some time. My husband and I decided to give the place one more chance. What a mistake. After being shown to a table, we sat there for at least 10 minutes while the wait staff cleared tables, stood by the cash register and talked, checked on the few other patrons who were there and just generally ignored us. We finally got up and walked out and in doing so passed by a group of four employees who were standing near the entrance talking.  None of them even looked at us.  This irritated my husband even more than he already was, so he went back and told them we were walking out and why. One woman responded, \"Were you sitting in there?\" and another said, \"It wasn't my job to wait on you, but I'll take care of you now if you want to sit back down.\"  We declined the offer and told them we would not be back. They obviously could not have cared less."}
{"text":"Have read about this place several times in the paper as one of the better places in the NW Valley to have breakfast, so I finally made the relatively short trek to try it out.  What a disappointment.  Nothing unusual about the menu.  Eggs unremarkable, somewhat cold as judged by all three of us.  Pancakes overly cooked, tasteless, and not at all \"fluffy,\" again a unanimous opinion.  And the potatoes were undercooked slabs of substance that looked microwaved.  Service was rushed, but pleasant.  Coffee good.  But certainly not worth the trip.  Won't return.  Don't understand the repeated good ratings."}
{"text":"This use to be a decent place.  But new ownership took over an it has slowly gone down hill.  I still dealt with the decline up until recently when my niece found a piece of suran wrap in her burger.  When we notified our waitress she came back and said the manager took half off the price of the plate.  HALF OFF!?  Believing this to be unacceptable, I asked to speak to the manager.  After explaining the situation he stated that she still ate half the sandwich and I quote, \"It was only suran wrap that the meat was wrapped in.\"  That is literally what he said.  Needless to say I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Nice people...bad food. We went for breakfast and got some things to share. Bacon, eggs and pancakes were way overcooked. Our 3 year old had biscuits and gravy which was pretty bland, even she dumped salt and ketchup all over it. Definitely did not hit the spot which sucks cause we were really in a b-fast mood and starving."}
{"text":"Pros: The service is fast, food is tasty, and cheap. The salad bar has fresh veggies, several pasta salads and four soups to pick from. My hubby had the Ruben sandwich, he thoroughly enjoyed it. He reports the male bathrooms were clean, I never checked out the ladies.  Con: the dishwasher needs to be fired! The salad plates, mugs and utensils were dirty. The soup spoon utensil bucket at the salad bar had crumbs and food stuck in the bottom. The least they could do was put the handles to the bottom and not where I put my mouth into. Eeewwww!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while looking for a good place for breakfast near Vistancia.  It turned out to be a GREAT breakfast place and SUPER price/performance.  Prices are excellent and portions are sizeable.  Just like an old time diner.  We'll definitely make this our regular weekend breakfast spot.  Looks like they'll be moving a mile south on 99th in about a month."}
{"text":"Great food, breakfast is superb. Family owned restaurant where you are greeted from first minute. Food portion is huge and food is super tasty and the price is amazing. Recommended!"}
{"text":"It's hard to ruin breakfast, but they have succeeded.  We ordered two separate items -- me: scrambled eggs, crispy bacon and fruit in stead of hash browns.  My husband: a ham & cheese omelet, fruit instead of hash browns.  Both of us ordered toast.  Sadly the best part of the meal was the toast.  Husband didn't get the fruit but it was canned and looked awful so he didn't complain.  I didn't eat it.  Our eggs were rubbery leading me to think they are using liquid eggs.  My husband said the ham was too salty to eat. My crispy bacon disintegrated in my mouth. This restaurant changed hands a short while ago and it's pretty clear they've made the decision to use prepared foods rather than fresh.  In fact, my husband noted on the menu that that word \"fresh\" next to the selection of \"fruit\" had been whited out. The staff was pleasant and attentive, but it took so long to get our bill, that we went to the counter and were politely scolded being told we needed to wait until we paid at the table.  Won't be back unless new information comes to light.  Sad.  Used to be pretty good."}
{"text":"This breakfast was incredible. I love the way they make their omelettes, they don't just fold and stuff them, they mix the eggs with the ingredients. And their potatoes were delicious! Scalloped style. I'm so glad I stopped in. I will be back. And you can't beat the prices! Not a single complaint. My server Suzi was attentive and on point and super sweet. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"My husband and I saw that this place had a salad bar, so we decided to try it out. Once we we seated our waiter came and took our drink order, and brought them to us. We sat there for about 5 mins while he was cleaning two other tables, the place was not busy and we had our menus closed just waiting for him to take our order.. Very annoying.  Finally I asked the hostess as she walked by who our waiter was we were ready to order. It was the same guy who took our drink order and taking his time cleaning tables instead of taking care of his customers. He took our orders and I asked for the check and boxes right away as I could tell he would be slow. He told us we could not get boxes cause we got the salad bar, I clarified that we were not using the boxes for the salad, he said those were the rules. Our food came quickly and it was all good, though he never asked. When we were finishing eating he asked if we could please hurry and sign so he could go home. We will never go back. Unfourtunatley the service is always awful in the sun city area."}
{"text":"They moved and are now at 99th & Greenway (I think it's Greenway--it's the same center where Dollar General is and they are next to Dollar General).  They are in what used to be a dinner/night club place.    I love their food; yes, it's average good, but you know what it is and they had Creamed Chipped Beef on Toast yesterday.  For me, that's a wow.  And they are always glad to substitute fruit for fries.  I always go there when I'm in Sun City.  People there work very, very hard.  A+= for me."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful diner to get those comfort foods you want all tasting homemade. I had the Monte Cristo sandwich which was wonderful and not greasy. French fries were to die for!!! Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I am looking forward to going back next time in town to check out breakfast. Their menu is very diverse for every  type of person kids included. I will definitely go there again. Prices were great and affordable."}
{"text":"We've been to Bobbie's 2 times in this past week. The 1st visit was on  Sunday morning after church. The place was packed and we waited only about 10 minutes. We all ordered breakfast and it was great!! I had the Greek omelet and it was really tasty. Service was fast and friendly.  We came back for lunch later in the week and again it was terrific. Some ordered breakfast, others sandwiches and everyone was very satisfied. Again, the service was fast and friendly. We definitely will be back again!!"}
{"text":"This is great restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food is extremely good and everyone is extremely nice and helpful. I definitely recommend coming here to eat. I loved the food and working atmosphere here!"}
{"text":"I take my Mother out to lunch in Sun City often. Mercers has always been our 1st choice. One gets tired of the same all the time. So we ventured to Bobbies. Have been there now a dozen times, each time hoping to find a better experience. We are usually greeted by no one , and I mean all we get is the question \"two?'\" No hello, how are you, etc. We are lead to the table menus plopped down. Then waiter, or waitress comes , and we literally had one that just came and said, \"drink\" that was it, again no hello, nothing. We are regulars at Mercers and really wanted to be at Bobbies, but no one remembers you and the sevice is awful. The waitstaff really act like they could care less about you. I have to say that Mario the owner has recognized us once or twice but that was it. When you go to a diner you don't expect aaa rated food, but i do expect good service. They really need to go to Mercers and see how the staff there treats customers, that come back . We are done at Bobbies."}
{"text":"Service was so-so. Our server was very much in her own little world it seemed. The restaurant was clean and good came out fast but it wasn't anything to write home about. Standard cafe fare, maybe a little freshness would liven it up."}
{"text":"meh.....but what do you expect in a retirement city. Try little bit of italy, far better."}
{"text":"Today I went to Bobbies only to hear something from the staff that has really changed my whole opinion of this place and the way it is run.   Never again....."}
{"text":"The food here was very very good the service was excellent walked in sat down at a table the portions are absolutely huge one of the best cafes I've ever been to I would recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"My flavor place for breakfast on Sundays.  Also had lunch a few times n services n food was excellent with the price.  Always called in early if we 6 or more in our group.  Try their biscuits n gravy outstanding with the price."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite little senior spots for some good food, reasonable prices and staff that treats you very nicely. Their manager is always walking the floor and making sure the patrons are being attended to and happy with the service. Their breakfast veggie omelet is a favorite of mine with fresh spinach and cheese on top with country potatoes on the side. I recommend stopping by later in the day (serve breakfast all day) because Sal works that schedule and he really puts his heart into cooking a wonder dish. I had to take a picture yesterday when I was there because it was just so fresh and prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"We ate here on Tuesday 03/06/2012. The service was poor the food was okay but I have to say they really made me mad. My wife ordered the chicken parmesan with the sald bar. Then found out that what you don't eat you can NOT have a to go box. I can under stand them not letting you take your sald home but you can't take you left over chicken parmesan??? That's just crazy I would understand it was a all you can eat but it's not. I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Prices have increased severely.  Service has decreased.  Food not as high quality as I was used to.  I still like this restaurant, but they do need to improve to their former standards.."}
{"text":"This is a budget American Style cafe. I know what kind of food to expect and I certainly wasn't expecting Michelin Quality Cuisine.   I ordered the trout because the menu said it was fresh. I received mixed vegetables that were over boiled and soggy. Fish that was edible but over cooked, dry and seemed more like from frozen and not good. I also received GREY-GREEN mashed potatoes. Right away I asked the server why the potatoes were green. After asking the cook she said potatoes turn green from black pepper and potato skin.   This food was mostly inedible.   The server removed my plate with most of it remaining and didn't say a thing."}
{"text":"The Mr. and I stopped by for breakfast after craving some good ol' diner pancakes and eggs. We each had the Bobbie's Breakfast Special - $3.99 for 2 eggs, golden home fries and 2 slices of bacon. The food was pretty good, but the service wasn't the best. The waitress was attentive - if not overly attentive! Everytime she kept coming back to check on us she would stop and stare at us watching us eat for I swear what felt like a whole minute - not saying anything, just staring! My husband ordered a side of pancakes to go with his breakfast special and she made a comment about how much food we ordered. Who wants to go out to eat and be judged by how much food you order? Please just do your job, take our order, bring our meal and refill our coffee. No need to judge or stare! But where else can you get a full breakfast for under $5 though? Will definitely be back if we're on this side of town...as long as we don't get the judgemental waitress with the staring problem!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while! Finally had the opportunity this past week end, we actually went there twice in the same day! Wife and I ate here after Church for breakfast. We had eggs, home potatoes, bacon, pancakes, and a small order of biscuit and gravy. Food was great, biscuit and gravy was one of the best we have had! Gravy had a very good and unique taste? Kind of tasted like chicken sausage gravy? We cleaned our plates and brought home the daughter a cheese burger. That  same night we came back for dinner, wife and I really like the way, the burgers looked. So I had their bacon burger deluxe. Burger was very good, their 1000 island dressing was also better than usual! Over all we had a great time, family loved their burgers and we will start coming back more often."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. The portions were way bigger than expected too. The service was perfect and the restaurant looks very clean. We were seated quick, got our food quick, check came as soon as we asked. I don't live real close but the drive is worth it!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant for breakfast, but the food takes forever to get to you. The service could be improved. Overall, a very good restaurant and I would recommend it for a great breakfast cafe."}
{"text":"What a find for a good old American Breakfast!  Right at Bell and 99th Ave. We went for breakfast, but their lunch/dinner menu looks pretty good too - the place ought to be featured in Diners, Driveins and Dives - tho this is certainly not a dive.  I had country fried steak (made with certified Angus Beef) with sausage gravy, two eggs, fresh fruit (or hash browns) and toast for $7.99.  Jo-Ann was more conservative - two eggs. toast and hashed browns for $3.99 ($1 more on the weekend, I think).  The food was excellent.  Nothing fancy, just good food with decent serving size at a great price.  Some lunch/dinner choices - 1/3 lb Angus Beef cheeseburger for $5.49, Chicken Cordon Bleu with sides for $8.99, Fish & Chips for $7.49.  I'm ready to go back!  And don't let the \"Sun City\" stop you - this morning the ages were all over the place from teens to seniors."}
{"text":"Restaurant moved location about two years ago, and the menu was changed a bit.  Still a diner atmosphere, and on our recent visits the food was only fair.  Service was very slow and they may have been understaffed.  It's OK as far as restaurants go, but there are several nearby that we prefer.  Meals are not too pricy, but the food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Was greeted and seated very quickly upon entering the place, that was it.  Only wanted water and salad bar for the two of us.  Never saw the waitress again.  Waited 8 minutes for her to take our order, and the place was not busy at all.  So we left.  First time in the place and won't return.  Went down the strip mall to Bit of Italy for lunch."}
{"text":"CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. You have to rate a place within its price bracket. For the price, the food was average good. And this was the cheapest full breakfast we have every had in the United States, and that says a lot.   We had been to a another breakfast spot and found a 30 minute wait and called around to find another with less of a wait. We were on a tighter schedule than expected to get to the ball game in Surprise. We always forget how long it really takes to get out there. North Scottsdale to Surprise Stadium = 50 minutes to an hour with no traffic. Then add traffic. Yikes. Anyway, when we called this place, which would conveniently be on the way to the ballpark, they said no wait. All right, done.   So we ventured on over and found parking easy. We went in and waited about 4 minutes until a booth opened up for us. First impression was not fabulous. The hostess (likely owner) was pretty dry and all the wait staff got into a big discussion at the front about what tables were going to be covered by whom. Ok, do that somewhere else.   Once seated, we ordered coffee (well needed at this point) and tooka look at the menu. We were astonished at the prices on the menu. This was more like the 70's menu. The items would all likely be about the same and the prices were that cheap. A Belgian waffle (which they did not serve the day we were there) was $3.99, pancakes and eggs $5.49, huge omelette with raisin bread $6.99 served with potatoes, bottomless coffee in a thermos on your table $1.50. Needless to say, our breakfast bill was like $15 (including tax) and we both had coffee and struggled to finish our breakfasts. We can rarely get out the door without paying about $25 -$30 with tax and tip.   The food, was in very big quantities. That is a plus to the senior citizens, but is a little less important to me. I feel quality outshines quantity any day. The food was all just ok. Nothing special. Nothing to write home about. Everything was cooked appropriately and all, but I just was not wowed. The pancakes tasted much like bisquick and I am spoiled that I make my own from scratch and tend to expect that of restaurants. SG liked his ham and cheese omelette. The meat and cheese were generous and the omelette huge, as previously mentioned. I was not impressed... but I am not a ham and cheese fan personally.   So, if you are in the area, are happy with a good (not great) breakfast in big quantity and cheap, I highly recommend this place. If you are a foodie, especially a breakfast foodie, check out another spot. If we had had more time, we would have. Now, this really seems to be the only breakfast place out near Surprise Stadium, so that is something to consider too. We may be back if we are tight on time and headed out that direction."}
{"text":"Eww! Food was bland and tasteless and the service was slower than molasses on a cold winter's day. Took us nearly an hour to get our food only to be disappointed. I don't see the hype here. This place sucks. Don't eat here! Unless of course you don't have taste buds then you won't care."}
{"text":"Such a quit place. We were greeted immediately and our food came out quick and hot. The price point is not bad for those on a budget or fixed income (joint is located in Sun City) and the atmosphere is homey. Breakfast is what we had this morning, the short stack is huge is circumference and my steak and eggs were on point. Reminds me of eating breakfast at grand moms house."}
{"text":"Evan was our waiter and he was very attentive and the food was great.  The Spanish omelette was delicious and my husband enjoyed the cakes and eggs and meat.  The cafe has a great \"old\" vibe, the food was good and Evan was awesome.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We've only been here a couple times, but we have had good food & service each time.  This, to me, has been a 4-Star Sun City cafe. The food was served fast & hot. Serving portions were quite ample. I hade the turkey bacon melt ($7.49) and my lovely bride had the California Croissant sandwich ($8.29). Both were very tasty and the croissant was really big enough to share.  Out server, Pat, was attentive, fast & friendly.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I had a delicious french toast that had a tasty crunchy topping (maybe rice krispies) topped with bananas. The staff was very friendly and it is a great place to stop on the way to Surprise Stadium. The only downside was the very weak coffee."}
{"text":"We found Bobbies only because someone else told us about this place. I have driven by several times and never noticed it. A great family style restaurant that is a little bit of a hole-in-the-wall but in a good way. The food is great and the prices are very reasonable. An ideal place for brunch. This is where the locals eat. The best keep secret in Sun City, so don't tell anyone."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant since 1989.  The food is great, the servers are attentive, and the price is reasonable.  Up until the current owners took over, we felt like just another patron with no personalized interaction.  We continued going there for the food and the price, not to mention the tradition established.  Now we've become acquainted with the owners and servers, and they make it a pleasurable experience every time.  We just recently learned that customers they had at their restaurant in Canada and who snowbird here, travel from various parts of the valley to eat at the restaurant and to visit with them.  I'd say that is quite a testament!"}
{"text":"There are many diner type restaurants here in Sun City. I have commented on a few. I was greeted immediately. The server asked me if I wanted a small table or a booth which I thought was very nice. I opted for the small table as I was dining solo. I ordered a patty melt with cheddar cheese instead of Swiss and fries. She asked me how I wanted it cooked, which you hardly get asked that anymore. I ordered it medium which is exactly as it came. Marbled rye and lots of juicy sautéed onions. The patty melt was perfectly grilled on both sides! Thank you! And thanks for the extra napkins. And the offer to give me a to go cup for my soda. I will be back to try different menu items!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the star of Sun City! Not only is the food out of this world, (Check out the chicken noodle soup, the noodles are homemade! When is the last time you have seen that!) the employees are friendly, helpful, and make you feel like part of the family. The owners are out and about checking on tables and making sure the place is running smoothly, and the servers are quick to make sure you get everything you could ever need as well as providing friendly conversation. This place is a testament to having good management, good staff, good food, and an environment where everyone genuinely cares about one another. I keep coming back to this restaurant for a variety of reasons, and the stellar food is just a bonus!   The salad bar is fresh, clean and well stocked, everything is perfectly chilled and well maintained. The soups as mentioned are fantastic, and every thing that we have ordered off the menu has come expertly prepared.  Amazing place, people and food. The trifecta that is very rarely found anymore."}
{"text":"I've been here maybe 6 or so times over the last couple of years and it has ranged from okay to pretty good.  Yesterday, it would be a stretch to call it okay. I ordered the grilled trout with green beans. I was told \"no, no substitutions for baked potato/french fries\". Although rather grudgingly it was okayed to give me some extra green beans in place of the potato.   I eat a lot of fish - both at home and out. This was the fishiest fish I've had in recent memory. I wouldn't order again. The green beans was a decent sized side - even considering it was somewhere in the vicinity of double order - mixed with onions and red peppers. Although I used my napkin to lap up the extra grease - guessing the onions and peppers were cooked in (too much) oil.  Service was good. If you want a roll that comes with your meal, you need to ask for it - that is the policy. The roll was not great, but it was quite warm and good. The \"butter\" looked like Shedd's Spread or something equally . . . ummm . . . \"delicious\".   The prices are good, but . . ."}
{"text":"So, this is really good if you're looking for old fashioned, heavy cooking. I happen to love that kind of stuff so I found it to be great. The hot roast beef sandwich is really good, covered in delicious gravy and served with mashed potatoes (with the skins in it). So good. My grandmother got the meatloaf. It reminded me of the meatloaf my mother used to make. Really good."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for salad bar, so came here for the first time.  The salad bar was standard fare. The lettuce was 2-3 days old and brown around the edges. The soup was broccoli cheese and it was good. When i brought my salad plate back to the table, there was a curly hair in my salad dressing.  Gross!  I ordered California Pannini for takeout for my husband ,  and ot wasn't grilled on a Pannini machine, it was cold. He said the slaw was good. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We had the salad buffet in the middle of the afternoon a couple weeks ago. We both had stomach aches later that day, pretty sure it was the broccoli salad it had a funny taste. Never again!"}
