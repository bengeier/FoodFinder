{"text":"I'm so glad I stopped in this great shop. I had an idea what I wanted but once talking through what ailed me, the guy at the front desk was super helpful.  Half a bottle of Johnny Apple later, I'm feeling much better. And it's no joke on the 2x ginger kick, I love it but buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Looove the unsweetened cashew milk matcha latte. And the amazing toasts. 

Perfect place for a chat with a friend or to do some reading or work."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and daughter. It was off the hook. Like, this place just became our new go-to for food. I'm not even a vegan and I loved it. The space is incredible: clean,  bright, minimal, and airy. The woman who owns the place was great (and apparently not phased by toddler mayhem).

I had the vegan \"egg\" salad sandwich. Talk about flavor! The salted avocado on the side was a great touch. 10/10 would eat again. My wife had the chili and she thought it was great (and she's super picky, like frustrating to dine out with picky). We split a grapefruit, orange, pineapple, and cayenne juice. Once again, Daily Press delivered. 

Next time, you're mine, Banh-mi."}
{"text":"What a fun cool vibe this place has! It is nestled in Gordon Square and while it is small inside the juices and smoothies really pack a punch! The staff is incredibly friendly and will answer any of your questions. I ordered the Date Shake and found it to be one of the best smoothies I have ever had in Cleveland! It just might be my new favorite. While the prices might seem a little hefty for some just remember that everything is made with high quality, fresh ingredients and everything is made to order."}
{"text":"Cute place with a nice selection of vegan food options. The acai smoothie was excellent along with their selection of juices. Will definitely be back- so many options to try on their menu! Great place if you're looking to be healthy but still have tasty options!"}
{"text":"This is a really good vegan option for soups, salads, and smoothies.  Today I tried the strawberry avocado toast.  It was delicious.  There was a little sweet with the strawberry, a little salty with the pepitas, and a smooth taste with the avocado.  Topped it all of with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie! The waitress was very pleasant and willing to answer all my questions about the different menu options.  The ambiance was very relaxing."}
{"text":"I took full advantage of the smoothie bowls they serve here! Probably the biggest smoothie bowl I've had here. I didn't have room in my tummy to finish it so I packed it in a cup and took it on the road with me. The shop is small but cute and has a home feel to it. I think you'd like this place ; )"}
{"text":"Great to have a place like this in Gordon Square. High quality vegan food and drink with exceptional service. Also, kombucha. Love that this place sells kombucha. This all coming from a carnivore (*pointing to self, \"this guy\").

We tried the chili and the egg salad sandwich. The chili had a dollop of a vegan-style mayo as a substitute for sour cream, and it really complemented the taste of the chili well. The chili itself was well seasoned and flavorful. The egg salad sandwich also had a great flavor with a similar scrambled egg-like texture.

Atmosphere: has a hybrid industrial/cozy feel, with high ceilings and cafe-esque counter-tops against the window. Seats about 15 or so people."}
{"text":"It's all Vegan! Hot soups, sandwiches, salad and baked goods! All VEGAN! Did I mention it's all vegan? But okay is actually awesome food,I had the pesto avocado toast with mozzarella and tomato, DELICIOUS! The avocado was perfectly ripe and the match with pesto and the mozz was a  recipe made in heaven. I also tried their raw carrot cake bite in maca(?) it was a tad flavorless but I'll chock it up to my tastebuds being in overdrive from my avocado!! As far as juices I had the beauty revival with acai, strawberries, banana, flax seeds and coconut oil, it was amazing too!! Overall it was so good, a bit expensive for my taste but the company paid so :p !!!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a delicious and healthy meal. I'm in love with their superfood salad. It has so much texture and flavor with all the seeds and crunchy lettuce and juicy strawberries. The vinaigrette dressing is wonderful because it's not too sweet and not to tart. This place is a bit pricey, but it's worth every cent because of how fresh everything is. I watched the woman make my salad and chop everything up.

The atmosphere is calm and relaxing too with a lot of natural light and pastel colors. I highly recommend stopping here! I don't know how I'm going to not eat here every time I'm around."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and very brave to open right before this winter season!!! I went on Saturday afternoon to meet a friend to try out the newest addition to the Gordon Square area. Promptly I was greeted by the sweet Milo. After looking through the menu and chatting with the owner, we decided I should try the Beauty Revival Smoothie with an addition of greens (kale and spinach). So delicious. When my friend arrived, she ordered the same and also the Italian Grilled Cheese. It came piping hot with a side salad. After trying a couple bites, I knew I would come back to get my own. The Banh Mi also sounds amazing and can come toasted. There is a side fridge where you can grab and go or stay with your daily pressed juice. If you bring back the bottle, you will get $1 off your next order. They also carry other items from Red Lotus Foods and the Bearded Bunch among others.

If you are in the area and want a no fuss quick lunch in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere, come to Daily Press. And you will be back for more..."}
{"text":"Love is an understatement. Not only is this place adorable but they allow dogs (major plus!)  and have such yummy, healthy food. I had a hard time choosing between items on the menu and then between all the juice options in the fridge. Finally, I went with the green bowl and it was phenomenal. I cannot wait to go back and get it again! Their juice was delicious, too. I forget the name of what I had but it tasted delightfully healthy, with just the right amount of each ingredient combined. 

You can turn any of their smoothies into a bowl topped with berries, granola, etc.Brilliant!  I just wish it was closer to my apartment so I could go all the time. It's so unique and the workers are all super nice. I am always in search of quaint, healthy places and I am so excited Daily Press exists!"}
{"text":"Such a cute spot. Very welcoming the minute you walk in with the decor and colorful interior. I love how the daily specials are written in the chalkboard so you immediately see them the minute you walk in the door. The food and smoothies are fresh and made right before your eyes. Juices are perfect for on the go and if you bring the glass bottles back, you get money off your next purchase. Jodi is friendly and knowledgeable about her menu if you have any questions like I did about the vegan products. It was nice to go somewhere to get a healthy and fresh meal. There are also cute little products from local vendors available for purchase. Stop by and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Cute little vegan, hipster spot. Doggies, window views of the street. Table and breakfast bar style seating. 

I actually went here looking for an Acai bowl (if you've never had one they are amazzzzzzing), however, upon arrival I found another bowl \"PB cup bowl\" and had to try, delicious!!! But, then again....who doesn't love: PB, banana, cacao, cashew, etc....am I right kids? All that deliciousness was tucked in my bowl topped with chia, granola and coconut! 

Inside you'll also find a cold fridge that houses such delicious things like: fresh pressed juices (made in house), raw foods and coconuts!

I topped the lunch off with one of the oatmeal choc chip cookies! And...I attempted to pet the rescue pup several times but she wasn't interested. 

Cool fact, the young lady behind the counter was a veteran like me so we talked about the \"good ol days\" lol

Awesome spot, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! I am neither vegetarian nor vegan, but I thought I would drop in for a snack because I had a gift card. I had their quesadilla (which had a great tasting cheese alternative!), and took their avocado toast and banana/berry toast home for later. The banana/berry toast was definitely my favorite - it was sweet and savory. The bread is pretty thick so I felt full and would not have been able to eat all of these in one sitting. I think the toasts are a little pricey still, but the quesadilla seems to be the going rate. I pop back in for a snack if I was in the area, but I live on the east side so I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"I come here several times a month and always look forward to my visits. I absolutely love the juices and smoothies. The food here is incredible as well, so fresh and tasty. 
Jodi Rae, who owns and runs Daily Press is also an amazing person. She is always friendly and happy to see us. I always enjoy seeing her cute little dog. 
Thanks for opening up in our neighborhood Jodi Rae!
Hope to come in soon."}
{"text":"We just had the Green Apple Cinnamon and the Citrus Elixir- awesome. 

This is a fabulous owner-operated business that was the first of its type in the neighborhood I believe.

They also make smoothies and small plates. This is a great place to have a daily \"meal\" and leave out a less-healthy option ya may have had instead.

My routine in the area is get my sweat on at Harness Cycle, then head down the street here and get straightened out with a healthy meal. The rest of the day is a dream."}
{"text":"VEGAN - so extra stars just for that. But really, it's a 5 star all on it's own. Such a cute little cafe with fresh juices and lots of healthy vegan options. I had the coconut curry soup - homemade each day - and made in small batches, so it's unique. My friend had the carrot soup and a salad. We loved it all. Next time I'm in the area, I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"When exploring a new city, one of my favorite things to do is check out local shops & cafés. My friend is all about a healthy & vegan lifestyle, so I was excited to try out vegan cream cheese and a new smoothie blend after eating donuts all weekend  The Peanut Butter Cup smoothie was really good, but I wasn't super impressed with anything else. Only one woman was working and she was incredibly frazzled. My bagel was pretty stale and my friend ended up returning two smoothies because of the taste. With all of the cool eateries on Detroit Ave, I'd suggest trying a different local spot."}
{"text":"How did this juice bar hook me? I was walking down an unfamiliar block of Gordon Square when I saw a simple sign with an arrow that said, \"Juice!\" ...and to think someone said chalkboard marketing was dead! 

This place is my new everything. When you walk through the door, Jodi's \"vicious\" attack dog Miles (a small Chihuahua) will promptly greet you and assess his ability to get food from you.  

The ambient, minimalistic feel of this juicery takes the cake. In very Andy Warhol-like fashion, there's a wire hanger wall of polaroids. Jodi keeps a polaroid camera, and customers can snap photos to hang. Most of the photos are faded from all the natural light that pours through the windows, but it's awesome nonetheless. 

Daily Press radiates this fantastic, community feel. I love that everyone in there always seems to know each other. As for juice, the \"Its Electric\" (cucumber, lemon, ginger, green apple, pineapple) might be my favorite green juice that I've ever ordered at any juicery, ever. It has a tart flavor but isn't overwhelming. In my eyes, this place can truly do no wrong. Stop in and see for yourself! Oh, and bring your glass bottle back for $1 off your next juice!"}
{"text":"New favorite spot in Cleveland ! Great price, huge portions, fresh taste, 10 stars if I could do it"}
{"text":"I love juice. I love vegan sandwiches. And despite being a crazy cat lady, I like small dogs who hang out in cafes. Daily Press has all of these things. 

My fiance and I stopped in for some lunch on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed some juice and grub while getting sad eyes from the little doggie (Miles, I think?) who wanted some of our lunch. I had a green juice that was solid and we split some chili. The chili was good but the sour cream on top was amazing. Almost too real tasting to be vegan. I had the tofu bahn mi which was also solid, but I had a bite of my fiance's Italian grilled cheese and it was amazing. (so amazing that I have since recreated the sandwich at home because I liked it THAT much) Our sandwiches were served with a side of sliced avocado. I wish I could get a side of avocado everywhere, honestly. Yum!

Bottom line - if you're into juice or vegan food or are just looking for a place with a nice chill vibe, check this place out."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday a woman was working. She was so nice because we were a group of 5 so she had to make all our orders. I ordered a egg sandwich and a slice of toast. The wait was worth it! So good!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and super cute decor that just makes you smile. I had the peanut butter cup smoothie and boy was it delicious and filling. My only complaint/comment is to say that their prices are on the higher end of juices and smoothies in cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Tuesday morning and enjoyed some avocado toast, an oatmeal cookie, and split a bottle of juice. You can get a frequent customer card and they'll take $1 off your next order if you return the glass bottle. The full menu wasn't available yet but we were told soon!"}
{"text":"The coffee is great! Not the best place if you're in a rush, but overall good. Quiet, laid back, and original. I'd definitely recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute.  I have recently been obsessed with Acai bowls and this is the only place I've found besides restore that has them.  The prices are right on point with Restore as well, however they have more options.  I got the acai bowl, matcha latte and pesto avocado toast for 20$.  Both were amazing.  They do not skimp on the avocado at all!  The person I was with got the kale smoothie in a bowl form, the green juice, the super salad and egg salad to go.  I would like to go back and try more of their vegan menu.  The owner was super nice and the place is dog friendly.  Decor is adorable.  I like that they have takeaway items but we went later in the afternoon and looked like they were sold out of some of them.  It was a great recovery meal after a spin class at Harness down the street."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place and stopped in for a Saturday late breakfast. The shop is small but super cute. Comfy chairs and colorful decor. We ordered the strawberries and cream smoothie bowl, and the peanutbutter chocolate smoothie bowl. Both were so delicious!! You can order smoothies or smoothie bowls, where they add grains, granola and fruit. They make all their smoothies with a made in house nut milk that made them nice and creamy. 

They also have toasts, bagels from Cleveland Bagel Co, sandwiches and spreads, as well as pressed juices available. 

While we were eating, a mom and daughter walked in for some drinks to take out, and the mom was telling the associates how much she loves their juice cleanses, and is going to do one every month! There was also coffee available, and when brewed it made the place smell amazing. Also, everything in the store is vegan, which is awesome especially if you are lactose intolerant like me :)

Street parking was easy to find, and free on the weekend. There are lots of cute places in the area, so park your car and take a little stroll around!"}
{"text":"I stopped in last night for a quick bite. I needed something fast and hearty. As a non-vegan, I asked for a recommendation and chose the Vegan Pulled \"Pork\" Sandwich--it was amazing! I have been thinking about it all day today and I'm looking forward to going back for more."}
{"text":"loved the smoothie bowl i got from here, it was basically an acai bowl. i got the strawberry cream one and even though it wasn't on the menu she still made it for me and it was delicious! she ran out of granola but made sure to give me extra everything else which i thought was super nice. even though it is a little pricey, it definitely filled me up and then some, it's worth the $"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Their toasts are so good! The berry toast with the cashew spread and berries is to die for. Also, the avocado toast was so flavorful on the best bread! Perfect lunch spot if ever in Thai neighborhood. Cute inside too!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm juice!

So, I did really enjoy the juice here. It was good, tasty, fresh, cleansing, etcera. The hours were a little strange- the owner was about to close even though her hours were posted later, but I told her we would be coming in! When I called on a Saturday night, she asked me if I was really was coming in because she was thinking of closing early.. Which I assured her we were! And off we went. (Note to readers- if you're not sure if they're open, just call).

We got the beauty revival smoothie- it was tasty- acai, coconut milk, strawberry, chia seeds- lots of good stuff. He ordered the tropical- also a very clean refreshing smoothie to enjoy.

Sadly, the place seemed out of a lot of different things we wanted to order- soup, chili, etc. I settled on the lobster roll- it was hefty, came with a good salad, and it was decent. He ordered the avocado toast- which was mashed up avocado with cilantro on bread. It was good, but I thought it was a little pricey for what it was? Whatever, we were hungry! Nothing mind blowing but it's was decent.

Anyways, I did enjoy the smoothies here and would definitely come back for them. The food was alright- but definitely stop in for the juice and smoothies!"}
{"text":"I have tried a few juices and none have disappointed. The girl who runs the place knows her juices. I had some with cilantro to get this metal out of me. I think it worked. The beet juice turned my urine pink which was alarming yet fun. I may try to make my own juice of beet and asparagus to get a stinky pink concoction of waste. Or recommend it to this place. The dog that hangs out here is adorable and a good replacement for Todd the Cat that used to hang at Hausfrau."}
{"text":"i want to start off this post by saying i've had really good experiences here. the toast is yummy (a little overpriced) but good. today i came in to get a shot of their immune boost, some coffee, and some toast. the woman behind the counter took 10 plus minutes to make this toast. they were out of coffee(???) and the shot i wanted to get wasn't there. came out to my car on my way to work to eat this toast and the avocado, as you can see, was hard and not smashed. the toppings were thrown on the toast, and there was hair in it. i spit it out my window. spent 7 dollars on my way to work on this. disappointed & honestly want my money back. won't be coming here again."}
