{"text":"Went here for restaurant week after hearing about the fabulous views and a friend had mentioned seeing a write-up on the Chef in a magazine.  Well, I should have read the Yelp reviews before going, then I would have more realistic expectations.  I started with the tempura clams.  They were very good, but they were served with a dressing that tasted right out of the bottle from the grocery store.  My friend got an avocado appetizer which was less than impressive.  The second course we both got the Kobe beef ribs served over lo mein & bok choy.  We were both wondering why on earth if you are going to get one of the best cuts of beef on this planet WHY why why would you drench it in sauce ? Furthermore, the cut of beef was greasy and fatty and it was a short rib WITHOUT the bone.  We agreed the fat should have rendered off and it was not cooked properly for that to happen. Additionally, there was literally a pool of lo mein sauce at the bottom of the bowl.  For dessert we both got the dulce de leche cheesecake with blueberry compote.  It was a rich, dense round 3\" disk if you like that, but personally I like a lighter cheesecake [cheesecake factory's dulce de leche cheesecake is MUCH better and larger portion].  Sorry, but I make better blueberry compote and I'm not a chef. My friend got a glass of wine ($11.50) and I got a hot tea ($3.50).  The tea was amazing... lavender earl grey.  The waitress was very pleasant and prompt. Valet Parking was $7.  Bottom line, go for the view, drinks, and an appetizer but don't waste your money on the food."}
{"text":"Service was poor - waiter brought us a check that was double the amount ours should be and seemed totally confused when we pointed it out

Food was only ok - nothing special enough to warrant the price - the nachos were cold and the tuna and salmon were hardly seasoned 

Worst part - valet returned our car to us after a rain shower during our meal. Got out and handed us the keys only for us to discover the front leather console and seats were drenched with water. Valet admitted to opening the sunroof and letting the water in. Managers response was \"well what do you want me to do about it?\"

We won't go there again"}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary here. We had the ahi tuna nachos, duck fried rice, and the calamari for appetizers. The ahi tuna nachos were good but were swimming in sauce so I just picked out the tuna. The duck fried rice had a lot of flavor but was very salty. The calamari didn't have a crispy breading. For entrees, we had the wagyu steak and the scallops. The steak was average. They put 2 huge stalks of broccoli on the plate that was difficult to eat. The scallops were so salty I couldn't eat them. For dessert we order the chocolate and vanilla buttermilk ice cream. The chocolate ice cream was very rich and the vanilla tasted as it is named... Like buttermilk. We received a complimentary dessert of 2 bite sized peanut butter pies with \"happy anniversary\" written on the plate and a candle (which was the best item we had here). 

Overall the whole meal was so salty. The atmosphere is great and the patio with the view is the main attraction. If we go again, we may try the pizza. Everyone seemed to have ordered that around us, which should've been a sign."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Farenheit. The service was slow the fist time but not unbearably slow. Tonight was a completely different story. The food is good but not spectacular and not worth the price they charge for it.  It took forever to receive our appetizers and even longer for our entree. Then, to top it off,  I had to get the manager to expedite the process of paying our bill. Needless to say, I won't be going back unless they pick up the service game."}
{"text":"This place definitely has one of the best happy hours in Tremont. The food portions are very generous for $5 - $6 and good quality as well. I had the vegan ravioli, which was well flavored and enough food for an entire meal. The shrimp tacos are also outstanding. The drink specials include $5 seasonal cocktails, which are usually very tasty. All in all, five stars for the happy hour!

However, I recently went here for dinner and was not as impressed. While the food was decent to pretty good, the service was very sub-par. My party of 4 waited for nearly 30 minutes to place our order after sitting down. It's a small restaurant and didn't seem under-staffed but for some reason our waiter was not around much. I hope this isn't usually the case, but it was enough to make me not want to return any time soon. To the food: I ordered the lobster mac and cheese, and my dining partner the hangar steak. For the price of my dish ($25), I was a bit underwhelmed with the amount of lobster though it was a big dish of pasta. Tasty, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I would love to give 5 stars but..... The filet dish was inedible. We had a waiter-in training so I didn't want to upset him. He was very timid but very nice. 

That said, the bacon wrapped chorizo figs were delicious and my husband's short ribs were worthy of food fantasies."}
{"text":"Wasnt expecting much but the husband wanted to come dine in before leaving the Queen city.

We ordered only small apps to kill time. We tried the soup, chorizo stuffed dates, and Charlotte nachos.

The soup I believe how the server described it \"beef and bone marrow wonton soup\"?????? I was like WTF.. Whatever it was..........

IT. WAS. DELICIOUS. SO RICH AND STRONG.
best wonton soup I've ever had. Surprisingly too.

The dates and nachos were great as well.

My only concern is the noise level.
I think they need a wall barrier from the bar to the dining room.

My husband and I just wanted a nice, quiet, meal but that wasn't going to happen.

Please do something about the noisy bar, unless you don't care about my review and the rest of the 100 + people who have said the same thing on here ."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever eaten. We went during restaurant week. $33 for an app, entree and dessert. The short rib was perfect. Our server Heather was kind and very knowledgeable on the meal. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to have a date night last night so we drove all the way from vermilion to eat here for our first time. Everything was EXCELLENT. Our waiter, Kevin, was very helpful and knowledgeable and very proper. We split the mussels appetizer with the tomato & basil broth. Amazing. Then my fiancé had the pork shank and I had the hog snapper. Both were absolutely tremendous. I will highly recommend this restaurant to anyone! Not to mention, they totally had the best music station playing!"}
{"text":"I really love the idea of Fahrenheit, but somehow it's let me down each time I've been.  I hope to be able to up the rating to 4 stars with some more visits.  

The atmosphere gets bonus points.  I've sat a bar table on a hopping Friday night.  Although the place was slammed, we didn't feel rushed or unloved.  The mood was vibrant, and it was fun to watch the food come out of the kitchen.  I've also been late on a wintry weekday when the place was pretty dead.  I couldn't help but think how romantic it seemed, with the faint lighting and diners tucked into corners like worlds of their own.  (I did not partake of this ambience, as I was dining with my sister, but still, the couple nearest us seemed to be enjoying their date.)

The food is mostly what disappoints.  I like the idea of most things on the menu, and some are done well.  But nothing wows, and a few things disappoint.

I can vouch for the meatball appetizer.  Nothing special, but solid delicious meatballs.  The sliders were fine, but with way too high a bread-to-meat ratio.  And even though I prefer burgers well-done, I think I ruined them by requesting that.  They were really dry and charred.  The edamame hummus sounded exciting, but was not much more than bread and hummus.  Cuyahoga flatbread was also fine, but the bacon and foie gras flavors were barely there.  My sister did love the cheese plate, especially the combination of the quince paste and one of the cheeses (I forget which one).  Nice that they're local cheeses.

We tried a pizza once, just to try it and then have it leftover.  I can't even remember which one it was.  Again, solid, but nothing special, particularly with all the fancy pizzas you can get these days.  Probably on par with bar cento pizzas.  The pumpkin ravioli was extremely disappointing.  Just oily and gummy and flavorless.  Maybe because it was the end of the night, but I don't think that's a valid excuse in such a place.  I can't remember what I've tried before the Winter Menu.

I do like anywhere that changes the menu seasonally, highlights local products, and where the chef has a presence.  But I was a bit embarrassed that I chose here as one of the examples of Cleveland's culinary greatness to show off.  Not quite good enough food for the special occasion.  But worth stopping in for the bar menu and a happy hour drink."}
{"text":"5 stars for the atmosphere and 5 stars for the food. Lobster Mac and cheese is to die for and so Is the steak. Staff is friendly and knowledgable. They have a great wine menu As well. If you're looking for a lively place to start your weekend with an upscale menu and views, then Fahrenheit is the place to be. Be sure to book early. It tends to get booked up quickly. This little note was after two visits and both experiences were comparable."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant! Calamari with kimchee was exceptional!  Lamb sliders and stuffed dates also delicious!! The only star lost was on service. We had reservation for 730. We arrived at 705. It did not look busy and there were open tables; however, we did not get a text for seating until 750! We opted for the bar, and after that, we were golden!!!"}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere, view and food.  You can be health conscience coming here but why?  We start off with the Charlotte nachos and they are delicious!  The salad with mixed lettuce is wonderfully finished with the miso vinegarette (if you feel guilty about the nachos or not).
Whatever entree we have had, we have enjoyed and definitely leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"The only thing this restaurant has going for it is the view. We basically had to beg to be served at the bar and then the beer was warm.  Service just as bad once seated. 20 mins to get a drink, really?  The food is just average. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great view, but drinks are very pricey. $11 for crown & ginger and $8 for OMB copper."}
{"text":"Location, Location, Location. Food and drinks are pricey for what they are, I'm not one to complain about the price of food or drinks, but they were nothing I'd brag about. The view is what did it for me, seeing all of Charlotte while dining is a nice treat. The elevator is a bit confusing if it's your first time, but it's an issue that's easily overcome. The service wasn't too impressive, but overall not horrible. 
I wouldn't go there on the regular, but it's fun to bring people new to Charlotte or just visiting."}
{"text":"I'm taking the time to write this because I honestly believe great employees deserves to be recognized. I came to Fahrenheit Friday night for the first time. Your cocktail waitress, Camille, very pretty young lady was beyond patient with my indecisiveness of what I wanted to drink. She was knowledgeable of the cocktails, helped me to ultimately choose the Easy Plateau and Oh My Gosh, it was beyond delicious. I think her touch from bringing it from the bartender made it even more special because of her great customer service. Then to have the beautiful view of Charlotte, it made me feel like I was in some movie. Anyways.... Due to Camille, she bolstered Fahrenheit reputation with me. She portrayed the right image that every company wants their employees to show! I will continue coming here because of her and will recommend my co-workers to come, as well. I would happily pay for a reward or recognition for Camille, that's the kind of impression she left on me as a first time customer."}
{"text":"Went here for date night with my husband. The service was terrible, slow and rude from the minute we walked in to see the hostess. The food is mediocre, after we had an appetizer the waitress asked if we wanted dessert... um no but we can take a hint and the check. At one point a woman walked in with her froofroo dog, then some girls in the bathroom were talking about when their coke was going to kick in, these things made us realize this overpriced pretentious place is not for me. Ever"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Had the mushroom pizza, grilled cauliflower, shwezwan green beens, kale salad and lobster mashed potatoes. It was really outstanding and it was so good - tonight was my second night in a row.  Even with overcast and clouds, the view on the deck is very nice. The bar staff needs work.  The bartenders were polite but not friendly, not engaging and didn't smile. Is that too much to ask?  The bar should be staffed with pretty people who are dynamic and engaging and crack a smile!  Aside from the automatons behind the bar, everything else was stellar.  Because the food was that good, it made up for the bar staff. I highly recommend before it get's too hot to hang on the roof top deck."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is everything you'd imagine and more, the outdoor fireplaces just add to it whether you are outside or sitting inside looking out. The service is exceptional, all the staff know the menu and could answer even the strangest of questions/requests. 

The cauliflower appetizer was so so yummy. I wouldn't expect that from cauliflower!! I got the short ribs as an entree and they were so savory and delicious. I wouldn't think to put a big hunk of meat with lo mein noodles, I'm a meat and potatoes person but I was shocked at how amazing this dish was!!

An added bonus, they have all local beers on tap, I love keeping it close to home! Will definitely go back(and often)!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it...I really did.  Sadly our experience was mediocre at best. 

I'll start with the pros:
-Friendly and attentive staff
-Beautiful patio and views of uptown
-Yellowtail sashimi appetizer and crab legs entree were tasty

And now, the not so good.  We'll start from the beginning.  Parking is nonexistent.  From what we could tell, the only option was to valet, which was not complimentary (as most valets are for restaurants uptown).  When you choose a location for a restaurant that does not have parking, and literally the only option is to valet, that service needs to be complimentary.  We made reservations for 4:45pm (we have a small baby and needed to be back for bedtime).  We were basically the first people seated for the evening, yet they put us at a sad little table against the wall instead of one of the awesome tables with a view by the windows...tables which remained unseated for the majority of our visit.  They then crammed a loud group of probably 12+ people right beside us, despite the rest of the restaurant being relatively empty.  The food was just ok.  Nothing really bad about it...but not amazing.  Certainly not worth the $200 check.  The valet had instructed us to hand our valet ticket to our waiter for validation...so we're thinking maybe guests of the restaurant don't have to pay the $10 valet fee.  Wrong...the validation provides a $3 discount.  Really?  Why even bother?  And the grand finale...when we stood up to leave, I realized my knee had been resting in a rather unpleasant pile of GUM on the bottom of the table!  I mean this restaurant has been open for a week tops.  I haven't even gotten gum on my pants at a 20 year old McDonald's, let alone a brand new \"high end\" establishment.  So basically, I spent $200 to eat bland food and ruin my pants.  They did offer to pay for my dry cleaning bill, which was very nice.  It's not their fault some low class moron put gum under the table...but I do think if I were an experienced high end restauranteur that would be something I instructed servers to quickly check for before opening every night.  

Again every staff member we came into contact with was very friendly, I have no complaints in that department.  But overall, this restaurant just seems like an overpriced Applebees with a  pretty view."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: Don't let the view distract you from the food which is great. Oh, and look past those there to be seen rather than dine ;-)

My better half and I made a reservation for a Friday evening and had a wonderful time. The only hitch was at the beginning of the evening when we had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Someone needs to fix the scheduling/booking system.

Fahrenheit seems to have attracted mixed reviews here on Yelp which could mean a mis-alignment of expectations or highly variable food quality.  All of our food was very good and bursting with flavor. Our server was great and yes, the view was superb.

Based on our recent experience I definitely recommend Fahrenheit and would return."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks, scene, and service. Put this in your must try list in downtown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Awesome views, incredible brunch menu (though no mimosas until noon, gotta love the south) and wonderful friendly and attentive service! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Well where do I start. I made reservations for my husbands birthday. I specifically asked to be seated by the window. Also told them that we wouldn't mind waiting when we got there for a window seat. The lady I talked to on the phone had a 5:15 and a 8:45 reservation.  I was surprised that they had a 8:45 when online it said they closed at 9:00. I questioned the lady about it and she told me that 11:00 was when they closed. So we went with the 8:45 reservation. I asked them what did they do for birthdays and she told me that they would bring him out a complimentary cake.  When we arrived  we were told that there wasn't any window seats and that they closed in 15 minutes so we didn't have time to wait for one.  This had me highly upset because I specifically asked about this over the phone .  Whoever I made reservations with knew nothing about what they were talking about. I was going to leave but I decided to give the place a chance. I didn't get my window seat but I still had a very nice view from my table. We got  the charlotte nachos as the appetizer. It was tasty but could have been better if they would have put the toppings all over the nachos instead of one spot.  For the entree I got the grilled kurobuta  Pork shop and my husband got the Kobe beef short ribs.  My pork chop tasted burnt and almost made me throw up and the rice was nasty. I tried my husbands food and it was delicious . The beef short ribs melted in my mouth and the Lo mein was delicious.  I waited all the way up until we got the tab to see if they were going to bring my husbands cake out but they didn't. I had to remind them .  I'm giving this place two stars because they suck on customer service skills! I get better service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was really slow considering there were not many tables. I liked by braised short ribs but the price was a little high for what I got."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Fahrenheit Saturday night. We had drink at the bar before dinner closed our tab and signed the bill when our table was ready. We finished our dinner and went back to the bar and had two more drinks after our dinner. When we finished and were given our tab. Our original drinks were on the bill we had already paid for. We asked the bartender to remove them which they did but then she said they are authorized to leave peoples tabs open after they sign them and close out. This is obviously not right so we asked to speak with a manager. Adam Quigley service manager came up and said it is more important for his bartenders to face the people at the bar then worry about the closing out tabs when people leave. Here is my question....we are vigilant about everything surrounding our credit cards, how many people pay no attention at all and how much extra money is Fahrenheit charging people?"}
{"text":"My husband and I made a 530 reservation, walked in at 520 and sat down to a basically empty restaurant which was great! We left our two babies at home so we were happy to be somewhere quiet. Put our order in by 540....sat and sat and SAT. At 615 finally got our appetizer and at 630 we still didn't have our meals. We had been there over an HOUR with a reservation. 

Maybe this would have been ok if the restaurant was really busy? Our waitress, who was super sweet and very good at her job, said there was a large take out order that pushed our meals back. Ok. BUT....two tables away there was a family who was clearly friends with the owner? Manager? Someone who...got their meals within 20 minutes of sitting down. And then the manager or owner or someone sat at their table with them which explains the fast service they received. 

The food was good! But I would have rather spent time and money somewhere where they respect their customers time and money. It felt like we were shunned, unwelcome guests or something. 

Thanks for the free appetizer to try to make up for the unbelievably long wait for our food. Probably won't be returning and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Cool spot, with awesome views of downtown/uptown Charlotte. Drinks are pricey, but delicious. Defiantly worth the view. We went on a Friday evening and it was probably one of the quieter bars in Charlotte. Quick service, lots of servers walking about. 

The butler was my favorite cocktail 

Defiantly worth a visit"}
{"text":"We've eaten here four times and it's getting much better.  We've had choppy service before but this week it was outstanding and the food was the best we've had.    Steak, salmon, braised pork and steamed buns, all excellent!   The desserts were really good, too.  And above and beyond everything, it's got the absolute best view and skyline vibe in Charlotte!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Worst service, smells dirty - the only thing that makes it at all worth the ride up to the bar is the view and it's nothing you couldn't get at the Ritz - don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I loved the salmon cooked to perfection with just enough crisp great with the wasabi mash potatoes. Outdoor patio was very relaxing. Our waitress Kiera was very polite and made sure we were taken care of. Just wished that the bread would have been ready prior to our meal, would recommend though."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit was good. I wouldn't put it in the same category as Lola, Chinato, or L'albatros but it was good. The Kobe beef short rib was not only tender and flavorfull but it was a generous portion size to say the least. Although I enjoyed it I'm not sure that everyone would as it was very salty. I tend to like a lot of salt on my food so it didn't bother me but it would have probably been too much for some people. My girlfriend ordered the shrimp and scallops which were also good, not great. There was A LOT of lemon on it which was over powering. The best things that we had were the bacon wrapped dates. Wow. It was definitely just a sample size as the portion was very small but it was worth it. They were great! The bread and butter was also phenomenal as the butter was very unique. The problem was that there wasn't much bread and the waitress didn't seem to want to give us more. My girlfriend and I went last for a special occasion and it wasn't the best ambiance. It was very loud and we could hear the chefs fighting and swearing at each other which was interesting. I will probably go back eventually but am in no hurry."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner at this restaurant for the first time. Immediately when we walked in we were greeted and a table was ready. There was a group of people at a table next to us who seem to be having fun but was extremely loud. We asked to be seated at another table because it was hard to hear one another talk with so much noise. We were immediately seated somewhere else and we began to place our orders: 

Drinks 
Not good at all!  Pinot Grigio is one of my favorite drinks. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio but when I got the drink it didn't smell like a hint of what I'm use too. However, i gave it a taste but my glass of wine didn't taste like what I ordered. I tried to order another glass but same results. I have a good palate when it come to wine and it just didn't taste like Pinot Grigio. What seem unusual the other person at the table said their brand vodka did not taste like the brand they ordered. I decided to try another white wine which was ok. 
(1star for the drinks)

Food
I ordered the salmon which turned out be flavorful and really delicious. I like my food HOT! It wasn't as hot as I would like but it was still good. It looked so good a person at another table asked what did I order on the menu lol. The entire table was satisfied with the food (4stars for the food and 5 for the atmosphere) 

Overall
The food was flavorful, atmosphere was great, service was good, and everyone was friendly!!  After leaving the dinning area we went out to enjoy Fahrenheit outside patio and the view of Queen City."}
{"text":"Great views and quick service! I tried to make reservations online but they were booked. I rolled the dice and arrived around 7, we were able to get seats in the bar area. We ordered the lobster rolls for the app, salmon and scallop entries. To our surprised they all came out at the same time but it was within 15 mins of us ordering so we were happy. The water did taste a little funny but the food was so good it didn't matter. They have valet as well."}
{"text":"Come for the view and the cocktails- not the food!!!  Sitting outside and enjoying a well crafted cocktail and soaking in the view is what this place should be known for.  Their Moscow Mule is one of the best I have had, and their outdoor space is trendy, but relaxing.

The food on the other hand is trying to hard to be hip, and far from delicious.  I would never recommend grabbing more than an app here (and that's if you are really hungry).  It's overpriced for the quality and totally not worth it given all the delicious places to eat Uptown"}
{"text":"My first Yelp review because this service is terrible. Told the waitress I do not want a miso glaze on my steak...2 hours later the steak comes with a steak sauce (hello?! No sauce period!). Andrew, the manager, sucks. Just told me ok that's the Demi glaze and stared at me with a blank look. Save yourself the trouble and just go to cap grille and ask for Petey, he'll take great care of you."}
{"text":"We had a girls night out here,it was amaizing, food was delicious, service was great and the atmosphere and the view is unbelievable. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! The service was awful!! We were doing an event there. The person to call was never available and when finally got a hold of her she didn't have any info of whether there available space or not. So we waited another day and another 20 calls to see if she would call back. The food was severely over priced for what it was and the staff wouldn't even give the time of day. THE ONLY THING TO GO FOR is the view."}
{"text":"I could only give this place 2 stars for the overall experience.  The view is 4 stars for sure, the food was average I expected better more even flavor between the diverse dishes we choose but a 1 star for the attitude of the hostess.  If it weren't for my setting this reservation as an after business dinner with out of town execs, I would have personally left and never returned.  They were more than unfriendly and quite snobbish.  Too bad, since I had being excited about visiting this restaurant for months.  I may return for the view and cocktails, while choosing to dine elsewhere.  Maybe!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little pretentious. It has a nice view but the hostess made it seem as though reservations were the only way to get a spot... Even though we sat right down in the bar area \"first come first serve\". The service wasn't anything I would rave about for being such a \"fancy\" restaurant. The ambiance doesn't match the food or service. 
I got the duck confit fried rice and it was ok. I expected a little better all around. 
The view is what you truly pay for all in all."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been looking forward to eating at #fahrenheit since we moved to Charlotte, NC. We were extremely disappointed with our experience this past Friday. The service and view was great but the food was not. I ordered the grouper special and couldn't cut my fish because it was not cooked all the way. This completely ruined my appetite for the evening. They ended up giving me a nasty kale salad while they made me scallops. I was so nervous to eat the scallops because I didn't trust that they cooked them correctly. Overall I was completely bummed out to spend over 90 dollars on a special meal that was not so special. H"}
{"text":"Beautiful views. Terrible bar service. The bartender was clearly not happy to be there & it was felt by the customers she served. It was as if we were bothering her to order a drink. Unfortunately a key aspect of return customers is good service & atmosphere. But when u leave feeling like we shouldn't have come here...you lose those potential return customers."}
{"text":"Ahhhmazing! We had a wonderful time eating a late dinner. The rock shrimp app was amazing, & the bread was delish! We had the short ribs (which were perfect and tender) love the flavours. I had the filet mignon which and impeccable as well, perfectly cooked med rare. We saved a bit of room for dessert as well! I had the pana cotta, it was awesome. My first time trying the dish, I loved the balsamic and basil additions it was incredible. My mother had the Pot de creme and she love that as well! Overall a amazing dining experience due to our great waitress and the always wonderful Chef Matt."}
{"text":"We were staying at Hyatt hotel within the same building as the restaurant so we decided to check it out. We came on a Friday night after dinner so we can just have some dessert and check out the views of the city. It's located on the 22 floor, pretty much at the top of the building. The views of the city are amazing. It really sets a nice ambience while you are dining. This is a nice place to go on a date. Our server was Kala. She was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and just food in general. She was also very enthusiastic, funny and attentive. She helped us with our dessert and drink selection. I ordered the adult milkshake chocolate flavor with a shot of Rumchata based on her recommendation and it was delicious. I literally could have finished it in one gulp but I wanted to savor the flavor as long as I could.

I can't really speak for any other food because I didn't try any but the ambience and service alone merit another visit. Be prepared though as this place is not cheap. However you cannot beat the view, which is probably the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nothing but a view to see here. First, opens @ 4pm but when i walked in @ 3:58pm, because the door was open, the hostess turned me back outside just to turn around & welcome me back in 2 min later. Then it took for ever to get a beer even though there were very few customers. The bartender seemed to be annoyed of having to serve but finally took my order. Began pouring my beer & the keg went dry. Rather than waiting for me to pick another drink, he left. Finally came back & took my order. Then I asked if they could change the channel on the tv to the USA soccer game & the manager did not allow it. When I confronted the manager he said that they were not a sports bar even though they were currently showing golf & basketball. Check please!"}
{"text":"The View! The Fire! That is pretty much it. I had dined there with my business partner and we both were not impress with the food. No flavor, kind of bland. It sounded great on the menu, but even the look of our dishes was were disappointing.

 Maybe it is a good place to hang out and have a drink or 2, the crowd there was hip, dressed up and trendy. Not recommend for dining."}
{"text":"This place makes me so happy. I really enjoy the food, but even more so the atmosphere. The way the tables are set up and the lighting is all so sexy and romantic. It's like a really nice bottle service/champagne lounge / restaurant. It reminds me of the really nice casino restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I could eat their bacon wrapped dates for dinner! I have eaten here twice and it's worth every cent. The meat is cooked perfectly and they served us a banana cheesecake that was such a surprise! Just when I thought a
I was too full to eat anymore-I couldn't stop eating desert!"}
{"text":"6 dollars for a coke and you can't leave with it even though I'm staying in the hotel literally right below it in the same building. Very overpriced. Nice view that's about it. Ahi nachos come with a lot of chips and not much tuna"}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for a rare date night last month. He had been wanting to try it for a while so I secretly made arrangements and surprised him. 

The atmosphere was nice - my only real complaint overall about the place was that even though it was over half empty and we had made a reservation well ahead of time, they chose to seat us at a table right next to the front door. Drafty, cold, and felt like we got a little less of a nice, intimate setting. Just a really odd decision by the staff. 

At least they made up for it with the food! We had the 3 for $30 meals (were happy these were offered) and it was SO much food. Next time we would order one between the two of us and maybe an appetizer or something. We tried nearly everything it seemed! They start you off with bread and a sweet honey butter and olive tapanade at the table. Warning: You are going to be tempted to fill up on this bread because it's yummy - don't! There is much, much more coming! For appetizers, we had the thai meatballs and the chicken spring rolls. Both were wonderful. The Kobe beef short ribs and the mustard and coffee crusted pork for entrees. We each like the other's better so I guess they were both good. Just beware that the mustard and coffee crusted pork was a little sweet overall. If you are looking for something more savory, go with the beef (or something else). Dessert was the roasted apple crostada and the chocolate lava cake. Chocolate lava cake was really, really, really rich. Absolutely delicious but would be very hard to eat if you aren't a big dessert person. The apple crostada was just overall good. 

We would definitely come back in the future for a special night!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited last evening for restaurant week in Charlotte. Food was okay, nothing special. We both had the egg rolls for an appetizer. For my entree I had the glazed salmon over mashed potatoes and why wife had the lobster mac and cheese. All of this sounds positive right? So why the 2-star? Our server tagged my bill for a large party gratuity of 20% and never informed us. There were 2 of us in the party. WTF? I can't believe they have the ability to use this at their leisure. Most restaurants allow this for party's of 6 or more. For the record I left him another $20 to make a point, don't judge a book by its cover. I'll never eat here again because of the service."}
{"text":"I received a gift card to this place and I'm glad I did. It was wonderful! Good service, good food and nice ambiance. A little pricey, but the food and martinis are so good, it's expected."}
{"text":"I would give it 0 stars if I could. This place is overpriced dog food. The only thing they have going for them is the view. Valet is $7 with validation. No coat check.  No spirits list. Cheap fluorescent lighting that is seizure inducing. Service is uncaring and intermittent.  Menu's are like something out of Showmars. No water options besides tap. Nothing to munch on (bread, etc) is provided. Pizza was burnt and too much Rosemary. Calamari was disgusting. Slight glimmer of hope on the short rib buns. Scallops destroyed by the cream of wet dog and sand like bits. Oh, and it's impossibly loud, so good luck understanding your server or trying to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I love the views from 21st floor at Fahrenheit. Close to the lynx as well."}
{"text":"Great walleye, the best I have ever had !!!

Good service and atmosphere 

My only negative is that the portions were a little small for what you pay for, I'm talking about the tomato soup and salad I ordered"}
{"text":"Came in town for work and have heard this is a great new restaurant to try. View is great, prices for apps and pizza are fair, main courses over priced but remember it is a \"hotel restaurant\".  Food is fine-eclectic seafood-beef-but all over the place.  Staff was nice but did not come back often.  Have never heard of owner/chef but supposedly I should according to the staff???  Would say come have cocktails for the view etc, but grab dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have never dined at this restaurant so my one star is based on customer service from the below experience. On Saturday, December 10, around 9:30 PM (east coast time), I was at home in Northern California when I received an alert on my phone that my debit card was used at this restaurant. An employee processed my Debit card for the amount of $28.15. I called that evening and was told an employee would call me in the morning which I never received. I called later on Sunday, December 11, 2016 and the receptionists advised me that there system was slow and when it came back up, she would call me which she never did. I called on Monday, December 12, 2016 and spoke with the Monday receptionist at 11:00 AM who  took my message and advised me she would have the manager call me which he never did. I called at 5:30 PM Tuesday December 13, 2016 and talked to the receptionists who knew me by name and stated that both managers were in and she was going into their office after she hung up and make sure they received my message and to expect a call that evening which I never received. I woke up this morning and found the $28.15 pending charge now rose to $38.15. (Someone added a $10 tip). On Wednesday I sent an email to the business, left another message on the phone and messaged Chef Rocco Whalen on his Facebook about this and still no response.This has caused me to cancel my debit card, requiring me to contact all my online billing accounts to have the new account posted and file an affidavit with my bank. Highly recommend that if you do dine here, use cash or a credit card to avoid my experience."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit was not an overall bad experience. Maybe I had just heard too much built up about the place but by the end of the night I felt the place to be pretty overrated. 
The hotel parking is easy to get to which was a plus. From then on the night went downhill. The hostess could not find our reservation which we made weeks in advance. Maybe a simple mix up. 
Our waiter, while knowledgable about the menu items, seemed awkward and uncomfortable around our group. He spilled water twice while refilling glasses and accidentally dumped some leftovers of a plate onto my chair and leg. Not a big deal. Maybe he just had a bad night. 
The music in the place was rather loud and made it difficult to talk. Even away from the noise of the bar in the center of the restaurant. 
All in all the food turned out to be a weird mishmash of genres and styles of cuisine that didn't always successfully mesh. It seemed like the chef just threw together a lot of things that sound cool and appealing but just didn't work realistically together. 
I ordered Pad Thai and it was your run of the mill Americanized Asian dish. Also tried the mushroom ravioli that was overbearingly earthy. Almost to the point of bitterness. The steamed buns with Kobe beef were good but the sweetness overpowered the beef. Again, just odd combinations of food with eye catching ingredients to make you think you're getting something special. 

Here's the take-away:
You're paying for the view. The food is overrated. Service a little spotty. I would go again if invited, but would not choose to go as my own idea."}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here before?

DH and I both said that at least 2x during our visit. Well appointed bar, great service and the food! Pork shank was prepared to his satisfaction...a little bland for my taste, but it wasn't my entree so I didn't have the pleasure of sloshing that moist + tender pork in the veggies and sauce. I got the short rib. There's a good reason why it's a fan favorite. Packed with flavor, it is tender and juicy and expertly paired with the sides. Bravo, Fahrenheit. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"By far the best spot in Cleveland.  The food is outstanding as is the service.  Not crazy expensive however the quality and taste are as good as there is.  Rocco is a great chef and even better guy.  Great place to stop in and have an app and drinks or go all out for a great dinner.  Tremont is a special place and this is the best of Tremont."}
{"text":"Every time I went there, the customer service was nice and the food were great. I highly recommend this place. Little expensive but worth the money that I spent. Good place to take friends or family that visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is only a review of the bar/ scenery as I did not dine here.

This is the place to be to get a truly exquisite view of the city. 
The rooftop features an open air balcony with a beautiful sprawling fireplace. Perfect for when the weather is a bit chilling, but you still want to catch that amazing view. 

The bartenders worked fast and seemed to have everything under control with the bar that was fairly packed the night I attended."}
{"text":"my husband and i were very dissapointed with the food and the service. husband ordered the beef short ribs and said the sauce was to strong, then he ordered the salmon and said it was too salty, i ordered a burger and for $16 it was..ok. nothing caught our attention from the dessert menu, we love chocolate but the only chocolate they had was \"milk and cookies\"and something with coconut eww.  husband also orders lemonade to drink every time we go out and they didnt have any, if u dont drink alcohol theres not many beverage choices. food took to long to get us and we had to wait a while to be seated when we had reservations, I had mentioned over the phone it was my husbands birthday and he didnt even get a happy birthday. only good thing we got out of it was some nice pictures we took outside, and we went on a monday night, way to loud to talk."}
{"text":"Attention!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE ON A LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. I'm not sure I would go on any night of the week after the experience I've just had. For one, food is over priced for what you get. I ordered duck fried rice which was ok but on the salty side. About 15 mins before our food came out, when the waitress finally came back to get our orders, I asked for an Irish coffee. We were completely done eating our food and then some by the time this tepid coffee came out to the table. So let's just say I waited about 45 mins prob more for Irish coffee...and got charged for it. Should I have expected that? I just thought that was terrible customer service. You see me completely done eating and my husband is asking you for the check and you don't think umm maybe I should try to get this taken off. I get they were busy, but you have to have some sort of customer service so people will actually want to come back after having less than ok service. But I didn't even say anything because I genuinely was so annoyed I just wanted to leave and who knew how long it would take to fix the situation if I'd complained about something. I can't see a time I would ever come back here."}
{"text":"Really really really disappointed. 

My wife and I moved here about 5 years ago and always had this place on our bucket list. We finally got around to making a reservation and made the 40 minute drive from Mooresville. We got to the top of the building and were greeted by a friendly wait staff that invited us to have a drink while we waited for the rest of our party - a couple that we hadn't seen in a while. After a couple $15 dollar drinks, we made our way to the table. The waitress was friendly but distant and pressured us into some \"organic\" water that was distilled infinitely (?). We denied but she ended up charging us for it anyway. It was $1, I have a hard time complaining about that.  

The menu was so-so and I had a hard time finding something that I fell in love with. I asked the waitress if there were any features and she told me they were out... Which was strange because it was 6:00 at night, and it wasn't that busy. I settled on the flank steak with a Brussel sprout appetizer (I love Brussel sprouts).  My first course came out and let's just say I would have rather eaten a dish of raw Rosemary. The Brussel sprouts were cut like cole slaw and served with a peanuty vinegar. I felt like a rabbit and for the first time in my life, I couldn't bear to finish the dish. 

My flank steak arrived with a cup full of French fries and a stalk of uncooked broccoli. Steak was cut already which I found strange and not well marinated. The fries were the best part, albeit salty. 

Dessert time came and I stayed away.. I couldn't bear getting disappointed again. I stuck with a mediocre cup of coffee which must have been Folgers or some other generic brand. Im actually really sad about this meal, I really wanted to have a good meal with my friends. Instead I felt motivated to write this melancholy review on Yelp. 

We ended up paying $200 for this meal which is heftier than we had planned for two people. I don't mind paying that kind of money for a tremendous meal, but I would have gotten a better meal at Applebee's. Do yourself a favor, stop at Fahrenheit for a drink, go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place are the views.  The food is terrible at any price but yes, is especially overpriced.  The menu is a provincial chef's idea of \"fancy\"- \"Exotic\" ingredients, \"fusion\"  etc.  Our food arrived as if it had been reheated.  Without a doubt the worst thing about the place is the staff- whether the unsmiling surly hostesses who unhelpfully stand around doing nothing or servers who take forever to take orders. Whereas the decor is trying to be sophisticated, it has more of a suburban housewife's idea of glamorous.  Hopefully better restaurants will open nearby."}
{"text":"Ill start by saying that the service is very good and our waitress was very helpful. They also have a good drink selection. We tried a number of things to share. I would skip the Cleveland nachos and go with the veal meatballs. We also tried the pork belly that came with these amazing brussel sprouts (my fave part of the meal!). The pork belly is just OK---at least ours was, tasted burnt.
The beet salad is an actual salad with a few beets.....just an FYI but a good salad. We then got the lobster and brie pizza which if you like seafood pizza, you would like. 
It came recommended as one of Cleveland's best. I like this place for their selection of food. The menu is very creative but the quality I gave three stars."}
{"text":"We went here recently for a company party.  The server and bartender were nice and on point.  The atmosphere and the view were GREAT!  But the food are very pricey but it was not   that great."}
{"text":"I ordered the Vietnamese spring roll to start and swordfish as my  main course. The spring roll was filled with a lightly seasoned ground meat which wasn't bad but wasn't anything special. The swordfish was a bit bland and the portion was a little small. The shrimp and scallops were prepared really well. The risotto that came with it tasted as if it had way too much parmesan and the purée was pretty bad. Add in a glass of red wine and a good tip for good service a bill around $60. I'll try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"First of all, my four star rating is based upon our dinner experience here, but the reason we stopped in here for dinner in the first place is because their Happy Hour is definitely a 5-star!  They offer good drink prices and a handful of appetizers, all excellent, for around $5 (I forget specific prices), as well as complimentary bacon at the bar, which is a unique touch.  Since my husband and I love their Happy Hour so much, we decided to grab dinner here for my husband's birthday last night.

Overall, I would say the food was great, but not the type of food that has such a \"wow factor\" that it stops you in your tracks and you can't get over it because you've never had anything so excellent before.  The server, though very friendly and also adorable with a great smile (I know it has nothing to do with our food lol), was slow to get our drink orders in and we noticed mid meal that he didn't provide all of the specials to us before we ordered, which was a bit disappointing but not a huge deal.  We were definitely feeling impatient while waiting for our cocktails, though; after a long work day, we really were looking forward to those!!

I ordered the Alaskan sockeye over Chinese broccoli and sweet corn, and my husband ordered the lobster mac and cheese.  The salmon was excellent and moist; some of the best I've ever had, and the lobster in my husband's mac and cheese was also excellent (it had the \"wow factor,\" for sure).  However, the Chinese broccoli was really tough, the leaves were okay but the bottoms were essentially inedible.  I don't know if that's just how Chinese broccoli is or what, but I don't see any advantage in serving a vegetable that can not be fully enjoyed just to appear fancy or edgy.  The pasta and cheese portion of my husband's dish were good, but not the best we've had, not even close, actually, so it's a good thing they did great with the lobster.  The complimentary bread they served was a nice treat, I really liked the olive tapenade provided on the side and my husband enjoyed the herbed butter.  And our cocktails were also great; I highly recommend their Moscow Mules!

Bottom line: we had a wonderful night and enjoyed our dinner, but next time we want to splurge on a great meal, we'll head over to Lolita or Crop.  We will absolutely be returning to Fahrenheit for Happy Hour, though!!"}
{"text":"Shame on the chef for not overseeing the staff.  This was one of the worst dining experiences we ever had.  First, our cocktail was missing the proseco (the champagne glass was 1/2 full - could have been a hint!  Then our appetizers came late, and some didn't come at all until we asked our server about them.  Then an hour after that our dinner still hadn't come.  The pizza was delivered to a different table next to ours', fingered by the staff, and finally found its way to our way to our table (unappetizing).  The dinners, when they finally came were cold.  Needless to say, we complained to management and our dinner was comped.  A $450 dinner should have been much better than this (both in taste and presentation). The restaurant lost 3 different families and all of their friends.  A total disconnect between the kitchen and patrons!!"}
{"text":"The warm weather is here, and so is a full summertime schedule of nights out with the girls.  I headed to Fahrenheit with a few of my coworkers for a celebratory dinner and let's just say, my first dining experience with Rocco did not disappoint.

To our surprise and delight, Fahrenheit offers a three course dinner special Mon-Thurs. from 5-7.  I know it's dangerously close to \"Early Bird Special\" territory, but trust me, the earlier dining time is worth it.  For $30, you get three delicious courses.  Granted, the choices are limited, but the size of the portions and the flavors are still large and in charge.

I went with the chicken spring rolls for my appetizer because I don't think you can go wrong with a deep-fried dish.  They were crispy and flavorful, and there was an amazing dipping sauce and pickled cucumber salad to accompany it.  I took the server's recommendation and tried the pork tenderloin for my entree, and let's just say, I nearly licked my plate clean because it and the sweet potato puree it was draped across was that good.  I capped off the meal by stuffing myself silly with the banana mascarpone cheesecake which was my ideal dessert -- sweet, creamy and rich.

Our server was friendly, attentive and informative.  Our white pear sangria was out of this world.  And who doesn't love Ohio City in the summer?  I think I've just found the perfect spot for all my weeknights out."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but last nights experience here was so bad I just had to. A group of us had dinner and drinks here for a special occasion, and I had travelled from NYC for it. Overpriced food, rude pretentious servers and bartenders, and slow horrible service. Avoid this place!!"}
{"text":"Would give a negative 10 stars if I could. Service is terrible. Was not given silverware, had to beg for bread and the waitress gave us attitude when we were ordering. No one there acted like they had ever worked in a restaurant in their life. The food is also below mediocre, you're really paying for the view and that's it. Both times I've gone it's just been an utter disappointment. Would not recommended this place to anyone. So overpriced for the bullshit you receive. A thousand other better restaurants to go to here in Charlotte. This place sucks !"}
{"text":"Cathy was an awesome server on point with all of our needs. The appetizers suggested were perfect and delicious. The ribeye steak was cooked to perfection and wonderful. We all really enjoyed the experience and the food. 
Have to mention again that Cathy was a awesome"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to dine at this lovely rooftop restaurant that I've been asked to go since grand opening.

I gave it  ***** STARS, the Hostess were quite friendly and delightful, walked us to our window seating  in front of the fireplace that we could see out the balcony overlooking our beautiful \"Queen City\".

We started out with some appetizers that was recommended to us, wine....it was great except the Ahi Tuna was a little bland to our taste, but the bacon wrap was good.

Then not too long, they brought us our bone in ribeye, which was just too fast to come out because we didn't even get to enjoy and finished our appetizer, we were rushed. 
Our Ribeye was cooked perfect to our liking, one of the best we've had as far as Ribeye goes.

Our dessert, we chose milkshake with whip cream...like we need it, also they surprised us with an ice cream and butter milk biscuit...quite tastey.

Overall, I'd say WE LIKED IT A LOT AND WE SHALL RETURN.

The Staff were fabulous....special thanks to our Hostess, \"Kala\"."}
{"text":"So I want to thank you Fahrenheit. Because of you and your poor customer service, and your inability to accommodate a reservation made more than 7 days ago, for party of 7, we were able to enjoy an amazing dinner at Aria. The best Italian food and all of Uptown Charlotte.. And amazingly accommodating and incredibly special. To the owner, when your service manager tells a party of 7 from a billion-dollar corporation that they cannot have a seat with a  window view area because the owner made reservations for his two parties, then clearly something is missing with the concept of the customer."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to dine at Fahrenheit for Queens Feast. I kept hearing about the views but heard food was so-so, but wanted to judge for myself. Once arriving we were seated away from the better views of the city so asked to be seated in area with better view which hostess accommodated with no issue. We decided to order off the pre fix menu, for 1st course my friend had the sticky wings which he noted were too small, and kind of dry. I went with the Fahrenheit greens which were pretty unspectacular for a house salad. It was barely dressed in the miso vinaigrette and it was mostly just lettuce with a tiny bit of  cashew. We both chose the Slow Braised Kobe beef short ribs which were so tender the meat fell apart into the broth and noodles and with the exception of being just a tad salty I thought were excellent. 
For desert we both had the bread and butter cake, it could have been a tad moister and the peach compote was barely there. I did enjoy that it was not overly sweet though and enjoyed the nut topping.

On Service and decor I was not impressed... the waitress was average but not bad, but in the beginning there seemed to be a little confusion on who our actual wait person would be. Additionally, the  cheap looking wine card on the table as well as worn furnishings and placemats really took away from the experience. I know it's picky but if you are going to pay $45 (closer to $50-60 when it's not restaraunt week) for one meal I would really expect higher standards. Overall I would say the experience was average.. it would probably be better suited for a happy hour as you are really paying for a view. I believe that among others, places like  Del Friscos, Zebra, and even Vivace (which is more reasonably priced with in my opinion better food)  provide you with the type of food and service that I would expect from the prices and hype that are associated with Fahrenheit."}
{"text":"For a restaurant where the entree prices start at $30 you would think the food would be better. Appetizers were ok (calamari) but my main course was not worth the $45 price tag. The special of the day was described as a white fish on a bed of pasta with a cream sauce. What I actually got was a bowl of mac and cheese with a dry piece of fish on top. The view is fantastic so I would recommend this as a great spot for drinks but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Go for the view... And drinks. Then grab an appetizer. And if you are hungry dinner. 

I love bringing out of town-ers here for a drink with a view. Come right before sunset to see the sky change colors and the lights from the building come on. 

I've eaten dinner here a time or two and enjoyed my meal. Servers were friendly. 

Valet is a little pricey but it is worth the view. Get your ticket punched."}
{"text":"Where is the zero star option? Hard to say a good thing about the experience we had from the moment we walked in.  Overpriced and overhyped."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by one of my buddies that lives in Charlotte. Said they had some of the best cocktails, local beer on draught,  and the best pizza in the city. Not sure what other places in the city I would compare it to, being that I was only in for a business trip, but I would venture to say it was the best pizza I have had in a long time. The fig ol fashioned off of their cocktail menu is to die for and the local beer I chose was the birdsong higher ground IPA which paired amazingly with my pepperoni pizza. Next time I'm in town I will defiantly be stopping here. If not only for the amazing view of the city then for another amazing pie!"}
{"text":"Very romantic setting and decor. 

Scotch selection is typical of most places in Northeast Ohio, I settled with the Oban 14 yr. They don't carry Dalmore 12 yr :(

The Hummus is very good, not the best I've ever had, but very tasty.

The Kobe Beef Short Rib is well worth the $30 price. The flavor is sweet and the meat is very tender. I plan on making a return trip just for this dish. 

The Chocolate Orange martini tastes like a chocolate covered gummy beer, I enjoyed it.

Also had the the Chocolate Lava Cake, very good.

Very satisfied with my experience at this place. Worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Great view when you sit out on the patio. The mussels, lobster roll, scallops and Tuscan Kale salad were delicious!  The environment is modern and the people are well dressed. Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Fahrenheit for brunch. Our server openly complained about being tired, and that the kitchen was not easy to work with. My girlfriend asked to substitute bacon for sausage, and they were unwilling to make this arrangementp. If it was part of the dish I would understand, however it was a side of sausage. The food took a little over an hour to get to us. My entree was surprisingly tasty, given the experience. 
We are both in the industry and were pretty shocked by the experience. I am happy to pay for decent food and good service but We were really made to feel like an inconvenience. The price was not worth the experience."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, terrible food. The $40 sockeye salmon and eggplant tasted like it had been soaked in salt for a week. Nearly inedible. The wine was great though, but unless you enjoy drinking salt water, avoid that salmon like the plague. I would consider coming back, but one more bad dish and a customer I will not be."}
{"text":"Best view of the city, hands down. 

Go for brunch on a Sunday. You will not be disappointed. Feel like something fun? Try the Captain Crunch pancakes (yes, you read that right). Or maybe go for some southern comfort with chicken and waffles. Whatever you choose, you can't go wrong!

The service is always excellent. Very friendly servers who are very helpful and knowledgable about the menu. 

Be sure to get the cinnamon donuts as your appetizer (because how else do you start brunch?!)."}
{"text":"Excellent service, awesome view and tasty brunch. If they expand their brunch menu and expand outdoor seating, it would be 5 star."}
{"text":"I love the drinks here and the views are unmatched. This is a must see when you come to Charlotte or even if you just want to get a little dressed up!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Fahrenheit on Friday July 5 a place I wanted to visit anyway so I finally got a chance to and I was surprised....I sat at the bar and enjoyed my new found vodka OYO Stone Fruit and pepperoni/sausage pizza which was deelish....my bartender Nicci was awesome and very pleasant.....the place is tucked away in the Tremont area....so stop by you will be impressed....I sure was."}
{"text":"I give the place 4 stars for the view. It is loud there (Tuesday night) and a little too dark. Beer was good. Menu seemed interesting so I ordered a Pizza. Just the plain Margarita style. DO NOT make that mistake. Crust was good but it stopped there.  This should have been called a garlic pizza.  Not just a taste of garlic but overwhelming!   My wife was not happy! The mozzarella was clumpy. If they are using that type of mozzarella - shred it. I'll go back, but not for pizza."}
{"text":"Be sure to check your receipt. Our waitress didn't give us an itemized receipt and put the entire bill for 7 people on the card that we had to put down to hold a table (just a drink table, not full food table) without asking if we wanted it split.  I asked for an itemized receipt and she gave us a nasty look! When she brought it, we saw a 20% tip was included and she didn't even mention it. She was absolutely trying to sneak that by us. We asked to split it 6 ways and she was again rude and said the machine couldn't do it, which was probably a lie. She shouldn't have assumed the entire tab was together from the go. She also intentionally upcharged us for one of the beverages, but we didn't even argue over a few bucks based on our experience thus far.
Be careful for sneaky people if you go! Otherwise, the drinks weren't worth the money. For a good view, go, but for good drinks, choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"Obviously, considering the chef is Chef Rocco, the expectation is excellent food. And that's guaranteed. But the service is what makes the experience. Ask for Chris Palmer as your server and you'll be guarantee a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Spectacular views & great service. I love the ambiance of Fahrenheit, but I wouldn't say the food was anything to write home about. 

Perfect location for dinner on a clear fall evening, we enjoyed a few cocktails on the patio before we were seated in a neatly-situated cozy booth in the corner, but next to the window. Our waitress was phenomenal and was helpful since most of our party consisted of first-timers. It took me a while to realize how much water we were all drinking, because our server always made sure we had plenty on the table. 
I ordered the special which was prime rib with root vegetables. Now this was an impressive piece of meat when it came out, but it was not anything special. The coffee glaze gave it good flavor and made it unique. The vegetables were also so-so. 

Our waitress recommended the banana cheesecake for dessert, which I couldn't turn down (being a lover of anything banana-flavored). It was delicious and came with a little bit of banana ice cream, but the portion was unimpressive. One person in our party ordered the chocolate mousse (or something of sorts) which was also delicious but came in a much bigger portion, which was shareable. 

Fahrenheit receives 4-stars because it has the BEST view of the Uptown Charlotte skyline, a great atmosphere, and fantastic service. I just wish their food could seal the deal. This is a Charlotte staple and I expect to bring my friends here next time they're in town for a cocktail and a view."}
{"text":"WELL, Unfortunately this is my first time ever giving a bad review of a restaurant on yelp, being in the restaurant business and my fiance being a general manager of a restaurant I know how annoying bad yelp reviews are and how they can really hurt your image but with that being said this restaurant was a total let down especially for the price of things. 

My Fiancé and I were going out to celebrate and decided to go somewhere new, we like to frequent several other high end restaurants in Charlotte and do not mind paying for good food and good service so we saw the menu and were excited to try everything. 

We arrived and everything started out smooth  beautiful view, great table, we started with a couple drinks that were very good some of the best signature drinks I have had around, then we talked to the server and asked his recommendations for appetizers. He recommended the chorizo stuffed figs which were awesome and we decided to get the Charlotte Nachos which were ok,  a very good size potion but not a ton of flavor or seasoning but overall good.

Then we got to the Entrees, we took the servers recommendations and got the Kobe short ribs and the King Crab Ramen, both letdowns.  The Kobe short ribs was supposed to be their signature dish and the ribs  themselves were very good, flavorful and tender but the broth and noodles with them were just ok and not very memorable. The major issue we had was with the King Crab Ramen, this dish is $42 which doesn't sound that bad for king crab and pork belly, but when it arrives and all the king crab that there is in the dish is maybe a  3 oz piece that is overcooked and falling apart we thought for that price we would get at least one crab leg worth of meat, the pork belly was cooked well at least but then the ramen were mushy and overcooked, maybe we got it on a bad night being a Sunday and all but way overpriced for mediocre food. 

We were planning on saying something about it to the server or manager but after we got our food no one came by to check on us until later in the meal when my fiancé put the bowl off to the side and a different server asked if we wanted it boxed up. Even at the end when our server did come by he never asked how we liked everything or if it was good.  The service overall was ok, he was knowledgeable and knew what he was doing but didn't really act like he cared.  

We did see the manager walking around but he never came by any of the tables near us until we were leaving. I know this restaurant is new but for a place this classy and expensive they should have a higher level of service and food should be higher quality."}
{"text":"Went here today for a mother's day brunch. 1st of all we had a reservation and had to wait a additional half an hour to be seated ( I understood it's a holiday) When seated we requested a window seat and the hostess replied \"these are for VIP's\" huh, all mothers should have been treated like VIP's!! So after being seated the waiter came to take our drink order and after that we didn't see that server for about a hour later. I mean for the price your paying you would expect better service. I had to drink my children's water  because again the server was a no show, and had to go to the bar to get my own drinks. So after we finish our meal we went to get dessert and the table was cleared, but they left the silverware we ate with to be used for dessert? So instead of complaining and ruining her mother's day I just went to the bar area and retrieved my own silverware. I recommend that they train their staff better and have the manger walk the floor to see if the guest are enjoying their experience. Sorry to say this will be the last time I every bring family or business clients to this establishment."}
{"text":"The service is shockingly terrible, and the food is just OK. The view is incredible, so I would recommend going there for drinks, a couple of pictures from the rooftop around sunset, and then dinner elsewhere. The hostesses are very attractive and put together, but clearly are not skilled restaurant workers. The waiter was fine when we could find him, but he certainly wasn't helped at all by the bussers or hostesses, who seemed like they had better places to be. For the money, I would recommend going almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went to Fahrenheit on a Friday last month (February 2012) for happy hour / dinner. 

Drinks: I started with Fahrenheit's take on the long island, can't remember the exact name but it was \"someone's\" tea, on the HH menu for $5. It was tasty, but just not quite there. The server mentioned he's still perfecting the recipe. I preferred the $4 (HH) Rocco red, a Malbec that apparently Chef Whalen worked with a winery in Argentina to create.

Food: 
* HH fries, minus parmesan. Good, but not standout. 
* House salad with miso dressing. Tasty.
* Vegan white bean & tofu ravioli from HH menu. This was a standout dish. It was rich, savory and delicious, served in a reduced tomato sauce with mushrooms. As I ate it, I could not stop thinking, \" I can't believe this is vegan, AND only cost me $4.\" Huge win. I will be going back for this dish as long as it's available. Will likely try a different salad to pair it with, though. 

Service: Personable, friendly and timely. 

Cool things: 
* Menu insert called \"Fahren-lite\" lists several dinner options with lower calorie counts. I'm not a huge fan of basing healthiness on calorie count alone, but it was nice to see health called out at a local restaurant. 
* Tasting menu, offered Monday-Thursday 5 p.m. to close, offers 3 selections for $30. If you're not a picky eater, this would be a great way to experience Fahrenheit on a budget.

Downside: Beer list leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hyatt and decided to go up and just get dessert and cocktails. The view was amazing, the blackberry bramble cocktails were awesome, and the salted caramel cheesecake was fabulous. It is very crowded and you will need reservations for dinner, the bar was packed but we spent about 10 minutes outside and found a table in the bar. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Writing this review as I sit in the restaurant.  The service has been terrible.  I'm here with a large group so slower service is to be expected, it's been an hour!  The waiter is a stickler who got on the birthday girl for mingling with her guests. Same waiter dropped a calamari dish on the birthday girl and a guest!  The food is mediocre and over salted. Terrible, won't be back."}
{"text":"View was beautiful from the restaurant.  Drinks was a little expensive and for the price i was disappointed it tasted watered down. Service was great"}
{"text":"My wife & I attended Fahrenheit for dinner on August 17th with a 6:30 reservation for 2.  We were looking forward to eating here, as this was going to be our second time, and it had been approximately 6 months since our initial visit.  

Upon our arrival at 6:15, we noticed there was an abundance of available seating throughout the dining areas.  There was a good mix of tables available from 2 tops to tables for 5+.  We were seated at the table to the immediate left of the hostess stand.  Once we sat down, we noticed that these seats had the air condition vent directly above, and it was blowing a very strong cold draft.  My wife and I asked to be reseated, as it was very uncomfortable, and the hostess told us that wouldn't be possible in the main dining area, and if we wanted, we could move to the bar.  This wasn't the response we were hoping for, as we made a reservation for a table, and it was quite apparent there were plenty of viable options for seating.  It was obvious she didn't want to be inconvenienced.  My wife and I didn't want to create a \"scene\" or commotion, so we said we understood and tried to move on.

Our server was Stacey, and she was kind, and tried to treat us well.  We ordered the Vietnamese Chicken Spring Rolls ($9), which were good.  Stacey gave us the recommendation to eat these like they were a lettuce wrap (lettuce provided on the side), and it definitely enhanced the taste.

We ordered our meals at the same time that we placed our appetizer order (6:30, per the receipt).  We each ordered the Kobe Beef Short Ribs ($32). We waited approximately 45 minutes for our entree to arrive (7:15). The appetizer arrived immediately, and it was shared, so it didn't take much time for us to finish.  Our frustration started to mount around 30 minutes, as we knew this was starting to take too long.  We started to compare the other tables around us and see where they were in their meals to know that we were left behind.  Although Stacey was a kind server, she did not efficiently follow-up on our meals.  We had to inquire at the 40 minute mark, and she came back to tell us our meal was \"next.\"

Once our food arrived, it was very hot, and good, but the experience of what we anticipated as being \"fine dining\" was tainted.  No apologies offered, just given a smile as we were handed our $86 bill. We also ordered dessert, but it wasn't much to write about, so I will spare you the details.

With all of the finer dining choices that are now available in Cleveland, this place needs to focus more on the finer service points than the \"celebrity chef\" name if they want to be a place that constantly brings in repeat visitors.  We looked forward to dining at Fahrenheit all week, and we left thoroughly disappointed, along with the comments that it is highly unlikely we will ever return.  After browsing some of the feedback on Yelp, I noticed that we aren't alone as far as the service issues are concerned.  Maybe Chef Rocco needs to take on a more hands-on approach to the service side before the ship starts sinking."}
{"text":"It was a lovely evening to shape with my wife from the kids 
I did the reservation before as it is too busy at Fri might we area ice about 10 min late but our reservation was still valid and they seat us immediately 
The bread and butter arrive after the appetizer the water made the thing on disorganized way. The drink I order was sprite but the taste was actually a soda water from the huge amount of ice in the glass. The food portion is great but I found that my duck was cooked med rear and still bloody so I ask him to take it away and to be recooked again, so I miss my wife as she have to eat her steak before it get cold.
It did not take long time but when the plate come back the portion of the food was less!!! I do not recommend the duck dish at all and the excuse of the waters that in the feature of my order to a duck dish I should ask for Weldon. Actually I will never order that again. Do I was not ful and had some space for the desert which was so delicious really the apple pie was great.
One more nice advantage is the valet parking with only 5$"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday in May. Excellent service and they even brought out a small dessert. The food was incredible as well as the view!"}
{"text":"I wish I had the energy to spend 30 minutes or so writing a review about this place but I don't, so I will sum it up in a few words. Food: Overpriced for what you get. Use of Butter is never a substitute for real culinary skills. Atmosphere: Great view but interior design and poor lighting distract. Needed to spend some money on quality furniture, design, and lighting. Crowd: Wants to be seen at the latest spot and could care less about the food. Chef: Who cares. Should spend more time in the kitchen and less walking around the dining floor. Staff: Not polished. Needs more experience. Overall spent $140 + on two glasses of wine, one appetizer, and two entrees. Won't be doing it again!"}
{"text":"NYC prices but not NYC quality food. Had crab cakes, short ribs and spring rolls. All okay but not great. My husband and I eat out all around the world and there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"The main reason to go here is the view. The food is decent. Its good, but not as good as other restaurants in this price range. The service is also good, but nothing that's worth writing home about. The view is incredible. The restaurant is very loud. 

If you think the view justifies the price tag (which I do, but only once), go for it. If you'd rather look at your date for the evening, go to The Asbury, Osso, Mimosa Grill, Sullivan's, or any number of other restaurants with better food and good waitstaff. 

Also, for the love of God, do not bring your loud and annoying children."}
{"text":"My husband celebrated his 35th birthday at Fahrenheit and the General Manager, Tess, took perfect care of us.  If you're looking for a hip, modern restaurant with great energy, amazing views and the most inventive cocktails in Charlotte, look no more.  

Favorite drink: Spring Fling.  
Favorite Appetizer: Charlotte Nachos.  
Favorite Entree: Kobe Beef Short Ribs.  

Cheers to Charlotte for finally getting an upscale rooftop restaurant right in the city!  We're looking forward to spending a lot of time here this spring and summer. 

*Be prepared to spend a little more $$ on food and drinks than usual.  You'll also need to catch a cab or pay for valet.*"}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant today and were completely underwhelmed. The food was ok, not bad, not great; bland tasting scallops with a slimy \"risotto\" and an extremely dry halibut were the lowest points. The pork was definitely the best dish for us.

The service was terrible, no water refills and drinks that came at different times for all of us, the waitress also forgot to bring my beer. Adding to that, the manager was extremely rude, she looked on edge from the beginning and I was really close to simply stand and leave when she told my wife that we couldn't have some traditional Chinese pastry we brought (we were celebrating Chinese thanks giving). We quickly stopped and apologized for not asking if that was allowed but the lady wouldn't let go of the issue and it wasn't until one of our friends mentioned she was a lawyer that she finally left. 

To put a cherry on top of the whole situation right before we were leaving somebody finally decided it was time to refill the water and when my friend told her it wasn't necessary she for some unknown reason got upset and left but not before giving my friend the worst possible look.

In general the staff seemed edgy and was incredibly inpatient. The worst part definitely was the manager, she needs manners. 

Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for drinks, this my second time eating here.  I had the grilled salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes.  My plate looked like they didn't need to wash it once I was done. As always the view is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was under the impression that this was an upscale restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but the service on the other hand was horrible.  It was also extrememly loud.  We were seated at a four top and could barely hear each other talk.  The server took awhile to greet us.  It seemed as though she may have had too many tables and was sat multiple tables at the same time.  We ordered a bottle of white wine and we were not offered a wine chiller.  She did not check back after the food was delivered to ask us how the food was.  When she was clearing plates, she had us hand them to her rather than walking around and picking them up.  There were tables that sat down after us that had received their dessert and check before us.  The dessert was supposed to come with ice cream and there was no ice cream to be seen.  When we questioned the server, she indicated that they ran out.  Were you going to tell us or offer us something else??  It took us over two hours for four of us to have dinner.  We are not slow eaters, but felt like we were waiting around for the server to come back to our table.  We do not feel as though she gave us adequate attention.  I expected a higher quality of service from this particular restaurant.  I have been a server before and I know that it is not easy; however, you expect the basics of serving to be demonstrated at a restaurant that strives to be in the top tier."}
{"text":"This place is special to us, so when we recently had a disappointing experience there, my husband and I were really surprised. The regular dining room is really nice- on a recent Sunday evening the only place to dine was in the open area near the kitchen. It was noisy and had terrible loud music, appealing to an entirely different crowd. If they added acoustical panels on the wall the terrible music might not be so bad, then people won't yell over each other while eating and drinking... The food is excellent, but the identity of the restaurant seems confused."}
{"text":"The atmosphere wasn't good. Very very loud and the tables weren't comfortable and too big to have a normal conversation. The first 1/2 hr there we had to yell to have a conversation. We almost left. Service was a bit slow and we couldn't hear anything she was saying. My buddy and I ordered the special dry aged New York strip, 45 min later we were told they were out.  Food was good but I don't think we'd ever go back. I was disappointed, I was really excited to eat there, but disappointed in the end."}
{"text":"This place is definitely still working out some kinks. 
The bar area is awesome - great view of the city, energetic atmosphere, and the mixed drinks are creative and tasty. I had the Spicy Charlotte and it was SO GOOD! Not to sweet and ends with a kick. For our appetizers we had the seared ahi tuna and vietnamese spring rolls. The tuna was good quality, and prepared as expected; however, the vietnamese spring rolls were not quite what I had in mind. They had curry flavoring which isn't what I would consider a traditional vietnamese spring roll - even though I was surprised, and they were incredibly spicy, they were also very good. For my dinner, I had the halibut. This dish was less than impressive. I didn't think the grapefruit/pickled fennel/arugula/potato/halibut combo was all that pleasing. I left most of my dry halibut and dry potatoes on the plate. Finally, we opted for the \"special\" for dessert which was chocolate chip donut holes; and, I ordered one of their four port options. Unfortunately, the server came back and indicated that only the most expensive one of the four ports were still available, so I opted out of that... Then, he came back and let us know that they were out of donut holes. It was a Monday night, 9:30PM, house made donut holes - gone. So, we opted out of that... The server was very apologetic, he had only been there for three weeks. However, he's not likely to stick around if he has customers trying to buy things from him, but the kitchen and bar areas aren't prepared to support their menu."}

{"text":"I went here for brunch this past Sunday and it was nothing but a disappointing experience. The food was terrible, eggs were runny and hardly cooked, the toast was soggy, avocado was put in an oven and was mushy and loaded with olive oil, and my bloody Mary was watered down and I took two sips  from. Also there was multi waitresses constantly coming over asking if anyone wanted their hardly touched food boxed up. It was disgusting and an uncomfortable experience and would never go back or recommend to anyone. I  have never written a bad review before, that's how terrible the food/service was."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great views and great vibe. We had a corporate dinner this evening and I have never seen so many sales people so silent as we all devoured our food. In fact I think everyone had experienced gastronomic orgasms- the food was that awesome! 
I had the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection  (medium rare). Most of the others had the braised short ribs and all raved about it. As well as a few had the seared scallops. We all pretty much licked our plates clean!
The staff were all equally pleasant and very accommodating.

All I can say is... Please open a location in Philadelphia!"}
{"text":"Fantastic view. Went downhill from there. Ordered drinks and wine to start. First two bottles of $50 white were out but they recommended the $65 bottle of sauv. blanc which we had. Not much choice. Nice move on their part. Oh did I mention it took 30 minutes. Food was good but took forever. Ordered espresso but couldn't drink it. It tasted like some sort of chemical . When we left, we expected some sort of apology, it never happened. Would go back for drinks and the view but not for dinner. Too bad."}
{"text":"We thought this would be a special place to take out of town guests for a Christmas celebration before they left for home.  It was a disappointment in many ways. The restaurant was freezing!  We were by the thermostat (59 degrees) and it never climbed beyond  60 degrees the whole time we were there. Also, we made reservations and our table was across from the kitchen door and by the service station.  I asked for another table but was told the others had been reserved.  What?  So we ordered drinks hoping to warm up!  The service staff was very friendly if a little hurried so the drinks were fine.  Food was ok but nothing special.  A very expensive experience and disappointing since our daughter and her friend were visiting for the holidays.  We should have dined somewhere else. 

On the positive side, we would go back and have a drink in warmer weather and enjoy the city view.  If you are looking for great food, this is not the place.  There are much better restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The bar was great and the drinks were really good. Enjoyed the view too. However, dinner was very mediocre. Our main course arrived before we were finished with our appetizer. Felt like we were being rushed. The scallops were average and $31 for 3 scallops seems a little much. My friend got the short ribs which tasted like Chinese take-out to me. Overall, I would come back for a drink, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at this Resturant. I was so excited, especially after hearing about the view. We first walked in to the bar waiting on other to arrive. The 2 bartenders were GREAT! We asked for a table around 9:50.. The hostess was apparently to busy looking at her phone at \"underwear\".. And told the guys it would be several minutes that she had to see if there were any servers still there.. (They don't close till 11 and there were still people eating) So at 10:05 I go up to the hostess still busy looking at her phone, asked about the table and she said it'll be 2-3 minutes.. So we finally get a table around 10:13. Once we all sat down the waitress Adrienne was already acting rude because we were there, and you could tell she didn't want to serve us. So when we got our food my boyfriend gave me a piece of his pizza, I took 1 bite to find the whole underneath of the pizza was BLACK! So I get the waitress she takes it to the back... I think her and ALL the cooks forgot the kitchen has a HUGE glass window so we can see them talking, pointing, throwing their arms up, rolling their eyes, and laughing. At this point were pretty upset because we NEVER once saw a manager and it was a little after 11 and the waitress brings the pizza out on a plate... So we ask for a box because why would we sit there longer...She takes the pizza back in the kitchen and everyone in the kitchen turned and looked all pissed off and rolling there eyes so did our waitress. All we wanted was a box. It was the worst experience ever! Needless to say, we will never return to this Resturant. And if you do go make sure you don't get Adrienne as a waitress she is terrible and rude."}
{"text":"Went back to try again for fathers day, after having mediocre food and service during the first visit. Good news is the food was significantly better, however, the bad news is the service was again way off. From waiting 15 minutes to be visited by a server, to being offered a dish meant for another table 3 separate times. There was an advertised Bloody Mary cart that looked great, however, no one to operate it left several tables scratching their heads. Great views, though 5 star pricing for a 2 star experience doesn't add up."}
{"text":"Although this restaurant has been around for awhile, I hadn't tried it yet and it was on my list. I really enjoyed it and our server was very friendly and funny. We had the Brussels sprouts and grilled avocado as starters. The grilled avocado was AMAZING! I am a huge Brussels sprouts fan, but want to caution that this is more like a coleslaw versus the roasted Brussels sprouts most restaurants serve. Anyway, it was different and really delicious. It had sort of an Asian flare to it and our table enjoyed it very much. 

For our mains, we had the short ribs (delicious and large portion), filet (done perfectly) and chicken (also a large portion). Definitely glad we tried this place out and look forward to going back and trying some of the other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment.  It really is a beautiful location and great views of the city.  I would go back and have drinks at the bar, but not dinner.  The music was loud even in the main dining room and Katy Perry isn't what I expect to hear over dinner.
   We were seated at a table near a door to the outside patio, everyone that worked there was coming in and out and the wind nailed us everytime. I mentioned it to the waiter they were apologetic and eventually moved us, so that was addressed.  We could still feel the cold wind everytime the door was used though.  
  We had the confit wings, which were good and the Vietnamese spring rolls which were just ok.  My husband had the bone in ribeye special.  It came sitting on a bed of olive oil, a LOT of olive oil, and was topped with some kind of tapenade, this had not been mentioned in the explanation of the dish and it was just strange. The ribeye was supposed to be medium rare but it was so under cooked it was purple, literally raw.   They took it back and it came back so overlooked he just didn't eat it.  Again, they apologized and took that and the apps off the bill.  My pork tenderloin was over cooked and the whipped sweet potatoes were not whipped at all and actually tasted watery, like they had been boiled.  The garlic on the spinach was raw, so really strong. We did enjoy the lobster tail that came with the ribeye. 
   We had other issues, but these are the highlights. I wish I could say that these were new restaurant kinks that need to be worked out, but even the food that wasn't messed up was underwealming."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Fahrenheit for our two-year anniversary to get drinks and desert.  The place was packed so I went to the bar to get our first round of drinks, I had to wait at the bar for about 15 minutes before I was finally served, two bartenders were chatting right in front of me for several minutes with neither asking if I needed anything.  I finally ordered her first drink, the \"Sweet Georgia Brown,\" and I ordered myself a Manhattan.  I could see the bartender making our drinks and could tell that he was unsure how to make them.  The description for the Sweet Georgia Brown has \"spiced and pickled peaches\" in it; all I saw him put in the drink was the whiskey and chile, the drink was overly spicy to the point where she could not drink it and I was barely able to drink it, not a pleasant cocktail.  I was also able to observe my Manhattan being made, a classic Manhattan calls for a 2:1 ratio of whiskey to vermouth, I received a 1:1 ratio, there was no cherry added and the drink was served in the smallest rocks glass I have ever seen; I was most surprised to see that my poorly made mini-Manhattan cost $15.

We then sat down at a table outside, we finished our cocktails and were waiting for a waitress to come by to take our drink and desert order.  We sat there for a while, before security noticed us and alerted a waitress to check on us.  We placed our order, a dirty Martini and the \"Copper Irishman\" to drink, along with the \"Chocolate and Coconut Pot de Creme.\"  We waited for about 15 minutes for our cocktails to be delivered, this round of cocktails was much better than the previous drinks we had ordered.  About 10 minutes later the desert came, tasty but nothing special.  Our waitress finally returned after 20 or 30 minutes to check on us, we asked for the check, and after a longer than normal amount of time brought it to us.

After paying, we gave up our table to others waiting and walked around the patio area; as poor as the service and drinks were, that did not lessen the great view of the city the place has."}
{"text":"This is probably my most favorite place to go in Charlotte. Great food and drinks.  The only problem we always have is getting service outside on the terrace. We continue to go back even though we know we will not get good service if we set on terrace.  We just keep hoping this will change."}
{"text":"Thank goodness the atmosphere was nice, because the service is terrible. No attention to details and the wine was served like we were dining at a truck stop. Had to ask for bread multiple times. Food overall was ok, but the chef was trying too hard to find unique flavors...unfortunately each side item never tasted like they belonged with each other or the entree.  Finally, we were served our dessert without the waiter clearing the entree dishes!?!?  At least it made for some interesting conversation."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! The food was delish. The braised short ribs and chocolate brownie were great."}
{"text":"Second time dining here and it was yet another great experience. I came with six of my girlfriends and had the best time. We were celebrating my friends birthday and the service and the food was great. A couple of us got the pork shank with polenta and it was fall off the bone delicious. Another friend got the salmon which was good but the portion wasn't that great from what she said. A couple of people that the short rib, another got lobster mac, and another got the special which was lamb. Everybody seem to be very pleased. They sent out the Cleveland nachos complements of the chef which was so nice! We also got a free birthday dessert of our choice, what is better than that!? All in all everything was perfect. I will say though that I am only giving him four stars because we valet and return five minutes before they where supposed to close and they were gone! We ended up having to leave our car there and call for a ride"}
{"text":"Food was great but service awful ( except the bartender who finally took pity on me and brought me my check after watching me search for my MIA server for way too long). The lobster Mac and cheese is soooo good. It's really just pasta, bathed in a very thick lobster bisque with some cheese thrown in to thicken it up -but somehow it works. Even when served cold (again, my server was MIA so never got to tell anyone it was cold). My Cesar salad was tasty too and I loved the white anchovies that were stuffed throughout. The egg that came on the salad was  overcooked for softly boiled but I was willing to overlook that.  Improve the service and you'll earn an extra star."}
{"text":"Details:  SWEATY like a night club-no place to enjoy dinner.  It was miserable to the point I couldn't order a main course.  They carded you at the door?  Hahahaha!  

Showed up at 8:00pm
Waited 30 mins past our reservation to be seated.

Sat in a table that was in the corner facing the city and apparently (according to the waitress) it is the hottest spot in the restaurant.  After sweating through my appetizer U ordered a starter salad to get enough sustenance to move on for the evening.

20% service charge on parties 4 or more...Service sucked!!!

They did put a shop vac fan near the restrooms to \"get the air moving.\"  Worst experience ever!  Where am I?  

107 degrees Fahrenheit!  Also the manager and people walking around with ear pieces (creepy) don't care you are miserable...and the elevator was a sticky puke mess!"}
{"text":"This must be how rock stars live. The view is stunning. Service was attentive, warm, and welcoming. Dress up a bit before going here. You won't want to leave."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a gorgeous view. I have no complaints. The servers were sweet, the view is pretty and you can sit outside and eat and have your drinks. I'm a New Yorker so it's hard to impress me but I can definitely say that I was. 

I didn't pay for the food so I can't speak in the prices. But the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. The food is amazing. I highly recommend the deep fried lobster tail, lobster mashed potatoes and kale salad. The wine list is really good as well. I have been here on multiple occasions and had one no so great experience. As a result, I called and spoke with a manager about it and they not only made things right, but went above and beyond to make sure that my next visit was great. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This was one of my worst experiences. First it took 20 minutes just to get our drinks. We placed our orders and never received half of it. The food we did get was greasy and bland. The next 20 minutes were us waiting for our bill. The table next to us were clearly more important because they were told about the 4 specials of the day, received their drink order promptly, and were brought a completely bread basket. 1 star is way more than this place deserves. Will not ever come back"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Fahrenheit. This place is so good that I had guys come into Cleveland for business took them there one night and the next night I asked where do you want to they said is ok if we go back to Fahrenheit.  Short Rib will change how you look at short ribs it's great. Lobster Mac might have a whole lobster or two in it."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and both times I have been underwhelmed. Everything tasted fine, but was under seasoned. Try the butter and olive spread though- they were delicious! Our cocktails were well crafted. The service was good, but that is expected in a restaurant of this quality. My husband and I find the tables to be oddly too long; we were unable to touch and it was a struggle to hear each other. I like the décor and feel of the place. What I really don't like is the air of self-importance that oozes from the menu and more specifically, the wine menu. I have dined at many fine establishments in Cleveland as well as other major cities, and I have never encountered such a snobbish wine list. It's as though Rocco Whalen thought if he only included wine that is $50 and above he will be more respected as a chef. A good sommelier will say that there are high quality wines available in the $30 range. Maybe to keep up the hype they need to charge more.  

I don't regret eating here, though I prefer Pier W for a special occasion. Cleveland has so many excellent establishments, so I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"The food is always great. We've been there couple times for dinner and finally we've tried their brunch today. Shrimp and grits are the best I've ever had. And I'm a picky eater. I've tried shrimp and grits in several places but the combination of lobster sauce and pecorino cheese made that dish #1 for me. 

Service is disappointing part of the dining experience. Servers just care about \"certain tables\", water glasses are always empty, you never feel that they care about you're being there. Well.... one thing that we've noticed servers get really nice before they bring your check. 

But... I need to say that.
The view is outstanding. And that what makes management not to care about the guest experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The seared tuna is heavenly. It's hard to get a table on a Friday night without a reservation. Luckily, they had a bar table for us so we didn't have to wait at all. The bartender serving us recommended the lamb bolognese and the seared tuna. Excellent choices. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After much hype about the restaurant in general and praise for the slow cooked Kobe short ribs and bacon at the bar, I felt it was time to make the short walk to Fahrenheit. I deliberately chose to go on a Thursday, where there wouldn't be a mad dinner rush and hopes that chef Rocco was there and in the kitchen. 

Unfortunately, I only got 1 of those. The bacon had been removed from the bar and replaced with popcorn. Chef Rocco was there, but he was not in the kitchen.

The braised short ribs were perfect. A 5 by themselves. The best short ribs I have ever eaten. The perfect caramelization and sear with the apple glaze on the beef makes my mouth water thinking about how good they were. In any other circumstance, this dish would probably be a 5 if it were served with anything other than lo-mein. 

I said dish didn't I? It was actually a bowl.  Whoever sauced my short ribs in his absence while the chef dined at the bar was either incredibly nervous or suffering from cerebral palsy. The bowl added to the problem of over-saucing, drowning the noodles in a pool of sweet and sour teriyaki sauce. How was the bok choy you ask? It tasted nothing like bok choy, but an over-steamed remnant of it's previous life as a vegetable.  The mushrooms? Awesome.

The dish is what I call the McDonald's effect. Don't be fooled by the pictures on the website http://fahrenheittremont.com/images/fahr_ss2_photos/fahr_ss_a.jpg. It does not look like this anymore. That abstract artful garnish? Not there. But, I suppose it wouldn't have saved the noodles from being overly sauced anyway. 

Would I go back? Maybe."}
{"text":"This review is based off of my recent experience when my family went here for my Mom's birthday. My family has eaten here before and previously had good experiences, so I was especially disappointed that we had so many issues with both the service and the food. 

It was the little things that made the night go poorly, starting with our table not being ready at our reservation time. Not a huge deal. We ordered some cocktails at the bar and it was only a ten minute wait. We paid for our cocktails and moved to our table, at which point a waiter presented us with a bill for our bar tab, which we had to tell him we'd already paid. He had to go back and consult with the bartender who confirmed that we had in fact already paid. Again, not a huge deal, but the little things like that really started to add up and made the overall experience really uncomfortable. 

Speaking of uncomfortable, the seating at our table was extremely odd. There were three chairs and a bench on one side. Behind the bench was the kitchen and server's area. Every time someone walked by (which was continuously since the kitchen was right there) the entire bench shook. I was able to move to a chair, but the couple at the table next to us (which shared the same long bench) weren't so lucky. Their two person table didn't have room for chairs, just that one bench. So the two of them were forced to squeeze next to each other on a shaking bench. I can only imagine how awkward that would have been had they not been a couple! 

So the thing with being right next to an open kitchen is you get to hear and see the whole operations. That would have been really cool had it been going well, but when it's obvious that the whole staff is stressed and there are a lot of errors, it doesn't exactly make for a fun experience. 

The service was extremely slow and didn't at all match what you would expect from such a nice restaurant. Nearly all the food was sent out by runners quickly dropping the food off at our table and not by our actual waitress, which led to a lot of problems. We all ordered appetizers. My mom and I both got ours around the same time, but we had to ask for my stepdad's. When his finally came out, it was completely cold (we both ordered the same black truffle meatballs and mine was fine). 

I ordered the filet, which was itself delicious. But the side of broccolini was so salty it was basically inedible and my stepdad's short ribs were also extremely salty. Pretty disappointing for the price of the food. My mom loved her lobster mac and cheese. 

They messed up our bill twice. The first time was Pellegrino they'd forgotten to remove (I'd canceled the order after the waitress told me they only had full-sized bottles and not individual glasses or small bottles). Understandable. But then she dropped of the bill the second time without waiting for us to check and make sure it was right ... it was another table's bill. We had to flag her down to get it fixed a second time. 

Overall, it was just a really disappointing, uncomfortable experience and not what I would have hoped for my mom's birthday. Although my family has had good experiences in the past, we probably won't risk returning."}
{"text":"Great views of downtown Charlotte. Tasty steamed buns and thoughtful craft cocktails. If you're ok with being surrounded by older, rich folks this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I won't criticize too much for it. The presentation is good with the first impression (like the view, I won't argue with that). But some of the food is \"eh\" and it's a bit too pricey for what it should be."}
{"text":"Rude waitress, I have never been spoken to by a waitress like I had happen to me here. We were a group of four out for a friend's birthday. It started by her calling a man in our group rude. She mocked our table calling us toddlers because a fork was accidentally dropped. The service was very slow as well. I called after I left( I was in shock at the time) and spoke with the manager who offered a gift card that I turned down because I will not ever return. The chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates were delicious, but not enough so to take the bad taste my experience here left behind."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner here tonight. The staff was so wonderful and changed our table as I was cold. Heather (our waiter) was phenomenal l. Perfect pacing. We were on a date night and birthday celebration and Heather set us up so perfectly. Recommend this highly."}
{"text":"Overrated and over priced food from a very egotistical Chef. Ridiculously priced!
Expectations were high and were not met. Dante's should have been my destination of choice and it will be next time."}
{"text":"Down here from NYC for a family gathering, a family member who lives here picked this spot.  Against my better judgment, we obliged and went here.  So many small things added up to a disappointing experience.

As a party of 7, we were seated in a back section of the restaurant, under the air conditioning vent, by the service station and near the service doors.  A/C was freezing, and we requested to be moved to another large setup, as the room was basically empty.  We were told they couldnt turn the air down, nor move our party.  Ok, fair enough, although i dont particularly care to have staff hauling garbage and recycling by me all evening.

We attempted to order four different bottles of wine, all four of which were not available.  Odd, but ok, fair enough.  Perhaps you should update your wine list.

The real problem i had came down to food and service.  The food was average.  The calamari was greasy, my snapper was very tough.  My wife's scallops were cooked properly but presentation was unimaginitive.  The short rib was decent but unremarkable for the cost.  The best part of my dinner was the coconut base for the fish.  Thank god for small miracles, i suppose.

The service was at times aloof, unprofessional and lazy.  Bottles of wine took ages to arrive.  At one point our server rested his forearm across the back of my chair for several minutes, while i was seated, while answering questions about the menu.  Manhandled water glasses while refilling, clearing plates before people were finished eating; all basic things one should not do.  Not sure who trains waitstaff here, but a refresher course is in order."}
{"text":"OK,  THere has been a lot of press about this place, good and bad. We had some out of towners and thought it might be fun to give it a try. The service was better than the reviews tell you, but the reservationist is snooty.  The food was better than the reviews tell you. The portions are larger than you would expect, so order carefully. The appetizers are better than the main courses. There is very little outdoor seating, it is more of a walk out take a look, maybe have a drink then go back inside and eat. Nothing wrong with that, just don't expect to eat outside. The view is of course what makes it and inside has a great view. The one thing that was surprising at the price point was the cowd. There were a couple of very drunk girls bumming cigarettes in the lobby. That was a throwback, people who smoke? The entire crowd was just a little rough, like they weren't going to leave a very big tip. It just wasn't what and who you would expect. Would I go back? Sure, the food was good, not outstanding, but way better than decent. I am not afraid of a rough crowd, but I wouldn't take a client there. All in all, better than I expected, but not as sleek and special as their hype."}
{"text":"We were extremely disappointed with Fahrenheit. We went on a Sunday night during Restaurant week. Our food was extremely salty or extremely sweet - my appetizer (sausage, gravy & biscuits) was simply doused in salt which completely ruined the taste and meal, and my entree (chicken with mashed sweet potatoes) was absolutely covered in caramel sauce. We waited for our check for over 20 minutes- I think they forgot about us, we had to remind them that we were still there & needed to pay. Before we had dinner, we had a few drinks on the outside patio - that was great. I would go back for drinks but definitely not for the food. I was really really disappointed in the quality of the food. I'm surprised at the astounding prices for the low quality."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype about this restaurant, so decided to give it a try for a work-related event. The views did not disappoint! Amazing and great for pictures. The food was also really good - all freshly made and everything we tried was super yummy.

Now come the bad parts. There were multiple parties going on the evening we went, and areas were roped off. This made it near impossible to wait at the bar while and have a drink while we were waiting for our co-workers to arrive. Drinks are VERY expensive. We couldn't sit anywhere (it was all roped off) and told to go sit at a few tables near the door. So we did that, only to be kicked out of the table by a waitress who was visibly angry that we weren't ordering food there and had another table reserved in the dining room. When our full party arrived, we were then ushered to our reserved table. It was tough to see the view, and I asked to sit at numerous other unoccupied tables. We were told they were saved for \"VIPs\" and that a food blogger was coming. So, I guess we really weren't that important? Overall, we were treated like we weren't important guests. Nevermind the fact that we were going to spend some good $$ there. If it wasn't for the food and the view, I'd be giving this place zero stars. Will def not be going again."}
{"text":"Took some friends from out of town here for a happy hour and sat in the bar area for cocktails and to enjoy the view.  Ambiance is great, service was a little slow but the cocktails were great! I enjoyed the chocolate old fashion which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is one of our favorite restaurants.  The food and service have been excellent each time we have gone.  We went with another couple on Saturday night.  We had reservations and were seated immediately.  For appetizers, we ordered the meatballs, dates and mussels.  All were delicious.  They offered three dinner specials, and I wanted all of them because they sounded so good.  I ended up getting the special fish fry which was very delicious.  My husband got the short ribs, which are always excellent.  Our friends got the fish fry and a soup and salad special and were very pleased.  The service was outstanding and it was an overall great experience.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Hmmm...how to put this delicately.  Wanted to love it, but just didn't.  Second time dining here and both times underwhelmed. 

Yes, the view is one of the best in the city, but dammit, how hard is it to prepare a limited menu? There are eight signature entries, 10 small plates/appetizers, limited pizza and salads.  That's it, which is fine, after all, I do like a small menu as long as it delivers on flavor and originality.

Started with the grilled avocado with goat cheese crostini and tempura rock shrimp. I order a lot of food.  I like to dabble and taste many things.  These two items were standard fare and prepared correctly. They tasted good but no artistry here.  That's ok, consistent food is a good thing, right?

For my main, I had the filet mignon (medium), with smashed grilled potatoes, tomatoes, smoked corn and creme fresh. Oh, what a disappointment.  Filet was tough, I actually had to use my steak knife on it to cut it.  Not used to that.  The potatoes were sliced (not smashed) and grilled with no seasonings, oil or flavoring other than a dusting of parmesan cheese.  In other words, flavorless. I mean, it's a potato and there are so many great things to do with it to make it taste great. The corn was good as were the tomatoes. No complaints. The creme fresh was just sour cream. Again, no original flavor.  Had the filet been melt-in-my-mouth perhaps the sides wouldn't have disappointed me so much, but as it stands, I wasn't pleased. A $45 filet should taste great.

My previous meal was a private function and all I remember was feeling...Eh...the foods OK.  Certainly, not worth the price. I suppose I am paying for the view.  Just come prepared knowing that and you won't be as disappointed."}
{"text":"Never disappointed.  I'm a frequent flyer here, and there is nothing on the Menu that you can go wrong with.   The Cleveland Cheesesteak is amaze balls. It's so simple yet so good.  And don't forget about the Cleveland Nachos a must to try.   But the Kobe Beef Short Ribs is what that menu is all about.  Props to Koza for what he does in the kitchen there and Trevor and Nikki make the best cocktails around even if it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"Went up there for brunch last Sunday with friends and sat on the patio. Ken was our server and was on point the whole ride! Food and cocktails were amazing. All around great experience. Tip.... ask for ken"}
{"text":"Overall experience was a pricey one.... If you are going for the food, don't bother, if you are going for the experience, the view and have plenty of money....its worth a visit!

We start arted at the bar while waiting for our table and the bartender was more than happy to create a martini for me.... Basil lemon and it was delicious!

The food.... Well we shared the duck egg rolls and they were the best of everything we ordered.... Lots of duck, tender and flavorful in a light crispy skin!  We also shared the Brussels sprouts which were flavorful as well, but don't think I'd order those again.  My entree was the lobster Mac and cheese and I've had better.  It was not the cheese combo, which is different than normal, that I didn't care for, it was the lobster which made the whole dish taste fishy and I don't care for that.  Fresh lobster is usually not fishy.... Don't know what the deal was with that.

All in all we had a good time, enjoyed the view, the drinks and the appetizer, but wouldn't rush back.... What do they say.... \"been there done that\"."}
{"text":"Chef Whalen has an incredible offering.  Had the filet with a mushroom sauce.  The pork chop was excellent, too"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in the Greater Cleveland area. Clean and professional atmosphere. The staff was top notch. The food was phenomenal. My wife had the filet mignon and I had the short ribs. You can't go wrong with either. The desserts were great as well. This is going to be my new go to place."}
{"text":"Went last night for restaurant week. Drinks are extremely over priced. All reservations were all conveniently 30 minutes delayed. The food was mediocre. Calamari had too much breading. Steak was not cooked properly and didn't have much flavor. All 4 of us will not go back. Only reason they even get 1 star is because of the view from our table."}
{"text":"Go to this place for the view!!!

Fahrenheit is located on the 16th floor of the Hyatt The area is pretty posh (do people even use that word nowadays??) looking with a large bar, dim lit area, comfy seating, and large windows to take in the view. 

I have never eaten any food at this place and usually hit up Fahrenheit as a pre-dinner drink spot. This Saturday, we came as part of a Bachelorette party. The place was slammed and half was roped off due to a private event. If you are hoping to eat here, I would encourage a reservation.

We decided to grab a drink before heading outside on the terrace. I ordered the Khaleesi. Yes, 99% of the reason I ordered this drink was because it was called Khaleesi and she is a bad ass.  Anyways, this drink was very good and very strong. Great flavors and one was definitely enough! I thought the mixed drink prices were a bit high. Some creeping into the $15+ range. 

We wandered outside and took in the amazing view of the city. There are tables and seats outside but the place was so busy that it was standing room only. We were definitely not the only bachelorette party who had the same idea of coming here! There were fire pits set up and running and it was nice just to stand against the railing and look out upon the city. Excellent first stop of our evening!"}
{"text":"Ate here about a month ago and forgot to review it. Just know off the bat that you're paying for the view. The food is good, the view is great. An awesome place to have cocktails. I wouldn't go back for the food/prices, but our hostess and waitress were fun. A better first experience than we expected, though! Definitely worth trying at least once. Form your own opinion from there."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful view of Charlotte from the 21st floor and delicious food. Menu was creative and featured many locally sourced ingredients. We had our Easter brunch/lunch at Fahrenheit and were pleased with our meals (see pics). I will say the only thing I would throw a \"caution flag\" on was the price. It was quite expensive to say the least, particularly for lunch. It was 80 bucks for 2 entrees (one of which was a salad with salmon), 1 coffee and 1 mimosa. Just know this before going to avoid sticker shock. Other than that, fantastic service, delicious food and a nice ambiance. Oh, and did I say beautiful view???"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour (because BACON) last Friday before the Tribe game. Walked up around 4:50--the front door was propped open, so we went inside. 

The handful of employees at the host station didn't stop their conversation to say anything to us, so we just made our way to the bar area.

After a few minutes of more employees walking by us and completely failing to acknowledge our existence, I called over to the host station and asked if it was okay that we were sitting there. One responded that they opened at 5 and would be having an employee shift meeting first.

...it was 458 at that point, and this shift meeting had not yet begun. Several employees were grabbing food before their shift and eating it in the dining area.

At 5:00, the manager (?) walked over and began speaking with them--I assume for the shift meeting.

At 5:05, we left, having never been acknowledged by a single one of the 10-15 employees in the restaurant who walked by us multiple times.

I understand we got there early (we assumed that door propped open = open for business), I understand giving your employees some food before the start of a long Friday night, and I understand the idea of a shift meeting. I don't understand why someone would decide to start that meeting AT 5:00 if the restaurant is supposed to OPEN at 5:00.

I was so let down by what I felt to be incomparably bad service that I can't rate this experience any higher than 1 star. We walked to Lolita instead and had a stellar experience."}
{"text":"Dined at Fahrenheit tonight for the first time to celebrate my birthday. We dined with a party of 6 and made a reservation in advance. Took about 30 minutes to be seated ( after our reservation time). Server was friendly, however showed a very short attention span and very little sense of urgency. I ordered the Diver Scallops and my wife the Short Ribs; both of which were phenomenal.

A friend of mine went to notify another server that it was my birthday. He responded I'm not your server so talk to yours . I've never received this type of rude service, especially from such a high-end establishment.

Dine here for amazing food, however be prepared for deplorable service."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because of a writ in the Plain Dealer that gave it 4 Stars(exceptional). It highest rating. They had Halibut on the menu so we asked if it was Alaskan Halibut. The waiter did not know and had to ask. We ordered the special of Short Ribs and Shrimp.  The dish came out with grilled shrimp cold. The Halibut dish was over cooked and their Famous short ribs and noodles was way to salty. Service and food was at best mediocre."}
{"text":"Terribly overpriced for what you get. They charged $13 for a well Martini, which is insane for Charlotte. You can get a signature cocktail at any good bar for that. The food itself is good, it's just equally overpriced. I'm all for great gourmet food, but there are so many better options for this amount of money."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars if it was only good that I was reviewing. I had absolutely no complaints about food. It was one of the best. We tried the \"soup of the day\" which was a crab bisque and it was out of this world. So was the pork shank, beautifully done and served over polenta. 
My issue was with the service. I had made reservations ahead of time, and was greeted very coldly. It was as if the person didn't want us there. To add to it, she was trying to place us between 2 large groups and on a table that looked like an after thought, although most of the place was empty. Then it took a long time for someone to come and take order. It was one good server who was managing all the tables with others just moving around doing nothing. Only when she realized that we haven't been attended to, that she came over and took our orders. 
So, all in all, a place with really good food, but patchy service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food in Cleveland. The staff is incredible every single time. And the food is just beyond words. Definitely a higher end restaurant, with fabulous foods and drink choices. Rocco the owner is always around to greet every patron that steps in the door and the hostesses and servers are always so accommodating. Easily my favorite restaurant whatever anyone else has said on yelp about fahrenheit trust me when I say you will never regret your trip to fahrenheit, in fact you will probably be dying to come back."}
{"text":"The afternoon started off good. We grabbed a table in the bar area and enjoyed the view and nice 70 degree weather. Ordered some drinks and 2 appetizers. Drinks came, a beer and a cocktail. I had the 2nd Ward and it was yummy. Then we received the appetizers, which were yummy as well. Had the Charlotte Nachos and Sweet Potato Biscuits. The nachos were actually spiraled potato chips with cheese and scallions on top. They were good and so were the Biscuits. 

Now is where the issues started. The service was great up until this point. There were plenty of people walking around and asking if we needed anything. Then when we wanted to order our last drinks, we could not find anyone to ask for another drink. About 10 mins went by and we were finally able to catch another server and ask her for drinks. She promptly brought them to us and we asked for the bill at that time. We gave her the card and she brought it back and that is when we noticed that we were only charged for one round of drinks, instead of the 2 we had. I brought it to the server's attention, as Karma is a Biotch and I don't need anything like that, so she took the bill and went to add the drinks we had. She brings the check back and it is still wrong because she didn't put the right drinks on there. By that time, we were just ready to leave so we just paid and left. 

The bar area seems to have a lot of confusion and I think it would be great if a specific server was dedicated to certain tables and not let it be a free-for-all with numerous people asking how things are going. 

Also, I think this place is WAY Over-priced. For 2 liquor drinks, 2 beers, and 2 apps, the total bill was over $80. 

The view is beautiful, but not worth the price you pay. I'm glad I was there only for drinks and apps and not dinner as I would have been even more upset with some of the prices I saw on their entrees."}
{"text":"Locate on 21 floor of Hyatt Place in downtown Charlotte, This restaurant has a very nice rooftop bar with a nice view of Charlotte skyline. The bar has good cocktails. For food, I like Korean chicken wings and pad Thai."}
{"text":"Definitely did not enjoy my experience there. The food is subpar at the most. We did the 3 course meal for restaurant week. I was unhappy to pay the discounted price for what I got, I can't imagine if It were full price. The calamari was pretty good, nothing to jump up and down about. The filet I got was horrible. And I've had better cheese cake from the grocery store. Definitely will not return, they need to stop serving food and make it a rooftop bar only."}
{"text":"Having recently located to Charlotte from Los Angeles, I'm going through restaurant withdrawal. Not that there aren't good joints here, of course, but compared with LA's crazily inventive and always-dynamic scene, Charlotte's been a bit of an adjustment. That's why I'm glad that Fahrenheit's on the scene. It's out there taking some chances - bringing some Asian elements here, dashing in some Southern style cooking there, but pulling it off with some well-executed flair that hitherto hadn't quite made it to the Queen City. Service is pretty solid for a restaurant of its newness and size and, frankly,  it's leaps and bounds over most other places I've been during my five months here in town. Food standouts here include the inventive cocktail list (very few joints here in town are similarly daring); the ramen (I mean, it's probably the only place to get that outside of Musashi, and the view at Fahrenheit is better than the Ballantyne strip mall that place occupies); the sashimi appetizer; the pork tenderloin; the all-day braised bacon and grits; and the short ribs. I give it a solid four stars and an additional fifth for the potential that I see.

Oh, and one other thing - step up your game, Charlotte. This is a nice new place with a great view. Don't show up in your cargo jorts and flip-flops. Have some pride."}
{"text":"Great food, great food and drink happy hour specials, and quick/friendly bartenders.

I was on a work trip so dined alone at the bar - sometimes you get ignored when dining as a single lady, but not so here. 

I had a cheapo glass of wine (happy hour) and had the salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes. I had expected the wasabi taters to be only a hint of wasabi, but they were full-on wasabi green!  Surely, the wasabi purists would point out that they were most definitely made with wasabi powder rather than the real thing, but the flavor was amazing.  Balanced with the sweetness of the salmon, as well as the pickle and even some greens (I thought why the hell would you put greens in this dish, but it worked!)

I also took a dessert to go - chocolate creme de pot, which was pretty good. I'm not a huge dessert person and had been really looking for a few bites of something sweet. I would have preferred it to be more of a darker chocolate, so I found it to be a bit too sweet for my tastes."}
{"text":"Amazing service and atmosphere.  The filet was perfect.  My wife had the pork chop and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The view of uptown Charlotte adds to the experience.  We loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent place in Uptown Charlotte.  I was really expecting it to be mediocre food that attracts people with the stellar view of the city but I was wrong.  The drinks and food were both outstanding.  

Our server, Theresa pointed us in the right direction with regard to menu choices.  After a few apps (all were solid but none good enough to be highlighted in my review) we ordered our main courses and I chose the Pork Chop which was delicious!  It was supposed to include Blue Crab Fried Rice - which was also very good but couldn't locate any Blue Crab flavor at all, but I enjoyed it regardless. 

Fahrenheit is a wonderful spot especially if you want to impress out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Disappointed by the overall experience given the price. Our waitress wanted to turn the table over quickly and the food was just ok. Our waitress charged my card twice and now am in a dispute with Bank of America because I don't have the original receipt and the two charges are for two separate amounts, making it more difficult to dispute since I don't have the original receipt. Not sure how this was overlooked and not addressed."}
{"text":"The view and the service were the best I have had in a long time. Really knowledgeable and attentive waiters. My favorite part of the experience were the appetizers. You need to get the dates with chorizo and bacon, it was so amazing. I am a pizza hunter so we had pizza as appetizer and it was so fresh and delicious. I want to try all the pizzas! The nachos are delicious and very good to share with a big table (although you may not want to share with more than 4 people because you will want it all for you). The dishes were good although I wish I would have ordered a meat dish and not fish. I had the ahi tuna and it was not so flavorful. Everybody else had the salmon which I tried and thought was good. If you want to stay low budget and you still want the experience I would recommend to go and get appetizers and enjoy the view. I was full after all those amazing appetizers that we had but I thought it was totally worth the calories. Maybe next time I don't get any appetizers and give their meat plates a try. I cannot wait to try their Cleveland restaurant!"}
{"text":"The view is the best part about this resturant. Some of the appetizer are really good as well but the menu is limited"}
{"text":"It's a great location and great atmosphere once you get past the rude lobby host. Then you hit the servers upstairs that act like it's a waste of time to bring you a drink. Definitely not a place to bring a date or clients. Go with your buddies and be prepared to be treated bad so you can have a good time giving it back to them."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what  all the others were referring to. But this an amazing place. .. good food, good service,  good people (thank you Keyla). I come here frequently and the service is consistently amazing.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal. The hanger steak is really good !! Outstanding service by our waiter Andrew. He knew the menu; offered his advice on an excellent wine; and his service was superb. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We hosted a rehearsal dinner last weekend in their private dining room. The only better than the food was the spectacular service. Waitstaff did everything and all things to make our guests feel welcome. The food was excellent, expertly cooked and presented. The only complaint was that wine was charged by the glass rather than the bottle which struck me as strange with an open bar with beer and wine."}
{"text":"Other than the obvious  VIEWS , this place is pretty amazing. 
Their pretzel rolls before dinner are absolutely divine. I could eat those all day every day. 
I got a Gin fruity drink and it came in an adorable tiki glass. Didn't fit the restaurant but it was a cute surprise! 
Bottles of wine are reasonably priced, some as low as $36. 
The menu has a good variety. My favorite - salmon - is cookies to perfection with a super yummy glaze on top. 
Management wasn't the most personable but they weren't badddd either. Wasn't impressed with them either way."}
{"text":"AAAUGUGAAAHHH! (That's code for \"I hate going out on New Year's Eve!\")

My husband and I decided to do the NYE meal at Fahrenheit.  This included 5 courses, and a glass of champagne, for $60/person.  I don't know if this was the perfect choice, but it was very good.  We love this restaurant.  The food is great.  It's walking distance from our apartment.  But maybe we should have just made dinner at home because we are both easily annoyed at crowds and the general hoopla that is New Year's Eve.  If I could, I would give this night 3.5 stars.

We chose the 6 pm seating because we're old and lame.  We were seated right away...in the worst possible table in the restaurant.  I know this can't be helped, but it was one of those tall tables scrunched up thisclose to another one.  The party in the adjacent table was already seated and I had about an inch of room to squeeze in without disturbing her.  Plus, we were right up against a (deep maroon colored) wall. Talk about claustrophobia.  I don't know about you, but I like to be comfortable when I eat.  It's just part of the experience.  Adding to the madness was a group seated nearby whose group had ALL \"loud talkers.\"  You know how every restaurant has this ONE loud talker?  And sometimes each group has one?  Well this group had all the loud talkers in the restaurant put together.  Not the restaurant's fault, certainly!  But you can see how the cacophony detracted a bit from the experience tonight.

The waiter was good, and did everything quickly, but the service was kind of cold in general.  We tried the tuna tartar (my first time with this dish and I was VERY pleased) and the kobe beef short ribs.  Yum.  The second course (salad for me and lobster bisque for him) came out before we were through with the first course.  I majorly hate that.  I also majorly hated my salad, which had fried goat cheese (a high point) and sour cherry tapenade (making my mouth pucker unpleasantly when I think about it).  The greens were not dressed in the least, and the tapenade did not serve well as a dressing.  Failure.  The bisque was delicious, but my husband was full by the time he was done with that.

The third course brought me back up the roller coaster.  I had the lobster mac & cheese.  Ridiculously awesome.  My heart was beating extremely fast when I finished.   So rich.  And yes, I ate it all. 

We were almost going to tell our waiter to save himself the trouble of bringing the last two courses out (dessert and cheese), but that was too embarrassing.  So we ate what we could.  It was like Man vs. Food in there.  Even I couldn't finish anything else.  Our waiter offered us a box for the cheese plate (which, in addition to 5 different cheeses & crackers, featured berries, almonds, and some other jam-looking concoction).

As usual, the drinks were stupidly extravagant, but majorly alcoholic and good.  My husband had the Merry Mojito and the Light & Stormy (some light rum, ginger beer, and lime).  I had my usual standby, the InZinerator Zinfandel.

We rolled out of there stuffed to the brim.  Looking at our watches, we realized we had spent over 2 hours there, but it still seemed a bit rushed to me for 5 courses.  I don't know.  They had to get ready for another seating at 9:30, which I get.  I just think it might have worked a little bit in their favor if there was more time in between courses so we could digest a little bit...maybe drink a little more...etc.

I won't hold it against them too much, because this was the only time I have been less than satisfied with Fahrenheit.  I think it was just the nature of the holiday that had things a little outta sorts."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Kobe short ribs on the soft light buns- delicious!! Dates, wrapped and stuffed- scrumptious!!! Excellent service and atmosphere. Plus the outdoor fire pit area and view is perfect for a nice romantic spot or photo. Had the vodka mule and it was perfectly mixed and had an edible candied orange dipped in chocolate. Oh my my my. Yes please!"}
{"text":"FREE BACON! During Happy Hour at the Bar!

I had a drink at the bar before my party arrived to sit in the dining room and how can you not indulge in the FREE bacon that they offer?! They have delicious drinks during happy hour- I usually order the Red Sangria. 

We had a wonderful waitress who explained all the meals and answered all of our thousands of questions. For an appetizer I ordered the Thai Style Spicy Chicken Meatballs. They were good but nothing out of the ordinary. For my main entree I ordered the Roasted Walleye and it was delicious! I finished every last bite!

Happy Hour is from 5-7pm M-F and offers $4 Wine & Sangria, $5 cocktails and $4 Beers."}
{"text":"Best brunch ever!

Came in on a Sunday morning. Started with a made to order bloody Mary. Phenominal. Spicy, with shrimp, pickles, onions, olives, lemon, lime and a carrot stick. 

Felt good with the bloody as I ordered some healthy omelette thing. Made from egg whites, had chicken sausage, tomato, spinach and a few other delicacies. Came with oven grilled asparagus, I could just feel my arteries opening up. 

Across the table from me on the dark side, my wife and daughter had the Captain Crunch pancakes with vanilla drizzle and a half pound of bacon each!  They were very, very good. 

Service was quick and friendly. Nice little joint."}
{"text":"I have to say, this place has a great atmosphere (obviously you have a direct view of uptown Charlotte and it's great for photos), but WOW the staff was stuck up and RUDE. We went for birthday and had a reservation at 4 PM. Half of the party (including myself) arrived at 4:05 and the rest ran late and didn't arrive until 4:25. I asked the hostess if this was ok and she said \"that's fine but just so you know we have a 2 hour limit for tables, so just make sure you're finished by 6:15\".... I have NEVER been told that my table had a \"time limit\" on it. That's absurd. We all joked about this during the entire dinner. Our waiter was just as rude as the hostess. He wouldn't accommodate my friend who is a vegan by taking the cheese off her pizza, and i asked him about splitting checks and he basically said he was too lazy to do it. Unreal. Additionally,  the other waitresses laughed and turned their noses up at my friend who was slightly underdressed for the occasion. I've never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant in my life. I probably will not go back after this experience. But, i will say that the food delicious and came out quickly."}
{"text":"A great place for a nice drink and en even nicer view. I visited Fahrenheit with a group of friends this Spring. It was the perfect meeting spot since it overlooked a city I have never been to. The bar had a great selection of local beers and I enjoyed said beer until the fire alarm went off.

Yes, there was a fire alarm going off while I was at a restaurant called Fahrenheit and no, this wasn't a theme.  We had to walk down about 24 flights of stairs with our drinks in our hands only to find out it was a false alarm. Great cardio workout but not a great way to enjoy a drink. 

Was expecting a free drink on the house for the hassle, but not even so much as an apology. Oh well.

Best bet: Go here for a nice date night or a fancy dinner. Enjoy a drink before your meal outside. They have a nice set up that makes it feel comfortable indoors or out."}
{"text":"I'm going to do something crazy and say that the meal I had here was one of the best of my life. I wasn't really sure what to expect, so I was definitely pleased to find that everything was amazing! 

We came here for our 4 year anniversary on a Tuesday, so it wasn't too packed, though we did see some characters out and about (more on this below). This was definitely a nice little splurge-discovery that will stick with me. My fiancé has been cutting back (and by cutting back, I mean eliminating) carbs for health reasons, so finding a restaurant that is acceptable is a little difficult (when the rules are made for health reasons, they're hard to bend). We scored with Fahrenheit! 

I was starving, so the menu was entirely too tantalizing. Our server was very enthusiastic and willing to help, though. I was torn between the seared scallops and seared rare tuna; both of these dishes had potential to be amazing, but I was so stuck! I went with the tuna and it was the best decision I could have made. The tuna itself was prepared perfectly. So juicy and rare! (The fiancé is unfortunately allergic, though he loves tuna, so I was a little indulgent and selfishly ordered and ate this in front of him--totally worth it.) The green curry cilantro sauce that came on the dish was perfect and not too overpowering, so I could still swirl some meat around in it and get the flavor of the tuna as well. Tomato edamame fried rice was a perfect pairing with this dish; light and flavorful, but nothing to overshadow the star of the meal. Even my leftovers were fantastic (though I ate almost all of the dish out of delicious gluttony)! 

My companion got the short ribs...I think. I couldn't try it since he couldn't try mine. Fair is fair! 

Anyways, this was the most amazing meal and I think it was because of its simplicity in flavor, but it was perfectly prepared. I have to say, upon returning, I'll probably have trouble ordering something else since that tuna steak was so dreamy! 

The blueberry something or other martini cocktail that I had was just ok. Probably not my best decision of the night, since it wasn't tasty and I lost interest when my food came. 

The atmosphere was a little...irritating, but that had nothing to do with the restaurant itself. It was mostly the other diners that were creating an issue. There were a couple of ladies sitting down a way from us and they kept using their super iphone flashlight apps to look at EVERYTHING. This was a problem because they would flip pages over or maneuver the phones with the flashlights ON and blind us on the other end of the row. The other issue had to do with a table of men that seemed to be trying to relive their glory days in college. They all appeared to be married except for one (we were embellishing some life stories at this point) and they were relishing in his stories of escapades and scandal (for all we know, he may not have been the lone unmarried guest...). Anyways, that was annoying, but we had some fun with it. We heard pretty much every bit of their conversation, so we had to try to make the best of it. 

So, in conclusion: EAT HERE, IGNORE THE OTHERS AS BEST YOU CAN!"}
{"text":"Read all the other reviews. Your odds of having a good experience is 50/50 at best. Let's face it, the only reason people go here is for the view. Fine. Have a drink, go outside and enjoy. But if it's fine dining you're after, you will not get it here. I think our waiter literally had no idea what he was supposed to do. He fumbled through the entire meal; he had no personality, and he didn't really seem to care. It's like we were imposing on his time the entire night. At the end, he brought us the dessert menu, left, and came back with the check. WTF? He didn't even ask us if we wanted anything. 

My wife and I had fish and my daughter ordered the pizza. The fish was terrible; it smelled bad, the flavors didn't blend at all, and midway through the meal we were both eating my daughters pizza. 

I know you won't believe me. So go ahead and try this place, enjoy the view, but get the pizza; it's the only safe bet. Or, save the $50 per person bill, and go to Pikes 5 times. They'll appreciate your business and treat you better."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I went here because I had a four hour lay over in Charlotte. They did not open until 4:00 PM so I had to wait in the lobby. Britney was my waitress. She was just okay. She didn't do anything spectacular and I normally like for my waiter to be more personable. I didn't know anything about her and she didn't ask any questions about me. 

 I will say that the customers here were really nice. I enjoyed the clientele here more than I enjoyed the staff. Everybody wanted to get a good picture because of the view.

Luckily I was here during restaurant week and I got a chance to enjoy what was on the menu. The food was very good I must admit. Looking at the previous comments I saw that it was pretty expensive for the food but I enjoyed the choices for restaurant week."}
{"text":"We came here in party of 8 for our friend's birthday. We made reservations but we weren't seated because we have to have full party in order to be seated at our reserved table. Great drinks, but I did not enjoy my meal. I ordered Creekstone korean BBQ ramen. The broth had no flavor, all I could taste was reduced wine from the broth and the flavors from the kimchi and the meat and the broth combined wasn't that great. It says it's carmelized kimchi but I know it's not since I am korean. Service was so-so."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is amazing!  The food is wonderful but the view can't be beat!  Please take my advice and get the sweet potato biscuits with the lobster sausage gravy!  They are to die for!  I got the lobster Mac and cheese which was more like lobster bisque over noodles but still amazing and my boyfriend got the mustard and coffee crusted pork tenderloin which was also wonderful.  Also the Szechuan green beans for a side are very good!  We didn't have one bad thing to say about the restaurant but after spending almost 150 dollars on two people the valet should have been complimentary, but we still payed 10 and tipped 5.  So maybe they could change that."}
{"text":"I have been to Fahrenheit for dinner and happy hour before and it's always been great! As soon as I found out they were going to serve brunch I made reservations which is easy on Open Table. For their first brunch everything ran so smoothly service wise and the food was amazing! They served us complimentary pecan sticky buns with we're so light and fluffy. I split the Captain Crunch pancakes and the Fried Chicken Benedict which was sooo good. The pancakes were fluffy and yummy but a different taste with the milky syrup instead of a normal maple syrup you may be used to. I'll definitely be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Eclectic American dishes...expensive, but good food.  Went here to celebrate our daughter's graduation from high school.  Atmosphere is chic and hip.

Our server started off the table with a basket of fresh breads which were warm and included both butter and an olive tapenade (briny and tasty).

As a table appetizer we ordered the \"Cleveland nachos\"...they were humongous (easily shareable between our 5 people) with thin, freshly fried potato chips, bacon, scallions and a fondue cheese sauce.  Decadent!

As a main dish I ordered the coffee and mustard-crusted pork tenderloin served with sweet potato mousse and toasted macadamia nuts (thanksgiving feel) with a side of wilted spinach.  Portion was very generous and the flavors melded together quite well.  Others around the table seemed to also enjoy their choices...a filet, gourmet mac-n-cheese and salmon.

Very much a \"special occasion\" type place (in my opinion), but worth the effort to seek them out."}
{"text":"Went here because I bought an $85 gift card for $45. My wife and I went on a Friday night. We arrive about 20 minutes before our reservation and we were invited to wait at the bar while our table was prepared. After about 10 minutes, we were in formed our table was ready. They sat us right next to the kitchen, which was kinda cool. After about 3-4 minutes, a young man (he didn't appear to be a waiter based on his black t-shirt he was wearing) came and filled up our water glasses and left. My wife and I sat there going over our menu options. During that time, no one came to welcome us or ask if we were ready or if we had any questions. About 10 minutes after we sat down, a waiter, Robert, came by and asked if anyone had checked on us. (I spent 17 years in the restaurant business and this usually means someone is not doing their job). We told him that we have only had our water glasses filled. He said \"well then I will be taking care of you tonight.\"  He took our order and the rest of the night went off without a hitch. The food was good, not great. I had the Kobe beef short ribs with lo mein. The lo mein was a bit mushy but the ribs were really good. My wife had the salmon and really had no complaints. 

Overall, Farhenheit is a good restaurant if you have the money to spend. The rooftop view was amazing. I may go back again, but I may wait for another gift card promotion."}
{"text":"I know we should perhaps give them some leniency bc it was restaurant week, but if the purpose of restaurant week is to drum up interest for the rest of the year, they need to step up their game. 

We'd heard about the amazing views, but were (reluctantly) seated at a table right by the entry. no views to be had. i asked if there were any other options, but they said it would be a 45 min wait. ok. fine. 
the bench seat is a solid 4 inches higher than the other seats at the table. awkward. 

an amuse bouche was delivered. no explanation as to what it was. it was fried. it was basically a hushpuppy-- nothing bad, but \"amuse bouche\" is quite the title for a hushpuppy. 
apps were decent all around. the glaze with the avocado was a lil strong, but as a whole, it was a delicious app. husband had calamari wish was good (but how can you go wrong with fried?). friend had something else...don't know what it was. he wasn't fond of it. he ate it, but was underwhelmed. 
pretzel bread appeared. the butter that came with it was aaaawesooome. 
i lucked out with the salmon entree. friends had short ribs that were served with chopsticks, tho i have no idea how one cuts up a chunk of cow with a chopstick. the meat was not sliced. the lobster mac and cheese was forgettable. 
dessert was decent toffee cake with a too-sweet topping and a delicious apple sauce. the brownies were hard as rocks. lil hockey pucks with decent flavor, but brownies should be warm. period. 

all in all, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was really flavorful! Especially the the caramelized cauliflower and stuffed date appetizer. VERY NOISY!  Not a good place for quiet dates. Went on a Friday night about 9. The waitress even apologized for the half hour wait between appetizer and entre arrival."}
{"text":"Not worth the time or effort...nice view, but food was over pretentious. First time in my life I have not finished my stake. First bite was good, but it was as if, the more I ate-the more I hate. It's as if the chef tried to pack too many flavors into the dish (or being pretentious and showing off). Duck rice was dry. Cheese cake was boring and ugly. The color of it was off putting from the start. The bananas on top were good, but again-too rich tasting and just didn't enjoy it. Will not return or suggest.

One star for city view, but that's it. Food bad, wait staff sub par, and no love."}
{"text":"The lobster Mac and cheese is made with chemical laced \"velveeta\" style cheese. For $40 I'd expect more than a couple pieces of lobster in velveeta. My partner had the rack of lamb and it was just okay. It came with potato wedges that tasted like something out of a Waffle House. This is somewhere to come for overpriced drinks and the view, not for the service or food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  View was great but air conditioning didn't work.  And they knew it yet stayed open and charged $30-$40 per plate.  No warning before.  Nothing.
And the food was lackluster at best.
A huge waste of time.  CLT has MUCH better."}
{"text":"The service was  Horrible. The food was  Mediocre. The only thing that this restaurant has is the view. We will not spend money at this place again. The manager did come and listen and was trying to fix the poor service. We think the waiter was on the weeds."}
{"text":"Shannan is awesome! Had more than a few drinks and every one was on POINT! We will be back! Beautiful view and super delicious cocktails! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a girls night at Fahrenheit this week. Overall, it was a wonderful evening. Everyone loved everything from the drinks to the food. 

Since this was a work group, we went early and were surprised to see an early bird 3 for $30 menu which a few took advantage of. We started with drinks of course.  All were very different, interesting and tasty. I had the one with St. Germaine. I really wanted a second one, but I had a long drive ahead. The pumpkin martini was also a hit. 

The apps and salads were next and they were yummy. The entrees were delicious, especially the lobster mac and cheese. Wow, that dish is so amazing. It's so creamy and rich.  The chicken fettucini and sausage ravioli were also very good. The size of the pasta dishes was out of control-2 meals at least. Who doesn't enjoy that?!  I had the tuna which was fresh and perfectly prepared. My only complaint (and reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) was the rice side with my tuna. It was so salty that I couldn't eat it. I was a bit shocked since I've never had an issue with anything at Fahrenheit. But heck, if this is my biggest complaint, no biggie. 

Go enjoy Fahrenheit and grab an outside table if you can. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The Alfredo was one of the best I've ever tried, and the pork shank was incredibly tender. The $10 bottle of wine could have been a few more sips worth. The decor and feel of the place did not disappoint. All in all it was an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I was there with 8 girlfriends and we were seated almost immediately (we did have a reservation).  We ordered several appetizers - the short ribs and the nachos were fantastic.  The only downside was that we waited over 1.5 hours for our entrees.  They had trouble getting it into the system - but still not a good excuse for that long of a wait.  I had the salmon and wasabi potatoes and it was delicious.  I will try it again and hope for quicker service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Fantastic service! Joy was an absolute doll that met and exceeded all of our expectations. Restaurant was clean, waitstaff was organized, timing on food was just right! Thanks Farenheit for a great night out! We will be back most definitely!"}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers for happy hour. There's a pretty narrow rooftop area that's always open and it's first come first serve. There was a reserved area,though with plenty of space. But overall you get the rooftop vibe even if you're not on the balcony. We ordered a bunch of appetizers but my favorite was the chorizo stuffed dates. 

I also like the tempura rock shrimp. It wasn't particularly sweet, more like creamy.
We ordered the North Carolina Cajun shrimp which came in about 8 pieces of shrimp and some toast- more on the savory side.
The North Carolina nachos were a bit too greasy for me."}
{"text":"Horrible bartending service. Over-priced drinks, $36 for two redbull and vodkas. It took about 15 minutes before I had my drink, they were not busy. The only decent thing was the fact that it was a roof top bar overlooking tiny downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went with high expectations, and wasn't overwhelmed.  It was very noisy.  So much that we asked to move and still almost lost our voices. The cocktails and wine list were the norm for hipster Tremont.  Creative but limited. The food was very good, just not amazing or creative.  Our server matched the food.  It was a very good meal, in line with other Tremont nouveau, but not a stand out.  You won't go wrong here, and we left satisfied, but not blown away."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Large part of bar area blocked off and wanted dinner at 5p. Only bar stools and 2 tables with 4 chairs available one table occupied. The decor was terrible. I am not from NC but it was dark with little to no decor. Ordered Butterfly Spiced Shrimp .. nothing BUTTERFLY about it and taste was so so and was suppose to have jalapeño.. I'm from TX and I didn't detect any... Spiced gives the wrong impression. 
Extremely disappointed in the BLT Salad. No taste and if there was dressing it was missing because there was absolutely no taste. I will not return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricey, but good.  Had the ahi tuna nachos for an appetizer and those were great!  Ordered the bass for an entree.  The bass was cooked perfectly and very tasty, but the kale and cauliflower that came with it were so good they almost stole the show!  Someone sitting near me at the bar ordered the shishito peppers and they looked and smelled great, so I'll probably order those next time.

The beer list is just okay.  They specialize more in wine and cocktails."}
{"text":"Food cold, they put the teenie in martini. Canned curry powder saturated spring rolls. Oysters were the only decent thing. One complaint and I was ostracized for the evening. Waited 20 minutes for my espresso. Never ever coming again."}
{"text":"The food was just OK considering the price. The location and ambiance are wonderful and make for a really fun dinner! But I had my birthday dinner here and the whole table was pretty let down on the overall taste. The menu wasn't anything too special and for the price of the food I was just expecting a lot more. I haven't been back since November, and haven't had a hankering to return."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked food and beautiful view!

I would gladly eat this food at ground level looking out the window at a parking deck, but was happy to eat looking through a fire pit gazing at the Charlotte skyline!

Everything we had for dinner was amazing. The short rib buns were melt-in-your-mouth sweet and tangy deliciousness. I got a wok-fried red snapper and my girlfriend decided on the pork chop. Both were generous portions (much appreciated) and expertly cooked. The sauces and sides that came with both were perfect compliments to the dishes.

The staff was attentive and knowledgable, our waitress was happy to recommend wines, and our dishes came out in a timely manner.

Definitely will return and will recommend Fahrenheit to anyone within shouting distance."}
{"text":"I realize restaurants are always sub-par on holidays such as Mother's Day, but this pls e was very disappointing .. 
First, they brag that all tables have a view,except the one we were at. Then they had no beverages small children might like. I realize that they do not generally cater to kids, but considering the occasion they should have made plans. 
The food choices, individually, tasted great,but you would expect that they would continue to replenish the seving stations rather than have three straggly pieces of waffle,etc
The fruit looked great, but shouldn't a chef know not to serve kiwi that was not ripe?
Lastly, the service was sluggish and dirty plates just stayed on the table. Considering that there was no real serving going on, other than drinks, what was the staff doing?"}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is one of my favorite places to go for a both a fantastic happy hour or a romantic dinner!

While they don't open till 5 their happy hour is well worth it! Unfortunately they no longer offer free bacon during happy hour but have replaced it with delicious seasoned breadsticks.

Their bar menu is delicious and the happy hour pizza is a must taste! While the idea of brie, parmesan and goat cheeses paired with maple syrup made me cringe at first glance it turned out to be one of the most delicious pizzas I've ever had. 

Their sangria is addictive and fantastically refreshing during the summer and at $5 a glass during happy hour you can drink to your hearts and wallet content.

As far as the dinner menu goes, the 18 hour pork shank is melt in your mouth delicious-- paired it with their buttery mashed potatoes pure magic. 

The staff and atmosphere match the quality of of the cuisine. A truly great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Total package, this place is the real deal.  To top it off looking at the sunset from the 21st floor is amazing.  Ary helped make the experience amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is very good.   I would have given them 5 stars but our party of 8 was sat at a table next to the kitchen.  It is hot in this corner.  We asked three times for them to adjust the temperature since the  thermostat was reading 79 degrees.  Not happy.  Apparently, according to our water, we were not the only ones that had complained about this.  A manager walked by several times as we were using the menus to fan ourselves.  Eventually he came over as we asked for him.  No real change happened at all after he came over to our table.  Not a great way to show you appreciate your paying customers!  Shame.."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for drinks but never for dinner. I saw them on the restaurant week listings - $35 bucks for a 3 course meal. What a deal!

First course - Crispy Calamari which honestly the worse calamari I had in awhile. It was too fried. All I tasted was breading. I couldn't even finish it. My friend ordered wings which surprisingly good.

Second course - I ordered Teres Major Steak. I did not realize that a nice fancy restaurant like this can have a horrible steak too. It was difficult to cut it was a \"steak knife.\" When I finally able to cut a piece, it was not what I excepted. It felt like I was chewing gum. Honestly, It probably wasn't steak. I asked my server if I can switch it to the salmon - even though the sever didn't ask me how I like the salmon cooked (med-rare), it came out asap and it was good.
 My friend ordered Slow-Braised Kobe Beef Short Ribs which was very tender and falling off the chopsticks when picking up. It was also good, but not amazing. 
Third course - dessert!!!! Meyer Lemon & Marcona Almond Mousse was what we got. It was okay. Nothing special.

Overall, it's a perfect place for drinks after work to watch the sunset. But I would not go back for the food."}
{"text":"Came out for my wife birthday. The drinks and food are at a reasonable price. You get to enjoy a beautiful view of uptown Charlotte. Great ambiance. Awesome music plays throughout the restaurant. I called ahead of time for reservations and they were all booked up. But there was plenty of room on the patio to drink and eat."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! the captain crunch pancakes are amazing! prices seem expensive at first but once you get the food, it is worth it! awesome view of all Charlotte and overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"First Tim in Cleveland an a friend recommended this place.  What a great find! Try the pork shank it's the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to eat great food! We even travel to other cities  chasing down  \" Top Chefs\".  So when we heard that Fahrenheit was opening in Charlotte, we were very excited to try the new restaurant and taste from an appetizing menu selection.   Just so you know we are not huge food snobs, we just enjoy great food and great  wine, along with that we also look at the atmosphere, the waitstaff and how our overall evening went while at the restaurant.  Here is how it went for us. 

We arrived and entered the lobby. We did not see a sign where to go, so we went to the first elevator closes to us. But before we got on, we were asked if we were going to the restaurant and she kindly directed us to the elevator on the far side.  

When we got off the elevator and walked into the restaurant we were greeted by a very energetic hostess.  She asked if we had reservations, we told her our reservations were for later in the evening and that we were going to go and enjoy a cocktail before sitting down to dinner.  The restaurant and bar were alive with customers talking and just having a great time.  As we walked down the stairs towards the bar you start to see the incredible view of downtown Charlotte.  Not knowing if they had waitstaff handling the outside area where the couches were.   I stopped and asked the bartender if they did. It took her a few minutes but she finally looked up and said yes or we could open a tab with her.  We elected just to have the waitstaff take care of  us outside on the terrace.  We sat down, she showed up pretty promptly handed us two menus one for the food one for the specialty cocktails.  Unfortunately nowhere on these two list was there a wine by the glass menu.  So we waited 6-7 minutes until she showed back up and we asked for a list.  After about 15 minutes she came back by (not her fault she got held up by another table) and we just asked for a Malbec and Scotch.  Drinks  arrived in about 7 minutes later. We then just enjoyed the whole experience,  looking out over Charlotte.  

\"Smart Casual \" was the dress code.  To me that would be a collared shirt, nice jeans and decent pair of shoes.  Others were wearing cut off raggedy jean shorts, flip-flops and T-shirts.  

OK now for dinner. We finished our drinks, paid our tab and went to see the hostess.  She sat us promptly.  The table was located to the left as soon as you walk in ( not the best of views but we also don't expect it ).  Our server was prompt, explained all the specials and was over all very nice.  She asked for our drink order, we were undecided and asked for a few more minutes.  Another server showed up asked what kind of water we would like  \" Good old Charlotte water is fine\" with us.  The server comes back and we have made decision on what we want.  So we decided on a bottle and Quintessa $275.00.  So she brings out the decanter, pop the cork, decant the wine, takes our appetizer order and then leaves.  So we sit there talking to each other , she pops back by takes our main course order and then leaves again.   Appetizer shows up she comes by again, she asked how everything was, we said  great we ordered The chrizzio wrapped dates and the local cheese and meat board.  We did ask her about the cheese all she said is that it is a local cheddar and blue cheese with no real description.  The appetizer came with only two crustiness. We did ask for more, never got them.  The frustrating part is that at this point she still has not even poured the wine so we went ahead and took care of that part ourselves.  Salad course ordered the beets, they were very delicious.  Main course, wife ordered pork shank,  I ordered the 45 day aged strip bone in with a side of king crab.  Pork shank fall off the bone tender perfectly done the only downfall was that the grits became too sweet and the broccoli was steamed. Kind of an afterthought compared to the way other sides were prepared. The strip,  I do question if this is a 45 day age strip.  I actually age my own beef, this steak was not as tender nor did have that gammy taste.  Other than that the steak was cooked perfectly,  great crust and the temp I ordered it Mid- rare.  My side was fingerling potatoes not very impressed it's almost like they were cooked  the day before thrown in the fridge and warmed up to serve.  Deserts, wife got the chocolate chip cookie with the local milk.  Very tasty.  I got the small chocolate bars which actually come to the Ritz Carlton but all the same. Delicious.  

So after dinner,  we paid the bill( total night $650 and yes this is on the extreme side) , went back to the bar grabed a scotch , glass of champagne and recapped on our evening.  This is what we came up with. 


Hostess- Great
Food- Good
Service - Ok
Atmosphere- Great 
Bar staff - Great
Manager- would have  liked to have seen them a least stop by see how the meal was. 
People watching- phenomenal but I've run out of characters to tell you that story."}
{"text":"Food was awesome.
They Gave my friend a hard time trying to get reservations though."}
{"text":"I have recently moved to Charlotte from Ohio & have been hitting up the restaurant scene almost every weekend. I was so excited to find out that Rocco had opened another restaurant & this time it is in Charlotte! I am very familiar with his food because it was one of my favorite restaurants back home. I met my girlfriend here for a great Saturday night together. We sat up at the bar & had dinner & drinks. I had the kale salad which to me was killer but the best part by far was my entree. I had the pork tenderloin because I know he does it to perfection & he did not disappoint! My friend had the lamb & loved it as well. Our plates looked clean when we were done! If you are looking for a great restaurant &  experience with the best view in Charlotte.... You must go to Fahrenheit! We had a blast!! Loved every minute of it!"}
{"text":"LOVED everything about this place! Well, other than the parking but luckily they have valet. 
We went here last night with a group of 4 and I think we all loved everything we ate and drank. I started with a Dr. Bob Martini and it was amazing! Everyone had salads other than me and they were very fresh, very unique. I had the pork shank and it fell right off the bone when my fork touched it. The polenta had a sweet flavor to it and was perfect. We ended with dessert martinis and the apple dessert. To die for!
Our service was wonderful too. The server was attentive without being annoying and also knowledgable. We spent 2 hours there and was definitely took our time chatting. They were super busy and very tactfully informed us that the next reservation was there for our table, so the manager would buy us a drink if we would relocate to the bar. We thought this was a great compromise! We did not go to the bar though for the drink, as we were ready to go at that point. 
We will definitely be going back! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite place to eat in tremont. This a a perfect place to go for a great meal. Great wine selection as well..."}
{"text":"Stopped off in the afternoon at this rooftop bar/restaurant. Great views of Charlotte. Pricey menu, but worth it in my opinion. We didn't really eat, just shared some apps and a pizza, both which were tasty. The wood grilled avocado was my fave; the toast came with a goat cheese spread and like a sweet drizzle, it was amazing; would recommend getting this. One of my friends is vegan, so the pizza was an arugula and onion pizza, no cheese, and it was still good. My gf said her cocktail was one of the best she's ever had. If you're looking for some good eats and atmosphere, this is the place. Like I said, bit on the pricey side, but go ahead, spoil yourself!"}
{"text":"I asked my cousin to take me to a restaurant with an \"Experience\" and that is just what we got! 
First, the location was gorgeous! Sitting 21 floors overlooking downtown Charlotte, the dining room was kept at a low tone, but one that made you know everyone was enjoying theirselves... 
Our appetizer was delicious, roasted Avocados served on bread smeared in Goat Cheese. DELICIOUS. 
We ordered the scallops and fillet for dinner. I would personally like to thank the chief, the scallops were soaked in flavor and the fillet was ever so juicy! 
Lastly, the heath milkshake was alone worth the visit... 
Our server, Nick, had really great timing. He could tell we wanted to be wined and dined. 
I am thankful for the lovely experience my cousin and myself shared in this establishment and I would highly recommend taking extra time for this dining experience. 
The elevators did run slow, but regardless, the experience was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing meal!  I was visiting clients in Charlotte and they recommended this restaurant (also which turned out to be on the roof of my hotel), and I'm so glad we took them there!  Unfortunately there was a private event going on on the outdoor patio, but we still appreciated the views and the excellent food and wine!  I highly recommend the short rib, the bacon wrapped dates, and their very unique take on nachos.  And it is my new goal in life to figure out how they make that amazing honey cilantro sauce for their calamari!  Definitely not on the cheap side whatsoever, but worth shelling out on a high quality meal.   Would definitely go again on return visits to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is still relatively new but has a great deal to offer.  Aside from a great view of the city their menu is always wonderful and the bar is an awesome place to stop and grab drinks during the week and on the weekend.  I love the staff here."}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant and will never return. We had drinks at the bar which we paid full price during happy hour and when we left the bartender chased us out to the sidewalk and asked if we paid our drink tab. Never has this ever happen in my life. Four moms from Avon Ohio trying to skip out on a bill - really? 
called and talked to manager and she said he is just busy and apologized - very humiliating after we spent $58 for four drink. Ridiculous !"}
{"text":"This was a funny place. Amazing views, well worth the visit, even if you're just stopping in for a drink. Our dinner was really terrific - the carmelized cauliflower was wonderful. My dinner was a simple burger, but man it was yummy. My date had a kale salad with salmon that she really enjoyed too. Super fresh. Super bright.  Drinks were good. The house Cabernet was a little weird - tasted like a glass of pepper, but I should have just changed out for another drink. 

Our waiter, Wes, was amazing. Smart, charming, funny, and knowledgeable. 

The only reason I gave it four stars and not five was because the music was a little too loud and way out of step with the meal. It was top-40. Kind of strange.

I would recommend it fully. Go enjoy."}
{"text":"My faith in Cleveland cuisine has been restored, having dined at a truly awful establishment less than 24 hours previously.

On the recommendation of a Lyft driver, we made our way to Fahrenheit for a mod-day meal on Sunday.

Wow!

From the ambiance to the friendly wait staff, to the excellent service and sumptuous meals--this place had it all!

As we savored each bite of our food, my husband and I remarked that \"this is what a restaurant experience is supposed to feel like.\"

We felt full, we felt spoiled, we felt pampered, we felt much better than when we walked in.

As we left the restaurant, I found myself wondering if it would be foolish to order delivery from this place--which is a more than two hour drive from our home!

Wishful thinking, but it just means it's a place we won't long forget."}
{"text":"Great place to bring friends and family, especially if they're visiting from out of town. That being said, I don't think I will be a \"regular\" here, as nothing is super stand out on the menu. However, If you've never been, you need to get up there at least once! The staff was very friendly and of course the view is second to none."}
{"text":"The service and food has been going downhill since the time it first opened.  The first few times I went it was great. The last time I went a few months ago, it was subpar.  Service is slow and waiters are not knowledgeable about their menu."}
{"text":"This was seriously absolutely fantastic!! I stayed at the Hyatt Place and went up to the bar and ordered my meal to go.

I ordered the Salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes (which were to die for, and I don't even like wasabi) and pickled cucumbers, and even though I took this meal to go in a little to-go carton, this was one of the best meals I've ever had in my entire life. Every single piece of the meal had it's own unique flavor, and I didn't want to stop eating even though I was completely stuffed full. I 100% recommend this restaurant to ANYONE!! View is also incredible if you're eating at the restaurant - even at the bar it's beautiful!

I never write reviews but this one was totally worth it... AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a Great experience! Food was delicious and the service just perfect by Sarah our waitress definitely coming back for dinner when I get back to Charlotte"}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktail.  Good service.  Mediocre food."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday celebration and had reservations for four.   There was no problem with getting seated.  We were there early to enjoy the view and have a drink.  I think this establishment is definitely for a younger group and mainly just for the view and a drink.  After we were seated I noticed that there were many empty tables.  Friday night 8 pm? 
 Our waitress was very good and the general manager came to our table several times and was great.  The food, what can I say about the food? Our table had a bone in ribeye that had a lot of fat in it even for a ribeye.  Also ordered a filet, it was cooked perfectly but was only lukewarm by the time it got to us.  As a Ruth's Chris fan a hot steak is hard to beat.  We had a couple of appetizers that were good but not outstanding. In summary, go for the view, have a drink, take your picture but don't expect over the top food.  Price $180 for four and we split entrees."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by the rude behavior of the bartenders this evening. Being in the industry I know that when you are busy it can be difficult to always keep things on point but one in particular was very rude. The level of hospitality I expected was not present this evening. My cocktail was good though. Just served with quite a bit of attitude."}
{"text":"Went here for prom, slow service. Was almost here for 3 hours and they didn't have enough table settings for us even though we called a month ahead. Food was good, just lots of waiting."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, great service, we went for Cleveland restaurant week and ordered off the tasting menu. Overall the food was good but I was expecting much better for the price. We got the chicken egg rolls as an app which were just okay (not that good), then I got the lobster rolls for my 1st course which were pretty much just bread with a blop of mayo and a piece of crab. For 2nd course I got the salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes which was good don't get me wrong but not great. I was expecting way better quality of salmon. The dessert was the best part - I got the cookie dough dish which was incredible! My husband though got the Buckeye desert which just tasted like a bunch of peanut butter. 
Overall, okay experience but again not worth the price. We probably won't be going back just because there are other restaurants in the area we could spend $150 at and have an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place and today ( the beginning of my birthday week) was the best day to go. We sat out on the patio.  We had the nachos, mushroom pizza and Spring rolls ( you only get 2) and everything was delicious. I really enjoyed it but I was also in really great company. They have half price apps until 6:30 (on select items). But if you've never had the chance to visit, make sure you do. The views are breathtaking!!!! (Warning: there is a fire burning outside and they won't turn it off, so if you sit near it, it may get a little hot)"}
{"text":"Oh mah freaking gawd! AMAZING, ah-mazing, a m a z i n g !

First things first... we made reservations for Friday night at 7pm, the bar was hopping at this point (haaaappy hour!) but there were plenty of tables open when we got there, that eventually filled before we left.

Now let me just say that our visit to Fahrenheit last night is now honestly on the top of my list of nights out in 2013. The food was delish, the drinks hit the spot, the servers were fantastic and knowledgeable, and the ambiance was very trendy, cool, laid back, and classy all at the same time. The decor screamed classic contemporary to me, and I was in love. Dark woods, jazzy light fixtures, white table clothes, contemporary chairs, tall gold booths, and a \"wine cellar\"? LOVE.

One of the first things I noticed about Fahrenheit was the diversity of seating. Are you alone? Sit at the bar. Do you have a date? Sit at one of the tables nestled in the back. Are you in a group? Put any number of tables together in different areas and you have room for the whole party. I couldn't stop thinking about how well the layout of the restaurant lent itself to different functions - solo happy hour, first dates, double dates, family celebrations, work holiday parties, rehearsal dinners... that is until the \"Cleveland\" Nachos got to our table (and I don't even like goat cheese! - see my Lolita review). Then all I could think about was how to get more of the delectable crispy fried potatoes in my mouth. Seriously. Then I tried the \"All Day Bacon\" appetizer, mmm melt in your mouth bacon atop some kind of delicious cornmeal. Wowza. I ordered the Lemonade Stand martini (berry vodka and lemonade) to drink - very refreshing.

We could see the kitchen from where we were seated, which I really love about a restaurant. Per Fahrenheit's website \"the menu changes seasonally to make the most of current harvests and the freshest produce, herbs and spices\" - how fab. I ordered the Coffee and Mustard Crusted Pork Tenderloin (Maple Glazed Sweet Potato, Garlic Spinach, Toasted Macadamia Nuts), which I was told has been a long standing popular menu item and the boy toy ordered the menu item that Fahrenheit is well known for - the Kobe Beef Short Ribs (Teriyaki Lo-Mein Noodles, Bitter Broccoli, Baby Bok Choy, Roasted Mushrooms, Ginger, Soy-Apple Glaze). These dishes cost us (ok, him) a pretty penny - but the price was well worth the experience and the deliciousness of the food. I'm not gonna say I wouldn't be happy if the menu prices were slightly lowered because if they were I'd be able to go back a whole lot sooner!

Note on parking - this is Tremont... there was limited street parking available, we got a spot right outside around the corner; but they have valet available directly out front in case you can't find one.

I want to come back for every date night, birthday, or special occasion and I want to bring everyone I know with me so they can partake in the awesome deliciousness that is Fahrenheit. Yum."}
{"text":"VALENTINES DRINKS. Came to this roof top bar on a cold January night for some drinks and desert. It was cold and windy and the outdoor fires went really cutting it. However, after we went inside and sat in our corner seat, we were warm and the drinks were good. Friendly staff and good desert. It was a week night and it was early in the night, but it made the night. Great views any time of day."}
{"text":"The food was good but our service was terrible. It took 15 minutes before our initial contact with our server, she forgot several items requested, and barely came back to check on us. Love the atmosphere and rooftop but IF I come back, I'll probably sit at the bar instead of a table."}
{"text":"I was truly looking forward to having Brunch here at Fahrenheit but the experience/food was below average. Wouldn't come back at all! Ordered the Chicken Benedict but they forgot the egg. Also, our server forgot about us leaving us to wait 30min before grabbing another waitress. All n all a very bad experience!"}
{"text":"As out of towners, we enjoyed a nice dinner in Tremont at Fahrenheit.  Be prepared to pay $6 for valet - we couldn't find any street parking.  The chicken spring rolls were good, but not great - a little too nutty tasting for me.  The pizza, however, was fabulous.  Our server was very educated on the menu and the various ingredients/flavors - we were quite impressed with her knowledge on each item actually.  The atmosphere is modern, but noisy."}
{"text":"I did not want to write a negative review but since the manager was so delightful and nice considering the staff I decided just to give a review. I do not live in Charlotte, visiting and a friend recommended this rooftop bar for a few drinks and on to the next spot. It was a Tuesday so it was a nice crowd, not overly crowded, seemed like a few groups that frequent the place for after work chat and drinks.
I saw an empty area so I kindly waited to be greeted by the bar staff/mixologist. No acknowledgement and it was a little odd as I asked a patron sitting down if this was an area where someone was sitting becuz we there were four empty seats. The person sitting by said that no one was sitting down but they asked why the bar staff didn't say anything. So I just assumed maybe this the laid back pace here in Charlotte but I've been here for three days and haven't experienced this. 
Even at the ritz where I'm staying no problem, so I'm assuming maybe something is going on. The bar staff literally took her time making a drink so I was thinking maybe they were playing with the drink, or learning a drink because they were seriously overly going slow. Finally the bar staff gave the drink to a customer. Still not the universal \" hey you guys, give me one moment and I'll be right with you.\" So I told my friend who does not drink alcohol that I'm going to the other side of the bar. A bar staff asked if I wanted a menu, I thanked them and asked for a drink. I was told to wait, no problem I'm just happy that I was acknowledged. 
My friend on the other side told me to come back over so I did and the same bar person for some reason had a dislike to me or something odd. So the two bar staff spoke and when I asked for my order, I was beginning to let the bartender know that I told the other person I wanted a drink and after I said that the bartender stated \" yes she was getting you a drink, you just have to wait,\" I mentioned that it's no problem, she can get me a drink and the other person can make, I'm paying for the drinks so if I have more than one perfect. (In my eyes that's a win as I don't have to go back to the bar). So I ordered the $17 glass of wine, took forever to pour, my other friend wanted a Mai tai and from a patron listening the girls didn't know how to make and when my friend got it they didn't drink as they mentioned it was not good.(I got wine because you cannot mess wine up)didn't take the drink back,just ordered different drinks.

Going to the table, the manager came by and asked if we needed anything and he also introduced himself. I asked for a drink and I do wish I would've just stayed at the table and had a waitress get drinks but I wasn't aware that you could. 
This is a very lengthy review and I wouldn't do this but I've traveled all over from Italy, French Polynesia, Africa, Germany, many places in the states. You never should judge a book by its cover. Always treat people the same as you never know who you will meet. I've always remember that and I treat everyone the way I would like to be treated. 
The bar staff at this establishment should be aware that universally when dealing with the public you acknowledge them to let them know you see them and you'll service them when you get a chance. That was all I needed. I'm very big on that especially if you work in an environment like that. I've been to places that I wouldn't assume would have great customer service and I received A1 service which deserved a hefty tip to show appreciation. You never know who is watching so always be kind and respectful to the next.  Will I come back, no I will not, but the place does have a nice atmosphere and vibe."}
{"text":"I can assure you that I will never be returning to Fahrenheit. The bartenders where incredibly rude, we did not stay for dinner due to the dreadful service and statements made by the bartenders."}
{"text":"We came for a drink and apps.  The website makes the restaurant seem snooty, that is certainly not the case.  Casual feel, great service, local beer, and ahi tuna wontons were out of this world.  We live out of state, but if we resided here we would absolutely return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with view of the Charlotte skyline, had terrific service, food was very good but expensive for what you get. Steve the Manager on duty was very attentive as was his staff. I would visit again."}
{"text":"After our perfect experience last time, we took an out of town friend. Her pizza didn't have much flavor, but my entree was great. Soon after we were seated, however, a large party was seated right by us. We couldn't  even have a conversation, it became so loud. We tried to move out to the patio, but there was no seating. We enjoyed the view for a few minutes and then left. I was so disappointed. I really wanted to show Charlotte off to her, and I wasn't able to. I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"We were hoping to get a table last minute on a Saturday but the place was packed - always a good sign. They immediately found a table in the bar area. It actually turned out great. Awesome view of the city! Good was top notch. I was craving a burger and made the right choice. Even all the appetizers were great. Bar area could of used a few more waitresses, but other then that we'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"My family and I were on our way to Bourbon Street Barrel, for Brunch, but decided to try Fahrenheit's Brunch instead and I must say, I'm glad we did. The food was delicious. I had the Chicken Benedict (Our server Lisa recommendation) and it was yummy! Almost too yummy! If there's a such thing. My Mom had a sandwich called \"The Bae\" and that was also delicious. My Dad had a Breakfast Pizza. I don't eat pizza , but he and my Mom were fans and said they will order it again and were debating on ordering one Togo. We would've only givin this place a 4 but, our server Lisa, was A-MAZING! Like, She was hands down, the best server we've ever had so, The extra star is for her. So sweet and attentive but, not overly attentive. Great Job Fahrenheit! I will be sure to make my way to Tremont more often!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a girls night out and loved every minute of it! They have great bar seating which is amazing for a GNO. They have a large balcony with spectacular views of the city (especially at night)! Highly recommend visiting here for tapas or just a relaxing happy hour."}
{"text":"Wow I have to say having that view really can make a dinner. The bill will do the same when it comes around too but it's worth it I'm telling you. So we tried the tangerine dream.... it was awful. I'm sorry and I don't mean to be mean when I say it but that's why it was only four stars. Our server was KC, and for being 10 pm at night he was still on point. When we told him we didn't like the drinks he got us new ones right away, Long Island iced tea. Those were so good! Would go back again"}
{"text":"Yes, best view in town and there are tasty dishes on the menu but after having been there several times, my my recent visit was a collosal let down. I took a good friend for her birthday (chef) and after raving to her about it, I was embarrassed by my choice. Diners should expect quality good, drink and service at any price but $18 appetizers and $30-$50 entrees, I don't expect to have to send back three cocktails, one (completely tasteless) appetizer, and to ask for the manager, Adam Quigley to come to the table( only to have to track him down myself). I shared my concerns w Adam and basically tried to dismiss my comlaints by telling me that other customers enjoyed their meals-- as if that had anything to do my experience....???  I don't know how he long has been there but if his interaction w me is any indication of his brand of management, Farenheit should do better. 
I also thought it was odd that after noting that our reservation was for a birthday ( I told reservation the hostess, waitress and manager), no one acknowledged it until after we paid the bill and our waitress heard us lamenting the bad experience. We were done w our meal, dinner and dessert and she had someone bring a Sunday to the table.
All in all, when you're looking for fine dining, it's not just about food. It's about the entire.exprience and our entire party was very disappointed. It wasn't worth the nearly $400 bill"}
{"text":"So, tonight must be my 10th time here. Over the past two years, the service and food quality has deteriorated to become unrecognizable. The waiter didn't know the specials. The food came out cold and he was missing for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem in the Tremont area and one of my favorite places to go. Every meal i've had there has been delicious. It is a bit pricy but well worth it. Clean, cozy and romanticish place, can be a bit louder at times but not often. The staff is nothing but friendly, attentive, helpful and quick."}
{"text":"Called to make reservations and the hostess was extremely rude. Will not be eating here."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I would take folks unfamiliar with charlotte here so that they could see the skyline...in the growing space of rooftop venues/restaurants, this was a good view with decent food. My two star review is from the poor service that I received while was there last. I was seated at a table near the windows. The waitress required me to let her hold my card before I could order dinner. Surely this had to be because I was near the bar.... But.... I had never had this request on previous visits so I thought it was odd. I then asked others in my area if they had to provide a credit card in advance of ordering.... Every single person said that they didn't. I'm extremely disappointed in the service. I asked my waitress (Hannah) why I had to leave a card and she said it was policy. When I advised her that everyone else in the section was outside of the policy she just had a dumb look on her face and assured me that my card was safe.... Well Hannah that wasn't the issue. I gave two stars for the view alone. I guess Hannah was afraid that I'd parachute off the building or run to the elevator right in front of the restaurant  and wait five minutes for it to escape paying for my meal. Guess who didn't get anymore refills after I confronted Hannah? Too many other rooftops around for this nonsense."}
{"text":"We recently hosted a fundraising event at our home and T.J. and the great folks at Fahrenheit catered the event.  It was sparkling from top to bottom.  There was great attention to detail and overall, I felt very taken care of. The food was beautifully presented and delicious.  There really was a special \"pizazz\" in the the whole presentation. My guests raved about it for weeks on end!  I highly recommend Fahrenheit not only as a great restaurant to enjoy, but superb service and artistry when catering as well."}
{"text":"Incredible view! The staff was amazing and very helpful. They were also very knowledgeable with all of the selections we made, including wine. For our entrees, we ordered the Maine Diver Scallops, and the Grilled Kurobuta Pork Chop. The scallops were impressive and were extremely well prepared. The bacon and maple added a nice sweet flavor to the dish. The brussel sprouts were slightly crispy, but were nicely seasoned. The pork chop was so tender and melt in your mouth good, it also came with rice. We were extremely pleased, and will definitely be recommending this place to our friends and family!!"}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed.....i was so excited to dine at Fahrenheit.

Today we celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary  and decided to try Fahrenheit.  The experience started off great with the hostess on the phone.  Upon our arrival, We were escorted to a very nice seat by the window with a great view.  The server was not very attentive.  He joined us about 10 minutes after being seated.  The restaurant was not crowded.  We arrived at 5:45pm.  

 My husband had to ask for a water refill from the runner.  We then had to suggest to him to take our entree order?   After he picked up our appetizer plates and our entrees arrived, i had to ask for a dinner plate because he gave me a salad fork.  

The calamari and salmon were both over cooked.  I was expecting someone from the management team to stop by since we complained about one dish and sent another back.  I mentioned to the general manager and management about how disappointed we were about the service and the food and they both responded the same, \"oh well.\"  As a small business owner, we weren't expecting any thing but an empathetic  acknowledgement of our dissatisfaction.

Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I had a horrible experience at the Fahrenheit. Customer service really sucked. We booked seating for a party of 12 a month in advance. We had awful seating.Our waitress disappeared for looong periods of time. We were served 2 hours after being seated. A pork entrée was served to us raw, dangerously undercooked. Management was uncaring. Instead of discounting the meal, they deducted the gratuity. The owner needs to do some checking on that Charlotte, North Carolina location. Soooooooo bad!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful views of the city. New, clean, and \"hip.\" 

The opportunities? Train the staff and teach hospitality (perhaps this will be ironed out as the restaurant settles in... But any server worth his or her salt should know how to present and pour $150 bottle of wine). Food was solid but nothing to necessarily brag about. Rave reviews of the cuisine from the other restaurant in Cleveland can't quite yet be attributable to Charlotte. Most everything we received from the kitchen was cold or room temperature at best -so hard to make a good judgment on cuisine. I had the pork tenderloin but it was set atop a cold mushy serving of sweet potatoes so tough to taste the flavoring itself. The apps were tasty and salad was fresh. 

The decor itself is interesting - the fluorescent lights scour the eyes and diminish the elegance. And last. Be prepared to valet your car at the Hyatt downstairs and pay for parking."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant! Service , food, atmosphere, I give 10 stars!  The pretzel rolls are ridiculous! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The venue is great.  Beautiful view of the skyline outside with outdoor seating to boot.  For me, that's where the value stops.  

From the twenty minute wait for drinks, to less than exciting cocktails after the wait, things started off rocky.

The cuisine wasn't for me it seems either.  With the table's meal service arriving mixed up and unsure of who ordered what plate to start then the cuisine itself not reaching the quality level expected for the price paid.  

From short rib that was chewy to steaks that while cooked nicely tasted of what was perhaps a soy sauce marinade that overpowered the meats flavor, and appetizers that had the same problem,  the dining experience just didn't match the price tag (approximately $100 a person on this trip)

And to top it off.. The slow and confused service came pre-billed to our parties tab at 20%...

If you're out for a beer and looking for a great view of Charlotte, I recommend it,  otherwise I'll spend my time somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love the rooftop dining experience. Food is good and people watching is great.  Every dish has a variety of strongly flavored sauces which can clash with each other. You have to order carefully so as not to be overwhelmed.  Portions are plentiful."}
{"text":"Welcoming and the manager, 5
Drinks at bar, 5
Seated in a timely Manner. 
Sat for a while. 
Two people eventually greeted us and said our server was outside (maybe smoking a joint). 
They did our drinks. Later our apps. 

Finally our server showed up. 

Apps were amazing. Dates. Buns. Mussels. 
Food was amazing too. 

Our service was awful. Maybe she kept smoking joints. IdK. 3 hours to eat and an hour of that was waiting on her....  and after 2 requests I finally said I need my check, now. Tip? Oh, table of 6 and it was included. What a shame she did so bad at her job and received a good reward."}
{"text":"As many will tell you , the food is good but not great. The drinks are delicious but expensive. The staff is friendly but not amazing. But the VIEW. Holy moly the view. Go have a drink and an app at happy hour and enjoy sunset over the Queen City because the view is worth it."}
{"text":"Bartenders and food were great. The waitresses and hostess were extremely rude and offensive."}
{"text":"Food outshined the service. 

My girlfriend and I were visiting friends in Charlotte and decided to go somewhere upscale for NYE dinner. We had placed a reservation a month in advance. The week of, my friend had received multiple emails and phone calls confirming our reservation for that evening. We had thought because of this follow up service, we were to expect the same upon arrival. 

We arrived on time and were notified they were running a little behind. They took our number and said they would provide a text when ready. We decided to go to bar and get a drink and stand outside to enjoy the sights and views. After about 30-45 mins we went to the hostess stand to inquire and the lady had mentioned \"oh yes, I do see your table is ready.\"

We were seated for a table of 6 right next to the kitchen door. Terrible planning. Some of my guests were constantly having chairs bumped into by staff. Knowing it was a busy night, we tried to be a little more understanding. The server took some time to come back to us for drink orders and food orders and at one point another waiter came over to help. 

Beyond that, the food we all had was excellent and amazing in quality!! I had a bisque soup, Caesar salad, Braised short ribs, and butterscotch Brule dessert. All were delivered to table in perfect sequence and all plates were clean when waiter came by to clear table!

A pricey fixed menu due to occasion which we all understood. 

Will return next time I am in Charlotte"}
{"text":"The choices are wide and varied - everything looked very good on the menu. They have daily specials - great app of roasted avocado with goat cheese crustini. It was a special but supposedly going on the menu soon. The lobster mac and cheese is over the top. Incredibly rich but so good that you don't stop eating. One issue was the wine by the glass - the white was excellent (New Zealand) but the red had almost turned. It was early in the evening and not very busy so I would have hoped that the bartender would have tried the open bottle but that did not seem to happen."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!!! The view of the city is Gorgeous but that's about ALL this place has... Food was ok. Service was completely horrible, guess when 20% is already included (we had 11 people) there is NO need to do your best, even when you do charge an arm and a leg for mediocre... And don't get me started about the management or lack there of..... Not to mention, don't even think about bringing your own birthday cake as they charge you $5 per slice they cut & service.. and don't order the coffee because it won't be hot. What a $1,100.00 mistake......"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good - the views here are phenomenal. If you're looking for a good place to bring a date, do a girls night out or just take some really cool pics...this is the spot!

I enjoyed the food too. I ordered a Tangerine Dream to start it's refreshing but packs a punch! I loved the spiced rum and fresh citrus mixed. For an app, I ordered the crispy tempura rock shrimp. Very well done! It's the honey glaze sauce that makes this dish. I'd absolutely order it again.For dinner, I ordered the pepperoni pizza. It's definitely more than enough to share between two people. I enjoyed this as well, the toppings to pizza crust ratio was just right and I really loved the pepperonis. 

So, why just three stars? The service here was a huge let down.

 I'm just going to say what we all know...average or crappy service can ruin the whole experience. That's what happened here. I do not think it's too much to ask for people to be attentive and knowledgeable during your visit. 

This place has the potential be be great - they just have to step it up when it comes to the customer service."}
{"text":"My wife called to set a reservation for our anniversary  and the hostess was very rude. Told my wife they were limited on space and 8 pm was the only time they had. When my wife asked for the table to be set with a nice bottle of wine. The host replied \"well you can tell your server, we need to make sure your 21. This turned my wife off from even wanting to purchase a bottle of nice wine for our celebration. When we got there the host were polite and seated us promptly. Our server seemed as if she didn't want to be there, she wasn't very interactive at all. Rarely smiled. Didn't really suggest anything, food or beverage wise. It was our first time there. So when the food came out, the presentation was phenomenal. But the food wasn't that great, we both maybe took 3 bites a piece. Maybe we just made a bad choice in what we ordered which is perfectly fine. So we had to flag our waitress down for another beverage. She never asked how everything was, she just asked if we wanted a Togo box which we both declined and she could see that our meals were barley touched but yet and still she doesn't ask if everything was okay. Overall other than the view of the city we both had a horrible experience. If we ever return it would just be for drinks and the view."}
{"text":"Cons: A bit pricey and slow/uneven service. (I ordered a drink and got it with dessert. Maybe cuz the main dish came out absurdly quickly?)
Pros: Friendly waitress, food. 

We got the potato chip nachos which would have been much better then less chips.  The mixture of the goat cheese, chives, and whatever else was in there was good.  It wasnt overwhelming taste wise on any one thing and the goat cheese was also mild (a good thing).  

Everyone got meats at the table and not a single bite was left.  I on the other hand got the lobster mac n cheese.  It was not anything like mac n cheese but that was actually better.  It was like a rigatoni ala vodka sauce with a tiny bit of the goat cheese hidden under plenty of pasta and huge chunks of roasted tomatoes and even huger chunkcs of lobster.  A very perfect portion.  Presentation was a bit careless but it made up in taste.  

Everyone around us was eating pizza that looked delish."}
{"text":"My husband and I along with two other couples dined at Fahrenheit Friday night celebrating Valentine's.  It was a terrible experience from beginning to end.  Waitress was surly from the no greeting beginning to not bringing a spoon for the soup. Had to flag down another waiter after waiting at least 10 minutes for her to return. Soup was cold and seriously over salted.   Our guest told another server that it was inedible.      No comment from server. He just took it away.  My \"Charlotte Nachos\" were cold.   Our guest's hamburger was not hot and her mashed potatoes solidified because they were so cold.   My husband had the lamb and said it was good but could have been hotter.   Another guest had the cauliflower side. She was disappointed and did not eat it.   Waitress never asked why we left our meals.   Truly unprofessional evening.  Last surprise---tip added to check.  Our server would have received NO tip. A pleasant server could have saved the evening."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I gave them a second chance. Last year they really dissapointed on numerous occasions with service and food quality. This year they seem to have gotten it together. The new menu items are awesome. The pork chop I had was delicious and all the appetizers I tried were great. My favorite change has been the desserts. I love the creativity that is going into the flavors. Happy I can go enjoy the amazing view without being grumpy about the service."}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of the other reviews here. An awesome view at night, but otherwise, more flash than substance when it comes to the menu. And you're definitely paying for the view when it comes to the menu. Valet is $7. We had a very nice calamari app. The short ribs were tasty but def not worth $39. Do NOT get the $32 ramen, its a waste of money. Your best bet is to come here for a burger and fries ($16) and enjoy the view. Service was below average. Overall: Great view, food is only decent for the price, service poor."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Fahrenheit. Being from Cleveland, OH ... I've been to the original Fahrenheit which is splendid. I was actually a little disappointed in the food.
 
I went with my wife during Charlotte's Restaurant Week to take advantage of the 3 courses for $30. The chicken wings confit were delicious, and had a GREAT flavor. The calamari was also awesome. I was very under-whelmed with the hanger steak entree. I understand they're busy during RW .. but you would think they'd want to serve exceptional food to make sure customers come back on a normal night. This was not the case, and I don't think I'll be back again for the food. 

The view is one of the best in Charlotte, but you definitely pay for it (literally ... you have to pay $10 to park in the hotel). Come here for a cocktail or two to enjoy the view before you head elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"I live in Waxhaw with my family and have been dying to make it to Farenheit for a while now. Myself and 3 other suburban mom's finally made it to celebrate one of our birthdays. Lynn Allen, the GM, made a fun and exciting night even better. Not only does the restaurant offer top notch views of the city, it offers exquisite food as well as impecable service. Our napkins were folded for us any time we got up from the table by the staff. Our glasses were never empty and our waiter offered great advice when we weren't sure what to order. We could have made a night out of Farenheit alone. We have already made plans to go back. Thank you again, Lynn, for helping us to celebrate and for making a night to remeber. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I had read about this place in a magazine but it didn't live up to the review.  

We arrived early & were seated right away.  We were on the opposite side of the kitchen & back a bit so while we could see the view, it wasn't great having to stare across other tables to look out.  The room was cold (turned out they sat us right under a vent) and it was so loud we couldn't hear the server nor could we talk.  

The meal was very quick.  No bread or time to enjoy the first round of drinks.  I had the lump crab pasta & my husband the tuna.  All I can assume is there was a big pot of pasta sitting in the kitchen that they dish from, because the meal came way to fast to have been cooked to order.  

The food was okay.  Portions were smallish.  We ordered dessert also,and left knowing we would be looking for a snack later in the evening.  Dessert was okay - they ran out of sherbet so my husband got vanilla ice cream.  I had the cobbler, which was less than stellar; it was a biscuit in the middle of a bowl of pie filling.  I think we were in and out of the dining room in less than an hour.  At this price point I expected a more leisurely, relaxed, custom prepared meal.  

The one positive I can say about Fahrenheit is the view from the patio.  We went out to the deck after eating for  a post-meal glass of wine.  The view of the city & the sunset were lovely.  It is windy, so if you get chilly easily (like I do) bring a sweater or wrap.  

In the future we may return just to have a glass of wine on the patio, but will not be returning for meals."}
{"text":"The experince started on a relatively on a good note with a good cocktail (Cosmonot).  However, it took a turn with the beef carpaccio- extremely salty.  The jumbo lump crab cakes are good too.  The marinated lamb was good; however, it was overloaded with McDonald's grade French Fries.  It also came with four pieces of sliced lamb- rather see more lamb than mediocre french fries.  The curry tuna had an overly peppery crust.  The steak was delicious, but that was it. The steak was the highlight; it seemed that the chef forgot about the rest of the dish: plain potatoes and asparagus.  The creme brulee was like any other creme brulee you could get at another gourmet restaurant.  However, the lava cake was delicious not overly sweet with the perfect vanilla ice cream to compliment.  The service was slow even though there were few tables. The waiter also forgot a salad and was a bit slower than other servers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I want to like Fahrenheit so much. The spectacular view, the amazing drinks and the modern decor gives so much potential to yield something astounding. Instead, Fahrenheit complements these incredible elements with less than mediocre cuisine.

I went to Fahrenheit for restaurant week and got Crisp Calamari for the appetizer, Slow-Braised Kobe Beef Short Ribs for the entree and Meyer Lemon & Marcona Almond Mousse for dessert, all of which sounded amazing but left so much to be desired. The calamari was overly breaded and oily. The slow-braised Kobe beef was extremely dry and hard. The noodles that came with the short ribs were basic lo mein noodles that you could easily get at a fast food Chinese take-out place with 1/4 the price tag and 1000% more flavor. The mousse was room temperature and fell apart to a creamy pudding. 

I would recommend coming here for drinks and the view, but don't waste your money on a luxurious price tag for a mediocre dining experience."}
{"text":"Nothing like restaurant week to give you an opportunity to try a fancy, expensive restaurant on the cheap. That's what the wife and I did along with another couple. I had looked at the menu and read the reviews good and bad, but we had to try it out for ourselves. The wife and I were running a little late, so our friends had a chance to get a drink and check out the outside patio and they reported enjoying both with the exception of the $12 for a Jim Beam on the rocks.

I think that there may be other parking options, but we chose to valet at the building itself, which was $7. That's the reduced price from $10 since we were eating at the restaurant. The elevator ride to the 21st floor was a quick and we finally made it to our table, which gave us a view into the kitchen and expediting area. The decor itself was nice but nothing really special. I didn't really get a sense of the bar area but it seemed popular. Once we ventured outside, after our meal, we got the sense of why Fahrenheit is special and it's definitely the views of Uptown from the outside patio deck. 

On to the food, they offered the full menu along with the $30 restaurant week menu, but everyone at the table opted for the 3 course offer. As appetizers, we covered 3 options at the table, mix green salad, sausage and biscuit, and the chicken spring rolls. All 3 offered offered great portion sizes, even the sausage and biscuit was almost entree size. Everyone was pleased at the table flavor wise. For entrees again, we covered 3 choices, king salmon, scallops and pork tenderloin. The chosen temperatures for the salmon and the pork were well executed and all plates came with good portions of accompanying side vegetables. The cauliflower was a great combo with the scallops as was the sweet potato and pork and again with the salmon and wasabi mashed potato. Everyone enjoyed all the flavors and agreed that the plates were very well balanced. Everyone further agreed that we look forward to a return visit. The only dessert option was a peach cake with vanilla ice cream which was a nice way to end the meal. As mentioned before, we did go hang out on the patio and see the view of the uptown skyline.

The main knock on the evening for me was the service which in my opinion was a little chaotic and clumsy at times. They were busy due to restaurant week, but I would expect a little better considering the quality of the food and price point. We got off easy due to the $30 menu, but Fahrenheit is definitely a special occasion place based on price. They do have bar bites I believe and some pizzas to share that could help you experience the food in a cheaper manner. We may just do that next time we visit."}
{"text":"I've had Yelp for years, and love food, a whole lot. I also have never written a review, though you can bet I have tried more than one local restaurant in every city I visit. Thoughtfully made and perfectly cooked food, comprehensive wine list with strong choices at different price points, beautiful view, and attentive service."}
{"text":"Went here for a drink, the view is amazing of the skyline. The drink I got was good and the pricing was on the more expensive side however you are paying for the ambiance. The fire alarm went off in the hotel. However,  not a single person moved from the restaurant. The staff didn't even come around and say that is was a false alarm. The only reason we found out is because we went to leave and the waitress came running over to make sure we paid our bill. That is the only reason we found out. If it had been a real fire I can't imagine what would have happened."}
{"text":"The view is amazing! I used open table to book a reservation. I walked in at least 5-10 mins earlier and was already headed to my seat! The waitresses are very good. They work as a team when the other is gathering other customers service! I had the perfect seat! The wine is great! The food is great. You don't get a lot if you are starving but it is definitely fulfilling!"}
{"text":"Giving this three stars based upon a company dinner.  I think the service was pretty good only because we were a large party.  The salmon was very good.  And the place is really nice inside, until people start arriving.  On a weeknight when one wouldn't expect it to be that busy, it was full and the noise inside the restaurant was deafening.  I've never been in a very high priced restaurant where the noise level was that bad.  You also have very limited parking options.  Either go with the valet parking or hike for several blocks.  I honestly would never go here for a \"date\" because there is no way you could carry on a conversation without shouting.  It was pretty shocking."}
{"text":"Paid $30 for two martinis and had to wait 20 minutes for a glass of water. Really??? Service was way off for these prices. Get with it people!!! Way too much competition in this city... just saying."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit's menu of entrees is focused mostly on hearty Midwest America fare with some Asian-inspired dishes and they are quite delectable.
But this review isn't about those. That's because my wife and I have found the list of appetizers so varied and delicious and the bar area emitting such a fun yet comfortable vibe that it's been some time since we made it through the first half of the menu or into the main dining room.
Whether it's been part of a bar-hopping excursion with Ginko's and other Tremont locales, or just wanting a lighter-yet-still-elegant meal, we've worked our way through most of the appetizers list over several visits.
The most recent time came Wednesday when we had our mainstay -- the Vietnamese Chicken Spring Rolls ($10) -- as well as the Seared Lamb Sliders ($11) and the Crispy Calamari Salad ($12.50).
The sliders caught our attention because of the Asian Pear Marmalade that came on it along with a Triple Cream Bree. It is a testament to Chef Rocco Whalen's talent that he could take that fruity marmalade and have it mimic the sweetness and bite of stewed onions tha naturally tops the burgers at other restaurants.
The calamari dish came with a heaping amount of fluffy, tender pieces that were a good canvas for the thick Thai sauce drizzled over it. After a couple of stabs with my fork I realized they had tweaked the dish slightly since the last time I was here. There was an actual vibrant green salad underneath all the golden-toasted calamari. The salad was good, too, but it just felt like two separate dishes.
The spring rolls were as savory as ever. Sliced into four wedges to reveal ground chicken, diners are meant to wrap them in lettuce leaves with slices of cucumber and pickled ginger and a dipping sauce.
With the cold weather, we added the Lava Cake dessert that came with vanilla ice cream. I had loved such a dessert 10-15 years ago when they first became trendy but had since moved on to other options. But this dish with its hot, thick chocolate insides has rekindled my interest.
Of course, add two drinks for each of us and our bill added up to over $100, similar to if we had gone the traditional dining room route. But the variety was worth it.
The only disappointment of the night was that one of my other favorite appetizers, the Lobster Roll, did not make the new menu. Sigh."}
{"text":"Views are breathtaking! It's a cool spot for drinks overlooking Uptown. Good for groups or date night. Very unique and/or romantic."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is my go to for a enjoyable upscale meal when I am craving innovative American fare. I went with family to celebrate my birthday recently and had excellent service, food, and company. The waitresses ensured our experience was impeccable and readily answered questions regarding food and drink selections. I ordered the miso salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes, which was excellent-a perfect dish for the warm weather. Others in my party had the steak, pork tenderloin, scallops, and pizza. I wish I had doctor's salary already to frequent Fahrenheit more often. Only complaint was the dimmed lighting that produced a haze over the restaurant admixed with the sunlight. Kudos to Rocco and his team!"}
{"text":"One of the few places in QC that you can get a delicious culinary meal late at night. Grilled Salmon w/ wasabi mashed potatoes was delicious and I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here this weekend with a few friends from out of town, mainly just to see the view of the city. Were were not disappointed. The view from that balcony is absolutely breathtaking. They have a great drink menu, with a lot of originality and variety. The drinks are as pricey as you'd expect at an upscale establishment, but they are worth the price. Service was fine, a little slow but not rude or unfriendly. 

I'm giving this a 4 stars based on their drinks, location, atmosphere and view. I haven't tried the food yet, but I will be going back to give the food a chance."}
{"text":"Would have a better perspective if I went on a nicer day, as I think what really makes this place is the view and the rooftop area.  I went here with a group of girlfriends for restaurant week, and the food was just OK.  Wasn't bad, wasn't life-altering, but satisfactory.  Again, maybe not representative of their normal fare, so willing to give it another shot in the spring when it's warm outside.  On a plus, our server was really funny and helpful, so no complaints there!"}
{"text":"Okay so I went on a date there and I had made reservations for 6 p.m. I arrived and they said that our table would be ready soon. Front of the house kept on changing and no one knew what was going on. After 45 minutes I and my other half at the time were finally seated. I was very irked because the whole concept of making reservations at a restaurant is so your table can be ready AT THE TIME YOU REQUEST IT. When we DID sit down, the food was also underwhelming and overpriced. The atmosphere was a little too loud for my taste. The only redeeming quality was the server."}
{"text":"Went for Brunch and it was amazing. Service and food were both outstanding. The view of the city is beyond spectacular. The ambiance is so delightful. I would love to see more menu options but overall it was a great experience. Next time we go will def be for dinner."}
{"text":"Went a few years ago for my birthday, I was underage at the time but was still able to really enjoy the rooftop! Wish I had pictures - the food was amazing, of course it was pricey for a rooftop in uptown Charlotte but you definitely get your money's worth with the quantity and quality!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Service is non existent. There is more security working here than wait staff. With so many great places to go in Charlotte don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Their short rib is an absolutely amazing asian noodle dish and the meat is perfectly tender. Their salmon dish is also out of this world. They have a great happy hour and even bring out bacon to guests to have with drinks. Their chocolate molten cake is heavenly and they bring it out with a firecracker if it is your birthday. I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a romantic dinner during Cleveland restaurant week.  For my three courses, I started with the Vietnamese Chicken Spring Rolls-Local Bibb Lettuce, Cucumber Salad, Hong Kong Dipping Sauce. For my entree I got the delicious Kobe Beef Short Ribs-Teriyaki Lo-Mein Noodles, Bok Choy, Roasted Mushrooms, Ginger, Soy-Apple Glaze. And I finished with Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Pot de Crème -Vanilla Custard, Chocolate Whipped Cream, Just Baked Cookie.  And I would eat that all again.

My husband thoroughly enjoyed his 3 course meal of the Fahrenheit House Salad - Greens, Carrots, Miso Dressing, Candied Cashews; Grilled 6 oz. Filet Mignon - Garlic Broccolini, Buttery Mashed Potatoes, Truffle Jur; and the Cookie Dough Pot de Creme.  

The only down side was the super slow service.  The kind where it looks like they forgot you were their table, 2 different times.  If only the service could match the food this would be a perfect 5 star kind of place."}
{"text":"Worst root top I've ever been to! No bar, no music, nothing romantic about the place!' Big fall! Went inside to get a glass of wine and was ignored, the place was dead, and I look the bartender right in the eyes and they still didn't ask me if I wanted a drink or if I needed help. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I'd say this place teeters between 3 and 4 stars, leaning closer to 3. For starters -- I heard about Fahrenheit after doing some research on good rooftop bars in Charlotte. Coming from NYC and being a rooftop afficionado, I was eager to see what the CLT skyline looked like. Fahrenheit does not disappoint. 

The layout of the venue is a bit odd, which is what made our time there awkward. There was a private party beginning at 7, but the party reserved four big areas of the relatively small venue, leaving very little space for anyone to sit down. The staff closed down those areas well in advance of the private party, so it just looked like there were a bunch of empty areas.

Ambiance itself was great. I enjoyed the overall vibe of the place. When I got there, I worried it would be a little pretentious, but much to the contrary. The staff was helpful if you reached out, although they didn't make much of an effort to go out of their way to be helpful. This was particularly unfortunate because, again, the layout of the venue is not entirely intuitive.

TIPS:
1) There are three or four small round tables that are first come-first serve, but no signage would indicate that. So if you're having trouble grabbing a seat at the bar, ask the hostess where the first come first serve seating is.
2)  There are three separate entrances to the outdoor area. But there aren't any signs that would indicate this. Take the time to peruse the whole spot before you settle on an outdoor area.
3) My boyfriend had the mezcal drink and I can't say we were thrilled about it. The Angel Aviation drink is made w/ gin and very refreshing.
4) Bring a jacket. They don't have operating heat lamps outside, so it will behoove you to bring something to keep warm."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago I called Fahrenheit to book a private dining party for 15 guests. I spoke to Mercury (unforgettable name): somebody would call me with the information. After a week I called Fahrenheit again. Mercury was unavailable so I asked to speak to somebody else. I was informed the dining room was too busy and someone would call back (lady on the line would not take my phone number because \"Mercury already has it\"). Well, two weeks have gone by and I am still waiting for Mercury to contact me. They must not need my business."}
{"text":"Such a gem to find in the Cleveland area. Absolutely delicious food! Nice atmosphere, though it was a little too dark even for my young-ish eyes. I had the filet... maybe one of the best I've ever had. Larger than average portion of meat. Another in my party had the swordfish and clams, said it was good but the broth that came with it was strange. Others had the lobster mac and cheese and black bass. We tried the warm green bean appetizer (very spicy), fried cauliflower (kind of bland), poke nachos (tuna was plentiful), and brussels sprouts (the best!). Would give 5 stars for food, but taking off 1 star for atmosphere & service. For the prices at this restaurant, I expected better service. Not that the service was bad, but there are some things you expect when you pay $30+ for an entree. For example, none of us were drinking wine, and our empty wine glasses we not removed off the table until we asked for them to do so. We didn't get bread until 25 minutes after ordering entrees. Another negative, though nothing to do with the staff, the floor is unsteady in some places and made our chairs wobble and vibrate when people walked past. None of these negatives would cause me not to return, as the filet alone speaks for itself. Overall, will be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try Fahrenheit for so long and my boyfriend and I decided to make reservations for 8PM on Saturday night. We ended up being sat around 8:30- which was fine because we ended up grabbing a drink from the bar. 
The service was terrible from the moment we sat down. Our server didn't come speak to us for about 10 minutes, he made us feel uncomfortable when we said tap water was fine, and didn't even ask if we wanted a new drink as ours were almost empty. We ordered new drinks and calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was fantastic by the way! However the cocktail my boyfriend ordered was not brought out until our entree was almost done and we had still yet to get any water. The server did not seem interested in us at all, but he did seem to like the tables surrounding us. It's too bad we ended up giving him a good tip because he definitely didn't deserve it. The only reason this is not getting less stars is because the filet and calamari we ordered was delicious. The filet was cooked as we asked and was tender as could be."}
{"text":"We came for dinner because this seems to be such a great place I on the other hand don't see what all the fuss is about , yes there is a beautiful view I'll give them that but the staff with the exception of the waitress I found them to be cold and very short when I asked a question as if I was bothering them as for the cocktails they were good.  The food I didn't find there stuffed lobster tail to be appetizing at all my husband had steak it was much better then mine the prices the charge are ridiculous I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"This place is probably now one of my favorites. The food was super delicious and the service was excellent. I got the tuna and rice dish and red velvet cheese--highly recommend both!!"}
{"text":"A local friend took us up to Fahrenheit for drinks and we ended up staying for dinner.  This place has a great view of the Charlotte Skyline.   

The atmosphere was more of a lounge with seating outside to enjoy the night.   We started off with the nacho fries and moved to our main courses.  Scallops, Pork Steak and Korean Bowl.   All of these items looked, smelled, and tasted great!   

This isn't great place for a drink and view of the city.  If you want to spend a bit more then go for the food as well!"}
{"text":"We were trying to figure out a place to eat a late lunch/early dinner and were told to come here. Unfortunate thing is, that every restaurant in this neighborhood opens at 5 and it was 4. We wandered and drove around and were the first people to arrive at 4:59pm. I loved that they had a little card at the hostess desk for you to take with all their social media channels. We had a really nice waiter. Nice, classy room. 

We did a bit of sharesies. I had a salad with ginger dressing that was delicious including pickled cucumbers. One of my favorite things ever. Great spot."}
{"text":"We, two of us, arrived on Saturday at 715pm on Mother's Day weekend and getting drinks was slow and we ordered food with the first beer. An hour and a half later I had to find the waitress, cancel the order, pay for drinks and leave. If you want to go there for the view and a beer, great. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to eat at to anyone but my ex wife:-)"}
{"text":"Was so excited to finally go after all the hype but was very disappointed.  41$ Steak was way undercooked and had to be sent back-still wasn't cooked right when it came back but hunger prevailed. $30 pork chop wasn't cooked either and was also sent back also returned still not cooked however my appetite checked out by that point so a little lukewarm rice turned out to be dinner.  Their short list of beer options was made shorter as they were out of 4.  So glad we bought the 85$ gift certificate for 45$ from the radio or not only would we have been hungry but would've spent way more than what it was worth."}
{"text":"Breathtaking views of the Charlotte skyline provide the backdrop for this fantastic restaurant. Every course was scrumptious. The dates stuffed with chorizo and wrapped in bacon were a decadent treat. The cucumber and avocado salad had an subtle Asian twist we a great"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Cleveland! Not only is the food amazing but the atmosphere makes it a destination for all occasions. I have been to Fahrenheit 3 times and have had wonderful experiences each time. 

The first two experiences were impromptu dinner plans. We did not make a reservation and were able to sit both times right away on Saturday night. We sat in the bar area but received a full size table with enough room to spread out and relax, not feeling cramped at the bar. As an appetizer lover I indulged in the Cleveland nachos and a pizza both times. Both of which are large enough to share! The nachos are cooked to perfection with a perfect amount of fondue and bacon atop. The pizzas are delicious. Having tried one each time I went, they are cooked using a dough thick enough to get crispy on the bottom but thin enough to not be too greasy and sickening. Drinks consisted of wine and Moscow mules. The mule menu is to die for and they definetly do not hold back on the alcohol. Prices are moderately high but if you order appetizers and pizza it is attainable.

The third trip was for a planned trip for a birthday and family get together. This time we were able to get the full 2 hour dinner experience the chef prefers. Our meal started with a pitcher of sangria that was delicious. I ordered the lemonade stand. It was very strong and was actually a martini, unfortunately the menu did not specify this or i would not have ordered. It however was also delicious. The Cleveland nachos were also ordered again. This time we needed them to be gluten free for a member of the group. The restaurant was able to accommodate us and gave the fondue cheese on the side so everyone could enjoy the chips. We then ordered the salad that was on special. This was a light mixture of spinach and quinoa.  Very fresh and filling. I went for the margarita pizza for dinner and it was the size of large pizza! Needless to say leftovers were taken home. The remainder of the group enjoyed different fishes, and lobster mac and cheese. The chef accommodated a birthday celebration and made a plate of all the gluten free dessert options available. Needless to say the experience was great and food pacing was perfect. The atmosphere is dimly lit but energetic. A must stop in Tremont and all of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Food is Good - the Bar is excellent and the view superb. 
I will come back in summer or spring."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting to do this so here i go. I love it here. Good atmosphere good drinks great food. Short rib on lo mein and i could eat this every day."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, food was to perfect in every way, service over the top.   We had the avocado appetizer which is excellent.  The walleye with risotto is over the top"}
{"text":"I love the small plate aspect of this restaurant. The views are incredible and I've never had a bad dish. Serving staff can be temperamental at times but overall I recommend this restaurant to family and friends visiting from out of town or looking for a nice date night in town."}
{"text":"Good variety on menu. We had an awesome waitress, Marlena, who made the experience there more enjoyable. For appetizer, we shared the grilled avocado. It was good with the accompanying bread, however, I wasn't totally impressed with it. I had a good seared tuna, pretty spicy, which I love, but would probably stay away if I didn't like spicy food, and I wasn't expecting that from the description. My date had the Korean short ribs which were amazing and very rich. Very tender. However, we both would have preferred rice instead of the noodles. All in all, it was a great dining experience. Will dine again in the future."}
{"text":"Food as mediocre, service was slow and not friendly. We had very high expectations and simply put: it sucks."}
{"text":"This could be a restaurant week unique experience - but I can't give them the review I was hoping for. I used Open Table to book a group of 8 for a business dinner. I had someone with us from out of town and wanted to give them a great view of the city and a great meal.

So first, the good:

1) The bar was great, I loved the tables and the view and the atmosphere there
2)  The caramel apple martini.
3) The view (in the bar and main dining area)

Now, the reason for the MEH review:

We were not seated in the main dining room. We were put in a bland room with nothing but other large groups.  The noise became unbearable and no one could hear anything because all these large groups/parties were seated all together in a box like room with very little atmosphere and no music or ambiance. 

The servers were so stressed out from R-Week that they got a bunch of our order wrong and kept bringing and dropping off items we did not order. I have no idea who didn't get the items, because they never came back for them to correct the order - we were only offered the Queen's Feast menu and had to ask several times for the regular menu - the items we ordered from that were good, but we got more of them than we ordered. I think for some reason they added one extra of each app we ordered. 

Only half way through dinner did I realize on my own that there was a special wine list for R-week on the table. No one let us know this before we started ordering wine for the table - the special menu was behind some other items and not really obvious - so i was a little miffed that they didn't call our attention to the promotion when they asked us what we wanted to drink.

I was really disappointed that I didn't get to enjoy the real ambiance and menu. I wasn't happy about paying over 700.00 for a lack luster evening. I am not cheap when it comes to fine dining - but I do demand a good experience. Unfortunately, I had no idea it was R-week and wasn't going out for that reason - so it was less of a positive thing for me and my group.

I will probably try the bar sometime in the future... I did enjoy the caramel apple cocktail."}
{"text":"Imagine a chili's with more expensive ingredients but the same quality of cooking and an over-priced menu. Service is mediocre, food is mediocre, you're just paying for the view.  It's like the owner of the hotel gave this awesome restaurant location to a relative with no restaurant experience or taste... actually I think that's exactly what happened"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC view! However, food is just mediocre compared to what you'll pay. Just go up for the bar and the view if you can!"}
{"text":"The experience itself was a bit disappointing...

Visited Charlotte for the first time and wanted to check out Fahrenheit because of the view and the menu looked great. I personally have worked as a server in 5 star restaurants in the past so I was expecting the service to be very good. Don't get me wrong I understand that things happen but this was just disappointing. 

First off, we were seated without a drink menu. It would be one thing if we were only sitting there for a minute or so but we waited 10 minutes before even being greeted and watered. When we were offered a drink menu and finally able to order our drinks it took another 10 minutes for them to be delivered.

Second, after waiting a while for drinks we asked if there were any specials... to sum it up if you are serving dinner in a nice restaurant such as this... know your specials by heart, do not read them. When you don't know them it comes off unprofessional.. 

Also noted was the servers change in attitude when my boyfriend ordered they most expensive dish on the menu...

We arrived and were seated at 7:45 and my drink order was not taken care of until 8:10, that is a LONG time and we almost considered leaving. Finally the dinner order was put in at 8:22. 

The rest of the evening was fine. The view here is magnificent and the dinner was fantastic. Dessert was equally as good. My boyfriend and I are not snobs but we do like and know good food and good service. The food and the view, plus the pleasant experience from other waitstaff who were not taking care of us is the reason for the 3 stars. Would consider going back with the hopes that the next time would be different/better."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday because he's been dying to go here. We went during brunch and dinner (our hotel was in the same building). Brunch time was great. Great music, food and drink. We came back for dinner and our waiter was Chris. He was freaking awesome!!! Was so polite about everything. We didn't have to ask him to refill our drinks. He wasn't hovering over us about the food. The table we sat at had a beautiful view of the city of Charlotte. We first ordered calamari as our appetizer. It was ok. More on the salty side. Then I ordered the wedge salad and my boyfriend ordered the avocado salad. We ended up switching because I LOVED his salad. FREAKING DELICIOUS!!! Then our entrée came out. I had the salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes and my boyfriend had the braised short ribs with lo mein. AMAZING!!! My salon was on point. The best salon I have ever had. The wasabi mashed potatoes made it even better. My boyfriend LOVED his short ribs. It just fell apart and melted in your mouth and the lo mein was soft and not chewy. We were ready to check out and when we were getting our check back, they came out with a plate that said happy birthday and a piece of cake (which was great too!!!) with a candle on it. They ABSOLUTELY took care of us. We loved it sooo much. Thank you so much Chris!!! Make sure to ask for him when you guys dine there."}
{"text":"So it should be a 4.5 rating.
I went to Fahrenheit on 3/6/2017 for their restaurant week menu. I sat at the bar area and my bartender is very informative.
Ok about the food
First start: Lobster roll. Bread is toasted nicely and there is a decent amount of lobster meat. Not much mayo which is good since others add way too much mayo and overwhelm the taste of lobster. I would like to add a little bit of lemon juice on it to make it more refreshing (personal preference)
Main course: Famous dish-- the short ribs. So disclaimer: NO KOBE BEEF of course since if you know there are only limited number of restaurants which have direct import of Kobe beef and none of these restaurants located in Cleveland, sorry. 
Yet they actually have a good quality of Wagyu, which is from Snake Hill Fram (search it and you know this farm provide pretty decent American Wagyu meat)
So the short rib is taste good. It is fork tender and the meat is cook just right. Full of meat favor and the fat just give another layer of taste. The mushroom noodle is ok. Noodle absorbs too much sauce and make it a little bit salty. I would like to have yaki soba, soba or udon to replace the lo mein.
Dessert I choose the passion fruit dessert. Sweet finish. Big portion. Enjoyable experience.
I also have a chance to try their brisket ramen. (Yes brisket ramen, not roast pork). Crunchy layer for the brisket and again a thin layer of fat gives a ton more of favor. Noodle and the broth: broth is sour since they add Apple vinegar to the broth in order to open eaters appetite. Good try and good turn out. 
Definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"The view is spectacular but the service is anything but.  Four of us went here for drinks before dinner.  The drinks were slow to arrive, they were mediocre at best and the waitress, who I will not name, seemed bothered.  We will go back but only for pictures."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly and the atmosphere is great. If you get a table by the window or a seat facing the window it is even better! 

As for the food I can't say anything great. Most dishes sound good and appear \"fancy\" and we ordered a number of the \"absolute favorites\" and they were all average or below in my opinion. 

*The salad was basically a heaping pile of lettuce without much on it but a little drizzle.
*The lobster Mac n Cheese was pretty dry and didn't have a lot of flavor. 
*The spare rib was super fatty, low quality meat.
*The ribeye special was dry and pretty bland. 

In my opinion you pay for the view and that's about the only thing special that this place has. Give me another rooftop in Charlotte and I'll likely have just about no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Strongest happy hour menu I've seen. Interesting and inventive ingredient combinations throughout full menu (e.g., my date's Coffee and Mustard Crusted Pork Tenderloin), which all seem to work. Walleye dish was superior, as good or better than I have had at the top seafood-oriented restaurants in town. Very positive experiences."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit could be a special place that has a stellar view and top notch menu. Delivery of these services was a challenge during our last visit on 2/8/2017. While the local favorite Charlotte Nachos was a hit, the entrees were average quality. One steak was sent back and it's replacement comp'ed on the final check due to no flavor. The charges were not made correctly resulting in calls to the card company to correct. 

One member (who had the twice served steak) exclaimed they do not plan to return to the establishment."}
{"text":"The only reason it gets one star at all is because of the view and outside decor which you can't beat but unfortunately I was unable to enjoy any other experience due to rude staff and service. I had just drove 7 hours from DC and my friends who grew up in Charlotte wanted to make sure I saw the best parts. They had mixed reviews with Fahrenheit in the past but because of the view insisted we go. As we walked in the inside decor was lacking but when you step outside it is breathtaking. While one of my friends ordered drinks at the bar my friend was leaning over one of the railings to show me something and not even 5 seconds later he was being slammed on the ground and then against the wall by a bodyguard 3 times his size. They then kicked him out without letting any of us speak to him or them. I understand he shouldn't be leaning on the railings on top of a skyscraper but a simple \"sir can you get down\" would suffice. He wouldn't have argued or fought back but they didn't even give him a chance before physically and aggressively harming him. After, I went to find my friend at the bar to tell them what happened and he said the entire bar staff had been rude to him and we still hadn't been served drinks he ordered. I asked the bartender to cancel our order and she smirked and said too late and tossed them on the bar I took one sip and it was disgusting anyways and way over priced. It's sad I didn't even get to enjoy any food, drinks, or the atmosphere since we were only there for a tops 15 minutes. I understand why there was barely anyone in there for a Friday night since according to other reviews on here and Facebook they treat all their customers this way. Almost ruined my trip to Charlotte and put a bad taste in my mouth but luckily we went to the Ritz Carlton and they changed my view on this beautiful southern city. Stacey was the name of the bodyguard and he should be fired or at least taught some manners before physically assaulting someone."}
{"text":"The service at this place was by far the worst we have ever had. Not only did we we wait a half hour for drinks, but no food items or beverages were comped. This place dropped the ball on executing a simple procedure and then failed to makeup for it.

Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Shirty service and service manager ignores the busy bar to make drinks for tables. Can't believe they let Lindsey work solo on a holiday weekend. Thankfully she is leaving."}
{"text":"The staff, from the hostess to management, feel that they are doing you a huge favor by allowing you to be in their presence. The uppity snootiness is palpable immediately after you step off the elevator. Look around guys. Charlotte is a far cry from NYC so get over yourselves. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"The view of Uptown is spectacular! I loved the decor of the restaurant and the outdoor seating. I did have some service issues when I visited for brunch (my server didn't greet me until I had been sitting for 10 minutes). The food was great and the mimosa was also tasty! I would have liked more attention to service for a 5 star review."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a rooftop bar/lounge area with fire pits that overlook the city (perfect to watch the sunset)! We went with a large group of girls and ordered bottles of champagne with dinner. Dinner was good but not amazing. I would recommend the margarita pizza, small plate of shrimp and boa short rib sandwiches. I loved the ambiance about this place more than the food however. I would recommend trying it out if you're looking for dinner with a view."}
{"text":"I went there with 10 friends for birthday dinner. The waitress was OK, not great. The food was OK, not great. It was really loud and felt like a banquet hall and the prices definitely aren't worth what you get.  I will probably not go back unless I have guests in town and want to show them the view of uptown."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here on my birthday and it has become one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I had the short rib lo mein and she had the salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes. Both were delicious. The service was pretty good, we had a seasoned waitress who was training a new waiter. He seemed a little nervous but was trying. The atmosphere was just as good as the food, upscale but intimate."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is an upscale dining experience located on the 21st floor.

When we arrived parking was limited because a vehicle stalled directly in front of the garage entrance so we had to find street side parking. This was a fluke so no dings to the restaurant for this.

Once we parked we walked to the entrance or what was labeled as such and the door was locked. Remember this building also houses condos. This was off putting because we had to wait to be let in by people exiting.

Once we arrived to the restaurant we were quickly greeted and seated. When I booked our reservation I asked for a window seat but this was not where we were placed. Nevertheless we had a nice view.  

The waitress and staff were EXCELLENT! and attentive. Definitely 5 stars. The decor and setup of the restaurant/bar are 5 stars.

The food unfortunately was Mehhh. I am not sure why the food is raved about here but I was not impressed. It is a solid 3 but nothing more. The appetizer we ordered (lamb-cumin meatballs) were DRY!! NO MOISTURE.  My entree was cooked right (Ginger soy Salmon) but was oversauced which is my pet peeve. My husbands Snapper was dry and tough. Finally, we took a chance and ordered dessert. I mean it was our Anniversary dinner after all but that was disappointing as well. We ordered the carmelized banana bread pudding and received bananas that were not caramelized. I posted the pictures of the bananas. Additionally, the bananas had a strange aftertaste which led us to believe it was mingling with a vegetable or another fruit.

Ok here's the verdict!!!

Will I return ??? YEP FOR DRINKS ONLY

Is it worth a visit??  ABSOLUTELY

The 3 stars is for the food only. The experience overall was good."}
{"text":"Rating for the happy hour. Who doesn't love free bacon! The food is great the drinks are great. Awesome deal."}
{"text":"Delicious! The lobster rolls tasted like I was in New England and the dates were insane. We had hanger steaks, scallops, halibut and the king crab ramen for dinner, yum! It is pricey but worth if  - especially the pop rock chocolate!"}
{"text":"Two out of three ain't bad. Food was absolutely delicious and presentation was perfect and added to the dining experience. View are the best in Charlotte. However I should take away more stars because the service was bad, really just felt ignored, however I am giving it the benefit of the doubt because I don't think it was intentional, none the less, spent almost 200 for just two people and felt that we we not a priority."}
{"text":"Love the vibe and the view!  Prices are a little steep, but if you have a drink and maybe an app it won't break the bank too badly.  Definitely a Charlotte must :)"}
{"text":"Closing time is 11pm on a Thursday. *eye roll* Of course you're just paying for the view."}
{"text":"Food was not tasty. Either too salty or too sweet. Soup was not good. Here for a birthday party which was ruined due to server dropping calamari on the birthday girls and guests. Service was terribly slow. Desert was ok but selection was not. Would not come again."}
{"text":"My wife daughter and i went here for our 25th wedding anniversary excellent food nice portions. Wait staff were very knowledgeable, the only thing that would keep me from going back is the place is extremely Loud. I like a Quiet atmosphere!!! Especially for an anniversary dinner!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a better review but customer service means so much to me. We were in from out of town to celebrate my birthday weekend. Went on line to make reservations the night before our visit. Their website is garbage...there is an option to make reservations on line, however when you select the on line reservation function you are directed to the Cleveland location. It was very frustrating and I couldn't get anyone on the phone for Charlotte. So I made the reservation hoping it was just a computer glitch. Next day (day of our reservation) I called the Charlotte venue explained the situation to whoever answered. She was the worst...\"we are all booked and there is nothing I can do.\" That is all she would say. Eventually I got a manager on the phone. She attempted to be helpful...could not accommodate the original reservation time but did get a table for us around 9. She however seemed to not be concerned at all about the computer issue that I explained other than to say we've been booked for a day. The restaurant is very nice. I could tell that they set up tables to accommodate overflow and that made the place seem tiny and extremely crowded. I felt like too close to the party behind me. The atmosphere is overall nice. The food is very good...we did have a ridiculous wait time for our entrees. The appetizer was served promptly. Our waiter was nice...but she wasn't very attentive. She had way too many tables that were spread too far apart. Drinks average...a little watered down. Lamb chop sliders EXCELLENT. Rib eye steak AMAZING. The Pad Thai just ok def not enough shrimp. Would I return, yes I just hope the next experience is better."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Fahrenheit. First one was a few years back and I don't recall what I ate. I stopped in for just a drink after shopping but I saw someone eating the grilled avocados. They looked very good so of course I had to try them. I ate all three halves. They were outstandly delicious!  I'm looking forward to my next trip to Cleveland because I plan to go for dinner. Great ambiance and energy during their happy hour...Lots of friendly faces and the food looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful view! The Coffee Moscow Mule is delicious! Grab a seat outside and enjoy a great time with friends!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was less than impressed. Customer service was non-existent and I paid $30 for two glasses of Chardonnay..... Cheap Chardonnay at that, I was just so shocked by the lack of effort put forth by the staff. I truly believe that if the customer service was up to par you would make a difference in the customer experience. You're paying for the view basically. Hope management makes the necessary improvements, I can certainly see the potential of this location."}
{"text":"The food is just as amazing as the ambiamce.  I have to say my husband and I don't normally go to restaurants with an upscale stigma due to the fear of not having large portions as well as large price Tag but...BUT the portions were just right , like down to a science and the manager lynn was so nice, she really put a personal touch into the service here.  We would definatly be back.  I can't wait to take our 2 friends out for a celebratory dinner which is comming up, and you can bet it will be here"}
{"text":"The view is ultimately what you pay for because the food is worth half of the price it is listed. Was it bad? No. Was it worth the price? Absolutely not. On top of the food quality the service was less than friendly. If I am paying this kind of money I except the server to be somewhat friendly rather than snobby and disinterested."}
{"text":"The food was good. Highly recommend the egg roll appetizer. Steak was very tender and flavorful. Sweet potatoes under the steak were over seasoned in my taste. Although, service wasn't all that great. It was my first time visiting and the waiter seemed drained... He had no emotions whatsoever. What keeps this restaurant in business is obviously the scenery."}
{"text":"We went to eat there with friends on  Saturday evening before a concert. We were there around 615 and we were able to get seats right away. I felt the hostess was very attentive and the waiter came right over. The wine list was on the small side for that type of high end restaurant but we tend to like bargains and don't drink high end when we go to restaurants. We save that for home. TIP :  They serve their wines by the glass by the bottle. You have to ask. So we got a Hahn Cab for $34. Like we said we are cheap. Lol. 

Anyway, the 4 of us ordered Two appetizers and two entrees. We got the meat/cheese plate $12 which I thought was a nice amount. The lobster rolls were really good. 
For entrees, we ordered the coffee crusted pork tenderloin with mashed sweet potatoes and they got the lamb roast. 
I thought the pork tenderloin was the best. 

Overall I was very impressed with the food and service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a family dinner and was very impressed with both the food and service. Everyone enjoyed their entree and we were well taken care of all night. Valet parking is available, and street parking is hard to come by. Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"From start to finish, this was a great meal.  Appetizers were awesome, even delivered to us bespoke ones like ahi tuna with caviar on shrimp chips and potato hushpuppies.  Short ribs were the best I have ever had.  Lobster mac and cheese was like penne alla vodka -- unbelievable.  French toast brioche for dessert was the best I have ever had in Charlotte.  Go.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness you guys... Fahrenheit has brunch now! And let me tell you: it is the brunch we've all been waiting for! 

A group of us went today to try it out and we were definitely not disappointed. I would recommend getting there before noon since that's when it gets busy. We arrived at 11 and were seated promptly. 

The brunch menu is short, sweet, and full of goodness. They have build-your-own Bloody Marys which a few of the people in my group got.  They came out in huge glasses piled high with toppings (bacon, olives, shrimp, you name it), and the rest of us stuck with mimosas and bellinis.  The white pear is amazing! They're all made with purée and not just Julie cocktails so they have an extra sweetness to them.

As far as the food menu goes, I literally wanted one of every single thing on it. They have fried chicken Benedict (which a few of my friends got and licked their plates), captain crunch pancakes (omg how can you go wrong?), smores waffles, and of course bacon.  I ordered the breakfast nachos and was greeted with an actual pile of potato chips with bacon, cheese, and eggs on top. Holy cow it was huge! Delicious too! My fiancé got a chocolate croissant with his 1/2 pound of bacon and breakfast potatoes (he's really weird about breakfast food), and I had a few bites of that- delicious! 

All in all, I will definitely be back for brunch! I'm already compiling a list of the next things o want to try!"}
{"text":"If you are all about the food then Fahrenheit can likely be all about you.  I enjoyed my meal completely and could say it was among the best I'd ever had. 
If you like dining in the dark, a server with a tired fast food worker attitude, staff exhibiting an intolerance for 2 of a party of 4 being 7 minutes late, being pushed to place your order, no considerate chat from your server regarding menu choices and being asked by the maître d' to pay your check 10 minutes after you decline to have desert(and just about 2 hours from all being seated at the table) so that a new party can be seated then by all means Fahrenheit can be a perfect choice for you. If indeed these features appeal to you then I would like to join you at Fahrenheit sometime for some interesting conversation and a meal cuz you must be a fascinating being. 
The topper for the night came when upon our hurried exit one of our party chose to engage the maître d' over our brash treatment. Among several points was a query as to what might have occurred had we each chosen a dessert and after dinner drink?  The curt response from this lovely servant of Whalen?  We would have been asked to move our gathering to the bar! Nice. 
We will not be gathering here again.  Meal quality like Fahrenheit has offered up for a good stretch in CLE is available in many nearby restaurants. Fortunately, so is polite and professional service."}
{"text":"Lazy waiters can ruin a great view...the food was mediocre, definitely not worth the price. We split the kobe beef ribs app and the burger.  The beef ribs were great but the burger wasnt worth the 15$ it cost. The waiter refilled our drinks 1 time the 1.5 hours we were there and only after we asked. Being friendly is normally a go to for waiters but not here. Go to Blue or Capital Grill instead."}
{"text":"Love the ambience, large fire pit on the patio, and if it wasn't a foggy night I am sure the view would be great.  Service was good. Skip the lobster rolls; only claw meat, mostly celery, bland, and stuffed into some strange croissant type roll, that was dry and over powered the small amount of lobster that was present.  Pizza was good, I was delightfully surprised. The chorizo wrapped date appetizer was a home run. Wouldn't be in a rush to go back... But I would suggest it being a great destination for a night cap on a date night."}
{"text":"We also live in the building and we went to the soft opening.  We each tried a different entrée and my beef shanks with grits was very tasty and cooked perfectly.   My son's rib eye was well flavored;  however, it was a little overcooked.  Another of my boys had the mac and cheese and he said it was quite good.  My wife had the scallops and they could have been cooked a tad longer.  The salads were excellent.  My wife and I are both fans of local brewed beers and they have a nice selection there.  The service was excellent and the views are  the best in town.  Given that we were at the soft opening, I fully expected a few of the dishes to be off a little and I have no doubt that Rocco will have everything running smoothly shortly.  This will be the premier restaurant in Charlotte.  With the great food and the views, it will be tough to top."}
{"text":"Amazing views and the pork tenderloin was awesome, but I did not love the waiter and it was SO LOUD. My boyfriend and I could hardly hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Ate there last night.  The city views are great, but that is the best thing about the place.  The food is okay for an upscale restaurant, but there are better options nearby.  The menu is limited and not impressive. The wait staff is hit or miss, mostly miss.  Service was inconsistent. Our waitress forgot about our desert order for about 15 minutes.  The valet also lost my car and it took them about 20 minutes to find it. Overall, go there for a drink and the views, but go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Great location- view - ambiance

Margherita pizza was great to share

One side of the restaurant was extremely warm- moved seats - other side of the restaurant freezing"}
{"text":"I have lived in both LA and Chicago and this place is amazing.   Just delicious and server was sooo nice. Love it here."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for a few cocktails prior to a musical event.

The bacon on the bar during happy hour truly IS delightful, but nothing could prepare me for the bacon wrapped dates. They were delicious. I could have probably eaten them for the rest of the night and been completely content.  Somehow, I managed to restrain myself. 

I also had the mussels, which were also delicious.  They were sautéed perfectly, the sauce was not too oily and not overpowering.

The bartenders were attractive and funny, they paid us lots of attention, hand squeezing fruits, and muddling cocktails carefully even though the restaurant was slammed. 

Wonderful atmosphere, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a little get together with some friends and it was terrible. They were really busy with a private party and regular customers but didn't have enough staff so wait time for drinks and food was long. Then when our food finally came, it was AWFUL. They are very pricey but that's ok if the food's worth it. Wouldn't have spend 5 dollars on anything here. I got the BLT salad and Queen Ramen. Both terrible. The view of the city and the set up of the restaurant was absolutely beautiful so I'd go back just for that and nothing else. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing overall. The hype was huge and not one bit of the experience held up to what I expected. In summary it felt like a hotel restaurant(ironic the building  is now a hotel) without the constancy  of good food. Oh did I mention it will cost you double what it should? Should be a 1 star, but the views are nice so I'm going with a 2.

Service - Sat for 3-5 minutes with many servers walking past us with no acknowledgement. Finally our server shows up to take our drink order. Don't see him for another five minutes and then returns with no drinks. Starts to explain the appetizers, but fumbles up what ingredients or items are available multiple times. Put in the recommend appetizer that was suggested. It came out amazingly fast, but wait where are my drinks? Oh there they are.. after 15 minutes of sitting. Keep repeating this with every course - slow, doesn't know the menu, etc. I didn't even get to order a second round.

Food - Appetizer was okay, but nothing special considering it was $22. Girlfriend and I are huge steak fans so she went with the Sirlon with Au jus. I went with the more expensive bone in aged steak. Her steak was cooked as requested(medium rare.) My steak was a mix of well done and uncooked? The outside was some what charred while the center was purple. Both tasted bland and just did not impress either of us. The mashed potatoes were good.. actually they were the best part of the entire experience! 

Save yourself a large sum of money and just do drinks to see the view. Go eat at all the better restaurants in uptown 4 times with the money you will save on a meal here.   

I still feel ripped off - diners remorse? That's a first for me."}
{"text":"While the food was great and the view was amazing the customer service was horrible. I work uptown and made the reservations for our 1 year anniversary a month ahead of time. I was highly disappointed. Our waitress was not attentive, she rarely checked on us, she put in a order for a wrong dish that was delivered (which had pork in it and we couldn't eat).....never did she apologize or anything. Unfortunately I will not be returning or recommending to anyone. We looked forward to this all day and the tables surrounding us shared in agreement the service was poor. The food was good. We had the halibut and lamb. Along with the chicken confit."}
{"text":"Best service ever. The food was amazing.  Jasmine is an awesome server!  Chris Danko, the manager, is one of the best managers I have ever encountered at a restaurant.  He went above and beyond for us.  The view is beautiful.  Blown away!"}
{"text":"This review has been way overdue so I apologize. I went here with my family for my birthday dinner back on July 23 so it was a Monday, so there wasn't really a crowd but we made reservations anyway. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the hostess  and I was seated right away. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and encouraging so it made us want to order more. 

Inside it's a contemporary yet trendy place of furniture. Dining tables had white tablecloths and in the back, they have this area where they had all these pretty pillows. Artsy with booth style sitting, yay! 

For drinks, I had their Cucumber Martini which had if I can remember correctly, gin, champagne and cucumber. It was a nice subtle drink for that hot summer day. Not too sweet and not too strong, just right. For dinner, we all ordered a variety of entrees. I had their korean short rib which was uber delicious. Tender beef with some noodles really hit the spot for my hungry tummy. Other dishes were their pork medallion which was okay according to my grandma, the pork was overcooked but the sweet potatoes was good though; and lastly, their beef rigatoni - too much going on in that dish. There were peas, carrots, big pasta noodle logs and chunks of beef. It looked like a pile of hamburger helper in a dish. To me, that's not a dish worth $23. 

Maybe my family ordered the wrong items but to be honest, there wasn't really much to choose from their menu. The only good tip I have is the on Mondays, they have 1/2 price wines"}
{"text":"The best thing about it was the view! It's pretty pricey. The food was decent. Probably would return if someone else was paying. Lol!"}
{"text":"Great place! Had the wild salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes. Very original and delicate. Great salad as well. Beautiful setting and reasonable prices considering value. Next eve met Devin, Dominic and Christian who work the kitchen there. Very passionate and talented young men. These folks were very genuine and passionate about their careers. Chef Rocco should be grateful to have folks so committed to what they are doing in his kitchen. I highly recommend this restaurant. Nice mixture of delicate and original preparations, attentive staff and nice settings. Go!"}
{"text":"I seriously had high hope for this place. I was sadly ultra disappointed. I had planned  a great night out for my girlfriends bachelorette party and was looking forward to having great drinks, yummy food, and spectacular service. 

The first problem was we sat at our table for 20 mins before we even had a waiter take our drink order. Next it took him another 20 mins to get our drinks and then he forgot mine, so by this point I think I waited 45 mins to even get a drink

Next was dinner. I ordered the pizza and it was fine, nothing to really brag about but was over priced. 2 of the girls just didn't care for their food at all and just couldn't eat it. The server was friendly and got them something else. The server even communicated that they could keep their meals because they were just going to throw the food away anyways. 

The bill comes and the server charged the girls for both meals! The service manager was brought over and was the RUDEST person I have ever encountered. He stated they should have to pay for both meals because they kept both. When my friend said the only reason we kept both was because the sever TOLD US TO! At that point things were heated and my friend being mature and didnt want drama at the table, asked the manager to step aside to talk. He then proceeded to yell at her and was so rude that she was brought to tears! He finally took one of the meals off but told us we could NEVER do that again. Like we would come back there anyways.

The ONLY saving grace of this place was the manager LynnAllen. She was very understanding, apologetic, and friendly. She made us feel so much better and we appreciated her very much, she definitely didn't have to come over but went above and beyond to ensure the night at this establishment ended on a better note."}
{"text":"Our food was very tasty, but the atmosphere in this place is just weird. It seems like it should be upscale seeing as how they have $30+ entrees, but when we left I felt like I had been in a bar all night. It is SO LOUD in this place that our table of four had to shout the whole night and it was stil hard to hear. What doesn't help is the crazy loud music that is piped in everywhere. Maybe if they would turn the music down a bit the crowd noise wouldn't have to reach such an annoying level. Sorry but I don't want to shout over the Black Eyed Peas while I eat my filet."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Management conspires with employees to make this place the least customer friendly place I've ever been. I will NEVER come here again because of the poor quality of employment and management. If you expect to be treated like a human being, I'd strongly suggest somewhere else."}
{"text":"This review is for happy hour, it doesn't get much better than this!  Can we say free bacon, as a starter....yum.  Who wants peanuts or chex mix, when you can have bacon!  I proceeded to order shrimp tacos, parmesan truffle fries and a red sangria.  The sangria was freshly made, fruity and tasty.  The shrimp tacos (2), were full of plump shrimp, greens garnish, a little bit of salsa and lime mayo in freshly grilled tortillas.  The fries were hot, cooked perfectly, and coated with lots of parmesan and just a touch of truffle oil.  The service was great, I can't wait to return for dinner!"}
{"text":"Curious to see more of CLT's skyline, we ventured to Farenheit to check out their rooftop bar. It did not disappoint. WOW!! It was breathtaking! I would even go as far as to say that their view is better than the new, swanky rooftop bar down the street, Merchant and Trade's. Personally, I think there is more of a \"view\" here. Plenty of areas for a great scenic photo op. Nice, large fire pits. Not much seating outside, though. If it weren't so cold and windy that day, we would have stayed longer to enjoy the view.

I knocked off two stars for their drinks. My SO and I ordered a cocktail each and our total bill came to $30+! He ordered an old fashioned and I a pineapple upside down cake martini. They were good and strong, but definitely not worth the price. We stayed to finish our drinks and then left. 

I am however, intrigued by their menu. Enough to consider returning to try their food. The restaurant was pretty busy for a Saturday before Christmas. The two places we went to before making our way here were slow. More people arrived when we left around 10pm. Plus, the staff was friendly. We took an uber both ways, so I can't speak for the parking situation."}
{"text":"Bartenders are short and snippy if you aren't spending enough money for them. I've been quite surprised by the attitudes of the staff on multiple occasions. The view is the best thing F° has going for them."}
{"text":"Don't bother trying them for restaurant week. They only honor the promotion Mon - thurs. Very lame."}
{"text":"Decent food & atmosphere but the clientele & that staff is both snobby & unpleasant. I wouldn't recommend going here underdressed or without plenty of cash & a platinum card. Valet parking was nice & Chef Rocco has a Great menu but the stuck-up attitudes were over the top & not worth the aggravation. I'll pass & find someplace else with a view & an overpriced menu for drinks & dinner."}
{"text":"So this is a tough review... I hate giving mediocre ratings, but I'm going to do my best to explain why I feel that this restaurant only deserves three stars.  Point blank, the only reason it got three is because of the view.

My disclaimer is that we did eat here during restaurant week.  I asked one of our waiters if he was overwhelmed because of how many people were there and he said no, that they had about 400 people on the books tonight (Wednesday) but that on the weekends it's closer to 600.  He said, \"if I'm not crying I'm doing okay\" -- haha... (insert terrified face here).

PROS:
* The view cannot be matched.  Seriously, you should go there just to get drinks and watch the sunset.  Absolutely breathtaking - and they even have their own garden on the terrace!
* Our waitress was very sweet, not the most attentive person, but still very nice.
* The mixed drinks looked great!

CONS:
* We made reservations for 9pm, showed up 30 minutes early to get a drink and take in the view and we still didn't get seated until 9:25pm.
* As a follow up to the previous bullet they tried to put us at a table literally next to the back kitchen door that was in front of a drink station so we couldn't see outside (WHAT) - so I asked if we could move over at least one table so we were not in the kitchen.  They obliged... but what made me mad is that there were other tables open by the windows!  If you are a restaurant known for your view you should seat people as close to the window as possible at all times!  Common sense here.
* The food - listen, I know it's restaurant week and you are very busy... but you only give people three options - so you should be able to whip up those three options with   accuracy, grace and beauty fairly quickly.  The food was downright not good.  I got the fried goat cheese appetizer (which is an enormous plate of baby arugula, one decent piece of fried goat cheese and a few bits of pistachio brittle, extremely dry croutons and some tart cherry jam (not impressive).  More is not always better, especially when it comes to lettuce (this is a theme with this place - stay tuned).  My second course was the King Salmon - wasabi mashed potatoes, blood orange, saikyo miso, and pickled cucumbers  My BIGGEST issue was the fact that they put mixed green lettuce between the hot potatoes and hot salmon so it wilted (gross) and I had to pick it all off.  The second issue was the complete overload of sauce.  The cucumbers were soggy and looked as sad as I was.  As a whole, not great at all.  Last was the sweet cake dessert, it was some sort of cupcake like creation with caramel sauce on top and vanilla bean ice cream.  The cake was a little too sweet, but the ice cream was awesome.

Needless to say I'm glad we went on restaurant week and I didn't pay the full price of $25 for the soggy salmon.  There is a chance that restaurant week threw them off their game, but truth be told I don't feel sorry for them.  This is your chance to bait and lure a TON of people back to your restaurant.  

Step your game up son!  Cam Newton would be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars because of the view. On the 21st floor of the building, the view is unbelievable. The drinks are pricey but delicious and strong. We only had drinks and apps since we did have dinner plans elsewhere but the menu looked pretty good. Our server was wonderful, friendly, with the excellent personality. We sat on the patio outside near the fire pit and watched the sun set over Charlotte. It was perfect and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I 100% agree with the three-star rating. It is an A-OK place due to the best view and decent (not amazing) food. Unfortunately, the service is what really knocks it back two stars. 

After making a reservation, we still had to wait about 15-20 minutes (after we were told 5-10 minute wait) due to lack of glassware. We had a Funny Bus Tour after at 8pm, so we were tight on time already. By the time we sat down, we ordered immediately to get things moving. The waiter seemed a little out of it but got our order in and the food out in a reasonable amount of time. After that, we really never saw him again (about 20- 30 minutes after food arrived). We looked around to get the bill, but he was no where to be found. We had told him we were in a bot of a hurry, and the plates were clean. I got up and found the manager to give us our bill because other waiters ignore my signal as well. We finally got the bill and paid quickly. 

It seems like there needs to be some work on the service end to make this place move up to 4+ stars because the location/view/menu are already up there. 

I am happy we went because we got some beautiful rooftop views. Maybe it is better for Happy Hour after work to watch the sunset."}
{"text":"Delicious cocktails! This will be a hot spot now that the weather is warming up for sure. I wish they had outdoor seating to soak in the view and provide additional space. Valet is $10 - $7 if you validate. I parked in a lot a few feet from the valet for $6- if possible I would recommend walking on taking the train as the entrance was a bit tricky to find. I will come back and sample the food - just enjoyed well mixed drinks after work."}
{"text":"A group of my girl friends (7) went here on a Friday night for a \"girls' night out\".  We made reservations 4 weeks ahead of time.  My first impression was the drink I got from the bar while waiting for the rest of my party to arrive. It was the Cucumber Hibiscus Collins and it was delicious-this is the only enjoyable part of my night and the only reason for two stars.  Once all of my party arrived, we were whisked to a back room that looked like a large conference room in any ordinary hotel. There were stock photos of the Wells Fargo Building on the wall, conference chairs, bad lighting, and zero ambiance.  We expressed our displeasure with the hostess and was not offered any legitimate reason for the separate room except it was for \"large parties.\"  The view was not of uptown but of the Target and Independence Expressway.  When you are ordering $40+ entrees for a special night out, the ambiance is everything, and it was not what we wanted or expected for a girls' night out. To top everything off, it took 40 minutes for our initial drink order to come, service was slow and unapologetic, and it took another 45 minutes for our waitress to split our check.  Food was so-so."}
{"text":"For our last meal before moving to the West coast, we stopped off at Fahrenheit just before the airport. We we were in a little bit of a time crunch, and with luggage it was a bit tricky.

Fortunately, the hotel stowed our luggage as we made our way to the 21st floor. The view from up there is quite nice, but there was a huge party of at least 35 people celebrating someone's 81st birthday and a wedding engagement. Someone from that party offered their apologies and offered us drinks on them, which was very thoughtful, but we weren't drinking.

We explained our situation about the flight and the waitress accommodated us and rushed our orders. For starters, we had Kung Pao chicken wings and chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. Both fantastic, but the dates were my favorite.

For the main course we had a rack of lamb and a lo mein wagyu short rib. Once again, both great dishes. Finally for dessert we had the Fahrenheit bar and the cookies and cream torte. You guessed it, equally fantastic.

What could make this meal better? The fact that the party decided to pay for our meal. Such a nice thing to do, and I had to thank them multiple times because it was really unnecessary (they were not wild, intrusive, or crazy at all). 

So it was a great meal and a good way to leave the east coast."}
{"text":"The View - Like other yelpers mentioned its the view of the city that's undeniably the best part of this restaurant.  Located at the 21st floor it sure does give you quite a nice view of those tall buildings with lights glowing at night.  Lots of outdoor seating space available and obviously the best tables are gone first.  Us, a party of 4 got a table at the end and our view is an empty parking lot LOL.  
Drinks - Our drinks were mules (Furiosa's Homecoming), Jewel Runner (served in that colored ceramic tiki mug) and couple ginger wheat beers.  All drinks were nice and strong enough.  
Food - We ordered Margherita pizzas, Wood grilled avocado and jerk style chicken wings.  Pizzas were good, nothing special.  Did not expect anything special anyway.  So no complaints on that.  Dough was fresh and the curst was good.  Wood grilled avocado was good too, basically two halves of avocado with some grill marks on them topped with some sauce and crostini on the side.  Avocado was fresh and its such a simple and tasty appetizer.  Wings was good too, again it wasn't unique but good.  Nothing much to complain about it or to praise.
Cost - Expensive!  Yes, honestly its a bit expensive for the food they serve.  Not sure if the view is the only reason for the high price because with those items we tried nothing felt special or out of ordinary.  Oh yea, parking is $10 but valet.  
Ambience was definitely great, our waitress was very attentive and checked on us frequently, great time with friends and a great view.  Normally I would give less than 4 stars when some things bother me, but I am still going with 4 stars for Fahrenheit for the view ( I will update my review when and if get bored of that, LOL)"}
{"text":"Main server was good. But everything else about the restaurant was terrible. Food was below average. Rest of the staff was also weired. The server that served water dropped ice and water on the floor intentionally."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to dine at Fahrenheit, but it always slipped my mind. I finally got around to it and it was a crowd pleaser!! 

The ambiance is elegant & cozy but doesn't at all have a snobby feel. Our server had the best personality and was truly wonderful at her job. 

After seeing all the reviews, I had to order the sangria- which was delicious! 

I came with my husband and mom (she is one tough critic and loved everything about Fahrenheit.) She ordered the filet and couldn't stop raving about how good it was. I couldn't decide between the lobster mac and cheese or the duck, so I ordered both and my husband and I split the two. The lobster mac was awesome, but a little too rich to eat the whole dish by itself. I enjoyed it.....but we pretty much fought over the duck!!! So tender, juicy and flavorful. Next time, we agreed to each order our own of that. 

The 3 of us had a phenomenal experience and it will for sure be on our list of repeats!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this since I have heard the view/food is amazing...but I was greatly disappointed. The view was wonderful and the pictures we took turned out great, but that was where the positives stopped. We had a reservation at 9pm, obviously not the peak dinner time, yet still had almost a 30 minute wait outside when the temperature was near freezing. The fire was nice, but not enough to keep you actually warm. The specialty drink menu only had one drink that even sounded decent (turns out it was not) and all were very overpriced.

When we were finally seated we orders appetizers of the lobster tacos (not much flavor, only 3 mini tacos per order) and calamari (best thing I ate). Since everything had been a bit of a let down I decided to get the filet mignon since steak is always my favorite. When I first got the steak I noticed it had some sort of glaze on it but when I cut into it I saw the perfectly medium cooked color and was excited. However, that first bite completely killed that mood. The glaze tasted like a sweet BBQ sauce which completely killed the natural flavor of the steak! I am certain the steak would have been delicious had they never put that glaze on top. In my opinion, if your steak needs a sauce to make it taste good, you are either not serving quality steak or you have no idea how to properly prepare and cook steak. When going into an establishment like this, with high prices like this, I expect my food to be amazing.

Overall I am sure this is a fun place to be during warmer weather and drinking classic drinks outside, but I will never come here again for dinner and certainly not when the night air isn't warm."}
{"text":"A friend took me to Fahrenheit for my birthday. I ordered the grilled haddock with lemon sauce, roasted red potatoes and bacon wrapped asparagus. It was delicioso, magnifico, fantastico and EXCELENTE! I will definitely be dining there again."}
{"text":"Very average contemporary American cuisine for well-above average price. Margarita Pizza was ok, somewhat bland, and cold by the time it was delivered to the table. One of our entrees (wings) was left out by the waitress accidentally. They quickly made them after realizing it and brought them out fresh. The wings were unique but left something to be desired. This was our first time and will not be returning. Too many better options in the area."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my Birthday dinner. Was seated immediately by the friendly hostess at our table which offered us an amazing view of the sunset, which is why we planned the dinner for that time. Our waiter was very friendly and came to see us soon after we were seated. We ordered our drinks and mine took a while to be made but it was worth the wait. I had the peach tea mint julep and wow. I could have drank 5 of them. We ordered the salmon and the scallops and we were both very happy with our meals. The presentation and the flavors were amazing. Things slowed down after that. It was very busy for a Monday night and our waiter was doing his best to serve all of his customers but they seemed short staffed for the amount of tables they had. We ordered the salted caramel cheesecake for dessert and it was also beautifully presented and delicious. After dinner we went on to the balcony and the view was just stunning. Over all, we were very happy with our visit and we'll definitely come back. I would have given 5 stars if the service was quicker but our waiter was amazing so this was more the fault of staffing issues."}
{"text":"Pork tenderloin was incredible, especially the cream corn base. I would also recommend the meatballs and apple crostata."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, excellent service and delicious food. Lobster tacos were amazing and the made us a cute special desert for our Anniversary, Thank You!"}
{"text":"So I have been dying to dine here so we went with my sister in law and brother in law last night. 
To start the waiter went to poor water and half of it went in my purse ! He goes oh sorry and that's it. Doesn't offer to clean it up. He was rather rude. We waited also for 15 minutes before he came over to get our drink order ! While we were waiting for our other couple to arrive my husband and I got to talking and forgot that it took so long for our drinks to get there. His explanation was the decaf coffee I ordered was brewing so I can't argue that !!!! 
When the other couple arrived my brother in law ordered a drink and the server kind of gave a slight attitude because he ordered the glass of wine by the brand which is normal to do not the type. The waiter seemed confused so my brother in law repeated it twice. 
Next we ordered appetizers and got the cauliflower and the chicken spring rolls. The cauliflower was excellent while the spring rolls didn't have much flavor and wouldn't order these again (the server highly recommended  them.) 
We ordered our main meals and two of us ordered the scallops, one ordered the filet, and my sister in law ordered off the vegetarian menu. 
The scallops were great but my husband was not pleases with the filet ! He never will go back. He said it was the worst filet he has had and would rather go to Hyde park, Red, Flemmings, and Morton's ! I was quite surprised with his response since Farentheit received great reviews !! 

They do have a cute patio but the surrounding area in treemont is such a dump. It is a shame that the area is taking so long to clean up. I cannot believe people want to live in this area !

We were going to try dessert which I have had before here. The apple dessert but decided to just call it a night. I know the dessert is amazing. 

The service hopefully is better that what we received but my husband would never go back here so looks like I won't be able to give it another try."}
{"text":"Quick hits:  Our father's chair broke, the whole back folded backwards, when he sat down.   Had he been less agile, he would have fallen hard.  No one said sorry, they simply switched out the chair and walked away
           
           Our waitress was very slow with all of our drinks (25 minutes), and forgot our mothers. It was not busy.  Eventually, after our food arrived, my mom went to the bar to get a beer, she does not like to eat without a drink.  The waitress, Joy, upon finding this out, RUDELY cut her off.  To quote mom, \"can you get that beer please\" Joy, \"not gonna happen.\"   
             To be clear, this would have been my mom's second beer, she was in no way drunk, and Joy's tone was nasty.  

            My sister and a friend stopped in to say hi after we had eaten our food, bringing our party to 6.  After dirty looks from Joy (the waitress), they each ordered a drink, in an attempt to not be rude. FYI the restaurant was mostly empty, they were not taking needed seats.  The waitress, Joy, after the incredibly bad service, of which we only mentioned the most egregious portions, applied an auto-gratuity, because we were now a table of 6.  

More details:  We were having Dinner on a Monday night, it was pretty empty.   Drinks were forgotten, or took over 20 minutes to arrive.  The food arrived before some of the drinks.  I had, prior to this night, enjoyed Fahrenheit, though the service had never been stellar.  I had recommended Fahrenheit to friends and brought all out-of-town guests there.   Even thought the manager, the other wait staff, and the hostess had seen and were aware of what was going on, we received not one apology.  I have not been back since."}
{"text":"So so. Definitely did not live up to the hype. Small portions and bland at best. I Wil say the rock shrimp app was fantastic though. The place is very tight and VERY loud. Service was average, definitely not anything exceptional. Place is very over priced for the portions and flavors."}
{"text":"We dropped by here for a drink and a quick bite after the Lakers/Hornets game since we were staying in the hotel. We planned to just get a small bite, but every appetizer sounded so good that we ordered most of the menu. 

The Kobe Beef Short Rib Steam Buns was my personal favorite and the Duck Confit Fried Rice was fantastic. Everyone also enjoyed the Lamb Sliders. No one in my party liked the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, unfortunately.

The desserts were, in one word, terrible. We ordered our desserts to go and went downstairs to our room to eat them. We had the vanilla ice cream, which tasted neither like vanilla or ice cream. Everyone in my party agreed that it tasted like a lime/lemon Italian ice. Definitely not what we expected. The Hot Chocolate Entermet was OK, but the chocolate mousse was very dense and the rum cake layer was quite dry. Would recommend skipping dessert here.

Our server was super nice and friendly, but he forgot a few things and seemed to stumble over the menu. Service from the rest of the staff was very good though. 

Fahrenheit was better than your average hotel restaurant, but I wouldn't seek it out and I'd say most items are overpriced for what they are."}
{"text":"**Review in regards to Large Party Booking - Not in regards to food or service** 

I am really disappointed in the way that they book large parties. I contacted these guys in regards to booking my engagement party in which the representative on the phone took all my information and assured me someone would call me back. A day goes by and because of the urgency of my approval I contacted Fahrenheit again. This time I got someone on the phone and they said that the restaurant was booked and had actually been booked for a couple weeks out as there's lots of events happening downtown Charlotte and they would not be able to accommodate us. Because of my desire to have my party at Fahrenheit I wasted an entire day waiting on a call back only if the first rep that I talk to new what the second rep knew I wouldn't have been waiting and wasting days.


**Please pardon my mistakes as I'm using Siri to dictate"}
{"text":"I started writing a long review. Stopped, as it seemed to negative. 
 The reality is that it was not as good as we have experienced in the past . Loud, hurried, lack-luster food equals a mediocre evening. From drink service to perceived value, it was a miss. Unfortunately, they could care less. When you don't ask for a to go box, they may want to wonder why. 
Just saying......"}
{"text":"A 3 star rating is pretty on point. I went for restaurant week with a group of 5. The hostesses and waiter were nice, great views outside. Terrible appetizers - we couldn't tell if there was any calamari in the calamari.  I was disappointed it was a recommended app, the kale salad was bleh. Once you count your loss there, the entree was great. I got the hanger steak while friends enjoyed the salmon. The wasabi mashed potatoes were a nice touch. Desserts were ok, bread pudding was dry. Cool place, loud inside. Maybe go for just a drink and entree outside during the summer."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant in Charlotte. You would think that for the price of a meal at this restaurant the service would be better than an Olive Garden. Definitely only paying for a view that you really can't even enjoy because you're so angered with the service."}
{"text":"I will start with the food, because it was all excellent. We went for brunch and ordered the Crab Cakes, the Jumbo Cap'n Crunch Pancakes and the special, which was Shrimp and Grits, and was out of this world. As I said, the food was excellent. The service was good as well and the view, as you have gathered, is so pretty.

But the restaurant itself looks like it came out of a cheesy 1980's disco-themed hotel lobby bar. The ambience was weird and cheesy and just didn't match with the food we were served. It was so off-kilter with its gross black topped tables that never look clean and tons or black-lacquered everything. If this restaurant was simply decorated differently it would entirely change the perception of the food.

I gave four stars because our food was perfect and delicious, but I would not go back because the ambience is so dated and worn down and sad which is such a shame."}
{"text":"My BF and I decided to try out Fahrenheit last weekend when we made our bi-annual trip to Cleveland. We are major foodies and enjoy dining out.   We have both worked at fine dining restaurants as servers so naturally, we notice the small things in terms of service.  Take this as a warning for details below.  While in Cleveland, we wanted to try the best place, and had heard some good things about the place. Perhaps it was my fault for expecting a top of the line, fine dining experience because we were both very disappointed with the food and especially the service. 

When we walked in, we were welcomed by a very polite hostess with a great smile, who led us to our table right away. Unfortunately, that was probably the best part of the night.  Then, at the table, we were welcomed by a waiter who had a waitress following him. I thought it was kind of awkward that the waitress did not say anything and just stared at us for a few minutes. Out of curiosity, I later asked if one of them was training, and that's when the waiter claimed he was the trainee.  Perhaps mentioning that in the beginning would have spared the awkwardness.  Both waiters appeared nice and presented friendly smiles, but the service they offered were just the opposite.

Anyway, for an appetizer, we shared the steak tartare spring rolls.  It wasn't really anything special.  I thought the tartare was a little chewy, but a decent dish.  I ordered a cocktail on the menu and my bf ordered the original old fashioned (one of the most basic and the easiest cocktail to make-- just sugar, bitters, and bourbon).  This is when the trouble started.  The server brought the \"newer\" old fashioned which has muddled fruits instead of sugar.  Right away, my BF told the server that he wanted the original old fashioned.  There was a bit of confusion and rapid discussion about the difference between the two drinks.  To make it simple, we just asked that he let the bartender know exactly what we wanted.   Our waiter then took the drink back and 5 minutes later, he brought a \"new drink.\"  Unfortunately, it was evident that he had brought the same exact drink with the muddled fruit fished out.  When our waiter returned, we were sure to address the situation and asked if a new drink could be made.  He immediately said, \"Actually, the bartender should be working on it now.\" umm what? Why didn't he inform us earlier when he delivered the \"new drink?\"  I don't know guys... maybe I have gotten spoiled by the 5 star service I have once provided as a waitress, but I would expect a fine dining establishment to get it right the 2nd time (if not the 1st) by taking the extra 15 seconds to create a new drink as the customer ordered instead of doing a sloppy 2 second job of taking the pieces of muddled fruit out and presenting it as a new drink.

Moving on-- I had ordered the Roasted Chicken Orecchiette and the BF ordered the BBQ duck pizza with hoisin sauce.  I had left for 4 minutes to use the restroom, and upon my return, I was disappointed to see that the food had been brought out minutes earlier.  From my experience, fine dining restaurants usually wait to serve the entrees until everyone is present--especially if there are only two guests. Apparently, the food runner came out and literally dropped the food in the middle of the table and walked away without saying a word.  No explanations, no names of the dishes nor a simple \"enjoy.\"  I'd expect better manners at Applebee's.  The food was pretty decent. In the words of my BF: \"The pizza was unique and tasty although the duck was on the gamy side and richness of hoisin sauce was little too overpowering for the light dough and the cheese perhaps adding a little bit of acidity to the sauce and diluting down the richness a bit would make this pizza better.\"  I liked my chicken pasta, but wasn't impressed.

Overall, I really wanted to like this place and I wish I could offer a better rating.  However, after my experience last weekend, I do not believe that Fahrenheit deserves any more than 2 stars if one or two of the disappointments mentioned above were avoided.  Needless to say, you will not see me back at Fahrenheit next time I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a late Sunday afternoon after visiting the Mint Museum. We sat at the bar and ordered cocktails and the lobster roll and the calamari salad (small bites). The bar was not crowded, the servers were attentive and the drinks were perfectly made (not the rule for straight-up cocktails in Charlotte bars). Lobster roll concoction tasted good (buttered brioche bread!) but not much lobster (maybe it should have a different name?); calamari had a wonderful Thai-style dressing but could have been a bit crisper (I would order it again). Bill came to 53 USD. Views are lovely, and we strolled along the 3-sided outdoor rooftop. There is a vegetable and herb garden; outdoor seating; a really small pool (quick dunk?). All told, it was a good 'hang' for us.The  entrees don't particularly attract our taste in dining out, but we will certainly come back for apps and drinks. Parking for this oddly situated building on Caldwell is problematic (did I mention the views?). If there are no immediate parking spots available on 3rd Street, I highly recommend that you not waste your time, but leave your car with the valet parking (7 clams with validation)."}
{"text":"Great view and service. Tried the food here twice. Each time I'm satisfied. I usually choose seafood and this time I tried the lobster roll (app) and the salmon (wild caught) done medium. It was really good especially on the bed of mashed avocado and miso I think sweet sauce. I had the nc saki drink it was really very tasty !! The view and ambiance is beautiful. Bar scene is too crowded... Wish I could they could expand the bar to the outside. Either way love it!"}
{"text":"Did dinner for two on a hot Saturday night. Reservations made on Monday were necessary to secure a seat. 

Upon arrival we opted for valet service to avoid the parking battle. I'm going to guess that was a wise idea based on how busy Tremont was. Once inside, we were met by the hostess who was all business and got us seated almost immediately. We were happy with the seating but immediately notice how loud the place was. Despite the small two seater, we found ourselves nearly yelling at each other for the remainder of the evening to compensate for the volume. 

Our server was great and left us with nothing but good things to say about Fahrenheit's service. 

Drinks were good.  A spritzer of sorts for the wife and a traditional Mule for me. Mule was a bit heavy on the ginger, but not enough to prevent me from finishing it off. 

On to the Cleveland Nachos for an app. These are wonderful but quite heavy and are a massive portion. Easily takes care of four. 

For the main course, wife did the scallops and I opted for their legendary beef short ribs. Both were good, but nothing that knocked our socks off. The scallops were a bit overdone leaving them rubber like and chewy. Not bad enough to send back, but close. The short ribs were good, but nothing that has me running back for more. 

Dessert was the Mason Jar filled with angel food cake, strawberries, milk curd...  I would go on, but the result doesn't justify the effort. Boring, difficult to eat, and kind of disappointing. 

In the end it was about a $200 night that was worth about half of that. Would we return?  Maybe (that leans more to the side of no).

A side note. About an hour after getting home we both felt quite ill. I can't draw any direct correlation to our meal, but it's certainly suspect."}
{"text":"So, my boyfriend and I came in around 7:30 on a Sunday night. We were informed there weren't any more reservations for the evening but we could sit in the bar area.
My first observation at Fahrenheit is that all the serving staff is young and lacking knowledge about customer service...or anything for that matter.
We ordered two beers to start, two cocktails, calamari & green papaya salad as appetizers, and the ramen and filet for our entrees. Everything was pretty good until my boyfriends filet came out OBVIOUSLY over cooked and tough. 
We were trying to be polite by not sending it back or complaining too much (not that we had any chance to complain because our server never came back to check and see if everything was done to our liking.) Finally, we had a chance to tell our inattentive server that the steak was over cooked and not enjoyable. She said she would speak to her \"manager\" about removing it from our bill. A guy in a horribly oversized and untailored suit came to our table to state his unprofessional opinion about why he couldn't remove it from our bill and said if we would have let him know sooner he could have done something about it and had a new filet cooked. 
Let's get something straight, I understand that some folks think that complaining will just get them a free meal. But, when a couple comes in an orders 8 different items it's obvious were not just looking for a free meal. 
Not removing our filet made your restaurant look cheap, disrespectful, and ridiculous. 
Having a cook come out of the kitchen and talk shit in a corner together, laughing, and staring at us about how he thinks he is entitled to not admit he over cooked a damn steak is unprofessional and insulting to your customers. 
And arguing with a customer about why their meal was inedible and not enjoyable without any apologies or recognition for a simple mistake made you look stupid. 
My boyfriend went back up and asked for another filet to be cooked and put in a to-go box because we weren't going to leave a restaurant being forced to pay $45 dollars for a dish that never got to be eaten. 
So we graciously gave our take out filet ordered to a homeless man on our walk home. And we graciously will never be returning to this restaurant because of the lack of professionalism and disgusting personalities of every employee in there."}
{"text":"As a native from Cleveland I was so excited to find out Fahrenheit was coming to Charlotte. For of you that don't know, the owner also has as location in Cleveland. The menus are slightly the same, but they have a select few different options. I loved the Cleveland location when I went there, but the Charlotte spot has been a miss for me. 

-The location: Nothing can beat the view! The restaurant is located on one of the top floors of the Hyatt hotel and the view is AMAZING! They don't have much outdoor seating which is a bummer- it's more of a hang out spot. But this is a must for out of towners. You see the entire Charlotte skyline,

-The drinks: The cocktails are awesome and unique! However, they are a little pricey with the average drink price around $12. The wine selection is Ok. Nothing to rave about for being a nice restaurant.

-The atmosphere: It's modern, but elegant. A bit fancier than most places so make sure you comb your hair when you come here.

-The food: This is the biggest miss for me. The food was just average. Nothing to really rave about. I got the salmon once, which was served with wasabi mashed potatoes. Holy crap- whoever thought of that idea needs to go back to the drawing board. My brother is a head chef and thought that sounded disgusting too. My husband got the filet and it was good- but again, nothing to rave about. It was a little tough. On the bright side- the calamari was pretty good, but nothing to come back for.

-The service: Service has been hit or miss. The first time we came here our service was horrible! When we sat at the bar the bartenders have been great though.

Overall, I would come here for special occasions or to take out of town guest- mainly for the view. I recommend to sit at the bar and get a drink & app, but not stay for dinner. I think there are better places to eat in Charlotte for the money. OR just travel to the Cleveland location :-) Since I loved the Cleveland location I'll give this a 3 stars...."}
{"text":"So it's been awhile.... but I am happy to be back to Chef Whalen's spot!!!
Whether outside on the patio (cool place to people watch), at the bar or a table in the main room, you will be so comfortable and at home...my fav is at the bar...BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU A BASKET OF BACON!!!

So, I said it,,,bacon!!!! You don't eat bacon, pass it to me, please.  You want more, they bring you more!

I have enjoyed the Cleveland Cheesesteak (ridiculous) and the Crispy Wings (sticky, spicy yummy) on Happy Hour!

On the main menu, The Fried Cauliflower is satisfying without being over the top... lil sweet, white raisins, salty capers and a light but flavorful burnt lemon vinaigrette...
the Kobe Beef Short Ribs with Lo-Mein Noodles and Mushrooms are the Best ever! 
NO, the Verlasso Salmon with the Wasabi Mash Taters is the Best!
Guess what? Go and find out for yourself...yu will have to return to try them all! Or not and order them all at once!  That is why \"take home\" containers were created.

OH, and don't forget the red velvet cheesecake..it is half cake and half cheesecake!!!
Yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"You couldn't pay me to go back here!  This was probably the worst meal out I've had in a long time.  I ordered the ahi tuna, SO bland and tasteless.  I took one bite while the server was there and said \"wow this is terrible\" he offered me a side of rice... I think to wash it down.  My wife ordered the lobster mac and cheese.  It was actually pretty good but not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"There are a lot of haters on here.

As for fine dining, this is one of the better place in NC and in this area. I had the braised short beef ribs over lo mien noodles. Very tender and tasty, the view is amazing too. i think a lot people are salty and got the wrong thing, or they think fine dining shouldn't cost...they got a pizza from here, really, why cause its the cheapest option? this ain't Brixx's Pizza.

I complemented my meal with a Spicy Charlotte cocktails."}
{"text":"Lovely & romantic restaurant with a gorgeous view of the city. Prices are high for small portions but what can I say they are so good. Definitely get the Kobe beef short rib steamed buns...you won't regret it!!:)) Also, servers are super sweet and nice here. Overall great atmosphere. It's on the 29th floor of the Hyatt Hotel. Will come again for a special occasion;)"}
{"text":"The ambiance earns 5 stars!
The view, amazing!
The Food, darn it! The crisp Calamari, not crispy and the Thai sauce is way to salty. The Seared Ahi Tuna, with the green curry purée-lets just say that seared ahi is one of my favorite dishes, just not tonight, not from here. 

BUT I WILL BE BACK.... The ambiance alone deserves a second chance!"}
{"text":"I recently had an amazing birthday dinner at Fahrenheit.  My partner and I made a reservation for 7:30 pm on a Friday night.  We arrived around 7 p.m. to grab a drink and enjoy the rooftop bar.  We had a vodka martini and moscow mule - they were both made very well. We enjoyed the sun beginning to set over the skyline while we stood near gas fire pits.  At 7:30, we were promptly seated - at first, we were going to be seated behind a wall with no view of the skyline, but we asked to be moved and were given a table with a lovely view.

Our server was knowledgeable and attentive.  We started with the kale and brussel sprout salad - more kale than brussel sprouts, which I found a bit disappointing - and the chorizo stuffed dates.  The latter came with about 8 dates - very rich and tasty.  We then enjoyed the short ribs (one of the best things I have ever eaten) and the seared scallops.  I tend to find scallop main courses to be fairly small - this was no exception, but they were very delicious.  

We were both celebrating a birthday that evening, so our server brought us both out a small birthday cake with a candle.  It was a nice and unexpected touch.  

The food, service and atmosphere were all top notch. I would recommend Fahrenheit to anyone for a special occasion dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink with a view, and let me tell ya. THIS VIEW. It's the best view of Uptown by a long shot. It's so great. 

Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's just delicious! The food is very tender and tasteful. We had the short ribs, amazing flavor, and I had the filet which melts in your mouth. Our only criticism is the bartender throwing empty bottles in the trash which is loud and reminiscent of a college bar at 1:00am. We loved the food and the view, it's a definite thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood with lots of artsy shops, however, Fahrenheit is a treat on its own - great, creative appetizers (on the pricey side), but fantastic drinks, including a pretty impressive martini menu."}
{"text":"Views galore.  The place can get a little warm in the summertime but a few cold cocktails should remedy that.  The food was delicious and you could tell was prepared with intention.  The service was good but since they were so busy, it was hard to have really good personal service at the tables.  This would be great place for a private event and also coming at sunset to see the city.  Parking is not bad and they have valet."}
{"text":"great atmosphere

wonderful service

diverse menu selection

reasonably priced

nice mule menu

looking to try brunch"}
{"text":"A few girlfriends and I went to Fahrenheit for brunch and absolutely loved it! I had the cinnamon crunch casserole which was absolutely delicious! The restaurant itself is very beautiful with such an amazing view! I definitely want to return for dinner at some point to see the beautiful Charlotte skyline at night! My only suggestion would be to add some more vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Wish I had more time in Cleveland this time around to enjoy a full meal here....but I had to swing by to try their selection of sorbets.  Rhubarb was delicious!  NOT ICY or tart.  I came by almost 20 minutes to closing time and kudos to the staff via their smiles/politeness by accommodating me and a few other guests.   I'll be back to try the protein and veggies here no doubt.

Dedicated vegan menu-!

The staff will be very attentive to the gluten or allergy sensitive!

I'll be back....  on to the next city!"}
{"text":"I had read reviews that panned the food. But raved about the view. So I was ready to not be disappointed by the food. But I'm going to say that it surprised me as I thought the food was pretty good. We all shared appetizers. Chorizo stuffed dates, steamed mussels, pork belly buns, and fried oysters.  

I'll say the mussels were literally the best I've ever had. The curry broth was a bit sweet for me. But what made them was that they were steamed perfectly. And fresh!  They were soft, and succulent. I've NEVER had mussels with texture like that. I usually expect kinda rubbery, not hard, but not soft. These were another category in quality altogether. 

And wine; they had a decent wine list. Not much selection by the glass, the list pushes you to get a bottle. 

Their view is not because of the height of the hotel. The view is good of Charlotte as their skyline looks toward the skyscrapers of the inner city. If you were on the skyscrapers in the inner fort, which are taller than Fahrenheit, you'd see out onto no skyscrapers and look into the rooftops of lower buildings at the edge of the city.

They could use improvement for sure. Handle the noise issue. Better arrange the view from tables. Use more professional trained staff. It has kind of a night club feel, without the music."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best meal I have ever had. The salmon and Brussels sprouts were so delicious. The grilled avocado and ahi nachos were out of the world. Sooo glad i came to this place on my last night on Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food here is completely OVERRATED. Nothing we ordered was good except the pizza (again, pizzzaaaaa!!!). Please stay away and spend your money elsewhere especially if you are African-American. They treat minorities like we are less than. Our waiter did not even introduce herself, wasn't friendly and took forever to serve us; literally, brought us water and then 15mins later our straws and then 10mins later lemons. Then came back another 20mins later to take our order. It's like she was avoiding us!  Didn't even ask us what we would like to drink or whether we wanted appetizers but instead just went straight to the main course. Whenever we wanted to substitute anything, she pointed out that it was way too \"expensive for us\". Overall, the food sucks and they aren't welcoming to black folks. So please spend your money elsewhere!!! STAY AWAY....SN, Please read the reviews and you will notice that all black people are saying the exact same thing.  Be warned!!"}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is more than a restaurant, it's an experience. If you decide to pay them a visit it's helpful to have come properly aligned expectations. To that end, may I prescribe the following:

Expertly-prepared, seasonal, delicious cuisine
Attentive, professional, memorable service
Warm, upscale, comfortable atmosphere

Yes, the food is costly but by no means outrageous. So what does that mean? A salad/appetizer might set you back $10 or $12, entrees come in a scosche under $30, and if pizza's your thing be prepared to fork over about $17 for a 12\" pie. This is real food prepared by trained chefs using actual ingredients. I'm a true believer that you get what you pay for.

The service during this and every visit we've paid to Fahrenheit has been exceptional. Our server was precise and attentive in just the right amounts and her frequent pop-ins to check on our progress didn't seem even the slightest bit intrusive. She also knew the menu very well and recited the specials of the evening without missing a beat (or looking over our heads to read them from a menu board). The rest of the wait staff was also on-point with waters being refilled as needed, plates being cleared in a timely fashion and, generally, making sure the rest of the dining room was tip top.
 
The atmosphere of Fahrenheit is definitely upscale but far from pretentious. It has the requisite wall-o-wine and marble bar up front, but don't let that turn you off. The décor is warm and comfortable with intelligent use of lighting, texture and color. Exposed bricks, interesting wall coverings and funky chandeliers bring it all together. 
 
I've never had a bad dish at Fahrenheit. Yeah, I've had some I've liked better than others, but none of them has been ill-prepared. The seasoning is typically spot- on, no fear of salt here, the meats are cooked as ordered, and everything is loaded with fresh ingredients. Our latest meal proved once again that if it ain't broke...
 
Apple Salad - If I'm paying $10 for a salad it had better be flawless. This was. A bundle of watercress lightly dressed with cinnamon vinaigrette and sprinkled with white cheddar cheese, walnuts and shaved apple. The perfect balance - sweet, acid, crunchy, creamy. I could have eaten two.

Squash Soup (seasonal offering) - Fall in a bowl. Velvety smooth and autumn orange puree of squash topped with a drizzle of balsamic, toasted nuts and bits of crispy kale. The warm spices (nutmeg? Allspice?) and the slight sweetness of the balsamic paired wonderfully with the naturally sweet squash. The nuts added some much-needed crunch.

Calamari Salad - Be forewarned, this one's on the larger side. A bed of garden-fresh baby greens tossed with a salty/sweet and earthy miso vinaigrette, and topped with lightly breaded and fried kimchee and rings of calamari. A Thai chili sauce was drizzled about adding to the dish's overall heat. Definitely spicy. I found the calamari a touch on the salty side for my taste but the flavor combination of the miso and the kimchee was brilliant.

Coffee & Mustard Crusted Pork Tenderloin - This is my wife's favorite dish at Fahrenheit. A perfectly cooked pork tenderloin (medium, as requested) served atop a bed of mashed sweet potatoes and garlic spinach. This pork was so tender it made me angry and the maple glaze pushed me over the edge. How can something so simple taste so complicated? The use of toasted macadamia nuts in the mash was a great surprise.
 
Grilled New York Strip Steak - About an 8oz serving of meat, cooked a dead-to-rights medium and served with a cup of parmesan-dusted shoestring fries, roasted baby carrots and topped with chimichurri. I had some minor issues with this dish. While the meat was tender and delicious, it wasn't properly trimmed leaving some pretty toothsome gristle to work through. I also found the fries a bit awkward to eat with the steak and my fingers got pretty messy in the process. The baby carrots were tender and sweet but one of the larger ones was on the cusp of being underdone.

Pumpkin Cheesecake - I see this on a menu and I have to order it. This dessert, clearly made in-house, was amazing. The pumpkin cheesecake was not overly sweet and the graham cracker crust the perfect textural foil. I could have eaten a bowl of the whipped mascarpone and candied walnut brittle all by itself. This makes the offering of a certain \"factory\" seem a lifeless facsimile.

Fahrenheit Coffee - Having a fancy meal? Gotta have a fancy coffee, right? This fit the bill and went perfectly with the cheesecake. Perfect coffee mixed with Cocoa Di Vine, Kahlua, Drambuie and a schmearing of whipped cream on top. Decadent and warming.
 
We continue to be impressed by Fahrenheit and Chef Rocco Whalen. His dishes are inspired creations, not the tired result of a line cook following graphical directions from a wall poster. You can taste the thought that went into them and the use of fresh, seasonal ingredients is well worth any culinary sticker sho"}
{"text":"I am in love with the new cheesesteak sandwich on the happy hour menu! Amazing! Also really like the cocktails. Definitely my fav happy hour place in Tremont!"}
{"text":"I attended the soft opening on a Saturday night for Fahrenheit a few weeks ago.Located in Charlotte's Uptown on top of Skye Condos, this is another creation by the famous Chef Rocco Whalen. 
The hostesses were very friendly, and accommodating when our reservation was delayed 45 minutes (due to people lingering and having more wine...I can't say that's a bad sign). We headed to the restaurant bar, which has a very cool hotel vibe to it. Since it was a soft opening, there weren't any specialty cocktails on the menu yet. The bartender said they were in process of creating them, so I'll definitely have to come back to check out one.
The rooftop has gorgeous views of Charlotte. I can imagine this will be a trendy spot for people to linger by the elongated fireplaces on the rooftop and mingle. 

Our waiter was extremely nice and apologized for the wait. He was knowledgeable of the product and answered all of our questions.To start, I had the Goat Cheese Salad which was delicious. The pistachio brittle game a little salty crunch against the cherry tapenade. For a main entrée, I had the scallops. As an avid scallop lover, I have a very high standard when it comes to ordering them, and I was not disappointed. Although the scallop dish was not grand in portion, the cauliflower puree and the buttery scallops were comfort food at its finest. 
My friend had the Smoked Ribeye, which is what I will be ordering next time. It was cooked to perfection and had a lot of flavor. 
For dessert we split the Ghiradelli Sea Salt Cookies, which were a little to the crunchier side than my preference of a softer cookie. However, I'm never going to turn down a cookie!

Parking is tough, as it is in midtown. I would recommend cabbing or finding a parking garage within walking distance. As it was close to the Epicenter, it got a little crazy on the streets (it was CIAA weekend and the town was ready to party), but Fahrenheit was a nice getaway in the sea of madness. I can imagine it will be a refuge during the summer when the colleges are out."}
{"text":"I've only eaten food as it was catered to my work this past Summer and I was pretty disappointed.

Like it or not, there are certain regions where food is not made as good as other regions.  Ever more specifically, there are restaurants who can't seem to make a good ethnic dish...especially when the restaurant doesn't solely focus on that style.  Fahrenheit is a good example of that.

We had some Asian-infused food, which to me no matter where you go, is a red flag.  Perhaps it just wasn't for my palate, but I could barely swallow the food.

I'm not meaning to take anything away from the restaurant.  I've never actually eaten there.  The restaurant could be great, as could the service, as well as the other dishes for that matter.

I would give 2 stars, but since I haven't actually eaten at Fahrenheit, they get one more pity star from me :)"}
{"text":"It's true. The short ribs are no joke. The dish appeared on the small side when it arrived, and then I found myself stuffing it down my face hole even though I was full after eating the first three quarters. Sooo yummy.

Tasty cocktails as well. I had an Autumn something that arrived in a martini glass. Despite my hatred of martini glasses, I happily sipped this one throughout dinner and did not have room for a glass of wine after. 

Ambience was lovely, although it was rather warm in there last night. Good thing I was with friends and not on a date, or I might have been a bit embarrassed when I started sweating when the food arrived. 

All in all, top marks for this one. No surprises there after seeing the stars abound on Yelp. Good lookin' out, friends!"}
{"text":"My dinner experience here was overall very good. It was for a large party for a friend's birthday. We ordered many of the appetizers off the menu as well as some of the dinner specials. The truffle meatballs were outstanding. Large juicy meatballs made with veal, beef, and pork. The red wine sauce was amazing with the meatballs. The chilean sea bass and the pork shank I ordered was very well done (no not overcooked). The sea bass was simply prepared and it was melt in your mouth good! The pork shank was meaty, smokey, and tender. The sweet and mild polenta nicely complimented the smokiness of the meat. 

I think happy hour is also another highlight here. If you get early enough you get complimentary bacon at the bar! Happy hour also runs until 7pm which is great since you can visit multiple places in Tremont for happy hour and end at Fahrenheit. The cocktails and beer selection is good for the happy hour prices. The food however is a great deal, you can easily get a full meal for around $12! The burger with goat cheese and the truffle oil fries are great! Burgers are cooked to your liking and the blend of meat is good quality. The fries are thinly cut and fried to a nice light crisp. The parmesan and truffle oil adds nice flavors and aroma to the fries. 

Come here for happy hour and/or dinner and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The view is awesome and the outside patio area is really cool. 

The food, was ok. If I were to return to Fahrenheit it would be to take a friend for a cocktail and to see the view not to eat. I mean, the food was fine, it just wasn't worth the price. 

I was kind of surprised by the pop music they were playing in what is suppose to be a finer dining establishment but I just shrugged it off. Our service though was great and friendly and welcoming. 

Overall, I would return for drinks and the view."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday and had the Father's Day Brunch.  The food was great.  I had the chicken fried rice.  Drinks were great too and the view was obviously perfect.  Great job Fahrenheit.  Oh and the prices were very reasonable for brunch."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration dinner as a family of four, the staff was pleasant and attentive, the cocktails (I especially liked khaleesi) tasted good, the view was absolutely beautiful, but the food...well let's just say I'd go back for a drink and to enjoy the view, but not for the food."}
{"text":"Kind of a hip new place which I thought might disappoint. We went for a birthday. Service was good, we were right at the window with a nice view. They accommodated my request for a side substitution with my meal so I got the meat that most appealed paired with the side that most appealed. It did not disappoint! The pleasant surprise was the avocado appetizer - it was simple & delish!"}
{"text":"So I came for a good happy hour on my birthday adventure and I loooove the view. It overlooks all of downtown Charlotte accompanied with attractive men and women from all walks of life. The bartender was quick and prompt with my glass of champagne. A little pricey however worth EVERY sip! We munched on vegetable lo mein and enjoyed conversation with a sailor and his wife. This is definitely for the elite however still simple."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and it never fails to deliver. Amazing food, amazing craft cocktails, great bar area. Menu changes but some standout apps are the tuna poke nachos (spicy!), the lamb sliders, and the steamed buns, and every entree has been great. View, atmosphere and staff are fantastic. Rocco is the best."}
{"text":"I, and three well travelled \"foodies\", had heard about Fahrenheit and had also read some marginal reviews so we decided to see for ourselves. The views, the outside space and the ambiance were wonderful.  Food was great on every plate!  We had the stuffed figs and grilled avocado to start....and groaned appreciatively thru both. Pretzel rolls were delicious and then the scallops, steaks, fish and sides....well we all were thrilled.  
Our server Zach was upbeat. informative and a joy to dine with.  Four thumbs up and we'll be back (if we can get in).Reservations are tough to get but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet -- chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I am going to start this review off by saying this was my third experience at Fahrenheit. Each time I have been, I would decrease the rating starting with my first experience being a 5 star experience, my second a 3 star, and my third probably more like a 1.5, but I really want this place to turn around. Here are some of my observations:

Drinks: On my most recent occasion we started the meal with cocktails. There is a little nifty iphone app that allows one free drink per person per app. When we presented this app to our waiter for the three people at the table, he literally made us feel like criminals. I had used this app before (and spent substantial amounts of money on food and extra drinks along with the app) and never meant to feel so poorly. My suggestion: do not have the app if you do not want people to use it.

Appetizers and Bread: One of my favorite parts about Fahrenheit was the delicious home bake bread and spreads that they offered complimentary with the meal. They have an awesome honey butter and olive tampanade that is to die for. This time we were presented with stale rolls that seemingly were purchased at the local grocery store. When we asked the waiter what happened to the bread he said he had no idea and hated the rolls himself - this was an obviously not good tone set for the rest of the meal. I order some sort of Asian salad to start my meal and while the dressing was tasty...it was suppose to be topped with nuts etc. However what I got was a plate full of lettuce. Major disappointment!

Meals: I ordered the walleye dish with brussel sprouts and potatoes, my two guests ordered an asian style salmon and a mushroom flatbread. The walleye left something to be desired - salt made this slightly better but the dish was drenched in butter and severely lacking flavor. The salmon rice looked like it may have been from a box but the dish did have more flavor - overall a meh. Finally the mushroom flatbread was tasty but nothing remarkable.

Atmosphere: We sat on the patio which seemed like a nice option on a gorgeous Friday night (gotta take what you can get in Cleveland). Top 40 pop songs were blaring over a speaker which seemed a bit odd for the usual ambiance of Fahrenheit. Additionally, our white table cloth was littered with ashes since used ash trays sat at each table - major turn off. Just seemed to take a classier restaurant to biker bar pretty fast.

We decided to take dessert somewhere else and with a $90 bill not including drinks (since they were free and we decided we didn't want anymore) I will go to Dante or Lolita next time I am in Tremont. I loved this restaurant at one time, but it has gone down in quality, service, and flavor. With so many awesome restaurant choices in Cleveland - Fahrenheit better seriously step up their game!"}
{"text":"Ok, there has to be a first one, so let it be me.  No I am not a friend or family that attended the soft opening.  I had dinner with three friends after reading all the hype on a Tuesday night. Maybe it was the hype, maybe it just wasn't ready.  First the food was good but inconsistent.  My short ribs were over barked and somewhat tough.  The flavors were there in the overall dish but the meat left something to be desired. The scallops and accompaniments were again well flavored but lukewarm to cool at best.  The lamb was again overcooked and served cool.  The salads kale and calamari were all very good.  The bar area, which you see as soon as you walk in looks fun and upscale.  Our dining room however was spartan and sterile with barren walls looking more like it was a restaurant in the Hyatt Place than an upscale eatery atop a uptown building.  Maybe it was the newness but Fahrenheit left us feeling a few degrees short of warm.  I will give it a month to work out the kinks and give it one more chance."}
{"text":"I was very excited to go to Fahrenheit for the first time last night. My friends and I arranged our schedules so we could all try it out in restaurant week. As we are all servers ourselves we know what restaurant week really means to the staff. They're not looking forward to it. 
My husband and I arrived before the rest of our party, sat at the bar, got a drink and look at the beautiful scene. The view stretched for miles!!! The bar tender was quick and efficient on closing our tab as soon as our friends arrived. We sat at a table that had a spectacular view of the city!! Then our waiter came by.. and it was all downhill from there. 
His name was Damion, and he could not care less who we were or what kind of experience we were looking for. We made it known to him that we all work in the industry, and he still didn't care. (i expect no special treatment because I am a server. I just know it's setteling to know who you're serving has been in your shoes) 
It takes about 20 minutes to get our first round of drinks and the bottle of wine we ordered.
We chose to stear clear of the RW menu. Ordering three appetizers for the table we were told one wouldn't be available. Our server then suggested the short rib sliders. They were the BEST thing we ordered! Damion got that right, for sure! Finished up our apps and place our dinner order. 
2 of our 4 dishes came out correctly and in a good amount of time. They were given to the wrong seats but at least it was the correct food. 
I ordered the ahi tuna which on the menu states that it is a seared tuna (rare) that's how I would have ordered it anyway if I had been asked a temp. It was at least a medium in temperature. My friend who ordered the ribeye MR received the short ribs. The server assistant was really apologetic and removed his plate instantly. 
When our server finally returned and I asked him about the temp of my tuna he proceeded to CURSE in front of our table (servers #1 no no!!!) The manager, Adam, came by took one look at my tuna and said I was too overdone, he would take care of it, and if we needed anything else he was our guy. 
My friend and I received a bow of soup each. Spicy tomoato, and it was awesome!!! We got our food, but \"our guy\" (adam) never came back to make sure it was okay. 
2 of our plates were removed when our server starts pushing desserts. I knew I wanted the Salted Carmel Cheesecake anyway so I was okay with looking at the menu early. He came by THREE more times before we were done eating to push desserts. Finally we order. The cheesecake may have been the very best part about it. 
30 minutes later we hadn't seen our server. Finally flag him down and ask for the check. He brings it all one one (doesn't ask if we want to split anything) which is fine, we're grownups we figured it out. 
After we paid we took the rest of our drinks and went to the patio. We spent about 20 minutes out there. The view was incredable. The seating and atmosphere were amazing! 

All in all it was a bad experience. I am willing to try again when it's not restraunt week, because the atmosphere and vibe was exactly what I was looking for. 
If I can ever convince my husband to go back we will request Damion NOT be our server. I will have to request someone who knows how to care for their guests.

Food: excellent (when it comes out right)
Atmosphere: chill, fun, upbeat fine dining.
View: AMAZING 
Service: really really extra poor."}
{"text":"I was finally able to see what all the buzz was about.  The clever combination of fresh ingredients made the great tasting food to be the highlight of the visit.  The signature drinks were also unique creations, but overpriced.  The choices upon the wine list were underwhelming.  It is interesting that people place Fahrenheit on their destination list because of the view and roof top terrace, but the doors to the outside were awkwardly placed out of normal lines of sight and circulation patterns.  Fahrenheit adds to Charlotte's diversity."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant downtown. My wife and I have gone here several times for birthdays, holidays, and just because. The menu changes often and allows for unique and inventive flavors. We were able to go to a beer pairing when they matched foods with Great Lakes brewery beers,\"Amazing\"!!! Don't wait , if you have a special occasion coming up This is the place to go. Hats off to chef Rocco and his staff"}
{"text":"I loved it when it first open. But they changed the menu , and food taste a lil cheaper than when it first open . But the view is the best in town!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fun date night. The food is good but nothing spectacular. Your visit will be based on the atmosphere and the rooftop view!"}
{"text":"This review is about their happy hour, and it makes me happy.  Delicious small plates, really good wine list.  We had the Cleveland Cheesesteak, Tacos, and a few items from their full menu - the lamb sliders and the meatballs.  

Bread: the complimentary bread was good.  The olive tapenade and butter set it over the top.  I could have ate this all night.  

Cleveland Cheesesteak: awesome.  It wasn't that cheesesteak you get from sandwich shops around the area. Truffle infused cheez wiz, a beautifully done roll. It was crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside and held up well to the onions, mushrooms, and wiz.  It was spot on. 

Lamb Sliders: they were topped with Brie and were awesome.  The flavor of the lamb mixed well with the Brie.  They had a slight gamey flavor which worked well with the creaminess of the cheese. Normally lamb is too bland for me.  These were excellent. 

Meatballs: moist, flavorful, and just the right amount. I'm a stickler when it comes to meatballs, being Italian I rarely if ever have had one that stacks up to my grandmothers and these do.  

Tacos: I did not try the tacos. I believe they were from the happy hour menu and were shrimp.  They looked good and my dining partner enjoyed them immensely.  


The value was there too, good prices for happy hour.

I've been to Fahrenheit numerous times and will continue to go."}
{"text":"I brought my out of town guests here after a failed attempt at another restaurant and had an amazing experience. From the perfect service to the food and cocktails everything was great! My guests were still raving the next day about how amazing the food was. This is my go to for when friends come to visit!"}
{"text":"Great service great view but food was blah had the short ribs they were extremely salty including the lo mein it's served upon I expected great food and was really disappointed would return for a drink and the view defiantly not for dinner"}
{"text":"We went to Fahrenheit on a early Saturday evening to celebrate a wedding anniversary. The up-and-coming Tremont is such a cute and trendy cove in Cleveland, which is the exact kind of area a restaurant like Fahrenheit should be. I would describe the restaurant as partially fine dining with a bit of a rustic feel. You definitely dress up to come here.

First, I have to say the service was some of the best ever. Our waitress was super friendly, helpful, and was very attentive to our needs without being overbearing. I wish I could remember her name. Also, my grandfather is in a wheelchair and they were excellent at accommodating him with a portable ramp. They even left it out for us in anticipation of our departure from the restaurant.

Their bread was to die for. The food was very good, everyone really enjoyed everything they got and I LOVED that they had a vegan menu. It's a limited menu, with about two entrees and a few appetizers, but it's something and the selections all sounded delicious. I got the Seared Cleveland Tofu. I was very good, but definitely could have been hotter in temperature. Same with the Tofu Tostada appetizer I ordered. For dessert, I had a vegan brownie ice cream.

One thing that was not so great was the manager or whom ever approaching us at the end of our meal to, in so many words, ask us to hurry up and leave because the next reservation for that table had arrived and were waiting on us to go. Didn't sit too well with us at the time, but I would still come back here."}
{"text":"Summary: Awesome menu but food was poorly executed. Good service, tasty cocktails and local beers. GREAT view and ambience. Parking too expensive.

Details: Came here on a Wednesday night for a 6:45 reservation. First impression was of a packed and energetic bar scene and an incredible view of downtown. We waited 10-15 minutes for a table, even though we had a reservation, and even though there were at least a half dozen tables visibly open. Kinda annoying, but fine.

Got seated with a menu, wine list, and cocktail/draft list. Waiter and a trainee came over within 2 minutes to welcome us and get drink orders. Shortly after he put the drink order in, he came back to go over specials and get appetizer order. We got the lobster roll appetizer, which came out pretty quickly. The flavor was great and it was perfectly dressed, but the bread tasted more stale than toasted, and the lobster-to-bread ratio was a bit low. 

For entrees my wife went with the king crab ramen w/ pork belly ($42) and I got the 45-day dry aged strip steak ($49). The ramen broth was awesome--not too salty, with the perfect amount of truffle. Unfortunately it was light on king crab considering the price, and the pork belly was somehow overcooked and tough, yet also too fatty and not seared at all. The steak, which was ordered medium-rare, came out a solid medium and the fingerling potatoes (all 2 of them) were cold. The server agreed and promptly put in another order. 2nd steak was perfectly cooked when I first cut into it, yet I quickly found out that one side of it was actually more overcooked than the first one. On the plus side, part of the steak was great and this time they added a few extra fingerling potatoes. But it definitely wasn't a $49 entree, so at that price it was very disappointing.

The server was extremely apologetic about the steak and the manager came over and also apologized, and even offered us a complimentary dessert to make up for it. We got the Milk and Cookies (normally $8), which was supposed to be a chewy and decadent chocolate chip cookie served in a mini cast iron pan, and so rich and delicious that it comes with a small carafe of farm fresh milk. However it came out luke warm, overcooked, and honestly no tastier than a tollhouse cookie. At that point when they asked how dessert was, we just lied and said it was good. I was tired of complaining and my wife was embarrassed.

Why 3 stars when we clearly weren't impressed with the food? Because the service was good, they owned up to their mistakes, the menu and flavors were both strong, and the ambience and view were top notch. The kitchen simply didn't execute, which in the end can make or break your entire meal."}
{"text":"Was here for a friend's bridal shower dinner, loved it!!!
Al bring my husband back for our anniversary."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to our first visit to Fahrenheit after it came highly recommended. I reserved in advance and requested a seat near the window since I was excited for the view of Charlotte since I am from out of the state. We arrived and were seated promptly at a seat three tables deep away from the window. We were informed the entire window area had been bought out. Our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Just as our meals arrived the group who bought out every window facing table arrived. At least 32 people in the dining room after already loosening up and getting loud at the bar. It was ear piercingly loud and my husband and I couldn't even think, let alone converse. I felt bad for another couple we saw arrive and get seated directly next to them trying to celebrate a special occasion. Aside from that I just didn't get the the food flavors. I'm not a picky eater, but the shirt rubbed steamed buns and chorizo stuffed figs were just a combination of string flavors I didn't think complimented each other. We also ordered the nachos, which was a ginormous plate of potato chips with a tiny bit of cheese and some sparingly added pieces of bacon, for about $14. All in all disappointed that this was our experience here on our trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review but I have to say we had great service!  Casey was very attentive.  I had the salmon and it was amazing!  The drinks were really good as well!  I would definitely come back here.  Live for t!"}
{"text":"From the elevator to the table, through the entire experience, it was the worst possible service. Rude hostess, slack server. Overpriced, underwhelming."}
{"text":"First off, SCALLOPS! Scallops are my go-to entree, and Fahrenheit's are the best I've had in town, no exaggeration.  They are served with a cauliflower purée, arugula, and pomegranate seeds, and they are delicious .  Every time.  Even during restaurant week, when perfection is practically unheard of."}
{"text":"We came in Saturday night to find they were having a power outage but the kitchen was still open but there were no lights or a/c. To entice us to stay the first round of drinks was on us, we weren't going to leave anyway so that was a huge bonus and about an hour into our meal the power came back on. 

There were 4 of us and we shared 4 appetizers to start the spring rolls, the meatballs, the calamari and the bacon wrapped dates. All of the appetizers were phenomenal, each had their own identity and were well seasoned and presented. My favorite was the Calamari, it was cooked to perfection.

For my entree I chose the  Shrimp Pasta special that night, it was in a cream sauce with truffle oil pasta and mushrooms, it was outstanding, I had to force myself not to eat it all cause I was remarkably full at that point. Everyone else loved their entrees as well and the price was not too bad either. We greatly enjoyed our experience here, despite the heat from the power being off and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night. We had terrible service. The drinks were fine, the food wasnt bad. The music was loud-ish. Atmosphere was hip and trendy. You can also sit outside on the large/long patio which has amazing views of the city."}
{"text":"The food was good.  But the place needs to work on customer service.  

There's no dress code here, but if they don't like what you're wearing (in this case a button down shirt and shorts), you're falsely told there are only seats available in the bar (the gal at the desk wasn't even subtle about it).  

The young boy bartender couldn't be bothered to take our order on time on check on our food or on us.  Twice we had to find him to ask for follow up service.  He spent a lot of time with knitted brow making and remaking drinks, testing and retesting each one.  

Being a customer here requires a lot of work and patience."}
{"text":"If you have friends in town, this is one of the spots that it is highly recommended that you take them too. It is touristy and to an extent cliché, but nonetheless a tantalizing experience. The drinks are above average, can't say the same about the food, but the spectacular view of the Charlotte Skyline paired with a beautiful day is enough to keep you coming back and warrant a 4/5 rating. Drinks are pricy, but as you would imagine you are being charged for the view."}
{"text":"I will have to try this place again when it is not restaurant week. It's sad when the best thing about the restaurant is the view of the city, it's truly amazing. I'm sure restaurant week is like the black Friday of shopping, people who would never eat here do and the bills are not as high so the regular waitstaff doesn't want to work it. I can totally understand that. 

So we will start this review off with service: our waiter was sub par to say it nicely. Slow with service, and just not attentive. He even made a comment that I drink water like a fish but would never fill my water. Now I'm new to the south, it is hot and I do drink a lot of water. It's fine to comment on that but at least fill my glass. We ordered our meals and then he later came back saying that steaks can only be served medium well because it is restaurant week, I like mine mooing and my friend likes it medium rare so we changed our dish. I understand it's easier for them to do this and I have no problem with that but I would think 4 or 5 days into it the waitstaff would know. Our waiter must have put in our full meal at once because our desserts were the first thing to arrive at our table. We later found out he's usually a bartender and waiting tables is not his favorite.... really? I couldn't tell...

Food: I'm a foodie, and I'm proud of it. There was nothing I was overly thrilled with but the steak that I stole a bite off of my friends plate ;) Which came out medium rare.... I'm not saying anything was bad, it was not but I was more impressed with the flavors of cabo fish taco than I was with anything I ordered. The calimari was good, the kobi braised beef lacked flavor but the flavors of the lo mein seemed to make up for it. 

Atmosphere: It does have the most amazing views of the city. It does also have views of the people getting in and out of the hotel pool next door.... which can be a little awkward to say the least. Inside it is loud, you have to yell over everyone else to hear the other people at the table. The decor was fine, but I haven't been to a fine dining with plastic table mats before.

All in all: I did have a fun girls night out but it was more on the company I was with than the service provided. Hopefully I will go back again and have to rewrite this review saying I was amazed with the regular staff, the food was to die for, and I cannot wait to go back again. Until then I'll probably just go back for cocktails and enjoy the view..."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. We went on a Monday night for a friends birthday at 8PM and it took over 2.5 hours! None of us had eaten here before and none of us will be back after this experience. The waitress was rude and would disappear for 20 minutes at a time. We had to flag someone else down every time we needed something. This may be a cool place to get drinks because of the view but I DO NOT recommend eating here. Be prepared to shell out a ridiculous amount of money with very rude service. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Went in November to celebrate three birthdays.  Our group of four were all new to Fahrenheit, so we had no idea what to expect.

And holy crap. What a pleasant surprise.  If we had expectations, they would have been blown right away. From the start of the meal to the very end, everything was food bliss. At face value, some of the dishes sounded basic - but the expect preparation of these \"simple\" dishes made them extraordinary.  

Meatballs as an appetizer. Absurdly tasty. Cleveland nachos.  I made a scene by licking the bowl and I didn't care. And the entrees.  Oh, the entrees. One party member got a pork special. SO GOOD.  The pizzas? crisp, delicious, well balanced, cheesy. The beef tenderloin - perfectly cooked over amazing potatoes.  Just the best version of comfort food you could possibly dream up. 

This is all build up to what I got. The 18 hour pork shank. I pulled the two bones out of the meat with zero resistance and laid the clean bones aside. I prepared my first bite and knew I was in for something good. As I started to chew, I closed my eyes, blocked out the world, and immediately began whispering blasphemous things to myself.  This continued between each alternating bite of food and sip of bourbon. So damn good. The honey marscapone polenta took it right to the edge of being too decadent, but stopped right at the peak of deliciousness. I'm not territorial around food, but it was hard for me to share this with the others at my table. 

The desserts were also on point. The peanut butter tart was just a peanut butter lover's dream.  (My wife, for example.) I'm not one for sweets, but I ate my fair share of that dessert.

Amazing food. There were a few issues with our service.  Sure, it was a busy Saturday night, but drinks from the bar, (especially on my birthday!), shouldn't take 25 minutes.  (Especially when the drink is bourbon in a glass or a beer. By the way, nice selection on both. Great Lakes Christmas Ale on top in Cleveland is a must have for this time of year.) In the absence of bar drinks, the water should be at least attended to.  I spent over 25 minutes without a beverage and watching everyone else enjoy their wine.  Next time, I'll just get a bottle of wine for myself, perhaps.

Still, this food was absurdly good.  We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Um it was okay. Nothing to brag about.. service was trash. They didnt even greet me and my party when we walked in. The good side. My drink was good, the food was good and the atmosphere was pretty good. The view from the rooftop was cute. Lol Cute date spot. Prices are $12-$20 for cocktail drinks.."}
{"text":"A Rocco Walen restaurant opens up in the heart of the downtown district sitting on the 22nd floor of the newly opened Hyatt. The expansive layout is decorated with a modern contemporary twist. We went there with a few friends for the friends and family soft opening and the night went well overall. Cocktails are decent. They have a nice selection or local brews. As for the menu, it's definitely pricey but not a surprise given the phenomenal location with sweeping views of downtown Charlotte. The flat bread pizza were delicious. Vegetables, meats and cheese of high quality were used. The tuna in crispy wonton was also but be warned, the chili sauce on top of it was fire!! For entrees had the bone in rib eye which was flavorful but a little over cooked. My friends had the lobster Mac and cheese, seared tuna, the Kobe short ribs and pork shank. All in all the food was very flavorful and delicious. There were some execution errors on a few but that is expected with a restaurant that just opened its door doing their first test run. Would I recommend this restaurant?!! Of course, I'm sure Rocco and staff will get the kinks worked out very soon and the food will be on point. As for the place to seen and be seen, I think Charlotte has just recently opened up its new location with Fahrenheit."}
{"text":"I was nervous considering some of the other recent reviews but I have wanted to visit the rooftop since we moved to the area 2 years ago so I was willing to risk it.

My husband and I had reservations for 6:30 and arrived around 6:15. We checked in at the front and headed outside to see the view. The bar area is really lively (loud) with lots of after-work friends chatting and sports on TV. 

The rooftop is fantastic at sunset. There are two, large gas fireplaces to stand near in cold weather. A nice stranger took our photo with the city in the background and we headed back inside to sit at the bar and wait on our table. At 6:30 my husband went back up to the hostess stand and we were seated immediately.

Our table in the dining area had a great view and was in a much quieter part of the restaurant. Our server was excellent. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and told us how much he loved working there. He said they give their employees holidays off and treat them well.

The Food:
We ordered the Crispy Tempura Rock Shrimp (sweet/savory) and Roasted Cauliflower Steak (flavorful and spicy) apps. Both were good and large portions. However my husband's dish was too cold and mine was just right temperature-wise. (Honestly we could have just had these and two salads and been full!)

I got the Pan Seared Salmon. The fish was good but had started to cool off a bit, the brussel sprouts were hot and the puree was cold. Maybe it was supposed to be but I prefer my entire meal to be warm ;-) 

My husband said his short ribs were just too salty. He was so full from the appetizer that he took most of it home.

Even though we were full we split the Candy Bar dessert. It was good but it was crazy-sweet! Great for you if you really like chocolate.

A good experience with the exception of the temp of our entrees. I guess they need to work on getting the food out at the right temperature. I may try it again when the weather warms up and we can eat outside."}
{"text":"The manager is great! She knew that we were in town for a bit and she moved us so that we could sit by the window. She also gave our table some avocado appetizers and made sure that we got vegetarian menus! 

Louis, who took our drink orders and stopped by sporadically, was very nice and charismatic. He was able to give us recommendations on where to go out later and he was just generally nice to talk to. Our waitress was also nice, but not as personable. 

We had two appetizers- an avocado bread spread, and nachos (potato chips drizzled in cheese with scallions). They also brought us pretzel bread with garlic butter. Everything was so good, I was almost full by the time we got our actual food. 

I got the arugula pizza and the Charlotte's Wedge salad, and split both with a friend. The salad was tiny, but the pizza was huge! Between the two of us, we finished the salad and took half the pizza home with us. It was all really good! 

The view was also great, and a ton of people were on the patio taking photos. I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"As many reviewers suggest, the VIEW is the only thing Fahrenheit has to offer. As the please lacks in food, drinks and even service! 
Food-had several dinners there, and have never walked away impressed. They even managed to make pizza \"sort of, kind of\" blah, or coat decent scallops with sause reminiscent of \"less than\" Hellmann's mayonnaise... 

Drinks-honestly, has anybody ever had a cocktail there, that did not taste like a window cleaner? Regardless the menu description, they all come out tasting Windex like. I was there with a decent group of friends, and we literally had one of each cocktail on the menus at our table-all equally shitty. Promptly switched to wine. 

Service-here comes my \"favorite\" part of Fahrenheit! One thing the place stays consistent at-crappy service. Seriously, I take quests from out of town there all the time (damn you, the view!) and I have even started telling people to looooooower their expectations))))) 

My recent experience has actually prompted my to finally write this review. So here it is."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a huge disappointment.  I prepared for a memorable experience and boy did I get one. I was with a group of four and we had reservations.  Our table had a nice view except for the fact that the setting sun was in my eyes for a while.  We sat for easily 20 minutes before we flagged someone down to bring us some drinks. No one acknowledged our presence. This was a Sunday for goodness sake at 7:00 for goodness sake. They weren't that busy! So drink orders placed now our server shows up. She seemed nice but not apologetic for her absence. We all got some variation of the Moscow Mule and all were good. We ordered the Carolina Nachos for the table. Everyone seemed to order them around us too. I thought they were so-so. A better pimento cheese was needed in my opinion. The biggest problem with our meal was the service. It was just not on par with $40 entrees. It was not on par with $10 entrees. It was awful and ruined the experience for all of us. The food was pretty good. My date and I split the avocado  and cucumber salad and the mushroom pizza. The salad was great but the pizza was mediocre. The service was so bad that my boyfriend finally went to speak with a manager. She must have spoke to our server but she did not have it in her to bring the server back up to par. The worst part was the manager did nothing else. She didn't even stop by the table! The meal ended with a comedy of errors with the check. The view was nice. I might go back for drinks but not going to risk it for dinner again."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and simple...the description on the menu is not as amazing amazing as you might think. 

Ordered:
-ahi poke nachos 
 (The ration of poke and fried wontons was totally off)
-kale & Brussels sprout salad 
 (Very strong vinegary taste. The dried cranberry helped but there wasn't much off the in the dish.)
-peach &a and blackberry cobbler w/ ice cream
 (The ice cream scoop was so small. By the time it got to me, it was already half way melting. Couldn't even enjoy the ice cream. The over dessert was....OK to say the least.)

Server was good. Could of been better but everyone has a good and bad day. Overall, I think you're paying for the view and not so much the food."}
{"text":"Come for the expensive view, not for the slow service or outdated menu. 

The decor and menu haven't been updated since the late 90s and the smell of the dining room is a testament to that. I've seen more inspired menus in remote locations of Upstate NY than this metropolitan restaurant has to offer. While it is thoughtful of them to have one, the gluten free menu isn't even accurate! 

Not only is the service slow, the server isn't educated on his menus nor does he return with answers to your questions. Dessert menus had to be asked for AFTER a birthday dessert was served and it had melted long before anyone else at the table was served."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit does it right. Great food with a great atmosphere, could you ask for anything else. Went to Fahrenheit tried a little bit of everything and loved it all. This is the type of place you can be in jeans or a suit and still feel welcome. Great in spot in Tremont."}
{"text":"This was my third time at Fahrenheit - and my second time enjoying happy hour. 

What I have most enjoyed is the service. Everyone is consistent and attentive. 

I'd recommend everything I've tasted off of the happy hour menu - Shrimp tacos, cheese steak sandwich, and fries were all fantastic. If you're not picky about wine - $4 for a glass of house white/red is a great deal. 

If you're going for dinner, it's going to be great. I went in the winter time when Fahrenheit took part in the Taste of Cleveland. They offered discounts on bottles of wine that paired nicely with a small selection of $30 three course meals which consisted of an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I ordered Grilled Salmon and it was cooked perfectly. The wasabi mashed potatoes were fun - I only wished they had more kick to them.

The boyfriend ordered the Chorizo Stuffed Sweet Dates as an appetizer - these were incredible! What is there to NOT love about bacon-wrapped dates? His entree was the Kobe Beef Short Ribs - he licked the plate clean - it smelled delicious and his mushrooms were heaven. 

(The brain fails me - I can't remember what we got for dessert.)

The selections for both happy hour and dinner have been around for quite a while. The ingredients are fresh, but the selections are not. As more restaurants continue to open that offer locally grown, high-quality, farm fresh ingredients, I think it's going to be harder for a place like Fahrenheit to compete if they don't get out of the box of offering  their \"long-standing favorites\". At the very least, they need to provide a short list of menu items/specials that can be improvised daily. I find myself easily getting bored with the same old thing. So many neat Cleveland restaurants are popping up and I'm being pulled to explore new things and spend my money in other restaurants that offer an experience that I haven't had before."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Fahrenheit during restaurant week and perhaps that impacted our experience. We arrived promptly and decided to grab a drink at the bar while our friends arrived - lively bar scene and good cocktail menu. The atmosphere is very \"high end hotel restaurant\" somewhat bland, lots of glass to take advantage of the view and a ton of fireplaces. Not bad but also not really unique. 

Once we were seated we were shown the menu - our waiter was solid but obviously was looking to upsell the regular menu. Two members of our group have allergies so they ordered off the regular menu and the kitchen was VERY flexible and helpful in identifying ingredients and tailoring their meals. For the rest of us it was straight-forward.

My biggest issue is with the food itself - while the menu highlights the complexity of ingredients (ie local beets and pickled ginger) the actual product does not reflect that complexity in taste. The calamari was average at best, the hanger steak nothing exceptional (and the portion size was VERY small). Deserts were good but again lack imagination. 

Perhaps this is because they are trying to contain costs during Restaurant Week. However, if the intention is to bring diners to the restaurant so that they come back, why scale back the tastes and portion sizes? Finally, we were annoyed that they tacked on a 22% tip for our party of six - while our server did point it out to us, it seems odd to do this for a small group. 

Overall there are much better options in Charlotte - we went to Carpe Diem last week during restaurant week and had a stellar experience, much better than this. Other than the view, this is not a place to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Fahrenheit !! The drinks were fabulous. The atmosphere was perfect - the view is the best part.what a perfect place for date night. A very romantic environment !"}
{"text":"The food and service at the bar was great.....the girl that quoted a 2 hour wait at the host stand was real salty.....especially since the restaurant was half full...#fakewait"}
{"text":"Last night we took two of our Creative Executives from NYC to Fahrenheit to prove that that Cleveland has some hot spots - and must say, we succeeded! The service was wonderful, and the food was fantastic!

The largest surprise of the evening were the Nacho's - which are homemade potato chips with a goat cheese sauce, bacon, chives and scallions.  Sounds like an odd choice, but wonderful!

Three of us tried the house speciality - the Kobe Beef Short Ribs (definately would recommend).  The guest who was most impressed had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin and said that, \"it's better than any steak I've had in NYC.\"  You heard it here folks - Cleveland cuisine trumps NYC!  

The only reason I'm keeping it away from 5 stars, is because I wish they would expand and get more creative with the dessert options.  The entire meal was fantastic, but didn't quite end with a dessert bang like I hoped it would.  I should have just ordered the Peanut Butter Cup Martini and called it a night."}
{"text":"This was my second visit there - this time only to the bar to take an out of town guest. 
The view is great.  
The service was horrible as was the first time I went.  We sat at the bar for drinks.  After sitting a while, we tried to flag a server(male) down to get a drink. He looked directly at us and did not come over. When he finally did, he was unfriendly and NEVER smiled. We asked for a menu and it was just about thrown at us.  
There was a girl at the bar who finally came over  and helped us. She was nice and better.  The 2 men working the bar were both unfriendly.  
I called earlier in the day to ask what train stop was closest to 
 the restaurant and was told by a young lady to \" google it.\"   Seems in order to work there you must be unfriendly.  
Go for the view and expect nothing else!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place a better rating, truly, I do. And I've given it chance after chance. Tonight was my third time eating here and despite making a reservation, we were not sat for another hour and 10 minutes. We got drinks at the bar, which we waited 20 minutes alone just for someone to say something to us, AT THE BAR. But I give the place 3 stars, actually 3.5 because the view is unbeatable, honestly. And the food truly is good. But the price is insane because there IS better. I keep coming back because of the view and ideal location for birthdays and holidays, but boy do they make it tough sometimes."}
{"text":"Terrific ambiance! Drinks are somewhat overpriced but the food is excellent and worth the value. We went for Restaurant Week and got 3 courses for something around $30 and all 3 courses were cooked to perfection and delicious. I would definitely recommend this as a first stop when you get to the city!"}
{"text":"Sweet Baby Jesus! What an excellent experience! Fahrenheit was our chosen place for July Supper Club and it did not disappoint! We had 19 guests and I heard not one negative thing.

To start, I had met Chef Rocco at the Chef's Tasting Panel event hosted by Engage Cleveland and he definitely was a huge help in making sure our event turned out great (people get out there and socialize with your local businesses! Connect with your community!). Through his assistant Amber I was able to plan the supper club and have it in the private dining section of the restaurant. We even scored happy hour deals that are usually only available at the bar. So what I am saying is, while I was sent a scary looking contract, I would highly recommend you give management a call because they will definitely work with you and try to meet your needs the best they can. 

Day of we received awesome service from Jill who took great care of us even though we were a large group and everyone was on separate checks (did not mind at all that automatic 20% gratuity added to our bills). There was one older lady who did not seem the most pleasant even though I tried to joke with her, but eh, maybe she just has a standoffish personality or was overwhelmed by our group. We only saw her at the beginning so it was no big deal. 

For food everyone ordered different things from happy hour pizza and tacos, to the Cleveland nachos or grilled avocado for a starter, to fancy short ribs or seared tuna for dinner, and chocolate mouse for dessert. Wine and sangria's were also flowing. Our group was even lucky enough to receive a surprise tasting of cheesesteaks and chicken spring rolls! Yum Yum Yum! 

I personally got the Cleveland nachos $14.75 and it was a HUGE portion and more than plenty to share with the entire group! It's homemade potato chips covered in cheese cause, bacon and scallions. For a main dish I got the Ohio pork shank $30, the pork was tender and you could easily pull it apart. The honey and mascarpone polenta added a sweet touch to balance out the dish. Dessert was the peanut butter tart; basically PB, chocolate, pretzels all fancy. I definitely had leftovers and the dessert took me three days to eat because it was so rich and full of awesome that you were satisfied with only a couple of bites at a time. Oh and my red sangria was good and strong so be prepared! 

Overall we had a fantastic time talking and eating leisurely. We were able to try a variety of dished and I thought this was perfect as most of our group had never been to Fahrenheit before. I know I will definitely be coming back! This place is great for a drink with co-workers, a fancy date night, or even for groups celebrating good food!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. However the service and lack of customer experience brings this restaurant to the bottom of the barrel."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I could stop there. The service was average. The food was good, I had the kale salad and we all split a few appetizers. I would say the bacon wrapped stuffed dates are a must!!! The short ribs (that I snuck a bite of) were fabulous as well. Food and drinks are slightly overpriced probably due to the location. Parking is confusing and valet is recommended. I wouldn't suggest to go back because there are so many great restaurants in Charlotte that provide the entire package. It would help if there staff smiled a tad bit more."}
{"text":"Celebrated my girlfriend's 30th birthday here a couple of weeks ago. We reserved a table for 15 and was seated without any issues. As far as service, it was ok but could have been better (not horrible by any means) in order to accommodate everyone timely. This place has a view of downtown like no other place in Charlotte. It's amazing.

As far as dinner, it was ok. I had the short rib which looks really good but was just ok. The Bday girl really enjoyed her meal, which was the grilled salmon, so that's all that matters :)  Others had the pizza too. Fyi, that pizza is really huge lol. Two people can eat on that. From what I heard, they liked it as well. 

After having dinner we lounged, had drinks, and just enjoyed the view. That was the main event and it didn't disappoint.  Nonetheless we had a great time."}
{"text":"Great food . Great staff . Very nice atmosphere inside and on the patio out front .

George Bruce the GM suggested the grilled avocado appetizer and it was great . So were the spring rolls . Seared Tuna entree was prepared perfectly . 

Lastly , the bartender has fun creating unique drinks . Tonight we had a drink called Buttons and Cuffs . So Comfort w lemonade , fresh lemon and a splash of peach schnapps . Very tasty ! Well done Trevor ."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned about the reviews but I had a great experience here.  Both food and service was good.  My only complaint is that it felt like they forgot to turn on the air conditioning.  We literally sweated through dinner.  Great views of Charlotte!  I had the salmon and my husband had the pad thai - both were very good!"}
{"text":"The only time I have ever walked out of a restaurant because the service was so bad. Three of us sat in the bar area at a table since we didn't have a reservation. No one ever wiped down our dirty table. We asked the waitress for dinner menus. She brought us one. We asked for some bread to start our meal and she brought it after the second time we asked for it. We ordered our food and did not even receive bread plates or silverware to spread our butter. I walked to the bar to ask for some. Bartender brings us plates and three forks. No napkins or knives. Great we get to spread our butter with forks. We ask her for more butter and she replies very rudely wanting to know what else we need. I said well hey some knives would be great. At this point we wait five minutes for her to return and decide to leave. I will never return here for dinner. Horrible experience. Not worth paying $45 a steak. The only thing they have going is their view from the 21st floor. Get your shit together Fahrenheit."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Bread is served warm with honey chive butter. We ordered pork shank and pork tenderloin, both entrees were good and tender. Great for alfresco dining. Lovely waitress."}
{"text":"We got there and saw several empty tables, while the hostess told us let me check I don't think we have any tables, walked away came back and said oh we do! so we sat down, ordered an appetizer (humus) - good, ordered a few beers, they were out of pizza dough and we only came to try the pizza so we ordered a few more beers, and the thing of fries (ehh) and nachos (which was actually potato chips with cheese - good) price was good. place was pretty fancy and pretty packed with people, service was average."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place! Very crowded so you know it's good!! Try the Cleveland nachos. You can't go wrong. Along with the dates, and spring rolls. Amazing! Looking forward to going back. :)"}
{"text":"How did I not know they have bacon on the bar as finger food during happy hour? Let me state that again, BACON!!! That alone would be enough reason to come back again and again! The food and drinks were lovely, the bartender charming and my company was exceptional, so all and all, it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Charlotte offers one of the most beautiful skylines in the country, and the view from Fahrenheit is worth the visit alone! This place was packed on a Wednesday night, drinks are a little on the high end, but it's worth it- go! Can't wait to go back and actually try the food!"}
{"text":"The only reason the rating is low is because the happy menu is overly priced for the amount of food.  The screen and vibe is Amazing. Very relaxed and chilled. I went for happy hour. I ordered there wings. The were so small that I couldn't ever taste the meat. Don't order them. Its a east of money. They should be 3 bucks but the charge is around 10."}
{"text":"Nice venue and great overlook of the city! The Bank of America Stadium is next door which is home to the Carolina Panthers (go Panthers!) :)"}
{"text":"This will be a short review as I was only there for a short drink.  Definitely want to go back and try the food as a few other patrons were eating some tasty looking dishes.  I had a chocolate old fashioned which was made to perfection with the addition of cocoa nibs.. The view was awesome over the city and skyline, patio was awesome!  Can't wait to go back, this would be another \"bring the outta towners to\" to showcase our beautiful, amazing city!  It's a tad pricey but it's expected for the cool atmosphere, paying for experience a bit which they seem to deliver on my first take"}
{"text":"More to be desired but beautiful panoramic view of Charlotte skyline.  I experienced poor customer service and my food was cold. The waiter said that he was cut and handed us off to someone else but he was still on the clock."}
{"text":"This was probably one of my fave nightlife spots in my weekend visit in NC, and it was at my hotel!  Haha :P

I did like the view here a lot, as well as the nice fire outside!  Though it was a bit chilly, we took our drinks outside and hung out by the fire and had a great time.  I had the aviation drink which was pretty solid, as well as some fries later on to satisfy my late night munchies :P"}
{"text":"I came here last year and got the lamb ragout pasta (I don't think it's still on the menu) which was delicious and rich. We also got the strip steak with fries, also great. The servings were pretty big and the drinks were pretty strong.. Overall a great night"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner today. Our waiter was cool, but the main issue was our food. We had a few vegetarians in the group, and they specifically asked for meatless options. Picked a kimchi fried rice, and of course it came out with sausage pieces in it. Being vegetarian they initially thought they may have been mushrooms but then after a few bites asked a non veg to try it and lo and behold, it was pork sausage. When we told the waiter he was embarrassed as if he forgot to tell the kitchen staff in the first place, and then a manager came over the apologize and sneeringly offered some sort of percent discount off of our meal without even trying to listen to our concerns, kinda rude."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for their happy hours and I love it! What stands out the most about their happy hour is they give you free bacon as you're having your drinks. Such a unique touch. I also love their happy hour menu. I've had their shrimp tacos, crisp vegetables, fries and happy hour pizza. All have been amazing!! The pizza is unique with maple and brie. It's a cute little spot that is great for some after work drinks and foods. The happy hour prices are very reasonable compared to their regular menu which is a little pricer, but I hope to try it one day."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is the pubescent teenager of Charlotte restaurants. Loud, confused, and most of all, unpredictable. One night it will be throwing a house party; Katy Perry blasting, drunk kids everywhere, selfies being taken in every corner. Another night it will throw on a suit and try to impress the girlfriend's parents; more professional crowd, subtle music flowing throughout, wine tasting/pairing events, business dinners. 

It's frustrating because this place can deliver; but management is trying to run a nightclub and fine dining restaurant in the same space. Fahrenheit needs to decide what it wants to be when it grows up. Judging by the declining reviews, they need to do so quickly. 

Feel like rolling the dice? Give Fahrenheit a try and cross your fingers that you end up at a place emulating Bentley's and not Suite."}
{"text":"Food is barely subpar. I wouldn't return if it wasn't for the view. I'll grab a drink to sit outside and leave. The food is over priced and barely worth the taste. The filet mignon was barely a steak. It was more of a dabble in an over cooked and salted piece of meat. There's no way I would eat here again. I'm sorry I cheated on 131 Main and tried something different. I could get the same level of service from my local Applebee's"}
{"text":"The lamb special was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The lobster macaroni and cheese was ideal confort food. The short rib pizza flavor was ridiculously good."}
{"text":"So, I didn't have really high hopes for this place going in because a lot of the reviews I read were mediocre to good .. but not like GREAT.

I would say this place is great.  Maybe I lucked out with my order?  I sat at the bar and had appetizers and drinks.  We asked the bartender what was good and he directed us to a number of appetizers/small plates that were insanely delicious!  If you go, try at least one of either the chorizo bacon wrapped dates and/or the sweet potato biscut with lobster (both were fantastic).  Then on the ligher side we also tried to seared tuna wontons, which were less rich but equally good.

Obviously, atmosphere at this place cannot be beat, you can see the entire city skyline.  Gorgeous, especially now that it's summer and the weather is so nice in the evenings."}
{"text":"This brunch was incredibly unimpressive. The service was great, but the food was so basic. I paid 13.50 for three egg whites mixed with spinach and one piece of chicken sausage. Nothing was special about it at all. This was called \"eat clean, train dirty\" and 95% of my plate was just toast. This was such a rip off; disappointed that a restaurant with such a great reputation had such a limited menu and such disappointing food. I don't think anyone in my party was impressed."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's Day brunch.   $42 a person.  Delicious.   Also went for happy hour (5pm-7pm).  Delicious!   Highly recommend it.  Happy hour: drinks $5.  Burgers, huge pizza, shrimp tacos, cheesteak all for $6-$8.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived early on a busy Saturday night. Parking is a bear in tremont. Even with Valet I waited for 10 minutes as my wife checked in. I can't imagine this is a one night problem being the first weekend in February.  Unfortunately the table we where waiting for decided to sit after paying. I'm not a dick but thee is a unwritten rule that 5 minutes after paying the bill you leave, or the hostess should move them on nicely. Having said that we waited 20 min past our reservation. 
Now for the good stuff. I explained this to our waitress who knew we where hungry and wanted to place our order. The food was spaced quickly and efficiently. Kiddos to the back room. The food was amazing. We had the calamari warm salad it's a must.   We both had fish entrees my halibut was much better then the tuna. Great flavor could have done with less carrots. The tuna was good but we have had better. Again the waitress did a great job to make a bad start and relaxing enjoyable dinner. Will be back when the weather is warmer so we don't mind parking so we don't have to wait for valet."}
{"text":"Great location and great views. Food is creative.  Imaginative dishes - flavors mix very nicely. Grilled avocado is awesome!  Informal atmosphere feels relaxed.  

Expensive!  Courses and drinks add up fast.  Steak was slightly overcooked.  I would do it again but there are better values to be found."}
{"text":"First visit in over five years.  Nice menu and it was nice to see Chef Rocco add lite offerings to his menu.  Service was attentive and timely.  Great appetizers.  The edamame potstickers are unique and tasty.  The lite tuna salad was good, but lacked a little imagination.  The scallops were huge and flavorful.  The lite pork chops were tasty and portions were generous.  Extensive wine list and full bar.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"I had to plan my best friends surprise birthday party at the last minute. It seemed like everywhere was way over booked and could not seat a party of simply 5. I called and hey were like sure come on in! Fahrenheit is always a great place to go celebrate any type of event. Great atmosphere and they have a really great drink menu. I love their ahi tuna tacos too"}
{"text":"Sunday midday brunch led me to check this place out. The inside setting was pretty nice and the brunch menu itself had a good number of choices to choose from. During this visit I ordered the breakfast nachos to be shared amongst the table of  6 which was just the right amount. It's a very generous portion that I'd recommend is best shared. Also a better suited description for the breakfast \"nachos\" is breakfast \"potato chips\" as they are more similar to potato chips than what you would think of as nachos.  

Moving on the my main course, i ordered the caramel apple and bourbon waffle. It came pre cut in triangular pieces. I think the waffle itself was decent however I don't think it will be something I'd order again. Of course it boils down to personal preference but I found it to be a bit tough. I'd like to give this place another shot to try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Kalon is AWESOME!!!  Kalon went out of the way to make our night so much fun!!  Great drinks and food.  Interesting food combinations.The views are amazing."}
{"text":"I have been living in Charlotte little over 5 months. Fahrenheit was the first restaurant my wife and I dined in uptown. The view is spectacular. The drinks are a bit pricey but fair due to the location. (Just moved back down South from NYC) so this is common.  We have been back 4 times since then. I feel that the food varies between a 3-4.5 star depending on what you get.  But then last week happened.                                                              
I had my sister and her husband visiting so we decided to take them over to Fahrenheit. Everything went placid as usual. Both the wife and sister had the seared tuna. And both got sick over night. It could not be the alcohol since they both had two glasses of winE throughout the whole night uptown.
I called to let them know in a professional manner about what had happened & what could be done about it. The manager completely discarded my call by giving me the chefs credentials and that there is no way they have ever had any complaints since they opened?
So basically they are impeccable and the customer is always wrong. Could not care less. She said that the GM would call me later in the afternoon but never happened. Now I firmly understand that this establishment sees people as quantity rather than with courtesy."}
{"text":"Never again!  My wife and I met another couple for dinner and drinks.  Started with a drink, moved to a salad, entree, and dessert.  When my wife asked for coffee the server asked us to leave because a party was waiting for our table.  Are you kidding me?  #1 we weren't just sitting and not eating or drinking and #2 how rude.  We spent $256 and were asked to leave?  I've told the story to many people and nobody can believe it.  It's true and we will NEVER return.  Trust me, there are MANY good restaurants in Cleveland.  We'll spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good food, but a bit overpriced and our server was not very attentive.  The view is unbeatable, but the overall experience didn't live up to the hype I had heard about.  I will go back someday, but it won't be a regular spot of mine any time soon."}
{"text":"Great food with an even greater view, that was only diminished by the loud noisy environment. Perfect service."}
{"text":"This review is strictly on drinks. I had been seeing amazing pictures all over instagram and finally made my way over here with a friend who was visiting from out of state. We arrived and took the elevator up at about 2 on a Sunday and they close for the afternoon at 2:30. We went to the bar and I ordered a mimosa and my friend got a Moscow Mule. Both drinks were made beautifully but for a hefty bill. We headed outside through the door by the bar and straight away the beautiful fire on the patio reeked of gas, it did not smell safe. In general the turf out there made me feel like I was at a dog park and the seated area with mulch was not well taken care of, there were a bunch of weeds. Overall, this place is better on instagram. Great to come and see the view and take a picture, and I think the staff knows it. Really weird vibes from all of the employees, probably because they were about to close. While we were leaving an employee was telling a story about patrons (from what I could overhear) to two police officers, adding to the weird vibe. It was a very strange experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Fahrenheit 3 times now. This was my first time going during restaurant week and it was terrible. Our table was not ready at the time of our reservation, so we grabbed 2 drinks at the bar. Bartenders were very rude. Food was not up to par, not even worth the $35 menu for restaurant week. The short ribs were 50% fat. Desserts were dry. Also can't believe they don't have complimentary valet.... Only positive thing about this place is the view."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night
Food very good service was ok 3 out 4 of us received our
appetizers at the same time the fourth person took a while for them to bring their appetizer
Had a bottle of wine which was ok
Table we had was very nice
Disappointed that when we asked for bread we were 
told that during restaurant week they don't serve bread
I have lived here for 9 years and have dined out several times during restaurant week and this was first time I was 
told that
All in all the dining experience was good"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time for brunch and walked  out full. The taste wasn't all that I expected, and was a little more saltier than I would have like. The mimosas were great. The waiter was actually friendly and the view was everything. I think it's a place that is certainly worth the visit and the view. After brunch I spent a view minutes on the outdoor patio to really take in the view."}
{"text":"Delicious. Absolutely everything was fantastic. Spring rolls appetizer was light and awesome, what a combo of flavor! I got their deconstructed spicy tuna roll special (I don't remember the actual name), my husband got a lamb ramen special, the others tried Kobe beef and scallops. We all loved our dishes (and each other's too!).  One of the best new (to me) restaurants I have been to in a while. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Pros: A really great view. 

And that's it.

We went as a group of 5 adults for appetizers and drinks. 5pm on a Sunday night, with the place only 25% full inside. 

One of our party ordered one of the specialty martinis, which was recommended by our server. When the order was placed, the server returned to our table to report the bartender said they were out of one of the ingredients. So another recommendation for a different martini was made, and that was ordered as the replacement. A minute later and she's back to report that the bartender is out of one of the ingredients of the second martini ordered. I think ultimately a glass of wine was what this person had. 

The appetizers are sub-par by the standards of a church social potluck. Their total mediocrity wasn't helped by the fact they required a ridiculous amount of time to appear from the time they were ordered--remember, we are one of only two or three active tables inside the bar area at this time. 

I am pretty sure our server was high. I don't mean this as a joke--she had no attention span, no sense of urgency, and a complete inability to follow an order through to completion. I had to leave the table after waiting 20 minutes to find someone who could provide me with a Diet Coke that had been ordered. No apology, no sense of duty to serve the table. 

If you absolutely must go for the view, my suggestion is to limit your drink requirements to bottled beer. The price is lower than the mixed drinks, and because the bar staff apparently doesn't think it is important to keep the key ingredients on hand for an evening of serving drinks, there is low probability you'll get served your first request for a mixed drink--or even your second. Stick to the beer, which they are less likely to screw up. 

If for any reason you think I am being a dick about this, I do invite you to read the other reviews and see how often this restaurant and bar are called out for (A) slow, poor service, and (B) mediocre food. If I owned this dump and saw the negative reviews piling up as they are here, I would close for a week, fire everyone, and start over. Judging from the number of months the same complaints have been made, I don't think ownership is concerned about the guest experience, since they will continue to receive a steady stream of new customers because of the view--the one thing Fahrenheit hasn't screwed up. 

Yet."}
{"text":"The hostess was extremely condescending. Bad service. So bad that my girlfriend and I sat down and immediately decided to leave. Also, the view is way overrated. The food menu is extremely limited and costly."}
{"text":"I love Farenheit. I live in the neighborhood so I find every excuse possible to go in there. The chorizo stuffed dates are to die for. The bartenders are always very attentive and friendly, especially the gal with shortish black hair. The prices can be a teensy bit steep but I always feel like it's worth it when I taste how awesome whatever I ordered is."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and sat at the bar. The bartender was excellent and helped us make great selections from the menu. The pear Moscow mule was awesome as well. I cannot say a bad thing about the experience here. Everyone was friendly and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Great bartender. She was attentive, made a great drink! Amazing food- creative and delicious. Ambiance lovely for a cold evening."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch yesterday with a group of people. Brunch cocktails were on point (great way to start the meal). Got to meet the Chef too and he sent a few amazing appetizers out for the group (chocolate croissants and French toast with fruits). 
Ambiance was great and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. 
Then came my meal; fried chicken Benedict. The marmalade (pineapple and mango) was just so damn good. I think I might have been the only person that finished their entire meal at the table. 

I. WILL. BE. BACK."}
{"text":"Grilled Avocado was tasty, really just come here for apps, drinks, and view. Entrees are overpriced. Steak had so much char it's all I could taste. Decor feels tacky, and it's hella busy."}
{"text":"I was unimpressed.   So what your chef Rocco, the chef at Firebirds kicks your ass.  

The view, amazing.  You'll get over that in about 5 minutes.  

The lay out, awesome.   Great design, Open floor plan plus additional inside seating.  

Parking - a hassle

Service - small bar can't accommodate patrons, resulting in extreme waits for service.  (10 minutes per drink - 20 minutes to close tab)

Best view in the house is on the patio.  And I refuse to sit at a bar and eat a $45 steak.  

Drink Prices- ludicrous - Grey Goose Cosmo $19.  Ciroc rocks - $16.  

Food - Great tasting, tiny portions.   

This place will definitely have a CTJ meeting and revamp their entire philosophy, or it'll be dead in 6-months, or they'll shut down and reopen under than name Celsius."}
{"text":"I totally enjoyed my meals here at this neighborhood gem in Cleveland
After a great mixed drink the waiter gave us a red wine that went perfectly with the stack of homemade chips for appetizers and our meals . I liked the atmosphere in the restaurant as well . I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Portions were rather small for the price. Definitely pay for the rooftop atmosphere more than the food or service. Service was lacking from our waitress Nicole. Our glasses were mostly empty for our visit. Disappointing for a place of this caliber."}
{"text":"View is gr8- perfect spot to hang with friends! However the male bartender was very gruff and rude. He acted as if it was a chore to pour a glass of wine. May have spit in it. Not pleased. Drinks are extremely overpriced. But again, great view."}
{"text":"We had friends visiting from California and as they are huge music fans, we took them to the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame last Friday and spent an incredible six hours there. We left around 5:00pm, looking for a decent place for dinner, partly to stay out of the rush hour traffic, but also mainly because we were starving.

We asked a couple of employees of the R&R HOF for restaurant options and we were told to go over to 4th street, as there are plenty of good/great places located there. We figured out where 4th street was, (not far) and headed that way only to run into traffic that reminded us all of the SF/Bay area (UGH). To us, this was a huge turn off and it seemed like we were going nowhere fast. My wife (she's the smart one in the family) suggested we check our handy YELP app, to see if there were any other options and we quickly found our way to Professor Ave and to the Fahrenheit. 

We arrived close to 6:pm and the place was half full. The set up is cozy and looks slightly upper class, with a nicely dressed wait staff and fine art on the walls. Our waiter (George) appeared as if introduced and was not only extremely informed about the restaurant, the food they served and it's history, but was also very aware of the restaurant scenes in other cities as well. He was fun to talk to, treated us all like royalty and seemed to be very interested in all we had to say. People like him are what can make or break a restaurant and he definitely made our visit worthwhile.  

For starters we tried the Chorizo Stuffed Sweet Dates and the Slow Braised Pork Belly, both were excellent and disappeared in just a few minutes.

For our entrees, my wife ordered one of their specials, Duck with gnocchi and more. I went for the Hanger Steak with Fingerling Potatoes and green beans. Our friends each ordered the Pork Shank with Polenta and broccolini. All the food was delicious. I was issued a steak knife but never used it as my butter knife tore through that steak like it was a chain saw. Our usual over the top conversations were nullified by the food, a true testament to how good everything really was.

We did not order any dessert, as we were happily stuffed, (they do not skimp on the portent sizes). 

Because we found this restaurant by accident and because of the great day we had spent at the R&R HOF, I'd say our visit to Cleveland was a rousing success. We would assuredly return to this place if and when in Cleveland again and will recommend it to anyone headed that way.

Please give George a raise or a small trophy, as he deserves it!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Charlotte, I had seen plenty of pictures and heard plenty about Fahrenheit that I wanted to try it out myself. I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for my girlfriend and I and anticipated an amazing meal with a view. Once we got there, we were seated behind a wall and were unable to see anything. We were also placed under an air vent that kept us freezing cold the whole night. We also had to yell across the table to each other just so we could hear. 
Food-We ordered the Crunchy Shrimp Tempura for an appetizer and while it was good, it was at the table in 2 minutes. Our main entrees were also at our table less than 5 minutes after we ordered our food. I feel like these entrees are pre-made and then plated when you order. For the price, I expect a made to order meal. The portions were very small and once we received them, we knew we would be hungry afterward. I had the Ahi which was good, but I've had much better for less with sides I could actually enjoy. My girlfriend ordered the scallops which consisted of 3 scallops with a piece of cauliflower in between. Again, the food was good but we have had much better for less. The one portion of the meal that we were satisfied with was our dessert which was the blueberry lemon cheesecake. It was the best part of our meal which was reasonably priced.
The view on the outside patio afterward is amazing over the city but I will not be back for a meal. The bar and patio is the ideal place for drinks though. The food was good but should have been much better for the price."}
{"text":"Great place, brunch was fantastic for a Sunday afternoon, portions were gigantic and delicious! I had the Cap'n Crunch waffles, very tasty!"}
{"text":"Overrated!  Service missteps and noise level detracts and distracts from the food, which is above average.  Really, the only thing this place has going for it is location and skyline view, if your lucky enough to be seated anywhere near a view.  My wife made the reservation noting a special occasion. Our table(diner wobbly) was against a lighted column with a great view of another couple who was oddly seated against a outer wall beam.  Lots of glass available, but even their table didn't have a view.  Behind us was a large party which meant noise...understandable, but as the we waited to give our drink and app order the restaurant filled and the noise level went to 11.  The waitress had to bend down and basically yell.    Realizing this was not going to be an ideal/relaxing dinner we ordered a bottle of the Jordan$65...served a warm $115Jordan.  Not only was it warm, the waitress pretty much used our glasses as decanters...filled half way...couldn't swirl.  While observing other staff, it became obvious this was a very young, inexperienced group of people.  I ordered the short rib...good, but a garlic salt bomb which lingers until the next morning.  My wife ordered the porkchop...good but dry.  Dessert...ordered some type of chocolate pnutbutter ice cream candy bar that was delicious, but nothing signature or creative.  When it was time for the check the restaurant was at a roar.  I mean loud!  So much so, the waitress offered no pleasantries when delivering the check.  Super transactional feel.  I feel no need to return or bring clients.  It's a low-end establishment pretending to be a 5star, based on high $ cabs on the wine list.  Thankfully, CLT has much better dining experiences and close bye."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan but was beyond disappointed last night.  Our poor server couldn't get out of the weeds, so it took about 10 minutes to get a glass of water after being seated. I saw how this night was going to go so we ordered drinks and appetizers right away. Let's just say I was glad we had water to drink until the apps showed up. Appetizers, meatballs and bacon wrapped dates were excellent. The main course was disappointing, I felt like I was in my Irish grandmothers kitchen. The filet was overcooked, tough and flavorless. One veggie was overcooked and one was undercooked and flavorless. Our bread basket was came half way trough dinner service. Let's just say we were ready to walk to the Flying Monkey to get our drinks to go, and bring back to Fahrenheit with our dinner.  The manager walked around and smiled saw our plates from the apps, clearly long gone sitting there and empty drink and water glasses. No reaction.  

I  nicely let our waitress know how disappointing it was and she explained they lost cooks after RNC , were new, were training on the job, etc. she apologized, took the filet off our bill. It wasn't her fault. Then the owner just came in as we were paying and was chatting with the table next to us. Hope he eventually was heading in the kitchen to check on things and get them up to par.

Hope it improves. A long time staple on the restaurant scene but will refrain from sending folks there for awhile."}
{"text":"Go for the view, go for the view, go for the view...

I can honestly say I would give this place a higher review if the food was better. The menu is Asian inspired and but the execution is a little pretentious. The service was not as good as you would expect for the prices of the restaurant. Perhaps it was because I went with my family and this place is geared towards a more 'adult' crowd, but nevertheless the service should be the same no matter what. 

The butter poach lobster tacos were nothing to write home about, neither was the duck fried rice. The papaya salad needed a little more kick to it, it is Asian after all... The best app that we got was the nachos, it's covered in local beer cheese and bacon. I would get them every time. 

Though the lobster mac and cheese had a bit of lobster, the actual cheese portion of the plate overpowered the lobster a little too much. I was also really looking forward to the NY Strip... but it needed salt... a steak... that needs salt at a restaurant... without salt at the table... smh. The bright spot of the dish (figurative and literally) were the Brussel sprouts. 

I go to Fahrenheit a lot for the view and drinks with friends, but I'm not sure I would shell out top dollar dinner here again. Overpriced drinks for the view I can handle, the food needs to catch up to the prime location of the establishment."}
{"text":"Third visit - and last.  My wife and I keep expecting this place to live up to the expectations and it doesn't. Have made reservations on all occasions and still end up waiting 5-10 minutes for our table; even when there are empty tables to be seen.  The food is pretty good but is very overpriced and bit salty.  The service is hit-or-miss.  The decor is not well kept.  I walked away from this experience regretful."}
{"text":"We went solely for the purpose of the rooftop bar. Drinks were very interesting and different! Atmosphere was very cool! Doors completely open so you get an indoor / outdoor vibe. They do have a few tables on the patio and some fire pits which I stood around for hours. We had a great time and we also had wonderful views of the city"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I spent 31 dollars for a non alcoholic drink and nachos (that tasted like greasy potato chips with cheddar cheese) they were not good & made my stomach hurt. Oh yea and I also paid for the parking. You're basically paying for the view when you come here."}
{"text":"Came here for a couples date night. If you are a couple and you have couple friends you go on dates with you must try this place out. The view is Instagram worthy, the food will soften the heart of the hardest food critic, and the service was good for that night.  It is a little pricy but when the food is as good as it is here, the price may not deter you from going. The drinks are very pricy and they have no excuse for that expect for maybe they have one of the best views in town. 
I had made reservations, so one thing that did bother me was that we were asked to wait for our entire party to arrive before we were seated, which I find a little inappropriate for such a high end place where there was plenty of room to seat us. BUT, maybe that's just policy. They would have made more money seating us though, but what do I know. 
I am raving about the food but the plate that I had was actually not that spectacular. I had the Maine Lobster Mac and Cheese. It wasn't the best I've had. I've actually had better out of a food truck for $20 less, but maybe my taste buds haven't acclimated to expensive tasting lobster mac and cheese. Maybe. However my two of my comrades ordered the Slow Braised American Wagyu Short Ribs. That is a plate I can stand behind. I would go back to eat here just for this plate alone. So there you have it."}
{"text":"I'm obviously not in the demographic that this restaurant is trying to reach (not young and hip with an endless expense account).  This place was recommended to us to try and it was exciting to expect a memorable dining experience with such a view of the city.  The view is incredible and after dark it is probably more so.  That was nearly the only positive of the experience.  I HIGHLY recommend the wedge salad as it is not made with your typical iceberg lettuce and the homemade blue cheese dressing was awesome.  That's where the positive ends.  My daughter and I split their Shrimp Pad Thai and while it was good, the noodles were scarce and overcooked.  And she found what appeared to be a piece of a toothpick in the dish.  While the server seemed concerned, she didn't really get overly excited about it and brushed it off as part of a brush used in the preparation (a wooden brush?).  She offered as a free dessert to make up for the error and served it without even asking if that would sooth our upset emotions.  It was some kind of chocolate cake with lots of goo on top which really wasn't edible.  There were three apparently homemade chocolates on the plate too which were good.  The food we got was way overpriced for what it entailed.  We won't be returning to Farenheit although I doubt we'll be missed."}
{"text":"The location and view were spectacular.  You get an outstanding view of the city.   The terrace is beautiful and a great place for drinks.  I was extremely disappointed in the food.  I ordered short ribs and they were the worst short ribs I have ever had. They were tough and chewy and so salty.  They were also fatty and I had trouble cutting them.  Which I was surprised I was going to have cut anyway since short ribs should be able to shred apart. They were served over noodles which were also way too salty.  I took two bites and could not eat the rest of my dinner.  The service was also way too slow. We were there for a group dinner--it took about an hour and a half to get our food.  Way too slow.  If you are going, go for the view and drinks, but skip the food."}
{"text":"But oh, about that view...

Imagine yourself, suspended amidst Charlotte's tallest buildings. Now, insert a cocktail,  some bites (no vampires allowed) and hopefully a few laughs and you're good money. 

I always love dropping by here whenever I'm in town. The view is just epic and no matter the time of day, I've always been able to find room to enjoy the view around the perimeter on the balcony, even when the restaurant and bar are pretty full. 

The outdoor fire pits are dazzling and elegant and service has always been stellar. The food that I've tried has been pretty decent too, but keep in mind the portions may be a little petite depending on what you choose to order. 

If you're looking for a skyline view and an opportunity to drink a cocktail with your pinky up without an overtly pretentious crowd, then Fahrenheit is a good look for you!"}
{"text":"Loved our Anniversary dinner at Fahrenheitt. We arrived a bit early; sat at the bar to kill time. It took a hot minute to get anyone's attention at the bar to order a drink and water, made us somewhat leery of what was to come, there was lots of standing around chitchatting. The red headed bar tender was the only one I saw hustling and seemed personable.
However, our waitress Cassidy made up of the somewhat lousy bar service. She was awesome and very personable! The lobster Mac and cheese was by far my favorite; my husband tried one of their pizzas and it was delicious! We really appreciate our wonderful valet service; shout out to Charles Haynes for making our experience wonderful and meeting our expectations! Thanks Fahrenheitt, we look forward coming back!"}
{"text":"Lobster Mac n Cheese was good. Kobe short ribs were awesome!

Decent Happy Hour specials and crowd on a Thursday"}
{"text":"Came for the CLE Seats event before Game 1 of the NBA Finals.

Fahrenheit was much larger than I anticipated. There was a room prepared for the event, staffed with two bartenders and an area for apps and napkins, which we all appreciated. I opted for the Moscow Mule which was good and on the strong side. I kept my buzz in check with delicious meatball and thin crust pizza. I didn't get to try the sliders, but everyone said they were great.

We really enjoyed lounging in the patio area on a beautiful June afternoon. 

We'll have to try their full menu when we're in town next."}
{"text":"Great place to go, but not on a first date.
All the menu items I was interested in had garlic or onion. I wanted to order steak but got the chicken to be polite. Beautiful presentation but didn't care for the dish.
The avocado appetizer was fabulous.
Amazing service.
I came back and ordered food to-go another night and tried their Brussels sprouts and highly recommend."}
{"text":"AWESOME spot. 
Tremont seriously impresses me more and more every time i go out. I came here with a couple gfs on saturday night. The place was packed so make resi's. 
Services was great, drinks were strong and the food was delish.

For an app- we got the spicy thai meatballs- YUM
I got the Dr. Bob martini which was great and then we split a bottle of wine.
For entrees: I got the short rib which was TO.DIE.FOR. This is what everyone suggested on yelp and the couple next to me were enjoying it so i couldn't resist. My friend got the Margarita pizza which was yummy and my other friend got the lobster mac n cheese which I would never get. She said it was okay and when I tasted it i was NOT a fan.

Overall it was a great night. I will def be back :)"}
{"text":"This is a great seafood restaurant. The staff was friendly and drinks were decent. The best part is the view. You can see the whole city from the rooftop, which makes for great pictures during the day or at night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a long layover in Charlotte and decided to go into the city for a bit. We had brunch at Fahrenheit. The view was incredible!! We had a table right next to the window and after eating we spent some time out on the patio, where there were a few tables and couches, just taking in the view. We probably spent about two hours there. The waiters were friendly and attentive. It happened to be my birthday and our waiter brought me a mini cake- such a nice surprise! The food was ok, it was decently good but not great. That is the reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5. But you don't really go here for the food, you go for the view."}
{"text":"PROS
-Entrees: Short ribs and pork shank. I've been to Fahrenheit many times over the years and have to say the short rib dish and pork shank dish are my two favorites. I've even ordered the pork shank via ubereats because it's just that good.
-Apps: Ahi tuna nachos. Was pleasantly surprised by this dish. The tuna was plentiful and meaty and the sauce was perfect with the rest of the dish. My only complaint is I wanted more!
-Happy Hour. They have an amazing happy hour here. They serve bacon like fries and offer special, amazing pizzas. Great for a post-work bite.

CONS
-Prime Steak Burger. I am not a picky eater and neither is my husband. However, I had a few bites of this and couldn't eat anymore. My husband also tried a bite and confirmed the bad taste. It was gross. It tasted earthy and mushroom-y. The gorgonzola overpowered some of this, but the bites that had no cheese were awful. Not sure if this is a standard item on their menu, but I would advise against it.
-Decor. I think it's been awhile since they've updated the interior and it's starting to feel a bit dated. 

BOTTOM LINE
-Come here and order anything but the burger!"}
{"text":"Amazing Atmosphere! Fantastic Food! Superb Service! Overall experience.....I was beyond impressed and I am a perfectionist! 

On Saturday evening, I hosted a surprise 40th birthday in the private room. Chef Rocco took the time to greet our guest and made the entire evening perfectly perfect! From the atmosphere to our personal bartender to the display of food the night could not have gone better."}
{"text":"This is a very cool laid back place with crazy good food!!!! Everything you eat will blow you away! Lobster bisque and short ribs OMG, impossible to not leave totally satisfied and in a better mood than you came in with!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, extremely upscale and exquisite cuisine. My wife and I had a reservation at 915 pm and we arrived at 830 pm. We took about 50 pixs outside with beautiful downtown Charlotte as our back drop.  Our waiter, Edward P, was extremely helpful and knowledgable with selecting drinks, appetizer, and entrees.  

Lastly, This place was jammed pack and a reservation  is highly encouraged; grown and sexy is the best attire"}

Amazing rock shrimp and nachos!  Amber and Jordan are amazing bartenders.

Love the decor and the crowd most nights!"}
{"text":"The soup special: cauliflower, coconut, miso - to die for! The scallops - incredible! The lobster Mac - extremely rich, but delicious.

Only a couple of minor flaws: they brought the bread out 2 minutes before our dinners were served, and the floor is very creaky. My water glass would slide around the table when people walked by. 

Other than that, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best Short Rib I've ever had. The lighting is a perfect romantic setting for a date night. Excellent drink menu and service. I've now been to Fahrenheit 5 times and I don't see an end in sight. Find a group of friends or your significant other and enjoy this place and the rest of Tremont."}
{"text":"We were hoping for jackpot. 
Roc saw the chef on The Today Show.

It was just a tv show. The expected chicken wings on the Today Show must have flown the coop.

The service was flying next to the chicken wings.
The dessert was the wingman. 

The chicken wings at Harold's are about the same 

The decor was great but unfortunately we do not eat that.

We will be stop there on our return trip!

We arrived in White Plains the next day!

Shalom"}
{"text":"Mainly for the great view and atmosphere. Drinks were great. Sangria was refreshing.  Sweet Georgia Peach drink was good. Appetizers were pricy and not on the top of the list. We ate the spring rolls and shrimp.

We just got appetizer and drinks, however noticed the Mediterranean pizza was large on another couples plate. Service was fine. 

Expensive however best view of uptown."}
{"text":"$10 up charge to substitute twice baked potato for the side that comes with the filet mignon. I'm sorry but I'm already paying a premium here and $10 for a potato is insane.  2 stars for now because of this. I ordered the skirt steak that comes with the twice baked potato instead of the filet. Will update this once I've eaten.

I'm going to keep the 2 star review because I probably won't eat here again. The view is great, service is ok (my server was clearly green but she was trying and with some experience she may be a great server). My skirt steak was OK, a bit tough and stringy, which is why I wanted a filet instead, but the flavor was good and the cooked temp was perfect. My jaw is just a bit tired from chewing so much and it was hard to cut so not a very pleasant experience. Potatoes and Brussels were great so my only complaint is that I paid $55 for a tough stringy steak because they were going to charge me $10 to substitute a potato with the filet mignon

{"text":"Very delish and the atmosphere is so sweet.. You can it outside or in.. The cuisines have a flavor in every bite. We will be back"}
{"text":"Dining at Fahrenheit is a very unique experience! The roof top view is outstanding & always makes for great skyline pix, but the food is why you'll come again & again. Every plate is a hit! The staff is super accommodating. Top notch evening every time!! 

When our party of 17 unexpectedly turned into 21, they made it work & made us all feel like it was the plan all along. Hats off to the Team! 

Can't wait for my next excuse to enjoy another great meal, great view, & great memories!!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed. Had high hopes after a few recommendations but I did not find anything too special about this restaurant. They tried to be creative on the dishes but overcomplicated them and did not taste good in my opinion. I may come back to see if there is anything else in the menu that is better but at this time I can only give 3 stars."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner here Saturday night. Server Montreal was quick, efficient and so incredibly nice. The lobster Mac and the scallops are amazing! The bartender also serve up son great cocktails! The ladies loved the cosmos as well as the dirty martini! Can't beat the view either!"}
{"text":"Great view of uptown! Food is good but not the best. Definitely a cocktail spot for the view. Check out their Jalapeño Martini!"}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with this restaurant I am completely obsessed with this part of Cleveland Ohio I had some major major major things happening to me and this little nook in my city that were life-changing and I hated those things happen to me there because it ruined how much I love that part of the city this restaurant is on real Yumma...try everything on the menu and when you're done trying everything on the menu happen all over that part of the city it's so young beautiful and alive."}
{"text":"Food was not good. Service was horrible, waited an hour for the check. For the price expect much better. Vanilla ice cream was above average. Will not come again ever. Two friends got showered in calamari from the unsteady hands of the server."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that definitely lives up to all the hype.  Started the meal off with their fresh, grainy bread with an herbed butter, as well as an olive spread.  The butter and the bread was o.m.g. delicious and had us asking for a second basket.  I had the short ribs since it seemed to be the most discussed meal item on Yelp.  It was not disappointing.  Fork tender meat with a wonderful Asian glaze over perfectly cooked and seasoned lo mean noodles.  Loved the flavor of the mushrooms in the dish.  The only thing I wasn't wild about is that it was a fairly salty dish, so expect to be pretty thirsty afterwards and the next day.  Good thing the service is excellent and my water glass and soda were never empty.  For dessert had the Thermostat coffee drink which was delicious, but by the time I got it the whipped cream was melted and it was a little sad looking.  However, it was quite tasty.  For dessert I split the apple crostada with a friend.  It was good, but not amazing, and we were jealous of another friend who had ordered the chocolate lava cake.  If I went back I'd try that.

My friends tried various entrees including the walleye, filet and lobster macaroni and cheese.  Everyone had nothing but good things to say about their meal.  When I go back, I'm definitely going to get the lobster mac and cheese.  I stole a bite of my friends and it was delightful.

The service was excellent.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu.  There was a little pushback when asked to substitute regular mashed potatoes for wasabi mashed potatoes, which I found odd, but they were willing to do it.  Our waitress was so great when it came to splitting the check with many of us there and splitting one person's bill among everyone's.

Long story short, I will definitely be back!  A great place for special occassions or out of town guests."}
{"text":"Excellent server even though he was only a week on the job, very good entrees with excellent flavor and large portions.  STRONGLY recommend that you ask for an UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW of uptown, especially if you're there for the first time.  It appeared that all of their 2-tops were blocked by very wide pillars, so we spent our romantic date and first time at this restaurant--which we attended specifically to enjoy their renowned view--staring at one of those lovely support pillars.  We would have asked to be reseated, but the restaurant was busy and probably wouldn't have wanted to place only 2 people at a table meant to seat 4 or more.  In general, will treat as a special occasion place for our of town guests, but won't go back as just the 2 of us."}
{"text":"I feel I didn't have the best experience while here initially I got the king crab salad which you really can't mess this up. The salad was not tasty at all and the greens were old so I said ok cool I choose the wrong item on the menu. Waited for the entrees for 1hr and 15 min just to get cold over cooked lamb and lobster Mac ended up leaving. Management offered a dessert like I would sit there another minute. I'm really disappointed thought this would be a great experience."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but that's to be expected at Fahrenheit. 

Started with some drinks.  Even with a completely full and happ'n bar, drinks came out to our table relatively quickly.  Some unique martini's on the menu ordered by my table.  Good presentation and taste, if that's your cup of tea....or in this case, vodka.

Don't skip over the appetizers on your way to entrees. The \"Crabby Clams\" were delish, as was the bowl of crab chowder.  

Kobe short ribs literally fell apart they were so succulent. Glaze on them was wonderful. Lobster mac and cheese was decadent, with big hunks of lobster. One in our party had the pork chop special, and I've never seen a bone picked so clean. Only complaint: I didn't have room for dessert. Next time I'm showing up earlier to enjoy the bar side before dinner.

Service was great.  Waitress was attentive, but not overly, and made an entree suggestion or two that were right on."}
{"text":"Went for a friends 50th bday dinner.  It was packed and very dark.  Felt like I needed a flashlight to see.  Very tight between tables. We did have a large party and were seated in a room that really for small personal parties.  There were 5 other tables of medium to large parties with same server for ALL those tables.  Food that was not ours kept coming to the table and then they would pick it up and take it to the correct table (gross) the back up servers seemed very confused.  Our server seemed less than thrilled to be working.  Most got an appetizer due to $$$.  Everyone liked what they got.  One person got a salad and was served 15 minutes after everyone else with no explanation. Bills came and because we had to valet park (which I do not mind and I feel the $10 is worth it) it was added to my bill. That's all good so you don't have to worry about who to pay to get your car. However, because we were a party over 6 the tip was added to the ticket.  All good I'm ok with that HOWEVER what I'm not ok with is my tip being calculated on the parking!!  One last note... with what I could see of the decor it was sad. Tables looked like they had been purchased from Walmart with the plastic table mats and very uncomfortable chairs.  In short I've experienced but won't be back."}
{"text":"Will never return here and do NOT recommend. On our first wedding anniversary we drove to Cleveland for the weekend and chose this place as our dinner on a recommendation. The power went out after we were seated and the restaurant filled with smoke and got extremely hot. After sweating and sticking it out hoping for it to get better we were moved outside and had some pretty bad service from there on out. None of this was the fault of the wait staff. However after a terrible ruined meal we were holding out for some kind of discount or freebie for our inconvenience and ruined meal. Nothing. Paid full price with no acknowledgement for our ruined meal. Terrible customer service and the worst way to spend our anniversary. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit's average 3-star rating is absolutely on par.  I agree with the 3-star rating because: the ambiance is a little on the underwhelming side (3 stars); the service is mediocre (3 stars); and the food is flavorful with big portions (4 stars).   Overall, I'm glad that we went once but wouldn't return or bring guests for the dining experience.  

Underwhelming ambiance.  Fahrenheit is located in a Hyatt Hotel, right below where their condos start.  One of its selling features is showcasing the downtown skyline; however, we live on the 41st floor in a high rise downtown and our daily views are much more stunning and breathtaking.  Although the restaurant makes an attempt to be hip and trendy, its already outdated contemporary furnishings fall flat.  The restaurant is intentionally dimly lit to highlight the skyline views but the lack of periphery ambient lighting errs on the side of overly dim.  

The night that we came, it was stormy and unseasonably cold; therefore, the patio wasn't really occupied.  Inside the restaurant was frigid cold, so uncomfortable that it really hampered our dining experience.  When we mentioned it to the waitstaff, they told us that there was nothing that could be done and if WE were cold, imagine how freezing THEY were since the air vents are directly over their work stations.  I get the concept of commiseration, truly, but I'm not getting paid to be there, I am a PAYING patron.  It doesn't make me feel any better that others are just as cold as I am; it actually makes me feel worse that the restaurant is aware of the condition but can't pull themselves together to alleviate the situation on behalf of their patrons.

Mediocre service.  The staff is as friendly, courteous and prompt as you would expect from a nicer establishment such as this.  Therefore, meeting the benchmark among your peers just says you're doing what is expected, which is exactly what you get here.  I would certainly say that the waitstaff leans on the side of facilitating quick turnover.  They hovered over us throughout our meal, darting for near-empty plates, making the meal feel unnecessarily rushed.  

However, one noteworthy point to mention is when our waitress told us about the \"mouth-watering lobster special, which was stuffed with fresh crabmeat and then buttery, sweet lobster cooked to perfection placed on top of the crab.\"  Well when you put it that way, of course we're in!  After the waitress piqued our appetites with the vivid description, she returned to inform us that they had sold out of the lobster special.  Really!?  NOW you find out its availability after your entire spiel, pushing the lobster special like its the culinary delight of the century?  It all turned out to be a big tease because ordering the Kobe beef short ribs felt like going home with the second hottest guy/girl -- you know there was something better within your grasp but you just couldn't get to it soon enough...

The drinks were delicious.  We had the Moscow mule and I asked the bartender to create a concoction with pineapple juice, grenadine, Sprite, and a raspberry or citrus vodka with Cointreau.  It came out superb and had just the right amount of alcohol not to drown out the sweetness.

Flavorful food in surprisingly large portions.  There is definitely something to be said when establishments serve courses in large portions, so kudos to Fahrenheit for this!  We had:
------------DELICIOUS (wouldn't miss this):
++  crispy rock shrimp.  The creamy honey glazed sauce had just the right hint of sriracha to make it the right balance of spicy and sweet.  The shrimp had the right proportion of crispiness from the breading to the succulence from the shrimp.
------------GOOD (tasty enough but I would try something else if I returned):
++  kale and brussel sprouts salad.  This salad was sprinkled with candied nuts, cheese and cranberries, and I asked them to add apples to it (the brussel sprouts salad on the menu had apples on it), served with a sweet vinaigrette.  It was delicious and served in a large enough portion that my boyfriend and I shared but could not finish.  
++  Kobe beef short rib steamed buns.  The Kobe beef short ribs are marinated in a sweet sauce and served with sriracha on the side.  When the buns arrived, the bottom was soggy, which really deterred from this course.  Also, the bun to beef ratio was pretty small so you had a lot more bun leftover.
++  Kobe short ribs.  The short ribs were tender and moist, marinated in a similar sweet sauce as the beef from the steamed buns, served over lo mein noodles.

We really wanted to like Fahrenheit, especially considering that making reservations is not as readily available as you would expect.  However, everything about the dining experience as a whole just left us feeling unimpressed.  Ultimately, there was nothing remarkable about the experience that would compel us to come back or even to bring out-of-town guests (see my review for WP24 in LA)."}
{"text":"The entrees were absolutely perfect. The filet, the kobe short ribs and noodles... all lived up to the hype. The only little goofy comment I would suggest is that we ordered the meatball app and it came with 5 meatballs... it needs to be 4 or 6. 5 is just an odd number and how do you split that last meatball??? If it weren't really goodit wouldn't have even caused a ruckus...

Bravo Fahrenheit"}
{"text":"For all the hype I had heard about this place prior to going I was expecting it to be amazing but I left thinking it was just OK. We had a reservation for 2 people at 9p on a Friday night. The restaurant was not too crowded. I was not a fan of how the tables were set up (at least the one we sat at) we were so far a part that I felt like I had to shout across the table to talk to him. (And I'm a loud person by nature so this is saying a lot) we ordered two appetizers, the calamari and the lamb sliders. It took about 45 minutes just for them to come out. Very good though. For dinner I had the filet and he had the short ribs. It took a long time for the meal to come out and when it did the waitress apologized and said that our appetizers were on the house. My Steak was very good but after having to wait so long, I wasn't hungry anymore. I took 1/2 of it home. The short ribs were WAYYY too salty. I was surprised because every review online said that was their most popular dish. 
All in all the food was good but I still don't understand the HYPE behind this place."}
{"text":"Pros: great appetizers!
Cons: diluted cocktails (especially sangria tasted like Robitussin)! Entree was ok. Lighting was so dim that we could barely read the menu or see our food. 
Verdict: not going back"}
{"text":"Ate here my first night in Cleveland, my husband and I both had the burger (one of the specials of the night) and it was delicious. Good fries too! Service was good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Wonderful waiter! 

He was very informative on the menu and very patient with us selecting a wine bottle. 

Con: Not a lot of sweet red wine options but we made it work. 

They're also in transitioning of a seasonal menu so no calamari was available :/

Other than that, the view was very nice and it wasn't that crowded for a Friday night.

Will visit again when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit may just be my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. No matter what you order here, you will receive a consistently amazing meal- and service, too! Their most popular dish may be the kobe beef short ribs, and it's REALLY hard to shy away from ordering this on repeat visits once you've had it. Although a tad on the salty side (but who doesn't love a little salt in their life?), extremely flavorful, and a really good meat to noodle ratio with roasted mushrooms and bok choy. SO SO good! On my last visit, I made myself try something new, and it was of course incredible, like anything else I've eaten here!

We started off with the spring rolls and glazed chicken wings, which were both really good. Instead of a salad, we opted for the warm green bean salad next. AMAZING! The toasted cashews added a nice crunch, and the Thai vinaigrette really made the dish. It was a pretty big portion and would be a great meal for a vegetarian. Then came the main course- I opted for the 18 hour pork shank, which was no mistake. It was huge (or maybe I was just filling up from everything else I ate up this point, including the warm bread), cooked to perfection, and let's talk about that polenta made with honey and mascarpone- you could've just given me a bowl of that stuff. While I would have liked a little more jus, this dish was absolutely delicious. For dessert (because why stop eating at this point), it was a hard decision between the banana and chocolate bread pudding and the peanut butter tart- such a hard decision, I had the server surprise me. That bread pudding was to die for- after sharing a few bites because I tried to be nice, I devoured the whole thing myself and didn't feel one bit shameful or sorry I did. 

If you want an incredible meal, Fahrenheit will deliver without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Let's just say the experience here is great but the food itself lacks a lot of flavor. The server was superb! Went with a party of 11 so we tried each other's dish and let's just say almost every dish was flavorless. Appetizers was a plus but I could not say the same for the entrees. Maybe the chef just had a bad day... They had a great cocktail list and beer selections."}
{"text":"If you want to experience excellent food and service - this is the place to be. Our server, Kelley, was awesome - if he would have fit into my suitcase, I would have stolen him away to DC. His service was just that great! Very honest opinions, super attentive to our large party, and kept us all in stitches. 

Now the food...omg...I think I died and went to foodie heaven! From the appetizers to the deserts, every dish that came to the table was delectable! I had the 18 hr Oho Pork Shank and the meat was so delicious, it just fell right off the bone. Amazing. In fact, from what I could tell, everyone in my party immensely enjoyed their meal. 

If you have room, make sure to try one of their coffee drinks...and if you have a friend handy, try pairing it with one of their desserts to split. I had the B52 and it was quite superb. 

I really could go on and on about this place, but it's just THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I can't give them more stars and it wasn't due to the food it was the service. The server was either new, not very experienced or both. It took over an hour after we received our appetizer to get our food and our server was never around. He spilled some of our wine on our table and plate while pouring it and he never replaced the plate or wiped up rhe table. While clearing our plates he was holding the water pitcher nad he tipped it so it was pouring on the floor but he didn't notice until we told him!! He barely batted an eyelash when he did. We had to ask for our check but he was no where to be found. Again, he was really having a hard time and waiting an hour for your food is unacceptable. 
The food was good, albeit salty. I might go back but def need to have another server."}
{"text":"We went to Sunday brunch. We enjoyed the views and the food was excellent. Our group ordered the BAE, Eat clean/train dirty and the Cap'N crunch pancakes. We were all happy with what we ordered. Overall, we thought it was a good brunch, but I'm not sure how often we would return because it seemed like the wait staff/front of the house just didn't quite have it together. For example, we had requested outdoor seating when making the reservation, but they tried to seat us inside. I could see why, the outdoor seating options were surprisingly limited and in one area even seemed a little yucky with weird pigeons floating around and a gravel pit instead of a patio. Then it took forever to get a Bloody Mary and we were finished with our meals by the time it came. I would say to give it a shot for brunch, mostly because it was good food. Hopefully the wait staff was just having an off day."}
{"text":"Beautiful rooftop & solid view of the Charlotte skyline!

Came here on Saturday night around 11 pm after noticing a lot of the other rooftop bars had lines out the door and around the building. The people here are really nice (bouncers/security). Parked outside of Hyatt Place was a Lamborghini so this must be the spot! Anyways, as soon as we reached the rooftop, we ordered 2 drinks - Mango Madness and I forget the other one. But, Mango Madness was a Mango flavored Moscow Mule and it was delicious! Drinks are a bit on the pricey end but aren't all rooftops?

One half of the rooftop was jam packed with people at tables and the other half (where the fire pit was) was SUPER empty. The downside of this side was that there was only 1 table and only 5 chairs. We quickly grabbed 2 chairs and placed them in front of the fire pit and were able to talk & enjoy the beautiful view. There was no one near us at first, but somehow people ended up near us after noticing how comfy & unbothered we were! Definitely recommend if you want to get away from the crowded places!"}
{"text":"Great view of the city and place seems pretty fancy. We had a nice corner table for a work dinner. Attire is collard shirt as most seemed like people entertaining for dinner. The appetizers we had was the calamari, potstickers, and the steamed pork buns. The potstickers had some bacon slabs on them which was pretty good. Calamari was ok, and the buns were definitely different. For dinner I went with the scallops and they were excellent. Nice big scallops and very tender. A couple martinis settled for a pretty good meal. Service was a tad slow, but they were pretty busy. Price is moderate to high. They have some menu options that are cheaper. Overall it was a good meal."}
{"text":"I went to Fahrenheit with some friends last night for a birthday dinner. We sat outside so we could see the view of the city. The service took a while because we were outside but it didn't take too long for our food to get there. I had the grilled avocado with goat cheese crostinis and it was delicious! Two of my friends got the Charlotte nachos and enjoyed them as well. The food and the atmosphere at the restaurant was great and it became more lively as the night went on. I give the restaurant 4 stars because while the food was good, it seemed pretty overpriced. Overall though I would recommend Fahrenheit!"}
{"text":"There are some mixed reviews, but I love this place. I'm about to show you how to make this experience magical if you're struggling with the price point: I always save money by splitting dishes with my husband or even better yet, if you order the Margarita pizza, which is delicious and huge, it will feed 3-4 people and it's only $16-$17! Split that and get some drinks while you enjoy one of the best views in Charlotte. It is an exquisite experience for half the cost. Take it from me- my boyfriend took me on one of our first dates here, and now we're married. I like to think their pizza had something to do with that. Impress your family or that smoking hot broad you like by taking them to this beautiful place and showing that you know how to create an amazing night without paying an arm and a leg. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because you're somewhat obligated to valet park your car. Despite that, the location is incredible and the food and drinks are great!"}
{"text":"First off, SCALLOPS.  WOW.  The best I've had in town, no exaggeration.  They are served with a cauliflower purée, arugula, and pomegranate seeds, and they are PERFECT.  PERFECTTTTTT.  Every time.  

Other picks:  fried goat cheese salad with dried cherry tapenade, pistachio brittle, and \"local pig vinaigrette\" and bacon-wrapped chorizo-stuffed dates with tomato aioli."}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance, 4 stars for food and drink, 3 stars for service. Obviously the main draw is the view which is pretty spectacular. My husband picked this place last night not knowing it was restaurant week but he'd been wanting to try it. I also will say upfront that I was in the restaurant industry for years, so I am probably pickier than most. We got there early intending to have a drink at the bar. We ended up having an appetizer as well, the tempura rock shrimp. Amazing! I could eat this all day long! One note to the bartenders, if a customer asks about what's in another customers drink or an ingredient maybe you should offer a drink instead of answering and immediately walking off. Around the time of our reservation we decided we better check the status because we weren't sure they were coming to get us from the bar (they knew where we were.) Not sure if it was good timing or a good decision but we were lead right to our table. Our server greeted us promptly and even got me a taste of the wine she thought I'd prefer. My husband decided to order off of the Queens Feast menu and I decided on just an entree since we had already had an appetizer. He opted for the pork chop and we were big fans of the char but it was over cooked and dry. I ate the Maine scallops which were really good but even better was the sweet potato grits underneath. I will be searching for a recipe for these grits for home! Hubs ordered the cheesecake and since I'm not a huge fan I ordered the candy bar dessert. It's probably in my top 10 of favorite desserts of all time! Bill was dropped off and we noticed gratuity had been added. Not sure if it was due to restaurant week or an all of the time occurrence. No big deal as we tip a minimum of 20% normally. One thing to keep an eye on though. You add your $10 valet charge to your bill. Our server added it and then the gratuity so she was getting tipped on the valet. We inquired as to whether she shares tips with them and she responded no and that she just hit the buttons in the wrong order. Quite possible but keep your eye on your bill if tip is included and you've valet parked. The ambiance, shrimp, and dessert pushed it to 4 stars. The staff, while courteous, seemed a bit aloof and robotic. We will go back but probably just for drinks, apps, and dessert when it's warm enough to really enjoy the view outside."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch and everything was delicious. I had the saki sangri as one of my drinks and it was perfect. They had a special that day of sweet potato waffles with apples on top and cinnamon whipped cream and they were amazing. Of course the view was breathtaking. Love this place. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"First let me say that the food was on point and great. Along with the view of course. After two hours of being at my table I have seen my waiter only two times , and I like to drink not a good thing. Umm my check has been on my table with the credit card ready for about 30 mins. The waiter can make or break the experience. All and all the timing and service made this a poor experience. I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic,  view was amazing and service was excellent. 

The tomahawk ribeye was great and the salmon was excellent. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You come here for the view, not the food."}
{"text":"First of all the food was just ok, considering how much it cost. I was there with a group of 6. The service was not terrible, but we were definitely waiting on out server to order, then for our drinks and then for our checks. The ironic thing was then that the server came over to us and said her manager had said the next reservation was here and she had to ask us to leave. We were not even done with our drinks. We were only there 2 hours at this point. I have honestly never heard of this happening at a restaurant. It was extremely rude and I do not recommend going here unless you like being asked to leave before you are even finished."}
{"text":"First time here and overall it was a good experience. The view is amazing, which overlooks downtown Charlotte. We went on a Friday night which we expected to be busy, which it was. A friend and I found seats at the bar and the bartenders were very accommodating. The service was good and the app we had was delicious. The tempura shrimp was had was outstanding, topped with a honey glaze and rice chips. EXCELLENT! The gentleman beside us ordered a bourbon oatmeal pie milkshake that we could not stop looking at because it looked so delicious. Next time I'm in the Charlotte area I will be back to Fahrenheit"}
{"text":"First off, the food here was amazing! The lobster Mac n cheese was outstanding and the chocolate cake was incredible. However, had a horrible experience with the server. He didn't greet us until ten minutes after sitting down (wasn't a busy night). Took forever to come back with the drinks. Had to ask three people for bread since we were so hungry from waiting. The waiter asked if we wanted pepper with our salad, said yes and he never returned or cared to check on us at all. Like I said food was terrific but I would never go back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an incredible view; overlooking the Charlotte skyline, or looking for unexceptional, yet expensive meal, then you're at the right spot.
Fahrenheit is one of the few ways to see Charlotte skyline in the most luxurious way. The magic comes alive as the last rays of the sun kiss the glimmering buildings of Charlotte. 
I went during Queen's Feast (aka Charlotte Restaurant Week) and for $35 I had the Wood Grilled Avocado, Grilled Filet and the Cookies and Cream Torte. I enjoyed my meal and I'm glad I knocked it during restaurant week. Typically they serve it at a higher price point, and I don't think it's worth it.

Pros: 
- Indoor & outdoor dining.
- Elegant fire pit all year round.
- great for dates/ group dining.

Cons:
- A tad expensive.
- Popular spot, specially after sunset, and service can slower then. 

Three and Half Yelps."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and all of the food was phenomenal. Some of the best salmon I have ever had. The lobster mac and cheese was also delicious. Cocktails are a little pricey but the food and view of the city are worth the trip."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for an early Sunday dinner at 4pm. They had just opened and the restaurant was empty. 

I can't remember the name of our waitress, but she was excellent. She provided good suggestions and was very attentive. When she overheard us talking about the difference between fresh and store-bought eggs, she gave us the number to the local source for eggs that the restaurant uses. She also took our pictures outside against the skyline when we asked her.

The food was expensive, but I thought it was delicious. For a rooftop restaurant, I would think expensive prices are to be expected. The view was amazing and I can see myself going back again sometime.

By the time we left the restaurant had filled up a little bit, with some people eating outside and at the bar."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar Saturday evening, the bar service was fair but the view is great!  We ordered appetizers and drinks, the good service was really fast and the stuffed dates, nachos and crab dip were pretty good. The bartenders and servers are not very friendly or attentive- none of them seemed to happy to be there. Which is a shame to mess with that view!"}
{"text":"It's all about the view. Atop a hotel, the restaurant offers a stunning view of the city, as well as a beautiful porch to stroll or sit. The food is best done as small plates. Something for everyone from meat to veggies. Service was good, friendly and attentive. Take the time to walk outside before or after your meal. Makes for a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Although on the steep end for drinks, it's a great atmosphere and would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a fantastic 2nd or 3rd date spot.  The views of Charlotte are breath taking, and the food is phenomenal.  Although I'm not too fond of the paid parking @ $10 (should be free), finding a spot a couple blocks down the street was no biggy.  Great experience over all."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend visiting friends and was excited to try Fahrenheit as I had only heard good things. When our party arrived at the restaurant Saturday night, the hostesses were extremely rude and dismissive of our group."}
{"text":"Not nearly good enough to be that pretentious. 

Not a very busy night, three bartenders and had to wait far too long not for a drink (at that point of the evening) but to pay for parking. 

Thought valet was complimentary but it is not. 

It's just not that good to be that snobby and that cheap at the same time. 

Great meals abound uptown - Bentleys, Capital Grill, Halcyon, etc. And so does great service and great management (not perfect but very good). Fahrenheit was (again) disappointing."}
{"text":"I heard some great things about this restaurant, so I went with a friend for his birthday celebration.  While the ambiance and the view were spectacular, this restaurant fell far below my expectations.

#1. Fahrenheit, your vegan menu is pathetic and sad.  Vegans eat more than salads you know, so step your game up there.

#2. I ordered from the vegan menu.  The first salad?  Full of pancetta.  They remade it and brought out a second one--cheese in it.  There was no communication between the server and the kitchen and I was THOROUGHLY disappointed.  The only bright spot was the lemongrass rice; I have to admit that was awesome.

I won't be returning because my overall experience just was not good."}
{"text":"I love their cocktails and the rooftop view. The service has been extremely slow both times I've visited. The food menu could improve. There aren't many options to choose."}
{"text":"I was there on a Thursday at around 4:30pm. I was one of the first customers, the bar tender was really nice and my drink was also very yummy. I stepped out into the outdoor patio, had its amazing view all to myself . If you want to go there for the view, go before it gets busy and you'll capture a great photo."}
{"text":"YESSSS, this happy hour. Fancy restaurants so regularly run crappy happy hours that scrimp on the good stuff, but with Fahreheit's happy hour Rocco Whalen's looking out for us po' folks. Their happy hour pizza (brie, parmesan, goat cheese, maple, & chives) is basically a super-fancy, delicious, slightly sweet cheese pizza as big as my face - bigger, actually - for just $8. 

Also on the happy hour menu? Truffled fries, a super-legit burger, shrimp tacos, upscale cheesesteak, &, of course, chicken wings, because this is the Midwest, after all. I also love the option for crisp veggies (peppers, celery, carrots) with a lemony Greek yogurt dip for just $4 to keep things at least a liiiittle healthy.

Now, what you really want to know about: the booze. They've got a red & a white wine, two kinds of rotating happy hour beers - good ones! - & my favorite, white & red sangria options. The red sangria is sweet & summery & tastes heavily of blackberries... which you'll find in the bottom of the glass when you finish. All booze options are $4, so you can get considerably tipsy on the cheap. They've also got a tequila cocktail option for $5. 

Great vibe, friendly staff, good prices for tasty happy hour food options. This is a nice spot for an easygoing date night, whether with your longtime love or that dude you're just meeting off Tinder. I've never been for a \"real\" meal, but with a happy hour this good, I'm looking forward to trying it out on a special occasion. And they're going to start serving brunch soon!"}
{"text":"Beautiful views. Service is horrendous. My silverware came dirty and then the waitress didn't surface for 20 minutes. No drinks served during the 20 minute wait. Same problem at the table next to mine. Bad news! Brussels sprout salad is tasteless. Overall. Yuck."}
{"text":"Been here twice already and last night was a big disappointment. You were basically paying for the view when you come here. And with the amount you're paying for your foods and drinks, something high end like this restaurant you would expect parking to be complimentary. NOPE.

The first time I was there, I was blown away by the nightlife city view. But that was pretty much it.  Nothing else was appealing. The foods I have to say, I didn't even want to finish it. It was so mediocre for the price range! 

Last night I was there for a dinner party and I know when accommodating a large group, it can get overwhelming. I came late (my fault) and never asked once had anyone took my orders. While the rest of the guests ate (which was so gross, some didn't even touch their meals), I sat and watch. Thanks a lot Fahrenheit for the customer service. I do feel bad there were so many commotion going on but one of the server was extremely rude to all the guests.  Yes, it was busy but there's no need for attitude.  To keep this short, foods was far from a 'top chef' ordeal. Everyone was disappointed.  Lobster Biqsue tasted like they brought it from Costco, diluted it and served it to the dinner party."}
{"text":"Go for the view, definitely not the food.
Food was below average for the price point- as was the service.  For all the potential given the views, it fails.
Go for a drink- then leave."}
{"text":"If you went on an evening stroll on the clouds, you would probably stumble upon this place, due to the beautiful fire pit they have.
This place is located on the top floor of a hotel, and my oh my is the view beautiful. 

We made reservations, because it was CRW, and I am thankful we did, the place was packed, so I took this in to consideration while waiting for my food. 

But there was hardly a wait for my entree and appetizer. Which was so-so for my entree, my fiance's entree, which was the steak option, was above parr. He kept raving about his appetizer the chicken wings, which I trust were good, my appetizer the chicken springrolls were spicy for my personal taste, and my entree of the chicken pasta was so-so.

I was disappointed in desert, we waited about 20 minutes for our desert, and it was a  bread and butter cake, which ended up being a stale muffin.

Overall, I do not feel like I would come back here again, I felt like there was nothing here that was overall exceptional, besides the view of the rooftop."}
{"text":"We finally went to Fahrenheit after years of hearing about it. The food was fair but nothing new or exciting and it did not live up to the hype. I ordered the 18 hour pork and my husband ordered the lobster pasta and neither of us felt like the got the flavors quite right. The service was not great - it was a busy Friday night and it took a good ten minutes before we were greeted and had an opportunity to place our drink order. We were also charged for an extra drink on the bill. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The view from this restaurant was as advertised. The food was even better. I had the special Veal Shank with a nice reduction sauce on stone ground grits. Spectacular! The wife had spare ribs with bok choi and noodles. She enjoyed that as well. The crowd seems to lend toward the more mature crowd but is energetic and lively. This is probably not the place to take a date for a more romantic quiet dining experience. Otherwise, I'd suggest it to anyone that would like good food, good service, and a great venue and view."}
{"text":"Kim's QATTPR (Quick And To The Point Review).

GREATNESS
Fahrenheit House Salad with Miso Dressing and Candied Cashews was splendid indeed.  These nuts were gigantic and tasty which made mmiissooo ******, me love you long time.  Homage to 2 Live Crew.

MIXED FEELINGS
See above and below.  However, I will make another appearance at this establishment - the service was fabulous, the atmosphere is oh so cozy and the chefs are lil studs muffins. 

BAD TO THE BONE
Tuna is the name of the game however, it was a series of fumbles here (insert cough and whispers Browns Sundays).  The tuna was not \"sushi grade\" as described on the bible book menu more like \"frozen dinner grade\" and Indonesian Stir-Fried Rice had enough green curry to kill a small Indonesian child.  Tomato & Cucumber Salad well yes that sounds great but where the h e double hockey stick was it on my plate?

SIDE NOTE
Gee whiz I'm not a rocket scientist but every freaking time I google mapped this sucker I failed miserably on its spelling.

peace, blessing, salad dressing

{"text":"Great view! Bring a jacket if you plan to sit outside, it's a bit windy! Not many beer options but plenty of cocktails."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best view in charlotte.
The menu was very small. I wish there was a better variety of foods. The fiancée does not like seafood so she had like 2 or 3 options for entrees. Either way the strip with the aged balsamic was amazing"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight on Valentine's Day, and was surprised that I enjoyed it after reading some of these reviews. We had the pork steamed buns as an appetizer and they were excellent. I had the scallops and my date had the ribeye. Both dishes were very good. Dessert was the salted caramel cheesecake, which was horrible. No flavor, except the overwhelming flavor of the crust. We had two cocktails which were great and a glass of iced wine for dessert. 

As everyone already stated, the view is beautiful and I love the fire that wraps around the restaurant. You can even see the flames from the inside.

I do think the menu is overpriced by about $10 a plate, the food is good but nothing spectacular. I would rather dine at other restaurants uptown for this price range. I would definitely go back for appetizers and drinks. I'm not sure I would eat dinner again, though. 

Overall it was a good experience. I would probably try this place at least once if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I'll be back for the view and a drink. Unfortunately, the entrees were average and the service was awful! A good place to go when you are looking for a fun time! But, definitely don't attend when you want to impress with good food and drinks, choose else where!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. Everything I've ever had here I love. I dream about the wasabi mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I've seen so many mixed reviews. Personally, I think the food and Service here has always been great. The view is impeccable! Some of my favorite dishes: 

The Calamari is a large portion, layered over fresh local greens tossed in a special sauce

Chorizo Stuffed Dates is wrapped in BACON!!! has a sweet flavor in each bite

Butter Poached Maine Lobster Rolls (you get 3) on a plate...each roll has lumps of lobster meat, Very tasty 

Heritage Farm Pork Fried rice is large enough to feed 2 people, Best Fried Rice Ever!!!!

The Pizza's are Large enough for 2-3people:
Mr. Fungi Pizza....First of all, I LOVE all white pizza!! Not a fan of Red Sauce. The Mr.Fungi is topped with roasted Mushrooms, garlic, caramelized onions and goat cheese.....freaking amazing...gotta try it!!!

Margherita Pizza is unlike any other! Fresh Basil, tomatoes, and Mozzarella 

Grilled Creekstone Farms Burger comes with BACON (excuse my excitement) Grand Cru Gruyere, tomato Jam... which is more of a puree, arugula on a House brioche....#foodporn.

**Update** 
Visited for brunch with a few friends. I ordered the fried chicken benedict, the chicken was crispy delish."}
{"text":"Drinks are waaay overpriced for what they are (cocktails $15). View is beautiful. This is a nice place to go for a drink/view. The fire pits outside are a nice addition for cooler nights."}
{"text":"Great place to take a date for a romantic dinner. Fantastic view. The food (steak) was really good and the service was good. If you only go to have a few drinks at the bar and enjoy the view it would be worth it. I took an Uber from Concord so that both my wife and I could have drinks. Perfect date. Certainly a bucket list location you should try."}
{"text":"Good spot for a special night out. A bit pricey for me to eat there once a week.

Fahrenheit House Salad with Miso dressing and candied cashews was fantastic.

My friend ordered the beef short ribs...talk about melt in your mouth and amazing flavor, it was one of the best things I have ever tasted!
I ordered the Lobster Mac n Cheese...you must really enjoy the taste of goat cheese to enjoy this. But it was creamy and came with HUGE pieces of lobster throughout. We also had the chocolate peanut butter martini and the chocolate mint martini, both of which were very well made."}
{"text":"I took my fiancé here for dinner last week and it definitely was a great choice. She loved it and I loved it. We got in earlier than our reservation which was nice and the service was prompt and polite. I asked for a surprise on my entree and ended up with the signature short rib. It was excellent. My fiancé had the salmon and enjoyed it thoroughly. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I had dinner there on Valentine's night.  I enjoyed everything about this restaurant.  The ambiance, service, food and the awesome view. I read mixed reviews on the service, but I had absolutely no problems with the service. Our server was pleasant, knowledgeable of the menu, and gave us more than enough attention.  I can't wait to go back, and I imagine, it's going to be one of my favorite places Uptown when it gets warm due to the skyline view and outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Had reservations but wasn't sat for an hour past the time of the reservation. Not a very welcoming staff/manager. The food was not great, especially for the price. Good view of the city"}
{"text":"Great service, and a happening place in tremont. We got seated right away with our reservation and decided to order the black truffle meatballs for an appetizer. Excellent. Tender and a light sauce served on top of a piece of ciabatta bread. We then ordered the crispy shrimp tossed in a scriacha honey sauce. Also very good lightly fried and not overly spicy. 
For our main meal, my husband ordered the short ribs on top of Asian lo mein, the meat was excellent but the noodles were overly salty. I ordered the burger, excellent. Perfectly cooked and topped with gruyere cheese and arugula. The fries that came on the side were also excellent and had a hint of truffle on them as well. 
For dessert we had the banana cream pie. Untraditional and a bit more runny then creamy, but great crust and taste. Our waitress was very attentive and gave great suggestions. I would recommend this place for more of a group then an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Were visiting from Los Angeles and went here for my birthday dinner. Had drinks at the bar and Laura was very sweet and friendly and made us a good cocktail. We then walked around outside and took photos of the beautiful view! 

Appetizers my husband ordered the nachos- wow! It could serve atleast 5-6 people. Which i think is wasteful :( i ordered the goat cheese salad and as we are enjoying it they already brought our main course literally without letting us take our time and enjoy our appetizers.  My husband had the 45 day steak and thought it was average and per our bartenders suggestion i had the scallops and lobster mash which was delicious. 
For dessert our server Clint brought us a brownie/cake with a candle- that is absolutely amazing!!
*i think they need to work on timing when bringing out food- i saw they put some appetizers out on the table next to us and the guests were not even there!"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars for the food and view, but the service wasn't great.  

Bartenders and servers were friendly & helpful...once you got their attention.  The staff congregates around the pillar at the center of the bar and are so busy chatting that at least 3 times we had to wave someone down that wasn't around the pillar just to get them to get the bartenders attention.

The Vietnamese Rolls were crispy with a good amount of spiced meat and the sweet/lightly spicy dipping sauce.  The Pork Belly Steamed buns were simple and good.  They had the Dr. Loosen Reisling for $35/bottle.  

The prices are high for what you are getting, especially when the service is so lackadaisical.  

The outside area is nice to walk around and see the city and the mountains in the background, but the sofa seating outside isn't facing the view, but rather into the glass doors. If they're open it might be nice otherwise you're just staring into smoked glass.  There are some fireglass pits out there, but again, no seating around them.  Ladies keep those legs together if you're sitting down out there."}
{"text":"Expect slow service (on any day or time of the week) if you're dining at the bar or sitting outside. The servers are pretty friendly for the most part but that doesn't make up for the waiting time. I'm yet to have a bad meal there however the poor service is reason enough to deter me to another restaurant. 

I suggest splitting the nachos between 2-4 people. They're phenomenal. As well as all their variations of fried rice."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped dates .... Not sure about rest of menu .... Bacon wrapped dates are pretty hypnotizing LOL"}
{"text":"We left angry and disappointed by the horrible customer service!  A shame, since we'd been very excited to try Fahrenheit after it had been recommended by several friends and the Yelp ratings seemed so positive. 

We arrived on Sunday night (8/31/14) for our reservation and were shown to a table right next to the kitchen. When we requested to move to a table by the windows or closer to the window to appreciate the view, we were treated extremely rudely and with an unnecessary amount of attitude by the hostess (Cassandra).  Although there were TWO open window tables and it was not crowded at all, Cassandra refused to seat us at those, saying that one was \"specifically reserved\" and the other was \"recommended for a birthday occassion\".  Um...not sure what that means, and in any event, our dinner was a birthday occasion too!  By this time TWO more tables had opened up by the windows and she still refused to sit us at one of them.  So really, FOUR open tables and not one of them is available?!  At this point, I asked, \"So no matter what other tables open up, you are only offering us [the one by the kitchen]?\" To which the response was \"yes\".  No attempt to try to accommodate our request or to even act like good customer service was a priority!  

To be fair, Alex, the other hostess, was nice, and even apologized for Cassandra's behavior.  It's usually not a good sign when one employee apologizes to customers for a colleague...  

We left and went to another uptown restaurant where we spent good money.  No view of the city is worth substandard customer service!  

(Note that I was really surprised by the rude, almost NYC-like attitude in NC.  Even the best restaurants in New York pride themselves on good customer service.  Luckily, this was the ONLY rude encounter I had when visiting North Carolina.)"}
{"text":"We had a large party for brunch Sunday morning. The food and service were amazing. I had the fried chicken benedict, chocolate croissant and a huge side of bacon. Everything was excellent and we will be back."}
{"text":"The staff are thieves and the food is below basic. I forgot my black fur vest. Left and came back 5 minutes later once I realized I forgot it and they can't find it. That's crazy to believe their staff while cleaning tables steal patron items. I expect full compensation that's crazy wild. Service ok. Pork chop very through and dry. Better food and service else where."}
{"text":"YES. Upscale extensive menu, dining in low light, great portions (you'll have leftovers) and wonderful veggie options (would recommend the vegetarian bolognese). Parking is always tough here, but you should be able to find street parking nearby!"}
{"text":"When: Sunday Brunch 1145a

Pros: Nice atmosphere and Beautiful views. Clean and hostess very nice and professional. Fried Chicken had good flavoring and lamb sausage was pretty good. Diced Potatoes were nicely cooked and flavored (best part of the meal) 

Cons: food was very subpar and for $84 for 4 people 2 adults and 2 children (7-14), I definitely expected better. The girls had the CPT crunch pancakes and the brioche French toast. The French toast came with some type of cream of wheat topping slopped on the French toast and the CPT crunch pancakes were entirely too huge with some CPT crunch cereal pieces topped on it. Why??? I myself had the chicken and waffles option, Waffles were okay and the chicken was a chicken leg and breast. Why you would put bone in chicken on top of waffles I do not know. Now I as the customer have to work extra to cut around the bone just to enjoy My meal. The loco moco was just that, loco. Ramen noodles cooked and shaped into a patty and Fried, lamb sausage in a patty form and egg cooked over medium. Crazy combo but needs some more thought. Everyone's bacon was nothing but fat and little cooked again for $84 I should not have to ask if our bacon can be cooked all the way. 

Suggestions: instead of bone in chicken try either chicken breast or tenders, fully cooked bacon, if waitress is serving a family with kids ask if the cream of wheat topping is okay and have two options for the pancakes small and large. Also, maybe use a pulled lamb option as oppose the patty and let the ramen noodles go or have another option like a potato pancake or even over their potatoes. 

I am not completely writing this restaurant off I believe their dinner menu might be a better suited for us, brunch just didn't go over so well."}
{"text":"We showed up to our 945 reservation at 935, weren't seated & told we could go wait at the bar to wait, we ordered a drink and instead of transferring our check, we were told to cash out our drinks and go to the host stand. Immediately after we went right there and our table was given away. We were told to wait again and then told we could sit outside which I was excited about because it is an awesome view!! We waited for another twenty min without anyone approaching us and had to flag someone down to give us menus. Waited another ten min. No waters, no apology. Also had no light at our table, asked if one could be provided since it was night and dark and every other table had one, but we were told no. Seriously? Waited for another 10-15 min with no one coming back to us. Just left without eating hungry and so disappointed. Yes the view is great but the service was not worth even sticking it out."}
{"text":"Its so sad that the food here is not better!! I have always lamented that a city that is so beautiful and temperate should have a ton of rooftops so I was excited that this opened.  I have tried it 3 different times and the food is very mediocre.  I would go for the drinks only, and enjoy the view.  Total missed opportunity."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for restaurant week. We had an early seating and the service was very quick. We had the chicken spring rolls and salad followed by the salmon and pork tenderloin. Everything was good but nothing was amazing. For a restaurant of this price range, I typically expect something to be amazing but that didn't happen. We also had cocktails--the spicy Charlotte and whiskey business. They were interesting but again not something I would go back for.

As far as the atmosphere --it seemed night club like. A lot of the decor looked kinda cheap and like it would look much better in dim lighting. Again this seemed weird for a high end restaurant. 

Overall, I think this place has a lot of potential but for right now I would just go back for the view. Maybe this place is better outside of restaurant week but in my opinion they should try to serve something that temps you to come back."}
{"text":"Okay, where to begin. Beautiful view overlooking the skyline, right in your face. You'll notice nearly everyone is taking a selfie or group photo at this place on the terrace. Has an upscale bar/club feel to it. Drink prices are reasonable compared to anywhere else Uptown, but the food is nothing to write home about. Draws many different people; there's nothing stereotypical about it. 3 stars for the view."}
{"text":"Beautiful view, but....
The husband & I had a little date night on Wednesday and decided to try Fahrenheit. We were surprised valet parking was not available and parked in a nearby lot for $10. The restaurant does not reserve tables yet several tables had \"reserved\" placards. We were sat 1 row away from the windows, with a wall blocking the window view. I asked to move to 1 of the 2 available 2-person tables with a view and the hostess promptly moved us. (Did I really have to ask?)  The menu is small, which isn't an issue, except they were out of what I wanted to order. I ended up getting beef Wellington dish that was so bad I had to send it back. Left a very ugly taste in my mouth. The manager had my replacement dish (crab cavatelli) in under 5 minutes. It was delicious!  Our wait staff was helpful and professional. The restaurant is VERY loud. It is pricey. With all the options up town we won't go again."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, my first experience at this place for a friend's birthday dinner was very disappointing.  I ended up ordering the cauliflower ($9) which was dressed up in oil, few capers & slithers of Parmesan cheese....definitely not work the $9 and tax and tip on top of that. I was told by the waiter the chef can make a vegetarian lo mein, however I wasn't going to pay $25 (I'm guessing that's how much it would have been) for noodles and veggies.  I'm all about paying money for delicious food (vegetarian) but just because a top chef is making the food doesn't mean its the best for everyone.  The girls at the table ordered salmon and scallops which they loved, so I would recommend it to the meat eaters out there, if they are willing to put out the cash. The view of the city was nice but that's about all for me.  And yes, the drink prices are also expensive and dessert menu is bleak.  I agree with another review about Fahrenheit being the hype of Charlotte but doesn't meet the expectations. One more thing, if you do valet parking you'll pay $7 for it.  I will not be returning to this place for dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"I come here for one major reason: The View! There is no better spot in Charlotte to take in the skyline and a drink. 

I do enjoy the food as well, but love the view more. During my last visit I had the ahi tuna served rare and it was very, very good. 

Would recommend any of the following for food- 

*Short ribs- if I didn't order tuna I would get this, it is delicious 
*Bacon covered dates- always order for appetizer and would highly recommend 
*Calamari 
*Nachos- the \"chips\" are actually medallion sliced potatoes

The wine list by glass is smaller but has some decent options. They were out of the Napa Valley cab we wanted but the manager recommended some alternatives. 

We usually go here for work dinners but I've been here on the weekends for a drink. I love taking visitors to Charlotte. The view is always a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"We took our trendy, out of town friends to Tremont over the holidays.  They enjoyed walking the neighborhood and visiting the galleries and shops. Going to Fahrenheit for dinner was the perfect ending, and perfect fit with its surroundings.  Truthfully, I don't even remember what we all had for dinner. All I remember was that the experience was unforgettable.  I will add, however, that we were lucky enough to be seated at the front window, giving us (2 ladies + 2 tall gentlemen) plenty of room. The service was perfect.  The food was wonderful."}
{"text":"We started with the short rib appetizer and the lamb sliders, they were my favorite part of the meal. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is a beautifully situated restaurant - on the 21st floor with gorgeous views of downtown Charlotte. The food, however, is inconsistent. 

Here is my take having sampled several dishes during a large work dinner yesterday: 

--- Must order - Ahi Poke Nachos, Crispy Tempura Rock Shrimp, Crispy Calamari. 
My favorite was the ahi poke - the tuna was melt-in-your-mouth fresh, the nachos nice and crispy. 

--- Good - Grilled Kurobuta Pork Chop, Kobe Beef Short Rib Steamed Buns. 
They'd made my pork-chop medium-rare, which was the right call. The rice they served with it was divine! 

--- Meh - Maine Diver Scallops, Chorizo stuffed dates. 
Wish the scallops were cooked a tad bit longer, the chorizo not as long. 

--- Don't bother - Charlotte Nachos, No.1 Contender Cocktail. 

Service was acceptable - they filled my water glass regularly (makes me happy), but tried to take my plate away often (makes me sad). 

Worth going to for the views, as long as you order selectively."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The short ribs are amazing!  They make it hard to try anything else!  We also love the stuffed date appetizer and grilled avocados.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This could have been my go to celebration spot. I wanted to like it so much I went twice, and neither experience was good.

The first time I went we made reservations, and we went about an hour early and checked in and grabbed a couple cocktails. At this point we told the hostess that we were happy to eat earlier if a table opened up. We enjoyed our cocktails on the patio and took some pictures of the wonderful city view. We went back a couple minutes before our reservation time to check the wait - and were met with \"uhhh a few more minutes.\" We sat front and center for another 20 minutes at which point we found and complained to a manager. To his credit he sent out a snack, and managed to get us a table with a view within 10 minutes of our complaint. We ordered the lobster rolls (just okay) and the manager sent a complimentary order of bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates (amazing). My halibut was just okay, boyfriends lobster Mac and cheese was amazing. 

We figured maybe they were working out the details the first time we went, we tried again for restaurant week. The spicy cocktail my boyfriend got was so spicy it was unpleasant to drink. We were seated 15 minutes after our reservation time. The menu we were provided was not what was advertised online. When I asked the waitress if they would honor the menu posted on restaurant week's website, she snootily informed me that the menu she gave us was the only option (let me mention here the menu was the same except online it showed a choice of app, choice of salad and entree. In the restaurant you could only choose app or salad, entree and single dessert option, so it shouldn't have been hard to accommodate the request to have an app and salad instead of dessert). When she brought our wine she didn't let us sample it first, and had a huge attitude about refilling the glasses. 

We had the spring rolls and goat cheese salad (neither was impressive), he had the pork and I had the salmon. Both were good, but not amazing. Neither of us even finished our dessert, it wasn't great.

Two stars since some of the food is amazing, but not all. Restaurant is not efficiently run, but a if you get a manager they will try to improve your experience. Overall I didn't think it was worth the money."}
{"text":"It had been ages since I went to Fahrenheit. The fact that I take any upscale restaurant for granted in Cleveland speaks highly of its consistent popularity. The place doesn't really have a menu that sings to me, but there's a reason it's been around for a long time as one of the anchors of Tremont. We started with really nice salads. Since it had been a long time, for entrees my husband and I stuck to the restaurant's wheelhouse. I got one of their creative pizzas -- a sweet/salty/savory pie featuring cauliflower, bacon, and honey. Really nice. My husband got the Kobe beef short rib, which is arguably what built this restaurant. Fatty, rich and perfectly crusted, this really is a special slab o' dead cow for a carnivore. Our waitress was quite busy but had that perfect balance between friendly and familiar. She helped make a good experience even better."}
{"text":"Not worth it... waiter was nice and attentive.
The only thing cooked properly was the filet... ordered lobster and it was disgusting... over cooked, not even the steak knife could cut it... what was even funnier was we were charged 120 for the lobster alone. What a joke. We paid in full because it wasn't about the money. But the fact they serve such caca and charge that is very sad on their end. Charge us whatever but make it make sense. Lobster that disgusting and rubber like means you might as well pay me to eat it.... Dogs wouldn't even touch it. That's saying something! 

DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is one of those few restaurants for me where the atmosphere and food are fancy/extravagant, and yet I can actually find things on the menu that I love.  Sometimes when I venture to such places the food is too fancy for me and I end up spending a lot of money on something I didn't even enjoy.  Not so at Fahrenheit.  At my last trip I got the butternut squash ravioli and it was different from what I'm used to but still delicious.  I would still have to agree with one of the previous reviewers though - it is a little darker than I'd prefer (difficult to see menu) and it was awfully loud, as we were sitting next to a large group of people that were being rather obnoxious."}
{"text":"The roof top bar is amazing. so I am a fan for that reason. DO NOT go on a saturday night. Lots of people taking pictures. gives a touristy feel. Also I am not a fan of paying 20 bucks for a glass of flat champagne. Pretty sure that bottle was left over from the day before. The chorizo stuffed dates are amazing. The brussel sprout salad is a good choice. The Slow Braised Kobe Beef Short Ribs is hands down the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the view gives it an extra star. I honestly think that is why people go. Don't get me wrong the food was descent but overpriced plus the service was mediocre. I ordered the tangerine dream drink. It was good and strong the blueberries added were really sweet :) but the drink is not sweet. We also order the tempura rock shrimp, we devoured those. I should have ordered a second one. Next thing we ordered was the pepperoni pizza. It is a thin crust pizza. Nothing too exciting about it. The view and balcony are amazing. We were there at sunset and got some beautiful shots of the city. That is what you pay for."}
{"text":"I have been very disappointed in this restaurant on multiple occasions now. Last night, we reserved a table on the patio outside for 8 people. The group was in good spirits after a lovely dinner at another establishment in Tremont. By the time we left Fahrenheit, we were all a little grumpy. We ordered 5 glasses of wine and 2 mixed drinks, and literally waited 30 minutes for them. There is no excuse for that, as the restaurant was not overly busy. 

This was my attempt at giving Fahrenheit a chance, as the previous experience was very similar. With so many great restaurants in Northeast Ohio, it's not worth the stuffy and slow vibe at this place. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The hostesses were pleasant enough.  I asked them to point me to the bar (for fun, because the bar is the first thing you see when you walk in) and they both pointed wordlessly.  I said thank you and took a seat. 

I could see the service printer from my seat and it was spitting out tickets at a good pace, so I decided to forgo a signature cocktail in favor of the quicker and easier vodka soda.  
TINY DETAIL #1 The lemon garnish was a whole wheel, no slit, dropped into the drink.  Purely for decoration, not to add flavor- unless you want to first reach into your drink and then get your fingers all full of lemon juice trying to squeeze it (which I did, I ain't skeered).

The bartender was new, and working hard.  She clearly knew what she was doing behind a bar but did not yet know the menu.  I asked if the elote was served on the cob and she had to ask someone else (it is).
I decided instead on the chorizo dates, but they were 86'd.  
TINY DETAIL #2 Offering something so delicious-looking on the page then failing to deliver on the plate is not good.  It's like a broken promise.  Restaurants run out of things sometimes.  I get that.  But when you have a dish on the menu that you can't serve, anyone who orders it gets disappointed.  Not the way to start off a nice dinner. 

I ordered the wood-smoked avocado and it was f***ing phenomenal.  I took the time to scoop it out and spread it on the grilled bread- messy but fun- and together with the creamy goat cheese my mouth was super happy.  The line cook put a single unsliced cherry tomato in the mix, daring me to stab it with my fork.  Recalcitrant as all cherry tomatoes are, it proved too much for my attempts so finally i picked it up with two fingers and submitted it to its fate.  The other, properly halved tomatoes amid the avocado yielded themselves to my fork with ease.

Nobody asked me whether I enjoyed the dish, though the answer was patent by looking at my clean plate.

I went to the restroom to wash my hands.  It was mostly clean but kind of an afterthought.  No decoration, no accoutrement.
TINY DETAIL #3  A scented candle and some fancy hand sanitizer go a long way toward making a visit to the can something special.  A washroom attendant would be over the top but, particularly in a venue like this where people frequently take dates for romantic dinners, an elegant container full of mouthwash on the vanity would be a pleasant and utile surprise.

I ventured outside.  The rooftop view of the city is astounding, of course, but looking over the gas fireplaces back into the restaurant is a view even more charming.  Only flames and the silhouettes of ladies and gentlemen are visible.  It's like watching an old movie.  If you go outside, be prepared to have people ask you to take their picture with the city in the backdrop.  I photographed a newly engaged couple and wished them well.  Neither one threw the other over the railing so I assume they'll live happily ever after.

Back at the bar, nightclub-ish music still playing, crowd still buzzing, I noticed a half-empty bottle of Louis XIII on the top shelf and next to it, a full bottle of something I couldn't identify.  I meant to ask the bartender but she was still cranking out service drinks.  I meant to ask the manager but he did NOT want to be seen.  He was busy, and his business was not with the guests.  Actually I'm only assuming he was the manager: he was wearing a suit and had an earpiece like a secret service agent.  I tried to get his attention twice, both times he rushed past like the kitchen might be on fire (that does happen).  Finally I just interrupted the nearest employee, and she said it was Hennessy but didn't know how old it was.  If I wanted to order a glass of it nobody seemed interested in selling it to me.

When the bartender had five seconds to take a deep breath, she told me it's not actually that busy.  The manager behaved more like a Vegas pit boss than a maitre d', and no other employees acknowledged my existence or asked me how my experience had been.  There wasn't anyone handling the guests.  Everyone seemed too busy.
TINY DETAIL #4 Someone needs to be focused on the guests' experience.

Overall, I think this place is getting by on its t*ts, as they say.  One of the best locations in the city and the food (what I had) was remarkable, but the service could use a little polishing.  If they want to keep their reputation as the classiest place in town they're going to have to pay attention to the TINY DETAILS.  

That's what separates good from great."}
{"text":"Expensive. Nachos that you would get in a place like a food truck were $16 for a pile of twisty chips with cheese drizzled over and bacon bits. Everything on the menu was so overpriced that our party of 4 had to order just appetizers and a salad. The Buratta Salad was average and tasted very plain, barely an lettuce or vegetables; not much of a salad.. The desserts were plain and overpriced as well.

Pros: good service, 3.5/5 view, good quail, good crabcakes"}
{"text":"Disaster. Slow and rude service. They were not busy or understaffed, just lazy. Took forever to even order. The only thing that saved this brunch was their Bloody Mary bar, which is on point. Seriously the best I've ever had. And the view is quite lovely as well. But.... everything else was a disaster."}
{"text":"I made a reservation indicating it was my wife's birthday and our anniversary and ask If they did anything special and they said yes. The server never at least acknowledge our day, which is probably because she was never told. 

The drinks were outrageous in price, and the food was average at best. My wife's halibut was dry, but had decent intentions with regard to ingredients. My filet was so small for the price, but was a tasty little guy. I did not see any chefs or sous working, which for the price point I expected a expert hand governing food quality. 
Our server was nice, but never remarked us with new silverware between courses, and our main course came out before we finished with our first course.
The staff all seemed a bit stressed or a bit gloomy in spirits. 

The noise level is off the charts, and should be addressed soon, or it will kill their long term success. I would not come back for dinner, but I would come back for the view and possible appetizers and drinks at bar."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my husband and I's favorite places to go to. And while the food is still good, they're service is extremely lacking. The last time we went we had reservations, and specified not a high top, what did we get? A high top. Right next to where the servers stand and the floor shakes terribly. The hostess was rude and didn't even care that we had asked for a regular table.  Then there's the waiter, which even a mediocre meal can be made better by a personable waiter, this guy made Napoleon Dynamite look good. \"Do you guys like want any appetizers or  **audiable sigh**\" my husband also watched his drink sit on the bar for a good 15 minutes before he finally brought it to him. Very disappointed and won't be back. Bummer!"}
{"text":"When this place opened the food was delicious but now it's subpar as well as the service. I have been here several times but this time I went during restaurant week .  I order the pork chop which was so hard I had to use full muscles to cut it when it should have been medium so they said they would redo it. The next one came out raw!!! So then they said do you want to try something else. They brought me salmon boxed up since everything took forever!!  I get home and opened the box and the fish is raw as well!!! I tried to have an open mind but it took us 15 minutes to get an initial waiter from the start. So pretty much $35 got me a small basic cheese cake and some roasted cauliflower .  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! 
Service was awesome.  All of the wait staff was very professional. They serve a loaf of bread and chive butter. Bread was served really warm.  Butter melted perfect. Ok. My wife and I both ordered the short ribs. Usually we order different but everyone said it is so good. It was really good!  Best I've ever had. Super tender and moist. They served the ribs over a bed of noodles and amazing mushrooms. So good!"}
{"text":"Really well done restaurant. Casual and upscale, very relaxing. Staff on point from entry to exit. Friendly, helpful and informed. Food well prepared and delicious. Great wine selection and drink menu. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"We went for brunch a few weeks ago and had a great time. The food was incredible and our server Kala was amazing! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The bartender was awesome! He was very nice and held a conversation with us every now and then. The drinks were a bit pricey for my taste, but I'm going to assume that they charge for the beautiful view of the city."}
{"text":"The food was definitely not good in comparison to the price. The noise was outrageous! My spouse and I could not even hear each other speak. The server was not attentive. We were continuously poured water from a bottle and then charged $1.00 per bottle although we were never asked if we wanted it. Pizza was not on the menu but when ordered we were told it was not available, we then saw two separate party tables receive trays full of pizza. Took home leftover Calamari when heated the pan had so much grease you would have thought I poured  2 oz of oil in it Yuck!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant situated on the 21st floor of the Skye Condos.  The location provides a nice view of downtown Charlotte.  A little pricey, though."}
{"text":"The view was awesome from the rooftop. 
We had a set menu since it was a group of 24. The food was delivered all at the same  time. The service was good. The food was very bland. 
We were not allowed to tell them how to cook our filet mignon. They said it only comes cooked MEDIUM on all the steaks for large groups. Ours was very chewy. Not much flavor. So disappointed. 
The salads were simple- just greens & 3 teeny tiny quarter pieces of sugared walnuts. Wow. Hubbys salad had croquette goat cheese on the side & that was really good. 
The desserts were a small little round cake that sucked. The other dessert was a cup of chocolate pudding type mousse with a chunk of hard popcorn inside. Everyone had pulled their popcorn out of the dessert b/c it tasted that bad.  The chocolate was good & creamy but that popcorn was awful."}
{"text":"Coffee and mustard crusted pork tenderloin -- I know it sounds odd, but it was surprisingly good! The coffee flavor was definitely there, but it wasn't overpowering. The maple mashed sweet potato that came with it was also good. For my drink, I had ordered the Pumpkin 75, which included pumpkin puree, gin, & champagne among other things. YUM.

Everything about my entree & drink reminds me of fall. I like seasonal options. :)

I also ordered the calamari (can't help it. i have to order it every time i see it!). Slightly salty, but good sauce!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Fahrenheit which was recommended to us. It was in a hotel up on the 21st floor. They do have valet parking which cost $10 with validation. We made a reservation and just had to wait about 5 minutes for our table to be cleaned. At that time we went out on the patio/balcony which had some seating and a great view of the city buildings. Sarah and Taylor were our servers and they were awesome and accommodating to all our needs because we moved tables to fit two more people. I did not find the menu too appealing, nothing out of the ordinary of our fancy restaurant , especially when they serve pizza pies. I ordered the porkchop and my boyfriend ordered the ribeye. Everything was good and prepared well. I also ordered a salad and some ice cream haha which I loved more than my actual meal. It was definitely expensive but that was already known. Definitely a $$$ restaurant."}
{"text":"I read and heard numerous things about this restaurant before giving it a shot finally. New restaurants are bound to have service issues. Everyone is just trying their best. So I decided to give this place a shot on Saturday. We squeezed in a 6:30 reservation and were all so excited to give this place a shot. The parking is a bit tricky and the building faces into the city (not the street) so even finding the building can prove a bit tricky. They have valet which is usually your best bet although I don't know if it is complementary or not. When we got in the building luckily we just followed someone to the right elevator. It is the far elevator and you go to the 21st floor. As soon as you step out the view is lovely. The bar is sunken into the floor and when the weather is warm they open all the doors and the guests spill onto the exterior patio. It's equipped with fire pits and comfy couches for the masses and I imagine during the warmer months this place will be packed. For an appetizer we had the calamari salad. So good. It had a little spice to it and the salad it comes with is delicious! 

Wine list was reasonably priced for the selection. For entrees I had the lobster Mac and cheese which I thought was a little over priced for what you get but all portions are of good sizes and I found service to be on par with other fine dining restaurants in the area. Kevin was knowledgable and friendly and enhanced the experience. I would like to give this bar a try again and maybe sit outside on the patio!"}
{"text":"I recently won a silent auction for a tapas dinner and wine tasting at Fahrenheit.  It was an awesome evening. We started with appetizers and cocktails on the terrace while we watched the sun set over Charlotte.  From there we were served the most amazing tapas menu which the chef created especially for us.  The food and the service were both top notch.  We also took a tour of the kitchen, which was spotless.  There were 16 of us at the dinner and we all agreed that Chef Rocco and his staff did an excellent job!"}
{"text":"Dined here on 2/13/17. Used the Valet parking at the hotel entrance ($10.00). We had a reservation, and waited about 15 minutes.The ambiance was nice (reminds me of a NYC restaurant) and the view is great. Service was slow, but friendly. The menu is rather small, but adequate. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. The spicy sauce made it tasty, but the dish was mostly breading. I ordered scallops with creamy cauliflower, and my husband ordered the pork chop. I've never had scallops so I can't really compare, but the chop was AMAZING! Overall it was pretty good, but I think if I come back it would be for cocktails."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Lobster Mac and cheese was the best. We had the short ribs, tuna nachos, avocado dish, and some kind of pepper dish. All was great. Had a good bottle of Fausto (Napa). The restaurant was nice (a little dark in there) but very nice! Bread and butter was awesome with a great olive tapenade. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The web site makes it look like the outdoor patio is lined with fire boxes. It's in fact just two small gas fired boxes. The view is great for sunset but the drinks are expensive, $10-$15 for normal size cocktails.  Our credit card was hacked that night and it was the only place we used it."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Had their three course for Restaurant week. In general the menu is pricy."}
{"text":"This place is very unique this place has an awesome atmosphere located on the rooftop of Hyatt Place hotel offering an awesome view of the city skyline but I feel as though the would benefit more by provide outside seating year round maybe putting some heaters outside in the winter. The service was awesome. The food was decent but they would also benefit a little more from offering more side items overall good experience thanks for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Everyone and their brother recommended Fahrenheit, so I chose that for my birthday dinner. It also did not disappoint. The food was perfect, the service was excellent. But even if both had sucked, the view of our beautiful city would have helped make up for it.

Graham ordered beer, I had a cocktail, the '2nd Ward', and it was made of Muddy Rivers Rum, fresh pineapple juice, Rotham and Winter Orchard Apricot, & Kassatly Chtaura Orgeat, and it was delicious. It wasn't overly strong or super sweet.

For an appetizer, we had the Ahi Tuna Wontons with pickled and candied Fresno peppers and peach. I loved this, Graham wasn't as impressed. He said his bites didn't have any flavor. I thought it was a wonderful combination of spicy and sweet; but it could have used a little more salt. He also picked his cilantro off and gave it to me, so I have no sympathy for him...

Some of the reviews for Fahrenheit complained about portion sizes, so I was a little concerned before we ordered. Portion sizes are always something I worry about. I don't want a meal so huge I feel miserable, but I want more than one scallop, two mushrooms and a piece of asparagus (*ahem* Savoy 1620 *ahem*). When our meals came out, my fears were laid to rest. Both of our dinners were good sized portions

For my main course, I had the salmon (of course). This was King Salmon, with wasabi mashed potatoes, blood orange saikyo miso and pickled cucumbers and carrots. This was AMAZING. The salmon was huge and perfectly cooked. The potatoes had just a hint of wasabi, but not enough to be overwhelming. I gave Graham a bite, and all the flavors together reminded him of a sushi roll.

Graham had one of their specials: the tempura scallops. This came with asparagus, fennel and a tomato aioli and was just as delicious as my salmon. I've never had fried scallops before, but they were wonderful. The scallops were huge & perfectly cooked, and the aioli was the perfect compliment.

This is an excellent place for a special dinner. The service was excellent, the food was amazing, and you can not beat the view."}
{"text":"I have been to Fahrenheit numerous times and recently just went for Brunch for the first time. Their dinners are fabulous and every part of it is delicious. If you are on a diet, you can get it in smaller portions and will accommodate any allergy.

The brunch was to die for. Although I wanted the Captain Crunch pancakes, I went with the Wild Mushroom Pizza with mozzarella and goat cheese and seriously was in heaven. Although it was big enough to share for two, I proudly polished off the entire thing. 

The reason that there is 4 stars instead of 5 is solely because of how dark it is in there. They keep the lights very low which is fine but it just is hard to read the menu, even for me! It also gets very loud, which I wouldn't have a problem with but for older folks, it makes is hard and frustrating to hear a conversation. 

All in all, I highly recommend this restaurant! Seriously, try anything on the menu and you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"Really nice place for a date, the food is really yummy I only had one thing though so I can't say anything about the rest of the food. They have all the top booze and a great big bar. The outdoor patio is very pretty amazing view of the city."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of friends for a birthday, we were last minute on the planning and the restaurant was fully booked but the bartenders made our night so special. The bartenders, Mike and Andrew saw our struggle with seats and they gave us our own little section at the bar, they were so engaging and professional, the drinks were perfect and the food was exceptional. I highly recommend dinner at the bar, best view, best service!"}
{"text":"The fella made reservations here for Valentine's Day, and I was excited to see it come up on \"Most Romantic Restaurant\" lists leading up.

Fahrenheit definitely has an upscale club vibe, so I don't recommend it for an intimate, romantic evening. They played electronic/club music and had neon lighting going on, which was a cool vibe but not as intimate as we thought it would be.

Drinks were fine, nothing to write home about. However, I was REALLY impressed with the food. I don't even really like potato chips, but the Charlotte \"nachos\" are a must order. It's a huge mountain of cheesy chips that is great for sharing. The fella and I also both raved over the chorizo-stuffed dates (wrapped in bacon!). Seriously divine. We also ordered the Mr. Fungi pizza, which was a really unique and delicious take on pizza, especially in a town inundated with too many pizza joints.

My biggest complaint was with the service. We checked in 45 minutes early and got a drink at the bar while we waited for our 8pm reservation. At 8:10, we finally had to go to the host stand and inquire. Magically, a table appeared right away! The host staff were not very friendly and overall it was a slower service experience."}
{"text":"I just had my daughter's Sweet 16 here and it was a fabulous night! Lynn the GM was amazing, along with her entire staff. She took care of everything and made sure I was taken care of every step of the way. The ambiance was incredible with the outdoor fire pits  and terrace. Great venue for a party of any kind! Thank you Lynn!!!!"}
{"text":"Have always wanted to try Chef Rocco Whalen's food. Last night, I visited there at around 11 pm. I called ahead to ensure that they served food until 1 am. 

Upon arriving, the hostess informed me that there was open seating at the bar and outside. I poked around outside and admired the fantastic view, but there didn't seem to be any servers. I went inside to the bar to ask about dinner service outside, and the bartender assured me that a server outside would take my order. Yeah, right.

 I shared a long, wooden picnic table with a couple who were finishing up their drinks. Very obviously and conspicuously, I read not one but two magazines. Yet, no service. No drinks, no nothing. 

The couple left, and as I finished up my second magazine, a female server meandered over to me and asked what she could bring me. I asked, \"Are you still serving food?\" She replied, \"We serve food until 1 am.\" Then, she just stood there and looked at me. I asked, \"Can I see a menu?\" She replied, \"Sure. Let me get you a menu.\" Then, she wandered off.

 Having sat there for about thirty minutes with not even a drink, I became annoyed at this nonsense. As the waitress sauntered back over to me, with a menu in hand, I shook my head and told her I had been sitting there for thirty minutes without any service, and I just had to leave. Her reply: \"Oh, ok.\"

I've really been wanting to try Chef Rocco Whalen's food, but the place is a disaster. What good is the great view of Charlotte? For anyone who wants to see it, here's my tip: order a single drink from the bar and close out your bill immediately. Then, walk outside, stand at the railing, look at the view, and then go someplace else to eat. That's what I'll do from now on when I want to show someone Charlotte's impressive skyline. And, if this means I never get to taste Chef Rocco Whalen's food, then to quote his server: \"Oh, ok.\""}
{"text":"Great atmosphere beautiful view.  Must stop in if you are going to be in uptown, you won't regret it.   Would of gave 5 stars but they took my hot wings off the menu :(( #bringbackthewings"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Fahrenheit is great it definitely complements the overall dining experience.  The bar is small but nice and the dining room(s) are comfortable with nice seating and tables.  It is surprisingly loud when crowded but that really doesn't bother me.   The servers I have had have all been nice, timely and informative.

The food is fantastic, unique and beautifully presented.   The chorizo stuffed dates are a must have appetizer they are so good I could literally eat them every day.  The Kobe beef short ribs are awesome during my most recent visit here my date described them as \"the best thing she has ever ate, ever\".  The coffee and mustard crusted pork is also definitely worth a try.  The only meal I was ever disappointed with here was the seared rare tuna it was still good but I've had much better tuna entrees elsewhere.  The desserts I have tried were good but nothing really notable.

My only real gripe is a minor one, the past two times I have made a reservation here I still had to wait 30-45min for a table.  I'm pretty patient so it didn't bug me too much to sit at the bar and drink while I waited for a bit but to others this may be annoying.

I could easily rate Fahrenheit as one of the top 10 restaurants in the Cleveland area and would recommend everyone to at least try them out once."}
{"text":"Came for brunch during the holidays. Haven't been for dinner in several years, but this was the first time I checked out the brunch. There were 4 of us and a significantly busy rush and they only had one waitress on the floor so because of this we waited a little long for our first drink order. Once the place cleared out our waitress was fantastic. The food, not so overwhelming. I had the lobster Mac and cheese which was good, just very heavy, but that's to be expected. My fiancé however got an omelet that was over cooked. Our friends didn't seem to mind their meals, with the exception of how much a simple side of bacon costs. I would return for dinner but probably not brunch."}
{"text":"We had heard mixed reviews and decided to experience it for ourselves during restaurant week.  Upon arriving, we were told that they lost our reservation and we would have to wait.  But to the hostesses credit, she didn't make us wait long and apologized several times...forgiven!  While we were at the bar waiting, we did get to take in the great views of the city.  
Once seated at our table, we quickly realized that we had to speak quite loudly in order to hear each other, and we could hear the surrounding conversations very well (as if we were at their tables).  We ordered the calamari and a vegetable plate for our first course.  The veggies were tasty and the calamari was average at best.  Shortly after our 1st course came out, our 2nd course arrived.  To the waiters credit, he asked if we would like to wait until we were finished with our first course...we did...he forgot to bring it back out later and we had to re-order.  We ordered the Hanger Steak & the Salmon.  Both were good but not great.  The best part of my hanger steak was the potato & horseradish puree.  The salted caramel cheesecake was very good (and I rarely eat sweets).  
The bottom line is that we were glad that we decided to try this place during restaurant week because the $30 is the most the meal was worth.  We will probably come back and have drinks on the patio to enjoy the view.  If I would have paid full price, this would have been a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Found this place by surprise and I really loved everything about it. Me and my wife didn't have reservation on a Saturday night and the manager gladly made accommodations for us, the atmosphere was great and the decoration was very elegant. We both ordered fish entrees and well executed. As far as drinks, I decided to stick with beer but my wife got a rum drink ($12) that to be honest was short of my expectations. I will definitely going back...."}
{"text":"Lots of hype with little delivery. First off our waiter was nothing close to what you should see at a high end restaurant like this. Inattentive and hard to get a hold of. Food was priced decently however it really wasn't anything all that special. Salmon wasn't extremely flavorful. Cool scenery though!"}
{"text":"Wow what a view. The food was very interesting and not all was perfect but 5/6 is pretty good in my book. They have no dress code which I think they need. The service was very very good. Andrea & Chris were amazing. I am hard to please but I really say if you have not tried this place you need to check it out soon."}
{"text":"Two was for food alone. This place is a rip off. Literally the worst service I've experienced in a restraunt of this supposed caliber. It took as long for me to receive my drink as the food. Would never recommend this place. Save your money go to Sullivans"}
{"text":"Decided to try Fahrenheit in Tremont after I discovered the CLEseats app. There is a promo code for a free Margherita pizza when you buy 2 drinks. We enjoyed the pizza on the outside patio. It was great. I will definitely come back to enjoy there amazing menu. The restaurant was amazing. Great date night venue."}
{"text":"The service is some of the slowest in Charlotte. Anybody that writes anything different came before 5 pm. The bartenders are spoiled with the amount they make per drink and just don't work very hard."}
{"text":"I read so many good reviews of this place that I decided to give it a try. Disclaimer: I went during Restaurant Week and this might have an impact overall.

The place was packed with several large groups in the bar, and several tables with 6+. But despite that we were immediately sitted. 

First yellow flag came when the server assigned to us was changed, for whatever reason, and we had to listen to the spiel all over again. 

Then after ordering drinks and food, we received our second entree in 5 minutes - BEFORE the appetizers were even delivered. They went back to the kitchen and we got our appetizers.

At this point, they earned 2 stars, one for the martini which was out of this world of so good, and for the appetizers, delicious (egg rolls and grilled avocado).

We were not even done with the apps when we got again our entrees. As I suspect, the food was lukewarm. The lobster mac and cheese I could probably do bigger and better at home. The short ribs were on the dry side and a bit tougher than expected. 

The whole meal was so very rushed, we even got our desserts without spoons and we had to stare at it for a few minutes before we got silverware to eat. We had toffee cake which was crunchier than I like. Also on the small side.

The coup-de-grace was the weather, clouds rolled in and we could not even enjoy the view as we could not see anything clear 100 yards on... I know this is not the restaurant's fault, but it damped our night.

Unfortunately the place is too expensive to try again and have another negative experience. Restaurant Week is meant to showcase a place to incentivize people to return for the full menu, but based on what we saw, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Fahrenheit was shortly after they opened.  Our meals were pretty good, but the food came out so fast-way before we had finished our appetizers.  One of my biggest pet peeves at a restaurant is being rushed through my meal, especially when it's expensive.  I really enjoyed the chorizo stuffed dates and my tuna entrée was delicious but humongous.  When I came back a second time with a couple who had never been, my expectations were fairly low. Let's just say my expectations were met.  I ordered the tuna entrée again and it was significantly different-almost inedible. It was so coated in spice that I had to scrape it off just to eat part of it. It had no flavor other than HOT and I hated wasting such an expensive dish, but I had no choice. The drinks were weak. My friend had to order an extra shot of tequila for her margarita on the rocks. No thank you. When we got the bill, we found out that our husbands' Jameson on the rocks were $21 per glass. At most other restaurants, Jameson on the rocks is about $12.  A huge waste of money. I have no idea how this restaurant has good reviews. It's overrated and serves mediocre food at best."}
{"text":"Hands down a must visit when in Charlotte! The view is incredible. I had a chance to sit both at the bar and in the dining room and was amazed as the night went on. My bartender by the name of john (I didn't get his last name) was very helpful on suggesting a drink and gave me the history behind the restaurant. Then came dinner, the food is fancy and delicious. From our stuffed date appetizer to our short rib dinner we were beyond impressed. We went for my gf's birthday and we received a decorated plate with  happy birthday written on it and a warm fudge brownie. We will be back for Valentine's Day!"}
{"text":"First off I can start by saying loved the view of Charlotte at this restaurant & bar!! We ate in the section where it is first come first serve. For the dining area you have to have a reservation in order to sit and eat, no exceptions. We ordered the nachos ($14) and steam buns ($14). The nachos were very filling but good, basically chips with cheese, green onion, and bacon loaded on top. The sticky buns were good too, they had a type of brisket inside with veggies. One of them was a little soggy the bottom. We were celebrating my sister's birthday and our waiter, Hannah, brought her a birthday surprise, a ice cream sundae. Very nice of her. They do have plenty of TVs to watch any sports game on. Will definitely come back for the views."}
{"text":"Beautiful view, great food, delicious drinks, and AWESOME SERVICE! My husband and I went to celebrate our anniversary and couldn't have been happier about our experience. From the hostess to the bartenders to our server (especially our server, Nick) everyone was great- best service we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Service could have been better but I wasn't expecting much as the whole dining room was booked. The food was excellent, which makes up for the service. I had the beef tenderloin and it was flavorful, delicious, and was as ordered (cooked medium). The green beans were warm and and filled with flavor from the sauce on the beef tenderloin."}
{"text":"The views are wonderful and the food is good but it's very pricey for what it is. I'd give it a 3.5 if that was an option. Our food took forever but management took off our appetizers.  Service wasn't overly attentive or friendly . It was super convenient if you are staying in the Hyatt Place hotel so I will def try it again and hopefully be able to leave a higher review."}
{"text":"I went there for labor day weekend, and let me say the view is outstanding, it's perfect for a date or group dinning. The service was great very helpful on what to order, I ordered the lamb sliders and for the entree the salmon with wasabi mash potatoes it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Visited last night.  Pretty good vibe here and great date night spot! The food and wine were awesome. The rooftop area was nice, but just fyi it's first come for the space.  Having seen previous reviews I assumed there was patio seating for dinner - but the patio is more if a chill spot for before or after your dinner. The only part of the night that was a downer was the disorganization   at the hostess station. We arrived 30 mins early and it took them 5 mins just to enter that we had arrived.  There were many empty tables and we were told just a few minutes we would be seated. We went to the bar and after laughing and talking we realized an hour had gone by. Instead of getting upset we just ordered dinner at the bar...15 mins later we got a txt saying our table was ready. After dinner we told them about our disappointment and their repose was \" we forgot, sorry\". But we enjoyed ourselves just the same and would give them another try."}
{"text":"I give this place three stars because of the view.  I would recommend coming here at least once to experience the view.  I went here the the day after my bachelorette party before all of my out of town friends left.  We all loved the view and it was great for photos and to look over Charlotte.  The food selection for brunch was pretty good.  Everyone found something that they would enjoy.  Before coming here I had heard that the food wasn't the best, so I didn't have too high of expectations.  We were all given our food, except me. So all of my friends waited because our waiter said it's about to come out.  I told all of my friends to go ahead and eat so that their food wouldn't get cold.  Ten minutes go by and my waiter asks me what I had ordered again.  Ten minutes after that she offers me a free drink, and 15 minutes after that I get my food.  All of my friends had already had their plates taken away before I got my food.  I ended up having to get my food to go because my friends had to start heading to the airport.  The food wasn't the best but it was edible.  My fried egg was extremely salty and the breakfast sausage tasted more like a hot dog, but it was so spicy that I couldn't eat it (and I put jalapeños on my pizza).  I'll probably go back, but it would just be to get a drink or something."}
{"text":"I am a huge panthers fan. We lost tonight 30-7. This wasn't the worst part of my night. Food was terrible. Service was terrible. Drinks were below average. Save your money and try something else."}
{"text":"The reviews in this place had me worried.  Due to the cold weather and being in town on business and having work to do tonight.  I figured I would avail myself of the restaurant in the same building as the hotel I am staying.  

Though this place is a bit pricey and the reviews were not impressive, I found it to be a decent place.   The servers are great.  The noise in the dining room is a bit excessive for my taste, glad I'm here by myself as a conversation would be impossible.  

They have some great gluten free options and even have a separate GF menu.  I had the chorizo stuffed bacon wrapped dates for an app and the steak with potato pave for my main.  Food was good."}
{"text":"Was very pleasantly surprised with this place. Had only eaten it during taste of tremont before and the nachos are awessoommeee.  Came this time for happy hour which is a great deal! Is until 7 during the week. Drink cocktail that day was the tequila blood orange, well made and strong (unusual for a HH cocktail when they usually skimp you). 
Shrimp tacos and wings were delicious. 
Also ordered the crispy vegetables which sounded awesome....but we soon realized they are literally crispy raw vegetables. The title was was accurate tho..they were quite crisp! (Would advise West Side Market next time tho). 

Will def be back for both HH (its a big menu!) And their regular menu(the seafood sounds delicious!)"}
{"text":"Been to Fahernheit goodness knows how many dozens of times and finally getting off my butt and leaving a review. 

It's awesome. 

You're welcome. 

OK, OK, I'll add more although you really don't need more, honestly. We've done their happy hours the last few times, and if we can thank Wall Street for anything it's that they nearly brought the global financial system to its knees. Wut? Well, see, if NOT for that we wouldn't have all these awesome Happy Hour deals at so many great places. And, Fahernheit's is right up there. 

Tonight I enjoyed the best chicken wings I've ever had.  Perfectly crisp on the outside while moist and tender on the inside and coated with some miracle something or other that I could care less what it was as long as Rocco Whalen never ever ever EVER stops making them.  Wifey had a great salad and we shared their fries, which I would put right up with Bar Cento's, and that's damn good. 

Service is always excellent (thanks, Tim), great ambiance, tremendous food, etc. etc. etc. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Give this place a little time, and it's going to rock.  Came here for their soft opening on Friday night for residents and such.  Overall 4 stars, but Miss Cleo said to go ahead and give this place 5 stars right now.  (Also, the posted food photo sampling is courtesy of a friend).

Our posse had plenty of critique and feedback concerning the execution of the dishes, but let's face it, it looked like everyone finished the mac and cheese, the steak, the ahi tuna, the lamb loins, and the short ribs regardless.  Can you really take our criticism seriously if we've essentially licked our plates clean?  I couldn't criticize much:  I love the seared ahi tuna plate, we may go down to city hall and register to marry.

All of the salads were innovative and I can def see a few becoming my staples here.  I'm no kale man, but I could be.  It's been a couple of days since trying the beet salad, but I'm going through withdrawal issues.  

For those clamoring for a restaurant with a beautiful view of Charlotte's Uptown, look no further... this spot has the best view of Charlotte.   Fahrenheit is hot, and it's only the beginning.

dmo out."}
{"text":"I hate giving this beautiful bar/restaurant only three stars but the service is way below par.  Did not even receive a smile at the bar.  Went on a Thursday night and the bar wasn't that crowded.  Took forever for someone to make eye contact with me ... let alone receive service.  Bartenders were not friendly or hospitable.  This bar could easily receive 5 stars with better service.  The drinks were good ... the food looked amazing ... and the views are phenomenal.  Service needs to improve for me to come back and to suggest this place to others."}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars and I'm doing that because of the view. I heard so many great things about this place and then I tried it. Mediocrely overpriced food. Just.. not good. For the price they charge I would have expected so much better..

But! Back to the view. Stunning outside view of Uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Six girls enjoyed a much-anticipated Saturday night dinner here in late January. Our server was Patrick and he went beyond for our table. Split a salad? No problem? Only want an appetizer and dessert? No problem.  Our group had varied interests but we ordered a margharita pizza which we ended up taking home, crab cakes, a Tuscan kale salad (which was amazing), two of our group had the walleye and really sang its praises. Another had the tuna and said it was perfectly rare.  

We would have bought a bottle of wine (or maybe two) but the wines were pricey and it was easier and more cost efficient and satisfied everyone's palate to have wines by the glass. 

Everyone talks about how great this place is in Cleveland. It did live up to its name, even on a busy Saturday.  And IT WAS PACKED.  

The real moment when we were blown away was with dessert. We ordered three for the table:  the Eclairs topped with chocolate and bacon; the chocolate pretzel torte; the chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  The eclairs were dry, did not have enough custard inside and the bacon did not make an impact. The chocolate pretzel torte was an amazing amalgam of flavors and the sweet/salty combination was delightful.  We fought over the chocolate lava cake, so we are two out of three there. 

Thoroughly enjoyed this new Cleveland sensation."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Glasses stayed empty all night, very impatient waiter, and food is not worth the price!!!! Very disappointed after wanting to try this place. THUMBS DOWN!!"}
{"text":"I heard mixed reviews about Charlotte from both Yelp members and word of mouth in Charlotte but I must say I had a fantastic experience.  I enjoyed a nice drink on the terrace before being seated and the view was wonderful. Once seated, Kala, our server was so personable, knowledgable and brought a passion to her explanation of the menu. I had friends visiting and she brought out hush puppies for us to \"guess\" what they were. While writing this it may sound corny but it was a nice touch to our dining experience and impressed my guests. My only downgrade was the wine list which did not offer a lot of choices in my opinion. I ordered the King Salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes, blood orange saikyo miso and pickled cucumbers and carrots. The dish was just what I was looking for, filled with flavor and cooked perfectly.  My guesses had the North Carolina Pad Thai and Ahi Tuna entrees and were impressed as well. I came in to this skeptical but all in all, it was a great experience with the BEST service I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Great place in Ohio City. A little bit hard to park, because it's located in sleeping neighborhood. Great service"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! This was my first time going and it was Restaurant Week..the steak with mushrooms and baby brussel sprouts was delicious. The Asian sticky wings and kale salad was awesome too. Our server Sean was awesome! He looks just like Hines Ward!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a Cleveland favorite for me! I have tons of good things to say about Fahrenheit! 

My boyfriend says if you asked him where to get the best meal in Cleveland, he would send you to Fahrenheit for the Kobe beef short ribs. I couldn't agree more
They are out of this world! The most tender meat I've ever had! This is a must try. 

Other must try's on the menu is the calamari and the Rocco's nachos, they are addicting. Seriously, anytime I'm at a festival or concert where the Fahrenheit food truck is, I have to stop for nachos!

The happy hour is good, but not one of the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in my most recent experience here. We sat down at the tables in the bar area and ordered dinner. We ordered a filet mignon and salmon, both came out cold. It took our waiter about ten minutes to come back to our table, he took the food back and it came back a second time Luke warm! So at this point, we had the waiter grab who we think was the manager, and she didn't apologize and blamed it on the air vents. I am really surprised by this customer service at an upscale restaurant. The manager rudely grabbed our plates away and said I'll see what I can do. She never came back to the table! I don't know if I'll ever come back again, and I once considered myself a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I have been staying in the hotel off and on for the few months. I tend to sit at the bar and chat with the bartenders . They are always amazing, and always make me feel welcome! 

I dine out in lots of towns, the guest service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Ate here with spouse and close friend on a Friday evening pre-concert, so on the early side. In the suddenly trendy Tremont neighborhood. Ready with our reservation, seated immediately in a nice sized dining area, among the first tables of the evening. 
Nice menu, plenty of great choices. We select fish, salad, app, wine... then the server returns to tell about the specials. All of us want the walleye on bucatini, which sounds great, so friend switched to the swordfish with clams dish. We order Poke Nachos as an app, and spouse got a pear salad. Wine was Cherry Hill from Oregon's Willamette Valley, interestingly on of several Oreo selections. Good job sommelier!
Food and wine were great, service efficient and well trained, atmosphere elegant and understated. Perfect. 5 Stars across the board. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I won a $100 gift card through a Twitter \"contest\" given by the generous chef and owner, Rocco Whalen.

HOLY SCHMOLE, you guys. This was one of the best meal's I've ever had. Rather, my boyfriend's meal was one of the best I've ever had. I went safe and had the pasta dish with goat cheese and chicken. It was quite good. However, my boyfriend went for the surf & turf - a steak laid over a bed of pasta and lobster.

IT WAS THE BEST THING I'VE EVER TRIED. Every few minutes, I'd expectantly open my mouth in my boyfriend's direction so he could feed me another bite of steak or lobster. I am sure it was a goofy sight. Maybe goofier was the look in my eye when I chewed that delicate steak (and I am not even a meat person, AT ALL!), slowly, sensually savoring every bite like it was my last.

You guys, I am not even being dramatic.

Our budget doesn't allow for that kind of fancy eating every day, but for special occasions, I'm going for that surf & turf.

[pro-tip: we both found the dessert to not be worth it. go get some tremont scoops for a cheap dessert]."}
{"text":"Oh my my my..where do i begin. Host staff made us wait 15 minutes before our table was ready. Ok that was fine. Secondly our carolina nachos were cold...they where too soggy from the cheez wiz substance poured heavily over the chips. DONT NOT ORDER THE LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE! For 36.00 dollars..its velveta shells and and that nasty cheese wiz with slices of lobster. .yes thin slices of lobster i didnt even know you could this slice lobster? The only good thing was the shrimp and grits..lol. The music was good when it kept playing it would stop at random times. Very inconsistent for the price point we could  of went to Merts heart and soul or Flemings in the epicenter. The best thing is the view. Damm shame valet parking, Great views our food sucked! Point blank. Dont waste your time just go for drinks and pizza. If anyone is listening there..

Heres what you need.

Hire a live DJ
Wait staff needs to be more customer service driven
Better tasting food.
And why is it so damm dark?"}
{"text":"The food and view at Fahrenheit in charlotte are top notch! From the moment you walk in the door your greeted with warm smiles, 
Once you sit down and experience the view and the five-star cuisine at this restaurant you'll wish you could come back every day! 
The beef short ribs are to die for and the wine selection is Impressive To say the least.  Every time you go they have between five and six specials to choose from, And You can't go wrong if you decide to choose a special in lieu of the menu .The servers are knowledgeable, friendly and engaging. (That's a rare occurrence  these days)  If you have room, you have to try their pastry chefs desserts, They are out of this world!!!! 
I highly recommend this restaurant. It's not just a special occasion or date night restaurant, it can and should be an every day restaurant.
Go to Fahrenheit in Charlotte and have a night you'll never forget!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you've read the other reviews, you already know that the main selling point for this restaurant is the view. The view alone will get people through the door. Sadly, the food will not bring them back -- save, maybe visits with guests from out-of-town. 

Beyond the view, the only other selling point was our server. She was phenomenal. Gave great explanations of the dishes, suggested a wine pairing, and let us linger before sending out our dessert, even during restaurant week. 

My mister got the chicken spring rolls, hanger steak, and cheesecake, while I got the calamari, hanger steak, and bread and butter cake. The chicken spring roll was strangely served. I was thinking it would come out like a true spring roll in rice paper or something maybe similar to an egg roll. Nope, not at all. I typically like calamari, but the pieces of squid were legit encased in rock hard breading. The hanger steak was way salty and way too saucy. The desserts were the highlights of our meal.

Overall, the food was meh. If you've even taken a cruise on a Carnival ship, I would put the quality, taste, and portion size on par with cruise food. Not the most flattering comparison, right?"}
{"text":"I'll break it down for some of you busy people who need to read and book it right now.

Interior: 3.5/5, 
View: 5/5, 
Food: 4/5,
Service: 4.5/5,
Drinks: 4/5,
Location: 3.5/5,
Hip scale: 3.5/5.

I think it's a place everyone goes to check out the famous view like how bentley's once was. And I remember loving the view, the service, the interior at Bentley's but not so much the food. A turnoff for me because I am going there mainly to eat.

I went to Fahrenheit for a functiom. So don't take my word for it but the food they served was fantastic. The thin pizza, the pop corn shrimp, the galbi slices were awesome. Especially because the fat on the meat was still there. I love that part.

Drinks were good too. I had a few jack & cokes and a couple of glasses of wine. They were all good. Enough to make me happy after three. And the service was fantastic as well. This is something I lool at after a restaurant's food/drinks. And they passed with flying colors.

The view... Yes, the view that you see on every Charlottean's Facebook at least once. It is not overrated. In other words, it's good. I've already been to my buddy's who live there a few floors down so it wasn't new. But nevertheless a great view of the pretty, miniature-manhattan skyline.

Here's the bad news. It's not the best looking restaurant itself. The view and the building looks pretty from outside but the restaurant looks very narrow and small when you first walk in. I thinks it's mainly because the first thing you see is the large glass window with the view not so far from the entrance. Yes, that could impress some people but not me. The fine dining section was separated on the right from the bar side in the middle and the left. And that also was a bit of a disappointment for me. A place that wants to build up a name for fine dining and a trendy bar should not have a hundred thousand screens with every game that's on that night. Certainly shouldn't be one of the first things you see.

Lastly, I can't help mentioning that the building entrance is a bit unwelcoming. The desk clerk was great but I'm talking the floor plan, and the layout. The building's anchor tenant is a business hotel, and Skye condos. So the doors, and tbe entrance itself are small and narrow. It is more homelike that way. But not so welcoming if you are just going for a drink.

That's my two cents. Hope they help!"}
{"text":"Chef Rocco rocks!

I had the privilege of attending an event and trying roughly 1/3 of the items on the menu...great stuff!

This place is a gem in Cleveland's hip Tremont neighborhood.

Make sure you try the Kobe beef short ribs.

The menu changes seasonally so you won't have a chance to become bored with the same dishes.

This place is popular so be prepared for a crowd at peak hours."}
{"text":"I truly had a 5 star experience from the moment I walked thought the lobby of the hotel to get on the elevator until the time we left.  Why?! I'm going to tell you:

We came here because we were celebrating a recent promotion between the two of us. My hubs.  We were staying at the Ritz so naturally we needed to have a place that matched in a dinning experience. We walked from the Ritz over to the restaurant (in 6 inch Red Bottoms) and I was still in a good.  We walked into the hotel lobby and the receptionist pointed us to the correct elevator and told us what floor even before we had a chance to ask.

I really had mid-grade expectation because I know sometimes when a restaurant is all the rage or hyped up it can be a huge let down.  Or it's the opposite where there are so so reviews and I end up loving it. Anyway...

Our server was awesome.  We liked him...he had an interest in us and we took interest in him.  So easy to talk to!! He saw that we wanted to take a picture out on the patio since the view was so stunning! He offered to take our picture for us! 

Hubs ordered the Steak and I ordered the halibut.  Both were cooked and flavored to perfection.  I've never seen my husband eat so fast and in utter silence.  Zoned and in the moment. Portion sizes were also bigger than I had expected.  Some fancy restaurants give you these small portions sizes with a \"Texas size\" price tag and it's annoying.  Not this place.  Sure it's expensive but I felt like it was well worth it."}
{"text":"So was really excited to come here with my out of town guests and I hear great things. I made a reservation for 8 but we only had 6, so when we arrived I told them. They said ok let us reset the table. Nope instead they stuck in the corner in a booth too small and then added a chair on the end. So they took our table and gave to someone else. 

First, it was literally 100degs in the corner they shoved us. We immediately asked why it was so hot and the waitress laughed and said yes it's the hottest table in the restaurant due to location. Instead of moving us to clearly a different table we had reserved, they let us sweat it out. It might sound extreme but it was so hot, half the table didn't order entrees because they were uncomfortable. Then with 6 people they added 20% gratuity which is ok if service is good but it showed they knew it was coming. She put the wine in a decanter but never poured it for us Until 20mins later when we asked why. The response was I thought you would do it yourself, the wine glasses are wide enough. Hmm pretty sure you are the waitress. The appetizers were all great but one. Dates, chips, steamed buns don't recommend the spring rolls. Goat salad was great but one of the members found the brown core of the salad in his. They came and apologized and did take it off the bill. Then manager came up had no idea who she was started talking and pointing at the pizzas and finally we figured out who she was when she mentioned the salad..kinda day unprofessional. I got the short rib, not worth $40 by any means. Was really fatty throughout where usually only a strip on the top. The pizzas were really good and can be shared with 2-3ppl. 

Overall it was so uncomfortable that we had to keep going to the other side of the restaurant to cool off, their response was its an open air concept restaurant.. Um sorry to inform you but that would mean the windows opened...they don't. It's no different than any other restaurant. The air vent above us never blew any air and they could care less. The service needs to be better and quit talking down to people when you are the server. I don't see myself coming back even though the food was good. They need a serious attitude adjustment, I guess the customer is right doesn't apply here. It's unfortunate because the apps were really good and this place has amazing views."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars since I just a two drinks without dinner. Hopefully Cleveland cooks well. However the Peaky Blinders looking bartender wearing glasses leaves much to be desired. I asked for a dirty martini, he gave me a martini. Include a glass of wine and he stated $40. I decided to run a tab incase this could turn into an expensive night. After sitting,in the way to deep lounge chairs, on the balcony we left. A different tender ran up the bill and the drinks were $12 a piece not $20. I guess someone knows how to skim from the top..."}
{"text":"We made a large reservation for a team dinner well in advance but had to increase the size of the party by a couple of people on a busy night. Thankfully, the hostess Mercury was accommodating despite the difficult request. Thank you!

We really enjoyed all the appetizers ordered, especially the Wood Grilled Avocado and the Lobster Roll. The Seared Ahi Tuna was really delicious and it was the right portion considering all the appetizers we ate. 

The view from the restaurant was what drew us in and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"AMAZING start to finish! From the Mussel Appetizers to the Lobster Mac and cheese and Kobe Short Ribs. And unparalleled service and attention to detail. Definitely a must try when in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Just amazing! Delicious food, amazing view, cozy atmosphere and great service. I was an hour late for my reservation, yet they found a table for my party of 6 in literally 1 minute. This place is a must either you visit the queen city or you live here! Loved it and I'll come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular.  Been here a few times and everything has always been great.  Great service, great food and a spectacular view of the city."}
{"text":"Do not go to this place for the food. Just go for drinks and to enjoy the downtown view."}
{"text":"Was excited to go to Fahrenheit Saturday June 10th. We had nachos for an appetizer they were okay nothing special just chips with some cheese sauce a small amount of bacon and green onions. I had the \"Kobe\" short rib no sauce and teriyaki noodles too salty. My friend Lynee had lobster mac and cheese but the chef forgot to put lobster in the dish. After giving it to the server to add lobster it took a while to come back to the table. Lynee asked for it to be boxed to go and we couldn't believe how small the container was. Lynee asked the server\" did you get all of the pasta in that small container\". He didn't give her an answer. So I can truly say we will not return to Fahrenheit."}
{"text":"the food was incredible tiny portions left me hungry. Maybe I should have ordered soup and salad too."}
{"text":"Was visiting charlotte for a conference, and this was one of the closest restaurants. I didnt really have a whole lot of time so even though this was 3 stars, i saw some positive reviews and thought this might be nice because I could sit up on the patio and at least take in a nice view of charlotte. The patio was honestly ok- I had a nice view of the surrounding buildings which wasnt much to write home about. I have to abstain from alcohol right now so I was trying to look for virgin cocktails or just non-alcoholic drinks and there were literally none. Not even like a virgin bloody mary. From their \"vegetarian menu\", I got the charlotte nachos without bacon which were basically potato chips with queso and cheddar with a little bit of scallions. It was so salty. It was $15 for a huge portion but so not worth it. The atmosphere is pretty - gorgeous interior. kind of a business-bar vibe. A lot of folks getting together for after conference dinner and drinks. Service was nice. Thats really what i am giving 3 stars for, which I honestly think is kind of generous."}
{"text":"Drinks are ok. Nothing special. Pricey. View is great. But they rent out the porch and don't communicate that. Walked over for a drink and view and got shown the door. Cool that it's rented out. Bad that that is not communicated on social media or website."}
{"text":"Great views with sky high prices to match, but I felt the food and atmosphere did make the final bill worth it. 

We had a Sunday night meal here which meant fewer people and a more coordinated effort from the kitchen. Our server was Kevin and he was excellent and hilarious. We started with chorizo stuffed dates and crispy cauliflower. The dates were not only stuffed but also bacon wrapped bites of pure heaven. This dish is highly recommended. The cauliflower was meh and not worth mentioning. 

For main courses we had the salmon, pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped scallops special, lamb loin and wild mushroom pizza. Portions are HUGE. Seriously, where were some of the other reviewers on here eating? The pizza was nearly an 18\" pie; salmon was a generous size on a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes. Pork tenderloin had a sweet flavor w sweet potato mash and a bourbon sauce. We estimated the lamb loin to be at least 10 ozs and it came with fries as well. The scallops were the only normal sized dish and came w three to a plate on a bed of risotto. Everything was tasty, well cooked and well presented - even the pie which had a chewy crust and truffle oil. We ended our meal with the chocolate pot de creme. This was a large soufflé dish of cold, rich chocolate creme topped w a caramel popcorn ball which oddly worked really well w the chocolate. 

You might wonder why not five stars after all this raving? The reality is the food and service is solid, but not memorable. There wasn't a dish that made me feel like I had to come back again (except the dates!) especially with those price tags. This is the kind of place I would recommend visiting once to experience especially for the views, but there are other places in Charlotte that merit repeat visits."}
{"text":"I wouldn't expect such a cool bar located in a Hyatt Place, but that's exactly what I found in Fahrenheit! The views are amazing and the atmosphere is great. The hostesses were very pleasant. My friends and I had seats at the bar and life was pretty grand. 

Unfortunately, the service at the bar left a lot to be desired. The bartender during our visit was aloof and too busy drinking his own beer to pay much attention to his customers. My friend ordered a sparkling rosé after being led to believe that there was one on the menu, but she was presented with a cocktail, instead. It seemed like anytime we needed something, whether it was another drink or the check, we practically had to lean over the bar, even though there weren't many people there. 

I'd definitely return but I'd hope that service is improved next time."}
{"text":"I dined at Fahrenheit with my family on a recent trip to Cleveland.   We had a reservation, so we were seated quickly and were able to enjoy a table outside on a warm night.   At first glance, I was underwhelmed with the atmosphere (plain interior, and the plastic chairs for the outdoor seating were uncomfortable on such a warm day), but I am impressed that restaurants of this type are able to thrive in Tremont.  (Tremont was pretty dodgy when I moved away from Cleveland many years ago).

We were served promptly, and my server was very good about making accommodations for food allergies, though we felt a bit of pretension from the restaurant staff.  Fortunately it did not detract from our enjoyment of the meal.  

Now, for our food:  my siblings started with the chicken spring rolls, which they seemed to enjoy, and I tried the speck bruschetta as a starter.  The bruschetta was delicious, though a bit oily.  For entrees, my brothers had the filet mignon and pork shank, while I ordered the pork tenderloin.   When my brother's pork shank arrived at the table, I had instant buyer's remorse because his order looked *so* good, but upon tasting my meal, I was very pleased with my decision.  The pork shank was extremely tender but a bit underseasoned for my tastes;  the accompanying honey-mascarpone polenta was TDF, though.   The filet and mashed potatoes were competently prepared and tasty as one would expect, but the real gem of the night was my coffee and mustard crusted pork tenderloin, on a bed of spinach and maple mashed sweet potatoes.  The pork was tender, flavorful, and melded wonderfully with the spinach and sweet potato. 

In addition to our food, we tried the house moscow mules (quite good), martinis and a bottle of wine.  Bottles under $100 are 50% off on Mondays, which will give me an excuse to dine here again on a weeknight on my next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"The slow cooked Kobe short rib may have  been the best short rib I've ever had. They  also had a special appetizer \"Beef ravioli with a ricotta cream sauce.\" if they should have it, I insist you try it.

I had 2 Moscow mule classic cocktails that came in a special mug. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Visited here in the past and my other review was a 5 star. Nevertheless, I have taken them down to 3 stars for this visit because it was just okay. Our waitress was not the nicest and towards the beginning of our dinner acted like she was being inconvenienced by our presence. Told my friend who wanted calamari and a side for her meal that they no offered side a la carte. Eventually, she was allowed to get what she wanted, but it shouldn't have been issue. It bothers me when large groups, where the gratuity is included, are met with sub par service. The food was okay."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this review is for customer service, not the food.  We had called ahead and scheduled engagement photos there a few days prior and spoken with someone (we thought her name was Brooke) at the restaurant who confirmed with a manager and told us we could have 3:30-4pm to shoot.  We show up and the \"event manager\" says no, that she doesn't know anyone by the name of Brooke and in short that we cannot shoot there, and that if we want to schedule it's $300 and between 10am-3pm.  She was very rude about it and turned us away, even though we called for an appointment ahead of time, and were there, in our finery, with a photographer on the clock. If she had been nicer, maybe, but this \"event planner\" was a jerk. Will not be patronizing in the future."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and GREAT view. It's an expensive place but the experience definitely makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"My braised short ribs were delicious! Although-I wouldn't say they were anything special. I'd give it 3 stars based on the food. The extra star is for the view you get. It's at the top of a hotel/condominium building, and there was a Carolina football game going on that night so we had a view of the city. Carolina folks are really into their football team, so the buildings were all lit up in the Carolina blue. It was beautiful. I didn't get there in time to sit down and enjoy a cocktail on the patio before dinner, but the patio seemed really casual and relaxed. You could easily head up there for a drink without doing dinner."}
{"text":"Went to Fahrenheit for their friends and family night.  First off, how generous of Chef Rocco to go all out!!!  Most soft openings give you limited selections but not him.  The views are phenomenal, the food was fantastic.  Specifically the tomato basil soup, goat cheese salad, and lobster mac!  The staff was also very gracious and friendly.  I can't wait to go back and try the small plates!  This place will be a hit!"}
{"text":"Great Views!  Excellent Chef!  We came to Fahrenheit for our anniversary dinner and it was an experience.  The views of Charlotte are beautiful.  The grilled cilantro jalapeño shrimp appetizer was delicious.  Our entrees were great in that the quality of food is outstanding.  We got the snapper and scallops.  They are not filling but just enough.  And you will still have room for dessert - give the caramel bourbon banana bread pudding a try as it was awesome!  The only recommendation I would make for this restaurant is to its hostess and waiters - hostesses were not very welcoming or attentive.  Our waiter was just ok, very slow (and I mean we were early and the only seated table in the restaurant)...but a restaurant like this needs staff with a little more personality, which is the only reason for my 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is the best new restaurant I've tried in awhile and it was great because it was on my bucket list. We sat in the bar for happy hour and were surprised when the server brought us free bacon. It was awesome! We ordered way too many things off the happy hour menu including pizza, burger, tacos, cheesesteak and sangria. The red sangria was slightly better than the white. The pizza, burger and tacos were amazing! The cheesecake was just okay. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved it! But wait. We waited in the lounge for your table which has a bar and tables and a view to the outside.The waitress had no personality and no smile. She took forever with our drinks. We thought that was the beginning of a very disappointing evening. How wrong we were! Our server was Cassidy. What a doll. Big smile, warm, friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, just awesome. She suggested apps for us and shes tried them all. Thats my girl! Her suggestions were spot on delicious. We ordered the mini chicken meatball sliders with fresh mozzarella and red sauce(its gravy to this New Yorker) and I wondered why my Italian boyfriend would ever disgrace us by ordering a non-beef meatball. But, holy shit,  these were addictive !!!! Tender ground chicken, not dry, perfectly seasoned on a buttery toasted bun with melty mootz and sauce. I couldnt believe I loved them. I ordered the Crispy Tempura Rock Shrimp. Lightly battered and Fried, drizzled with a  light Creamy Honey Glaze on top of Crispy Rice Noodles. So Good, I ate leftovers for Breakfast. We also ordered the Burrata on crostini with Apricot and Heirloom Tomatoes. Wait, I don't think I got the tomatoes!! But, who cares? The creamy, fresh burrata with the sweet apricots on that crispy bread with a drizzle of honey was insanely simple and so good. Oh, and Baldie ordered the Boston Lettuce Wedge. One of the best salads ever, Putanas! The Stilton cheese was mild, the dressing was creamy, theapplewood bacon added a nice crunch. Dessert was Cissady's suggestion and it rocked! It's called Hot Chocolate Entremet and its like a chocolate mousse with a ganache and a melted marshmallow on top. OMG!!! We are going back!! You should, too!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week with a group of friends. I got the Maine lobster roll, BBQ beef brisket ramen and angel food mango/passionfruit trifle. Maine lobster roll was served cold, had celery relish and sriracha aioli, very tasty. BBQ beef brisket ramen wasn't as good, the noodles were over cooked, the mushrooms were very sour and the broth was way too salty, pretty much like a sauce. The BBQ beef brisket and pork belly in the ramen were cooked very well though, and the soft boiled egg was right. The angel food mango/passionfruit trifle was pretty good, I liked the mango/passionfruit a lot, personally not a huge fan of angel food cake but it was good. My friends got the chorizo stuffed dates which they loved, the salmon and wasabi mashed potatoes which they also loved, and the Kobe beef short rib was great too. 
Very nice, classy atmosphere. Clean."}
{"text":"I always have good food at Fahrenheit. I had the Ahi Tuna nachos on my last visit here and let me tell you I will probably have those for starters on every visit here in the future. My friend was a little skeptical until she had a taste of mine. I assured she had a little of everything with her 1st bite she was so amazed at how the flavors all combined together she said it was her new fave. the calamari was good and my other friend had a simple cheese pizza that was also really good. you just cant beat the view as well as the upscale environment here I love it."}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre and over salted.not worth the money.  On the up side , top marks for ambiance."}
{"text":"I dare you to try this place for happy hour. 
I dare you to try out their happy hour pizza. 
I dare you to tell me this place isn't amazing! 

Happy hour here is delicious! Let's talk about the happy hour pizza that is bigger than my face for only $8. But let's talk about the delicious cheese on it....Brie, Parmesan, goat cheese, maple and chives all melted to perfection. Not too thick not too thin, just perfect. 

The drinks...WOW! $4 for a glass of delicious red wine, sign me up! 

It doesn't get any better than this for the price. 

Try it, I dare you!"}
{"text":"This place is breathtaking! Had a business dinner here a few weeks ago and I am still thinking about the delicious scallops. Our server was so helpful and extremely polite. She made sure we were always taken care of and explained the menu very well for us. The drinks were amazing. I love that they serve warm bread with this delicious butter with chives before your meal. For dinner I had the scallops which were served with  creamy Cauliflower Purée, Brussels Sprouts, Bacon, Pomegranate Molasse. Everything about this dish was spectacular! For dessert I tried the Goat Cheese Cake which was served with spiced blueberry compote, black pepper pecans, orange-basil sorbet. It was very different but delicious. The views from this establishment were amazing! I could just go there and sit by their rooftop fireplace and enjoy the views. 

I highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was more than we expected for our daughters 18th birthday dinner.  Service was fantastic and the portions were generous!  The views and outdoor fire pits were nice! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have come here for drinks and the view previously. Tonight we came for a friends birthday dinner and it was amazing. The appetizer was great and the service was fantastic. Will definitely come back for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for cocktails and appetizers and each time have been pleased. Most recently, we went with a larger group. We made reservations weeks in advance. The day of, they called to let us know that they can't honor our reservation because we weren't eating dinner there (even though we were ordering appetizers). They told us that if we are coming for drinks and apps, it's first come first serve. First of all, I think that's kind of lame. But second of all, and most importantly, why wait until the day of to tell us?!

Anyways, we got there and got a table outside that was a community table. Given our big party, there was only room for three or four people to sit at the other end. I was okay with that. Our party of six ordered several drinks each and apps to share. We got the Charlotte nachos (which was good and a portion good for sharing) and the grilled avocado (sooooooo good but needed at least double the amount of bread with it). Our waitress was somewhat attentive but I got the feeling that she had a ton of tables. We had to flag her down if we needed something. But she was nice nonetheless. 

In all, the view is pretty. On a good day, it's nice to sit outside. The food is pricey but tasty. The reservation mishap was a big deal to me just because I think it is reflection of customer service. I would give it 3.5 stars, so I'm gonna round it up to a 4."}
{"text":"We stopped in here with my boyfriend's family after pin bowling down the street, my boyfriend's dad has very specific tastes that he felt a lot of Tremont places wouldn't satisfy. We did not make a reservation and it was super crowded but we got lucky with 4 openings at the bar. The service was just as a good as a table. My family took my a few years back for my birthday and I think I enjoyed the recent experience from the bar even better. Everyone loved their food. Our group ordered everything ranging from pizza to salmon. I enjoyed wasabi potato puree type thing with my entree and it was seriously the best. I had them a few weeks ago and still crave them!! I want to go back just for this side!!"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend there are Valentine's day. Easily the best restaurant I have ever been to. She had the best steak I have ever tasted and I had the veal shoulder with some sort of pasta and mushroom sauce. She also had a blackberry sangria which was sweet, but delicious. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great service and most of all GREAT FOOD...It was well worth the praise and all the hoop-la.... Definitely returning very very soon!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Fahrenheit I booked a table for our anniversary. I really should have read some of these reviews first though. 

If the location wasn't so impressive my guess is they would have trouble filling the place. Strike one was when they sat us at our table. We asked if we could be moved closer to the window and they said \"no. It's reserved for a VIP\". I have no problem that it's reserved but am I supposed to be impressed that it is for a VIP? Strike two was that there was a whole in our table. Yes a whole. Strike three was the fact that it was our anniversary. They did nothing except say happy anniversary. Thanks

On the way out we had a conversation with one of the managers. She said that for anniversaries they provide a nice dessert. I guess we missed that. 

As for the food nothing was particularly good. Either over seasoned or no seasoning. 

I hope things improve here otherwise they are wasting a great view."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Ohio.

The happy hour is ridiculous -- bacon on the bar? Who does that? They do. Genius. Everything on the HH menu is cheap and fabulous.

On Mondays, they do half off all wine... which leads to drinking some delicious, buttery, normally stupid-expensive vino.

Short ribs...scallops...pizzas? All perfection.

Service is impeccable -- from a fun happy hour at the bar to a special occasion, they get it right. If you've ever met chef Rocco, you understand why this restaurant is so successful. Bravo."}
{"text":"went here to grab drinks and for the view

kind of lame that you can't stand by the railing to see the view.. you need to stand 3 feet away from the railing...

the bartender also messed up my drink order but i couldn't tell the waitress because she was nowhere to be found. when she finally came back, i told her and she said \"why didn't you tell me?!\" well i would have if you had ever checked up on us!

then i was still charged for my incorrect drink... kind of lame.

overall, chill place to lounge and grab drinks with friends."}
{"text":"First time visiting, hopefully it wont be the last. My friend invited my husband & I to join a group of friends for dinner last week. I'll admit, I was a little disappointed with the service for a number of reasons.

The main concern being:  My friend called to make reservations for a Friday night (our party was no larger than 8) and for some reason they gave her a hard time, claiming that the party was too big and that they would have to get back to her. Thankfully, things worked out for us but seriously- 8? A reservation for 8 is no different from 4 pairs of 2's randomly popping in. 
 

Otherwise, this place was cozy, intimate, and offered the most delicious pumpkin soup I have ever had!!! My husband got the duck fried rice and was more than happy to spend the rest of the evening in a puddle of his own drool, lol. It would be a great adventure to explore for anyone whose a  \"foodie\" at heart :)"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend the cleveland nachos. They are delicious. The short rib is very good, but keep in mind it is really rich and heavy (not a bad thing). I would recommend this place to try out."}
{"text":"I only tried a few of the appetizers but I was busy networking so I didn't pay too much attention.  Let's start with the view. IMHO, its the best rooftop bar in the queen city. They have a cool outdoor patio and although it was too warm for the fireplace, it looked awesome! It was a busy place for a Thursday happy hour so I'm eager to go back soon.  I had an extra dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and two more to follow :).  This place knows how to make a good martini, so if that's your thing....try it!"}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner w my lovely wife. Hottest day in Charlotte and not much cooler inside. Sweated through appetizers, salads and entrée."}
{"text":"We only had drinks so I can't attest to the food, but the view was great and well worth the price for a drink or too. Our server was awesome and we always had water with our drinks. I would recommend for a once in a while thing."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit only earned the one star because of the view. Otherwise it deserves a ZERO. we went for drinks and dinner. 7 servers walked by us not one offered to seat us or even talk to us. We finally got the bartender's attention. She was rude but told us the patio was open. No one came to take our order. After 20 min we left. We told the front staff and manager. They weren't apologetic or even very nice."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is a great place to dine in Charlotte. It brings high end food to fried chicken and grits city. You have a view of the whole city from your table or walk outside an have a cocktail in the fresh charlotte air. The bar is fun and exciting for young and old. They use local farm fresh ingredients. An there staff was on top of there game. If you want great food with an amazing view. Try it you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love this place! We go here all of the time for the food and atmosphere and the views!"}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is all about the city view.  If there is a tourist trap bar in Charlotte, I think this would be it.

Atmosphere - Hot (on this evening, literally), fire...fire...intense evening sun, noisy, nicely set up (except why are there bright lights on outside in the balcony area during the night that take away from the beautiful view of the city?), crowded, fancy/ trendy wanna-be peps, and Thursday evening business travelers laying waste to their expense accounts.

Service - Accommodating, helpful, pretentious air...but expected to make the place feel special.

Food - To me, it is fancy-sounding appetizers and pricey drinks that mainly makes up Fahrenheit.  The place does offer a full dinner menu, but I was here for apps and drinks on this night.  My table ordered a few items: Spring Rolls, Mr. Fungi Roasted Mushroom Pizza, and Chorizo Stuffed & Bacon Wrapped Dates.  While the wrapped dates sounded delicious, I did not have an opportunity to try them, as they went quickly.  I did get to sample the pizza and spring rolls, which were ok but nothing that made me go \"wow.\"   The apps were standard fancy bar fare of super thin pizza and indistinguishable spring rolls.  I should have grabbed a date when I had the chance.

Overall - Fahrenheit does have a very nice view of the city.  I am not sure where else in the CLT you could get such a nice view.  For that you should come here for at least one drink.  While the \"look at me\" crowd, pricey drinks, and so-so apps were what I expected as soon as I heard we were going here; the blazing evening sun overtaking the cool a/c was something I didn't expect.  Though by its name, I should have at least anticipated it."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit is one of the harder reservations to snag on Restaurant week.  'Regular menu' price points are high, dress is attractive, drink prices are sky high.  So at $35 for three courses, needless to say, this is one of the primo deals you want to score a Friday or Saturday night.  

A-OK sums up my much anticipated visit to Fahrenheit.  We went on the last night of Restaurant Week and the kitchen did a good job promptly churning out the limited Restaurant Week menu items in pretty rapid time, they'd had 10 days to get into a routine and the menu offerings were selected for heavy volume and ease of holding and preparation, which I understand.

Fahrenheit is a beautiful restaurant on the 21st floor of the Hyatt, overlooking the Charlotte skyline.  There are some outstanding tables that overlook the fire and skyline and some tables that really disappoint (the ones next to the hostess stand when you first come in.) We were seated over by the glass enclosed kitchen and I'd add our specific table to the \"worst of\" list because we were the last table, right next to the kitchen door, which had servers scurrying in and out non-stop.  

On the plus side, I got to see what was being ordered all night but the non-stop motion was annoying and honestly, it's a 4-top they should simply remove from the floor as it's awkwardly placed and I'd have quickly complained had I been paying regular menu prices.  The table of 4 that arrived after us with two teenage children was given a prime skyline view table which annoyed me as I could see we spent a lot more money then they did by the end of the night.

We waited for about 10 minutes before we met our server and he took our drink order.  He was friendlyish and took the time to recommend an off the Restaurant Week appetizer, the Ahi Poke Nachos, that sounded delicious and I'd like to try on another visit, in addition to letting us know his favorite appetizer on the RW menu was the avocado.  Water took another 10 minutes.  Delicious pretzel bread arrived well after the apps.

My husband was surprised to see they have Pisco on the menu and ordered an off-the-menu Pisco Sour, which he said was only ok.  I tried the Phoenix in Flight: Blackberry infused Pisco, Hennessy VSOP, lime juice, simple syrup, fresh blackberry, egg whites and Plum bitters, which tasted nice but came out to be a whopping $15 and I had two, oops.  Happily my husband loves me a lot. :)

Appetizers:
~Wood Grilled Avocado - Thai sweet soy, goat cheese crostini, lime, sea salt.  We received one half of an avocado filled with sweet cherry tomatoes and served with two crostini.  The sprinkle of cilantro was a nice touch. I noticed that this was a 1/2 portion of what is on the regular menu (2 halves, 3 goat cheese crostini, $9.50).
~Negi Maki Egg Rolls - American Wagyu beef, green onions, Asheville Cheddar, Katsu aioli.  I thought these would be amazing, but they were just egg rolls.  I love aioli but wasn't super fond of this sharp tasting version and even though I researched it, I couldn't figure out what Katsu aioli is (as opposed to Katsu, the deep fried breaded chicken).
~Crisp Calamari - Tega Hills farm greens, kimchi, Thai sauce.  Breading and fry are so important and this one missed the boat.

Entrees:
~Slow-Braised American Wagyu Short Ribs - teriyaki lo mein, roasted wild mushrooms, baby bok choy, apple syrup, toasted sesame.  This was the super-star of the night.  Served with chopsticks, every flavor on this dish worked together to elevate it head and shoulders above much I've tried recently.  $39 on the regular menu.

~Maine Lobster \"Mac & Cheese\" - Cognac reduction, chives, Brie & goat cheese, oven-dried tomatoes, pipette pasta.  I was so hopeful for this.  My tablemate and I both received just 4 bites each of lobster in this dish, a friend who went earlier in the week said they had a plethora of lobster in theirs.  Had I paid the regular price of $36 I'd have been upset.

~Grilled & Glazed Wild Caught Salmon - wasabi mashed potatoes, blood orange, Saikyo miso, sweet & sour cucumbers.  I desperately wanted to try this dish but due to the Pacific salmon warning out right now (Jan 29) I reluctantly passed.  But calling it out because it sounds fantastic and I saw plate after plate leaving the kitchen headed for tables. $25 on the regular menu.

Desserts:
~Double Fudge Brownie - caramel popcorn, chocolate sauce, chocolate tuile.  Dense, deep, dark chocolate for dense, deep, dark chocolate lovers.  Try another choice if you aren't a dense, deep, dark chocolate lover.

~Toffee Cake - Bourbon caramel, apple compote, toffee crumble.  Toffee cake was nice, bourbon caramel was so delicious you could drink it.  A teeny, tiny little ramekin (or just a stitch more on the cake) would have been delightful.

We walked outside on the terrace after dinner to enjoy the view and while it was bitterly cold, it made us all agree to come back and have cocktails one warm pleasant evening.  Beautiful view and fires."}
{"text":"Wow this place was remarkable!! My boyfriend and I didn't even make it off the elevator before I had to write a review. We shared The lobster Mac and cheese and filet, everything was absolutely delicious and the service was great. We are actually staying in the Hyatt Place downtown so this is very convenient and delicious and I'm so glad we went! We will be back and I will be recommending this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here. The berry sangria want the best I have ever had. I got the lobster Mac and cheese. I would not call it Mac and cheese but it was delicious. We had a few of the valentine's day specials and everything was delicious. I cannot wait to go back. If you have a chance to go for their valentine's day menu I would!"}
{"text":"Came here with some colleagues during a business trip for dinner and cocktails. We asked our hotel where they would recommend, and this was the place. Apparently it's very popular with professional athletes. I wouldn't know if we saw any as I'm not a big sports fan, but this was clearly a place where people go to be seen.

This place is hoppin', so make sure to make a reservation if you're eating and don't want to have to wait forever for a table. (We did and still had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated.) Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. The nachos are as insanely good as they are insanely bad for you, but a worthy food sin. The stuffed dates that were also recommended were fine, but didn't knock my socks off.

The table service bread was VERY good.

I got the kale and squash salad for my entree and it was fantastic. The citrus dressing really made it come alive and I didn't regret not getting the burger that I had *really* wanted. (One of my colleagues did get it and said it was excellent. I stole a french fry and they were also great.)

The cocktails were okay. Very expensive, but on price for a place like this and the quality of liquor they used. You're paying for the ambiance as well as the ingredients. 

There is a patio with a panoramic view of downtown Charlotte that you can't miss if you come here. It's worth staying for a drink to admire."}
{"text":"Surprised my boyfriend for his birthday and had 2 friends meet us there... this was explained when I made the initial reservation and to the hostess stand when the other couple arrived... yet the hostess stand still almost blew the surprise.

Once seated the service started off great but as the night continued the waitress gave us less attention and began paying more attention to an older and larger reservation. The kitchen did a great job on the appetizers (nachos and lobster bisque), as well as 3 of the 4 entrees.... however they miscooked the Kobe burger for my boyfriend and he was forced to reorder... so he chose the pork tenderloin... which proceeded to arrive at the table completely overlooked and grey inside. Thankfully he loved my seared rare salmon and switched his order to that instead.

During the ordering fiasco.. I also was forced to wait for close to 30 minutes for a glass of wine because the waitress forgot to put in the order. The restaurant handled both situations poorly in that I was still charged for the glass of wine and they comped our table the soup of the night (which no one had ordered). They should have comped my boyfriends meal after 2 kitchen mistakes.

The waitress brought out a dessert for my boyfriend which thankfully tasted pretty good, however, another table was also celebrating a birthday... and most of the wait staff sang to that person. No one came over to sing to my boyfriend.

The view was fantastic and the food tasted great however the customer service left a sour taste in my mouth. Would be hesitant to return."}
{"text":"My husband and I spent our anniversary there last night and had an amazing time. Staff was friendly and attentive and our server Sarah, was so helpful! Ordered the calamari, lobster mac and cheese, and short rib entree. Everything was great and you cant beat that gorgeous view. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Decent food, excellent service. The roof has a blazing fire that the owner (who is in Detroit) seems to be very attached to. It was 95 degrees and fire was blazing."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner tonight and had the most amazing server ever, kala! She was awesome and was so helpful in assisting me in veganizing 2 of their dishes on their new menu! I chose the Brussels and the avocado, seriously so delicious! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"It's a fun atmosphere with excellent service. I had the sweet corn and lump crab cavatelli, and it was so very well done. Our server Mic was friendly, helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Everything looked fancy but when I got to the menu I was let down. I guess I expected better food or more options for a place so expensive. I will say I had what I enjoyed. First I placed an order for a house Cabernet. After all the other drinks came, I waited and waited. After two waiters tried to take my wine glass I finally said \"I ordered wine, can you check on it?\" The waiter was very apologetic. It wasn't a big deal to me plus we were a group of 14, so it could have slipped his mind. No biggie. My friend and I decided to split a \"mr fungi\" pizza. Trust me, the pizzas are huge so you will want to share! It was very flavorful but really, I wasn't in the mood for pizza. The check came, I was shocked a house Cabernet was $12.50. I don't mind paying for good wine but a house wine over $10...? Anyways, we thanked the waiter, Corbin, and made our way outside for pictures. Overall, it was a great experience just not what I expected menu wise. Also, they REALLY need air conditioning on all the time. I was sweating just sitting."}
{"text":"Go for the view on a warm night before sunset...and have a drink. Makes me happy to see the beauty of Charlotte up close. Food is decent enough (no complaints or raves) but think the larger appeal is the view!"}
{"text":"I had business in Charlotte, and came to Fahrenheit on the recommendation of a friend who lives here. Great food, exceptional service, reasonable prices. Next time I'm in Charlotte, I will definitely be coming back. Special mention to Lynn, who works there. She put a smile on my face."}
{"text":"This is a view not a restaurant. The food always disappoints.  

I've been here a number of times (at least 10). I want to like it. I stay in the attached hotel regularly. The restaurant provides room service, which is equally as disappointing. 

Tonight I had the Kobe short ribs which I was told was the \"what we are known for.\" If so, they are known for pushing a dish they don't know how to cook. The short ribs were served boneless which is not the preferred way, but that wasn't the problem. Instead of the fall apart tender that is expected with short ribs, especially a special product like Kobe beef, they were so tough I had trouble chewing them. The fat was not rendered. They were not prepared properly. 

the ribs were served on top of a bed of noodles. the noodles were so overcooked, they were just a bowl of mush. My mother doesn't overcook spaghetti this badly. 

I was curious about the 'roasted avocado' appetizer. It was an elementary presentation of stale  french bread topped with goat cheese and a smear of avocado, with a cherry tomato on top. No integration of flavors. No sophistication whatsoever, just a bunch of ingredients piled on top of each other. 

this place has a great view - the BEST in Charlotte. Come here and have a drink or a beer (no good options for wine by the glass), do NOT eat here or you will be disappointed. you have been warned."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! Charlotte is a small city that loves big city things, and Fahrenheit definitely has the feel of a big city restaurant. I've had the opportunity to dine here a couple times and I have more positives than negatives to share about the place. Great ambiance if you're looking for a loud, lively venue, and a nice view of the city. They have a pretty nice cocktail menu and an alright list of wines by the glass. The food - some items are great, and some mediocre. I was not impressed with their ahi tuna or cauliflower appetizers, but I did enjoy the chorizo stuffed dates! The kale salad was a good size, but lacked in flavor. In the main course the halibut was absolutely delicious, the spice grilled lamb loin was great but the king crab ramen was kinda boring (I had high expectations from this dish!). The fungi pizza was yum, and oh I almost forgot to mention the honey whipped herb butter that comes with the bread - amazing. And finally, the rice pudding dessert was less than memorable. All in all I think there were some amazing items on the menu, while there were some that weren't worth the high $$ you were paying! I'd recommend this restaurant for a good weekend dinner with friends or family, a celebratory get together perhaps, or perhaps for their chic bar if you're looking for a hip place to enjoy a few
Cocktails!"}
{"text":"Came here with two friends on a Friday night. We ordered chorizo stuffed in dates and mussels. Appetizers are good but the entrees are not so ideal. I ordered Kobe beef with noodles, but it turned out to be too salty to eat. I am pretty disappointed"}
{"text":"Our server was spot on with the wine recommendation. We ended up getting 2 bottles (for a party of 5). I had the watermelon salad as a starter, while hubby got the Cleveland nachos. Both dishes were scrumptious- enough sweet and savory to tickle the palette for the next course.

For entrees, I had the rib steak course- meat was grilled to order (medium). However, the pesto cream/sauce overpowered the true star of dish, the meat itself. The side dishes were ok (french beans and potatoes), nothing exceptional. The hubby ordered the lobster mac and cheese. Now this one was a winner! Creamy and savory, yet still a comfort food. I can't say anything about the lobster since I'm allergic to shellfish.

Off to desserts! This is an area that needs to be improved on since I was not impressed with the level of creativity. Don't get me wrong. It was good (Ohio \"buckeye\"), but then it was not spectacular enough to make me remember it for ages.

Overall, the trek to Tremont after the RNC was worth it since we got to try something new when we decided to dine at Fahrenheit. Now, will we go back there soon? No. Maybe sometime in the future. For now, we are off to trying other restaurants in that area."}
{"text":"Had the salmon and it was great.  Menu very limited.  I would say that it's a great place for the ambiance and outside deck as well as the view of downtown Charlotte.  Service was good but pretty loud inside.  Skirt steak was really good.  Scallops were enjoyed by another in our party.  Lots of choices in downtown.  But food was good."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I went here for brunch. We always wanted to come here. When our plates came out the  18.00 crab Benedict, our biscuits were stale and luke warm. No side came with the meal so we had to purchase an additional side which we got potatoes. They came out dry and luke warm as well. 
I asked to speak to a manager addressing the biscuits. I asked her if they were made recently bc they tasted stale and she told me they were made this Am. It's 2:00 in the afternoon and your charging  18.00 for a plate with a biscuit that was made in the Am?! I don't understand why you wouldn't make them hourly at least. My food tasted  like it was under a heat lamp all am and we were sent out left overs. We are foodies and can assure you this place is smoke and mirrors which is sad bc it's a beautiful space. Big disappointment"}
{"text":"After checking out the Tremont Art Walk, the gf and I decided to try our luck with OpenTable and see if we could insinuate ourselves into a fancy dinner.  I'm glad we did, because we were able to make a reservation 10 minutes before we were seated, and watched lots of people get turned away during our short wait. 

Once we got to our table we both had a lot of trouble deciding what to order because most of it looked pretty good.   Our friendly server was helpful with input that let us narrow down our choices, and having ordered, we were looking forward to our meal.

We continued to look forward to it for the next 45 minutes.  

Our server did apologize, explaining that the kitchen was really backed up.  Seeing how busy it was, and taking into account that it was an Art Walk night, we were ok with this.  In the meantime we received a couple of extra plates of the delicious bread and we both fell in love with the herbed honey butter.  

Eventually our pizzas arrived, hot out of the oven.  Gf loved her Mediterranean, and I am now a believer that the Lobster Pizza deserves all of the accolades it's received.  Here's the thing, we ordered the potato nachos as an appetizer, and our entrees beat them to the table.  After the three plates of bread and the long wait, we ended up canceling them, though we were a little disappointed because they sounded delicious.  

We will very likely go back, as we did enjoy the food and would like to explore then menu, but for now, my rating is lower than it might have been because of the wait.  I am confident that if we went under different circumstances this would be a 4 or 5 star experience, and in all fairness we did get in by the skin of our teeth on a super busy night so we'll see how it goes next time."}
{"text":"Fahrenheit was the latest stop on my self-guided eating tour of Tremont. I'm issuing 4 stars, because it meets my basic expectations for fine dining, but 3.5 stars is what I really want to give. 

I guess my complaint is somewhat trivial, but this place seemed to lack a sense of uniqueness or distinctiveness or direction. Almost too generic and safe all the way around. It's like the Tremonty version of Hyde Park Grille. The menu seemed very safe to me. (No entree specials were even offered to us on a Saturday night.) Don't get me wrong, the food and drink were good, and the service was professional (if a tad bit slow), but I really struggle how to answer the following question: 

 \"I really want to go back to Fahrenheit because  _______.\" 

a) I haven't eaten in 4 hours.
b) I like spending a few hundred dollars on dinner because I'm exceedingly poor at managing my personal finances.
c) I got confused when I made reservations and thought I was going to \"Fire\" in Shaker Square instead.
d) I like the deeply-unsettling painting of Chef Rocco wielding a pair of bloody knives on display in the dining room.

Dunno. Fahrenheit just doesn't seem to have that compelling or unique aspect that differentiates itself....neither in the decor, atmosphere, nor food. There are so many good options when it comes to fine dining in Cleveland, you need to give me something distinctive so I'll make the effort to come back. Fahrenheit just didn't do that. 

So, anyhow, I don't want to dwell too much on the negative. The food was pretty damn good, as one would expect. The arugula and Lake Erie creamery goat cheese salad was fresh and tasty, with the salty and bitter arugula in a precarious balance with the goat cheese. It was perhaps a bit one-dimensional and could have used another ingredient or two. For the entree, I had the coffee-and-mustard-crusted pork tenderloin, which was excellent. There was a nice contrast between the charred pork and the maple sweet potatoes, and the complex Asian vegetables were an elegant garnish. After I paired it all with a bottle of dusty red Dundee Hills Oregon pinot, I was really satisfied with the quality of the meal. 

The one thing that at our table that didn't look very appetizing was the lobster mac 'n cheese. Tasty enough, but compared to the other colorful and sophisticated entree presentations, the lobsta' mac kinda had the depressing yellow-brown color of fresh dog vomit. (Is Andrew Wyeth in the kitchen, working a tube of yellow ochre #5?) And speaking of the lobster mac n' cheese, why is this stupid dish on every menu of every restaurant nowadays, anyhow? Have you noticed this? It's ubiquitous. Is it a state-mandated menu item?  I understand that lobster mac n' cheese represents a singular convergence of the recent comfort-food craze and our crustacean preoccupations, but I'm finding it at restaurants where it simply doesn't belong. (I mean, what the hell is it doing on a contemporary Asian-American menu like Fahrenheit?) It seems to me like a cop out, like a way to shamelessly sneak in a $25 penne pasta dish to exploit the masses. Where's the originality, chefs? Mac n' cheese? That's all you got? You could put lobster meat on a turd and people would still order it."}
{"text":"The boyfriend called for reservations and told them in advance that it was my birthday. Upon arrival, I was wished a happy birthday and we were seated by the window with great views! Then we were given a small app, compliments of the he'd. Delicious! Our waiter was super nice and the timing of the apps and meal were perfectly timed. I was so full with the yumminess, and I never order desert.., that didn't stop him from bringing out a birthday surprise! It was the perfect size since I was stuffed already. :-) excellent birthday meal! Excellent views! Excellent service!!"}
{"text":"Nice view, big portions, BUT too noisy, 0 sound isolation, drinks are overpriced, service sucks and food is very very very salty(everything we ordered: salad, steak, pizza)!!!! I'm not local, but don't think I would go back for anything except glass of wine in outside area."}
{"text":"I am having a very difficult time deciding on an appropriate rating for our experience at Fahrenheit.  Some of it was incredible, others regrettable.  I guess 3 will have to do.

Our server, Marliena, earns 5 stars.  She was attentive, cheerful, and a perfect example of what a server should be.  Kudos!

Drinks:  After reviewing the wine list, we decided that nothing on the menu was worth $45+ per bottle, so we opted for standard cocktails.  We were served an incredibly average Maker's Manhattan, and a very poor Maker's Old Fashioned.  Something about it was off that I just couldn't place. Marliena insisted on having it remade, and while it came back better than the first time, it was still not good.

Our appetizers, the crab cakes and dates, were good, although the sauces seemed off.  I almost felt like the chef put them on the wrong plates, because the sauce with the dates probably would have gone better with the crab cakes.  That said, the flavors were very tasty.  One negative here:  the crab cakes were certainly not jumbo lump crab, they were more like small, shredded crab bits.

For entrees, we opted for the Kobe Beef Short Ribs and the Lobster Mac & Cheese.  A solid 4 stars here.  These meals were full of flavor, texture, and style.  

Overall, our experience was good....like the description, \"A-OK\".  For a $104 tab with only 2 drinks, I expect the experience to be very good, and while the food itself was good, it didn't blow me away.

Other tidbits. If you can, ask for a table out of the direct light of the overhead track lights.  Our table was almost blinding, which detracted from the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch before a hornets game, the space was nice and the view was great! The staff was all very friendly. The restaurant was basically empty when we got there, yet the crammed us into tables that all touched. I understand keeping people central for servers but this seemed a little much to be bumping people behind you when there was clearly space in the area to sit people with more room. The real let down was the actual food, as we were ordering the people next to us were complaining about their meals, we didn't think too much of it and ordered the cheddar biscuits- which were very good! (at least to me a Boston Native who hasn't had her share of biscuits yet!) Then our meals came, I got the BAE- which was disappointing, it was a breakfast sandwich I could have made at home and a mediocre one at that. The sandwich also said it had cheese on it which mine didn't so it was basically eggs in-between store bought bread with a slice of avocado. My Fiances meal- the Eggs Benedict Carbonara, was okay but nothing to write home about. I would try this restaurant again but not for a meal, the bar area seems great and would more then likely come in to enjoy the few and a few drinks on a nicer night on their patio."}
{"text":"Did the healthy thing walking on the greenway in uptown. Somehow ended up at Fahrenheit rooftop bar!!!  Good way to rehydrate!  

Although the outside area doesn't have service this time of year, you can still  bring your drinks outside.  The warm sun, not sure how they manage Mother Nature, but they still have the fire pits burning.  Great place to spend a Sunday afternoon.  Good drinks and service, and really friendly people.  I love this place, and every time we come here, we meet awesome people - small world!!!  Had the Manhattan two ways -- straight up and then on rocks.  Straight up, need to chill the glass before pouring drink, and also make sure to stir in ice to amply chill the drink.  Overall pretty good drink."}
{"text":"Extremely rude waitress. Do not go if you are alone. They will treat you poorly, rolling eyes and all. The manager was nice but basically just blamed it on her RBF. Unfortunate, because it's a neat location."}
{"text":"The view is the only good thing about this place. Cocktail was mediocre and cost $15 and service was subpar."}
{"text":"THE place to eat for the most amazing view of the city!!!   This high-rise restaurant is located on the 21st floor of the Hayatt hotel. The view is breathtaking with a glassed patio that wraps around the place.  There are no shortage of places to have a awesome photo taken or even a selfie :-)   I would say to make a reservation if you are really hungry.  The bar and outside patio are first-come, but always full.  

The menu has some great choices for appetizers although the \"Charlotte Nachos\" is a winner every time.  It is humongous and delicious.  Also, I'm not sure what they put in their soda, maybe crack, but is the BEST tasting Pepsi I have ever had.  Their wine options and cocktails are also a must!!  

I enjoyed the fried cauliflower with capers and cheese slices.  So, so good!!!  Seasoned to the point that you forget it isn't meat!  And the Vietnamese spring rolls were FULL of chicken and a slight curry flavor that left me wanting more.  

In the cooler parts if the afternoon, they open the walls up so there is a nice view and open breeze from the outside.  Don't worry if you get cold easily, there are huge glass fire pits outside to keep you toasty.  

This is the happening place to be in Charlotte.  I really enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.

I don't write great reviews, but I hope I can do some type of justice.

I have been here a countless number of times and have never had a bad meal, which I can't say for any other place in the area.

My most recent visit I had the braised beef ravioli with the truffle ricotta reduction, which was outstanding and I also tried the lobster mac'n'cheese which I fell in love with.

The atmosphere at Fahrenheit does just as much for your meal as does the food. Even at is busiest the pace never seems to frantic nor is it too noisy, which I guess can be attributed to the type of crowd it takes in.  The patrons vary in age, but they are all there for one reason, to eat well.

Chef Rocco and his team do a great job."}
{"text":"Been here three times, with various friends and each and every time I was totally blown away. Whenever you are able to go somewhere and see the amount of passion for the food being made, you know you will love it. Chef Rocco has a great vision for his menu and it was very well prepared.  

The restaurant has an open concept kitchen with a Triangle-shaped bar that diners fill up according to their reservation time or just simply dine at. You can also be served around the bar by cocktail waitresses if you prefer that not so formal atmosphere, or have a reservation and get an intimate table away from the bar with a great view of Charlotte. You are more than likely going to meet fellow foodies here since this is definitely more of a social type restaurant with the large patio along the backside of the entire restaurant.

Bartenders at Fahrenheit are very knowledgeable and if you are lucky enough to get Tiffany as your bartender keep her! She is on point with her mixed drinks and her ability to get you that perfect drink to accent the meal you are about to enjoy. 

Fahrenheit is definitely a great new addition to Charlotte and I plan on spending many more nights at this new hot spot."}
{"text":"Took a business group on Monday night this week, food was very good, service was totally chaotic. It seems they can't get a grip on this aspect yet. Servers were not very well trained. Oh well, the view is spectacular."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Try the kobe beef ribs. The chef at this place makes some unbelievable dishes. He will go out of his way to come out of the kitchen and explain them to you. If you are in the Tremont area, try this place out. Thats if its not too packed."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times, only for happy hour. I can't comment on the fancy food. I can't really afford it either. The happy hour menu is good. I have tried the burger a couple times and enjoyed it. It is $5 and comes with herbed goat cheese and sweet pickles. The beef tastes fresh. I also had the pizza for $6 which I did not really like. They give you popcorn that is covered in truffle oil I guess. It tastes good. The wine is $4 and beer is $3. The beer selection is Goose Island and Great Lakes during happy hour. The service has been great both times and the bartenders are very personable and friendly."}
{"text":"You're really paying for the view, which in a lot of ways is worth it. Best time to go is at dusk for drinks with friends."}
{"text":"We liked this bar on the rooftop of the Hyatt Place Charlotte Downtown hotel.  It has two nice fire pits outside, which were perfect on a chilly night.  It's kind of a small bar, but was still the highlight of Charlotte for us, plus it was chill and convenient."}
{"text":"Brunch. I was blown away by my entree. 

The Fried Chicken Benedict was not only a unique take on Egg's Benedict, but the flavor profile was multi-faceted. 

The Benedict was a large serving of food. It came in a deep bowl with a solo, large cheddar biscuit as the base. On top of this was a pineapple and papaya marmalade topped with four to five pieces of tender fried chicken. Two poached eggs and a small salad topped the dish. The sweet notes of the marmalade perfectly balanced out the more savory and spiced notes of the biscuit and the chicken's breading. 

There were also two specials that were not on the menu. There was a five-egg omelette and a Bananas Foster French Toast which sounded amazing. 

For starters we got the $6 sticky bun. The order came with two large sticky buns which were enough for 2-4 people. 

While the menu was small, they definitely do it well. I will happily be back."}
{"text":"Welcome to another \"Hype of Charlotte!\" Here is the \"chronicle\" of the night:

It's my good friend's birthday coming up and he wanted to get dinner here. I went online, made a reservation for 8:15pm last night. I also browsed their menu online, thus I know this is a pretty pricey joint. The funny thing to me is that their seafood entrees are better priced than their meat entrees ($20s vs $30-40s). I don't have problem with the price for as long as the food and service are up to par.

I guess the night was doomed before it even began. I called ahead trying to make sure I know where to park. No answer. Well, I know my way around uptown fairly well, so I figured it should be pretty easy to spot the parking garage. So this forever-been-abandoned-building-formerly-known-as-The-Park does NOT have a public garage that I could see. I drove around that block of Caldwell @ 3rd/4th Street 2.5 times and it's simply baffling how to get in there. I ended up parking on the street at the meter (which is free after 6pm during the week). AND the main entrance to the building faces in away from the main street (Caldwell) next to a gravel parking lot. It's the most bizarre setup just to get into the place.

Once I walked through the sliding door to the building (which is also partly a hotel), I saw 2 valets sitting on their behinds. Well, I guess that may have explained the parking fiasco... they probably should have been outside by the door so at least we had a valet option. It wasn't even cold. Then we got \"ordered\" to use the elevator on the right by the door lady because the elevators weren't clearly marked.

22 floors upward later, we walked into Fahrenheit. Looking into the bar area, I could see the appeal. There were big windows/doors opened up to the balcony area, the breeze was coming in to the bar. The lights of the beautiful city skyline in front of it. BUT it's nothing a nice hotel in a bigger city where it's typical to have a roof top bar couldn't offer. So this is the 1st establishment in Charlotte that offers it... it just details how behind Charlotte can be (as much as I love my adopted hometown).

Hostess apparently was in crisis mode with another patron who placed a to-go order. From the sound of it, this lady placed an order over an hour ago, and the food still wasn't ready. She must be staying at the hotel, because she said she was tired and she just wanted food and if it's not already cooked, she's fine not eating at this point. YIKE! Not a good sign... shouldn't a situation like this be handled professionally AWAY from the front door by a manager???? 

We got seated promptly, to the left of the entrance, in a side dining area. We walked by several big tables (6+ top). We ended up at a  2-top table in between two big parties. I felt very squeezed in. And by gosh, there was no air circulation. For those who know me personally, you know I am NOT a high maintenance person. But no one should feel uncomfortable in any restauarant, let alone a high end establishment. And NO ONE greeted us. There was no water. Nothing, nada.

By now my friend and I just looked at each other and contemplating leaving. The waiter who was busy handling one of the big tables next to us finally turned to us and acknowledged the fact that we were there. At this point we decided to move ourselves to the bar area. I stopped by the hostess station to inform her of our move. She smiled and said that's ok. 

Well, call me crazy, but shouldn't that be a hint that something went wrong? In that case, shouldn't a manager be informed that guests just moved themselves to the bar for unknown reasons? And thus shouldn't a manager stop by to at least inquire and pretend it mattered?? Instead we got a visit from a waitress. She asked if we didn't get any service, which we said yes. She then said she was afraid that was the case because she saw us and she was about to come over to take care of us. I don't know if it was a case of concern, or a case of table section turf war.

The bartender was... present. That's the best description I could muster. He was there, but he wasn't friendly or attentive. He got us our drinks, took our food order and efficient. 

Food... finally we got to the food. At this point we didn't know if ordering food was a good idea. We talked about going to another place for dinner. But we ended up order the lobster sandwiches ($13) and spring rolls ($9). Food arrived in RECORD TIME. I meant, we ordered, food came. It felt more like the food was already done and we just happened to order it. Food was ok at best. There were 2-3 small pieces of lobster meat on each of the 3 sliders. The minced chicken in the spring rolls were a little dry. 

4 drinks (3 Jim Beam & Coke = $28.50 and 1 Chenin Blanc $8) and 2 small plates set me back $73. It was the worst $73 I spent. 

Words of advise: just because it's new, has pretty view, has a chef's name attached to it does NOT make it a great restaurant automatically.They have much works to do."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review on our second visit to Fahrenheit, and I will say that from our first visit in 2014 to our second visit in 2017, I was not any more impressed. I gave this restaurant 3 stars, and 2 of them are for the  view.  

We came here primarily for the city view, which is undeniably gorgeous. If you get the privilege of seeing the sunset up on the 21st floor, you'll really enjoy it. However, that's where the impressiveness of Fahrenheit stops. 

My biggest complaint is that this restaurant is strikingly overpriced. We came to celebrate a few family occasions with family from out of town, and we knew that it was expensive but opted for some cheaper options and shared pizza. The pizza easily feeds two people and the flavors were great (I recommend Mr. Fungi), but at $23 a pie, it's so not worth it. We also got jerk chicken wings, which were beautifully seasoned, but again, $14 for 6 wings? No thanks. I can say the same for the desserts (Fahrenheit candy bar is delightful), but still too much. The only menu item I did not enjoy was my mojito. Granted, the manager did ask me if it was to my liking, and I told him it was fine, but it was really the most average mojito and I would never get one there again. 

My husband and I were frustrated that 3 years ago, the valet parking was free, and now they add $10 to your bill. We would have no problem with this if the menu wasn't already beyond overpriced. 

So I gave this place only 3 stars because, while the food is nicely prepared, I could get nicely prepared food elsewhere for half the cost. And the drinks were not good enough to just come back for drinks and the view. We probably won't visit again--we just did not feel it was worth it. 

TLDR: Good-but-not-amazing food, but overpriced and not worth it. Don't get a mojito."}
{"text":"Always a favorite and a great time! Sometimes the food isn't as good as the menu makes it out to be or the presentation is, but always a solid dinner. 

Short ribs are great, steak can be tough. Stick to a steakhouse"}
{"text":"All around a very, very nice dining experience!  We have dined at Fahrenheit twice now and no complaints.  Staff was great!  Our waiter, Zach, was very, very pleasant!  Food both times was delicious!  Great menu and presentation was impressive!  AND, of course, the VIEW!!  What a sunset!  Fun to order a bunch of appetizers!  All were great!  Would probably skip what they call \"Nachos\" next time.  Plate full of fried potato slices (chips) with cheese sauce drizzled over it.  Just too much.  Save your appetite for all the other delicious menu items!  Get a seat by the window if possible.  The bar is great too!  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Hey, come here if you want to be completely ignored and never served. I am wondering why I am staying at this hotel. Never again! I am now forced to go to the Burger King."}
{"text":"The view is amazing. Our waiter was very attentive and he moved quickly. With a large party (12ish people) that's hard to come by. We were seated promptly. We had drinks, and a few appetizers I didn't try. For my meal I had the short rib. It was very tender and good, and the sauce/lo mein was wayyyyy too salty. I would visit again, but for drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"So sad that on a Wednesday night, when the bar seems busy, they close at 11pm! I mean, I get it, you gotta close earlier on the weekdays... but I just wanna enjoy my late night drink! 

We were the jerks who came in at around 5 minutes to 11pm, but they were kind enough to serve us and let us chill outside to enjoy the beautiful downtown view. Not only do you get that beautiful view, but it's really a pretty patio too. With a modern chic fire burning and outdoor seating to cozy up on. 

My Aviation was perfection too. Only wish I had time to get another one!"}
{"text":"Food:

We had shaved brussel sprouts for our appetizer. It was refreshing and tasty. Crispiness from brussel sprouts and savoriness from pancetta pieces and cheese were well balanced with roasted apple vinegrette. It was lukewarm, but would have been better if served cold. 

For entrees, we had kobe beef and 18 hour pork shank. Kobe beef and noodles were too salty, but otherwise, it would have been delicious. 

18 hour pork shank: pork was not like fall-off-the-bone type. I would describe the texture as baked chicken thigh. But, honey mascarpone polenta was amazing. It was overall a good dish.  

Overall, foods were good, but not mind blowing. Also, the portions were small for the price.

Atmosphere:

Clean and modern. Not too formal

Service:

Good

Would I come again?

Maybe. To try different dishes."}
{"text":"Such great food and atmosphere! My boyfriend and I decided to come here for restaurant week however after we sat down we were informed that they end theirs earlier than other restaurants. However, we sat down anyways and what a great decision that was! 

We started with the crispy calamari salad drizzled in Thai sauce (delicious), and then I had the filet mignon and he had the pork tenderloin for entrees. They were both very tender and the pairings of sauces and sides on the dish presentation were perfect compliments! 

All said and done the bill was high, but also because we were drinking. The meal was worth the price point and we will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Called to make reservations on a Friday night at 7:15pm for 8:00. Arrived on time and got sat immediately. However, the server got triple sat and took about 10-15 minutes to take our order. We ordered the Cleveland Nacho for an appetizer which was fair (in terms of size) for the price, but not much to it. I ordered the Kobe beef short ribs which were phenomenal. My boyfriend ordered the grilled salmon which was also good. Overall had a great experience sitting outside on their patio and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lord have mercy, I love this place.

I went for the first time back in the spring and was impressed right away. I had the rack of lamb and it was ridiculously fresh, delicious...just perfect. The views are amazing and I must admit, even impressed a native NYer like me. Their wait staff was on point and everything, from start to finish, was amazing. 

Went back with a group for my friends 40th and had a great time again. Quick service (but not too quick), great food, great drinks and great recommendations by our server. 

I look forward to going here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here for the first time last evening. We were welcomed by a friendly and apologetic hostess because our table was not yet ready. No problem!  We were early for our reservations anyway and we only had to wait about 5 minutes.  After being seated we were quickly greeted by our server Henry, who promptly fulfilled our martini order.  I had already pretty much settled on what I wanted to order before we got there. (I'm always checking out menus online.)  However, he told us of the venison special which sounded intriguing!  We ordered appetizers and mulled over what to choose for our main course.  My husband started with the chorizo stuffed sweet dates, which were wrapped in bacon over a roasted tomato aioli and petite greens.  They had a perfect balance of sweet, spicy., and smokey.  I opted for the Rare Roasted Beef Carpaccio: Sliced Strip Steak, Greens, Miso Vinaigrette, Mango, Apple Syrup & Horseradish.  (I just copied and pasted that one right off the menu!)  All I can say is WOW!  The beef was rare and tender and came wrapped around the greens. The mango and the apple syrup offered a hint of sweetness and the horseradish wasn't overpowering.  Four of these rolled packages of deliciousness come in the order.  Next time I think we'll just split an order of these and forgo the dates as our appetizer. (Don't get me wrong.  The dates were awesome!  It's just that the beef carpaccio was a more filling choice!)  Time for the main course!  We both chose the venison special at Henry's suggestion.  I'm SO glad we listened to him!  We enjoyed a hearty serving of thick-sliced venison in a reduction (Red wine? Cognac?) over a chestnut puree and topped with root vegetables.  I have never before enjoyed such flavorful, moist, and tender venison!  It was a perfect Autumn \"Stick-To-Your-Ribs\" dinner!  The portions for both the appetizer and the main course were generous.  I was stuffed!  Henry offered dessert and I opted for a glass of port.  (My standard \"dessert\"!)  He offered to choose one for me.  Since he didn't steer me wrong on the main course I accepted!  My only stipulation was that it was tawny and \"Not too old, if you know what I mean\"!  (I'm not a Rockefeller!)  He asked if a 10-year old would be OK.  Perfect!  Our glasses of Port came with a small plate full of fresh plump blueberries, blue cheese, and macadamia nuts!  Delicious and delightful!  
 I cannot come up with a single negative comment about our dining experience at Fahrenheit.  The decor and the atmosphere were warm and inviting.  The noise level was slightly loud but not so much that we couldn't hear each other from across the table. (The furnishings offered a lot of soft textiles to help dampen the noise....couches, curtains, etc....)  The service was incredibly quick and the staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.  
I can't WAIT to return!  I've got my eye on the butter poached Maine lobster Mac & Cheese!"}
{"text":"Great food! Will be a choice of dinner for many Saturday nights to come! Had the Short rib & my husband did the sea scallops.
Would give them 5 only cuz chef ? removed the lava cake from the menu! Kinda Disappointed"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue based on the amount of times I frequent this place. The reason I come back is for the bar and the great rooftop view. Those 2 aspects are a solid A. I love their cocktails and even their bar bites. The Korean pork tacos are incredible. 

The part that leaves me conflicted about Fahrenheit is the restaurant. I suppose you could choose to never eat in the dining section, which would be wise, but I did a couple times. The service in the dining area is brutal. Both times I have dined, I watched my server stand around and just kick it by the kitchen while they BS'd with other staff. I get the delay for cocktails at times, but they took over 20 minutes for a bottle of wine. The food was the same story. 

The bar area and patio are so good, it's worth going here from time to time, but I would recommend avoiding the dining area."}
{"text":"Nothing except the view. Went tonight and it was not worth it at all. As soon as we walked in, we were treated as if we were bothering them to come there.  And after we got seated, we waited over 10 minutes for our server to even introduce himself.. which we quickly ordered drinks and appetizers. (Since we had been waiting). We waited so long for our drinks that our appetizers came out before our drinks.. and two were the wrong drink all together. Our server acted like he was annoyed the whole time and actually walked away twice when in the middle ordering a round of drinks. When the food came out, my husbands filet mignon was extremely over cooked yet our server did not come to check on us until everyone finished their meal. The whole experience was very disappointing as it is clear that they are using their chefs name for the success as that was the first thing the server mentioned when he came to our table..the chef who was not even in the restaurant. 

We were 2 couples and spent over $400.. yet I ate mediocre food and was treated like an annoyance the whole time.  Would never go back. Would much rather go to Mortons or Capital Grille."}
{"text":"I was hesitating to eat here after seeing the 3 Stars. Makes no sense to me or they must have drastically improved their menu and service. We loved it and the view was beyond words beautiful! Order the grilled Avocado appetizer, just delish. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Overall, the food here was decent (entrees better than appetizers), but the service was really awkward and messy.

Starters:
Chorizo Stuffed Sweet Dates - they seem to sell this at 90% of the restaurants in Cleveland. It's kind of a fail safe option...how can you mess up anything bacon wrapped?

Tuna Tataki - This was good. I like the creamy avocado sauce on the bottom. If you're thinking about tuna, definitely go for this one rather than the seared tuna entree, which was not as well put together in terms of flavors.

Steak Tartare Summer Rolls - Didn't like this. The skin of the rolls were way too thick, which made it hard to taste anything inside the actual roll. the steak tartare itself was nothing special either - no flavor and too chewy.

Entrees:
Spicy Chorizo - not a fan of their pizza. The crust was too thick and the toppings didn't create anything special when eaten together. Reminded me of something from pizza hut. SKIP!

Kobe Beef Short Ribs - This dish definitely lived up to the hype. The short ribs were tender and the flavor was great (it was on the sweet side, but I like that). If you're not a fan of sweetness in your dishes though, you may not enjoy this. I also really liked the noodles that came with it. It was a very Asian tasting dish, but I liked it. 

Pan Seared Walleye - Perfectly cooked! It came with two pieces, with perfectly crisped top and a tender bottom. ORDER THIS!

Seared Rare Tuna - wasn't really a fan of this. The fried rice and veggie accompaniments were not good at all. Order the appetizer tuna tataki instead.

Butter-Poached Lobster Macaroni & Cheese - I was not a fan of the presentation or the super big rigatoni's, but the sauce was good (fattily creamy, but delicious). There was also a good amount of fresh tasting lobster pieces in the dish. Over I did enjoy this dish and would order it again, but it could benefit from a different type of noodles.


On to the service....

Our server (Dave?) made awkward jokes while taking orders, did not know the menu (we ordered a pitcher of sangria, and he's like, we don't have that. does the menu say that?) - which, side bar, they did have, but was a pretty crappy sangria. Very sweet and juice tasting with a lot of ice watering it down. He then proceeded to spill food and drink on the table and on us throughout dinner because he was trying to carry too many things at once and failing at it. 

I think on food alone I would say this is a 3.5 to 4, but with the service, I'm not sure I'd come back."}
{"text":"Recently went here for a birthday celebration and was not disappointed. Fahrenheit is a frequent happy hour spot for us and we've had dinner there once before. This time did not disappoint and it actually exceeded our expectations.

Between the three of us we had chicken, pork, and salmon. Every dish was excellent. I especially loved the pork shank. Oh my. I need a moment... hold on... ok. Just relived how good it was, as well as the broccolini and polenta. I also ordered a pear salad which had the only misstep of the evening. It comes with two deep fried goat cheese balls. One was still slightly frozen in the middle. Otherwise, everything was tasty.

The desert was also a winner - a chocolate mousse. They even brought out this humongous sparkler since we were celebrating a birthday. 

I've seen other people give the staff poor reviews on here, but our experience was nothing like that. Every person was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings regarding Fahrenheit. Perfect place for upscale drinks, such as a business happy hour or dinner. As I am still in school, I thought the prices were a bit high but were justified for the ambiance, location and view you get to experience.

It is located in Uptown of Charlotte and is one of the highest floors in the hotel it is attached to. Due to this, it has incredible views of Uptown Charlotte. I only had a drink here (because of the prices) but someday I will go back and have the food, as it looked pretty darn good! I would recommend if you are looking for a fun adventure and willing to spend money."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and was so excited to return while visiting. Nothing remotely sounded good on the menu. Even the paper they printed it on was tacky. I ordered a French 75 and specifically asked if they had a bottle of champagne open to make it. The waitress said yes and then returned with a martini glass full of chilled vodka and some amount of white wine. needless to say we didn't bother to stay for dinner. Miss what this place used to be but I'm not so sentimental that I'm going to subject myself to whatever would have came out of that kitchen."}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend before going to a show, and thought it would be good to experience the view, and food. I fault myself for not doing better research on the place, because it is the embodiment of an overpriced hotel restaurant. Tacky presentation, mediocre food, poor drinks, and attentive yet mediocre service. The menu looked shabby, and the paper (on terrible card stock) trying to sell me on a NYE event was just the start. The server, was very attentive in that awkward sort've way, but did a good job in getting our orders, etc. 

We ordered the Chicken Spring Rolls and Mussels first, and both were sort've blah. The red sauce the mussels came in was bizarre, and a poor attempt at being different from your standard white whine sauce. The Spring Rolls came out on a bizarre triangular piece of paper, which seemed incredibly desperate in an attempt to be creative. For our entrees we had the Ribeye and Sea Bass. The Ribeye came out overcooked (Med/Well+), and I had to send it back since you would expect a $45 steak come out the way you ordered (Med/Rare). They did give a bowl of soup to make up for the steak, which was probably the best thing we ate all night. 

The drinks were light on the liquor, and far to sweet or watered down for our liking. 

Overall we don't plan on going back here, and this place has alot of room for improvement."}
{"text":"This is a sort of a hipster place in Tremont.  I have been here before, but I have never noticed the decor. Usually, I end up eating on the patio. Tonight's dining was indoors. The decor had some beautiful features, silver tiled ceiling, frosted glass features, etched glass doors, and modern lighting. It is very well put together. 

A second feature I immediately noticed was the comfort of the dining chairs. I usually cannot find a comfortable seat in a restaurant, these are unusual in that they feel like they have lumber support! This is precious.  The lighting on the other hand could be better. I loathe when I can't see what I am eating. 

Our service was very good. Our server was very into his job. He was very detailed and explained almost every dish. It was refreshing to se someone who is excited about their job. 

The food is tasty, but it is difficult to find a healthy dish here. They serve up American fare, like pizzas, lobster macaroni, and brisket. On request you could order off their vegan menu. I thought that was a nice idea on their part. 
Overall, it's a nice place to dine, good for couples or groups."}
{"text":"Amazing 21 day old t bone steak!! Not to mention the service was amazing!!! Trish and Ary were super attentive and were always making sure we were ok or needed anything.  Will be back as the atmosphere and food were out of this world!"}
{"text":"This review is only the bar and valet service. Love this place, the food and cucumber martini were awesome!! The price for valet is worth paying just for the view alone, the beautiful fireplaces and vibe of the bar service is top notch. Would love to go back for all seasons and maybe try dinner, U must have a reservation. The food, flavor, atmosphere was very pleasing, presentation of the food was Excellent. Offering something for the whole family. My husband and I enjoyed our meal. The shop was both clean and tidy, having plenty seating. The hostess/ waitress was attentive at all times. Staff members there greeted us in/ out when we left. The food was more than filling, loved all the dishes thus far. We will certainly be returning soon and would recommend this facility. Im sure everything is a must try! Great service...I will B returning soon!!"}
{"text":"Great food and tasty drinks! My fiancé and I came here for our anniversary dinner- I had the lobster Mac & cheese, he had seared tuna and we got the bacon wrapped figs for our appetizer.

First of all, bacon wrapped anything is a gift from God himself, and these dates were the perfect testament to that. The crispness of the bacon countered by the creamy, sweetness of the figs literally caused a mouth-gasm. Only my second in life, so bravo.

The lobster Mac and cheese was very rich and the lobster was cooked perfectly. Even though it wasn't a large portion, I still had to take some home because the dish was so decadent.

Hubby enjoyed his seared tuna dish, but thought that the fried noodles were too much to navigate around. 

We'll definitely be coming back for another go-round of Chef Rocco's tasty selections."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for a friends birthday and went to Fahrenheit for dinner. I want the one to make the reservation but apparently it's pretty tough and had to be booked several weeks in advance... We were running a little late and our Uber was too! We called to let them know and they informed us if we were not there by 10 min after our reservation time, our table would be given up. We ended up driving our own car to get there in time and had to park in the adjacent parking lot which costs around $10. The waitstaff was very nice and even though they were very busy, we got drinks and starters very quickly.  We pretty much ordered every appetizer to share between the 5 of us. The highlights were: wood grilled avocado (everyone's fav!), chicken spring rolls, chorizo dates, and tempura rock shrimp. The calamari and ahi poke nachos were also great! They have a pretty good cocktail menu too with unique flavor combos I haven't seen before. If I'd have had room I would've had one of the sweet ones for dessert! When the checks came we just split everything (plus what we had to drink) and were all amazed that it was between $15-25 per person. We literally tried everything!! Best of all the view was amazing. It's on the 22nd floor with the gorgeous \"Queen City\" in the background. Made for an excellent photo to remember the night. Great spot for an occasion or romantic date night. I'd love to come back for brunch the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went to Fahrenheit for the first time, in style for V-day. Opted out of the tasting menu and just ordered a filet with some mussels to start and of course several glasses of Malbec. It was a busy holiday night, so Im not going to respond to the service, Our sever did the best he could. Mussels were excellent tossed in wine and tomato sauce, very tasty! I almost always order a ribeye any where i go. For some reason i decided to order a rare filet, I honestly forgot how good of a piece of meat a filet it! i was delicious, literally melted in my mounted. the truffle demi is an amazing touch to this cut. I was a little sad to hear that they didn't serve any other sauces along side their cuts, I really wanted some bordelaise, after inquiring our server mentioned that the kitchen was too small to make more sauces. regardless, we really enjoyed our experience there. seating could have been better, given the holiday, we got sat in the back bar area, that they turned in to seating, really made the night feel less special...unfortunately."}
{"text":"Came on a random early dinner/happy hour date. We weren't super dressed up but aren't slobs. We were pretty casual-cute and charming to be honest ?... I felt like we weren't treated with great service. The food was not memorable except for the dessert options. I'm not sure I'd like to return."}
{"text":"Brunch menu: YOU HAVE TO TRY THE FRIED BISCUIT DOUGHNUTS. They are bathing suit seasons worst nightmare and your mouths best friend.

Drinks: Overpriced. 

View: One of the best in town. Even if you just go and grab a $5 Bud Light, you have to experience this view at some point. It is a great place to take guests!"}
{"text":"This place is always hopping! The food has always been wonderful. The spring rolls, meatballs, and short ribs are my absolute favorites. Staff has always been friendly and the space is very nice. Great place to go for happy hour as well."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 5:30 on a Saturday night for my FILs birthday. It was the first nice day of the year so Tremont was really hopping, and I was so glad they had valet for $5. 

We were a party of 6 and were seated in a relatively busy area, but it still was a nice table. A bit loud at times, but that's not really a problem. 
We started with a Riesling from Germany - I cannot remember the name, but it was very good. So good we ended up ordering a few bottles of it throughout the evening. 

For apps, we started with the Cleveland Nachos - Yum. The spring rolls were also really interesting combination of flavors. But the real standout we tried for apps was the rock shrimp with the siracha sauce. The coating on the shrimp was perfect, not too heavy and full of flavor. I could eat those by the pound I think. 

For dinner I had the seared tuna. It was good. Peppered crust came with the best rice I'v ever had in my entire life. I don't know what the spice bled was on that rice, but wow. 
My husband had the beef short ribs. While my entree was good, his was spectacular. The beef was so tender and the flavors in the sauce with the lo mein noodles was really perfect. 

The service was great and I think the meal was paced very well. Although the meal was a bit pricey, I would totally come back as I want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I really love going to Fahrenheit for cocktails in the late afternoon when the weather is nice. We usually go early around four in the afternoon and grab a seat outside on the patio with an awesome view of Charlotte. I have to mention a server that we really enjoy having named Alexis. She has waited on us several times and is always so attentive, always there when you need her but never pushy, and she is so friendly and lets us go at our own pace, which I really appreciate. We love Fahrenheit and will continue to go,especially for our date nights! We already have plans to return!!"}
{"text":"Aaron did an amazing job serving our party of 6 during the busy Queen's Feast Week, a dining out celebration where select restaurants in the Charlotte area offer an abbreviated menu for a reasonable price ($35). This gives patrons the opportunity to try several dishes on the restaurant's menu, spend less than normal on the usual 3 course meal and creates business buzz for participating restaurants.

Fahrenheit was a no-brainier once I went to check the venue and saw its amazing rooftop view of Uptown Charlotte. It's located on the 21st floor and gives an amazing skyline picturesque scenery of the city. There is also a gorgeous fire pit for those taking a glimpse in the cooler evening hours. 

On to dinner: the salmon was delicious, prepared medium just as I requested. The chocolate mouse dessert was decent and the avocado appetizer was tasty enough to get the palette going but nothing to write home about; personally I felt the bread was a bit overbearing and would've been better served on a thin crostini instead. 

I particularly enjoyed the ambiance of Fahrenheit more than anything else. Linen napkins, dim lighting, tea light centerpieces, an intimate full bar area with plush lounge seating and secluded booths for couples. My experience was memorable and I'd certainly recommend Fahrenheit for date night, girls night out, happy hour or just celebrating a special occasion.

{"text":"Scallops were very well cooked, and very flavorful.  Pad Thai Dish could use a little more spice, but would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times. Each time I eat here, I absolutely love the amazing view and the food. All the food here is ridiculously good. The only thing that could be improved on (which seems to be a common complaint) is the service. I have had nice servers, but the kitchen had lost our ticket and the server forgot what we ordered. One time, I got up with food still on the table, and I went outside for a few minutes to check out the view. When I came back, my table was cleared! Lol. Not a huge deal. They gave us some food to-go on the house which was cool. Just a little bit of improvement with service could make it 5 stars ;) oh and if you go there- definitely get the lobster Mac and cheese. It's to DIE for!! So yummy."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, service is slow even when they aren't busy and the staff can be rude or maybe just not well trained. And the worst part is, I've only been there for brunch. I've heard the dinner food is even worse than breakfast. I've been there a handful of times, sat outside and inside. Been in large groups of people and ate at a table for two. My boyfriend went there today with his friends and their service was so slow they had to call the manager over. 30 minutes for a bowl of cereal to come out and someone that ordered pancakes didn't get their eggs and sausage until 20 minutes AFTER he got his pancakes. Some girl with long brown hair also got an attitude with my boyfriend for making EYE CONTACT with her and very RUDLEY came over to him and said \"do you need something because you're staring at me.\" Like ok, that's what kind of establishment this is. Don't waste your money---the view is NOT worth it. If anything, order some water outside so you can take pictures and then just leave."}
{"text":"They sat the 3 of us in the back in a semi-enclosed area that reverberated the sound and sat us at a table that provided us with the greatest distance away apart from the 3rd. The table was inappropriately sized. This resulted in a complete inability for the 3rd diner to possibly hear or to be heard by the other 2 diners. This was quite uncomfortable and countered the entire point of going out with friends to commiserate by leaving the 3rd diner with the clear feeling of being the 3rd lonesome wheel. 

The bread might be acceptable if you like having your meal start out with an overbearingly sweet flavor, which I do not. 

I ordered the house salad and the short ribs. The house salad was very good and I was pleased with it. The short ribs were stringy, tough and lacking of flavors. It was devoid of seasoning or, better yet, some type of acid. 

I was quite disappointed with our experience this evening and will not be recommending it to others."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is one of my favorites.  Mon-fri 5-7p and never really crowded. Food on happy hour menu is a great value. Most expensive is $7. I had the cheesesteak with truffles cheese wiz. High end meets workin man's sandwich. Also got the fries that had truffled oil and parm. A bit salty for my taste but very good nonetheless.  Had the Duval Belgian to wash it all down. All for under $15. Service excellent as usual. Tremont is still the champ when it comes to restaurants and happy hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last week...it was a warm summer evening (maybe 80 degrees) and unfortunately almost as warm in the restaurant! They attempted to seat us at a little table about a foot from the neighboring table even though we had a reservation....we refused and instead took an available high top table. There was only a single valet (made for a rather long wait) and he did not have any change??? I do have to say the food was nicely prepared and very good; I had a steak and my wife had the lobster mac-n-cheese. The prices are rather high, which is not really a problem for quality food, but a high price restaurant needs to be on top of the whole experience, not just the food.....the AC should work properly, the table locations should be reasonably private and the valet service should match the crowd size and be prepared to offer reasonable change. 3 or 4 stars for the food.....0 to 1 for the experience=my 2 star rating."}
{"text":"The view of the city skyline is 2nd to none. I had the tacos and the ahi tuna nachos. The tacos were okay but the nacho blew me away, probably the best I've ever had. The drinks were good but nothing special"}
{"text":"Who closes on July 4th on a Saturday night!? Nothing else in Charlotte closed for this. You're a rooftop bar on the one night that has fireworks. I gave you three stars for existing but that was so lame and so disappointing for my date and I."}
{"text":"Let's talk about the marvelous view here at Fahrenheit. I felt like i was on a mini vacation for awhile and with the warm weather yesterday was perfect! You get a clear view of Charlotte's sky line condos and high rise buildings downtown, while on the other side of the rooftop you see people sunbathing in bathing suits on the roof. Such a cool upscale concept . My friend has been bragging and boasting so much about the shrimp here so i finally decided to join her for lunch yesterday and try them  out. Everything definitely met my expectations from the ambiance of Fahrenheit, to the food,drinks, and view. The crispy tempura rock shrimp won my vote for presentation, and taste. Our bartender was awesome and very knowledgeable about the drinks and what ingredients were in each. After seeing so many people  ordering the Saturday savior i decided that's what i wanted to order because it must be good the way everyone at the bar was continuously ordering it. It reminded me of a coffee and thin mints unique flavor and milky. One thing i do know is it was very strong because i was feeling some type of way after just one drink which is unusual for me. So im  sure that wins a lot of patrons votes. I also ended up ordering one of their signature custom mules you cant ever go wrong with a mule i feel.First light mule is the one i decided to order. Fahrenheit won be over for my go to summer hang outs this year for appetizers and drinks!  In my Arnold Schwarzenegger voice. \"Ill be back\" !"}
