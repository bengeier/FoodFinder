{"text":"This is a great place to eat vegetarian South Indian food! The dosas we ate were delicious- we had madras masala dosa and the special rava masala dosa. Sambar accompanying the dosa was especially great! This could be a good competition for the other existing South Indian restaurants in the area.   Service is excellent- they were very accommodative to our requests for hot water, modifications to some of the food we wanted and extra plates. And unlike Gurulakshmi, I did not feel rushed to finish my meal.   Only small note: Thalis are only available for lunch- the menu didn't mention that, which would have been nice to know in advance before we came for dinner. Menu should be updated to reflect when food is/ isn't available."}
{"text":"Good quantity, good quality and great price. Lassi was okay. Wish they had dessert options to offer or filter coffee to finish the meal. Washroom is super tiny"}
{"text":"Fun experience here. Food was good - I've never had Sri Lankan food before and I really enjoyed their dosas. I had an eggplant (I think) appetizer that was absolutely insane. The chocolate dosa at the end almost caused a fight at my table - LOL. So good. Totally affordable."}
{"text":"Great selection of South Indian vegetarian food. Home cooked flavours, great prices, excellent weekend buffet. Simple, good value, friendly service."}
{"text":"Got 2 Masala dosas which came very quick but were cold and not crispy. They did replace these with two new crispy dosas but did not listen to our spice request. It was spicy and not that great. Also poor service."}
{"text":"I think they switched owners and the food used to be great.  I and 2 others didnt finish"}
{"text":"Great food. The Indo-Chinese-South Indian fusion is out of the world - Chilly Idli and Chilly Garlic Dosa is a must have for spice lovers.   The batter sold separately also lived upto the expectations."}
{"text":"Been here twice , food is good but the only irritating thing here is u have to pay for coconut chutney if u order idli sambhar . Charging for chutney is insane to customers if u r eating South Indian food.  Restaurant business is all about customer satisfaction which leads to word of mouth marketing . CUSTOMER VOICE IS BUSINESS.  Owner should revise the policy .  Would rate this place above 4 if they more customer oriented .  Good food n superior customer experience makes business prosper !!!"}
{"text":"Our favourite South Indian eat-out in the area. We went to Annalakshmi sometime back based on a friend's recommendation. The place is nice and clean and the servers were good. Of course, the ambience is not comparable to Gurulakshmi but again, we didn't have to reserve or wait in queue. Overall, we were seated nicely and ordered Idli sambhar, Vada Sambhar, Paneer Masala dosa, Onion Tomato uthapam. The food was very very good and delicious. I ordered the Dosa to be crisp and it was spot on. The Paneer Masala filing was also very good. The sambhar had all the right flavours and Idlis were soft and nicely cooked. It's a perfect place to enjoy South Indian flavours and would highly recommend for anyone looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Lunch Buffet!!! Such a surprise! The food tastes very homely and variety of tastes! Simple buffet, but good buffet. Oh, unlimited dosa and puri rotti!!! My new favorite Brampton restaurant."}
{"text":"South Indian is always my fav for freshly made vegetarian dishes! Ordered the rava masala dosa, with a side of idli and vada. Sambhar was a bit thick for my liking, the chutneys were good, so overall all flavours were a good blend. Made the mistake of doing take-out, so the food was a bit soggy by the time I got to it. Best to enjoy in the restaurant. Tons of free parking on site. Reasonable prices and prompt service."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by saying I usually avoid vegetarian Indian food whenever I can because it is something I don't usually enjoy; except for the food served here!  I was introduced to this place by a friend who said nothing but good things about it, admittedly I was a little hesitant at first, but I was glad I went for it. Annalakshmi has a decently sized Dosa menu consisting of different variants of Dosa to appease each pallet. I went for the Madras Dosa which was quite amazing, it had robust flavours and tasted quite spicy! As an accompaniment I had the Onion and Chilli Bajjis which were slightly oily but still tasted good. You also have the option to customize how your Dosa is made (less oil, more oil, extra crispy, etc.). That is something to note if you like your food a certain way.   Service is always great here, the staff always greets you with a smile and are very courteous; something generally not found in smaller ethnic restaurants from my experience.   I would definitely check this place out if you want to get your Dosa craving fixed!"}
{"text":"Ordinary Dosa you can have in town. The experience was not anything over the top. Regular Dosa, decent sambar not the best chutney. Customer service was ok. Only took care of you when you called the server. Servers all stand together around cash area and just wait to be called or cued by kitchen.  If you are looking for the best Dosa experience this is not the place but if you just want a quick Dosa for dinner you can find ordinary Dosa here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food anything you order exceeds expectations!! We come here for aloo parathas  They are super excellent  The chicken sweets anything u order is really amazing  We come here twice a month and go back feeling happy about the food we ve had Papri chaat , chicken samosas everything exceeds expectation"}
{"text":"Highly recommend.  Looks like a relatively new business and it was full! The service was quick and friendly.  The portion of the dosas were much bigger than what I've ever seen.  They had this tipi shaped dosa. Will try next time!!"}
{"text":"Non authentic south indian restaurant! (stop fooling people)  Disorganized staff management and had wait for a lifetime to get a table n be served (after repeatedly calling server to take our order) Only saving grace was the sambar to an extent. Coconut chutney was awful (instead of using freshly grated coconut used powdered coconut) which gave a bad after taste.  Dosa was bad (tasted like readymade batter with loads of soda rather than letting it naturally ferment) and caused indigestion after 30 mins finishing my dinner.   Not going to visit this place again.   NOT RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and pictures, Annalakshmi seemed to have the potential to be as good as Guru Lukshmi, with the pictures on Yelp showing that their dosa's even looked exactly the same (served on a plate with pre-made sections for all the chutney's). I was immediately intrigued to try this place out, since it would be great to have a place to go to when you haven't made reservation at Guru Lukshmi but you are craving for an authentic dosa's really bad. Located in Brampton (surprise, surprise) in a plaza, not very noticeable. We luckily got one of the last tables available in the pretty small restaurant, which probably fits around 10 tables. The servers were very friendly, which was the first thing I noticed. Since my brother is vegan, I was happy to see that they serve a combo consisting of medu vada and dhai idli, but this combo was pretty deceiving, or maybe I just read it wrong because what came was a medu vada and idli both soaked in yogurt, rather than a dhai idli and a separate medu vada. The dhai idli wasn't very good because it was literally a tiny idli drowned in a huge (gigantic, rather) bowl of watery and flavourless yogurt.  For mains I got the mysore masala dosa and my brother got the chilli garlic dosa. I liked that they didn't serve the food within a minute, which is what Guru Luksmi usually does. The dosa's arrived in around 7-10 minutes. I asked for no oil on my dosa, since that was an option, however oil was clearly used. Furthermore, my dosa was pretty bland. I couldn't taste any mysore paste and the masala lacked flavour. I did enjoy their sambar, though! the chilli garlic dosa seemed to be fine, since I didn't hear any complaints. while we were eating a waiting queue had formed, which showed that this place is doing really well.  One thing I did appreciate was that when another customer asked to sit at our table while waiting for his own table, the sever kindly gave him a seat somewhere on the side and explained that we should get our privacy when eating. Overall, I think this place has potential and that I just ordered wrong. Therefore, I will give this place another shot for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious dosas and uttapams. Good service. Place could be a tiny bit cleaner. Skip the vadas and idlis. Comfortable seating."}
