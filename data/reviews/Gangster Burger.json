{"text":"I was excited, and had high hopes for Gangster Burger. When I went in, it smelled amazing. I ordered my burger and fries, and picked at the fries while I waited. The fries were nice and just made me more excited.  The burger is terrible. There were myriad problems:  1) The beef patty didn't have a high enough fat content, so it just tasted bland. Mix in more fat and you'll have a better patty.  2) It wasn't seasoned at all, so what little flavour the patty did have was washed out. Salt is your friend.  3) The bun was too thick, it was cold, and it was dry and crumbly. Get some freshly baked buns, don't use day-olds, and heat them up. They should be soft and warm and wonderful.  4) The cook kept moving the burger around, so it never developed a proper delicious crust. For shame!  5) The fries are tasty, but whoever is prepping the thyme they use is lazy, because I kept picking sticks out of my mouth. Seriously, prep your food right.  If you're going to call out the best burger in Toronto in your ad copy, have the chops to back it up. As it is, this place is all talk and no taste. The best thing I can say is that they're better than Hero burger, but so is shoe leather served on sandpaper."}
{"text":"Walking by, the smell of beefy meat is quite enticing. Looking in, the shop is a long & narrow take-out only space, with a tiny ledge on the side you could theoretically eat on. It's a short menu and usually I'd get the most basic burger available, but hey, what's this special blue sauce (Lucas burger) about? Well, in for a penny, as they say.  In the back, they have a flat-top and they seem to be making smash-style burgers... but Priest's this is not. The patty is packed solid/thick (which I prefer), but beef-taste isn't strong enough for me - and I get an almost sweet taste from it. I would also like a slightly higher fat ratio in the mix - it just needed the kick of fat and some more salt to bring the flavours out. It did have a nice crust on it, which I appreciated.  Thankfully, the blue sauce isn't as blue as their promo photo. When I asked what was in it, I was told only that it's a \"cheese sauce\" (the rest is secret), but there's a blue(?) cheese (crumbly texture of parm) taste to it. With garlic. Blue cheese aioli or something? Total guess here. Not bad.   But the giant and slightly dry/stale bread totally detracts from the burger. I ditched the buns at the half-way mark.  The fries sounded great, but I found that there was too much garlic salt or something to that effect and no thyme. I really wanted to enjoy these, but I did not.  Overall, the taste is okay and I think they could improve. But these guys aren't operating at the gourmet burger level and I think if they set expectations at a more moderate level, they'd see less vitriol from the masses."}
{"text":"My go to burger joint! Great staff, unique theme, great atmosphere and most importantly, the burgers kick ASS!"}
{"text":"Gangster burger ain't so gangster when it comes down to it. The burgers are ok. 5/10. Meat had no BAM... Texture was a bit too mushy for me. Ok, so if your starving and wanna grab a seat to eat cause you've worked all day, don't go here. There's no seats. Standing space only, and it does get crowded fast. The place is tiny and the prices are expensive. I wouldn't go out of my way to check out this place. But if your walking by the joint, your starving, and don't wanna sit because your so hungry, then stop in and inhale a burger if there's standing room too eat. 6 people fill the place and 3 people can eat at a time on a breakfast bar. Gangster sucks Ass..."}
{"text":"Gangster Burger......what a great name. With such a cool name they should have an awesome burger....so I thought.   Maybe my expectations got the better of me (I love a good burger), but the experience was mediocre. Nothing special about the burger....which makes it not worth the money. Service wasn't great either and you can't really eat inside.  There is too much burger competition for being this mediocre."}
{"text":"Went in with a friend around 230am, ordered the Capone. The place is small and had around 3 people ahead of us waiting for their food... Key word here is WAITING. I understand that it is late at night but they should be expecting some sort of rush after the bars get out if they are going to be open until 4am. They had 2 people working. One girl taking orders (that was it... At one point she came out front to turn off the \"open\" sign... It was 3:25am) and one line guy making burgers. We waited approximately 30 minutes to get two burgers. The burgers themselves were good... But not worth the wait. We inquired about the status of our order a couple times and got a fake nice answer and you could tell the girl was annoyed.   If you have a spare 45 minutes for one burger then come here ... Other than that steer clear."}
{"text":"I heard from my friends that this place is amazing and beats priests burger. I would say the price is better and the burger is a little bigger compared to priests. The only thing I didnt like was that the bun was too big for the patty. If they fix that, they wont have a problem beating priest burger."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago after hearing the hype. Staff were super cool, and the concept is pretty rad, but here's my beef with the place, they're calling out their competition but have inferior burgers. \"No heros, no priests, just gangsters.\" Really? Gangster Burger might kick Hero Burger's ass, but I think it's a matter of fact, not opinion, that The Burger's Priest's proprietary beef grind actually tastes miles better than what these guys have. Give me a blind taste test I'll be able to tell them apart easily because the difference in taste is that drastic. I'm not saying their burgers are bad (their not as good as people are saying either), but if you're looking to take swings at your competition, make sure you can knock them the fuck out. It seems like they're trying to over compensate what flavours the food may be lacking by heavily topping their beef (which should be the star of the burger), over seasoning the fries (too much thyme dudes), and adding a little controversy in the mix. I respect these young dudes for doing what they want, but they really need to re-think their plan of attack, no matter how much attention a Drake co-sign will get you.  \"You don't get in the ring with Ali 'cause you think you box.\"  NB: If they do in fact use Kobe beef for their burgers, they're doing it wrong. Gangster Burger dudes, let me let you in on a secret that's not so secret if you're in the business of burgers. Ground chuck. 80/20 ratio. Form into a ball of your preferred weight. DO NOT OVER HANDLE. Place on hot flat top and smash the ball flat after a minute. DO NOT TOUCH THE BEEF AT THIS POINT. Season. When the bottom crusts up, flip. Season. Add cheese. Cook until medium or until cheese is melted. Now go back to trying to smash your competition.  If this was the drug game in the streets, The Priest gang would've sent them shooters to the storefront by now."}
{"text":"Ordered the mushroom burger. As a vegan I have eaten many a mushroom burger in my time, and this was super super weak, especially since I forked over $9 for it. Even at $5 I would have been a little disappointed (though not surprised). Only went here because my go-to place was closed and I was hungry and felt like taking a risk.   These people do not know how to marinate or season a mushroom, apparently. Bland as all get-out, barely any flavour to whatever teeny tiny amount of sauce they put on this thing. I walked five minutes from Gangster Burger to my house and when I opened up the wrapping the bun was literally completely soaked, soggy as fuck, and dripping all over the place. No one likes a soggy burger! What the hell you guys, for $9 I would expect way more. Learn to not totally suck please, thanks!  If nothing else is open, meh I guess the food is somewhat edible, but it would definitely be one of my last choices in the area. I would rather go to the Loblaws next door and buy some hummus and crackers. Seriously.  There are also no chairs to sit and eat here despite there being a counter? Uh?"}
{"text":"I like the concept however I was expecting much more. I had the burger with the mac and cheese.  Overall it was good but it was just missing something key to give it that kick I was looking for. the staff was friendly and explained the menu to us as they should. cleanliness is my only concern it wasn't filthy but it sure needed more regular cleaning"}
{"text":"Only went here because pizza was closed.  Let's be honest - the only reason why you would come here is because it's called gangster.  It's way overpriced for what you get"}
{"text":"Good burger, for downtown. Also, it's open Sundays which makes it even better given the possible hangover. It's a smash burger but you'll only need one paddy because of the uncharacteristic thickness given its a smash. I had the Dillinger, which was pretty good-however I did need to add extra pickles. All in all, at 3am on a Saturday morning or at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon it's a good call. Get the chipotle mayo!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Dillinger with a side of fries and grabbed a Diet Coke.  I'm not fond of thyme - reminds me of hospital meatloaf.  That is not Ganger's fault, of course.  But I think the fries should be less spiced as it competes with the hamburger, and when there's too rich a flavour, you can't finish them.  I DID NOT FINISH THE FRIES.  This never happens.    Also, the fries were slightly mealy.  I don't mind less crispy fries (as mentioned by other reviewers) but they better be good, and I should at least WANT to finish 'em!  The hamburger was okay.  Honestly, I prefer Hero Burgers.  I like the atmosphere, the friendly staff, and the gangster trivia running on the screen above the counter (how $2400 was spent by some ganster on just the rubber bands to keep blocks of cash together).  But the food just wasn't enough to bring me back.    I eagerly await the opening of Burger Priest a block east."}
{"text":"This is totally weak and wont last too long.. .Few major points:  1) Terrible marketing IMO. The whole gangster feel is clearly targetting a particular market (think thug life), despite the italienesque feel.. Its not impressive either to see the owner speeding down queen in blasting horrible rap music blowing up my ears from a distance of 2 blocks... truly makes me want to support your business sir..  2) The restaurant needs better ventilation, the smoke is so thicky and greasy, its very difficult to breath and you can almost wipe the grease off your skin after standing there for less than 2 minutes..  3) very poorly seasoned burger, with low fat content, making it not juicy. Buns were very low quality, and the fries barely held it together..not enough substance.. id prefer half the amount of REAL QUALITY fries as opposed to that mountain of starch.  4) this deserves a point on its own, burgers need to be seared properly.. please research the maillard reaction for your own benefit.  5) customer service , could be be better..  I realize this review is a bit harsh, but i had high hopes for this place, fantastic location and all. too bad they did not deliver."}
{"text":"I don't know if I've ever felt this way about a burger before. Other then the fact there's no seating (take out only) this is the best burger spot I've ever been to. I really enjoy the fact that the toppings aren't your regular options; the dill havarti cheese and sautéed onions are delicious and the burger that comes with Mac and cheese is to die for. The burgers themselves are freshly made and thick enough to leave you struggling on the first bite. You won't leave hungry. Best burgers. Even talking about them makes me want one."}
{"text":"I walked in because I was curious about the theme and I think the decor is great, as is the overall conceit. The staff are lovely, too, but the burger left a lot to be desired, especially at the ten-dollar price point ):. I tried the El Chapo, but as freshly made as the meat might've been, the salt and banana peppers overpowered the taste, to the point that I had to search for the beef, guacamole, etc. I would probably have been better off if I'd ordered salt-encrusted hot peppers because then I wouldn't have been disappointed. If the El Chapo had had even one redeeming quality, I'd give Gangster Burger another chance, but I'm afraid it's lights out. /obligatory ganster reference"}
{"text":"i figured a new burger joint priced similarly as any other in town would be worth checking out to ease the hunger pains pre-grocery shopping. plus the concept was fun, what with \"bosses\" and \"side hustlas\" haha.   the narrow space gets crowded easily and the greasy smoke convinces you to wait for your order outside :(  we got the CAPONE and the DILLINGER. unfortunately we quickly forgot which had what toppings and couldn't decipher the two, aside from some bacon remnants. the buns were adequately sized to accommodate the hefty patties. too bad the patties were way overcooked (not sure if it was a sign of being overly cautious on questionable meat, or careless cooking) and they were skimpy on the sauce (more gangster goo, please!)  their skinny fries could have had more intense thyme flavour and pricing most def could have eased up considering the portion size.  E for Effort."}
{"text":"Very small place with maybe 3 bar stool.  Burgers were decent in size and well cooked beef patties.  Staff was friendly and explained the burgers.  Place is rocking so loud music as well."}
{"text":"Stand up deal. (No seats, just a small bar.) Some seriously good hip hop being served here! There are some really interesting pics of people eating their burger out on the street in front of the shop because there isn't much room inside. They are using their car hoods for a table and the cars are photogenic too - very nice! When we were discussing what one says when asked, 'How's everything?' by a server, I wrote this: When I'm having a foodgasm, moaning and nomming to myself, eyes half shut, my mouth full and all I can manage is a half baked smile and a nod. When asked 'how's your burger' at Gangster Burger last weekend, I told the cook what I thought. Smoky BBQ sauce, crunchy big chunks of caramelized onion, nicely salted patty with delicious bacon and cheddar... and much better than my recent burger at 5 guys recently...  he gave me an understanding nod in return :)"}
{"text":"Awesome exposed brick wall, gangster collage wallpaper, banging modern \"gangster\" music.   The burger was extra fresh, made right in front of us, and they were friendly to offer non-spicy alternatives for the weaker of us.   A special note on this place is the blue magic sauce.  Tried it with the fries... amazing They said it was a mix of mayo, parmesan, and a bit of honey... What makes it blue?...   Only gripe about this place is the seating.  Two seats at what should be a 4 seat bar But that's it!  Better prepare to take out if it's full!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise on the Queen West stretch between Bathurst and Spadina.  The Capone burger seemed to have a bit of everything.  The meat was moist but could have used a bit more salt.  The bread was soft and the toppings were fresh.  I liked the fact the burger was not dripping with grease.  Once this place gets into a rhythm of cooking and expediting, I think they will have a solid following.  Thanks for cutting my burger in half so I could share with my hubby!  :)  We will go back for another burger (and fries) soon."}
{"text":"These burgers are the lick!  The wife and I shared a pretty boy Floyd and Dillinger with a side of fries and blue ice dipping sauce. Honestly I need to bring a franchise to my neck of the woods cause this puts my local burger joints to shame.  Well seasoned burger and fries.  A bit greasy but real juicy.  This shits da bomb!"}
{"text":"So I used this year's burger week as an excuse to finally try this place and I'm really glad I did!  The \"KBH\" is a real spicey treat and was obviously well made, if only because at no point did the burger threaten to come apart (despite being pleasantly greasy with many ingredients) and the egg didn't leak at all, a rarity.  The fries are very nicely spiced, outdone only by the duck fat fries at WVRST imho.  Unfortunately there is no seating and, aside from the park behind the library at Dundas & Bathurst, there's not much in the way of public seating nearby. As there was a rainstorm at the time my pals and I took up the very tiny bit of counter eating space they have, but felt like a bunch of dicks since that space was clearly needed for people still waiting to be served.  Overall, I think it's an okay place with great food for prices that are also great - considering what you're getting. Outside of burger week you'd be looking at about $20 for a burger, fries and drink. Not a budget joint but, like BQM, totally worth splurging on if you have a little extra cash to throw around.   I'll definitely be back to try one of their regular menu items and apparently they announce secret menu items on their Twitter account? Interesting..."}
{"text":"It seems the burger craze hasn't let up even with the demise of the overpriced expansion of Montreal's M:Brgr. A newcomer to Queen West, Gangster Burger is an indie burger shop that sets itself apart from the usual fare by using a unique combination of flavourful toppings and custom-made sauces, the pride and joy being the Blue Magic sauce, for which the owners were reluctant to reveal the recipe for.   These all beef burgers are 6oz in size (4oz for the veggie burger) and the fries are very tasty shoestrings garnished with a salt & pepper seasoning to boost the flavour. There is no seating with the exception of a single shelf along the wall, so consider it a grab 'n' go destination ideal for a quick bite or take-out. The owners are friendly and proud of their creation, so you can feel the love in their cooking. Certainly one of the better burger options in King & Queen West and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Got the Capone with bacon. Great burger tons of toppings and cheese. Also loved the sauce. Was a little pricey seeing it wasn't that filling. I'd recommend getting an extra patty which would come up to around $15 for the burger.  Also no seating just a little counter on one side if you want to stay. If you want to try the best burgers in Toronto make sure you try this place."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I love the theme of this place, since it's quite unique. I saw the sign and instantly knew that the gangster that I am must at least try the gangster burger!   I ordered the Capone, and it took about ten minutes for the preparation. Meanwhile sat inside. There's seating for about 4-5 people at the bar-height wall table.   The burger itself is really filling and has some great toppings on it (I never realized how big a 6 oz. patty really is). Unfortunately the burger patty itself lacked flavour. The toppings were great but couldn't change the fact that, with every bite, I had a huge chunk of beef burger that tasted like nothing, and that dominates the experience. If they could make the patties tastier,  they would really be in competition. Price wise, I paid 12 ish dollars for a burger and water bottle, no sides or anything extra, so I'd say it's a bit on the expensive side.   They think ahead and keep a napkin holder at arms reach along the table, and man was it handy! The burger was messy, but what other way would anyone have it?!   Staff were friendly, and the place was clean. Some great hip hop music was also spinning, and made me want to dance like a gangster.   Cool experience, cool burger ( needs a wee bit of work) , nice staff!   Gangster out."}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to give Gangster Burger a try during the first night of Burger Week as their offering sounded the most interesting, and we weren't disappointed! The place was absolutely packed though and we had to wait about 35 minutes to get our order (I felt so badly for the staff but they were doing their best). But overall, the burgers themselves were stellar and if we're back in the area we'll definitely order off their regular menu. :)"}
{"text":"Bam!  That's a burger!   Don't waste your time with the other burger joints down the street in either direction. Fresh ingredients, decent 6oz hand-formed patties of really flavourful beef & diverse toppings arranged in unique combinations characterize Gangster's burger creations.    I ordered El Chapo, which I hear is part of the Secret Menu, & it was super.   Served on an ample-sized fresh bun it was topped with guac, caramelized jalapenos, bacon, cheddar, spicy ketchup, lettuce & tomato.    I didn't get fries but will have to do so on a subsequent occasion, because they sound like they'd be pretty good.  Please note: * The burger I ordered is the most expensive on the menu & was $9+ incl taxes.   * Their bottled drinks are premium priced, so get your drink elsewhere. * It's a cash only establishment. * There's only a modest ledge along the inside of the restaurant for eating in."}
{"text":"After hearing great things from friends and family I figured I would give Gangster Burger a shot! The \"Pretty Boy Floyd\" (cheddar, chipotle, Mac and Cheese) was great but the spiced fries really made this place! Prices were pretty reasonable and food was great! With that combo you really can't go wrong (get the chipotle dipping sauce for the fries)."}
{"text":"To be honest. I LOVE the idea and the concept. It's also good to be open after 3am. But when you are not busy, and it takes 30 minutes to make a burger...I think you're doing it wrong. Not to mention the burger was just 'meh'. Not very tasty, and the jalapeño were too spicy to even put on a burger...they didn't even taste like jalapeño...which i normally enjoy. Overall way over priced for the quality, the speed, and taste."}
{"text":"Best burger place ever .. I've taken everyone who comes into town to this place and they all loved it hands down! Great quality and amazing flavours for you taste buds... Super yummy! The fries are amazing and my personal favorite is the burger with mac n cheese in it add some bacon and it's the best thing ever... And I love the glass bottle coke :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for new burger places in downtown Toronto and this place appealed to me because of the personality on their website.   I went in and tried the El Chapo. Their menu consists of burgers named after famous gangsters. Because it is a small joint, you get to see the cook make the burger in front of you. While waiting, I took in the surroundings. The restaurant has very solid decor, further accentuating its strong personality.   The burger itself was fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised by the caramelized jalapeños in my burger and added another level of flavour. The other burgers also some have creative ideas on it so make sure to try it before it gets super popular!"}
{"text":"Gave them a second chance because of the lively and great customer service, which is still the case and earns them a single star. However, the burgers are the worst I've ever eaten. They are very, very dry and most of the flavour comes from some seasoning they put ON the meat and whatever toppings you get. I even mentioned to the employee that last time the burger was dry, he had nothing to say about that. The bun still tasted stale and practically disintegrated as I ate my burger. I forgot the burger even came with guacamole on it.  This time they turned down the music so I could order!  The day after I ordered the el Chapo burger, they captured el Chapo. So with that my duty is done and so are my visits to Gangster Burger."}
{"text":"Walked into this small hole in the wall restaurant and was immediately greeted by an amazing smell of beef on a flat top and nice ambiance. The burgers have really cool names and the feel permeates through the whole menu. 1920's gangster through and through. Got a \"pretty boy Floyd\" with jalapeños and bacon, cause what is life without bacon?  All told for two people it was about 35$ and well worth it. The music is playing in the background and there are a few seats on the wall. Coke served from glass bottles and fries cooked just right. Get the blue sauce. I have no idea what it's called but I do know it was tasty and enhanced the flavor.   Chefs and staff are young and friendly and understand the customer experience is very important.  This is key because so often people suck ( yes world being nice to your customers is important, so pay attention).   Would definitely go back to try more   Oh final note. My burger had Mac and cheese on it...need I say more?"}
{"text":"The reason I'm writing this review is that I truly believe, gangster burger has gotten a bad rap below and I want to push then up to 4 stars.  I dropped in after a visit to Winners and was pleasantly surprised how delicious the Capone burger was... I actually I'm allergic to poppy seeds, so the chef said he would wrap it in lettuce which I thought was genius and delicious. And can I talk about the French fries, soooooo delicious with the homemade garlic aioli.  If you want a combo it's only an extra 4 buck...which I thought wasn't bad. All in all, I will be going back for sure,"}
{"text":"With a million burgers in Toronto, it's sadly hard to find a decent burger joint that delivers, a juicy burger with a flare of awesome flavours and a cool vibe that doesn't charge you an arm and a leg, make you wait forever and satisfy your hunger...until now. As you walk in, the walls are covered in a well planned gangster themed wallpaper and old school hip hop is playing on the speakers creating a much different vibe than the typical \"ironic tunes\" that plays in most Indy spots these days.  Gangster Burger offers a small menu of gangster themed burgers (Capone, Escobar) that are juicy with a simple toppings that aren't over done but are certainly have that punch of a boost to your taste buds that make it all worth it.  The thing is, most places pack their burgers full of salt and fat which is what most people mistake for flavour. Gangster burger has managed to step away from that sad norm but delivering that bang, pun fully intended, with their home made sauces and paring of goodness on top of more goodness with fresh ingredients (smoked provolone what!!) and a soft poppy seed egg bun that allows the other bursts of flavour to shine through. I had the Escobar burger topped with a mild cheddar and jalapeño ranch sauce and crushed tortillas which added a nice crunchy texture to the already  delicious taste bud pleaser.  I decided on a side salad which came with marinated onions, oh yes, and a grape soda vinaigrette(can I get a hells ya). The spot is small and you should expect to do a grab and go which is just fine with me. I've read all the other reviews and hey every place goes through growing pains and it looks like they have been listening. I know I'd certainly go back for the Capone burger and fries which are next on the list.  All in all this place is seriously gangsta!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers that will burn into your memory it would be a crime not to go back.   The Dillinger is a 6 OZ beef burger with dill havarti, caramelized onions, chipotle mayo, spicy ketchup a.k.a \"Gangster Goo\", bacon, letuce and tomato. It was absolutely DELICIOUS! $8 and change may seem a little pricey to some but it was worth every bite.   They're sauces are very much worth the indulge. Check it out: http://www.gangsterburger.com/page/menu"}
{"text":"As I am currently a self-proclaimed \"Gourmet Burger Snob\", I was ordered by a friend of a friend to try Gangster Burger. I am both happy that I did and proud to mention that because of this spot, my expectations (and nose) is slightly higher.  A burger is only as good as the meat/patty it's cooked with. Gangster Burger uses fresh ground beef mad into patties, not a patty that was mechanically made and shipped that way. And it's seasoned - real good.  What makes a gourmet burger? Gourmet ingredients.The bun is shipped every morning from a bakery and the menu boasts items such as: smoked provolone, roasted red peppers in a marinara sauce,  dill havarti, caramelized onions, portabello mushroom cap stuffed with marinara and basil pesto sauce, to name a few.  To top it off, Gangster Burger even sells Mexican Coke, which is made from real cane sugar and not fructose.  Do yourself a favor, get the Dillinger with guacamole (it's the Californian in me) and a bottled Coke at the best Gourmet Burger joint this snob has tried in Toronto."}
