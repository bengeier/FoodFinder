{"text":"Service was okay.

Food portions were good for the price, but the food itself sucked. 
The chicken didn't taste like meat, and the spicy eggplant wasn't spicy. The fried rice was okay, but didn't taste like much either. 

Skip this place."}
{"text":"Wasabi Jane's is a nice alternative to traditional Vegas food.  You would think that since this is in a food court that it couldn't be good.  I beg to differ.  During the convention season, WJ's is good break from your regular catered hotel food, but also from the more expensive establishments around the Venetian.

I know it seems odd to have Wasabi Jane's in the same food court as another chain fast food Chinese restaurant.  Wasabi Jane's has something that the other place doesn't offer - the large bowl of noodle soup.  I have ordered both the beef noodle and seafood udon soup a couple times. Each time they were excellent.  

I would take the seafood noodle over the beef.  They both have good flavor, decent portion, and one important ingredient... vegetables.  When on business, it's sometimes difficult to get a good serving of veggies.  The seafood udon makes up for that.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the seafood udon included calamari, shrimp, fish cake and some small scallops.  So, it is a very good mix.

So the trick here, skip the pre-made items on display.  They make the soup fresh in the back, right when you order it."}
{"text":"I don't understand the low ratings!  What do you expect out of places in food courts?  I've gone to WJ many times during business trips to LV and never had an issue.  Granted, they SOMETIMES charge for water, but I believe it's the franchise's policy.  It just depends on who get get to serve you.  Ask nicely.  My favorites are any of their noodle soups.  They make it fresh to order.  Good food, good serving size, good price, and great location!!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today and it will be my last the food is absolutely horrible and has no flavor whatsoever.  Save your time and money do not eat here. Can't go below 1 star or I would."}
{"text":"I didn't expect absolute deliciousness, my expectations were set for a knock-off Panda Express like most every mall and town has. And my expectations were too high,
For $14 I got white rice, noodles, and an entree, plus a drink which to me is pricey for a \"one item combo\". I got a dirty look for requesting rice and noodle, even though the menu photo clearly depicts rice and noodles for the 1-item combo.  

My rice was cold and getting dry, not sticky but crumbly.  Rice should be warm, soft, kind of sticky.

My noodles tastes like liquid smoke. Nothing else. 

My sukiyaki beef was the worst part. The beef was mushy like when you add too much tenderizer, and it was room temperature, not what I would consider a proper serving temperature. The vegetables were so soft I did not even need to bite them, they just kind of mushed in my mouth and slithered down. The dish didn't have much taste but vaguely reminded me of, in texture and taste, the bbq \"rib\" sandwiches available at convenience stores; but this dish was more bland. 

Again, I wasn't expecting much but was very disappointed. I ate maybe a bite of each item and tossed my $14 meal in the garbage. I hope I do not get food poisoning from the few cold bites I stomached."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!! They had great choices in their selection and workers were very friendly."}
{"text":"The food is strictly OK but their servers are horrible. I asked for a mapo tofu and they would give me tons of tofu and very little gravy. When asked for more gravy to be proportionate they had no clue that could even be a request.
They sell bottled water there so they conveniently ran out of water cups and refused to give me water unless i buy a bottle. She refused to fill water in their regular cups. The attitude thrown by the server at checkout was totally unasked for an ridiculous. I would not recommend it to anyone. if you want cheap Asian food at the venetian food court, just go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"Convenience if you work in the area. Who doesn't love sushi burritos these days? I've gone 2-3 times. Their nice, quick, and friendly. I normally stick to the b-2. The panko shrimp has always been perfectly crisp. Rice is good, well everything is always good and fresh. Haven't had a complaint yet. Except the food coma that I always end up in."}
{"text":"Considering we are in vegas, this is cheap food for a moderate price.  Maybe I should have gone to the Panda across the way, at least then I'd get something I expect.   The teriyaki beef was dry and towards the crunchy side.  The rice seemed like it was steamed and all the moisture was taken out."}
{"text":"I was working at the Venetian and chose to eat here. I ordered the combination bowl plus due to no substitutions of meats I added an extra meat. Supposedly Teriyaki Chicken. There was no Teriyaki Sauce added. The other meats were some strange tasting mystery meats. I will never purchase any food from this place again."}
{"text":"Snack here late night. Soup noodles was tasty in cafeteria style food court. Beef noodle had tender beef slices. Noodle was a little expensive for small bowl of soup noodle. This was located inside the casino so that is why it may not have been a good value for the money."}
{"text":"I ordered a one item combo and got friend rice and chow mein with teriyaki chicken. The chicken was of very low quality and did not taste fresh. The fried rice was OK but the chow mein was lacking in flavor and bland. I was pretty disappointed with the portion size as well. As far as chinese fast food places go, this place has to give the smallest portions that I have seen. There are alternatives in the Venetian and Palazzo that offer better quality food at around the same price. If you really need your chinese fast food fix, I'd recommend walking a few more steps to panda express."}
{"text":"Panda was closed for renovations so I went here! I haven't been here in years and they complete changed the menu! And for the better. I got the sushi burrito Poke Crunch. It was amazing and everything was fresh! Took 5 mins to make but 10 minute wait cuz I went during peak time. Not bad! Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"Very good hangover food. The beef noodle soup, at $8.99, is a bargain compared to all the other overpriced crap in vegas.  I've had this bowl of soup on three separate occasions. Tasty each and every time although the portions seemed to vary up to 20%.  The rest of the bin food looked rather mediocre though. If you are going to do the 1side 2 item combos, probably better to look to panda express across the way."}
{"text":"O oh OH my what a disappointment 

Employees seemed ok but not all
There

Food looked good 

BUT

The broth tasted funny in the beef noodle soup and the noodles tasted like the broth YUCK

The PHO was terrible

Worst egg rolls ever 

WTF is the deal with no pork!! Who Are they catering actually"}
{"text":"I visited this place last year with my parents, when we leave, I forgot to take my bag and leave it on the chair. When we noticed, it has been half an hour. 
So, after I go back, my bag is missing, disappeared. But a very nice lady in this restaurant helps me find it!!! She helps me to call the security guy, and then there is a decent gentleman bring my bag back!!!
Five stars for good heart !!!!"}
{"text":"I thought Wasabi Jane's is just another fast food stand located in the Food Court within the Venetian Casino and Resort, it just doesn't quite measure up to the rest of the stands. Having two kids in tow, the family doesn't have the luxury to sit through fine dining or extended meals. This was one of the food stands we stopped at for dinner. 
The ordering process was fine, and we asked for one cup of ice water, and they proceeded to charge us 10 cents for the ice water. When inquired what the charge was, they replied \"plastic cup\". For the life of me, I could not locate that \"cup charge\" on their menu anywhere, and that is either false advertising or some type of bad business practice which I will later on report to BBB. 
Their udon noodle was just ok, nothing too outstanding, but that charge left a sour taste in our mouths. 
Oh, and just for your reference, walk 10 steps to the Panda Express in the same food court, and you can get ice waters (yes, plural), extra plates, extra napkins, fortune cookies, and utensils, all for FREE!
Never going back to Wasabi Jane's. Another thing, they spell their name as \"Wassabi Jane's\" on their receipt. Anyone who cannot spell their own names properly really should not be operating any business."}
{"text":"Looks good but don't get fooled! This was the worst seafood udon I have ever tasted. Seafood tasted old and soup tastes like water. Horrible!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here! Waste of money!
Beef soup has no tAste! Broth taste like water! So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Poor service and bad food. Avoid this place.  I am surprised something of this poor quality and with rude service is in business at this resort.  The people behind the counter either could not speak english or intentionally acted ignorant.  If I asked a question about the price of switching out a side dish they would answer \"yes\".  If I asked what the ingredients were in any dish they would reply with \"yes\".  When I asked for the manager two different people could not respond other then looking at me and asking me what I wanted to order.   I stood my ground and eventually the manager came over.  I soon learned she was the authoritative teacher of rudeness.  I see other reviews comment on how they are not upfront about their pricing and that their quality varies.  I simply asked why they don't have people speaking english.  NO reply.  I repeated my question.  She looked at me like I was crazy and asked what I wanted.  I am not rude visitor to restaurants and most people working at restaurants are hard workers who deserve respect.  Not these A-holes."}
{"text":"Shit. Literally shit. 
I saw the review of the guy who said beef noodle is amazing here and my beef noodle is soggy, doesn't taste like anything, isn't spicy like it shows in the picture, and just plain bad."}
{"text":"There was nobody in line and i ordered won ton noodle soup. It's now almost 20 minutes later and we are still waiting.  Not what you would expect at the food court let alone for soup. They are not even busy. I've only handed out one other order since we've been standing here"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this is only for the poke bowls- there were some other tasty looking cooked bowls, eg Taiwanese minced pork or Chinese pork bbq bowl, that have potential. 

Food: stopped here for poke bowls. Underwhelmed unfortunately by the flavors of the fish and toppings. Positive thing is the portion size.
Spicy salmon poke: some variation of hot sauce that was semi spicy and really no flavor other than that. 
Salmon poke: was fresh and good cuts.
Seaweed salad topping: way too salty
Edamame, cucumbers: fresh
Onion crisps: hard bits, not crispy
Seaweed salad sesame topping: good

Space: this is in a food court within the Venetian and Palazzo complex. Plenty of seating nearby. 
Service: fast and professional.
Price: overpriced for the quality of food but to be expected on the Strip.

Skip the spicy salmon poke. Try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"So, you have been walking the strip for hours and you finally took in the sites of the Venetian. What do you do now at the 5 star hotel but you don't have 5 star cash? Get a new job player! Just kidding. Hit the food court. My first choice would is the Deli for sure, but if the casino slots have left you with a few dollars short try Wasabi Jane's Rice & Noodle Works. 

Food court options are limited and I always almost barf in my mouth when I see Panda Express. Sadly, I rather shallow barf than eat there. Just saying. Wasabi is a similar combo asian food place. A lot of greese and fried food for your delight. 

On my last visit to the Venetian food court, I saw a sign for beef noodle soup. I know I was taking a risk trying a random place, but it was worth a shot. The soup was hearty and a little msgy, but overall tasty. It was filling and didn't leave me craving more. Not the best soup but for a cheap shake on budget this was good enough. 

I can't recommend this place, because the quality is okay. If you had enough buffet and you want something tasty and fast, it is worth a try. If you don't fill like getting a sandwich at the deli, concider trying Wasabi's. If you are super picky when it comes to asian food, skip. 

I hope this helps with your decision. Usually no waiting here.

{"text":"Yeah I'm not a fan of how bland their food tasted. Something about soggy cabbage that wasn't washed right threw me off. It's like two bites in and that was just not the business"}
{"text":"I ordered noodles with a combo of two vegetables as I am vegetarian. The food was good for me as I like spicy food. They were polite and friendly too. If you like Asian and spicy food, this is the place for you. It is good to satisfy your taste buds if you're an Indian and want to get a fusion kind of food. I just loved the food."}
{"text":"The yakisoba noodles are great but I'm not a huge fan of the fried rice. The spicy chicken was okay, it was strange how half of the chicken was breaded and half was not. My boyfriend got there eel on rice and it was very very small. I work at the Venetian so I probably will come and just get noodles."}
{"text":"Wasabi Jane's looked like the most heallty alternative in the food court.  
However, on Nov 8, 8:49 pm, Clerk \"02\" was so busy texting that she failed to notice me for four minutes.  I stood, watching her, wondering what happened to work ethic.   Finally clerk looked up, answered,  a few questions about the ordering process  and I ordered the vegetable plate.   

I'm still confused about this part.   She placed the plate of food at the far end of the counter, then motioned me to move to the cash register.  I paid the fee, ignoring the \"TIPS\" jar (bad customer service = no tip!), she handed me the change, no, \"thank you\", and placed the napkin and plastic fork by the cash register.

The food looked okay but I was soured by the selfish text-addicted clerk and when I lifted the first fork of food to my mouth, the food was less than room - temperature.

Shouldn't \"hot\" food be served \"hot?\"

HEALTH DEPARTMENT, IS THIS LEGAL?

Note: If the clerk had been personable and professional, and the food actually \"hot\", I'd give this place a ****."}
{"text":"We love the Venetian and one of the reasons is the great selection of food, from cheap eats to wow, did I just spend 500$. 
Wasabi is great. It is located in the one of the food courts. The service is fast, the items all hot and fresh and the service perfect.
You will get a lot for your money and it is super tasty. It is a great choice for lunch or a late night snack."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good, considering it's at a food court. After a long night of partying, I really wanted some hangover food.... and I found it! 

At first glance, I thought this place was your typical fast-food chinese place, but when I looked at the menu, I saw that they serve udon - yumm! I ordered the tempura udon and my boyfriend had the seafood soup. The broth was super hot and reallyyyy soothing. It didn't have a ton of flavor but I didn't really mind - I just wanted something hot. The noodles seemed pretty fresh and were also really good. The udon came with 3 tempura shrimps. It was a bit heavy on the batter but it was alright when I soaked it in the soup first. For $8, it wasn't a bad meal.

I think I read on someone else's review that they charge $0.10 for water? The lady that helped us was really nice and gave us 2 cups of it for free."}
{"text":"Came here twice in one weekend. A good place for a nice hot noodle soup. They have a variety of soups. The first day I came here I tried the shrimp tempura udon. This was exactly what I needed because I was dying from partying too hard the night before. The noodles were the perfect texture and they definitely didn't skimp on the fish cakes in the soup. The second time I came here I got the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and this was not a disappointment either. The beef was super tender and I loved the pickled greens in the soup. There was a lot of beef in the soup too. For both soups the broth was a little salty for me but I normally don't like my dishes with a lot of salt. They also have dim sum items. They have a display of some of their food items which I thought was kinda tacky but whatever. The cashier was nice, but they do need to work on an ordering system, i think I might've cut someone in ordering food and the food came out pretty fast both times."}
{"text":"As someone who works just a few restaurants away I like a different taste and to me this isnthe place to go!

Very kind and great service!
Food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Worst place I've been too in Vegas. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. How the hell does the white rice taste bad.... chicken is horrible also. Spend 19 dollars and threw it away and got Panda Express. Yes, that bad."}
{"text":"My dad was craving some Chinese food, so he opted for this place instead of Panda Express since \"you can go to Panda anytime\". 

I ordered a one-item plate with half noodles/rice and sesame chicken.  Please do not order this. After my meal, I felt queasy for the rest of the day. My dad ordered a plate with chicken teriyaki which tasted a lot better. Our two meals combined came out to a little over $17. Not worth it. 

The younger girl who served us was really nice though. She gave us two cups of free tap water, even though the older lady told her not to."}
{"text":"??????????????????
?????????????????????????????????
???????????...???
?????????????????"}
{"text":"Low class food.  Horrible service.  Asked for and extra packet of plum sauce and rude lady behind the counter said no.  Overpriced dirty Chinese food.  Better off going to Panda Express in the other side of the food court for better tasting food and service."}
{"text":"Last day here and we just wanted something quick before we headed to the airport. My sister wanted something like Bourbon Chicken that they have at the shopping malls here. She said the teriyaki chicken was close enough. Food was okay, but oily."}
{"text":"This place is located above the Venetian casino in the Grand Canal food court.  During my stay at the Venetian, I ate here once.  This place is almost identical to Panda Express in relation to what they offer.  However, one difference is that they offer freshly prepared udon soups.  I ordered the two item combo for $7.99.  

I got half fried rice, half chow mein, chicken teriyaki, and sesame chicken.  The chow mein was really good, with not too much stuff in it.  It was simply noodles.  I regretted that I did not get all chow mein!  The chicken teriyaki was full of flavor-- but they gave me too much sauce. :(  The sesame chicken was great too-- very moist and tasty.  I will give this place a whirl again for a quick bite if I am ever in this food court!  Otherwise find me at the buffets :)"}
{"text":"Food court quality Japanese Hawaiian Chinese fusion.  Nothing remarkable to say.  The rice was perhaps the best part of the dish and was definitely good. Not disappointing by any stretch - just didn't push anything over the top. The price was definitely $$ and a little higher than I would have anticipated.  All said, it was probably better than most of the reviews on yelp indicated but definitely not four star quality.   Not bad for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Lunch at work today brought me to Wasabi Jane's in the Venetian's food court. Normally I would just go to Walgreens but I was craving some Asian food and on a 30 minute break from work the food court was my only option. I usually just swing by Panda Express even though I'm not much of a fan because its quick and generally reliable. Today however I made the dramatic change of 50 ft across the food court (mainly b/c when I went to Panda they looked like they just got smashed with a lunch rush and the choices were limited) to Wasabi Janes. It is a $1 and change more ($7.99) for a 2item combo with 1 side than PE. So I figured what the heck I'll try it... looked pretty good. 
1) food selection was decent with a few different items from PE but I don't think as many selections.
2) the lady behind the counter asked me \"is that all?\" after I had already told her I wanted the combo and all that was on my plate was rice. I didn't laugh at her though. **pats self on back**
3) the food was not as fresh or hot as i would have liked for it to be
4) the food did taste good though and the portion was a bit larger than my normal portions from PE

Normally I would go back and ask for something different or for them to heat it up but I just didn't have time today. Overall, not a terrible experience but not the best either. Probably right on par with PE in my book. May give them another try sometime when I'm craving Chinese again at work. I will make sure to sample what I'm getting first though to see if its hot."}
{"text":"Problem: You and your friends decide to celebrate a bachelor's party in Vegas. In keeping with the wedding party in Vegas tradition, you drown yourself in liquor, eventually falling into a drunken stupor. Before you know it, it's morning. You walk to the bathroom and realize one of your lateral incisors is missing. Ignoring the fact that a tiger, an abandoned baby, and a chicken are running around your suite, your stomach demands sustenance. Oh, and you only have 10 bucks.

Solution: Wasabi Jane's

Wasabi Jane's is another typical Asian take-out restaurant. Located within the Venetian food court, and situated across the way from a Panda Express, Wasabi Jane's has your typical selection of Asian food.

I purchased a 3 item combo. You will likely have some leftovers if you order the 3 item combo, even if you split it among 2 people.

I ordered the chow mein, chicken teriyaki, and the beef (I forgot which variety. Oops.) I admit that the noodles were somewhat greasy. The proteins were tasty, though.

The most discerning foodies will not find this place very tasty. For everyone else with a stomach to fill, and a hangover to heal, I'd think you'll be thoroughly pleased."}
{"text":"A nice little Asian gem among the host of eateries in the Hotel's food court. They have quite a nice spread of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Their tofu was extremely soft and the noodles were flavorful."}
{"text":"Just ate at this place for lunch, its located in the grand canal food court of the Venetian hotel. Overall, pretty good food, resembles that of panda express. Fried rice and sesame chicken were both spectacular. Only down side was the portion sizes (a little small). Great place for a quick lunch, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place claimed to sell terriyaki chicken, but I'm pretty sure it was pork.  It was expensive, and not very good.  I think I'll stick to Chicken Now or the pizza place in this food court from now on."}
{"text":"This convenient restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. It is on the 2nd floor where all the other \"more affordable\" fast food eateries are located. I cannot really make a long review since this is not a full dine in restaurant. lol BUT the service was great! The guys that worked the food line were really nice! And they recommended the Roasted Duck bowl to me since I told them I love duck! The food was AMAZING! For it to just be a mall eatery restaurant? I was amazed that it was REAL DUCK with the bone! And it was a big bowl with rice and some veggies. It tasted very good. My friends orders the POKE BOWL? which was ok? and someone else ordered the soup which they said was surprisingly good too! The price is around $10-$15 and of course drinks are around $3.99 for a bottle water and other drinks are $3 plus too. lol Its VEGAS! If you want some great asian food in Vegas this is a hidden spot you don't want to miss."}
{"text":"Everyone should have low expectation from a food court shop in Vegas. Food is so-so and price is high. On top of that, the cashier would take order from someone who obviously cut in line instead sending the person to the end of the line. Very disappointing and disgusting."}
