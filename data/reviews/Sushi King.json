{"text":"The all you can eat is pretty good sushi and there is a lot of choice on the menu as well as no limit  to number of items you can order (some places limit the amount of sashimi you are able to order). The service was great as well and parking was not an issue."}
{"text":"Went May 06, 2009, but friends have been going again a few times and it's still just as TERRIBLE.

I actually found the decor pretty nice.  The service was meeh because it wasn't that busy.  But she barely came over to us because we were all you can eat customers. (There were \"REAL\" customers there at the time).

We had the AYCE.  We didn't expect a lot because it is AYCE after all.
We had a tempera shrimp, the batter wasn't fully inflated (is that the word for it?).  Like the tempera was just FLAT.  Either they didn't do it wrong or the batter was old...SUPER old...
The red tuna and salmon sushi had a fridge and plastic taste to it.  Everything just tasted weird!  Seem like it had been fridged for a while.  The unagi was alright, and so was the spicy salmon and tuna strips.  The salmon sashimi tastes better than the salmon sushi.  I don't think they used the same ones for the sushi. But the salmon and tuna in in the spicy rolls tasted like it was in a contained for a while...the creamy scallop's mayo tasted old...

The chicken teriyaki roll was really dry and there were no sauce at all!
The rolls were almost 2 inches per piece!  I know this is all you can eat...but SERIOUSLY????  No!!  That's not what you do to your customers! 

Normally, restaurants are suppose to taste the best when they first open because they want to give a good impression...but nope...
Honestly...don't even waste your time and money.
Last thing to say about this restaurant...I pooped like 3 times when I got home!  Definitely not fresh!

{"text":"If you are looking for consistent quality, this place is not for you.

We go lots for it's all-you-can-eat, I'm there mostly for the salmon sashimi. Nigiri sushi is not quite worth it as they pack lots of rice in it. I would recommend going on friday nights, after the rush (at around 7-8pm), then they have good sashimi (probably because they buy lots of fresh fish for friday nights)

The things that I like to order when we are there are:

Salmon & Tuna sashimi
Smoke salmon salad
Teriyaki steak & chicken
Deep fried calamari

I don't really order the rest that much as I don't want to fill myself up with rice!

BTW, the tempera is aweful. Don't order."}
{"text":"Ambience (2/5)- The place is decorated fine for what it is. Tacky, unauthentic, and uninspired. Renovated McDonalds look and feel way better.

Service (2/5)- The servers were as good as any robot would have been. Plopped down utensils and an all-you-can-eat menu. Ours did check on us at one point, but that's expected right?

Food (1/5) - It was a lot of hit and miss, and I get that it's AYCE, but the quality wasn't fit for dogs with a number of items. The Chicken Teriyaki Rolls had old, stale, dry chicken in them. These were painful to eat. The giant tolls might as well have been bowls of rice (75% of the roll was rice). The hokkigai (surf clam) were old, soggy, and tasteless. The Tako (octopus) was slimy and far from fresh. Our sweet omelet (these are always yellow, as eggs should be) were GREY. I didn't feel like going to the hospital, so the eggs were left uneaten. The rice, by the way, is poorly prepared. Our deep fried items came out soggy and might as well have been steamed.

Presentation (2/5) - Lackluster and uninspired. They put pieces of lettuce around your sushi to spice up the plate, but it doesn't help when the lettuce is old and wrinkly. 

Value (1/5) - Terrible. Way too much rice on the rolls is a straight gouge at the customer, especially when they like to strictly enforce charging you for uneaten food. At 27.50 (including a mandatory 10% gratuity, because if it was your choice, you'd leave nothing), the price is highway robbery. The scraps at Calgary's finer sushi restaurants have more value than Sushi King.

Overall (1/5) - Will never go back and recommend that no one go there. Our server told us that the eggs were normal being grey - that they were overcooked at worst. So if you want overcooked, grey soggy eggs, I suppose Sushi King is for you. Horribly run business."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of \"all you can eat\" sushi because it's usually terrible, but I was with a group and this is what we ordered. Never again, not ever at this place nor any other. The fish they used for the rolls and sushi were end scraps. Nothing smelled off but the presentation was terrible and the portions were extremely small/scrappy. I did not see pride of ownership at this joint. Our server was cold. The decor was nice... it was obviously an Italian restaurant before it was Sushi King. I have not tried the Sushi King lunch bento boxes or the dinner menu but I might... maybe. I'd rather walk down to Shikiji on Center Street for fresh, beautifully presented sushi."}
{"text":"The good: Affordable especially if you, or someone you are with is a big eater. Tons of menu options on the all-you-can-eat, and enough stuff to avoid sushi if you're not a sushi fan. Veggies, meat, etc. 

The bad: They frequently hide shrimp tails in the rolls. It's pretty awful to chew on those and especially awful if you accidentally swallow a hard, scrapey shrimp tail. I just about gagged the first time I found (and ate) one in my dynamite rolls. When I brought it to the server's attention she was very unconcerned, as if this were normal. It's not normal to eat shrimp tails/shells, folks. In rolls that's why most sushi restaurants leave the tails hanging out of either end, so the person eating it can see them and not eat them. I asked the server if I could have a dynamite roll made without tails, and she said no, that they were all done like that and they were all pre-made. So that's a bit weird. That happened again on a future visit. Then I kind of didn't want to go there anymore. I especially didn't want to eat the dynamite rolls, or their sushi at all, any more."}
{"text":"We've always had good sushi at Sushi King.  It's AYCE and as expected, the service is based on a one time order, hoping that you won't order more than you can eat.

If you don't like something you can send it back and tell the waitresses.  There are no male servers at Sushi King.

I've never seen anything on our plates that didn't look fresh and taste fresh.  

Since we've had Sushi all over North America inlcuding homemade Sushi in a fisherman's home, we know what to order that suits our palates.

We usually order Gyoza, Tempura (never had it flat, it's always crispy and hot) and lots of salmon, tuna, snapper and a few rolls.  

The only  questionable sushi we've had  at SK was subsequently not ordered again.  Both times it involved cooked fish skin.

The reason the gratuity is now  included is a lot of young people skipped on the tip.  

The staff are pretty cool.  We visit every couple of months and we are, like other familiar folks, rememberd and served accordingly.  

The Last time we were there,  we sat beside a couple breaking up.   She was in tears and he looked like he wanted to crawl under a rock.  The staff put their sushi in a ToGo container (unheard of at AYCE places).  It warmed my heart to see such kindness.

On our anniversary,  my husband hated his Sake, having lost his taste for rice wine over the years, making it known that he didn't like it.  Our Server brought him plum wine as a gift.  

No, the decor is not upscale, but it's clean, neat and I'd rather a plain decor and decent food than upscale decor and out of business."}
{"text":"I love all you can eat sushi places because of the selection and because you know it's fresh-er than most places since they're always making more rolls. Or at least I tell myself that.

In any case, I joke with my friends that if you go to a sushi place and you're the only white people than you know you're at a good spot. Sushi King is that place.

I go here probably once every 6 weeks - with a varying group of people - and it's always the same quality which I love. I love consistency - not just in food but also with the staff and the atmosphere and Sushi King delivers.

If you live in the NE or NW or even downtown and you have a hankering for sushi, go here :)"}
{"text":"It's finally open!  

Sushi King has 2 menus to offer you:  AYCE (All you can eat) for $25/person or a normal menu.  We've tried both.  

AYCE is better if you have more time to indulge.  They give you a list that you tick off the no. of items you want.  There is a menu that gives a little more details on the item.  There is sashimi, sushi, rolls, cooked food and even dessert.  The rolls are not too bad - a little hastily made.  I liked the special scallops sushi, the salmon sashimi was good;  if you want to be brave, give the salmon kama a try - grilled salmon neck - finger-lickin' good!  Cooked food ranged from rice, noodles, tempura, gyoza, oysters - lots of varieties.  

Just know what you've ordered 'cos there were some items that appeared that we didn't remember ordering! 

Also, all rice must be eaten when ordered.  Be careful, 15% gratuity is added to the bill when AYCE is ordered.

The regular menu is not too bad - we were there at lunchtime and they had a bento box.  At the time, the rolls were moist and delightful.  The rolls in the AYCE was not as good.  Good value for the bento box $10.95 - includes miso soup, salad, rolls, teriyaki steak or chicken and tempura."}
