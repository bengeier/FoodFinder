{"text":"The food was awesome. Ordered a few things off the menu and everything was great. Korean with a twist. The Ribs were phenomenal. Great staff and service. Closing soon. Very sad I check it out so late."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries! Soo good! My friend and I went there for lunch on her birthday. The food we ordered were the chicken Korrito and the lettuce leaf beef wraps. And the Kimchi fries! It was tasty, the price was reasonable and the portions were big--I had to take half of the Korrito home for dinner! The service wasn't great though. She came to see if we were ok but didn't really smile. Also the menu didn't describe the dishes and they weren't self explanatory. I hate that. I enjoy reading about what I'm about to order. I hope to go back soon to get another serving of those fries!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly amazing. The atmosphere and food is phenomenal, easily some of the best food in the yonge and eg area. The menu is a little intimidating for those who don't know the cuisine and could use a redesign, but we tried a few dishes which lead to more... And more... And more! Loved every bit of the experience which combines a chic Korean restaurant with a stylish tapas bar. The price of everything has astounding value, even the drinks. A must try is the \"sawdust chicken\" with the \"skillet corn\". Easily the best bar in the area for a hearty meal and good buzz without hurting your wallet that rivals the best of downtown in atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan, maybe I don't like Korean food though. My partner really likes it. He likes the pork bone soup and everything else he's had there. This place did make me realize that I love cider, Sommersby is served here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had high hopes for this place as there aren't many Korean places at yonge and Eglinton. 

The atmosphere is a little dull and some things seem out of place, like flowers covered in plastic wrap. It just seems like the place has a bit of an identity crisis. 

The food is decent. We ordered Korean Beef tacos, spicy beef tacos, kimchie fries, Korean pickles and soya sauce wings. Very small portions, which means you'll probably need to order a lot of items. It was kind of nettlesome though that the chicken wings, appetizers, ended up arriving last... After we ate everything else. 

Other than the lengthy wait for the wings, service is good. 

It's understandable that Korean Cowboy is a new restaurant and that it may take them time to find their stride, but at this point it is difficult to recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I was immediately intrigued by this place because of its name. No matter how hard and try to visualize it, I just can't picture a Korean Cowboy. 

The food here is quite good. Being Asian myself, I love rice dishes in general. Something about them just makes me feel like home. They have some pretty funky selections on the menu, which seems to have been updated significantly since they first opened. 

The lunch menu is pretty good value for the area, and the dinner options have all been great. I think the only thing lacking is their cocktail menu. It's never appealed to me, which is disappointing for a pub. 

It doesn't look like they did much to upgrade the ambiance from the Main Event days. Given that the whole strip will probably be torn down for condos within the next five years, it was probably a good idea. 

If you live in the area and want Asian food that isn't Japanese, this is really one of your only options (unless you consider the Chinese food at Pickle Barrel or C'est Bon to be Asian, in which case, I am quietly judging you). If you want authentic Asian cuisine, go to Little Sister."}
{"text":"Cool concept but the food just never delivered. I've been here a couple of times due to the fact I work across the street.

Menu isn't appetizing at all and the only item I could recommend would be the Kim chi fries. Even though they are super cheap with the Kim Chi."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here and the service was attentive but not overbearing. I tried a simple selection from the Anju menu and it was exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for a quick lunch. I'm not too sure how I feel about the setup of the tables...

As for the food, she ordered the rice bowl with Korean bbq beef and I got the lettuce wrap tacos with Korean bbq beef, chicken and spicy pork. We also got the skillet corn to share. She said the rice bowl was pretty mediocre and id have to say the same for the lettuce wraps. The only thing I'd recommend is the skillet corn. That was really good in both our opinions. 

Other than that, I don't really have any complaints. The server was really sweet and kind."}
{"text":"Was really hoping this place would be good...but very disappointed in their service....

I arrived with my gf to no lineup and the friendly hostess told us it would be 5 minutes as she cleaned a table for us. As we waited, 3 other groups arrived. A large group left, making it easy for the hostess to sit all 4 groups at the same time. 

All 3 of the other tables had their orders taken for drinks within 5-6 minutes while we sat and waited. I tried to flag down a waitress with no luck. Finally after 20-25 minutes a waitress came and took our drink and food order at the same time. Another 20 minutes go by, and still no drinks. I looked over at the 3 tables that were sat at the same time as us. One couple was almost finished their first pints, another couple had received their drinks a long time ago, and already received their food and had begun eating. When I had a chance, I gave our waitress a smile and a \"what about us?\" look as she walked by and she said \"its coming!\" in a not-so-polite tone.

Another 15 minutes go by. I look up to the bar. Our drinks haven't even been poured yet. Our waitress came to the first table that already received their food, and she took their 2nd drink order. I tried again to ask her, and she ignores me. At this point we have been sitting in this restaurant for nearly 50 minutes and our drinks had still not been brought to us. Needless to say we got fed up, so we just walked out. I have never done that before...but I was just so annoyed that I would have to wait 50 minutes for a beer... in a bar...when we were there before all the tables around us!!

I'm hoping it is because they are new, and maybe the staff was just confused as they got used to their sections...but it blew my mind that a new restaurant would have such horrible service. I don't plan on going back anytime soon because of this, although the food did look pretty decent."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one day with the husband and found an extremely limited menu. There's one page of food options and about 4 pages of drink options on the lunch menu. The waitress was fast and polite but didn't seem to speak or understand English very well (maybe we should have guessed that based on the name of the restaurant). We ended up ordering a couple of appetizers that are exclusive to the dinner menu without much trouble though and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the wings. The kimchi fries are decadent and interesting but we aren't sure if we would order them again. The tacos and corn skillet were both amazing but the corn skillet is literally just a skillet of corn, so if you don't love corn it might not be the app for you."}
{"text":"Unique collection of Korean-inspired pub food. I had the Tuesday special - Bulgogi (BBQ beef with corn). Its quite delicious and reasonable priced!"}
{"text":"Thursdays - Half Price Wings! 

My friend and I came for lunch and we decided to share a Kimchi Burger and 2 pounds of wings. 

I really had high expectations for this burger after seeing it on a blog site. The patty was super dry and lacked flavouring. The bun also mediocre and I've had better kimchi before. 

But the wings... Those were pretty good. They were decent sized and we had the spicy honey mustard and soy glaze. I'm usually not a fan of saucy wings but I'd go back for these. 

When the bill came we realized the wings were more than half the regular price. The waitress told us that we were looking at the lunch menu and the half price only applies to the dinner price. She was fully aware we were looking at the lunch menu as we ordered too and didn't bother to tell us."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch during the weekday not knowing what to expect. I knew it's been open for awhile and that it was a Korean fusion bar. Last time I checked it out, it was just for drinks so I didn't have much to talk about. Anyways, their menu is pretty extensive and 'interesting' for a Korean bar. You can tell they try to be different and came up with all these dishes that can't be found at any other Korean restaurants. My server Sarah was very kind and informative with explaining all the items to me every time I had questions. From what I ordered (and shared with friends) I enjoyed their spicy rice cake, deep fries spaghetti and braised pork belly. You see the items on the menu and think it's a little pricey for a bar menu but it's def not bar size food! I would say their main dishes are big enough to be shared by 3 people or more. Overall I really enjoyed my meal at Korean Cowboy and I will def be back!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre experience. It's nice that you can get a little bit of Asian bar experience with the beer snacks but honestly the food was so so. I would have rated it 3 stars for effort but the service was lacking. It seems like the servers were in lala land and were not at all attentive. I waved a guy down for the bill. He acknowledged then got distracted and started serving other customers. I had to physically get up to get his attention again. When paying the server girl asked us if we want the receipt. We said yes please and next thing you see her walking away and throwing the receipt out. So I have no idea where their head is and the place is empty so more perplexing. 

Overall so so food with weird service. Hence the 2 stars"}
{"text":"I was really, really hoping I'd love this place, but I was very disappointed.  The other night we went for late night snacks and here's how it went:

I ordered a coke, which wasn't listed on the menu but I assumed it wouldn't be more than $3.  It came in a glass bottle like they serve a few doors down at the Vietnamese restaurant for $2.75, but Korean Cowboy charges $4.99!!!!!! That's outrageous. The food was totally not memorable. We ordered the kimchi rolls (nice presentation) but they were far too salty.  The green tea infused pork came with a really wet, thinly sliced and sweetened daikon to use like a wrap for the pork.  Eaten together it's good, but the pork on its own was on the salty side.  We also ordered the \"cheesy\" rice cakes.  There wasn't any cheese actually visible on the rice cakes. Normally you'd see melted cheese on this dish, but it really tasted like powdered cheese mixed into the sauce. I asked our server where the cheese was and she said you can't see it, but it's in the taste.  And you could taste a sweet artificial cheese flavour, but I didn't like it very much. 

The server was nice and you can tell they all have to hustle hard to keep things under control. However, trying to get the bill took forever and we felt ignored possibly because we weren't there to get drunk.  

Maybe they're still working out kinks in the kitchen, maybe they really only value the alcohol sales.  Overall, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 different meat tacos here. I think they were the worst I've had in a long while. Also there was some sort of liquid dripping onto our table from the ceiling, which could of gotten into our food or drinks. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I ate spicy chicken and corn here. For me the corn was good and the chicken could be better. They say it's spicy but unfortunately it was not spicy,  and a little bit sweet actually. My girlfriend (Korean)  recommends this place to drink, and not for dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty cool bar! Korean food in western style bar. Perfect if u just want a regular pub but with asian snacks! The menu offers u food in terms of size - small, medium, or large meals. Makes it easy to order! We just got beef jerky (was ok. Too stiff. Wouldnt order it again), pork ribs (pretty good, although the sauce is a bit on the sweet side according to my high-standard taste), octopus salad (pretty good, but too little pieces), and a fruit salad (pretty good, refreshing). Woukd definitely come back for a nice time with friends who have eclectic food needs!"}
{"text":"Tried them first time a week ago for lunch Loved the korritos and kimchi fries. Great price and big portion."}
{"text":"I live and work right at yonge/sheppard/finch so there are no shortages of Korean restaurants/bars on this stretch. But, my coworkers happened to be in the area and we decided to go there for drinks.

Nothing fancy and can't say much about the food, however, they do have a wide variety of \"Asian\" drinks such as Soju's, Sake's, beers and what appears to be a Korean/Japanese version of fruit beers (to which one of my co-workers mentioned it was SUPER SWEET!)

I think this is a very casual hang-out and if you're hankering for some late Korean grub. But, we all decided to head over to the Crown which is always a happening and live place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. 

We were excited to come watch some Sunday night football here because they have so many TVs and cheap food. 

The food was OK. The best part of it was the corn cheese thingy. Also, $4.99 for a Sprite? Come on. I know it comes in the glass bottle but... No. 

The reason it was such a disappointment was the service, or, lack there of. When we came in they were very polite and like, somewhat busy. Fine. We were given our food and drinks and NOT ONCE checked on again. For the rest of the night.  One gentleman in my group asked to order wings and the waiter never even came back. Even when the bar got empty down to four people - no one came to talk to us or take an order for more drinks or anything. 

Not impressed."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers has been here 11 times in 2016 and swears by the Thursday wings deal (wings with fries for $9.99). Personally, I would say Korean Cowboys is meh. I mean, I've had better Korean food and I've been to better pubs. Good effort on the gimmick but fail at the execution - lacks service and not really feeling the vibe of a Korean pub. However, this is the only place with Korean food (unless you count Ho Su) at Yonge and Eglinton so unless you're willing to go north or south for the real deal, the bossam is as close as you'll get to Korean food in midtown."}
{"text":"Went here with a few guys on a Saturday night at 7pm 

Service was generally fine (the male server was pretty nice and on the ball with taking orders and giving suggestions), the female staff were ok but didnt seem to wait around when I wanted to order drinks and more
Food (I didn't even get my water when everyone else did - that was weird). 

Ordered some yummy food: 

Wings - juicy, good size, crispy exterior.  Liked the sweet and spicy, and spicy honey mustard flavour. The soy flavour was a bit salty and not as yummy in our opinion, but it was not nad either. I usually like my wings goopy with sauce and these were slightly coated with sauce, but interestingly, they were so tasty and good that I still really liked it! Good portion size for $15. I would order these again. I am so tired of getting dried out, tiny wings At other bars. 

Kimchi fries - I liked these a lot, but the guys prefer the ones at bang million boys. kCowboys version includes fries that are more thin and dry (in a good way.. Think home style McDonald's fries) with a kimchi sauce as opposed to fat fries with kimchi chunks and goopy amounts of mayo, which is ban mi boys style. So, all down to personal preference. 

Mocha pork belly - good, tender, would say that you could try ordering it, for us I feel like we have had better pork belly but I would try the one wrapped around the green chili next time. 

Sawdust chicken - tasty!! Try it! Good flavour, texture... Just go try it. 

Pork tacos with lettuce wraps - a little bit messy but not more messy than eating kimchi fries with your fingers.  Tasty, good flavour. I am used to eating that lettuce wrap dish you order when you have Peking duck in chinese restaurants, and it was much less messy to eat kCowboys version of lettuce wrap compared to a Peking duck wrap. Good twist on the lettuce wrap idea. 

Hite bottled beer - good, reminded me of a light beer (waitress said it was a medium beer. I am not a Strong beer drinker tho so i might not know the difference) 

Spaghetti - cute, crunchy, was kindly given on the house. 

Another user commented on the $5 pop - yeah that's pretty pricey, especially when the Hite beer is $5.50.  You might as well order a beer instead, or water instead of a pop. I understand why they charge more for pop in a bar venue, but to the owners, I would suggest rethinking that $5 price as it gives an initial poor impression to First timers, and. I don't think you really get much out of that extra $1-2 per drink to overcome the sticker shock. 

Overall, I would suggest that you check this place out of you are in the neighbourhood. I never went here when it was Main Event, it was too much of a boozing tacky sports bar for me.  This place still has a bunch of screens showing sports, but is not a tacky bar, so good for the guy groups but also mixed groups too.  The sweet and spicy wings were really, really good!   I will go back with friends agai to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Kimchi fries are so good!! Good night with decent prices and good eats. 

Soju and a pint of sommersby for 21$ would give you a good time. Will come again if in the area."}
{"text":"I like the vibe here. It's an interesting spot which definitely is a hot spot in this neighbourhood, conveniently located just a bit north of eglinton subway. I like the music they play, a good mix of the old and the new. When it's busy I find the service was horrible. When I first came in I wasn't even approached for 30 minutes, then after my friends came and we got our first round of drinks, then didn't acknowledge us for literally Over an hour almost hour and half. Id be ok w that on a busy night, however the floor we were on was almost empty so I don't like how to get the servers attention I had to wave my hand for almost 5 minutes. The one thing I did like which I'm glad they noticed was when a creepy customer came over to our table and was starting to be creepy and crossing the line w his comments and actions one of the servers did notice it and came over to ask if I was ok, and say sorry. I will go back to check it out again on the second floor because it seemed like a cool vibe there, and I don't want to judge it too severely on one visit but I will give it another shot because it was decently priced and had good \"nibblys \" to pair w the drinks, however I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again or travel up to it from dT at this point in time. It seems to have really good hipe from people so it's a good place to check out if you go to upstairs bar their where they can't ignore or avoid you, and it you have no rush and unlimited time to kill on your hands. Also, they pound the music pretty loud on first floor so it can be hard to keep up an intimate conversation, id do that on second floor or elsewhere if that's the night you need. Overall, decent watering hole for this neighbs, it's pretty big size for along yonge, prices are very fair, but not my fave by far."}
{"text":"I rarely go uptown but as I walked up Yonge, I saw the sign, KOREAN COWBOY. I immediately knew that I had to try this place out. Sometimes I look for a sign from God, this was it.

Unfortunately, I had other plans, so I kept walking and met some friends at another place. But as luck would have it, later on that evening the opportunity would arise. 

As we exited the local cinema, we began the search for a pub. There are plenty of good, run of the mill bars in that area but I knew there was only one place my heart wanted to go...KOREAN COWBOY. The very name filled me with anticipation and the excitement only grew stronger with every step.

To be perfectly honestly, I'm not sure what I expected when I walked into the restaurant. Seoul meets Texas is a bit hard to compute. Maybe a Korean waitress wearing a cowboy hat? Some Gagnam style in the background? Nope, we were greeted by a friendly waitress and promptly seated. The background soundtrack was provided by A Tribe Called Quest. Someone at the KC has some good taste in music. 

Everything was looking up, it was now time for some food. I'm a pretty big fan of Korean Food, so I was anxious to see what they offered. After careful study of the menu, I decided upon the Spicy Pork Tacos. I places my order and waited patiently. 

My tacos arrived a short time later, and I'll tell straightaway, I wasn't disappointed. The pork could've been spicier, but overall they were a delight. My friend ordered the kimchi fries, and I won't lie, they were a little light on the kimchi. They could've used a little more. The soy chicken wings were also very good as well.

Overall, I was quite satisfied with my experience at the big KC and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Kalbi, Korean bbq beef rib platter really good:)

I ordered it on Sunday so it's price is only$10!!
I think it is awesome price :)
At first, I thought it's plenty is a little bit few when I saw pic of this which is located in front of entrance.
However, It was useless to worry about.
Amount of food was fit me:) not lack for me very enough 
And waitress was kind :)
I strongly recommend this restaurant, kalbi and other  things:)"}
{"text":"I went there first time with my friend, the place looks nice and some of the food was okay, but the taco was difficult to eat with hands because rapped with vegetable outside called \"bbosam\""}
{"text":"The good:
- wings - huge thumbs up
- Kimchi Fried Rice
- Radish sides that comes with entrees - odd and not the best presentation but delicious.

The bad:
- Korean fried chicken 
- BBQ Beef & Steamed Bun - huge disappointment 

Fairly inexpensive place with a nice twist on Korean dishes. Would come back to try their other items."}
{"text":"Honestly living close to Koreantown North (yonge and sheppard - yonge and finch). The amount of Korean styled foods I have tried that are fusion style has really spoiled me (cough cough **Han Ba Tang** cough cough). So I might be a tad bit critical.

 I went to Korean Cowboy because the name rung a bell from a BLogTO article; thought I would visit while I was in the neighbourhood. However probably the worst and most expensive  Kalbi  I had, all the added accessories were just ok (mashed potatoes and Taro chips). However at $30 a entrée. I could have ordered so much more at any other location. I heard they recently changed their menu and put prices up. BAD MOVE!

This Korean Cowboy might just not make it out the wild wild west called Yonge - Eglinton. 

P.s- Waiter named Kim is awesome, super knowledgeable and friendly. However some other guy took over our table from her who most likely has a hearing deficiency. Dude was screaming in my ear. With his language barrier- he would answer \"WHAT!\" like a little Jon song being sung in an Asian karoake."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited here the other night. We had a great time starting with some soju and somersby. That stuff is like juice! I've never had it before and we were hooked. The kimchi fries and skillet corn as starters were really good although not at all healthy. We also ordered the pork tacos which were delicious and the Bossam platter which we didn't like at all. It was cold, bland and chewy. We wasted most of it because the meat was so tough. The decor could use a little facelift also. I'd go back but I'd stick to what they do really well."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing up Korean Cowboy for awhile now and we finally ventured in this evening. I was so impressed by it that I decided to create this account just to review it! I loved the atmosphere, the menu and the prices.. and of course most importantly the food! It's a great place to bring a group of people since they have lots of sharing platters.

Service: They were pretty quiet this evening so our server was quick to take our order. Our food was even quicker to arrive: this is always brownie points in my book!

Food: We ordered the kimchi fries and skillet corn for starters and they were both delicious! The kimchi fries were a decent serving portion and could make for a small meal in themselves. As for the skillet corn, I'm still dreaming about it! I wasn't expecting corn to be so tasty but it had melted cheese and butter so, what did I expect? I would return for the appetizers alone! 

For our entrees, we ordered spicy pork tacos, korean beef tacos and the sawdust chicken bites. The tacos were delicious with lots of toppings and lots of flavour. 3 tacos were 8.99 and they were filling! Mutually our table did prefer the spicy pork to the korean beef because it had more flavour and we love spice. The sawdust chicken bites were good but I found them a little more basic. They were/are a great option for those who aren't as adventurous with their food choices. My sister also had a Korean Cheeseburger and although I didn't get to taste it, it smelled amazing (we all commented when it arrived at the table) and she devoured it in a matter of seconds so I'm guessing that's a good sign. I was also really pleased with the fries, which were very crispy and even without any toppings had great seasoning and flavour.

Price: 80$ for 5 people with hearty appetites to feed. I feel like it was pretty reasonable.

Other comments: If you're not very familiar with Korean food I recommend doing a little research before you arrive. We have had Korean before but there was a lot of unfamiliar items to us on the menus. When we asked for recommendations our waitress seemed slightly shocked and with some prodding eventually named a few dishes she liked but we were more interested to hear what other people order! Our choices were perfect nonetheless and aside from that, the staff were friendly and it was an overall good vibe in the restaurant.

Summary: I came home and looked up their menu to plan what I'll be eating next time!"}
{"text":"authentic korean and korean-fusion cuisine in a western (wild west) atmosphere. 

food was delicious but I wished that the servers would explain how to eat/drink their dishes.
I've had Bo Ssam before but for others they may not have tried it before and wouldn't know what to add in their wrap. the kimbap was a little on the salty side so I suggest to half it and add to your wrap instead of eating it in one big bite. I also ordered the Yogurt soju that came with everything separately that you have to mix together yourself. I thought that was a fun experience but I wasn't sure what was happening until i asked the server for directions.

good place to catch up with a friend or two, it can get a little loud in there."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great prices!

Came here with a large group and were treated very well by the staff including complimentary dishes.  Will definitely be back. 

Try the tacos!"}
{"text":"This place could hold over 80 patrons, but was unable to feed 20 people. 

We walked in during Friday lunch hour and were told by the 1 poor waiter that it would take 25 min to get food; no water, no snacks, no attention. 20 minutes later, we were told that it would take another 35 minutes to get food. 
Very very sorry waiter taking care of a few big tables. Only 2 people in the whole restaurant had food.

We left hungry, upset, uncompensated and .... Did I mention hungry? Too bad we drove 40 min to get there, paid for parking and had to get childcare for this highly anticipated disappointment.

Dear management: it takes more than a location and a few nice recipes to make a restaurant. Just sayin'"}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of coworkers for lunch. It was however disappointing that their lunch menu did not have all the small dishes that they are known for. I got the wings with kimchi fries and it was not bad.

Food: 3/5, wings were great but kimchi fries with sweet potato was kind of weird.

Service: 1/5, this is where they lost it for me where the waiter never came back and it was really hard to pay for the meals.

Ambience: 4/5, very cool bar format with great music.

Price: 3/5, average - came to around $15-ish without drinks."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have cheap bottles of soju and a unique twist on bar food. Fried spaghetti is addictive like crack. Kimchi fries are awesome. I would also recommend the green tea infused pork. That has got to be my favorite dish. Their chicken wings are fresh and taste awesome with their unique sauces. I can't wait till my next visit."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night around 10:30pm. Pretty empty when we arrived. We ordered the spicy sesame wings with kimchi fries. Not bad, but the fries were a tad too salty for me. I will be back to try the kalbi platter. Saw someone else order that and it looked great. There is also a karaoke room upstairs beside the washroom."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Their Bo Ssam is especially fantastic. I tasted it and it is as authentic as it gets. My mom (who is a purist when it comes to Korean food) said it was one of the most delicious Bo Ssam she's had in Toronto. Presentation is modern which i like too. Their spicy rice cake is OK but a bit fusion for my taste. Tacos are solid. Service was GREAT. Ambience was cool with the patio door being open. I will definitely be coming back in warmer months."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, Korean Cowboys fuses Korean and Western cuisine to create dynamic results. I came in for lunch and was immediately greeted by the waiter, who was friendly and welcoming. 

They have a unique item called a \"Korrito\", which I ordered. Think pickled vegetables, ginger, steamed rice and Korean-style beef all in one wrap. $7 and it comes with fries, you really can't go wrong. 

Service was slightly slow and they didn't have Sriracha sauce, but they deserve the 5 stars for offering a very unique experience. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Great location, but needs more hot girls, better music. But food is great especially the price point. Love their Korean wings!!"}
{"text":"Everything was so tasty...we actually ordered a second Skillet Corn!  Korean Cowboy serves exactly what their name suggests. ..a perfect East meets West fusion experience!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch recently and really enjoyed the specials they had. The atmosphere is similar to a regular pub which is surprising as the name \"Korean Cowboy\" is fun but there's nothing kitschy or unique about the decor. It was deserted on a Thursday afternoon, a bonus as service was great and the waiter was friendly. My friend and I opted for the wings and fries which were around $8 while another friend got some sort of a rice bowl. The portions were large and extremely worth it for the price. My wings were saucy and the fries were good although I couldn't finish the whole plate. The only disappointment for me was that they didn't serve the anju on their dinner menu as I had really wanted to try the deep fried spaghetti and cheesy corn."}
{"text":"Picture a Korean cowboy..

I doubt you are thinking about a somber scene from the Unforgiven.

Instead, you are likely thinking about Harold and Kumar Visit the Alamo or that annoying guy from the Hangover sporting a Stetson.  

This place is exactly that.... an odd but crazy good time.  With things like butter laden skillet corn and hot dog stir fry on the menu, you can't take things too seriously.  

The Wednesday oyster night is a good value (12 for $12) and they come with 7 different sauces ranging from coffee to Korean Tabasco. 

They have a good selection of craft beer and an array of soju for the traditionalists.

The anju dishes (ie. snacks) I had were great.  The tacos and wings were pretty average.  That said, I could easily go back and eat a half dozen crazy foods I didn't have a chance to touch this time including a variety of pork products.

In the words of Kid Rock... cowboy, baby, i can smell a pig from a mile away.  

I wonder if that includes pork belly.  Yum."}
{"text":"For a place that sounds intriguing and the menu sounding like something that potentially could be amazing. This was very disappointing.
The service was very good. The food is disappointing to average.
We were there at 1pm, so the lunch menu.
I had the 5 dumplings as a starter. Small portions, but I thought they'd taste amazing, as small portions tend to do. Nope. Average to tasteless is the best way to describe them.
Tried my friends lettuce with chicken taco. Bland. Nothing exceptional to report about.
The 2 Korean beef soft tacos were good. But I wouldn't order it again. It wasn't out of this world memorable. I'd much rather go across the street to Ban Mi boys (their kalbi beef tacos are out of this world!)
Tried a sampling of my friends fried chicken. Yup. Average at best.
Glad I tried it. Won't be returning. That's off my bucket list."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, as korean restaurants are a dime a dozen in this area. After a Volleyball game, my team and I, (mostly korean) decided to give this place a try. Only do it if your into mediacore and overhyped food, and ghastly atmosphere. they really gotta focus on their concept....Korean Cowboys? I think the only thing Cowboy related was the Sawdust Chicken. 

We Ordered a round of drinks, all were from tap and the regular coors and canadians were not available. You do have somersby on Tap, with a soju somersby mixer combo which was actually quite good and interactive. on to the food...

kimchi fries. i didn't know if they were fries, or slivers of potato. the dishes were fantastic, whats in them, i was a little bit confused. it was over bearing with the sauce and I didn't see any kimchi. (and i eat a lot of kimchi)

sawdust chicken. where to start. The garnishing with the vegetables and garlic flakes were actually really good. The chicken was over cooked and almost completely just batter. this ones a miss, good concept and good try though.

I don't remember what its called on the menu, but the spicy rice cake, or dukbokki was not up to par to other korean restaurants. poorly spiced and proportionately small, there was maybe 5 pieces of the rice cake and everything else was fillers of vegetables. 

I got recommended the Squid and Pear Anju. Gave it a shot. again, good attempt, but its not a homerun. the pear was fresh and fantastic, but the squid placed on top of the sliced pears (similar shape to the kimchi fries) with Chamkirum sauce was, a poor attempt to sweeten a korean classic. Live San Nakji. (live squid dish)

disappointing. they're gonna have to do a huge revamping of the menu and concept of their place, cause it just wasn't working. 

on a side note, their cheese corn, something you can't mess up, was delicious! the addition of peppers into their corn hot pan was actually a great treat. 

I will not, and cannot at the moment recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the lettuce wrap, saw dust chicken, fried pasta, mocha pork, kimchi fries and rice cakes. 
The lettuce wraps were just a mess to eat! Wish i went for the tacos.
Saw dust chicken has a good taste but chicken has more batter. 
Fried pasta $1 not worth the $1 i cant even eat 4pcs. 
Mocha pork was like a braised pork belly, cant taste much of the mocha. 
Kimchi fries were good. Sriracha aioli n kimchi. 
Rice cakes was almost like gnocchi. Pretty good. 

All in all food is ok and great for the price. But i dont feel like theres anything for me to come back for."}
{"text":"This place is like fusion of Mexican and Korean food.  The tacos which should be amazing.. just aren't.  They lack sauce/flavour and have too much cabbage.  The kimchi fries though are bomb so definitely give it a try.  I recommend that if you plan to come here to load up on carbs before a night of drinking then try the soju because you get a bottle for like $13 and it feeds 6-7 people 2 rounds of shots!  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on Thursday to try the half priced wings. We shared the squid appetizer, the rice cakes with cheese app, and we each ordered spicy butter wings with fries. The squid was a bit tough and a bit bland for my taste, but passable. The rice cakes were a spongy delight, especially since the sauce tasted like cheesy Chef Boyardee sauce - yum! And I totally loved the wings - crispy, vinegary, spicy and super saucy. Would definitely go back.

-1 star for slow service after we got our food."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have great food and of course my all time drink soju! But I wish they had more korean foods to offer, but its still good a place to go and chill with friends and prices aren't that bad!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, it was very nice inside. Well, nicer than I thought it would be. It is a typical sports bar atmosphere. They have tables for Korean barbeque, and more seating area upstairs. They seem to have a good selection of beer, spirits and wine. They have some Korean and Japanese beers such as Asahi, Hite and Sapporo. They have fruity sojus, yogurt soju and so-mac. We had already eaten dinner so, we got the day special, shucked oysters, and Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) from their Anju (appetizers or dishes that complement alcohol) menu.

Shucked oysters were small but they came with seven different types of sauces! The sauces were chili vinegar, sesame, tabasco, tangy, wasabi, coffee and miso. I liked chili vinegar, sesame and coffee. It was fun trying different sauces. KFC was such a disappointment. It was a piece of fried chicken breast with parsley, with some fries and pickled white radish. The fried chicken piece was crispy but it had too much skin and fat, and no meat. Kentucky Fried Chicken would have been a better option. 

Everything on the menu seemed quite pricey. G-Po (a dried fish snack) for $5. Really that cost like less than $0.5 in South Korea. A pitcher of any kind of beer for $20 unless specified. Some large sharing dishes were $29.99 and up. The food was okay and it was kinda pricey. The service was quick and friendly. Overall, it seems to be a good place to grab drinks and try something different. They do have very interesting sounding dishes on the menu, so I might try some of them if I'm here again."}
{"text":"Saw a picture of the Lettuce tacos and was like, must come check out this place!
Lettuce Wraps ($10.99 for mixed assortment)
We choose 3 different types of wraps: Korean beef, Spicy pork, and Chicken. If you choose all with one meat then it's $8.99. The chicken was meh, didn't have much flavor and wasn't tasty. I liked the spicy pork the most - had more flavor, and the spiciness added a nice kick. The korean beef was good too, was like bulgogi wrapped in lettuce. The wraps came in large pieces of lettuce, and actually 2 leafs per taco which was good since lettuce rips easily, it was nice to have 2 to add the thickness. A little too much lettuce overpowering the meat but I didn't mind it - more veggies!

Kimchi Fries ($5.99)
This was good. The fries were crispy, there was a fair amount of kimchi. Essentially it is just fries topped with kimchi, mayo and bbq sauce. All the ingredients were there but nothing outstanding about it, not heavy in flavors. Not sure why it was served on a skillet though since it wasn't sizzling at all.

Skillet Corn ($4.99)
This was truly a gimmick - but I love corn so I didn't mind having it. Essentially it is just corn cooked in butter and cheese melted on top. It's not fresh corn, probably canned corn too. It's traditional Korean bar food, a good snack to go with alcohol. 

Green Tea infused Pork ($5.99)
This seemed interesting when I saw it on the menu, but was disappointed. I didn't taste any green tea flavor at all. If anything it just tasted like spicy pork, nothing different than the spicy pork served in the lettuce wraps. It's served with picked radish, I assume you would use the slices to wrap the spicy pork. 

They had a really interesting cocktail menu - drinks named like Hello Kitty, Asian Sunrise, or an alcoholic drink with melona (a popular korean ice pop). 

Overall the food was ok, nothing special. This place is a nice bar to chill with a group of friends for drinks and snacks, not quite the dinner spot though."}
{"text":"Great if you're in the mood for bar food snacks or a unique tasting sampler experience!

Went here for Halloween and was intrigued with the name. 
Food was inexpensive although it came in small portions, it was great for sharing! You also kind of want to try a bunch of different things because the menu was so intriguing. If I was any hungrier I probably would've ordered a lot more too. 

I went with a group of 10-13 people and they provided good space for us even though we kind of separated a bit. A friend and I sitting together shared the following items:

-Green tea infused pork: I got a super spicy dish, which is great because I love spicy food but I almost wondered whether or not I got the wrong plate of food because the description was nothing like I expected (basil, green tea leaves and pork).Super tasty though and my second favourite out of the four things we got. Nothing scary about this dish if you're hesitant of what to order, just take heed of it being spicy.

-Kimchi fries: the crowd favourite! Seriously, if \"weird\" food combinations scare you, I highly doubt you'll hate this one. If you're unsure of what to order - get this. I hate kimchi (I believe it's pickled cabbage?) but I loved this dish. The \"fries\" are cute, stringy and thin. Completely unexpected of the normative fry. Didn't even see kimchi on the fries, which is great because that would've ruined it for me. The sauce on top (which was probably kimchi-inspired) tasted amazing. Great dish! 

-Hotdog stirfry: Nothing spectacular, Sweet Korean ketchup on some stir-fried onions and green peppers and hotdogs. Maybe this was underwhelming for me because my mom used to cook something similar, but still a good dish. 

-Squid and Pear: different. Tasted more like pear and sesame seeds. The squid wasn't overpowering, very subtle. It's good to try for the sake of trying, but wasn't my favourite of the bunch. 


 Also got a drink:
-Godiva White Chocolate, Mint & Soju: forgot the actual name but those are the ingredients. Never tried soju before but I know I love White Chocolate and Mint. Should've taken my waitress's advice and that it wasn't going to be a sweet alcoholic drink (which is what I was craving that night). Ended up giving it away because I found out I didn't like soju very much. A friend of mine did, so I gave it to him and he described it as very, very minty. This was the general consensus when people wanted to try sips. Not for me. 

Great place, people were nice, staff seemed knowledgeable and friendly. Another group actually caused a disastrous mess/spill beer and the waitress was calm, cool, collected and cleaned it up quickly without making a huge scene."}
{"text":"I ordered the kimchi fries and beef tacos in a lettuce wrap. The beef tacos were pretty good. The kimchi fries however, totally sucked. It tasted expired and the fries were burnt. At the end, all that was left was tiny burnt nibs. They barely gave us any regular long fries. I recommend getting kimchi fries from bahn mi boys. I didn't like the atmosphere either. I don't like bars/pubs very much and the booths are made for big crowds."}
{"text":"My initial 5-star review no longer holds true so here's the update:  the Soju is now cheaper at $15 (instead of $19), Sarah, the exceptionally friendly and pleasant server quit, but the biggest blow is that I no longer feel welcome.

They offer $1 an oyster on Wednesdays (initially after 5 PM, now after 7 PM) which I consider bait and switch, since they have \"run out\" even at 7 PM (start time), whereas restaurants usually buy enough to cover an evening's sales. Oysters are not served until happy hour ends and are not available any other day or time at any price.

The meat and especially seafood in the various rice bowls offered at lunch is next to non-existent.  The buns in the steamed bun burgers are more often than not, not steamed properly and have hard and cold areas.  The beer once was off-tasting and without so much as tasting it themselves I was told it was the glass that makes the beer taste \"different\".

I gave them the benefit of the doubt at least 3-4 times and even brought them customers, but the service got from bad to worse, including not bringing out oysters that I ordered, while customers around me received theirs, then when reminded about my incomplete order, saying they've run out. The staff remain friendly, sympathetic and even apologetic, so it's certainly not them.

Ultimately, they've gotten complacent, arrogant and downright rude, so there's no going back there."}
{"text":"I love their atmosphere that makes me feel like I am in Shinchon or Hongdae. They have various draught beer so my hubby tried 3 different ones and loved all. Their Don Katzu was huge! different name on the menu, I don't remember exactly. Koink..something.. anyway very crispy!! I will come back, definately."}
{"text":"Yup, I came back to this place today however, for lunch this time. 

Their lunch menu fell short compared to their dinner menu but, it did make it easier for me to decide. We ordered the Soju Combo to start off, the classic korean soju with yogurt split between the 3 us. Pretty good deal for 21 bucks!!
As for food, we ordered 3 Pork Tacos along with another 3 Beef Tacos and Wings with the sweet and tangy sauce. Without a doubt, these tacos were AMAZING. Pretty cute, how their menu even warns you that it'll get messy. I mean, what is a taco if it's not gonna get messy? Both pork and beef tacos were tender paired with fresh veges, a scribble of spicy sauce and a sweet yet tangy sauce to complete it.
So for the wings...first off, please do not inhale deeply as this vinegary-fume will sting your olfactory nerves. My friend warned me but I didn't listen; did her mistake and there was my consequence. Of course, my other friend didn't listen either so she suffered as well. (No wonder we're all friends, haha!) Despite the harsh vinegary fume, it did delivery its sweet and tanginess and I liked how the wings were lightly battered. Oh, it came with a side of soft fries as well; they tasted just as good as crispy fries. 

I wish they would have a bit more on their lunch menu though such as noodles or another category aside from just burgers, tacos and rice bowls. Overall, service was exceptional. Server was very attentive and accomodating. Yet again, I am a happy customer!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few tapas and all dishes were very well done. The names of the dishes will surprise you a bit and when you try them, you may be surprised again (in a good way). Super affordable, about $4-6 for tapas style dishes, other places would normally charge twice (or more) for the same amount/quality.

All the servers were really nice, but it did take a while to take orders, fill up on drinks and get the bill."}
{"text":"It's an OK pub with Korean-Western fusion food. We had the Corn Cheese Skillet and the Kimchi fries. 

The corn wasn't all that special, and the Kimchi fries could have used more actual kimchi, and the fries were kind of burned, and there were lots of small pieces so it wasn't as easy to eat. 

The staff is OK but we weren't checked on very often, maybe just once after we got our food, and it was not a busy night. 

I could see this being a cool place to hang out with friends, there are lots of TV's so it's a cool place to watch sports, but date and I thought it was just average. 

I'd say their comparable, Han Ba Tang at Yonge-Sheppard is much better."}
{"text":"Had the wings (can't remember which ones) but they were fantastic. Place was dead on a Sunday. Waiter said business was slow."}
{"text":"Really good wings. Not as big as I expected them to be but well worth it on half price wing meal on Thursdays"}
