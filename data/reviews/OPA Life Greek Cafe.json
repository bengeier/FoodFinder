{"text":"As I was eating I was surprised at the relatively low star count. My food was delicious and promptly served and the wait staff was kind enough to answer all my questions. They also serve six beers on tap, coffees and desserts. I also would like to try some of their new breakfast menu! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First time here!! Delicious Greek food. I had the Chipotle Humus and Greek Fries. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very beautiful place. Clean with a nice view of the garden. The employees seem genuine with good service! The pizza I ordered was fresh and full of flavor! I am definitely coming again and I will bring friends!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Outstanding good and fast friendly service. A must visit when in Tempe. :-)"}
{"text":"Horrible food claiming to be Greek. Gyro tasted like pure beef with bad seasoning. Spanakopita was all cheese with a little spinach. Soggy calamari. Thumbs down. Should have gone to JR next door."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the salmon Greek salad and they were delicious! Very good sized as well. Will come back next time we visit Glendale. It was especially nice to sit outside."}
{"text":"First off, the food here is always delicious and the Greek fries are amazing.  However, it's a real classless move to have a \"special event\" menu with a 10-20% markup just because a hockey game is occurring. We came in just to order food (not go to a game) as we sometimes do and were a little peeved to see the \"special event\" menu. The kicker was that by the time we were finishing our food and the game traffic had subsided, incoming customers were getting the regular menu. Lame.  If we do come back, we'll be insisting on ordering from the regular menu."}
{"text":"The staff at the counter was nice and the food was mediocre. The main thing that killed the entire experience was that we arrived at 8pm (their hours are 6am to 9pm) and by 8:20, when we went for a refill, they had shut the entire soda machine down and were stacking chairs. When we wanted a refill they had to actually put they nozzles back on the soda machine to allow us to get a refill.  I think you need to at least stay open the hours posted on your door, and not rush the people who just paid to eat at your restaurant out the door. We were the only people eating when we went, and although the server was friendly, you need to stay open the hours you say you will. No one wants to eat while the place is being shut down. If you want to close early, you need to say so."}
{"text":"We came here on a cold rainy night.  Sat right next to the fire pit.   She ordered a greek chicken salad I go the greek salmon salad.  Both tasted great and the greens and veggies were nice and fresh.  The chicken had a much larger portion than the salmon which is the only reason why I gave this 4 stars.  I will def be back very interested in trying out this place or lunch."}
{"text":"Aghhh, why the high reviews?  Are they friends of the owners ? Do they not know quality Mediterranean food ? I dont get it !!  However I love their floor ! Thats the best part of the restaurant..... We went yesterday for lunch since we were stuck on the highway in some bumper to bumber traffic and we decided to get off and get something to eat !  It was a regrettable experience....FIRST ~You stand in line and look at the menu above peoples heads that are sitting down just underneath it (VERY ODD and UNCOMFORTABLE) . So you order at the counter,they give you a number and you find a table. You grab your table and sit and wait, and wait and wait some more as you listen to one of the employees yell at probably her step children (she is either Greek or Caucasian and the poor girls were African American , she appeared to be the evil stop mom or foster mom who made these 2 young girls (probably pre teens) clear off the tables and sweep while she talked to a friend who came in and yelled at them for everything ( encouragment when they made a mistake or gratitude after asking them to do anything~ stupid bi$!&, if I wasnt a changed person she would have definitely remembered me). I cant stand people who treat children as little slaves. Anyways the food probably took over an hour to come to our table, everyone around us was complaining and I even heard one of the guys who worked there tell a customer sorry, you ordered grill food and it usually takes 30 minutes to make AND we are already behind 30 minutes.....now at this point if we hadnt paid by now, we would have walked out but unfortunately we did so we had to wait.....AND we gave a tip at the very beginning....I hate this option!   Food finally comes and it was awful, the worse falafel balls I ever had . Hummus was very bland and they wanted to try and tell me that their salad dressing was vegan but it was white....when asked what it was made out of they said its Italian and balsamic mix.....ummm no....its not supposed to be white and creamy....even though they insisted they couldn't tell me what was exactly in it or bring me the ingredient list.  The only salvagable thing were there crispy fries. With the quality of food not sure how they will remain open.... Just an awful experience overall....."}
{"text":"Amazing service, exquisite food, perfect location. Highly recommended. Baklava cheesecake completely original, and quite delicious. Opa Life Greek Cafe is a must try."}
{"text":"Skip the line for US Egg. Opa has fantastic coffee and breakfasts. For dinner the club is an oversized tasty choice."}
{"text":"We had the Mediterranean pizza and the gyro pita with Greek salad. Both were excellent dishes. The ingredients were fresh and the portions were a good size for the price. The had fast, friendly service and the restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was there for the first time today. Was very pleased with the food and the generous portions. My mother and I split the Greek Gyro pita . It came with a Greek salad and I ordered a side of the vegetables. We ended up having food to take home. Also tried one of their signature ice coffees which was really good. Will have to go back next time and try the Mediterranean Moscow Mule which looks delicious! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We visit here regularly! One of the best Greek salad. I usually have my food accompanied with nice choice of draft IPA"}
{"text":"Great Food, location and fun!  If you love lamb, they know how to prepare it here!  We had some of there combo plates and everything was authentic and delicious!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love greek food and this place definitely satisfied my craving! Everything came out quick and had great flavor. I loved the Merlot too, one of the best I've had. The patio is beautiful and has a beautiful fire pit & nice heaters to keep you warm in the winter. I will definitely give this restaurant more business."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last Saturday with my boyfriend, it was his first time there and I had been there before. He really liked it and the second time around for me made it clear that this place doesn't mess around! Clean and welcoming environment, friendly and fast service and excellent food!   We had their gyros with Greek fries, fries topped with feta, lemon and olive oil. It was so delicious! Gyro meat was plentiful, juicy and savory. For dessert, we had their Baklava cheesecake! I have never tasted something so heavenly! Creamy, rich cheesecake with Baklava toppings, honey, nuts and whipped cream. If nothing else, go just for dessert! Awesome, family friendly place."}
{"text":"Costomer service was great over the top with appreciation for visit. Will come again a lot of food for the good price."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing good as usual.  Chicken souvlaki is so tender.  Lots of food to share or take home."}
{"text":"Horrible service! First, they charged me for kids meal even it's says FREE, they quickly made the rule the meal for kids 10 & under. There was no note for kids age. Second, in to go order I missed canollis I paid for. When I asked for my cannolis they bring one instead two. Finally, at home I realized they messed with my order, I found gyros packed instead of grilled chicken I ordered. What a mess business!!!! No come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, fantastic prices, and great service. Perfectly located in the heart of the action, this place rocks!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Mediterranean restaurant at the Westgate. Awesome food, fresh and full of flavor: I had the Aegean Club and salad, nice work to the kitchen team. The entire staff was equally impressive, Jey and Damon were very personable and created a welcoming, fun environment for every customer. They also have ample indoor and outdoor patio seating to enjoy the year round AZ weather. Be sure to stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food. Live entertainment was a bonus!!! Must try baklava cheesecake. It's the best ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and it lived up to the hype.  The Gyro was loaded with meat and the Greek fries are yummy. Nice wait staff and very clean.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, there happened to be a live jazz band playing at the same time. It created a fun atmosphere. The greek food was really good. We had the beef kabob and falafel sandwich which were both tasty. The quality of the food was great however the quantity could have been more. The fries were awesome! The restaurant seems to attract a lot of older people but this could have been because of the jazz night. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing Food. If you are visiting in the area you should check it out. Thank you Opa Life"}
{"text":"I think this place is under new management cause service today was excellent. the manager( I think it was) kept coming to ask if we needed anything he was very nice. we  will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Being 100% Greek from Chicago, I don't get a taste of home very often. I have tried numerous other places to satisfy my cravings and a touch of homesickness. This by far was the most top notch experience I have had in my 6 years of living away from my family.   I decided to look on their menu at home as they just opened down the street from me, and was delighted by their selection. When my boyfriend and I walked in the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the girl behind the counter. She asked if we had been in before and upon us answering no, went through all the specials. I ordered the OPAtizer combo, and he ordered the gyro pita with greek fries. The portions were incredible, we definitely took leftovers home!   The food was delicious, and we were checked on several times. All of our needs were catered to, and we even managed to find some room to enjoy a very authentic galektobouriko (greek custard with phyllo dough)   We even noticed the back of the waitress's shirt said koukla, which means doll in Greek. All in all a top-notch choice that I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their food is delicious, great taziki and fresh ingredients all around. More importantly, every time I come by I get excellent service - always asking me what more I want/need. They have live Jazz some nights, I think every Monday. Great stuff! Clean, refreshing service, delicious and affordable food."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! It was clean and the food was very good. My servers name was Sydney and she was very pleasent our entire visit!  :)"}
{"text":"Incredibly affordable, amazing food in large portions, and an incredibly friendly environment/working staff. If you go to the aquarium be sure to eat here, the manager will give you 15% off. One of the nicest restaurants I've been to in a long time and you can get a great meal for under $10. If I lived closer to this area I would go here every day."}
{"text":"I got the chicken souvlaki here for lunch. Also, I read a review on the fries, I decided to splurge and get those as well. Everything tasted clean and fresh, but the tzaziki sauce on the gyro greatly lacked flavor, as well as the chicken. The fries were basic as well. I would try it again if I was in the area and see if the salads or maybe pizza are better."}
{"text":"Opa deserves 5 stars for the menu choices.  Food is a bit overpriced but delicious.  I have lunched there 4 times and felt I got my dime's worth.  I wish that they include more etnic dishes.  I do have my favorites."}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast at the (new?) OPA Greek restaurant...  I had the Bistro Breakfast Panini and the little one had Strawberry Ricotta Panini.  I asked them to hold the apples on mine, and it came out perfect.  Had to try a bit of the strawberry, to because it looked so good (maybe next time I will get that!!).  I used to come to the old dirty express, but even though the food was great the place was nasty.  Now this place is like brand new.  I couldnt even belive it was the same place!!!    I will be back to sit on the patio with a glass of wine and for some people watching and a humus plate.  The owner was so friendly and gave me a ticket to have a coffee on him next time i come.  Only complaint, I would rather have a burger on him next time I come!!"}
{"text":"It's not the Big Fat Greek Express anymore which is depressing.  No more pulled lamb sandwiches .  Still has a decent happy hour if you're looking for a Greek Blue Moon at least, and the Greek fries are still pretty good."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Very very rude people. That was my first and last time... Another customer asked for a clear cup and the employee was fine to give it to her. But when I asked immediately after, she was like well noo..ehh okay (with eye rolling and attitude). Then wouldnt give me a lid \"because she had to go get them\" so after waiting 10mins I asked a different employee. He went and got me a lid, which was right behind her a foot away! After 30 mins I finally got my drink. DONT RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Food and setting are great. They also have great music nights, especially when Josh Bierman plays. A really fun evening out with good food and good friends. Oh, and their breakfast is really good too!"}
{"text":"I send out for lunch often, and today my cousin suggested Opa.  The gyro he brought back for me was one of the best ones I've ever had.  I love Greek food and haven't had it since moving here three years ago... I now have a new favorite place... and it's close... and it's reasonably priced!  A great find."}
{"text":"Our first time here and ordered the oppa life  combo  excellent!!!   Each person's table was full of the lights we want to come back and try.  You order your food at the counter get a number and pick your spot.   the owner  and staff very very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Just visited here for the first time last week and overall it was pretty enjoyable. The food was great, I ordered a gyro with their seasoned fries, and apparently they offer $1.00 street tacos for taco tuesday - I ordered the gyro verson. The atmosphere was nice, nothing too crazy or busy, and it was nice to see that they offer live local music on a regular basis.  The only reason this place gets a 4/5 instead of a 5 is because the service was neither fast nor friendly. The food came out  quick enough, and there was plenty of it, but the ordering process was a bit of a mess. The cashier had called us over to take our order and as we walked up to her register she decided to take a long phone order. From there, she disappeared off to speak with another staff member. When she did get around to taking our order and I ordered the $5.99 lunch combo, she neglected to mention the fact that the lunch combo was no longer a deal they were offering, thus doubling the cost of my meal. She then had trouble figuring out why my friend and I were confused about the pricing, so she clearly was either very new or just doesn't pay attention to what's going on in her workspace, as there was literally a sign behind her head that read \"$5.99 lunch combo.\"  Regardless, the manner in which the whole thing went down was more than a little irritating, as she wasn't very polite to begin with.  Aside from that though, the food was great and it seems like a great place to see some live music! Like I said, questionable service, but since you deal with cashiers rather than servers, it's an easier pill to swallow, as you don't have to continually interact with the employees."}
{"text":"I love Greek food, and was excited to come here, but quickly realized it was not actually greek food. For anyone who has experienced true Greek cuisine, I would not recommend. The greek salad is made with romaine lettuce, and the blonde girl texting while she checked me out at the register, stated that what I was looking for was the village salad (not even close). I was also charged for a meal that I did not receive, my Gyro was supposed to come with fries, and I just got a $9 Gyro. I had taken my food to go, so my mistake there. The Gyro came with cheesy shredded lettuce, diced tomato, and poorly cut red onions for the prices they charge here. I almost drove my food back to the restaurant, and I have never done that before..."}
{"text":"Shit service bland food and overpriced... Came for breakfast  on sunday with like 6 people in the cafe ordered 2 eggs hashbrowns and an english muffin, took 39mins... F this place"}
{"text":"Food was actually decent. Never really had authentic Greek food so for me, it was good. HOWEVER, the staff is pretty bad. Not the the whole staff but the majority. Nobody at the front knew the Kids menu. Had to goto the back and ask someone. This all due to their being no kids menu listed on the paper handout menu. So as I waited for my food and looking at the stuff in glass display the girl working the register was gossiping about her co-workers to some dude she was trying to flirt with. Looks at me and gives me the dirtiest look and turns to the guy and says \"I'll tell you in a min\". Looks to me and stares haha. Whatever. Food took forever. Nobody gave us a number placard to put on our table so they didn't know where to take our food. Maybe later on down the road we will try it again. Oh, Dr. Pepper was awful. Probably not their fault though."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at Westgate! I don't know why more people haven't discovered this place, it's one of the less crowded restaurants in the center but has great food and wonderful outdoor seating perfect for people watching. I had the lamb kabob, the meat was tender, flavorful and plentiful. The house Greek salad is also delicious. My dining partner enjoyed the gyro and pita. We shared an amazing baklava. It should be noted this is not a full serve restaurant, you order at the counter, get your own beverages and silverware but they bring the food at to your table."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is great & free music on weekends!   Their Greek fries are out of this world, love the gyros. They make the best Lemon Orzo soup! Have never gotten a bad meal."}
{"text":"The place was a lil busy and the waitress was extremely helpful and answered questions I had about the menu. I have to tell you the food was amazing. I dont get out as much as I would like to as my wife is disabled and we have 4 kids and finances are hard. I am going today after work to get food for wife that she has been craving. I definately recommend this place to all who hasnt tried yet."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! They have the best calamari Greek salad ever. It's a bit overpriced but they have an offer on groupon so it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience I ever had at a restaurant. I can't tell you how the food was because I never got mine. It actually looked good, but 30 minutes after placing my order, I went back up to check on it. After about five minutes, it was determined that my order was given to someone else. No worries.  I said I'll wait. But literally 30 minutes later I still had no food. I checked again. It had been ready for awhile but the girl I was working with just didn't care to follow up on an already bad situation. At that point, I asked for a refund and was coldly taken care of. No offer of any way of making up for the 1hour plus, I waisted sitting there being ignored. Bad,  bad customer service. That girl should not be serving anyone."}
{"text":"I expected much better based on the reviews. The wife and I stopped for lunch, and food was barely adequate. 4 dolmades for $10 is a bit high, but if they were good I wouldn't have cared as much. They were dry and mostly tasteless, the grape leaves weren't prepared properly and they were tough and chewy. They were a good size, and the lemon sauce was good, but overall they missed the mark. The gyro meat was scarce, gray and bland, it wasn't anywhere as good as Phoenicia in Tempe or Gilbert. The Greek fries had parmesan cheese and not feta cheese on them. They're supposed to be Greek fries, not Italian fries. I won't be back ---  go to Phoenicia instead."}
{"text":"Good food and service! I have had lunch here twice and enjoyed it both times. I can say they are pricey. Up to $20 with a appertizer and a beer for lunch. The portions match the price but to much food for one person. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Location is amazing, it was empty for a while and was waiting for someone to take advantage of it. Decor and setup is great, especially the patio.   Food was decent, I had the Gyro and Greek salad. No complaints on the gyro, you should definitely give it a try. As far as the salad, it was good, but it didn't seem like a \"Greek\" salad, tasted more like a Ceasar with Kalamata olives and feta.   I also had a latte which wasn't too bad.   Baklava is great, by the way."}
{"text":"I went there for one reason, the music. I had been very happy to find a venue with jazz in the area. When the opportunity finally came to visit, it was extremely disappointing.. This is no music venue. The band is tucked into one corner of an L shaped restaurant, meaning at least half the restaurant cannot see them. The ambiance of the restaurant is a step-up from fast food but not much. There was a great deal of noise coming from people talking, coming in, going out, ordering, etc. This is ridiculous if you are a music fan. Also, no table waitress service, you have to go up to the counter to order, not only for food but drinks as well. Talk about a mood buster! Bright lighting as well destroys any possible atmosphere. For nights when they have music, there should be table service. Someone there needs to put their thinking cap on! Finally, the food - I didn't have any Greek food items because I wasn't familiar with them so a hamburger was ordered instead. It was like ground lead. Dry, dense, with no flavor at all; it must have been sitting there for hours before I came along. The Music is a good idea but now they have to change a few things. One, table service; two; put the band in the middle not hidden in the corner so only a limited number of people can see them;  three, Have people enter at the ends of the restaurant, this would free up space for more tables in the middle; Four, can the noise. Either become a restaurant where jazz is displayed or install a jukebox."}
{"text":"This place has the best falafel ever! I used to have a favorite gyro place in Avondale but now this is my new go to! The pita is nice and fluffy and their portions are huge. I recommend the greek fries,  not sure what sauce they put on aside from having the sprinkles of feta on top, but it is amazing! Nice and crispy fries all the time and oh, getting to drink with a nice outdoor patio is great too!"}
{"text":"I came to this place before and I thought the gyro was really good. I just ordered on Uber eats the same gyro I got last time and it honestly wasn't the same. There was too much lettuce and not enough onion at all! everything just tasted different than before. I honestly think they rushed to get my order to Uber so that could be it. At the restaurant it was great! Even the salad, as for ordering it to go through Uber eats it's eh"}
{"text":"Yummy food!!! We have never had a bad meal here. Everything tastes fresh and cooked to order. Our new go to place over that \"other\" pita place. The only reason it is a 4 & not a 5 star- they always seem short staffed and you have to wait to order or get to go boxes. But with that being said, the girl was very friendly, didn't appear stressed, and handled the situation rather well.  We also like the music they play."}
{"text":"just a suggestion for their hot pitas and that is to wrap them.  The meat sauce causes the pita to rip and all the meat and vegetables fall out.  Other then that, staff was nice and friendly!!!"}
{"text":"At first I thought the meal would be slightly overpriced until the food actually arrived--I had the Chicken Caesar Wrap--and it was huge (& delicious) plus it came with a healthy & fresh-tasting side salad. I also wish the tea wasn't behind the counter, but whatevs--I enjoyed eating there and will definitely be back (& am looking forward to my leftovers!) Also, I had the half Baklava... was so good I might go back sometimes for that dessert alone!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of standard Greek cuisine and a few local items. Gyro pita isn't a traditional roll but tastes very good. The tzatziki sauce is really good.   Don't know what some people are saying about service, mine was impeccable. FYI place isn't a sit down or fast food place but a hybrid. Order at counter then food is brought out."}
{"text":"Stopped there today with friends. Food was just OK and very expensive. I had a gyro in a pita and it was tasteless. It was served open faced and looked more like a Mexican tostada than a Greek gyro. You should be able to bend the pita bread in order to eat your gyro like a sandwich and this was impossible. Not because there was so much meat on the pita - it was because there was so much lettuce.There are many other restaurants near by that serve tastier Greek food so I would suggest you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Do you like delicious Greek food? Do you dig listening to fantastic bands on a Friday or Saturday night? Do you like to be served by gorgeous waitresses and friendly fellas who all listen closely to your order, make sure you are taken care of throughout your meal that greet you with a smile. This is the place to go then!"}
{"text":"We were heading to odysea and starving from our long drive from Flagstaff. One of our party is vegetarian and we were excited to see the options from this restaurant. While we were Googling we saw a Groupon for it so that was a bonus.  When we got to the location it was hard to find because the sign just says Pangea. The website has this location's information on it so we finally made it. Two of our party were walking ahead of us while trying to find the restaurant so they got to it first and were seated. The waiter refused to give them water cups for the other three of us until we got there. Not too big of a deal but kind of weird. The weirdness kept coming. We waited a long time for the waiter and we were a little stressed because we had a time entry ticket to the aquarium. It was our own fault for not leaving ourselves enough time, so again, not too big of a deal. He finally came and got our drink order, but refused to stick around to get our meal order. All of us were either ready to order since we have been sitting there for a while, or had questions about the menu since it wasn't too clear about what was vegetarian. He was in a huge rush for whatever reason. We gave each other looks but still were not too upset, just weirded out. He came back with our water cups which were just little plastic disposable cups, strange for what appeared to be a nice restaurant. Then we tried to ask him about the Groupon since it stated it was for four people and we had a party of five. He kept repeating that it would be taken off of the bill and wouldn't let us finish our question. Just kept repeating the same thing over and over, talking over us. He then decided he had to go wait on his other tables so he took off again. The Groupon was not worth the waiter's rudeness. We left and went next door to the restaurant that overlooks the dolphin area. Luckily Groupon has an exchange policy and we had a lovely lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"My first time here and based on the deliciousness and quality of the food, I will definitely be back. I took my food to-go and would love to go back and dine in with my family because the atmosphere was great. The service was incredible, as well. My food was not ready when I got there and I could tell the staff really cared about my wait time and made me feel appreciated. 5 stars in my book and I eat out 5x/wk and at some very nice establishments...I am a food and resaraunt snob and this place is as good as they get!"}
{"text":"First time eating her but this may be my new favorite fairly quick Greek place.  Just had lunch.  I had the half size chicken kebob, which comes with 2 sides.  I had the Greek salad and the vegetables.  Very generous portions and very good and both had cheese grated on top.   They also have several very nice iced teas (all non-sweetened) including my favorite green tea/pomegrante.  I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Went with a big group. They treated our group pretty well!"}
{"text":"1st time was great service. Husband of the owner was super nice and the experienced barista was sweet as well. Prices were pretty outrageous for a place you walk up and order from but the great service and food brought us back.  2nd time the service was poor. The lady seemed to be hating life and didn't offer a single smile or pleasantry. I paid 14 bucks for a plate of chicken, rice, veggies and a pita which I wouldn't mind if it were a sit-down-and-get-served restaurant but you walk up and order and then they call your name (or bring it to you if they aren't too busy).   Bottom line: Good food and nice atmosphere but won't be back due to prices and unfriendly service. I would be willing to return if my plate were 8 bucks instead of 14."}
{"text":"The dolmathes were extremely hard. The balsamic vinegar on the pizza salad is too sweet. All of the glass doors being left open made it feel like you were right next to the smokers because of how strong the cigarette smoke drifted in. One waitress was pleasant. Hopefully they can improve."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING - and the people who work here are gorgeous, which is never a bad thing.   Eat here NOW!!!"}
{"text":"First time great portion size, good quality, healthy choices and fast service at lunch!"}
{"text":"We were at a shop close by and decided to drop in with the family for lunch. We got 3 gyros and Greek fries and a Greek salad. So bomb! We will definitely come back. All of us were pleasantly surprised and the staff was really sweet and presentable. 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"Health code violation.  I went to the counter to ask for a fork, a young man was wiping silverware with a dirty looking, raggedy blue towel.  He wiped a fork with this rag and handed it me!!!  I was shocked!"}
{"text":"ordered 4 gyro pitas, 3 greek fries, spanakopita and hummus platter to go. their tsatsiki sauce is the bomb.com.  the owner is so nice and always remembers us.  the foid is good but even if it was mediocre i would come back for that charm!  4 visits now and so far so good"}
{"text":"OMG just tried a new dish on the menu called The Hercules. Nirvana. So flavorful and delicious! This is my first time at this restaurant but if this dish is indicative of the other menu fare I will definitely be back. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The Restaurant is open with a nice patio and everything looks like it is kept very clean."}
{"text":"Food is good. Customer service horrible! It always seems like your an inconvenience even though your inline paying for it. Weird!"}
{"text":"Well, I have been here a few times now. I have to say the first time I really liked it. This time, I got my food to go. The staff is great, they explain everything about the food when asked. It is also very clean in here. Bathrooms as well. I got the food to go and we really liked it. Except for the salad. The Salad was almost $15.00, It was full of spines of the lettuce. You cannot eat that. If you were desperate and that is all there was you could but, not when you are paying that much for a salad. I was extremely disappointed in that fact. The rest of the food was good, but it is really a bummer when this happens. This is just sheer laziness, to add this into the salad.  Other than that the food was great and on the weekends they have live music and such.  The Lamb Souvlaki was great!  If you are unfamiliar with the area ,you really have to search. It is on the south side of the road and hidden among a few other shops and restaurants. You can park and walk a little if you have too. It is in the middle of the complex."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Greek cuisine I've had in Arizona in the last 15 years I've lived here!  And I should know because I'm a Greek woman from Chicago who had eaten at the very best there, and I'm a pretty damn good cook myself. The food at Opa Life is the closest I've found to my own cooking and at a reasonable price too. We were there last night and I had the lamb souvlaki with fries, my husband had the gyros salad with fries. My lamb was seasoned, marinated and cooked to perfection and the fries were crisp, hot and delicious.  My husband's gyros was cooked the correct way, on a spit, not fried on a griddle, which is the cheap and lazy way mist restaurants here cook it. We met the owner, Adam, who was a fabulous host. He was genuinely wanting to make sure everyone got great service which is what I would expect, and the wait staff was wonderful too. This was a great experience and I'm looking forward to my next meal there and also visiting some of the other Opa Life locations"}
{"text":"Only thing that can be a bother is standing in line to order.  Otherwise, their food is excellent, especially the traditional Mediterranean type of food.  The Greek salads with balsamic vinegar are all excellent and make up a side dish to many entrees.  The staff are very, very nice girls.  Prices are midrange.  Not very inexpensive but not a bank breaker.  Music 5 nights a week, often top-flight jazz.  It's a very, very hospitable place.  You should try it!"}
{"text":"Delicious gyros, great price, lots of meat and messy. Nice atmosphere, fun to go on their jazz music night!"}
{"text":"The food was great, except that it was served with human hair in it. My family and I ordered a Greek style pizza, Greek Fries and Hummus and while the flavors and concepts where delicious we collectively found  5 pieces of hair in our dishes. Looked back to the kitchen and to no surprise none of the men were wearing hair nets. Ew."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The people were rude and I waited forever for my food even though the place was empty. And the tables were all sticky."}
{"text":"They had a big sign outside that kids eat free. Not true. I kid per adult eats free but their kids meals don't include a drink and fries are extra. The kids pizza clearly came out of a plastic wrap and was microwaved. It was disgusting. The burgers were dry and old tasting. And the place seemed like it tried to be high class but it was not. No one was helpful or nice, they didn't show you where the drinks were or the crayons for the kids coloring paper menu. I had to walk around finding everything myself with 3 tired kids. It was low quality food and service."}
{"text":"Love,  love this place!  We've been a few times now and have ordered out as well.  I get a craving for gyros once in a while and they make a bomb diggity one!  Staff is always friendly and courteous. Westgate, since opening has had a slew of places that don't last but I'm sure this place will become a staple!"}
{"text":"After a long hot day here I wanted something fresh and delish, I found that here. There are a lot of choices for food in this plaza but I am SO glad we decided to give this place a try. I'm really picky and usually find something wrong with something...I had NO complaints about anything. I had the grilled shrimp and lamb plate with Greek salad and rice. Every bite I took was better than the last. I highly recommend this place. The staff was very courteous and accommodating to all of our substitutions, we were checked on and felt very well cared for while we were here."}
{"text":"Super happy we stopped by tonight. Got a gyro platter for 12.95 a beer and a glass of wine (total around 20$) . Signed up for awards and the awesome guy that helped us gave us 20% off. On a home game, Saturday night, we got our food before we even grabbed our number. Food was warm and delicious. Definitely coming again for the friendly and quick service!"}
{"text":"Opa life has a very laid back environment, with exceptionally friendly and accommodating service! The only place it falls short for me personally is the authenticity or exotic flavor of the food. I usually hit up mom and pop type greek places around town, so I've come to expect more of a native taste. I ordered a Gryo and was a little disappointed with the lack of tzatziki, which is, in my opinion, one of the signature flavors of a gyro. If you're looking for a great atmosphere with super friendly service, here ya go! But if you're in the mood for a more traditional greek flavor experience, look else where, like Flaming Kabob."}
{"text":"Great greek food and a reasonable price. Ate at the Scottsdale location. Owner was here and very friendly. As server was delevering my food he noticed they didnt have my salad and immediately got it. Staff are friendly and attentive. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Holy moly. I wish that was all I had to say. This place is flipping amazing. I got thr basic gyro and the Greek fries. So phenomenal. They came out at lightening speed, you get a huge portion for a decent price and the gyro meat is just delicious! Applause for Opa!!"}
{"text":"Worst Greek Restaurant Ive ever been to! How can u screw up a gyro? Well come to Opa Greek Cafe and find out! Who soaks there gyro meat in a vat of broth, this restaurant! Gyro came out soggy and bland... give up Opa Greek  Cafe Greek food ain't your thing!"}
{"text":"Average Greek food, long wait.  Hopefully they will work the kinks out.  Food took a long time, and they don't seem prepared for crowds from the sporting events."}
{"text":"We tried for dinner, & enjoyed. Even our picky eater LOVED the chicken souvlaki. Today, we tried breakfast. Very tasty strawberry smoothie, based on how fast my child sacked it down. :-P I did manage to get a taste, & it was nice & refreshing. I tried the bacon paninni w/ bacon, egg, spinach, sun-dried Tomatoes. YUM!   I noticed one review commented on tea setup. That is now fixed & available for self serve."}
{"text":"Good food and quick service. Gyros were stuffed with meat and veggies. Wrap was tasty."}
{"text":"Was craving a gyro while at the aquarium and I wish I hadn't stopped here.  Worst Gyro I have ever had.  The meat was greasy and did not have that distinct gyro flavor.  Sauce tasted like Italian salad dressing."}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Healthy & Fresh! I hope when they get a little busier they will have servers and a specified cashier. I have a thing about the person handling cash then turning and preparing food. The owner, I assume, was such a nice guy, Very pleasant and helpful with our ordering.  Again, the food was fantastic!! Great choices for kids, with ice cream to boot! Great choice when your visiting the Aquarium....Or if you just want some yummy Greek food!!  Prices $$, very reasonable for the giant amount of food you are served!"}
{"text":"We are constantly on the lookout for great Greek food, we decided to try Opa one night while strolling Westgate and we were over the top excited to find such great food and service!! We probably ate there 3 times in the following two weeks and wished we had only tried it sooner!!  The Chicken Souvlaki is amazing, the grilled veggies have the best flavor!!  Himm, I think I may be headed there again after this review!!!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to the aquarium and decided to stop here. The food was delicious and staff really friendly!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and every time the service is great and the food is really awesome haven't had a bad thing here yet I had the lamb kebab tonight with two sides I chose to salads which is awesome because you don't have to have different sides like most places the lamb kebabs are seasoned very well full flavor the dressing on the Greek salad was okay a little Bland I think now they're baklava cheesecake is Heavenly definitely a place to come when you're at Westgate"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and every time have been fully satisfied.  Today I was served by Brad and asked him for well done Greek fries and they were perfect! The amount of meat they give you is enough to keep you fed for two meals!!!  The only problem I had was having to pay .50$ for refills...they should include at least one free.  My friend had the Greek salad and added the gyro meat and was only able to get thru one fourth of it before giving up!  Make sure you bring your appetite when you come here you won't be disappointed and you won't leave hungry!  Brad made sure our experience was phenomenal and he succeeded!  Tell Brad Joe sent ya!  Even if u don't,  you will be well taken care of!!!"}
{"text":"I had a Very Good Mediterranean salad and it has a very beautiful Ambience outside with the fire place"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for the first time tonight and were very impressed. We spoke with the owner and he was very friendly and involved with the service. Also, the cashier had great wine recommendations. Overall, the food was fast and fresh!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Souvlaki Kabobs are the best in the valley. Also thier Salmon Salad is top of the line. Jey, Emma, & Luis will give you 1st Class service. Tell them I sent you."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is on point. The food is excellent, the beer is cold, and the fire pit is warm (oh yea they have one!)"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere & AMAZING food. I would recommend Opa any day. Definitely becoming a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food and really pleasant/helpful staff. I am half Greek so my stadards for Greek food are pretty high. I ordered the meatball appetizer (Keftedes) and a side of veggies. I ordered my food to go but shortly after leaving I realized the meatballs were not how my grandmother makes them (in red sauce) so I went back in to ask for sauce. They only had pizza sauce but it was actually really delcious. Makes me want to go back and eat their pizza. Probably seemed like a strange request but the staff was really nice about it and gave me a generous portion which made a world of difference with the meatballs. Really enjoyed them. Very flavorful and juicy. The veggies were really good too (added some sauce on them as well.) I work close by and with not many options in the area its nice to have a place to get good quality food at a decent price. A little over $10 for both things."}
{"text":"Good size portions and clean environment. It can be a challenge to get the food out at the same time with a party over 2. Food is a little pricey and can be hit or miss depending on the day but it is nice to have an alternative to the typical fare at Westgate."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great food, great service.   I ordered a grill chicken plate with vegetables and  a salad and it was sooo tasty. I think It's the best grill chicken I have ever tried . You should try this place ..."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, although perhaps a bit overpriced for for a deli environment.  The wine selection is limited which would be fine if any one of them actually tasted good.  I tried a red wine the last time and it was quite warm.  The live music nights are fun and balance out what you pay for dinner, but why in the world keep all of the TV's on during performances?  People are there for the band/performers, not to watch sports on those evenings so it is distracting as well as rude to the singers and musicians."}
{"text":"Loved the meal here! Ordered the veggie delight pizza, veggie wrap with Greek side salad (balsamic vinaigrette). Kid's menu item was free and came with a kid's size cheese pizza! Plus they accommodated our allergies. The parmesan they gave us was fresh and even added in sides of ranch to dip the yummy crusts!!"}
{"text":"I extremely recommend this place. I haven't had a good gyro since being in Arizona until I found this place. I don't know about a lot of other people out there, but I can not stand soggy bread or pita! This place made sure to put your sauce on the side and to also have fresh veggies and tomatoes. Another positive was that we ordered from Phoenix, which is a pretty good drive from the restaurant itself. The driver from Uber eats I'm sure had a lot to do with it, but the food was still hot and fresh when it got to me. Fries are the bomb diggity! Haven't had fries like that since I lived in PA. Keep doing what you guys are doing!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery using GrubHub recently and everything I complained about after my first visit has been corrected.  Everything is delicious and as usual, the portions are huge.  It's hard to resist the urge to have them deliver every day."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was delicious.  Coffee was also delicious. Prices aren't too crazy. Decor is cute."}
{"text":"We didn't eat there but we stopped in to check it out and the girl at the front was so nice. She explained the menu too me and recommend some of the things she liked. She interacted with my 3 year old daughter while I looked over the menu. We were out for dinner but we are totally gonna come back for lunch one day. It was awesome to have a nice experience with a nice person. It doesn't happen very often! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Never tried this place before .. Came based on the four star review.  It was wonderful !  My hubby and I shared a Spanakopita appetizer, as well as a main dish.  The spanakopita was some of best I've ever had... We ordered a combo beef and chicken souvlaki, with the Greek fries  and rice as a side.   The chicken was so tender and full of flavor... The beef delicious and flavorful as well... Greek fries... An amazing blend  of flavors.., A real delight to your palate .   We were too full for dessert but will be back again!  OPA!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a late lunch one Friday afternoon. We had the fig mules. The owner/manager gave them to us at happy hour price even though it quite wasn't happy hour which was very nice. I ordered the cilantro jalapeño hummus as an appetizer. I think it is the best one I've had. I also ordered the berry feta salad. Whoever made it made my salad beautiful. I almost didn't want to eat it. I did though and it was fresh filled with fresh berries and chunks of feta. Next time I really want to try the baklava cheesecake."}
{"text":"Placed an order this morning to be picked up at 12:20pm. Arrived at 12:35 and had to wait until 12:40 for it to be ready. There were only two-four tables seated when I arrived, so I'm not sure why my salad took THAT long. And then there was MOLD on the feta cheese! My cheese was on the side, not touching any other food, and there was a huge splotch of mold on the cheese in the ramekin."}
{"text":"The food is good, the entertainment is alright and the service is ok. I like the place don't get me wrong  but sometimes the people singing suck and we just eat outside most of the time."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today and ordered a California specialty pita with a side of Greek fries. I loved everything! The place was very clean and the employees were very nice. I would definitely go back again with a friend for their food and awesome happy hour deals."}
{"text":"Great food and a welcoming staff! The staff can make or break your eating experience - this staff was wonderful and we will return."}
{"text":"Such delicious food for a very reasonable price, especially considering Westgate prices. Everything from the hummus to the burgers and pitas are scrumptious. There was a man who helped us while we were there and he was running around, trying to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal. I think this man was the owner because he was so, so nice and you can tell he took pride in this restaurant. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The owner of the restaurant was helping everybody, he was bussing tables, he was expediting orders and he greeted every person at the door."}
{"text":"Oh wow. To preface this, my wife doesn't like eggs, so we never really buy breakfast foods. Lunch/dinner menus need only apply.  Stopped in over the weekend craving Greek. I walked in as they were opening in the morning. I felt awkward asking, and (while I don't think it's protocol) they were accommodating, and cooked up both a Chicken Caesar & Opa Chicken wrap.  My wife enjoyed her side salad, but I just LOVED the Greek fries! We also shared a slice of their pumpkin cheesecake. We shall return, but hopefully after breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"Wow paid $16 for a gyro salad!!! The gyro was tasty and the portion size was big, but way overpriced for the salad in this atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the place to go before a Coyotes game at the Gila River arena.  The food here is consistently good and the staff has been always friendly.  For appetizers you can't miss the Greek Fries and Saganaki.  Our go-to meal here is the Chicken Souvlaki, veggies and rice. They obviously get busy before a Coyotes or Cardinals, so their menu is reduced on game days.  The Saganaki isn't available on those days, among other items.  Also, on days they have car shows at the entertainment district, you have a great view from Opa Life. On cooler dessert evenings, it's great to sit outside by their fire-pit and have a beer and a decision dinner."}
{"text":"Came here after Westgate Wednesday and paid $70 for some appetizers and a salad. The food was good, but over priced and overrated.  I would've given more stars except our food came in to-go boxes and a bag. When we approached the counter to ask for plates, they gave us empty to-go boxes and said that since we didn't order a meal, our food had to come in boxes. We looked around and saw plenty of people with appetizers on plates. It would've been ok if it was a mistake. We just wanted some plates to eat with. Then we felt rushed bc the employees kept coming to our table to take our napkins and ask us if we were done. The people were nice and welcoming at first, but some how the sevice just got worse the longer we were there. Don't think we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Clean and absolutely delicious. I had the lamb panini amazingly spiced and cooked to perfection. Not fatty at all. The potion of meat was hearty too. My father had a chicken sandwich which he loved. Didn't have any drinks but I liked the black tea selection as well. Yummy. I want to come back already"}
{"text":"Fantastic  place. Exceptional Customer service and great food. First time here and already my favorite place in Westgate."}
{"text":"Delicious wraps and salads! I've tried the Opa chicken wrap and the chicken souvlaki, both great! Good service as well. We'll definitely continue to go there."}
{"text":"Great food! Fresh and reasonably priced. Good comfortable atmosphere and nice people service. Had the Gyro and Greek fries.  Side Greek salad was fresh. Just the right amount of sauce and cheese."}
{"text":"Amazing! Staff..impressive! Service..impeccable. . I will be a regular here! Don't question to stop here. The hummus is awesome! Pita bread warm and delicious! This place is no joke nor are their servers."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a lunch meeting with clients. Had never been here before and wasn't sure what to expect. Menu signs when you walk in a little awkward to view unless your 6'4\". Very high and not a lot of room in line to try and see them.   Ordered the gyro wrap and it was good. I did not expect that it wasn't in the normal gyro bread but just a soft tortilla shell. The loaded frys that came with it were amazing. Always get the house frys that will come with feta cheese and a dressing that will make your taste buds jump.  Service was fast and the place was very clean. Would try this location again just to see what else those frys will go good with."}
{"text":"This place was great, but be warned... the portion sizes are HUGE! I had the Greek Burger and Zesty Lemon Fries... it was enough to feed like 3 people, I could not finish it. Overall though, very cool spot and it was PACKED with all kinds of people, so that says it all right there."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised.   I had the Greek omelet and it was outstanding!   Great service and affordable."}
{"text":"So I have been to this place two times so far and once for take out. Gotta say I can't wait to go back.  I am not sure if it's good timing on my part but every time I have been to Opa Life there has been live music and good service as well. My wife and I both order pitas to share and have not been let down yet. I also recommend the incredible Greek fries.  On my last trip I tried the Greek coffee which was great and not too bitter and strong like I was expecting. If I have one negative thing to say I would just recommend to actually dine in instead of getting take out. Part of the charm of Opa is the actual decor and music. Without the whole package you will find yourself with pricey take out. To finish I would say great place for coffee or dinner and I am already counting the days until I can go back."}
{"text":"Food was great the atmosphere was good and the live band was awesome but the owner was passing out calendar if dates for the band and he pass (like Trump)me and my sister up like we did not belong there . I was upset but my sister said don't let bother u everything else was good  .... we will be back yes."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give them a try again because I'm trying to eat healthier and low carb. I ordered a chicken  salad and cup of soup. I asked the girl if she could add peppers and onions on the salad as it only comes with walnuts and blue cheese. She stated that it doesn't come with that and it comes with blue cheese and walnuts. I was like hmm OK can I add it? And she told me again they usually don't do that. I was like look I can pay for it and she was like OK don't worry about it but we don't usually do this.  Like I'm asking for a free steak or something.. So I thought that was slightly rude..my cup of soup is about enough to feed my toddler for 4$ that's pretty sad..  My salad is pretty good. I wouldn't pay 11 dollars again for it with such limited ingredients. The chicken is almost always dry everytime I've ever visited.. I was given 2 dressings with my salad both supposed to be balsamic vinegrete I'm assuming. However one is dark like molasses and one was more light brown. Ughh I'm too hungry and in a rush to go back. Here's to hoping I don't get sick. I'm also a mall employee and I remember the last time I came I asked the manager or owner, possibly, if they do mall discount and he treated me like I was a crazy woman and basically told me that it's ridiculous to even ask him such a thing seeing as his prices are way cheaper then they should be compared to his west gate location.. And that I should be happy with what I got.. Side note: this place is the most overpriced and underwhelming food spot in the entire food court.. Save your money and get a salad from chipotle!! I know I will next time.."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place for their breakfast on weekends. They have awesome Greek food, probably the best in town! Try their Greek fries!"}
{"text":"Greek salad is good!  Loved the Gyro and the Greek Fries too.  Ordering was easy and the service was quick!  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Excellent Greek food at a very responsible price. I love the patio, you can relax have a great meal and enjoy the bands playing in the common on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Wonderful! I got the Greek salad with gyro. It was a little pricey ($15 for a salad...) but it could feed 2. Super fresh ingredients, very well flavored. The staff is very friendly.  Atmosphere - good for lunch. Casual, clean, would definitely be ideal for a business lunch."}
{"text":"This place was really good. i enjoy greek food and now i know when i come to AZ i have a good greek restaurant. It took a while to get my food but it was worth the wait. If you are in a hurry this is not the place to go you need time for your order to cook and time to enjoy this delicious dishes"}
{"text":"We just now walked out because they would NOT honor a 15% discount given to us from our timeshare concierge, because it was a copy, not the original.   Their idea of compromise was only 5%!  On principle alone, we left, so $50-60 in business from 4 of us walked out too!"}
{"text":"Greek food is one of my favorites. I love the freshness, the flavors, oh and that yummy soft pita bread! All that being said, I was a little disappointed in this find.  So viewing all the photos, I thought how I wanted to give this new Greek place a try. What really pulled me in was the baklava cheesecake. I've had it once before and it blew me away.   So I ordered take out. Getting a hold of them at first was a bit annoying since the answering machine kept popping up instead of someone who could help me. So then finally somebody answered and proceeded to take my order. The food was ready in 20 minutes which was a relief for all the food I ordered. So the order consisted of the following: Greek salad with chicken, chicken skewers, lamb skewers, the chicken pita, the classic burger with cheese and bacon, the tricolored pasta, and of course the baklava cheesecake.   My Greek salad with chicken was...how would you say...boring. I think salads already sound pretty boring, but if they're made right, they can be insanely delicious! My salad was missing something. Maybe it was the bland Greek dressing to blame, maybe it was the dry grilled chicken, or maybe it was the veggies themselves? Nothing quite tasted what I was expecting. Even the pita bread was a bit dry with tough edges. I tried a little of everyone else's dish and nothing was overwhelmingly delish. So I saved the best for last...the baklava cheesecake. It was ok. It looks really pretty and interesting. But it was just ok.   Overall I'm glad I tried this place out because I can only compare it to the Greek food I have enjoyed in the past and will continue to go there instead."}
{"text":"I have to admit my addiction. I am currently addicted to gyros. I'm not willing to go to therapy or treatment and don't dare try to intervention me. Do NOT!  Opa is my current dealer. The regular gyro or the philly gyro...both do the job. The hummus is pretty great too with different options. I only really mark down because I've paid twice for the Greek fries and got regular fries once and a salad another time. The salad may have just been a hint though."}
{"text":"The restaurants nice but the food was oily and tastes like it wasn't homemade. I want to go again just to make sure it wasn't an anaomally.   We had the falafals and the hummus and the hummus want very good and the falafals were a bit hard oily and dense   Based on the reviews I'm guessing this was an off day but I plan to go back soon and will update the review"}
{"text":"This is a great bar to visit in a local neighborhood. It has awesome televisions. The bar is large and the staff is very friendly. The food is fantastic.  If you like Greek food give them a try.  The cost of the food and drinks is very reaonable.  They have a great happy hour too.   Give Opa Life a try.   You'll like it"}
{"text":"This place has some wonderful dishes and salads.  Our first time there was in the evening and everything was perfect.  Great desserts.  However, we have made several attempts to go for lunch, but, everyone we have walked in, we've done a 180° turnabout because it was too warm inside to enjoy a meal.  They had their east garage door wide open which was letting out all of the cooled air from their A/C & letting in warm air in the upper 90's to the low 100's.  What a waste of electricity which gets passed on to their food prices since their operational expenses are a part of their overhead.  They do have outside misting systems which work marginally on hot days & not at all during humid days.  Plus, recent studies on the use of misting systems near food have shown that the mist picks up airborne bacteria which lands on the food may result in illness.  I guess we will have to wait to return for lunch when the weather cools down in the late Fall.  But in the interim, we will only go on cool evenings so we can enjoy the indoor seating to avoid the food-contaminating misting system.  BTW, in some states, misting systems near food service is outlawed due to the number of people who have become ill from their contaminated food by the misting system.."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a business meeting at this place with its open wall design and multiple big screen TV's.  While you do have to order yourself at the counter, a very nice young lady brought our food out to us and even brought us our utensils, napkins, etc. which are available on a self serve basis. I choose an Opaburger which I thought was one or maybe the best burger I have had.  First, it was huge (maybe a little obscene big) a 1/2 lb. burger and then gyro meat on top plus cucumbers and the special yogurt sauce.  The seating was both booth type and chairs but with our Arizona weather in October and the open walls, what a nice setting to either watch a game or people watch. parking was close so not a long jaunt to the cafe. Servers and register people were all very nice, professional and food was delivered in a timely manner. great evening, food and setting."}
{"text":"Best hummus of my life!!! Have you ever had food so good that it prompted you to create a Yelp account and comment on it? Oppa Greek life did that for me! I just had their hummus Trio of traditional, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomato. I also had their California Specialty Pita. All the food was fresh, delicious, and clearly well-made! I Love it here!"}
{"text":"Excellent find for lunch today. The gyro plate with salad was a huge portion of food. Perfectly seasoned salad and lovely fresh pita bread made it wonderful. The Greek fries my hubby added to his plate were decadent and we cleaned them up."}
{"text":"Not impressed with their food . Not authentic at  all. Who the heck puts lettuce in a gyro . I ordered a Mac and cheese for my child and it looked liked puke . How can u get Mac and cheese wrong for gods sake .  The bath room was disgusting please people check the bathrooms once and in awhile and clean them . The dressing for the Greek salad was over powering . Sooo many wrongs with this place and I will never go back ."}
{"text":"My husband and I always enjoyed this place due to the food, music and atmosphere. But every time we have awful service. We waited an hour for our to-go food. After about 15 minutes we inquired on the status of it. They made it very clear that they forget and said it was almost done. 40 minutes later we got our food.   Now I have worked food service and completely understand accidents happen. But when you forget an order, that order takes priority. We legitimately saw multiple people come in after us, get their food and leave during the time we were waiting. The same delivery driver even came in twice.   After we told them we want our money back they gave us a dessert and a 20% off your next meal voucher. When we got home with our food the order was wrong and my husband and I both felt sick after. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went early to a Jets vs Coyotes game and decided to grab a bite beforehand.  Went in to this little restaurant and their setup is pretty cool on a game day.  They have set menus for game days to keep things moving but it made ordering super easy.  So you go up, order your food and drink, if it's not pop they bring the drinks to you and then the food when it's ready.  I tried their gyro because I hadn't had one in years and it was super tasty.  The meat was tender, the veggies fresh, and their greek fries were incredibly good with loads of feta and cheesy sauce.  I tried a bite of D's lamb souvlaki which was a perfect medium rare and well seasoned - might have to get that one myself next time!  Also had their mediterranean mule with fig vodka which was surprisingly not as sweet as it sounded and really refreshing with the gyro.  Definitely would love to try their regular menu but even a quick meal was delicious here!"}
{"text":"When we got there I already pre-ordered my food. They took forever to check me out. Than I ordered a Greek salad and I got some salad with strawberries and nuts. It wasn't that bad but i didn't ask for that salad."}
{"text":"Definitely have to try it...great food at great prices! I never rate a restaurant based on service since it's so subjective. That being said, I had a pita gyro, the wife had a chicken sandwich, kids had pizza and chicken tenders. No complaints...food was on point with very little wait time. I recommend getting the Greek fries with your order. Best deal was ...kids eat free. Be sure to ask the cashier."}
{"text":"We had such a great time at lunch. The food was so delicious and the serve was absolutely amazing. Our server Jey was so upbeat and entertaining. He can instantly put you in a good mood! The location is great too. We sat outside near the fire pit and it is so relaxing. I would definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Sigh, Westgate continues to disappoint and no one cares at any of the restaurants that works at any of them.  Came here for a quick bite after a coyote game, bought a beer and chicken pita.   1. Hair in my pita, no one cared 2. Asked for taziki... No one cared 3. Ordered a beer, it didn't come with my order... I asked for my beer from the cashier \"are you sure they didn't bring it?\" Some dude was too busy talking on his cell phone to fill the glass all the way, I got 3/4's of a beer Just don't eat anywhere at Westgate... No one cares about what they serve you"}
{"text":"My dad and I decided on Opa Life for lunch & I'm glad we did! As fans of salads, we ordered the Greek salad and Caprese salad to share. The Greek salad was brilliant. Large serving of lettuce with a good amount of tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, and feta cheese. Now....the Caprese salad was on another level of brilliant. The balsamic drizzle was spectacular. I would even recommend ordering it as an appetizer. The staff was talkative and friendly. Can't wait to come again for lunch or for one of their many evening musical appearances."}
{"text":"The portions were very large but the food was so so. It was a very crowded crazy with pre game folks trying to get lunch before the football game. Perhaps on a less busy day, the food might be better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is amazing and the servers/owner are great! Greek salad is awesome and so are the steak and chicken kabobs!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food.  If you like Greek food this is a great option in Westgate.  The Greek fries are particularly tasty and the Saganaki is as good as you'll  find anywhere in the west valley."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! This fresh, new, little, somewhat hidden Greek place took over where My Big Fat Greek Express used to be. They've done a nice remodel, opened and brightened the place up and, although I was the only one in the joint when I visited, it looks like it should be a friendly and inviting atmosphere.   The menu includes the usuals; appetizers ($5-15), salads ($9-15), wraps ($9-10) and pitas (~$8), and \"Off The Grill\" plates that include your choice of 2 sides ($10-16), all with your choice of chicken, pork, beef, lamb, shimp, and sandwiches/burgers ($10-12), etc. They have a full coffee bar with what look like reasonable prices, fruit smoothies, and Italian sodas, and a selection of breakfast paninis. There are about 6 beers on tap for $4.50 and 7 or so wines by the glass at $7, and a scrumptious looking list of desserts ranging from $4-$8.   My Chicken Souvlaki plate included 2 generous skewers of chicken that was flavorful, tender and juicy, fries, and rice that was tasty and well cooked, a pita bread and some sauces. Service was friendly from the one woman in the store, who was also clearing up to close, but still attentive, offered me water while I waited for my takeaway food, and took the time to tell me about their lunch special ($6 wraps & pitas from 11-3).   They also offer Happy Hour from 3-7pm with deals on apps, beer and wine.   My 3-star rating is for the food (quality, quantity, speed to produce) and service. The only reason they're not getting 5 stars from me is because I think their prices are a bit too high for the market. I think this may affect them, given their newness, lack of reputation, and somewhat obscure location. Munchies (my go-to place) is serving roughly the same fare for about 30% less, overall, and they're open till the wee hours.    So, I'll check out Opa Life again, and based on my first visit, recommend it, but probably not for a quick weeknight dinner except if you go during lunchtime."}
{"text":"Always great food! Reasonably priced besides the pricey salads. No sweet potato fries (a staple at the other Greek place we visit) and one of the employees hovered too much while our party was still dining."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get your Greek on. The gyros were to die for and the Greek fries were amazing. I will for sure be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I grabbed a Groupon for this place and were excited to try it. We think the aquarium center is gorgeous and we looking forward to dinner.   We walked in and we're disappointed it was counter service but we are adaptable.   We ordered.  Chicken Nuggets for my son.  Gyro pizza for husband.  Falafel Pita for myself.   The chicken nuggets were lukewarm at best, the applesauce required a spoon but they only had soup spoons. The kids cup was a dollar but was only for soft drinks.   The Gyro pizza was larger than expected but lacked meat.   The Pita was dry. There was no Taziki or hummus as advertised. I was so disappointed.   And this place was expensive. The Groupon was good got 20 dollars, and I spent an additional 28 dollars. Too expensive for fair to poor quality food."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and trying out as many places as I can, stopped in here for a late lunch and iced tea.  Free wifi was awesome since I was without for a bit when I moved.  The \"Greek\" fries are messy and yummy and I'd love to eat them again.  I had chicken that sadly was too dry and not so fun.  I will try something else next time."}
{"text":"This review is not just about the food, service, and decor, but the package deal with free music most nights.  I've been here several times and am very impressed with the fresh, updated look from the previous Greek restaurant.  The food is very good, the servers very friendly and efficient.  When I have gone on a night when a band was playing, they seemed to have enough staff to handle taking and delivering orders very well, and the kitchen wasn't overwhelmed.  Also, their pita stays nice and soft, unlike that well-known pita place whose pita dries out hard within 30 minutes.  They have some super bands: jazz, blues, and a mix of others.  It is amazing considering some of them command decent admission costs at other venues and sell out to hundreds.  So the way I look at it, if any of the food seems a little pricey, (and I don't, since you get a lot for your money), then consider it partially for the price of the entertainment, if they are playing while you are there."}
{"text":"The food was good the portions where great, lots of good food is always great!!!!  There are a couple things that make me say I'll never go back  A) no table service, if I want to stand in line I'll go to fast food. Hire a waiter or two!!!  B) noise the noise level was horrible. There is some guy standing in the corner playing some high pitched guitar like instrument through an amp so loud it hurt my ears. Our party sat outside as far away as possible and by the time we where done I was horse from shouting to my friend sitting next to me  C) it was pricey TOO PRICEY considering the noise and lack of service"}
{"text":"Wow we'll be back!! Good and service was excellent! I had a lamb kabob plate with rice and veggies. Lamb was delicious ! My husbands gyro was gone in 5 mins !"}
{"text":"Great place! Open air cafe but not too hot. Food was great, and the balaclava was delicious.  Greek fries cannot be missed l, especially with a gyro. Polite, friendly staff- overall wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I gave them 4 stars because their service was excellent!But the food was honestly a disappointment to me. First off, Greek food was suppose to be unique and different but honestly it tastes like any other restaurants to me.  I got their Greek burger and the patty itself tasted so bland. The buns were soggy and the burger itself was really hard to eat... I'm not going to lie... Their lamb though was very delicious and tender. Love the lamb! Took a few bites from my friend balsamic vinaigrette wrap and the chicken was dry, the wrap didn't really have a \"Greek\" taste to it... Just tasted like a wrap where you can get at Safeway or something. Greek fries was alright. It was too saucy....To sum it up, the food was alright. I would definitely come back once a while... This wouldn't be my favorite down to earth place. Will definitely try a different dish next time."}
{"text":"Opa Life Greek Cafe has a fun European atmosphere. Kotosoupa has a delicious lemon taste. Would recommend to try this cafe out!"}
{"text":"Great place for food and family.  This restaurant is located in the heart of West gate plaza where you get to shop and let your kids play in the kiddie fountain. ...the Greek food here is real good.  I was pleased with the over all service as well..there's even an outdoor patio with mist sprayers to keep u cool in the summer time. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant with delicious healthy options! Where to begin, my first visit to opah I had the watermelon/tomato salad. Not only was it tasty but also filling since it came with a side of gyro meat. My second visit I took my husband. We split the berry salad and Greek burger. The salad is 1 of the best we've ever had and the burger was perfectly cooked. We've been back a third time and it was equally as good."}
{"text":"I've had OPA life in arrowhead and I've loved it! I came to the one in Westgate and it was super confusing. The girl who helped us was super rude! I asked her for the menu and she pointed near the door and told me to go get one... And she was just being super mean. She needs to get a new job because clearly she hates this one. The food was good but I hated my experience because of the bad customer service."}
{"text":"We came here after a game and it wasn't busy. Staff was friendly but it took 35 minuets to get a salty chicken salad.  The table next to us got all their orders mixed up and half ate while the others waited.  Management apologized but they should have been more prepared for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, and amazing food. What isn't to love? Jey took excellent care of us, checking in and making sure we were having a good time. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I literally don't eat Greek Food anywhere but here! They truly make you feel at home, have a great selection of food and beverages. There are no better Greek Fries anywhere! The pizzas are also amazing. This is an excellent place to come eat great food, enjoy amazing food and great music!! The owner is an awesome gentleman who is hands on and very friendly to all his guest! Definitely a place my family frequents because we receive awesome food, great customer service and awesome vibes"}
{"text":"My 28 year old son took my Mom and I here for a little lunch on Mothers Day. Grandma's order was completely wrong. She asked the waitress where the salad & rice were & said they gave her French fries instead.  The poorly trained waitress: responded: \"oh...are you ok with that\"? She got French fries, no rice or salad. Waitress didn't respond: \"let us get that corrected for you right away. Waitress never came back except to bring My order after I had to go to the counter and ask if they forgot my meal.  Nevertheless, my meal came out 10 minutes later. Will NOT be back. Terrible staff training. French fries terrible. Good ice tea and grilled chicken Slovaki was pretty good. What a disappointment for my son wanting to impress his mom & grandma on Mother's Day."}
{"text":"They were supposed to be open at 9 am but only delivery person was there.  A manager finally showed up to say they don't open until 10 am.  So why do they have breakfast items on there menu if they don't open until 10??   And the manager wasn't very polite when I showed him on yelp the time and on Google shows them open already"}
{"text":"I have visited this place 3 times, and I must say the food is absolutely delicious! I have had mostly their off the grill items of the menu and although they are a little pricey, the quality was great! The only complaint was that my veggies were over cooked once, but I'm very picky with my veggies. My only suggestions would be for them to add a grilled veggie kabob as an entree or side. Yum! They also have really good coffee. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cashier was very nice. That's pretty much all this place has going for them. Food is over priced and cooks can't tell you what ingredients are in their food or where you can find that info."}
{"text":"First time here. It was just okay. Nothing earth shattering. Prices were ok, good was ok as well. I think what would make this place rock is if they lowered the prices or increased the portions. Increasing the value would make this place much better. Other than that, this location is at Westgate so is pretty nice sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Waited too long for a weak gyro, light on the meat. On the expensive side as well. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This place is incredible....can't say enough about their gyros, Greek fries, and the staff. It's just an awesome place to go!"}
{"text":"We went after going to the aquarium in the same complex. If you go on the weekends be prepared to wait because it seems to get busy in their. The people who work their are very nice and helpful. We had 7 people in our group so 3 of us ordered Gyros, one the Salmon burger, Falafel Platter, kids burger and kids pizza. The food was good and the portions were good. The only complaint was the tzatziki was not authentic. It tasted like it was store bought. You couldn't taste the cucumber in it. Also on the falafel they did not put a lot of hummus on it so a little dry and the pita could have been done a little more a little chewy. Also the night we went ice machine kept getting clogged so you couldn't get ice for your drinks. Some people didn't care some were getting aggravated."}
{"text":"Im so glad i didn't pay full price!! I went on a groupon that i saw. Was meaning to try this place for a while and what better way to try something new than with a discounted offer....well this place seems to be overhyped, overpriced and overdisappointing. The food in reality is pricey. $9 for a gyro and fries. This is what i went for because its greek food, they cant go wrong with Gyros right? WRONG. There was a ton of lettuce with very little meat. You really couldnt fold it, you wish it was because it had so much meat but instead way too much lettuce. The meat had ABSOLUTELY no flavor. It was bland, completely tasteless. Service was mediocre, all they do is take your order in the counter and bring it to you. The owners (some tall guy and bald guy) never acknowledged anyone, they were more interesting in checking out their waitresses (dudes didnt hide it) and flirting with women patrons. Kind of ackward to see the tall guy in his attempts.   You could tell they spent alot in remaking the place but food dissapoints. Will never be back to this place."}
{"text":"While strolling around Westgate we struggled to decide where to eat and happened upon Opa. What a pleasant surprise that it turned out to be great. They have HUGE beers on draft (I recommend the Hoppy B$**h it was great) and all of the food was great. We ordered the Gyro pita, beef schwarma, and a pepperoni pizza and all were delicious. I would highly recommend stopping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a new Greek place since our favorite closed. Was so happy to find this place. I'm usually not a fan of walk up ordering at restaurants - but the feel to this place is unique. The food is delicious. The hummus is great& the Greek fries are so good!  Haven't had something I didn't like. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very uneven experience: their \"fast casual\" style failed me because I ordered lamb souvlaki. It took nearly half an hour to arrive at our table.   Perhaps that's because we had to move from the first table we chose. It sat right under their extremely noisy air conditioner. The service staff largely ignored our concerns about our food delays until we got the owner's attention. Even then they delivered some delicious Greek-style fries that we hadn't ordered, and needed to be reminded twice to bring us the baklavas which we had.   The quality of the lamb was superb, and so was the seasoning. The baklava was loaded with Saigon cinnamon, which I loved but my wife did not. The salad was blandly ordinary, as was most everything else, including my wife's rice and chicken souvlaki. And what kind of a \"Greek\" restaurant doesn't have moussaka or pastitsio on their menu? Their prices are at least 10% higher than they should be. Smaller portion sizes might let them drop them to a more suitable level.   I guess we won't be going back any time soon..."}
{"text":"Had great food and great entertainment Sunday night July 30 Th . Mixed Orbit was an amazing band with a mixed genre of music . They played for almost an hour and 1/2 . The calamari salad was  AMAZING !! Fun place , great prices and portions !"}
{"text":"Just discovered thus place today. Nestled in  a Food and Entertainment Court Yard at the Butterfly and Sea Aquarium in Scottsdale.  Very clean and modern. The Lamb Kabobs, rice,salad and Hummus were very tasty.  Great place I even open for Breakfast.  I am happy I found this Greek  Cafe"}
{"text":"Tonight's experience at Opa LifeGreek Cafe at Westgate was a 5 stars! With the team of Daemon, Jey and Danny tonight they made my experience wonderful! Customer service is extremely important to me. Being new to the state and the restaurant they were able to answer all my questions. They greeted we with a smile that is how a restaurant should be runned from when you first walk in the front door to when you leave.  I am very impressed with this team tonight! The restaurant is well-kept, clean and has an inside outside seating area. The food is well-made great quality and prices are reasonable. If you come here you will get great customer service and be happy."}
{"text":"I miss the greek express this place is nice but no worth the 4.00 more charge. Very nice remodel, but gone is the friendly service this place has an identity problem it wants to be a restaurant, but with all the TV's is trying to be a sports bar which it is not and will never will be. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the Pita Gyro with Greek salad. So fresh and so awesome. Glad we stopped in here."}
{"text":"Great server Jey is awesome and personable. Made us feel comfortable and enjoyed the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"We stopped here after the Seahawks game to get a bite to eat and wait out the traffic. Honestly, we arrived here by accident. We just kept walking until we found a place with a line that wasn't ridiculously long.  We are SO GLAD WE DID!!   The service was friendly and engaging and the food was EXCELLENT!! The cilantro hummus with cucumbers subbed for pita bread was fresh and flavorful. And the desserts.... OH MY!!! I ate the entire thing, even when I was full because I could not bare to leave a bite on the table.  I'd love to try more courses!  PLEASE OPEN ONE IN GILBERT!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. The line wasn't long. The place was clean. My food came out in a timely manner and the staff was friendly. I thought the prices was a little expensive but when the food came the portion was huge. Definitely the best salad you can get on the west side in Glendale!! Would returns and recommend others try."}
{"text":"Great food and the patio area is really nice and relaxing! The Greek fries are very good and they have fast service."}
{"text":"I really want this to be a great place.  I may try it again in the future."}
{"text":"We were greeted by the hostess out infront if the Restaurant. The atmosphere is fun and inviting, Especially for the little ones! They even have hanging taradactle's that are so life like and have cartoons in for the kids that will fully keep them entertained. Our waitress was Jennifer she was very fun, energetic and very knowalable of the menu. If i could give 10 stars I would for her!  We ordered the chicken wings( buffalo- mild style )they were fantastic!  They arrived hot , fast and were perfectly cooked.. I ordered the Gyro with Greek frys it was so good but now I can't move because i couldn't stop eating it. Faimly ordered Cheese burger, shrimp dish, and they all loved there meals also. For the desert, Jennifer bought me desert for my birthday Baklava and faimly got the Baklava cheesecake. The owner Chris really knows how to run a good business. We are members at the aqarium so if your looking to take a date out or a faimly night out DEFITINLY stop by and eat here. Thanks everyone well be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here before going to a hockey game. After we ordered our food, we were looking for a place to sit since they were a bit busy. While we were looking for a table one of the waitresses was following us around with our appetizer. We had been looking for a table for all of 30 seconds.The staff was friendly and super fast and the food was friggin delicious (especially the baklava cheesecake). It also serves local beer, including different types of Four Peaks beer."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with a couple friends yesterday. today. Great atmosphere and drear food. I had the gyro in a tomato basil wrap with Greek fries, which I think I prefer over the pita. Didn't feel so heavy. The Greek fries were amazing! My friend had the veggie souvlaki with Greek fries and salad and then we got tiramisu and a chocolate triangle they was filled with chocolate mousse. So, so good! Next time I'm there I'm trying the baklava cheesecake."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago I could stop into any Greek restaurant, be it fancy or a dive, and expect to sink my chops into a fabulous gyro sandwich. Usually, the gyros meat would be sliced from a spit, so it was nice and hot and had just a touch of crispness to it. Most good gyros joints would serve the Kronos brand. Unfortunately, Opa failed on both counts. There are many terrific gyros stops in the Phoenix area. Sadly, this place isn't one of them"}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  The staff is always friendly and very attentive. Even when the store is busy, the food does not take a while to get to you. If you are hungry, try the Aegean Club. It is huge and will for sure fill you up. The burger is also surprisingly good here.  The food always come out fast and at the right temperature."}
{"text":"Decent food but would not return. Got home to realize half my order was missing. The food is terribly overpriced as well. $25 for two plates, $32 total, to come home and half is missing. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Wonderful spot at the Westgate center. A must try. Make sure you share your portions and order dessert as everything is delicious. We will be returning"}
{"text":"Great menu! Very nice people fast service. The food is really good. The place is clean the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the onset and the food,  always worth wild to go to from work to order lunch.  Thanks for being Awesome!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Went in on a Friday afternoon for lunch, very affordable, fresh food! Definitely would recommend and will be back again."}
{"text":"Those Greek fries though...sooooo good! Only ordered to-go so can't comment on the service. Lamb souvlaki was pretty good but not as good as when it was My Big Fat Greek express    But seriously...get them Greek fries haha"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Get the chicken souvlaki pita if you want a bunch of lettuce one sliver of onion and three pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"Back again today for Greek fries and traditional gyro.  Service was spot on.  Fries were the best I've ever had.  Gyro was good, but a bit on the bland side.  Could have used some feta and more seasoning on the meat.  All in all very good."}
{"text":"Good food. The gyro could've been better, but the chicken souvlaki was great. And definitely try the Greek fries, very interesting experience. Oh, and the Greek coffee was good too."}
{"text":"I've been on a Mediterranean cuisine kick lately, eating it about 2-3 times a week so the competition they faced my first time in today was very broad. The menu is excellent, has a huge variety where a lot of Med. restaurants lack. Most notably, they offer an Aegean Club Sandwich which I was tempted to try (check it out!). I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki wrap which I will first say, was UNBELEIVABLE however I was surprised to see the chicken was actually HUGE pieces of Kebab chicken (not complaining) which I expected however to be sliced or chopped chicken. The chicken was seasoned well, matched with hummus great, but one more huge compliment.....Their Tzatziki sauce is PERFECT. Not too thick, not too thin, and tastes wicked fresh. I will definitely go back as the servers there are also as hot as the food and finding out that on Tuesday's they have $1 Gyro tacos !"}
{"text":"I knew that I had be in the area so planned my route to go for lunch. Best idea that I've had all week.  I keep thinking that I should try something deeper on the menu than the gyro combo but gave into my cravings and went with it again. I know the fries are the best but decided to go with the rice for the side. Great idea! Perfect addition to any meal. The gyro was just as I expected......huge and wonderfully overstuffed.  The staff are super friendly and welcoming.  I'm giving up on looking for another place for Greek and just coming here when the cravings hit."}
{"text":"One of my favorite type of restaurants is Greek.  And one of favorite Greek restaurants is Opa Life Greek Cafe.  My lamb souvaki tonight was grilled to perfection on top of sauteed vegtables and salad.  Definitely one of the healthier dining options at Westgate.  The owner of the restaurant, Allan, seems to always be around ensuring quality of the meals and the overall dining experience."}
{"text":"Delicious Mediterranean food, great happy hour specials, and kid-friendly. We took two little kids for dinner a week before Christmas. They had pasta (big portions) with apple sauce. We enjoyed a scrumptious calamari-topped green salad and classic gyro pita. Great beer on tap. Owner's kids were sitting adjacent enjoying an envy-inducing ice cream treat. Big TVs had college bowl games; regulars at the bar; great local atmosphere. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"had the grape leaves, calimari and the california pita, was mediocre. went on a friday evening so they had a really loud band inside. blonde girl with tats working the register was moody, maybe an off day. overall average joint that'll hit the spot if you're hungry."}
{"text":"This place is great! Extremely friendly from the second we walked in. Brandon was very attentive. Awesome portion and quality on both kids meals and my entre. I would totally recommend giving this place a try.  We will be back."}
{"text":"What a great place! We were visiting and stopped in for dinner.  Try the Chicken Souvlaki (had mine with rice and veggies), Greek Salad and the Greek Fries topped with Feta, Parmesan and delicious lemon dijon dressing. So good! Fun atmosphere and lots of seating inside and covered outside.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. Horrible service, food is meh. Just last weekend after getting done with a movie, we went up to the food court and I was going to get some chicken soup but apparently this location is special in that they close down a half hour before the mall does. I worked at the mall for years and know vendors can get fined for doing so. I'm going to enjoy calling the management company to let them know."}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing, clean, good service, and amazing food. I was going to take a picture but I tasted it and couldn't stop.  I got gyro pita and Greek salad.  Bomb.com I will be back"}
{"text":"This place was a surprise to me, honestly. A coworker brought me here for lunch, and this is not at all my style of food. I ordered a gyro burger and hoped for the best. HOLY MOLY was I surprised! Absolutely amazing! I will definitely be back here when I am in the valley. My recommendation, get the gyro burger!"}
{"text":"My new favorite happy hour spot. Restaurant is open and airy with indoor/outside seating. Great happy hour prices and food and drinks. The Grecian Delight Pizza is phenomenal. We also love the Aegean Club (huge!) w/ the Greek fries. The Shrimp Souvlaki is grilled and has a nice marinade. Great customer service and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of the best Meditrainian spots in town . Can't go wrong here. Good staff as well. Very clean."}
{"text":"Stopped to eat and feed my cravings for Humus!!! Ordered the trio: original, garlic and SW chipotle. All we excellent except the SW chipotle, for me personally it left a woodsy weird after taste that I couldn't get past. Had the club gyro and that was beyond excellent!!!! Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The lunch special this week is phenomenal. Perfect blend of Latin and greek. The tea is also real good. Service, specially if you are a returning customer  exceeds expectations. Make sure Luis is in the kitchen and the portions are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Turned me into a Greek food fan now, nevermind that I've always loved baklava. The desserts look insane (big portions), but I ordered a Philly gyro with Greek salad and I devoured it so fast. Soft and delicate pita, and indeed dripping with oil. Yum. Yes, cashier looks miserable and messed up our order number so we got teased with someone's cheesecake order, but no harm done. Lovely service from the buser as we chatted about our visit to Arizona."}
{"text":"Was in town again for the SEA vs AZ game and had to stop by here again. Still amazing food and even better service just like last year. The owner is so down to earth and friendly, you'll even see him cleaning tables when it's busy and I really respect that .Tried their baklava cheesecake this time and it was heaven !"}
{"text":"So, a little bit of a rough start with the line. It is almost a fast food style start with a line to the cash register and then order and take a number.  After that it then feels like a normal restaurant as the food is actually really good.  I had a Mediterranean style Greek salad with chicken and a side of gyro meat. All was very fresh and very flavorful and the pita slices were very good. I judge Greek on pita and theirs was top notch.  My wife ordered the salmon and asked a great question. Salmon salad or salmon sandwich.  Well, the salad is like 4 dollars more than the sandwich yet it isn't he same size. Get the same and order a side salad yah cheapos. Lol. She did and it totally paid off. Also, Pepsi machine with a flavor blast...... Awesome!"}
{"text":"I eat out a lot!!!! If I have to sell you on coming to this place; then that's what I shall do. You obviously are still reading this because you want to know if the food is good. Well- this place is CLEAN, and the food is good... Don't take my word, stop searching YELP and go give it a try; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was delicious bit pricey but think it's norm for area. Enjoyed the live Greek music too..."}
{"text":"I came from Hawaii to visit a friend in Arizona. I asked her to please look for a Greek restaurant so I can have some good authentic Greek food since we really don't have much here in Hawaii. She recommended this place Opa life Greek Cafe due to the Yelp ratings and pictures posted. I agreed it looked great and was so excited to finally have some delicious Greek food.  We drove pretty far to get there and when we walked in the door we really didn't get greeted I walked up to the counter and ask if there was a table for 5. And the girl now I know her name Tonya totus there was entertainment and there are no seats available. So I asked her does she know how long it'll be usually most places will tell you a certain amount of time to wait. So basically she was giving us the cold shoulder and made us feel like we should leave so I said okay let's go. Then she said well there are seats in the back. Which kind of upset me due to the fact she said there was nothing available. So she pointed and we walk back there to see what was there. There were two tables. We sat down not knowing how to order being that it was our first time. She walked up to us to get us water and told us you order up at the front by the bar and I'll bring it to your table and gave us menus. So we did that. I was very specific about no onions on the pizza and no papers on the Greek salad. There are no Greeks that eat Capers on a salad. She followed through and repeated the order and then we began to make our drinks. The dr. Pepper was watered down and my friend got water the first cup she was given had a crack in it and water was leaking out so we let Tanya know and she gave us another truck which was worse and water was pouring out the sides. We once again that our waitress time you know and she said she'll get another cup but for us not to pour the ice out because they're short on ice. We sat down waited for her order and when it came about 15-20 minutes later. The tomatoes were yellow green looking very little red Capers all over the salad and the Greek Pizza at onions everywhere. It is a waitresses job to make sure the order is correct before they bring it out. I also mention to her that the water tasted funny so we were going to get different drinks and she came back with a smart-ass remark there's nothing I can do about the water. Any Greek restaurant has very nice people if there Greek and take pride in what they do. The girl beside her also had a nasty attitude she looked great wearing a blue tank top. At this point I was so disgusted and she didn't seem like she wanted to redo the order so I just told her I want a refund. I paid $50.08 and she refunded me $49.83 I told her that's not the amount and she told me she would be short $0.25 in her drawer I couldn't believe what I heard. I think this place needs to shut down or hire new people with better attitudes starting from the very beginning I should have known when she copped an attitude about the seats. I'm so disappointed that this restaurant has the name Greek on it. I will never return and I hope this opens the eyes to others not to go. I can't say if the food is good or not I didn't get to taste it. But the service was absolutely horrific"}
{"text":"Beautiful new Greek restraunt at westgate! Its a great atmosphere wonderful happy service and the food made me fall in love with greek food all over again!!!! Definately coming back soon"}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing! Their Baklava Iced Coffee is delicious. The staff were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter before a concert. First time eating at Opa. We had the Greek fries and meat lovers pizza. The entire staff was great, and Jey made sure we had a great experience. Greek fries were awesome, the pizza was delicious except for the chicken which was a little dry. But there were so many other yummy meats on the pizza that it wasn't a big deal.   We'll definitely be back when we're at Westgate."}
{"text":"The lady working the register was on her phone while customers were waiting then when I asked a question she seemed annoyed which was a simple question then she got back on her phone while she was talking to me the guys working in the kitchen seemed nice but annoyed by the lady who was not helping at all so fire the chola and get someone who acutally wants to work . The food has little taste ."}
{"text":"The best Greek food I have had in all of Phoenix and the best option to eat at Westgate. The decor, finishes, and ambience is modern and nice. Service was very attentive. Fast casual where you order at the counter, sit down, and they bring the food to you.  Food was on point. We had lamb souvlaki, Greek pita, and baklava. Presentation was beautiful. Food tasted amazing, very fresh ingredients, healthy, and not oily. We ate it all before we could take a picture."}
{"text":"Greek fries were delicious! However, 5, 1/2 slices of meat in a gyro is unacceptable. Maybe a child size portion but certainly not an adult size. So disappointed. We should have complained but didn't. I regret that. Good luck, we won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Aegean Club is ridiculously good and makes this place stand out from other Greek places already. Happy hour is fantastic as well. Great prices on beer you actually want to drink! Definitely will be revisiting"}
{"text":"There's not much I can say about Opa Life Greek Cafe that I haven't already said. I wrote a Yelp! review about the Westgate location recently and they also earned five stars for the service and excellent food. I also mentioned that I would seek their east side location. And I found it... By accident.  While doing business in Tempe this past week, I heard there was an Opa Life in the area. Then I realized I was on Baseline and it was close by. It was literally in the same parking lot. This was a fortunate coincidence since my girlfriend and I have decided to make a conscious effort to eat better. Plus we both really enjoy Greek food!  If it was possible to give more than five stars, I would. The extra star would be for the character of the architecture and decor. They also feature live music every night (except Tuesdays when we were there).  Not only is Opa Life consistently delicious, it's healthy and the plating is obviously important to the folks in the kitchen. And everything is always fresh and colorful. Kudos to the woman on the register who recommended the Jalapeño Hummus!  When you're craving some amazing Greek/Mediterranean cuisine, whether you're in the west or east valley, it's nice to know one of these two options is close. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I misjudged Opa Life Greek Cafe. The restaurants around Westgate tend to be either really good or simply manage to exist due to foot traffic. On our way to a Coyotes game, my friend suggested Greek for dinner. I knew exactly where he was suggesting. Opa Life has been at Westgate for more than a year and I've walked past it several times. What a mistake!  There was a long line to the door (and it was out the door by the time we ordered) but again, it was game night. Hindsight tells me that those in line were not there by accident. In a word, Opa Life Greek Cafe is outstanding!  Once again, my usual Gyro Plate was selected to compare the cuisine. This is the best gyro meat I've had, period. It's tender and it's seasoned well. For the money, I've never had such a generous portion either. But I didn't have to force myself to eat a single bite because it was so good! My only criticism would be with the amount of bell pepper on my Greek salad, but this is a minor quibble.  Not only are the plates loaded with flavor, but the presentation was really nice for a casual restaurant. Speaking of casual, the atmosphere of Opa Life is perfect. The indoor and outdoor spaces blend together when the doors are opened.  In the future, whether I'm headed to a movie or a hockey game, I'm going to have a tough time walking past Opa Life again. In fact, I'm going to have to seek out their other location in the East Valley. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If I could rate it a zero I would. Totally unprofessional. Waited for over 40 minutes for our food just to find out that our order ticket someone how got lost and the cooks didn't make our food at all. Everyone else though got their food in a timely manner. I guess our money wasn't green enough. Ended up getting a refund and leaving."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Why have a tip jar if you have me grab the menu to order, fill my own drinks, pick up my own food and even pick up the to go boxes myself? Also took about 30-40 minutes just to get the food which wasn't all served at once. The last dish out was the appetizer. Most people \"working\" here are just standing around or taking on their phone outside.   Gave it two stars for the food tasting Bette than average but not much better whilst the service was horrible.   Probably would not return."}
{"text":"I just tried this place this past Sunday with a friend and it was pretty awesome. I got a caprice pita. Very yummy. And with that I got Greek fries. OMG. So good. Probably my favorite way to have French fries now. Very friendly service too. Very pleased and happy I went there. :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time to this restaraunt. We were greeted nicely. We were trying to read the menu as it was an order your food pay and then they bring the food to your table. They seemed like they were rushing for us to order. Cashier seemed more annoyed and seemed like she wanted to hurry and get our order done. We sat outside which was nice. My dish the falafel was over cooked normally when I have had this dish at other restaraunts there is a sauce I asked the bald headed server who looked at me like I was an idiot and pointed its right there. He was referring to the hummus under the lettuce ok that was a first. Again first time ever at this restaraunt. Should have went to Kabukis. Anyways the food was mediocre personally I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful in selecting a meal. The food was great, nice select. It's a long drive for us, but we'll be back."}
{"text":"So Opa Life has taken over the space formally occupied by My Big Fat Greek Express as apparently the parent company of Opa Life bought out MBFGE per my conversation with the woman working the counter who is apparently from corporate helping launch the store.  The first thing I noticed here was that they did a really nice job renovating the old space that was dingy and tired space. This is nice and refreshing.  Sadly the second thing I noticed was the sticker shock of this place compared to MBFGE which was pretty reasonable. I think they are up a couple bucks up across the board.  I got the special which was a combo deal of chicken pita, drink and a side for $9. The food was fine but lacking flavor. The flavors were pretty blank on the pita it was pretty much red onion and taziki for taste the chicken was band and over cooked.  They just opened so I will give them a bit and try again and see if it's any different but with Pita Shack closer to me and I think a bit more flavor it will be hard to convince myself to come this way often."}
{"text":"Wife and I having Coffee and baklava cheesecake. Simply amazing! This place is cozy and has outside dining."}
{"text":"Lovely interior with 3 TVs tuned to different stations. The seating is booth on one side and chairs on the other side of the tables. You order at the counter and the friendly staff delivers your food to your table when it is ready.   I had the chicken pita with a mountain of fries for just $7.95. Unlike many pita places with dried out meat, veggies and old herbs, this was a soft pita with juicy meat, fresh veggies, just the right amount of fresh herbs and a nice tzatziki sauce. The fries were hot and crispy and way more than I could eat.   Parking is close to the door. Super clean and with a desert display that made my mouth water, but my tummy was too full from my pita and fries. Maybe next time. :-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoy this place. Great employees and great food. They've forgotten to give us tzatiki sauce twice, which kinda sucked. But we love the place and the hours are perfect for us."}
{"text":"The gyros were ok, glad they had the meat dolmades, our fave.  A dollar more here for the gyro than the former My Big Fat Greek Restaurant.  But this is the nearest Greek that we like."}
{"text":"Food is good, ambiance is nice, but the fast food approach in ordering isn't cool.  Especially on busy nights.  Its 1st come 1st serve on the seats, so i had my wife save the seat while she texted me her order.  If you want a second drink you have to get back in line (unless you are drinking soda, the have a serve yourself soda machine).  I would go back but probably not if they are busy (aka game nights/ weekends)."}
{"text":"The food looks and tastes amazing....so glad there is finally great food close by. Perfect pre movie dinner choice. The staff is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Thus far, Opa is my FAVORITE Greek restaurant. I have it delivered a few times a month and it NEVER disappoints. I've tried multiple items and they are all DELICIOUS. Keftedes, dolmathes, Greek pizza, gyros and ALL souvlakis are a MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Great place, great portions, I had a gyro with a Greek salad, and the draft Kombucha. Love that they are open early and serve lunch early too as  we aren't big on b fast food and not many places are open for lunch before 11 am. The guy that helped us was awesome and funny. He offered us upsells but it wasnt pushy at all. Will go back."}
{"text":"We had the Greek Salad with Chicken, delicious! Large portion, yummy pita accompanied the salad. The restaurant is clean and well decorated, order first at the counter then find a table!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend. She had the gyro and side Greek salad. She said the gyro was delicious! I got the Greek salad with shrimp, the salad and dressing was amazing and gigantic!! I highly recommend it!! The shrimp on my salad were large, quality shrimp however, there was too much seasoning on them. The herbs were almost crusting the shrimp and it was just too strong of a flavor for me. All and all this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"This was ok. We needed to eat quickly before our activity.  I ordered a chicken pita.   Everything was fresh but the chicken was in big chucks. I had to cut with a plastic knife.  Place was busy and business consistent."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. Was wonderful. Fresh and quality food. Not cookie cutter. A little pricey for lunch, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot when visiting OdySea. I had the Gyro Platter which was very good for a cafe style restaurant. Enjoyed sitting on the patio and the service was good. Looking forward to going back and trying some other options on the menu."}
{"text":"I liked this place when I didn't have to actually go there. Over the last 3 weeks I've spent about 300 bucks here using UberEATS and enjoyed the food.  Then I won some gift cards through a silent auction at a school fundraiser to Opa Life(figured since I like the place and it's to help fund the school activities, it's a win win for me). Well, there was an issue with the gift cards so I contacted the PTSA to resolve the issue.  The PTSA was great and contacted me back and told me they spoke to the manager at Opa Life named Allan and all I needed to do was go in and talk to Allan and he'd take care of me. As soon as I walked in and asked for Allan he replied \"yeah, what do you need\",  oh so I guess you're Allan, no customer service skills. Not letting that first issue get to me I preceded to tell him that I won these gift cards and was told to come in and see him.  This is the moment he gets irritated and turns his back to me and starts making another customers coffee.  Ok, I can deal with that too, it's getting busy.  Then he tells me \"I don't know what you want\", this is the moment I am in shock at his treatment towards me and tell him I want to order food but I want the gift cards to work.  He then tells me he doesn't have time for this because he's busy.  Well Allan, I wanted to order some food and use the gift cards. It's not like I don't already spend a lot of money there. Then I tell him I spend a lot of money there that is my actual money and he still just keeps telling me \"I don't know what you want, I don't have time for this\".  So, I guess I'm moving on to another restaurant and will never go back there as long as Allan works there. This transaction took place about 30 minutes prior to me writing this review and I've already placed another order through UberEATS to another Greek restaurant so hopefully it's good."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a key client. My client was so offended by the Heavy Metal music playing. She mentioned it to the manager,  they laughed and turned it up. They said it's what they like to listen to."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying this was a very busy day, it was the free dinosaur event day at the aquarium and the three little ones I had with me were hungry and they had several boards across the park that read \" KIDS EAT FREE pizza, chicken tenders, hamburgers, mac n cheese, fries\"  I read it closely to make sure I was reading it right so of course we went! The line time was 30 minutes, and yes we waited patiently!  By the time we got up to order they had understandably run out of many options for the kids  but we ordered the cheese pizza and the mac n cheese with fries so that worked out. I ordered the Gyro with Greek salad and a small drink. I was charged about $18 and some change I didn't want to ask about anything as to not hold up the never ending line so I grabbed a seat and got out drinks I asked a man who worked there who seemed like a manager if they had stopped doing the kids eat free at a certain time and he said she took off one kids meal because it is with the purchase of an adult meal, that was not stated on their advertisement and it was not mentioned to me.  I just said ok and let it go and sat down even though there was a significant discrepancy. There was another man working there he was on his phone a lot moving around and cleaning up, my guess is he was the owner or a manager.. either way he was very pushy and quite rude to guests. We are sitting at the table and he is clearing it up as we are eating and as soon as we were done and I was putting things in a box to go he was hovering over me trying to take the plates out of my hands I mean as busy as it was there were plenty of empty tables!  I have worked in the restaurant business so I understand being busy and stressed out but seriously back off until the guest is completely through or ask \" is there anything I can get out of the way\" He was kind of snappy to the staff when it didn't seem necessary, His whole demeanor seemed irritated and pushy which I'm absolutely sure he was stressed it was crazy busy but as a \"professional\" I feel like he should have handled it better!  I would probably go back on a not so busy day  if I happened to be going to the aquarium not for the environment or atmosphere but for the food"}
{"text":"Service was ok but it was all a front. They advertise kids eat free but their portions are for 2 years old and below! You can't get the kids eat free with the coupons, lady still charged me for one of my kids meal. Do not recommend and will not be back, good was not good either..... not authentic Greek!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food and gluten free beer is always enjoyable while you watch the different events westgate has right outside for entertainment. Ask for Letty, she's the best!"}
{"text":"Kids Eat Free! It's true. Kids eat free here on most days! As a Mom of a toddler who rarely finishes a meal, I appreciate this so much! Not to mention, their Greek food is delicious! I loved the Chicken Gyro and what is it about Greek french fries that make them so good? Their hummus is spot on and the pitas are soft and delicious. Located next to Odysea Aquarium, this is a quick and yummy food option for you before or after your visit. You order at the counter and can either eat inside or outside. They have tvs with sports on for Dads, along with alcohol should Dad need it to get through the family-fun day! :) This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the complex. Glad to have them around! PS - they also deliver through Uber Eats!"}
{"text":"If you're going to make your customers wait 30 minutes for their food, don't argue with them about what is considered a reasonable wait, especially if you're going to charge them almost $50. I won't be trying their other locations because of this."}
{"text":"My fav!! Their food is always super fresh and tasty. And the baklava cheesecake is amazing. We go here frequently because the food is good and we enjoy their patio. The rewards plans the have is also very generous. Opa!!!"}
{"text":"New ownership and revamped look replaced our tired old Greek spot. Glad they did! New look is nice and clean. Menu is updated to include breakfast and coffee, portions good, and the food was as tasty as ever! Gyro and Greek fries were great. Nice patio too! Seems like the new ownership has it headed in a positive direction. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place out since we were in the area. We were extremely pleased! The food was even better than we expected it to be, and the service was great as well. I ordered the caprese pita that one of the managers recommended, and it was to die for! There are so many options, you can't go wrong coming here!"}
{"text":"I will start off saying that my husband and I have made it a business to try as many gyro places as we can to find one that revels closest to The Greek Pita (N Phoenix).  I looked on yelp when I started my new job to see what I could find.  This place showed up and the reviews were off the chart.  Today, I decided it was time (there is another place in the Fry's parking lot that I tried previously and would give 3-4 stars to)....I now wonder two things. 1. if everyone that is going here is stoned and just has the munchies or 2. If I somewhere along the way have been so spoiled by my place that every other gyro place will never make it out alive.    Let's start with the basics.  The place itself is in a great strip area on Baseline.  It's got a fabulous patio setup and you walk inside to a huge (unexpected) clean restaurant.  It was more than half empty on a Friday during lunch hour though...maybe that should have been a clue to bail...but I stayed since I had already ordered my food via phone in.    Food.  The quantity of the food content is great.  My to-go container was FULL.  I looked at it for a moment and then I started to LOOK at it.  The first thing I noticed was it looked like they forgot my tzansiki (sp?) sauce.  I was like okay, well that sucks, but went to eat anyways.  The sauce was there, but it was more of a water down yogurt dressing with little seasoning to it.  No cucumber, dill, lemon taste at all (and had it been better, this could have easily changed my stars).  Because the sauce was put directly on the pita, I couldn't pick it up at all so I had to use a knife and fork.  I thought that was weird.  The meat was ok.  I'll be honest, I can usually taste the marry of the beef and lamb, but I'm not even sure I got both and I definitely didn't get a lot of meat on it.  It tasted like overcooked, under seasoned beef.  It had a weird red coloring on it also, but there was no flavor with it.  The abundaince of my gyro was a lot of shredded lettuce and tomato (it's a gyro, not a taco).  The fries were basic, fries with no salt and kind of soggy (probably from my soggy pita bread).    So there you have it.  I would say I'm going to try it again, but like I said, there is another place almost directly across the street with better sauce and meat...a little more price (like $1) but that would be work it.  A short tip, as about another cup or two to your sauce with some lemon, dill and CUCUMBERS for your sauce, learn to salt and pepper a bit and parchment paper to separate fries from gyro (if you can't sauce on top) and I might be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, atmosphere fun, employees where attentive.  But it was too far from the handicapped  parking lot"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had to wait forever for my food and what made it worst people who ordered after me already got their food. Not only that they forgot to add pita bread."}
{"text":"Delicious pitas!!  Hubbie had the Philly gyro with mushrooms and peppers. A huge pile of meat is always his favorite. I had the chicken pita and Greek fries. The garlic sauce and Parmesan on the fries were a little overwhelming for me but did taste good. I think next time I'll ask if the can put the garlic and parm sauce on my chicken pita and leave the fries plain. But still oh so good. Hubbie wants to make this his go to place for game days. Plan ahead though. Service was a tad slow but worth it."}
{"text":"Best Greek food ever I've been coming here a lot because of how good they make their food, the employees are very friendly and never upset you. The pita with hummus taste amazing and the atmosphere is so chill. I will always come here regularly because it's that good."}
{"text":"Outstanding the chicken plate was great!!! The staff very friendly!!!! Great place to eat!!!!"}
{"text":"OPA is the only restaurant open at Westgate early. All the other restaurants don't open until 11am. We were in the mood for mimosas and good food! We got just that...I ordered the salmon wrap with my lemon Dijon on the side (I like to identify how much I want on my sandwich) and Greek fries! It was excellent!!!! My mom got the chicken wrap and salad which she loved!!! My sister got the make your own omelet and hash browns. Our stomachs were full with some to take home because their portion sizes are plentiful! If you haven't stopped in there you need to! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good place to come here for brunch.  This place opens one hour earlier than other restaurants nearby and they serve breakfast. Unlike popular breakfast places, no lines, no waits. Nothing is open around them, really ideal place to come for late leisurely breakfast.  We were the first customers to arrive and we were there for a while after we finished our food, just chatted over a cup of coffee. By the time we were ready to leave, other stores and restaurants started opening up.   Food portion is very generous. It got a bit too much after a while.  You order at a counter and they bring you food and drinks. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this place out randomly the other evening, and they were open on a Monday, which was nice. The place had a nice atmosphere, was clean and inviting, and the food was spectacular! We even arrived in time for the tail end of happy hour! The gyro and the Greek fries I highly recommend, as well as the falafel pita sandwich and the salad. Definitely going to go back, maybe when there's live music playing. Opa!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a quick healthy bite to eat before heading out to Sedona - Grand Canyon - Las Vegas Labor Day weekend trip. Food was excellent. Customer service was top notch. Owner and staff were very friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very surprised by how good the food was here. Not the biggest Greek food fan but my wife was dying to go. After going, I would stop by this joint again and again. We ordered the chicken souvlaki kabob with lemon sauce and the beef souvlaki pita with tzatziki sauce. Both were very moist, the sauces were wonderful and the pita bread was great. The sides were all good. For dessert, we tried the baklava cheesecake and the caramel brownie. I was really excited for the cheesecake and it was just average for me. It had a strong taste of cinnamon and just missed the mark for me. The brownie on the other hand was awesome and had great flavor. Service was good and I liked having the television available to catch glimpses of the Sunday night football game while out with my wife. Do not tell her I was watching. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Staff are awesome very friendly, restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated.The food is very fresh and tasty, Greek fries love them,gyro was delicious salad are great. The portions are just right and the desserts are yummy."}
{"text":"We ordered the florentine pizza and the moussaka. The pizza was fantastic and if definitely order that again. The moussaka itself was not very good. The flavors just weren't there and the texture of the potato inside was strange. The pita bread it came with, the greek fries , and the veggies were all great though.   The place had a nice atmosphere and the servers were all pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I come atleast a few times a month. Service is amazing food is delicious and their mules are on point.  Whether it's lunch with the girls or swinging by for a drink at night this place is on point.  I love the pitas and the chicken is melt in your mouth. Alan is also our favorite that we see every lunch time!"}
{"text":"Oh man 2nd time I ordered here and it is truly the bomb! Watch out for the greek fries, they are insanely addicting!"}
{"text":"Great food, Super casual. Staff is always helpful and friendly. Locally owned. If you get nothing but the Greek fries you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our food was excellent but the cashier, who I suspect was the owner, showed us even better hospitality and customer service. Definitely will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were shopping in the area and decided to try this for lunch. I had the Gyro Burger with a side salad and the food was great!!! Service was good as well. We will definitely eat there again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today. The appetiser and main dish were decent but not great. We went back up and ordered 2 deserts. We waited nearly 40 minuets before they arrived . One correct item and one incorrect . I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Este lugar se gana las 5 estrellas en calidad, cantidad y precio , mi comida estuvo muy rica, ordene el opa chicken wrap, grilled chicken pita y chicken soulvlaki off the grill, las papistas estaban crunchy y el sabor del pollo Fue algo increíble , si quieren comer muy muy rico vengan a Opa Life Greek Cafe"}
{"text":"Good was always really good and the staff seems to have fun. Great environment and great place to go for lunch during the week as well."}
{"text":"Nice little Cafe, they have a nice outdoor patio to sit on which was perfect today! No waiters, you order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. They forgot to bring out one of our items but we were full and they gave us a cash refund and apologized so no biggie!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the staff is nice, although when you go and it's busy it can be hard to find seating when the bands are there.   The man who books the bands takes a table that could seat 4 or more people and he does not offer it to anybody looking for a seat. He sits there with a water bottle and doesn't let others sit there when he could be sitting at the bar or a table meant for 2."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Their food is great. The staff is awesome, very friendly and will make suggestions if you are not sure what you want. Their Greek fries are amazing. On the weekends they are sometimes packed but it is to be expected because they are in Westgate, but the longer lines are well worth the wait. I have suggested that a few of my friends should stop in for really good food there."}
{"text":"\"Check Yelp first...\" and \"we know just the place!\" That's how the sayings go, right?  Usually, Yelp reviews are spot on too... except for every once in a while when they aren't.  The latter was the case last week when I checked Yelp first and found what looked like a solid Greek Cafe located close to a business my husband and I were heading to for a meeting.  Unfortunately, OPA Life Greek Cafe did not live up to it's four star rating.  The overall experience was not good...  We ordered to Greek Salads with Chicken and a hummus appetizer.  We found the prices to be very expensive considering the poor quality of the food we received.  The chicken in the salads was rubbery.  The hummus was bland and a weird texture.  The dressings tasted like they were store bought and filled with chemicals.    The girls working were friendly, and I like restaurants like this with a fast casual environment, but I like them a lot more when the food tastes good and the price reflects the quality... I will not be back.  So sorry OPA!"}
{"text":"Walking distance from my house! The food comes fast and delicious! I have eaten there twice and very impressed! Greek salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows what Greek food should taste like should avoid this place, not good at all. The Gyro reminded me of something one might get at a gas station, you know, next to the 3 day old hot dogs and pump cheese. This is not Gyro meat, it is some kind of \"Gyro\" looking meat but is most certainly not the real deal. Charging what you do for the \"cheap\" food you provide is reason enough for me not to come back or recommend to anyone. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"So my very first experience here was extremely pleasant.  They had amazing customer service and their food tasted great. However, my most recent experience was one out of the pits of hell. I actually work in the area and often went to this place for their chai tea drink being that it's my favorite and they have soy as an option. Now when I went this employee named Alan K must've had the case of the Monday's. Right off the bat he had a horrible attitude and was extremely rude! I asked for a chai latte and asked if they had soy. He told me \"I hope so\" with a rude tone. Well shit I hope you do too and hope you know what you have in stock being that you work there. Once he made it, it tasted nothing like a chai latte. It tasted like an iced coffee so I asked him if he could remake it. Through the whole time he was remaking my drink he kept bickering with me that it's going to taste the same because he's going to make it the same way. I told him that chai tea has more of a cinnamon taste and not a coffee taste and he continued to make these rude facial expressions trying to argue with me. Eventually he remade it and it tasted slightly better than the original drink. That experience alone was just a huge disappointment and frankly the customer service there from their employee Alan was the absolute worst! It's unfortunate since I really liked the place but after that experience I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch and they were not busy.  We placed our order and waited a long time. About 3O minutes.  The four stars is because once we got our food it was amazing. Took off a star due to the extended wait."}
{"text":"I was impressed.  I had the lamb and chicken skewers w/ rice and calamari and of course a Greek style mule.  This was very fresh and tasty Greek food and the portions were on point!!  Next time I'm going to try the gyros."}
{"text":"Came early to grab some grub before the T.Swift concert!!  Yardhouse was a 1-1/2 wait!  So the girls decided to walk around and saw this place was buzzing but still had tables.  I ordered the pesto chicken pita with fries...  YUM!!!  And we shared an Opa Life Combo for appetizers:  Spanikopita, Tzatziki, Hummus, Dolmathes & Keftedes.  I have to say, it was GOOD Greek food!"}
{"text":"Got take out.  Food was ready very quickly. It was hot and delicious. Service was friendly"}
{"text":"We visited the Odysea a few days ago and had a great lunch at Opa Life Greek Cafe. Service and food were both great, the skewers were excellent and the kids loved the pizza. We forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Crispy greek fries were awesome! Ambiance is set off by the live music.  My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"We've been here the past few nights and order pick-up! The Greek salad with salmon is my absolute favorite- I can't get enough of it! My fiancé also has the Greek salad but with chicken!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! My friend and I were in the hurry to catch a movie and this place was quick and delish. We ordered wine and 2 appetizers. We got the calamari, which as an Italian calamari snob I must say was so scrumptious. We also ordered the Greek meatballs which was perfect to split between two people as we each got 3 pieces. Usually they give odd portions, so I was glad that it was equal servings. Definitely coming back! Great people and super friendly."}
{"text":"I visited on a Saturday night and ordered a souvlaki plate with greek fries and greek side salad. All were absolutely delicious! Well seasoned and fresh tasting. So good that I returned a few days later for lunch and was I disappointed the 2nd time around.  This time I ordered rice instead of fries. Rice was just yellow rice...not the yellow jasmine I expected. My grilled veggies were not slightly charred but they were burnt crisp! I ordered my lunch to-go and the side salad was placed in the same container as my steaming hot/burnt food. In the few minutes drive back to the office I had hot salad which I had to separate from the rice. Somewhere in \"restaurant school\" they have to teach you not to mix cold salad and hot food in same to-go container.  I'm hoping my lunch experience was a fluke.  I'm willing to try one more time before I cross it off.  Great customer service"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! We had the jalapeno cilantro hummus, a gyro, and a California pita. Everything was really good, including the fries and Greek salad on the side. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious, price is reasonable, fresh ingredients and I highly recommend this place. They also have a location inside arrowhead mall at the food court :)"}
{"text":"Better than I expected.   Positives: I got the chicken souvlaki with salad and veggies and my husband got beef souvlaki gyro with Greek fries. (Sauce on the side).  I have to say I wasn't sure what to expect since I did my best to order healthy. First bite was of the veggies and wow they were good! Needed a tad of salt but cooked perfectly with great flavor. The Greek salad was very yummy as well. My chicken skewers were extremely moist and full of flavor.  I was not jealous of my husbands gyro like I thought I'd be! Although that also was wonderful. The beef was cooked on point and was tender. The bread was really soft and I loved the fries!!!    Next was the dessert.. Brownie and baklava cheesecake. I only took one bite but the brownie was delicious.   Negatives: I was dying to try the baklava cheesecake and I have to say it was a let down. It had too much cinnamon for my liking.  We were not really happy with the wait time for our food.. But once the good arrived we agreed it was worth it. I would go back."}
{"text":"Very impressive ! Food was fresh and very good!  Chicken was juicy and well cooked ! The sauce that was on the chicken was different but loved it"}
{"text":"Love the decor but the food does not match. This place is the American version of Greek food. I ordered a Greek salad with gyro meat. However the dressing on the salad was Cesar. That is not what goes on a Greek salad. Greek fries? They put a mixture mayonnaise on top. Again, that is not Greek. Everything was under seasoned and just not original. Only giving 2 stars for the for friendliness of their staff."}
{"text":"This establishment has absolutely wonderful food and very friendly staff. I ordered a chicken caesar wrap with a greek salad on the side. Both items were very very delicious and fresh in flavor and ingredients. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in search of delicious Greek food at a reasonable price. I love the new happy hour menu too. What a great spot to stop before the movies or a sporting event. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is definitely solid. Despite the fact that the \"chicken souvlaki\" is really chicken kebab, everything here is good. I The chicken is good, as are the pieces of pita that come with it. But the stars of the show may be the veggies and the Greek salad. Everything is really fresh and tastes great. I like it more each time I go.  I think two $ is overstating how much this place costs. Most of their sandwiches and such are under $10, and the few plate items that are over $10 are just over $10."}
{"text":"This place is great. We have been here about 5 times.  The food is delicious.  We love the great customer service  and of course our favorite is Jay. He is our go to guy. We will return."}
{"text":"40 minutes to \"cook\" a salad? \"It will be about twenty minutes\", the guy said. That's okay. They were clearly busy.  Forty minutes later -- still no food, and time for us to leave for the hockey game when, the food arrives!  My pork souvlaki pita had three small nuggets of pork inside. It was less meat than a small hotdog, and with a black, bitter, and hard exterior. I think I cracked a filling. It sure hurt when I bit down. I regret going to this place."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant about a year ago, nothing to die for, gotta say the bbq lamb was bout the best thing. A Bit pricy for 2 people."}
{"text":"Eh.. was not that great for us, fairly expensive for what you get. Lady at the register seemed annoyed because we were taking to long to order."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have a new restaurant at Westgate. The décor and setup is very modern and inviting. We also enjoyed the craft beer selection.The food was good, but very overpriced for the actual portions and accoutrements. I ordered the Village salad with Gyro meat, the salad came out to $17,and although somewhat large, underwhelming for that price! My husband got the gyro with a salad, and that too was disappointing, there was hardly any meat in his $10+ gyro. Unless the prices were just higher for an event (Coyotes game same night)...we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Nope nope nope. Hair in the food, food tasted bad, and we ordered one brand of beer but we were given a totally different kind. Don't get me started on the girl at the register."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went on Friday.  We love Greek food so when we found out this place opened we were all for it.    The food was great. HOWEVER, staff might need more training on the menu. When we saw that loukoumades was on option on the menu we jumped right on it.  We were happy we didn't have to wait until the next Greek festival to have some.  When we asked the person taking our order how many were in an order she looked at us and said its just one big round ball.  Umm yea, we then explained to her what they were and she then took a moment to go ask how many were in an order.  I'm so used to biting into a loukoumades and having the honey burst out in all places (so darn good!!), yeah not happening here though :( :(.  We'll just have to wait until the next Greek festival to get our fix.  The rest of the food was fine, nothing out of this world, but it was good."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The restaurant is modern and clean.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The food is delicious and beautiful.  Yes I did say \"beautiful\".  I ordered a simple gyro pita and side Greek salad.  I received this beautifully presented and colorful meal that delighted my senses!  I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes or would like to try Greek food.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the gyros here and was ordering delivery quite a bit last year. But when I went to order tonite, it looks like they're not on GrubHub or Eat24 anymore.   That's really too bad because I love the food! If you're in their area, stop by to eat. You won't be disappointed.  I'm just gonna have to wait a while since I don't often have time to go in and eat. :("}
{"text":"Well this wasn't a good night for Opah. Normally the lamb is tasty and tender. Tonight was very, very tough! We were dissatisfied with the quality. We mentioned it to the staff and he said that he will let the kitchen know about the cook time?! I guess. Any way not a good night! I hope the quality isn't being placed on the back burner. Makes it a a questionable spot now!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots, kinda surprised I haven't written a review. Now they have a parking spot out front for take out pick up orders. I really enjoy the Greek fries. I've also had the Greek burger. My plan next is too try the tiramusu cheesecake. Staff is great."}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is something we love and we wanted to try OPA Life Greek Cafe.  When we entered the cafe there were hardly anyone but in half an hour there were people walking in. Well we ordered the hummus trio, Greek coffee and Baklava. We chose Garlic roasted, sun-dried tomatoes and bell peppers for Hummus. Must say they all tasted really good. Sun-dried tomatoes had a great flavor. I remove a star for the quantities of the pita given. There was so much of hummus on plate with hardly any pita. It was my first time trying Greek coffee it was surely a good attempt, had good cinnamon savor. I remove a star for the Baklava, it was not what i expected. I felt it was not fresh enough, the layers were sticky and it was way too sweet. I would still go to Haji Baba for Baklava.   Overall it was an ok experience as for the food is concerned. Price range is on the higher side compared to other cafes. Service was really good which was impressive. Place is calm and cozy for a good date."}
{"text":"Was in town on business and found this place on Yelp. Very glad I did. That area of Tempe seemed to be lacking decent eateries. This place is a great spot. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. The girl at the front desk was super nice and helpful. Food came out very fast, but the quality wasn't \"fast food\" quality. It's very good, sit down restaurant quality. I had the chicken souvlaki plate. Chicken was seasoned & cooked to perfection. The hummus was great and the steamed veggies were very tasty. They also have a nice selection of beer, wine & a full bar. In the bar area of the restaurant they have a bunch of TV's to catch a game. Will definitely be back if I'm ever in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I order delivery here thru Uber eats when I'm not in the mood to cook. I usually get the Ceasar wrap or chicken wrap, Both are great. Garlic fries w/cheese are great. The jalapeño hummus is my favorite w/pita. I always recommend this place because it's fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is always nice and relaxing. The food is good, even though the chicken pita I got was messy to eat, it was still good. The side salad was better than I expected for a side dish. My only complaint is the water here isn't very good at all, but there are plenty other drink options."}
{"text":"Best Greek fries I've had in the valley! Great gyros also. The portions are ample and the food is fresh.  If you are a hard core coffe e drinker you have to try the Greek coffee. It's not for coffee wimps though.  You order at the counter them they bring your order to your table. It is not fast food so it may take 10-15 min but your food will be fresh!"}
{"text":"Found this gem randomly while in Tempe and the food is delicious. My husband and I spilt a gyro with Greek fries and it was plenty of food for both of us. They have live music on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We plan to come back and check that out. The women that work there are very nice and have some of the best customer service."}
{"text":"Hubbie and I decided to go there because I had a Groupon to try this place.   We love Greek food and we eat it every weekend and this was kind of a dissapointment. First of all the restaurant's set up like a sit down place but it's more like a \"sit wherever you want- we'll bring your food to your table when it's ready\" place.  No problem. Just confusing.  We go to the counter to order our food and apparently they have some kind of points system where you get a latte after like $40 spent there, you get it. Anyway, the customer who was ordering before us wanted to use this point system and he wasn't being given credit for them. He explained to the staff this is the second time he's had issues with this. They apologized in a very lame way and when he left, they proceeded to make fun of him in front of us. Like seriously? So unprofessional!  If you offer something like this for  regular customers you'd think they want customers to come back right?  Red flag for first time customers like us.  The decor of the place's beautiful,  specially outside during a cold night because you can sit by their big firepit or under a patio heater.  The food... Well it was OK. The Greek fries were greasy, so oily and the gyro pita wasn't memorable. They don't fold it and wrap it like you'd expect and there's so much shredded iceberg lettuce on top you can barely taste the meat.  Overall we wouldn't recommend this place and most likely won't be eating there again simply because of what we saw in terms of customer service when making fun of the previous customer and also because their food's not really Greek food.  If you want Greek food you're better off going to Greek Gyro Express by Sams club in Avondale or to Pita Kitchen in W. McDowell across the Costco plaza."}
{"text":"This Greek food was excellent. Their hummus was really fresh, and the plate was large. I also took the advice of the beautiful waitress who suggested the pesto chicken Pita. It was really fresh and made healthy."}
{"text":"Decided to give Opa a try on Mother's Day for the first time ever. I went with the Beef Souvlaki Pita with the Skewer sauce and I definitely was not disappointed. The beef was tender and marinade tasty yet not overdone. The sauce was a nice accent and did not overpower the taste of the meat and vegetables. My mom had the Philly pita with chicken and while that is not my thing when I want a pita it was very tasty also. The chicken was cooked well without being dried out."}
{"text":"The food at this place is phenomenal! The portions are adequate and the meats are perfectly cooked. The pita bread is flavorful and served warm. I went for an early lunch and it wasn't crowded but the service took longer than average, about 20 minutes to get my food. In any case very worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am a total regular at Opa Life - amazing food and an OUTSTANDING patio area, away from traffic noise. Great place for casual business meetings.  We also get Opa life from Uber Eats too!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool. You have the choice of sitting inside or outside. The food was really good quality and really good. The staff were friendly and fun with good personalities and super accommodating. I will definitely be returning. May have found my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Really great place to grab a quick lunch at, with great prices as well.   I got the gyro, my date ordered the falafel. They were both excellent. The service was really fast and friendly. We both definitely left more than full!"}
{"text":"First time here but I've bee looking for a good Greek place close to home. This place is AWESOME. I was shocked that there was live music!! And they have local beer on draft!! I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"What great service! Jey made the experience great and enjoyable! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Fresh authentic food, great service. Try Greek salad and pork souvlaki!"}
{"text":"Hockey and Greek food go well together at Opa Life.  My wife and I stopped by Opa Life when the restaurant we wanted to go to was eerily empty on a Hockey Game night but that's another review.  Good thing for us; Opa Life was a great find.  We apparently arrived right before the surge of Hockey fans.  Opa Life made me think of a Greek version of Pei Wei.  You order at the counter and then servers bring your food after you sit.  The atmosphere is good, but can get a little noisy (hockey fans are a rowdy bunch).  We ordered a Philly Pita/Greek Fries and a Euro Pita with Greek Salad.  And we added a Baklava Cheesecake for dessert.   Our choices were spot on for us.  My Philly Pita had some of the best meat I've ever had and it's mix with cheese and onions was great.  My Greek Fries were also excellent.  The combination of perfect fries with Feta and Parmesan Cheese was way tasty.  My wife's Euro Pita and Greek Salad were just as tasty.  We shared fries and salad and it was heaven.  The only issue we had was that the serving size of both Pita's are really large.  We did manage to come close to finishing but it took time to enjoy each bite.  We will totally split a Pita, Fries and salad the next time we go.  As for dessert; we saw the Baklava Cheesecake in the dessert  case and thought that would be a great finish.  One piece was perfect for splitting.  The flavors of the authentic Baklava come through along with a really good cheesecake.  Fila strips on top added a great crunch along with honey.  We will make sure this is on our list for game day Hockey and Football."}
{"text":"I was trying to find something to eat and noticed Opa life had moved into the old big fat Greek. I decided to try them out and placed an order to go, 20 minutes later after I saw people who came in after receiving food and I was still waiting and losing time to eat before I had to start work again. I went up and asked what was going on and all I heard was sorry from the server not even the cook, or the person that took my order just the random server... From the time I complained my order it took them 3-4 minutes to get it in a bag and have me on my way. So they basically wasted almost half my lunch break because of unorganized individuals who didn't seem to care. The food was ok bit expensive, 1 chicken gyro and side salad was a little under 9 bucks. I prefer Pita Shack since it's better tasting and more cost effective AND they don't forget about my order and make me wait over 20 minutes for a chicken gyro and salad... I have them 2 stars because the server was really apologetic but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ridiculous service. Ordered a Caesar wrap, no one in line. After 6 more ppl came up, order and received their food I finally just mention that I had ordered a wrap. The lady tells me \"okay he's going to start it now\" okay no one is perfect, no worries. So then I proceed to watch him make all the orders before mine yet again. I then politely asked for my money back. The girl on the register was very polite. The others saw me standing and waiting, giving angry stares. Wtf would I be sitting staring at you?? I'm waiting for my food."}
{"text":"Dry delicious food... one of my favorite restaurants in westgate... clean and good environment"}
{"text":"I haven't tried but a couple of Greek restaurants so that's the only reason I didn't give a 5 star. Had lunch with the wife and the food was fantastic. I had the gyro pita and it was loaded with meat. The only thing that wasn't great, was too much olive oil was on it. My wife ordered the Opa gyro burger and it was huge! It was so large she had to ask to get it cut in half. I didn't try it myself but it looked good. Half pound burger loaded with gyro meat, she barely finished half. Saved the rest for dinner. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Always a welcoming spot. Great service, great food. Always fresh and clean.  Their Greek Salad is amazing, and/or their greek fries."}
{"text":"The place is pretty and located on an attractive venue, but the food and service were subpar.  I ordered a 24 oz tea and a sliced gyro.  The clerk asked me if I was sure I needed two cups (as I was clearly by myself) since the tea had free refills. Confused, I said that I only needed one glass.  Worse still, she ordered me a plate of gyro meat instead of a gyro, and had the audacity to lecture me on the appropriate way to order next time.  My food was cold.  There will not be a next time"}
{"text":"The owner at this place is awesome! Him and the rest of his staff were very welcoming. If you ever walk into this place make sure to order the Grecian Delight Pizza. I honestly think is the best pizza I've had! Along with having a few free coffee samples by the owner, the place looked really nice and clean. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the other reviews, I'm simply appalled at the criteria by which patrons judged this restaurant. I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend who had been a frequent visitor of BFGE. We were amazed at the atmosphere and selection. The food was spectacular and leaps and beyond better in terms of quality than BFGE. The price point matches the quality of food, along with the area. Please take the time to read every review thoroughly rather than view the rating. Most people ranked this place harshly low for minor inconveniences including price comparisons to BFGE, which had inferior food. Either way, give this place a chance."}
{"text":"TERRABLE unhappy staff! Had a great family time at the aquarium. Was walking along and the owner or door guy jumped on us while walking by. (Should have been red flag #1) but we live Greek food so hey why not. We grab a table sit down and are not told ever you need to order at the counter and they give you a number . So take my happy self up there to a rude cashier. Lady ahead of me was asking simple recommend kind of questions. She finally got frustrated and just gave up. As I'm ordering I note everything is extra. $1.00 add on here and there for me to get soup and hummus with pita bread I paid over $25. Then $3.00 small drink. Yikes. Food wasn't anything to write home about. DO NOT GET THE garlic hummus you will regret it. The soup was over powered with lemon as well.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Opa chicken, salmon are my favorites. Best fries too!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed lunch here. I had a Gyro with lamb and beef, it had a ton of lettuce and not a whole lot of meat and not enough tziki sauce but it was tasty.  The Greek fries were pretty awesome, crispy shoestring style fries with a lemon, parm and feta type sauce on top."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I'm back for the second day in a row. I will miss it when I go home. The Greek salad is really fresh and the souvlaki is very flavorful. The portions are gigantic, so order sides if you're not a big eater."}
{"text":"Just stopped here for dinner, first timers at this establishment. So, far service is good and food brought outstanding a new place for my family to eat at. Food options are different, always looking for new places for dining."}
{"text":"My employees and I love to come to OPA in the mornings for our weekly meetings. The coffee is fantastic and the greek fries can not be beaten. The employees are always upbeat, friendly and welcoming which is another big reason we keep coming back. The atmosphere is very good here as well, good music, multiple TVs and even sometimes live music. With the exception of the live music is it rarely too loud making it a good productive work environment. Overall a very relaxed, fun and clean environment that we at Clean Air Lawn Care would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times, the food is always amazing and never disappoints! It is a fun local spot and also provides great and fun entertainment with live music! I love this local spot!"}
{"text":"This is the grossest food I've ever had. The only thing authentic about this \"Greek\" place is that they are cheap with ketchup. I don't understand how they have 4 1/2 stars???  This is worse than dog food. Greasy fries. Mac and cheese was watered down cheese sauce. There was blood splatter on our appetizer plate of hummus. None of us finished our food. 40 for 2 gyros plates and a kids Mac and cheese. Not worth it. Sooooo gross. This place violates several health code regulations."}
{"text":"Me and my friend love Greek food. The food is great here and trust me, we've tried a lot of places.   The Greek fries are always... ALWAYS on point!! They make them crispy so fries don't end up soggy. I had my steak medium well and it came out perfect, full of flavor. The salad was ok. Besides the regular fountain drinks, they have a couple options of really good brewed teas and different coffees.   I haven't tried the desserts but they look really good and I have heard good things. Certain evenings they had live music. The atmosphere is very welcoming. They also have an outside seating area with a heater for the chilly nights. The only thing I have to say is prices are a little pricey. Overall I would recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service has a lot to be desired.   We ordered four meals and received three.  My family had finished eating and they were still asking what sides I had ordered with my meal.   So sad to have ruined a nice experience by forgetting one meal.  I had to ask  for a refund of the meal they forgot!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Cute waitresses. What more could you ask for? Kabobs and gyros you can't go to wrong..........."}
{"text":"Good food, very  tender meat. The salad was good and the pork souvalki and gyro were both good. The tiramisu was good too, wasn't Day of fresh, but probably only a day old."}
{"text":"Get a side of vegetables. They're so good here!   The owner loves finding good live bands to come play which is perfect for the open L-shaped floor plan. The food is always on point and it's not the cheapest, but definitely worth the extra quarters.   Love that they do coffee too...dark chocolate mocha!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the location at Arrowhead mall a couple of times but this was our first time dining here at Westgate. Upon walking in I was shocked to find that it's a counter serve spot which is cool by me. You order and then choose a table and they bring the food out to you. We chose to sit out on the patio because the weather is still really great and they honestly have such an awesome patio for a more casual spot.   Our service was really great by everyone who helped us. It was a nice quiet Wednesday evening at Westgate for people watching and enjoying the shady patio here at Opa. Now onto the best part, the food. I had the beef slouvaki wrap.  My husband decided to take a chance on something he never had before and ordered their Greek pasta that resembles a lasagna.  We both really enjoyed our food but the best part was the sides!  Their Greek salad and Greek fries are both incredibly delicious. I love Greek food and Opa did not disappoint!  I look forward to being a regular at this spot."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great restaurant- the food was fantastic, service was wonderful and we came in on a live music night. We are visiting from our of town and we plan on coming back before we go home!"}
{"text":"We are cared for very well every single time we come here from day one.  The food never disappoints.  The jazz nights are top notch and bring a fun electric atmosphere.  And if you are looking for a special kind of dessert, the baklava cheesecake will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Been to several Opa Life restaurants and this is my favorite.  The hummus is perfect, pita bread is cooked just right and they have consistently good pitas. My daughter had the Pita Pizza and finished it. Friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Finally gave OPA a try. This is not as great as I thought it would be. Food looks great and wonderful but lacks flavor. Our meats were completely bland and dry. There is so much lettuce in their gyro and wrap you can make another salad with it. I personally have never had a gyro with lettuce but this is how we got it. The gyro bread was so soaked with olive oil it had fell apart. Had to eat it like a salad anyway. The gyro meat tasted like cheap frozen meatball slices. There was no sign of tzatziki sauce at all in anything. So weird. My wrap was so full of lettuce it wouldn't close. It just looked wrapped for presentation. Chicken was not seasoned or marinated. I did not taste any greek flavors in anything. No need to pop a breath mint here... there was no sign of any good flavors and spices that lingered. So the reason I gave 2 stars was because the fries were good. Will I be back? Negatory. I will stick to my real greek friends that make the real deal."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week. Very convenient with good service and great food! I usually get the  Opa wrap or a Greek salad w chicken if I'm feeling  especially healthy... Good: food, nice people, clean and updated environment, jazz on weekends is awesome! Bad: the whole ordering everything at the counter is just awkward."}
{"text":"\"Damn, this Opa Life Pita is delicious, but it is filling!\"   *throws out the window at unsuspecting motorcyclist*   . . . If you get this reference, you win the Internets.   I was pretty bummed when My Big Fat Greek Express closed, so it's nice to see a new player in this space.   First, it must be said that Opa Life did a beautiful job transforming the place from cramped, dingy and tired to beautiful, clean and spacious. Amazing what a little TLC can do.   There's also patio seating now, which will be nice when the hot weather dies down a bit.  Dude and I swung by tonight for a quick dinner before a movie at Arizona Mills.   It's very similar to the previous establishment; counter service with self serve drinks.  The lady working the front of the house was quick to greet us, ask us if we've been in before, and made suggestions.    Both of us got the \"Opa Time!\" special ($9.95, $2 increase from MBFGRE): A Pita of your choice and Greek Salad or Fries ($1 extra for Greek Style). Dude got the Philly Style Gyro; myself, the Classic Gyro, both with a Greek Salad.   As mentioned earlier, these babies are STUFFED. As in, good luck getting your hands around it.  If this wasn't my first meal of the day, I probably would have shared!   The gyro meat was tender and well seasoned, and the Tzatziki sauce wasn't lacking in flavor. I was able to steal a bite of the Philly Style Gyro, and it was a tasty change bursting to full with all those mushrooms, peppers and cheese.   The dressing on the Greek salad was oil based, a nice change from the creamy, Ranch-y mess often used.   The only thing that was gross was the wax paper under the food was kind of getting all soggy. I guess it's better than eating off one of those bare trays . . . But, it'd be nice if they invested in some actual plates.   Don't miss daily Happy Hour from 3PM-7PM: $3 you call it draft beers . . . San Tan Products available, what?! It also includes $5 glasses of wine and $2 off any appetizer.   Glad to have a no frills Greek place back in the neighborhood - We'll be back for Happy Hour or before another movie date!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food ever!  The pizza is amazing.  Always a good vibe.  Food is so fresh And wait time is short. It's a little on the pricey side but worth every penny. If I could eat here every day I would!"}
{"text":"Great service! I had dinner here with my nephew after the yelp event at OdySea. I thought the vegetarian pizza was delicious. The ingredients were fresh, and the crust was perfect. They were having a special, so my nephew got to eat for free! There's also a check-in offer on the yelp app, so be sure to use it.  The place has plenty of seating areas, so it's great for groups."}
{"text":"Prompt service. Good food. The gyro pita with the greek salad was excellent.  Fies good. Cold brew coffee very good.  Grilled chicken salad very good!!"}
{"text":"Food tastes great, all fresh vegetables. The bread  on our pitas was fresh and full of flavor. The meat was cooked to perfection. Kids had a blast with the dinosaur models. Staff was really nice and genuinely cared about the experience. Prices are reasonable. Overall it was GREAT!"}
{"text":"We came here after an event a few months back.  Their set up was good, service was good. Over all I wasn't blown away by the food, but it was good.  They have no problem with portions!  You get a ton of it."}
{"text":"Let me preface this rating by saying, my husband loved his food.  He ordered the chicken souvlaki meal, with an extra shrimp skewer on the side.  He devoured his lunch, and totally enjoyed everything on his plate.  We started with the roasted garlic hummus, which was also quite tasty.  It was served along with warm pita points, and was a delightful way to start the meal.  Now, for me...I ordered the gyro with a Greek salad side.  I don't like onions on it, so I said no onions.  I had no idea they dumped a whole bunch of shredded lettuce on it, as well.  Oh well, that can be taken off.  Also, the pita is served flat, so when I folded it, the hard corner cracked a bit.  Not too much of an issue, I can deal with that.  However, I cannot deal with the oil that oozed out of the gyro continuously.  I'd take a bite, and it would squirt out all over my hand or shirt or table...lovely.  The gyro itself was meh...bland meat, sorta hard (and cracked) pita, tasteless tzatziki and lots of oil.  The only decent thing on it were the diced tomatoes, they tasted pretty good.  The Greek salad was also quite bland.  At first, I didn't think there was any dressing on it, then I realized...surprise, it was an oily light dressing.  Really, not what I was expecting.  Will I be back, probably not.  I told my hubby, he can go there when I'm not joining him for a meal.  And, by the way, I do love Greek food.  My thing is, when I go to a new Greek restaurant (or one I've never been to), I always get the gyro, since it's how I gauge whether I'm coming back, or not."}
{"text":"Good food, slow service even on a slow Tuesday night. They were out of mixed veggies and offered grilled veggies. Waited twenty five minutes."}
{"text":"I love the food better than Pitta Jungle is more authentic, tasteful and the atmosphere is beautiful especially when you can sit outside."}
{"text":"Westgate are sure having a tough time trying to bring in decent restaurants. I went there for the very first time last week and was not impressed. The food was very mediocre and very bland. There were hardly any customers in the restaurant but we had to wait for almost a half an hour for our meal. This place looks like a full-service restaurant but its served fast food style. The entrées  come in metal trays with paper on the bottom. You should never serve rice that has paper underneath as you were eating the rice and the paper was shredding and mixing in to the rice which was awful."}
{"text":"I didn't choose the Opa Life, the Opa Life chose me. No plate smashing here though!   Opa Life Cafe has reasonably priced Greek favorites, as well as various pita sandwiches and breakfast. The interior is nice and contemporary, with twinkling lights bordering the large patio outside, and spacious, uncluttered interior. There are 2 TVs here showing various channels and on certain nights they have live music (Jazz). We were here on a Saturday night when they had a live band and it was fairly busy as there was a constant stream of people trickling in to get to-go orders or dine in and enjoy the music.  I tried the grape leaves and roasted garlic hummus. Both were a sizable portion. The grape leaves were filled to the brim with well seasoned meat and rice. The sauce- Hellooo lemon! It was a bit too lemony/acidic for me but overall I enjoyed it. The hummus was smooth and had a creamy texture. I could taste a bit of the garlic but I didn't really like the addition of cumin to the hummus. They included a lot of pita bread to go with it which I appreciated.   Overall I enjoyed both dishes and I'll be back to try more Greek food."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food and service!! Was shocked how much food there was. Definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't get to visit the restaurant itself but I ordered a regular gyro from Uber eats. Omg it was absolutely delicious! You definitely get your money's worth with portion size and quality! I'm going to have to dine in soon. The only complaint that I have isn't even with the restaurant itself, but with Uber eats. The delivery guy was on a bicycle and he spilled the extra sauce they give you and it ripped the bag, and the Togo boxes were on their sides. Maybe next time could Opa life please put the extra sauce in the Togo box instead of the bag? Other than that, wonderful first impression"}
{"text":"Located at the Westgate in Glendale AZ next to UofP stadium. Great food and great service. Never disappointed while grabbing lunch here."}
{"text":"Great food. The staff need some work. They often help people out of turn in line. Pro tip: live music in a place this small doesn't need a sound system."}
{"text":"Was on the fence about this place but its a excellent restaurant. Its a little overpriced for what it is.   The Greek food here is delicious and well presented. but don't get the pizza (for the love of GOD don't get this pizzas, their terrible)  everything else I've had here is awesome.  Their salads are prepared just right and the Tzatziki sauce is yummy!!!! especially with pita bread!   The servers and waiters are kind and quick to respond to almost anything.  I think kids eat free on certain days here too.  They have outdoor sitting so you can enjoy the live music in the center of Westgate.   This place is a strong choice for families, couples, and friends.   I would give it 5 stars but they always mess up my to-go orders."}
{"text":"Very unorganized place!  Poor service and food took forever.  They need to get their act together - very frustrating..."}
{"text":"Obsessed with Opa Life's gyros! The meat is tender and seasoned to perfection. Their salads are fresh and flavorful too. Clean and comfortable with excellent service. I heard that they have one at Westgate that's much larger but I love the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Good food, great service :) we have eaten there twice now and both times were greeted at the door with smiles. They also have some amazing deserts"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Nice atmosphere.  I was excited to learn that they plan to begin serving Saganaki within the next month!  What's better than flaming cheese?!  Well, I guess flaming cheese with beer and fresh bread..."}
{"text":"Oh my glob.. best food ever. So tasty, affordable,great area & employees. And always clean. They have alcohol & fountain drinks. One of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. I highly recommend this restaurant. Especially their Greek fries. I love potatoes & cheese. Guess what's on these fries? Fricken cheese & special sauce for special people."}
{"text":"Talk about hitting the spot-we went there shortly after arriving in town for vacation and were hungry from traveling in and the time change.  The location is comfortable and is a great lunch spot.  My wife and I enjoyed our meals-she had the chicken souvlaki, I had the lamb souvlaki.  Very fresh ingredients and other than eating too many of my son's Greek fries, was a fairly healthy lunch.    My son's chicken souvlaki pita was ordered without sauce but had sauce on it-not a big deal, just swapped that chicken with my wife's souvlaki chicken.  The Greek fries mentioned above were great-they are the same fries that are served at our favorite Greek quick service restaurant at home, but come with a light olive oil drizzle and crumbled feta, and you know what they say about things served with feta..."}
{"text":"Way better than the old outdated Greek restaurant that use to be here. Great food and staff me and my family will be back soon.  I recommend the Greek fries soo good!!"}
{"text":"Was really impressed by the quality of their food. I had a Pita gyro with Greek fries and my wife had the grilled chicken souvlaki. Both dishes were amazing, the chicken was juicy, and the gyro meat was seasoned perfect. Their fries comes with a lemon mustard sauce and were one of the best greek fries I've ever. Although I do not live in west valley, I would come back just to eat here again. Honestly one of the best Greek places in the west valley."}
{"text":"Microwaving the Gyro meat is totally unacceptable. The meat was dry and tough but did have a nice flavor. What a shame."}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch with a group of six. The staff was very accommodating and they had a great sense of humor. I threatened a bad Yelp review if the owner let anyone else try and pay for the food other than myself, and to my delight he proceeded to yell at all of my friends obnoxiously from behind the register. He had us all rolling -  The food and drinks were great. Staff checked up on us repeatedly and brought us little treats to try from the bar and the bakery. Great experience. Clearly family owned. I don't care for Westgate at all, but I loved this place so now I have a reason to go back!"}
{"text":"If you want KRAFT MACARONI AND CHEESE  at a restaurant, this is the place to go!! Decided to get a quick meal for my child and macaroni cheese was the only selection for any pasta type dish on the kid's menu. And with a only a few sides to choose from as an option I reluctantly chose fries. When the food came out, what appeared before me was boxed macaroni on my plate! I was in disbelief. I asked the server, \"Is that Kraft macaroni that they made?\" To which the girl replied,  \"Yeah...well. ..that's how most restaurants make it.\" That made me even more irritated, that she would go as far to say that MOST restaurants use store bought macaroni, as if I was that ignorant! Not to mention, the fries were your standard Ore-ida frozen steak fries. I thought this place was going be authentic and fresh; I was sorely disappointed. I think I was even being on the nice side saying it was Kraft, for all I know it was store brand macaroni. I'm sure this is indicative of how they prepare the rest of their menu, with premade, frozen, out-of-the-box food."}
{"text":"The soup and the watermelon appetizer are my fave!  Food is fresh and delish!"}
{"text":"Always a perfect meal out. Food is excellent, staff does a great job and the restaurant is comfortable with both indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"First time coming here. I was really craving a Greek salad and ordered one to-go. When I arrived home my salad was just lettuce, feta, tomatoes, and a pepper. They completely forgot the dressing. It wouldn't have been such a big deal but I paid about 10$ for this salad and they got my order wrong. That's extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I were curious about this place because we usually skip it when we're at the mall. I'm not sure why that is but we decided to give it a try this time. We regret it, unfortunately. Our cashier was amazing. Explaining the menu and allowing my husband and I to tell him our story/experience about a hole in the wall Greek restaurant we went to in San Diego. We ordered a side of fries, a gyro wrap, a plate of pork meat on a skewer with some rice, a cheese cake, and three drinks. Our total came out to around $39 and some change. That's two trips to a cheap Asian buffet, but was expected. When it was time to pay, a small line of two people were behind us. The cook or owner was rushing the cashier to keep us moving. Not the best feeling in the world when I was given two pens to sign my receipt, and both of them did not work. Ended up scratching the receipt real hard instead. Our food took about 10 minutes. Everything was warm, like it was just reheated. The rice we were given was so hard! Like it wasn't cooked. The cheesecake was very basic. I would suggest jack in the box for the same taste and texture, but at a more affordable price (definitely lower than $6 I assure you). The fries were soggy, like they were sitting in the to-go-box for too long. The gyro wrap tasted very clean. Not too flavorful. Kind of like coleslaw, without the American twist.. (is coleslaw American? Idk.) overall, the food was filling, portions were decent, and the presentation looked appealing. The actual taste of the food though (price included)......... I would pass. One star for the kind and patient cashier. Not so much for the cook/owner though. We could definitely pass on him too."}
{"text":"One of Westgate's newer dining spots, Opa is a refreshing, fast-casual restaurant for your Greek food needs. It's lovely--absolutely GORGEOUS when the weather is nice, because when they open everything up, it;'s like one giant patio. Great view of the fountains, nice people watching, etc.   The good: Happy Hour is legit. 1/2 priced appetizers rock. The calamari was just OK. The Greek fries, with an unexpected lemon sauce as opposed to tzatziki, were very good. The watermelon salad, with its tomatillos, balsamic, and feta was honestly the best salad I've ever had. These will cost you about $3-4 a pop, and with moderately priced beers, amount to a fantastic light supper I would never turn down.   The meh: While inexpensive, the entrees disappoint. My gyro wasn't so bad it was inedible, but so soggy and bland it's not something I'd expect from a place that's supposed to specialize in it. I found the meat to be mostly unseasoned as well as cooked incorrectly--like they just had it simmering in a broth before putting it in the pita. My sweetheart dining companion was unimpressed with her falafel. The finale was the baklava cheesecake, which at $8 a slice I expected to be out-of-this-world. It was so loaded with cinnamon that despite the honey and shredded phyllo, it didn't taste like baklava at all!   I am open to returning, because at the very least it's a 5/5 HH. I'll just need to try different entrees, and skip dessert. For now, I'll say it gets 3.5 from me, but I can't round up when the main attractions were so disappointing!"}
{"text":"Started out trying this place because of a Groupon.  Now this is my go to place.  The greek fries are AWESOME.  The chicken Souvlaki is delicious,  The Greek salad is fresh and delicious.  My daughter loves it too.    For her and I to eat, we average about $25.00 a meal.  Not bad at all!!"}
{"text":"Decent place at a decent price. Not a lot of options for people who only eat seafood, but what can I say, it's Greek!  Atmosphere was ok, not real cozy or quaint."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Tempe!! Such a fun atmosphere and food is amazing. Friday and Saturday nights they have live music too. Very fun!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest here, this is not a great gyro. The meat is under seasoned and improperly prepared. The meat should not be a hideous pale color. The pita was fine as was the hummus."}
{"text":"Went here once. I honestly did not enjoy my food and I do not plan on going here again. The service was great but the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I love Greek food and have been wanting to try this place out since it opened.   I finally went yesterday before dinner time. Walking I wasn't sure what to expect. Soon as I walked in I noticed it was a order up front kinda deal then find your own seat.  The sitting area was very clean and well organized. You know first impressions are important for a restaurant. I was kinda lost in the menus placed on the tv screens. A manager came over and handed me a menu to look over which was great, I didn't even think he noticed my friend and I walk in. Within a couple mins after the first manager handed over menus, another manager greeted us which was nice. You always want great interaction and excellent service as soon as you walk in the door.   I order the chicken plate off the grill. It came with you choice of two sides. I ordered the Greek salad and mixed veggies. The chicken was cooked to perfection drizzled with sauce on top and the mixed veggies takes the win over the Greek salad. Next time I go, I will double my veggies, seriously amazing! The price for two chicken plates, two drinks was priced too high for my late lunch wallet. Overall besides our over priced meal it was great customer service from the managers not the girl who was cashiering. She did come around to everyone's table to ask how it was going  & skipped our table and asked the table who literally just walked in the restaurant if they needed anything. Keep in mind they only had 3 tables there and us?!"}
{"text":"First time, i bought a groupon and took a friend for lunch. The food was Okay, nothing special, the pita bread is a flat bread while the middle eastern pita bread, is a pita with a pocket. Service was fast and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Cool venue, AMAZING food. Super friendly staff.  Greek fries, pita, and any salad.  You can't go wrong, did I mention gelato?!?!"}
{"text":"I love Gyros and this place has them and a whole lot more. Should you have a desire for taziki sauce and some lamb, this is the place. Gyros are only the beginning there's salads, meat dishes and more. Don't forget desert, as they have a decent selection to choose from. Opa Life is named appropriately."}
{"text":"We went there earlier this week with a Groupon coupon. We had Gyro sandwiches and wraps, fries and salad and all were beyond expectations. The fries were the best we've had in years. The Greek salad was really good ... I don't like cucumbers, but they were cut into such small pieces that I hardly noticed them.  Large portions of everything. Next time, we will order just one plate and share ... and there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"Food was great, though not cheap. But you get what you pay for. Plus the portions are pretty large, so we could have saved. Obey by splitting s couple dishes. We didn't have to wait long. Everything was pretty hot. And fresh. Service behind the counter was excellent, making recommendations and very personable. Follow-up service was very attentive too. We were full when we left with lots of extra pita for the numerous dips we took home with us. Hope this franchise comes to Ohio! Hard to find good Greek."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch and Opa satisfied me with amazing  food, an incredibly friendly staff with quick service in a comfy and clean environment. I ended up ordering the Chicken Pesto Pita with side salad and my friend had the gyro pita sandwich with salad. The pesto sauce is simply awesome! Very flavorful and not at all oily (I prefer a thicker pesto). The pita bread was fresh and soft and the chicken cooked perfectly. As for the side salad ... It was a meal in itself! So good and so fresh. Tons of cucumbers, tomatoes, feta and divine dressing! The gyro was just as tasty and their iced tea blends are delicious. All of this for under $10 each! We will definitely be back .... I am determined to try the club pita.... I hear it's to die for and big enough to feed two!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice for lunch, and both times the food was delicious.  The first time I had the chicken souvlaki on a skewer with warm pita on the side, rice, and seasoned, grilled veggies.    The second time I had the beef souvlaki as a pita sandwich that was filled with shredded lettuce, finely chopped tomato and cucumber, and  tzatziki sauce.  I chose the salad for my side this time, which was romaine lettuce, cucumbers, bell peppers, olives, and red onion with feta cheese and a Greek dressing.  It had the perfect amount of dressing and was so flavorful.    I don't know what \"souvlaki\" means, but the seasoning and flavor on both the chicken and beef were so good, I want to make it at home so I can have it all the time.  And both times, I liked that the meat was tender, and not dry. Their pitas are also so good- fluffy, tender, and served warm.    The pita sandwich was really full, and it was difficult to eat.  The owner suggested next time I could try the wrap, because it is easier to eat, since everything is more contained. I did notice a lot of people ordered wraps, but I love their pitas, so I don't know that I will want to switch to the wrap. The owner has been there both times I've had lunch and is really friendly, and helpful if you don't know what to order.  My friend, who has gone with me both times, absolutely loves their feta berry salad with the addition of grilled chicken. The salad has greens, berries, and candied walnuts, with feta cheese and strawberry dressing. She said it's her favorite salad and doesn't want to try anything different."}
{"text":"I had a healthy meal of chicken with lemon sauce on it and vegetables I brought my mom with me and she really enjoyed it too. The vegetables had cheese on it and chicken was tasty. Great meal"}
{"text":"Love this place.   I am on a diet and I can find healthy alternatives here.   I had great beef kabobs, forget their greek name,  veggies and salad with a bit of vinaigrette.   There's not a lot of places worth healthy options.   They're are a lot of other good alternatives too.   Plus they had music on Friday night when we were there.   It was an older jazz type band but it was good live music.   I recommend this place,  I've been there two times now.   I'll come again.  Plus they stay open late."}
{"text":"Stopped in to see if they had dolmades (stuffed grape leaves). They do and I can say they are the best I have had at any restaurant. Friendly staff and great open environment. I will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Opa Life. I was a fan of My Big Fat Greek Express, which was in the same place prior, so I've resisted for awhile. My first thought was, \"my, this is a little expensive for a place that is not full service.\" Total for three was about $52 with no appetizers and no booze, just soft drinks. But the taste was awesome and the portions were generous. I brought half of my Aegean Club home for my stepson. My wife had lamb souvlaki medium rare and said everything was wonderful. My son had chicken souvlaki and gobbled it up. Loved it."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and the name has changed to Pangea Grill. We ordered fish and chips and chicken wings. The chicken wings came out and were cold in the very center. I let Troy our waiter know. He went above and beyond making up for the mistake made in the kitchen. He brought out a double order of the chicken wings, an order of Greek fries and an order of calamari. The wings can out perfect the second time. They went above and beyond to make up for the mistake. Everything we had was delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Opa! I've always been a fan of gyros. They make tasty and hearty ones!  The fries are crispy and great, but the Greek fries are even better!   Although I'm not a huge fan of salad, the Greek salad that I had a few bites of is good.... if you like that sort of thing.   The baklava is excellent and works great as an appetizer or a dessert. Haha. But the Loukoumades are amazing!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh, they give you a salad with your Greek wrap and the food is very delicious!"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is awesome! I ordered a pita with veggies. Absolutely delicious! My grand daughter loved her Mac and cheese with Apple sauce and gelato. The restrauant is very clean and the music is pleasant-not so Loud you cannot visit. :)I even ordered a to go wrap for my hubbys lunch tomorrow. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was super tasty! The staff was super nice and the whole atmosphere of the restaurant was very chill. It's a smidge on the pricier side, but they do give you a LOT of food. The fries could have been a little better but it's my fault for not ordering the Greek variant. Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"love going here. love the gyro wrap with greek salad. always super fast service"}
{"text":"Tried to line up and order at 5:15pm on a Sunday. Told me to pretty much take a hike because they were closed. Mall closes at 6pm."}
{"text":"OPA Life Greek Cafe gives me life!  I arranged to meet up with a group of friends on a weekend evening here, not knowing ahead what fun we would have. If you call ahead of time and have at least 10 persons, you can set a reservation, otherwise you'll be at the mercy of whatever free tables are available upon arrival. Luckily they weren't too upset when my group of 10 shrank to 7 at the midnight hour, and we were able to grab 2 big tables next to another. You order from the counter and they bring it out, a very easy process. I was surprised at how quickly my meal came out! They have a big menu headboard above the order counter and handheld menus, with a lot options for breakfast, lunch, & dinner, as well as a full bar.  One of my friends lives nearby and loves coming here. Her go-to is a gyro, but this evening we decided to each go with a Gyro Platter, me with veggies and Greek Fries. Spend the $1 on the fry upgrade! The excess toppings were great with my gyro meat and veggies. Since I worked out right before, I joined the clean plate club. If I hadn't, I don't think I would've been able to- for all the food I ate, it was worth the price! If you have space in your stomach, order the fried ball dessert that comes with ice cream and honey- oh so amazing!!  During the weekends they typically have a live band play music in the corner, so it might a tight squeeze, especially if no one wants to sit outside. During our dinner it was a little loud at times, but we made due, thankfully we were close to the door & not to the band."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for lunch a nice saturday afternoon.  Sat on the patio, and we ordered a gyro wrap plate with salad, chicken and pork kabob plates.  The food was really fresh and good quality.  The meat kabobs were freshly grilled with a good char flavor!  The salads were refreshing and had a good amount dressing, not too heavy.  Appropriate prices and definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Loving Greek food as much as I do I returned to give this new venue a second shot.  While the environment is GREAT for working, free wifi music (80's Rock that day) and spacious, the food doesn't cut it.  I ordered a basic greek salad, my friend a gyros and we had a hummus appetizer.    The first hummus tasted spoiled, the kind when you put it in your mouth it fizzes.  I eat hummus almost daily and I'm hard to please but fresh is key.  They did replace it with no hassle but it didn't start things well.  For the high prices it was a lackluster salad,  lettuce unassuming, unripe tomatoes and dressing that tasted like it was from a bottle.  For the price I expected a much higher quality salad, not a cheap diner salad.  The gyros plate was just as unimpressive.  Second visit the staff was pretty and either brand new and didn't know anything or not well trained.  We got what we needed but service could overlook the high prices and so-so quality.    I'm vegan so I can't eat much else, but if you want a quick meal, a place to work it's good.  And they just opened so much of this may work out!!  I will have to be REALLY hungry to go again but would have a meeting here."}
{"text":"Super tender and tasty chicken kabobs.  The portions are surprisingly large.  I'll definitely come back. Might want to ask for sauce on the side ... they are quite generous."}
{"text":"If you want to have a quick meal without the hassle of table service but still want rather healthy menu options, this is an alright place to go. Compared to the other restaurants around (Johnny Rockets, Four Peaks Brewery, The Lighthouse Cafeteria...), this seemed like a healthy option. You order right at the counter, they give you a number and they bring your food to you. However, I came with 2 other people and they were served their food well before I received mine. They actually gave me the wrong number and couldn't find me. It wasn't until I went up to the counter to look for my food that I had learned of their mistake.   Also, I ordered the beef pita and the beef was raw! I didn't want to return it because my husband and friend were nearly finished with their meals by the time I received mine and we were kind of in a hurry to get back to the aquarium. The only real positive from this dining experience were the yummy crispy french fries that I stole from my husband's meal."}
{"text":"Literally the best Greek restaurant and food I have ever had. Its a nice quaint area with live music and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the greatest greek places i have ever gone to. Food was amazing and very well priced. The staff was really friendly too."}
{"text":"Decided to have gyros for lunch and was nearby so we stopped in. The gentleman working the counter was nice and helpful and explained everything to us. Ordered a gyro with fries and some calamari. The calamari didn't taste like anything. It wasn't overcooked or anything there was just no flavor. The fries that came with the gyro were pretty good but the gyro itself was disappointing to say the least. I ended up eating maybe half before tossing it. I have too many other places I love to go for gyros so I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was a very strange place. Greek restaurant but for some reason there's animatronic dinosaurs taking up two tables... like, why? We waited on line for a while, ordered and waited. And waited. And waited. Terrible service. Waited over 30 minutes for our food. It was good but I don't know if that was because I was just overly hungry at that point. Also, there were children who looked about 9 serving food to tables... Don't think that's legal. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Very nice place . Had a diner with my husband and mom. Food is very delicious. Big portions. Lots of varieties burgers, pitas wraps, pizzas. Owner is very friendly guy. The only minus was I was to full to try any of tasty looking deserts. Definitely will be back and recommend to all my friends. Big plus nice roomy place to sit outside."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The service was excellent and friendly. You order in the front and grab a table. They will deliver to you! My kabob was amazing and they have an appetizer that's a sampler with all kinds of deliciousness. We didnt have dessert because we were super full but wanted to try the cheesecake baklava!"}
{"text":"They had a guy on the corner advertising breakfast I love this place for lunch but was really disappointed when I walked in with only one person working and 4 people I. Line and several people waiting for food needless to say I turned around and left. If your trying to build business you should be staffed to do so"}
{"text":"I was very surprised at this place. Some of the establishments at Westgate offer premium prices, but less that premium offerings. Not so with Opa Life. I know it is a chain, but sheesh, the food is super tasty. The gyro plate is enormous and super tasty. The Greek fries have a wonderful lemon Dijon sauce that is just fantastic and pairs well with the feta cheese and herbs. This locations is awesome and the patio overlooks a lawn area. Just a well put together and well thought out establishment. Pair their food, with a cold beer and watch the crowds go by. Great way to spend part of an afternoon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in westgate. Good food, lovely outdoor patio seating area. If you like Greek food, you will like opa. Can't go wrong with some hummus and pita."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I actually detoured to this place to something different. I was pleasantly surprised that the place looked clean and modern considering some of the other places in the same area (not say to say that those are bad places).  I was instantly disappointed with the menu prices since I was expecting more of a $10 or less ala cart type meal since I am on a budget. i settled for the special they had listed for $9.95 with a picture, but then was disappointed that to get the pictured item I would have to pay a dollar more. The meal I got was a gyro, greek fries, and a drink. The presentation was above average and pleasant,and the food was good. The greek fries were very good and the gyro was pretty good as well. The food seemed very american with a greek flavor when I was looking to settle for the opposite (another disappointment). There were others around me who ordered dishes that look very delicious, but I am sure that that they cost of those meals was higher than mine as well. I would probably go back with reservation, but it wouldn't be my first choice. As we were leaving around 7pm on a Friday night, it appeared that a jazz quartet was setting up for entertainment."}
{"text":"Went there expecting nothing after a dismal experience at Kabuki Japanese Sushi and I can honestly say the food was great if not a little pricey. The owner was there and was pleasant to speak to. Not many places who serve Stella Artois use or even have the official Stella glass,but they do so that was a great bonus.  If you're looking for excellent Greek cuisine and a great selection of beers, look no further."}
{"text":"Staying at the Renaissance was looking for a quick but good lunch. Very nice establishment. Definitely Americanized Greek food but the food is very high quality and healthy. If you're walking around Westgate and thinking about going to one of the chains, simply because you're familiar with them and dont know where else to go, go to Opa's, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely everything sucked. From the service to the soda. It was all a mediocre experience. We used our $5 discount from going to the Odysea Aquarium. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME.  We waited for 10 minutes and asked for a server several times before someone from the kitchen took our order. The calamari had zero flavor and was swimming in oil. They ran out of chicken nuggets? The kids hamburgers were dry and inedible. We had to ask for plates, napkins and refills.  I will be amazed if this place is still open in 6 months. Just typing this makes me feel nauseous. Ew, Ew, Ew! GROSS!!"}
{"text":"We went here with a Groupon and will be back for sure. The food was great! I really enjoyed the Greek fries...a real treat. The staff was very friendly and attentive. This is a great place to go before a movie for a good reasonably priced meal. I had the gyro with Greek fries which was delicious. The salads looked very good and I for sure will be back to try them."}
{"text":"Omg it was SO GOOD They have this California gyro with a generous amount of juicy grilled chicken, avacado mayo, with cheese and bacon and idk how Greek places make thier fries so light and crunchy and amazing, but I love it.  I tried it for the first time two days ago and I'm coming again today. Also their iced tea is fab, especially the mango one. The area it's in an adorable little shopping area as well  10/10"}
{"text":"Came early before the cardinals game. Whooooo. Go team. Anyways. We wanted some small and healthy. So we saw this place. its new at westgate, why not try it. We sat on the patio. It was so nice out. I ordered the hummus. Ohhh man..the hummus though!!! I got the three hummus appetizer, Tomato garlic, cilantro and spicy. Dipped with cucumbers instead of the pita bread. It was wonderful. My friend ordered a steak gyro with fries on the side, He enjoyed his meal.  The service was wonderful. Great staff."}
{"text":"I'm at Westgate pretty often, as I'm a season ticket holder with the Coyotes.  So the wife (M) and I spend a pretty decent amount of time eating and having cocktails at the numerous bars and restaurants there.  I can't honestly tell you what took us so long to try this place. We just continued to walk by in search of other options. This time, we decided to stop in and give it a shot.   The food here is amazing.   I ordered the Greek omelette. I don't remember what M ordered, mostly because I blocked out the outside world entirely while I enjoyed the Greek omelette.  The place could have been on fire and I would have never known.  And even if I did, I would have taken that omelette with me and finished it. The vegetables were perfect. The gyro meat was perfect.   Will absolutely go back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a solid option for dining at Westgate. When I worked in the area, I came here for lunch at least once a week for almost two years. Very good, freshly prepared food and very friendly staff. The owner is a great guy who once comped my whole meal because of the wait.   Which brings me to the only real negative about this place, the wait. Most of the time food comes out in a timely matter, but it can get very busy and the kitchen tends to get backed up. I came back today for the first time in months and had no issues at all. However, it was 4:00 pm on a Sunday and relatively slow. If you come here during a game or other big event, you should allow extra time to be served. Other than that, it's a good place and I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times so we are still working through the menu :-) Breakfast, lunch, and dinner is served...bonus points for serving beer too...  The service is great.  The staff is top notch and friendly. You will want for nothing!  The food is good and I think they're still fine tuning (a little heavy on the cinnamon in the baklava, but the Loukamades were great!). Given sometime, it's going to be a great neighborhood and happy hour joint!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Between their friendly service, rewards program (SpotOn), great music, and tasty fare, this place is great spot for a date night or group hangout.   Food: Greek fare is super tasty. The pizzas are delicious, and the platters are flavourful and filling. There's a variety of wine and beer. The meats can be slightly dry at times, but it's still good.   The best item by far is the baklava cheesecake. Do you like baklava? Honey? Walnuts? Cheesecake? Magic dust? (cinnamon?) If so, get this. It is incredible. Bring a friend or two to share though, because this dense culinary delight is sure to leave you full.   Atmosphere: how cool is live music and dancing? I haven't figured out their schedule for music yet, but you're sure to hear some rocking beats on weekend nights and certain weekdays. Jazz and Latin beats can be heard throughout the night.   Service: you order at the front and they bring it to where you're seating. Be prepared to get there early if you want a table inside."}
{"text":"First time at Opa Life on the recommendation of a friend. What a great find! Casual, friendly, lots of options on the menu. I had lamb souvlaki with Greek salad and rice. Outstanding! Everything was flavorful and fresh. Seasoning right on point, and generous servings. This is definitely a place I will return to over and over."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything I had to include the cheese cake was incredible. Greek fries are a must have."}
{"text":"I love gyros- but the one i received here was the worst one ever.  Very little meat or sauce, but lots of lettuce sprinkled with paprika.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place after a coworker gave the recommendation during lunch. Had my order of gyro wrap with salad to go. Upon my arrival, I was greeted with friendly service and the place had a casual vibe and was kept clean. The food???... Deeeeelicious!! Plus they had military discount! Found my new fave west valley Greek restaurant alongside Dino's!"}
{"text":"My family came here after visiting Odysea Sea Aquarium and wanted to grab some lunch I'm so happy we stopped here the food was Delicious !!!! I will be coming back even if I don't visit the Aquarium which we are pass holders so I'm sure I see myself coming  a lot it was that good :) it helps to that the kids got to eat free not sure how Long that will last but I sure hope it does. I ordered the California wrap and it was moist and flavored to perfection my husband ordered the basic gyro and the meat was tender and delicious the fries were so good !!! My kids enjoyed cheese pizza they had a great selection for kids menu which is. I've to see because we all know how picky toddlers / kids are they had spaghetti , chicken , pizza , and other options as well as a nice selection of beverages for adults and children some great IPA'S on draft and a nice cocktail list the avocado chipotle May was very good as well I look forward to commune back ;) don't forget to check in and get 15% off your tab."}
{"text":"This place by far is the best gyro place I have ever eaten!!! Amazing food best Greek fries I have ever had ! I got the pita gyro and a Greek salad ! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. We went to the dinosaur place below and then to this restaurant and it was worth it. We ordered the shrimp and lamb and they both were amazing. This is definitely not fast food. Way better than fast food."}
{"text":"Sitting here on a Friday night with friends having some good food, listening to a great local band (Divided Minds), having a great time, then Hank walked in.  He was walking from table to table and farting then he would yell \"Opa!\" and walk away.  I recommend Opa Life!  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Very busy as it was a game night for the coyotes, but we got our food pretty quickly.  Had the gyro, delicious!  Their fries are great too.  The do need more seating."}
{"text":"A nice surprise after a day at Odysea!  Who'd a thunk a fresh, yummy lunch was here in the food arena. We enjoyed the Chicken Shawarma Pita and the Chicken was tender and perfectly cooked to order. Crispy fries!"}
{"text":"There are many options for a quick dinner before an event at the arena, but I would definitely go here again. My hubby had pork skewer plate and I went out on a limb and tried the goat. It's easy to screw up goat and get dry meat without flavor, but we were pleasantly surprised. It was \"medium\" just like I ordered, juicy and tender. This would be good goat anywhere! A well-earned 4 stars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here three times now and we ordered different items each time. Greek Omelette is very tasty and not overpowering with the gyro meat or feta cheese with fruit, the fruit cup was a good size for a cup. Western omelette had plenty of peppers, onions and bacon with a side of salsa, hash browns were crunchy. We have both had different versions of the breakfast panini sandwiches and likes them both. I have also had a gyro and that was by far the best flavored gyro meat I have had. This is a definite go back."}
{"text":"Great food great service. We all enjoyed it and when it comes to Greek food who knows it better then someone who has lived in Greece many years"}
{"text":"Found Opa on yelp and decided to try it. One of my buddies is Greek and he said it was worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Warm pita, jalapeño/cilantro hummus  and chicken souvlaki with rice and salad."}
{"text":"Huge portions, authentic taste and a very friend staff. The price was on point and food came out at a perfect pace and oh yea, they do a ton of live music here also"}
{"text":"Allan is the best and the service has gotten better since my original review! Thanks so much!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my Family had the pleasure of eating at this restaurant. It was our first time and we all enjoyed the food, Service, and atmosphere.   A very friendly gentleman by the name of Allen came to our table and introduced himself. He went through the menu and let us know what he recommended. I thought that was very nice of him.  Throughout our meal he came cover multiple times and made sure everything was ok and the food was to our liking..  Overall we received great customer service and I recommend the hummus bar with pita chips, Greek fries (delicious),Chicken Caesar wrap was so good, Lamb Souvlaki, Greek salad.... I could go on... You will not be disappointed..  We will be back."}
{"text":"This Restaurant is the number 1 go to restaurant we go to with out of tow guests! The food is always flavorful, warm and fresh ! The cappuccino is perfect. Just the right amount of foam, plenty of flavor. Our guests rave about the food and we usually end up there before their flight leaves. I go there often with friends on a regular basis. Best Greek food around. Alan the manager is always friendly and attentive (he makes the best cappuccino and lattes) The rest of the staff is just as nice. I love the open air feel of the restaurant, heaters available for the patio when needed, and misters to keep you comfortable in the summer. A must try desert is the Baklava Cheesecake. It's big so you can share or take it home to enjoy later. If you love souvlaki the chicken is tender and well seasoned. Chicken use to be my favorite. My husband was gracious enough to share a bite of the beef. WOW melt in your mouth tasty beef, my new fave."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Food is fresh and so yummy always! The staff here at Opa life @ Westgate are always welcoming and friendly. Live music on weekends, great for all the family."}
{"text":"So yummy! My mom LOVED her meal and kept talking about it for days after. I got the pizza salad and it was really good, but all the toppings fell off when I tried to eat it like a pizza and I was left with a super hard, crunchy crust. I ate it like a salad, then just ate some of the crust after, but it was just too crunchy for me. The workers were nice, but one of them was a little too nice to me and kept interrupting us while we were talking and eating. They also had rap music blaring on the speakers when we were just sitting outside trying to enjoy our meal by the fire they have outside - that kind of ruined the ambience, but other than that, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and the price is pretty spot on for Greek food. We had the chicken souvlaki and the lemon sauce was really delicious. The only drawback is they open the doors to the patio and outside and we've had 4 or 5 flies buzzing around us and it's 102° outside. Close the doors and let the cool air stay in guys."}
{"text":"Our first time here today 3/5/16 and I called in the order so I could arrive and have our lunch prepared. I picked up food for my son who is 6 and not into Greek food. We have now been waiting 40 minutes from the time I called for a chicken salad and Euro not even meals!!!!! Hahaha what a joke never coming back!!!!! Girls didn't even say sorry for the wait!! Now my son has to eat cold food!!!! THANK YOU OPA!!!! LAME!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Greek Fries. Super good food & customer service was terrific. Loved it. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service, great value and really fresh and great food!   I will certainly come back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Greek Frys are ssssooooo amazing! They were perfectly crispy and soft in the center! The Sauce on top of them was tangy and the feta was very fresh! I'll be back to try everything on the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"So I tried this place for the first time. The flavors were pretty good. Had an American flavor to it as to be expected being in America. I had the gyro with Greek fries. Greek fries are a dollar up charge and well worth it. Dressing and cheese on top. My wife had the Greek chicken salad and loved the flavor profile. To wash the pallet down I had a canoli. Not too sweet but just right with the chocolate drizzle and whip. I will be returning."}
{"text":"We stopped after a movie for dinner. Loved the food. We sat on the patio, GREAT atmosphere. Live music was playing in the courtyard. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place! Love the Greek fries! Great service always. It's a regular stop for us. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good spot for a gyro! I had the gyro wrap with salad and it was pretty damn good. Nice location nestled is Westgate Entertainment District with some great people watching. Perfect place for lunch and good for a quick dinner if your in a hurry to grab a drink at the many bars in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!!! I'm visiting from Southern California and I wish there was one by my house. This place could easily compete with Daphne's and OPA Life has a way batter menu!"}
{"text":"Had the gyro and fries. They gyro was very good, overflowing the pita with meat. The veggies were fresh, the sauce tangy. Good sandwich. The fries were good, just not my style -- those battered fries. Coke machine was a bit foamy. Napkins are scarce -- kept at bar/soda machine, not tables.  Lot's of TVs and good beer on tap. The place has a good vibe.   The staff was really friendly, not too talkative, and quick. Awesome (unlike Hertz for sure).  I'll be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is to plan for extra time if you're gonna eat here.  The best word to describe them is slow.  Due to that, I can hardly remember what the food actually was like."}
{"text":"My bf and I have been wanting to try this place since we moved here and finally did and definitely was not disappointed! The food was so fresh and flavorful, the grilled chicken was cooked perfectly. Not to mention the customer service was amazing as well. We're looking forward to our next visit!"}
