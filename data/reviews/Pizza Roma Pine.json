{"text":"Best Pizza in Pine Twp. Worth the drive if you are out of delivery range. No conveyor here with GREAT crust."}
{"text":"This pizza place has fast and friendly service, great food, wide variety of food. Service was nice, kind, quick, and great and easy to find location. We got a Sicilian 16 cut and it was so good that we (3) ate the whole thing! They have soda in 2 liter bottles which were inexpensive at very cold. I give this place 5 stars!! If you need pizza in under 20 minutes that doesn't taste like wet cardboard, this is the stuff!!!!"}
{"text":"I live 2 miles from this location and it takes over an hour to receive my food. 50% of the time the order is wrong and/or cold."}
{"text":"Ok. I ordered a med pie xtra cheese and sausage. All that went through my mind was where's the sausage? $25 for a med pie and order of wings. Pizza wasn't real good either. Dough or flour has changed. Guys were nice service was fast. That's why I gave 3 stars. Food 1.5 stars, at best."}
{"text":"I will never spend another dime here. I just looked at my reciept, I was charged a $1.50 delivery charge. I always tip my driver very generously. Shame on you greedy people, your food is mediocre at best and now you charge extra. Goodbye, I can buy a sub par pizza anywhere."}
{"text":"I can't get my fianc√© to eat pizza anywhere without comparing it to Pizza Roma. This will always be his favorite. I enjoy Pizza Roma in Gibsona, but I don't have the same high pizza standards he does!"}
