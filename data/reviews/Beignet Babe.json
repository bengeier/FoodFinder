{"text":"So incredible and fresh.  Very easy ordering with quick replies. Personable and proffessional.  If you haven't had one (or can't pronounce) like me just order and you won't be sorry.  Try with dime coffee or tea...yum!"}
{"text":"Found this gem at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival. They had 3 different beignets that they were sampling and all were absolutely delicious!! I typically never eat peaches or maple but my husband convinced me to try the Maple Bourbon Peach Beignet and it was super yummy. They also had a Cubano beignet that was stuffed with  braised pork which was absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"So I tried Beignet Babe after purchasing a Groupon for a dozen beignets. I've never had a beignet, so I was excited to try them. I was expecting it to be similar to a sopapilla, but it's so much better than that!! I contacted the owner on Monday thru Facebook seeing when I could pick up the order since it is NOT a store front. (As stated kn Groupon to contact ahead of time) She let me know her availability, and was quick and courteous to respond. Come Thursday, I went to the location which is a shared kitchen of other local up and coming food vendors. The idea of this is so cool!! I had never seen of anything like that and really gives those just starting out a chance. So I paid and and my order was ready & that was that. But the tasting!! OMG! Hot and fresh. You can tell it was just made. I got a variety- traditional, lemon filled, Nutella filled and DULCE de leche filled. My fave was the DULCE de leche. But all so good, and FILLED to the max with filling. It was oozing out. Had a great experience over all and will definitely order again in the future"}
{"text":"I had a groupon to use for the beignets. They were delicious. They have to be eaten the same day so I had to invite my daughter and grandson for dinner to treat them.  A neighbor friend came to visit and I gave her 5 to take home. Within 3 minutes of her leaving my house, she texted me how delicious they were and she wants to order some. I only had 2 different kinds but now that I know they make so many flavors, I will have to order some more."}
{"text":"Had them last week at the market.   Tonight went back to get a order and sold out at 730pm   That is like McDonald's running out of fries"}
{"text":"I am a beignet snob on a lookout for hidden local gems and would say that i am truly impressed with how fresh and good these taste. Melts in your mouth! I ordered a dozen of mixed flavors to go and my favorite was the Nutella filled beignet. It is slightly on the expensive side but I understand as it is not massed produced, orders needed to be placed in advance for pickups. Knocked off a star because of the additional effort needed to call and place orders/work out time for pickup for beignets (though I heard they are available in farmer markets if you prefer a hassle free experience). otherwise, best tasting beignet I have ever had (do I dare say better than cafe du monde in New Orleans? That would be a resounding YES!!)"}
{"text":"I was one of the judges at Scottsdale culinary festival this year and omg the ham and cheese beignet is amazing. Definitely stopping in to grab a few!"}
