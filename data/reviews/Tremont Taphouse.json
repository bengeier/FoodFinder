{"text":"The food was AMAZING! I got the steak \"hand-held\" with a homemade bleu cheese sauce. It was unbelievable and the beer selection was great. If you get Mac and cheese and like heat, try adding just a touch of siracha sauce, two-thumbs up. The plates were moderately priced but a little steep if you were expecting pub prices, $14 for my sandwich. Good for me though I had bet my friend before we went in about the quality of food and I WON!! the food was great, wish I had a local bar like that in my neighborhood"}
{"text":"I don't drink beer, so I just get water. It's pretty great water. All my friends tell me the beer selections is even better than my water.

I love their food! Burgers, chorizo tacos, pork belly nachos! MMMMMMMMM!!!

The patio is relaxing, inside not so much."}
{"text":"Came here while in town from michigan for a family event. The beer list is awesome the food is amazing you should come here now... On second thought don't I don't want a line out the door next time!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great for watching a game, but not a sports bar. Excellent beer selection - not the largest I've seen, but definitely a large selection of beers, and (this is critical) the beer menu is well laid-out and easy to understand. And they list ABV! Bonus points. The food is top-notch as well - the mussels are awesome, mac & cheese to die for, and the burgers and sandwiches are consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is consistent and always amazing.  Service can sometimes be a little slow, but all in all, great place."}
{"text":"The Tap House is now in the running for my favorite place to dine in Cleveland!  It's places like this that make me wish I lived on the west side, for sure.  The evening didn't exactly start out smoothly as we had to wait a good half hour after our call-ahead 'reservation' was supposed to be, but it was a Saturday night and I think my hunger and having to watch other people's food come out is what made it seem so much longer than that.  Props to the staff, though, for being pleasant and communicative throughout.

   When we finally were seated, we decided to get a couple different plates to share.  The calamari was excellent and I love it when cherry peppers are involved.  I've never been too into pierogis, but my brother-in-law got them and they were so freaking good!  The brussels sprouts are swimming in butter that helps the sprouts practically melt in your mouth.  Sister-in-law got what I think was a special that evening, the fish taco.  The pico and fish were very fresh, but I didn't much care for the wasabi aioli (?) they slathered on it.  My wife got the wild mushroom pizza with truffle oil, which I believe to be the magic ingredient to make anything delicious.  Rounding things out, I had what is my favorite burger yet in Cleveland, their blue cheese & bacon edition.  Also, having 'tap house' in the name their beer selection is, of course, monstrous.  If I actually cared for beer I'd no doubt be coming here on a weekly basis if not more frequently.

  I really have no excuse for not heading west more often, and Tremont Tap House is going to make it harder to put off doing so."}
{"text":"Quality of food is always top notch, creative menu,  ingredients are  fresh and quality, service is always friendly and helpful. I just wish I liked beer."}
{"text":"The Tremont Tap House never, ever fails.  I've been here around two dozen times and have yet to leave disappointed. The food is amazing, which includes the best burger I've ever had -- the green chile burger. The beer list is extensive and ever-changing. If you can't decide for yourself, the bartenders always offer great beer recommendations based on your particular taste/mood. 

In addition to a great dinner menu, and just when I thought this place couldn't get any better, they introduced a Sunday brunch. Lucky us. Totally hits the spot in terms of \"hangover food.\" 

I would ask that patrons keep in mind that if you show up at 7pm on a Friday night plan on grabbing a few drinks at the bar because you will be waiting for a LONG time. 

Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"Outstanding (top?) beer selection. great location, usually great service (exception was some girl we had on the patio who was an absolute nightmare but everyone else is fine.) Kinda overpriced but it is a great place to go nontheless."}
{"text":"My favorite place in cleveland.  I have been coming here once or twice a month for a couple years now and still love the menu.  The chorizo pizza is great and they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Recipe for a relaxing Friday night in Cleveland:

Go to Tremont Tap House when the weather is nice, plan to wait a little while, and sit on the patio. 

Ahh, relaxation. Have a really good beer from their long micro list. Think about the mac & cheese, perhaps have a happy-hour fling with the half-priced apps, and settle in for a lovely evening. Have another good beer or two, and eat something amazing. You're welcome."}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite restaurant. I have yet to have a bad experience here and I've been going back for 3+ years. I enjoy that the menu changes every few months so I can try variations of my favorite dishes.

The calamari might just be the best thing on the menu and there are always a huge variety of beers to pick from. I also like the atmosphere. While downstairs is more of a bar atmosphere, upstairs provides the perfect setting for groups. 

I highly suggest doing a call ahead before going to the restaurant. There is not a lot of standing room and it can get crowded.

Excellent spot to go try in Tremont when you are looking for classic bar menu with a twist."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of beer, food was exactly what I was hoping for delicious takes on traditional favorites."}
{"text":"We got burgers here and they were amazing. We love burgers, and this makes our top five list for sure. the only negative I had was that the service was a little weird, the waitress wasn't the most personable. Service went at a fine pace, just weird personalities. Other than that everything was awesome- and love that they are pet friendly!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken, my brother had the steak, my sister-in-law had the pork chop and my husband had the burger and we all cleaned.......i mean we cleaned em good, clean-plate-club, cleaned our plates.  It was so yummy!!!!! and the service was superb!!  I have to say that one of my biggest pet peeves is when restaurants do not put salt and pepper on the table.  I feel that I usually need to add a touch of salt to things at many places these days, but everything was PERFECTLY seasoned and they had s&p on the table anyway.  It was very loud in there and maybe the crowd was kinda young, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place has such a great energy, I've been here numerous times. Off the bat, they had my favorite IPA on draft, Rogue Farms 7 Hop IPA (for whatever reason I have a hard time finding this beer). Its the most difficult to not only find on draft but in bottles at the store. I also appreciate great food. The mushroom pizza is great to split with a date or friends and then indulge in a burger or turkey club with fries! The menu is excellent, along with the service. A definite 5 star location. I cannot stress how good the turkey club was, melted in my mouth the way I remember a Frisco Melt at steak in shake in High School."}
{"text":"I am smitten with the Tap House. The focus is on the bar, where they have dozens of beers on tap. I like beer but it's the food that had me at hello: it's delicious gourmet-pub sort of fare: the burgers are divine but so are their salads, grilled cheese and roast chicken. They also have a lovely patio and staff is cool.

What really won me over, however, was Sunday brunch. Un. Be. Live. Able. Crab benedict? Amazing. Oysters on the 1/2 shell? Fantastic. Chorizo and cheddar omelet? OMG yes. Potato hash? Perfection in spud form.

Sometimes the crowd is more hipsterfied than not but that's Tremont, I suppose. Some tips: They don't take reservations but you can call ahead to put your name in. Do not come here hoping for a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal here. Brunch is awesome! Their lamb burger is delicious. Good selection of drinks and service has always been pretty good."}
{"text":"Guess who just got a yelp account and is making up for lost time?!  This girl!

I f*cking love Taphouse.  I cannot put this any clearer.  If I could make sweet, sweet narwhal love to Taphouse (and Christian) I would.  Brunch? Yes, please. Chunky, spicy Bloody Mary and the chorizo burrito.  Done.  Do not even attempt to order anything else, it will pale in comparison.  I always go late to avoid the tourists but my god it is worth the starvation.  Beer? Do they have beer?!  It's in the name. Don't go there expecting quantity rather it's the quality.  Rouge Hazelnut. Rouge f'ing Hazelnut.  And they put kegs on nitro. NITRO!  This is the place to pop your domestic bottled cherry on some \"nice cans\"!"}
{"text":"The original gastropub in Cleveland still does it better than everyone else who has followed in their footsteps. Be sure to get there early if you want a seat at the bar, there aren't many other pubs that fill up as quickly. The exhaustive beer selection has something for everyone, and is one of my favorite places to go to try different beers I wouldn't ever come across otherwise. 

Even though it is easy to feel saturated with restaurants serving up burgers, these also stand out."}
{"text":"Grat place with awesome food ! Been going there for take out and dine in for over a year now, and never been disappointed ! 

The Joshua burger with duck fries is to die for ! The staff is friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"I stopped in The Tremont Taphouse for a drink with a friend who likes beer. This is probably a good place for beer drinkers for others not so much. There is an art to making a proper cocktail and the bartender did not have the patience or desire for it. He did not listen to what I ordered and then I was startled that he asked how it was - of course he breezed by without listening to my response so maybe his hearing is his real problem."}
{"text":"Let's see, I've had the chorizo tacos, mushrooms pizza, Mac N Cheese, turkey club, gnochi, apple fennel salad, house salad, blue cheese burger, house burger, mussels and they all  were fantastic. They is a gastro pub you must try! The service was exceptional. I sat at the bar a I did have a server, I had four. Every bartender helped me and asked me how was everything. Very friendly! This is my knew fav in Cleveland! I do want to see to dessert options. They obviously have the talent in the kitchen to make this happen. 

Deserts!"}
{"text":"This place is just Wow... If you're looking for the best burger in Cleveland, please come here. I've been here a lot and can never get past ordering a burger. It really is that good. It  makes a bspot burger taste like crap. Every time I've been here it's been packed and I've had to wait 30-45 mins to be seated... Was it worth it? For the burger it was. Also, they have the biggest beer list in Cleveland.... Oh yea, did I mention that their burgers are amazing?  
 
Some nights they also play movies on the patio. The last time there the movie was \"who framed roger rabbit\" who wouldn't want to come to a place that would play a classic like that :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Cleveland! 

Always has an amazing beer selection on tap.  My boyfriend is a big fan of the beer cocktails that they have as well.

The food is incredible.  I have never had anything bad off of the menu.  The mussels are a must for an appetizer.  They have great burgers, the turkey club and salmon blt are delicious.  The taphouse philly is also delicious.  The mac and cheese is also really good.  Honestly, you can't go wrong. 

They also have a nice outdoor patio that is connected to the bar so you can order drinks outside!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently early on a Friday evening. Our only complaint was that once they seated us, it took a while for a server or anyone to stop by, give us menus, etc, so we felt a little forgotten at first. Once someone came though, she was very attentive. Burgers and drinks were great and it's definitely a place to bring someone who hasn't been around Cleveland much - it just has that cool but not pretentious vibe!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Servers are very knowledgeable about the beer and food.  Is a great place to hang out with friends, enjoy and great beer paired with delicious food.  Definitely worth the drive from Cleveland Heights!."}
{"text":"This would be zero stars if possible. Went on a Friday to celebrate my 25th birthday on Thursday, and they would not serve me because my ID was 1 day expired. When I asked why, they responded that \"it could be my twins ID\". FYI.. Twins would be the same age -- both 25. On top of this, slow atmosphere and an obviously dying bar... Will be surprised if they make it til 2017."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this place has been somewhere I have wanted to eat for at least two years. I have heard that the Moule Frites (Mussels and French fries) were the best.  So my excitement soon turned to disappointment when my order came out with mussels and no fries. How is this possible? The ingredients of the dish is in the name.  Told my waitress about the issue and I did not see her again.  I am actually writing this review while I am waiting on my waitress.  Another waitress just came to my table to ask if there was an issue. My wife was able to finish her meal in the time it took for someone to comeback to my table.  I am super disappointed in the service, I will not be returning. Would give zero stars if it were possible."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Love the trendy atmosphere but also a good place to watch a game."}
{"text":"BEER!!!! They always have a great selection and the staff rocks. Bring back the BBQ chicken tacos please!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit here. The service was great, the food was delicious (not your typical bar food), and my husband loved the beer selection. We will definitely return; I especially look forward to hanging out on the patio in the spring!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, drink and hang out. Awesome selection of beers and outstanding food as well. Went for brunch a few times and it is always excellent. Servers are super friendly too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for dinner on Saturday night and sat out on the patio to enjoy the weather. We started with the calamari and I had the Joshua burger while my gf went with the mac and cheese. Everything was fantastic. Couldn't have been happier with the food. The beer selection is just as impressive.

I have to make a special note on how wonderful the general manager Christian was. They were way understaffed but Christian made sure to stop by from time to time to check in on us. When Christian noticed that my burger did not have the fried egg I had ordered he gave us a discount for a round of beers - this is where we ran into the nights only hiccup. My gf had a groupon for $30 off our meal and said that the computer was not able to register two discounts so she flat out told us that we couldn't have Christian's discount. Instead of taking the time to figure out how to handle the situation - which could have been rectified by simply removing two beers from our tab - she blew us off because she didn't want to spend the time. We didn't argue with her, but the more I think about it, I find it really annoying and frustrating how unaccommodating our server was in that moment. Oh well, Christian, the food and drink saved the night."}
{"text":"Love the tap house! Good menu selection for a bar. The burgers are really good. Great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Here for a birthday party but the service was great and all of the food we tried was really good! We also really liked the drink selection....lots of fun beers to choose from!
The area surround it is not so nice----but other than that, we would go back!"}
{"text":"Just heard about this place and decided to try it.  Joe was our server and was very helpful with beer selections, guiding us to something that suited our palates. We had the pork belly nachos as an appetizer, and it was fantastic. Definitely request extra chips, and sriracha sauce, you'll need them. We had the loaded Joshua burger, chorizo Mac & cheese, and Q's Banh Mi. The burger was phenomenal and we all enjoyed it. The Brussels sprouts were great as well. The Mac and cheese was very good and hearty, even though I was a little skeptical of the chorizo option.  The banh mi had a unique flavor with a light and refreshing flavor combination."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to come for some brews with good friends. The patio is a great place to be when the weather complies. Awesome place to relax and blow off some steam from the work week!"}
{"text":"I've visited the Taphouse many times and have never been disappointed. They always have a varying range of beer choices from more unusual and rare to more approachable styles. The food is always really good, and I particularly like the brunch.

If there's one bit of advice I can give you, please get the pancakes. These are honestly the best pancakes I've ever had. If you like pancakes at all, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here for brunch and for happy hours during the week. Great selection of beers on tap, good service and a nice patio. Get a spot in the booths or the bar if you can."}
{"text":"One of my go-to's . Really good beer selection and they make slight changes to the menu to keep it interesting. Probably have been there a dozen times and never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Meep! I love this place. Firstly, they have a parking lot! Hurray! It's small, but thank heavens its there. Secondly, amazing beer selection. I often select where to eat my food by where to drink my drinks and a great craft brew selection is always a big winner in my book. There's something for everyone, ranging from the pansy cider drinkers to the meaty double-IPA lovers. For non beer-drinkers, there is also a full bar! The bartop is a chalkboard, which makes for fun drunk-chalk drawing. 
The seating inside is limited but there are a few tables in the back that are large enough for a group. 
The patio seating is amazing, complete with a great fireplace. They project movies some nights! Awesome! 
The food: Brunch-amazing. I wanted to order everything. I ended up with the breakfast burrito. No regrets. Non-Brunch: amazing. Their burgers are fantastic. I would say don't go in a super large group because that backs up the kitchen and I wouldn't want anything to get in the way of you and a perfect burger. So go there, in a small select group a reasonably judgmental palates and prepare to wine and dine yourselves into bliss."}
{"text":"Service was great (Thanks, Joe - our server). Food was tasty. Best part was that our mussels came out a little cold. When we told him, there was no questions and he got us a replacement ASAP. Nice to know that when mistakes happen, then they do what is needed to make it right. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had my birthday party there and I was the best dining experience. The manager Christian is amazing. The food was excellent and they could charge more if they wanted to. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"A great summer place to hang om the patio and have some beers. Food is very good and prices arent to bad.  Been here twice now and liked it both times.  Interesting beers on tap and a menu that fits all tastes."}
{"text":"Gastro-pub indeed! This place has a crazy selection of beers on tap and in the bottle. The food is awesome. Some of my fave's are: grilled cheese, (built with both fontina and cheddar and complimented with roasted red peppers and watercress), goat cheese salad, i heart moule frites-( how can one go wrong with mussels served up with fresh cut fries simmering in a garlic beer broth?? usually served with blue cheese and bacon as well, but can made without)  
The atmosphere is cozy and usually packed around dinner time. The interior is dark wood and brick with chalk-board menus hovering over the taps. Half of the bar is lined with booths (with tables decorated by local artists) and bar-height tables. 
I love this place, I cannot tell a lie. I do miss the salmon add-ons for the salads but I will take the grilled cheese instead!"}
{"text":"Love the beer selection and I think the food is generally really good. They have good happy hour prices and I think that the staff is knowledgeable. I have sat at the bar a few times to eat and think the bartender is funny and friendly. 

Not so sure why there have been complaints about the BAR tv's playing sports, What else would you expect them to play. It's a bar not a movie theater."}
{"text":"I've never tried their food but they have an awesome beer selection on tap! The atmosphere is always up beat and their bartenders are very friendly! Their patio is dog friendly which I will definitely be bringing mine pup to this summer! The bar is slate so you can color on it with chalk, which was so fun!"}
{"text":"The Joshua Burger was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  The atmosphere and service were great!  There was an excellent selection of draft beers, and the beer sample option made allowed you to choose 4 to try!  Will go back when I visit Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now, and I'm only holding out of 5 stars because I haven't really eaten here yet.  I have tried the Calamari which is really good.  Some of the food prices seem a little high (12 dollars for a sandwich).

As others mentioned, the seating is limited, but I somehow haven't had a problem finding a seat yet.  There were quite a few people standing near tables the last time I was there.  

Service has been pretty good.  I waited a while when first seated on a Sunday, but other times it has been prompt.  It seems that the servers also pour their own drinks behind the bar.  This is probably more efficient but it leads to the server being gone longer.

A major plus for me is that they have Magner's cider here, which I really like.  A lot of places in Cleveland only have Angry Orchard or Original Sin which taste like sugared up apple juice.  

Their patio is large and seems like it would be nice in the warmer weather."}
{"text":"If you love an incredible selection of craft beers, then look no further.  The Tap House is the place to go.

There was a great atmosphere of a local pub, but it has the hidden jewels of great beers and well above-par bar type foods."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch  ugh so incredibly delicious!! My first time here, arrived about 10:15 am and starting to get pretty full on the first level by the bar. The upstairs in the kitchen that is open with a few bigger tables for larger parties. Bellied up to the bar for delicious mimosas, then moved on the the CLE cucumber cocktail. My friend and I split the breakfast burrito - filled with chorizo, egg, guacamole, peppers, pico and cheese and topped with a nice amount of hollandaise, sour cream drizzle and green onion. Served with cubed potatoes requested extra crispy!! We were both stuffed. Every plate coming my out from the kitchen made my mouth water. Nice and quaint with a lot of locals and good music. Will be back soon!! I have my eye on the breakfast pizza or hash for next time!"}
{"text":"Perfect day for sitting on the patio - a patio that is dog friendly.  Food is always good.  I am not a beer drinker, but i understand the beer selection is really good."}
{"text":"Was our first time here and won't be our last. To start the beer menu is excellent. Now onto the food. We had a party of three so we ordered some apps to share. The pork belly nachos were amazing. The pierogi app was also very good. Having had many pierogis in Cleveland these were in the top few. The sauce with them is excellent. For our meals we ordered the salmon blt, the green chile burger, and mussels. The salmon blt was excellent. The green chile burger was excellent. The mussels were good. The staff was very friendly and checked up on us to make sure every thing was good. The patio was very nice on this sunny Cleveland day. Overall we had a very good experience and the iced tea my wife ordered was amazing. It was so good we ordered two bottles to go. Can't wait to go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it here. Our party sat at the bar, which has the fun addition of a chalkboard to doodle on! The bartender who waited on us was really pleasant.
The calamari was amazing and the burger I got was pretty tasty! The beer selection is fantastic. The bar has a window that opens to the outside, creating a great atmosphere!
I left plenty full and feeling great."}
{"text":"So first off, there is call ahead system for getting a table. Apparently it's not a reservation but gets you ahead of us who just walk in. Maybe I had too many beers, but I couldn't quite follow the difference between call ahead and reservations. Next time I'll call ahead and see how that works out. That aside, the beer list is really solid and the food is tasty too. Try the pork belly carnitas, they are dope."}
{"text":"I must admit that I'm not a big beer drinker!  So I can't really comment on the beer selection.  But the food here is great.  Love the German pretzels.  Last time I was there I order the white pizza.  Not the best white pizza I've had, but still tasty!"}
{"text":"Love the beer selection   Milk Stout     etc.   , I had the turkey club with fries , It was the best club I've ever had in my life . This place was a total surprise to us , not your average bar food , beer selection was outstanding and service was fast ."}
{"text":"Effing delicious Tap House Philly Cheesesteak. I love that blue cheese whiz sandwich so much it made me write a review.

If you found this place by purchasing a Groupon, please don't come in here to insult the chef because your food doesn't taste like your local greasy spoon or insult the bartenders because your beer had a proper inch or more of head.

Just buy a groupon for TGI friday's and have a better night than you will at this place.

Ultimately I wrote this review because of the jerk who posted that their Bluecheese Philly cheesesteak was \"insult to the institution of philly cheesesteaks.\"

I lived in Philly for years and never had a better tasting steak sandwich that the one they serve here in Tremont. It's not meant to be served accross the street from Pat's or Geno's. It's tastes much, much more interesting than that.


P.S. The only complaint I can pass to the owner is that their beer menus don't get stamped regularly enough to tell you what taps are out. Last time I was there, the people at my table who couldn't see the board from their seat tried to order about 3 or 4 beers that were all out. That's not too big of an issue for people who know beer, but the ones that are beginning to be adventurous with it and take a long time to decide what to order get pretty discouraged when their selection is out."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients skillfully combined to produce distinct flavors and textures. Seriously, it's obvious that someone in the kitchen takes pride in their work. 
The 2 reasons I couldn't give 5 stars: they were out of several ingredients, narrowing my menu choices. However, we did pop in on a late Saturday night, so I wasn't too annoyed by the limitations. Secondly, they do not have a wine license, so your alcohol choices are limited to beer, regular bar cocktails, or a bottle of wine with a corkage fee ($25). 
Upon entering, we sat right away at the bar and were welcomed and served by all 3 bartenders, who were knowledgeable of the food and beer selection, and who made great recommendations for each. The atmosphere is has a somewhat hipster-tattooed graffiti vibe, but without the jaded snobbery that usually accompanies such decor. This is likely due to the sincerity of the servers/bartenders. The outdoor patio was wonderful at night, and it never got too crowded inside to eat comfortably at the bar. Plus, there's free parking!!!

Overall, great food and great service... Isn't that why we eat out?"}
{"text":"The only beer bar that will never serve you a pint. Never. Its 14oz and below, but good heavens you're definitely paying for privilege of sitting at their bar and drinking it. My friend who i went with put it the best, it's a 'dive bar' for rich people. The beer prices are completely outrageous and keep getting higher. I think the owner over expanded his credit line when renovating the place 4 years ago and his interest rate keeps going up, and he keeps renovating and adding on, and putting the cost into the menu. 

I'm sure I'm jaded from seeing the prices go up and up over the years, but really at this point if I would to recommend a 'gastro pub' it's definitely Deagan's instead. Its what this place used to be. Full pints, reasonable prices and great food. Only thing the taphouse has going for it is the patio,  i will admit it is a very very nice patio."}
{"text":"I'm visiting family and I called to make a reservation. I was told they do not take reservations, but they do call ahead seating. Then I was told that you have to do call ahead seating at least a day in advance, ideally a week in advance, but no guarantee and they'll try to get you in sometime around your recommended time. The guy on the phone was amazingly condescending and after rudely informing me of the above (which, seriously?) hung up on me. 

I ended up looking at my phone wondering what the hell just happened. Thanks, random Tap Room employee. In 30 seconds you managed to make me feel like shit and decide to never visit any establishment that would employ someone so utterly lacking in any and all social skills. Apparently Tap Room is doing so well that prospective customers are an inconvenience and a waste of their time."}
{"text":"Fled to Tremont Tap House after my teenagers balked at a different Cleveland restaurant that shall not be named. Thank goodness Tremont was open on a Sunday evening. Everything was great. From the friendly staff to the really nice patio where we enjoyed our meal. Asparagus salad, an amazing salmon BLT, and very good mussels. Terrific draft beer selection - I enjoyed the Ommegang Rare Vos. I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my husband, like another reviewer, go early, the place fills up fast. We got there at 8:30 and were told it'd be an hour wait unless we could get a seat at the bar. Like others have said, they have plenty of beers to try which is nice. 

I got the Free Range Chicken & Haluska and my husband got the Green Chili Burger. Mine was delicious. The portion was perfect, not small but not enormous. My husband like the burger and the fries that came with it were very good. 

The staff was very friendly. I've been here one other time and the service is always very good. Looking forward to returning again."}
{"text":"Cool place with a good vibe. Great beer selection and friendly staff. Two star review for the inedible fish tacos that we were served. They were the special for the night so we had high hopes. My guess would be that they got a bad batch of fish because they smelled/tasted awful."}
{"text":"This place has the best beer selection in Cleveland. They consistently have the most varied, interesting draft beers around. 

Their 4 beer lists - Belgian, Hoppy, House, and Featured vary in price from 4.5 a pint to $9 for 10 oz, depending on the beer's rarity. Their beer sampler ($10 for 4, 4oz samples) is a fun way to try several of the higher alcohol beers without breaking the bank (too much).

Food unfortunately is not nearly as varied or interesting as the beer. I've had pizzas and lamb burgers there, which are good, but never knocked my socks off.

Perhaps the worst thing about the Tap House is how poorly insulated it is. It's a cool old building with exposed brick inside, and an awesome patio for warmer weather but it's rather drafty during Cleveland's many months of chill."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 hangout places in Cleveland!  Never had a bad experience here.  Great atmosphere.  Music is never too loud like other bars.  Menu is small... but top tier as far as bar food goes in my opinion.  I've brought friends, parents, & dates here and everyone loved it too.  One of Cleveland's best bars as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Great service and ambience. Creative drinks and great small plates. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a bit pricier than I would have expected. 

Great food and drink! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I visited the Tremont Tap House for dinner while spending a couple days in Cleveland.  First impression:  kind of hard to spot from the street.  Not all that well-marked.  But after finding our way inside, we were not disappointed.  The beer list is excellent (and it better be when the name of your restaurant includes \"tap house\").  The list was dominated by IPA's and pale ales, but that's to be expected over the summer.  I was able to find plenty of darker options that were more to my liking.  We started our meal with some sort of meat and cheese plate, which wasn't bad.  I went with a burger for dinner.  Wow, definitely one of the best burgers I can remember.  Big, juicy, cooked perfectly.  The outside seating area is nice, and as we were preparing to leave, a movie was being shown on a large screen on the patio.  Not a bad option to have on a nice summer evening.  If you like beer and burgers (as everyone should), check out the Tremont Tap House."}
{"text":"In my last review I said \"I will definitely be back.\" Well I went back, about an hour ago, and I must say, the food let me down.

Friendly service and a wonderful beer selection as usual; I've got nothing bad to say about anything aside from my meal. I ordered the mac and cheese again with the confit chicken, but was given some dry chicken breast strips instead. This chicken tasted like chicken, but not much else, and I was expecting the same fall-off-the-bone chicken I received last time. My god, was that last-time chicken ever good! So it was a bit of a let down. And a fair portion of the mac had unmelted cheese still in it.

I don't like to give negative reviews, especially based on a single experience, but I gotta give an three star(average in my book) rating to this visit."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that on my 3rd attempt at trying to get a table here, I finally ate dinner at the Taphouse tonight. Every other time  there was either a ridiculous wait, or they were closed down for an hour between lunch and dinner (who does that...this isn't some exclusive spot in NYC or something). Anyway, I wanted to know what all the buzz was about. We had the soft pretzel with beer cheese dip and fried smoked Gouda. Both were excellent tasting, but served at room temperature/verging on what I feel is too cold for a place with this type of reputation (hence the 3 star review.) We also had 2 burgers, which were cooked perfectly to our request for rare, tasted great, but nothing super out of the ordinary. The beer selection is fantastic here, and we ordered a Thirsty Dog 12 Dogs which was served in what looked like a high-ball glass....at $11 for 2, a little disappointed with that one. The atmosphere was cozy, and if you are a beer drinker this would be a great place to get a drink and hang out with some friends. If you are a Cleveland Foodie, its worth a shot, but don't expect anything mind blowing and don't wait more than t 10 minutes for a table. You could go around the corner to Southside or the Tree House and find bar food that is just as good, comparably priced, and without as much hype."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. Service was awesome, it was genuine not that fake smile you get. Talked to one of the cooks and from our conversation it seems like they enjoy making food and put the effort into it to make something tasty. He sounded passionate about it. It wasn't one of the chefs but a cook. If the chef is presenting that kind of feeling towards a kitchen and food it is definitely apparent with his staff. I would go back for the food alone not to mention their fantastic selection of beer"}
{"text":"Tap House has got a fun atmosphere, funky menu, and impressive beer selection. Sounds like a dream, eh?

I had the strangely intriguing Moules Frites-- fries and mussles topped with bleu cheese, bacon, shallots, garlin, and sitting in a Belgian beer broth. Sound interesting enough? In addition to being a surprising combination of ingredients, it was delicious! Now to be honest, I am not a bleu cheese fan, not even a bit, but the cheese they use is so mild even I could handle it. 

And the beers! Ohhh man, the beers. I spent 10 minutes staring at that long list before I could finally make my choice. I got a taste of the Ithaca Flower Power and the Roque Hazelnut Brown. The Flower Power is a citrusy, flowery, hoppy beer. Good choice in you're into that. But the Hazelnut Brown, wowweeee. This thing was smooth, nutty, deep, dark.... everything you'd expect from a name like that. 

Yes, there was a long wait. And yes, it'd be nice if it were a tad cheaper. But regardless of all that, this place serves up to its promise- good beer and good food."}
{"text":"Trendy little place in Tremont with a great beer selection and excellent food.  Read  that it tends to get crowded, so we went a little early and had no problem getting a table.  Service was great, though I can imagine it might get a little worse when the place is packed.

I had a burger which was cooked to perfection and accompanied with awesome fries.  Like the rest of the menu, the burger was pretty inventive with caramelized onions, swiss cheese, and a fried egg on top.  

Great time all around."}
{"text":"OY vey. 

Ok, I am not subtracting a star, because I love Christian and the Tap House like a love song, but I just have to say that its Sunday brunch needs to get its act together. I recently came in with a large group (we had a reservation), and we had a baby (duh). We were seated at a high-top so that the high chair was actually a low chair. I admit that I was asked over the phone that morning when I was confirming the reservation if this was ok. But what was I gonna say? No? We had a group of 8 coming in and I wasn't about to try to find another location an hour before we were supposed to meet. I had been told the day before that we'd be seated upstairs at a lower table. I will also add that, before reserving the table at Tap House, I made sure it would be ok for the baby and that they had high chairs, etc. I know about not bringing babies to a non-baby friendly place. But based on what they said, and on the fact that we've brought her there before, I knew it would not be inappropriate. Anyway.

Then we met our waitress, who was one of the most unfriendly, bitter, sharp waitresses I have ever had the \"pleasure\" of dining with. She seemed like she didn't want to be there, and it was only ten minutes after the place opened!

After waiting far too long, our food came out ... cold. Everyone's was cold! The ones that weren't sent back by our table belonged to people who were way too nice to say anything. (In case you're wondering, I was not one of those people...hehe.) What did the waitress do while all this was going down? Did she apologize or anything? Nope. The only acknowledgment that she made was to say \"It's not my fault.\" It probably wasn't -- but damn, your job is to serve us the best you can. A little explanation and a smile would have gone a long way.

I will say that Christian came over to us and apologized himself, and also gave us a substantial discount on our check. So that was great and we all appreciated it. I just wish that they didn't have to \"make up for stuff\" all the time with the Sunday brunch. I love brunch! I want to love Tap House's brunch. Make it happen, please?!?"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I am hungry everything tastes delicious however my most recent brunch experience here was amazing!! 

I ordered the Braised Beef Hash has that was out of this world! I ate every bite of my food and want to go back and order the same thing even though I really want to try the entire brunch menu! This is one of those places that you visit over and over again so you can try everything on the menu! I also ordered a pineapple mimosa (I don't like OJ) and boy oh boy was that a big mimosa! Definitely worth the money here!"}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is the inevitable wait to get seated or stake out a seat at the bar.

Everything I've ever had here is delicious--salads (apple fennel, YES!), burgers (the Joshua!), appetizers (soft pretzels!), oh my! 

The beer selection is an attraction on its own. If you're having trouble deciding, the staff will gladly help and encourage questions, since (and their menu even notes this) if you buy a beer, you can't return it. Logical! 

The brunch is equally impressive with a variety of interesting food and drink options. The bloody mary is amazing!

Overall, I don't have much to say because I'm just so pleased with this place."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe at Tremont Tap House. This is one of my favorite bar restaurants. 

To start, all of the staff are wonderful, helpful, laid back and knowledgeable. The food and beer menu also rock. 

We were lucky enough to get an outside table on a busy Saturday night which was delightful. We both tried a bunch of beers and they were all good. The selection is amazing and it rotates. The food is great too which you don't expect in a bar like this. It is consistently delicious. We had the mussels and fries to start...so hard to resist ordering this dish. Then I had the soba noodle salad which was flavorful and fresh. My husband had the green chili burger which may have been one of the best burgers ever and we've had our share. 

Parking is always a challenge, but it is worth it. I highly recommend this place for a laid back evening."}
{"text":"Always a good deal here. Has a great menu of bar food, and just had brunch the other day which was awesome. Great beer selection. Wait staff is always really friendly, generally a little overwhelmed. Have been to a couple private parties here and always a great place. Patio with fire pit is always great for fall nights. Such a solid place for beer and food. Always a good choice."}
{"text":"This was our third trip to the Taphouse, but if we lived in CLE we would be regulars. We brought our kids, and were treated very well. The poutine is a must-have. The pork belly nachos are also great. My son ordered them without beans and jalepenos, but the spicy cheese and picked onions made them delicious! Three of us devoured various burgers, and I had the flank steak handheld. I though there was a bit too much baguette  for my liking, so I ended up eating the interior of the sammy with a fork-but that's just my weirdness. Our server was very busy but still managed to be pretty attentive. 

If you're wondering...go! Delicious food and many many awesome beer choices."}
{"text":"This neighborhood Gastropub is a bit \"under the radar\"...which is both a good thing and a bad thing, if you know what I mean.

I have eaten here a half-dozen times and have NEVER been disappointed in a single thing we've ordered.  The food quality and presentation have always been top-notch and the vibe there is laid back and cool.

On this trip my wife and I shared a few items (as we usually do so that we can try more stuff!)...Moule Fries, Apple & Fennel salad and a bacon & blue cheese burger.  We started off the evening with drinks (Moscow Mule's) followed shortly thereafter with the Moule Fries and salad, concluding with a (shared) burger..

The Moule Fries were fantastic...a generous portion of mussels drowning in a divine broth, flanked by bits of pork belly and a mountain of crispy fries.  The only thing that would have made the dish better was some bread to soak up the delicious broth.

The apple and fennel salad is an old favorite, and once again it met the mark.  The fresh-shaved Parmesan cheese grated over the top really adds a wonderful kick to the dish and compliments the apples perfectly.

For our actual dinner selection, we split my wife's favorite burger...the bacon and blue cheese and we substituted grilled brussel sprouts as our side.  Quite simply...this is the BEST burger in Cleveland...period!  We've eaten a LOT of burgers in this town, and Tremont Tap House's version is just that good...perfectly cooked to a mid-rare, dripping with juices and flavor, crispy bacon...what more could you want?

It is always a joy to come to this restaurant, you should give it a try too!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. I had the house salad and a side of Mac and cheese, both were full of flavor and well executed. The salad was simple but truly one of the best salads I've had. Mac had the perfect amount of cheese and had a really great texture, not too thick, not grainy like some can get and definitely not dry. Overall really happy with everything. Server was helpful and even gave me the recipe for the dressing !"}
{"text":"Four stars for the beer! Wandered into this place while in Cleveland- and I am glad that I did! A really deep place with a cool atmosphere, good service, and decent food, but the beer list is the reason for the season. I saw longer beer lists in Cleveland, but I must say that I did not see a better one. I like trying a lot of different beer, and Tremont really has an all-star lineup there. Check it out, but I would assign a designated driver beforehand because every beer will make you want another."}
{"text":"Wow! The Mac and cheese with chorizo and the chorizo tacos were the best I've had. Can't wait to come me back for more! Great selection of local beers!"}
{"text":"Just went there for brunch.  Without a doubt one of the worse meals of my entire life. 
The drinks and beer are really good. The service if top notch. 
Ordered the chorizo burrito. It was the most bland meals ever.  The chorizo had no flavor and the sour cream was rancid."}
{"text":"After looking up Cleveland's 15 best burgers on line I was surprised to see a place that I hadn't heard of before. Being no stranger to excellent burgers made by Cleveland's best independent eateries I wondered how The Tremont Tap House had gotten by me. So the wife and I got a babysitter and headed out to see what we were missing...WOW! We were missing a lot! We did a beer sampler before picking our favorites. We went for burgers and left completely satisfied. This place definitely belongs on the list of C-town's best burgers. 
  This place was packed, yet we only waited about 10 minutes and then we were taken and seated upstairs by the kitchen. (We thought that it was pretty cool) The staff was excellent, professional, and quick. The bartender was helpful in helping us decide which beers to try. Parking was the only downside to the night. But what do you expect in Tremont?!?!"}
{"text":"Met some friends out this last weekend at Tap House in Tremont. I have only had beers there up until this weekend and I do have to say I was pleasantly surprised but the quality of food I was served. I had the happy hour burger along with the Calamari! The Calamari has a really interesting flavor to it with just the right amount of heat at the end. The burger was absolutely perfectly cooked and could not have been better. 

I highly recommend for an evening out after work to partake in their great food and extensive beer list.."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time fav craft beer bars. The selection is always spot on and the staff is always willing to help. Have not tried any food yet, but hope to someday."}
{"text":"Having been here on a few separate occasions I have never been disappointed. They have a great beer selection and the food is outright fantastic. My most recent visit for brunch last weekend was one that solidified that not only do they have great food their staff make your dining experience even better.

It was a busy day for brunch, seats filled with loyal browns fans present to eat, drink and watch the game. With any crowded restaurant/bar there is the fear that service may be lacking but that is far from true in this situation. We grabbed a few mimosas (quite sizable for the cost) from the bar as we waited for an empty table.  Our waiter Cristobal was upbeat and attentive, answering our questions even before we asked them. With so many delicious dishes on the menu he was helpful in deciding which to order. I landed on the breakfast pizza and it was so tasty.

Our waiters witty sense of humor along with our delicious brunch dishes, made our brunch experience one to remember. Whether you come for brunch or dinner this place is a must visit."}
{"text":"Usually pretty crowded, and noisy.  The clientele seem to be a mix of hipsters and yuppies, and it has the feel of a happening joint.  Decent beer selection, the food is pretty good, but I liked the bone-in ribeye steak better when they weren't aging the beef in house.  Since they started doing that, it's merely a decent steak, not really worth what they charge for it -- you can get the same quality elsewhere for around $15."}
{"text":"I came here again last night, after first refusing due to constantly being overcharged for items, but I gave in. They have a lovely patio and figured that Cleveland is too small for boycotts (long live my boycott of Hollywood Video, however). I addressed the issue with the waitress who seemed shocked and she made sure my bill was correct. If these sorts of things didn't make me so angry, and if I didn't have the tendency to cry whenever I enter into confrontation, no matter how silly, I would have addressed the issues upon the date of their occurrence. 

The Tremont Tap House has been redeemed, but my friend noted they need a better sign on the outside. The sign they have is electronic and scrolls so she drove past it several times before catching the sign at the perfect moment to read Tremont Tap House."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but get here while you can. It fills up ridiculously fast.

Massive beer selection (they actually have cider too!) that really speaks for itself, but with a small and very upscale menu. Reasonable prices, and probably one of the best burgers i've ever had.

I really like the vibe here, and especially the food. Its not QUITE gastro-pubby its just good pub food that draws from old fashioned american food, some irish/english fare, and eastern european. Its a nice quiet gastric summation of Cleveland, and I can't wait to go back there to have more foo-make sure it still deserves the 5-stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food. So far above typical bar fare. Gastropub par excellence. Tap beer list as long as your arm of great beers. Start with the house brewed beers. You won't be sorry. And shout out to Gaby who took great care of us all night. She made sure we had everything we wanted."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cool, but the food is the main reason to come here!  This was my first visit, and will not be my last.  I had the Crab Benedict, and my boyfriend got Sausage Gravy & Biscuits.  He said it was the best he's ever had!  I have to say as someone who is a self proclaimed \"foodie\" I was VERY impressed!  They also have a extensive draft list which will not disappoint.  It's places like this that make Cleveland so unique, and I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome Pub/Restaurant.  There were 10 of us and Tops on our list was the Calamaria (best I've had), Joshua Burger, German Pretzel and White Pizza.  Was a little hesitant of the service we would get because of past reviews and our large group, but happy to say our hostess CAREY was absoulutely great. Patient w. us in answering all our questions and also in figuring out our bills.  A Wonderful evening out and Definitely a GO BACK to try more of their food.  A hidden gem in Treemont!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We accidentally stumbled upon this place and I am so glad we did!!!
I consider myself a \"beer snob\" and I fit right in here! They had an amazing selection of beer on tap - something for everyone AND their prices were great!! We both had burgers - mine was a little salty - but they were both very good. Our service was great and we sat outside on their patio. We even chatted with the couple at the table next to us. 
We do not live on this side of town, but I think we would venture over again just to visit the Tremont Tap House. LOVED this place!"}
{"text":"Have been about 6 times. Disclaimer: it has been about 2months. I have yet to have a menu item I do not like. Occasional ok items. Usually very good. Great beer selection. What a gastro pub should be."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Cleveland Ohio for a little weekend getaway. I googled and did a lot of research on places to get a great burger. the 2 that came up a lot were Tremont tap house and Bspot burgers.  Well In my opinion Tremont topped Bspot burgers with no competition. 

We arrived and from the outside looks like a little hole in the wall place, but when you walk in it livens up real quick. they were able to seat us right away and within a few seconds our waitress greeted us, very friendly and with a big smile. We ordered a couple beers. With a burger I always order some kind of IPA, I feel that they pair amazingly with burgers. I wanted to try sometrhing I have not had before and being from grand rapids michigan , cleveland had a lot I have not heard of. She was very knowledgeable of the beers on tap and bottled and was even nice enough to let us sample some of the beers on tap. We finaly chose our beer and next up were the burger choices.

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger plain but you can't go wrong with that. I ordered my burger and both my wife and I asked for it to be medium rare. They brought out the burger with fries . Gotta say these fries were amazing. I bit into my burger to find a warm pink lightly bloody perfectly cooked center in the middle. Oh my I was in heaven, and the beer was the perfect ending to the pallet. 

I would for sure come here again and to those who read and have not been there go try it out. Yes there burgers are a little more pricey but for a good burger you can't put a price on it...."}
{"text":"Always great...but what's up with the macaroni and cheese lately?  Seasonal vegetable added?  We asked for it without the vegetable and it came loaded with onions (not normal).  Otherwise, the Joshua burger with an egg is KILLER.  Fries are great.  Everything is great.  Service at the bar is hit or miss sometimes..."}
{"text":"Man where to start, been frequenting this place for a while now, bars fantastic with awesome cocktails, never had a bad one, now the food is very \" local\" and flavorful they have all these twists and reinventing classics, not to mention dog friendly with yappy hour!"}
{"text":"We dined here a week ago and we have been here several times for drinks and one other time for dinner. Our first dinner experience was great. It was a perfect little date night.  This past time was AWFUL, our waiter seemed to rather be doing anything but working, he seemed annoyed, and completely bothered to be waiting on us.  So that was the first issue. Our drinks were constantly empty. When my husband asked for a second beer he brought him the wrong one when he told him he seemed highly annoyed that HE brought the wrong beer to the table? We had no silverware so we had to get up and get our own. ( which we took from a basket by the bar )  Our food took a pretty long time to come out.  ( appetizers and dinner ) One of our burgers was practically still alive so that was sent back but we had to give it back to another worker as our server was no where to be found.  Then, one of our meals did not arrive at the table.  So one person got their dinner when our entire table was done eating.  He said sorry but again really didn't seem to care much. It was taken off the couples bill but .. our bills all had auto gratuity of 20% added to them.  We are normally 20% tippers or higher but there is NO WAY I would have left a 20% tip. I mean for what?  So the way our entire table looked at it was \" it doesn't matter what service I give them because I'm going to get a 20% tip no matter what. \" Really disappointing.  Oh, did I mention 80% of our food was cold but since we waited so long we just ate it anyway.  I'm not a crappy review writer typically but this entire situation has been bothering me since our experience.  We will not return unfortunately."}
{"text":"I had never been here for brunch before and am so happy my friends decided that we'd check it out! We got there around 10:30 and it wasn't that busy from what I could see (they have the bar area and then an upstairs, which I never saw). I was immediately sat and was greeted by our very friendly server. Since we were there before 11 on a Sunday, we weren't able to get the Bloody Mary's but they DID have mimosas readily available. One thing to note: their mimosas are made with a cider and OJ, not champagne...still very delicious! Also, one of the girls I was with did end up getting the Bloody Mary after 11 and said it was spicy! It's also made with the Effen Cucumber vodka. 

Onto the food: SO GOOD. I opted for one of the omelettes: goat cheese, wild mushrooms and fresh herbs with a side of the potato hash (really just diced roasted delicious potatoes). One of my friends got the buttermilk pancakes (came with a bowl of fruit) and a side of the Butcher and Brewer bacon. The other got the eggs benedict, which also came with the potato hash. We all loved our meals and thought it was one of the better ones that we've been to."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the \"mac and cheese mood,\" there is no doubt I'm going to Tremont Tap House. I can honestly say it is the best in Cleveland. That says a lot since mac and cheese is usually my go to on the menu when I go out. The additional chorizo on top is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Decent beer selection. Best part of the place. We just stopped in for drinks on the patio. Had a bit of an issue parking. It was crowded and we searched for parking could find anything. Lucked out when someone left and we snagged the spot. Spent at least 10 mins parking though. That was a pain. Did not eat. But food smelled good. Seemed pricey. But it's a hip place so they can get away with it. Not sure if price worth the food. Since I did not eat I may not be the best judge. 

Service staff very nice. The patio was nicely setup and decorated. They allow dogs. It was nice seeing all types of people on a sunny afternoon hanging out."}
{"text":"Tremont Tap House is a friendly environment with amazing food. There is something for everyone on their extensive beer menu. My favorite appetizer would be the Mole Frites, you get a ton of mussels topped with hand cut french fries topped with bacon and then topped with blue cheese...lots of toppings there! I have far too many go-to's on this menu but the Joshua Burger is always my fall back.

Sunday brunch is very busy but well worth the wait. The brunch menu has a vast selection that yields to those in search of breakfast or a burger. Be sure to try their version of a mimosa which is Vander Mill Cider and OJ..yum!"}
{"text":"First time here. .. upon entering noticed tables were full.  Walked up to the hostess who stared at us like we aliens. We left..so can't comment on food but expect a hostess to offer time on tables...reservation recommendations..etc vs. Looking at us like wtf are u doing here?  If the hostess with the mole on her cheek isn't there. .. May go back and try the food"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome place for food and drinks.  Huge beer selection...I suggest getting the sampler.  

As far as the food is concerned, it's really good.  Burgers are juicy, fries are great, and the pizza hits the spot.  The food comes out pretty quickly, which kinda scares me, but the service is on point and nice.

The price is a little on the pricier side for a bar, but it's merely a matter of you deciding between price and quality.  I suggest leaning towards quality...worth the money."}
{"text":"Solid all around.  Stopped by TT on our way out of Cleveland.  It is a gastropub disguised as a dive bar!  We started off with a flight, and I loved each beer I had.  The Butcher and the Brewer taps---Yum.  My husband and I then shared the Mexican corn and Bahn mi.  The corn was a home run.  We enjoyed the Bahn mi, though my husband--being more of a Bahn mi connoisseur than myself--said he had had better (including that for any Bahn mi snobs out there).  We had fries and mac and cheese as sides which were both delectable.  Crispy, perfectly seasoned fries!  Our service was slightly slow at first, but our waitress had just tapped a new beer and brought us a small sample for our wait--great service recovery on her part!"}
{"text":"How do you write a review for a place that is hands down amazing? Well..... let's start with the beer list, mind-boggling. The food, simply delicious and always intriguing. And the service is always a delight (sometimes they're quite busy but they seem to run around and get everything done to perfection!) 

Sunday brunch is always a treat especially if you can manage a seat on the patio. Even when it's a little chilly you can grab a spot by the (very cool) fire pit and when the wind blows just right you are toasty warm, or maybe that's just the beer kicking in?!! 

Highly recommend the TapHouse to anyone who likes great food and has a eclectic palette for beer........."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere special for my husband to untap his 500th beer on Untapped, and we certainly found the spot! 
Staff is very beer-knowledgeable, and the beer list is probably the most extensive one in Cleveland. Since the breakthrough 500th beer, we visited again and sat downstairs, enjoying the nachos as an appetizer before ordering dinner elsewhere. All in all, a fun and local place to try new beers or enjoy some classy craft favorites."}
{"text":"Very nice beer selections.  Wait staff are knowledgeable and helpful if you don't know what type of beer to order.  You can also order a flight of beer (4) 4 oz. glasses for $10.  

The food is also very good!  Gotta love Tremont!"}
{"text":"Still a great beer joint, but whoever said they are pet friendly is wrong. Tried to grab a beer on the patio with the pooch after the Tremont Greek deal and it was a no go. Could be the two people I spoke to didn't know what they were talking about, but I was too tired to argue. Apparently it's \"illegal\" to have dogs on the patio, except on Tuesdays during happy hour, when it is totally kosher. Eh, whatevah..."}
{"text":"Can this place please move to NYC??  So great on every level!  Great beers.  Great service.  Great atmosphere, inside and on the patio.  The only thing that wasn't super-stellar was the food.  The hollandaise sauce on the crab benedict wasn't authentic hollandaise (though yummy), and the burger didn't rock my date's world either.  But, it was far from disappointing.  We left stuffed, tanned and happy."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to try Tremont Taphouse, to me it looked like a normal Gastropub, but I was very surprised with it. Great food and an amazing beer selection with really good vibes to watch sports on TV . The only part I didn't like was the happy hour wasn't a great deal. I believe it was $5 for a beer and no food specials. My meal ended up being pretty pricey for a Thursday night bite after work."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on the patio. Great atmosphere  and I absolutely love the patio. They have a massive selection of beers on tap. Which is great for your beer drinkers but they didn't have a cocktail menu for the non beer drinkers. No wine or cocktail menu. Food was above avg. good food quality but lacking in quantity on my sandwich. Could've been a simple mistake but I would get the sandwich again to see if it's the same way. Can't wait to enjoy cocktails on this patio again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty sweet! I've been to the Tremont Tap House twice already, and both times I have been really impressed. They market themselves as a \"gastropub\" serving upscale bar food at reasonable prices.  I've had their hamburger which was one of the best I've had in Cleveland -- it can give the burger at Old Angle a run for its money! I've also had their scallops w/ mushroom risotto which was really good, too. The calamari is served with a delicious spicy pepper sauce, not your typical fried up with pasta sauce deal. They serve hot pretzel appetizers with fresh pretzels from Zoss bakery. I really like how they are taking advantage of local Cleveland products! The beer list is pretty insane (being a Tap House) too. 

The bar itself is pretty laid back. There is a long polished concrete bar with booths and tables alongside the walls. Get there on the earlier side to secure a booth or table, because both times I have been there the seating has been full. I can't speak for the men's room, but the women's room is beautifully done with tile and modern fixtures and very clean. The service is very friendly and attentive. 

The only thing that needs improvement is their website --  a real domain name is in order!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I've found this place. I've been there twice for brunch and once for dinner and pleased all three times.

I am impressed by the quality of the food and the eclectic menu. Its not too large and I have always found something good. My husband enjoys the chorizo omelette. Today I was wowed by the fruit and yogurt granola bowl.  The bowl was huge and full of delicious granola, honey, pecans, yogurt, and so much fruit. Not just the usual afterthought of melon and grapes.  This breakfast bowl had blueberries, raspberries, mango, melon, apples, grapes and they were all fresh and tasty.
The draft list always surprises me.  I adore anyplace that has Left Hand Milk Stout on draft.

Really great patio. It is the only place we've sat. 

I wish they had a sign."}
{"text":"I love Brussel sprouts so naturally I had to try the pizza. I loved it but beware it has a lot of blue cheese- so I'd you don't like that (unlike me) go for another pizza. 

Also tried some of my boyfriends Joshua burger which was tasty - he didn't add anything. It they have a list of options including a fried egg.

I loved the local beers on tap- so many from butcher and Brewer on e4.

My one complaint is. We made a reservation for a party of 10 and had to wait a half hour to be seated when we arrived due to other parties taking longer. We were not comped for this is any way and the service seemed annoyed that the big group of us were congregating and getting in there way in the small room between the bar and the seats . I'm hoping this was a one off instance bc the food was good."}
{"text":"Not on the main strip of bars surrounding Lincoln Park in Cleveland's uber-trendy Tremont neighborhood, the Tap House is worth the two block trip and the troll toll under the I-71 overpass.

The crowd is generally hipsters who will claim that they've known the place was cool since the early 90's and some smarmy suburbanites (presumably because the Tap House sponsors a rowing club)... i was ready to hate both groups until the browns game comes on the tv and the great unifying force of North East Ohio created a bucolic, judgmelentless atmosphere the likes of which have never been seen.

While the bar is \"charming\" (see: small) I've been here between 7-10 times and it's never been overly crowded. there are some booths, but if you want a seat, you're probably going to have to find a table or belly up. The bar recently finished its outdoor patio which seems a little out of place, but still nice nonetheless. It looks like something that belongs in Rocky River, but it doubles the seating in the warmer months, and I'm generally pretty geeked about drinking outdoors anyway, so I suppose I approve. 

The food is delicious. Most bars have a short order cook, but the Tap House has a \"chef.\" I was unaware of the distinction before talking to the guy, but apparently to be a chef you have to have attended some sort of school... whatever the distinction, this guy knows his stuff. On the bartender's recommendation, I had the german pretzel with stout cheese sauce as a starter. Absolutely kick-ass with the Left Hand Milk Stout that I ordered earlier. I later had the half chicken, which was equally amazing with a Lagunitas Little Sumpin Sumpin IPA. 

This brings me to the beer selection. It's exhaustive. Stouts, IPAs, Black IPAs, Porters, Ales... you name it, they have your style. The best part though, is trying the recommendations from the very knowledgable staff. The Tap House has rotating taps, so there is always something new to try.

If you're like me and hate pretty much everyone, but love good food and beer, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection, the staff is knowledgeable about beer styles and pairing. The food is good, and they have a great patio. It's a great casual place to hang out in Tremont."}
{"text":"After doing a lot of walking around at the market, we decided to give this place a try and I'm so glad we did! The Pollinator totally quenched my thirst and I was so pleased with the waiters suggestion since I was overwhelmed at all the different options! The service was impeccable. One of my friends I was with went through about 4 glasses of water and before she was even finished with one, he had another one on the table. 
We split the Chorizo Tacos and the House Fries with Jalepeno aioli and I cant say enough about either. The tacos had chorizo (with a kick) goat cheese and very fresh salsa. Some of the best tacos I've ever had!! The fries were perfectly cut, cooked and seasoned with salt  that the aioli was an incredible bonus. I honestly wanted to drink the aioli, it was that good! I'd put that shit on everything if I had the recipe!! :)
We sat inside since the outside patio was full but I liked that they had both. They had a movie screen out on the patio as well, as they do a movie night once a week. I love when places like this incorporate fun activities as well! So glad we ventured outside downtown Cleveland to this gem."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. Over 50 on tap. Food is amazing, they keep it simple with the classics. Had the turkey club, so good.

You can also write on the bar tops with chalk. Classy move on their part. 

Good vibes all around."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood bar.  The beer list is constantly evolving and the food is truly wonderful.  The summer season brings back Monday movie night on the patio, and yappy hour every Tuesday (pet friendly on the patio).  The staff will take the time to educate you on the beer list, or to suggest something new. 

The food is really wonderful.  There is something about the jalapeno aioli that accompanies the house fries that is truly delicious.  I've danced all around the menu... and the one thing not to miss - the chorizo tacos.  They are perfection in a bite - savory, spicy, citrus from the lime.  Truly a  delight.  If you a pierogi lover try their pierogi appetizer - fried pierogis in bath of sour cream and onion sauce.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great food, great beers. They have a lot of good beers on tap. The food was good too. I just got a burger and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Beyond amazing food! Great service! In a crazy spot of town but well worth it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our second or third visit to Tremont Tap House, and I think it gets better every time. Service was quick and friendly. Their beer selection was fantastic - I'm usually bored by the standard list of craft beers and they had some unique options to tempt us. While we were there they rotated a few of the taps, a good sign.

My husband ordered the Joshua burger with the works (egg, mushrooms, onions) and it was excellent. Cooked perfectly and well-seasoned, with a soft buttery bun. Next time I'd skip all of the extra toppings and just go with LTO, as to not distract from the flavorful meat! I ordered the Lamb burger, which was topped with mushrooms, fontina cheese, and a jalapeno aioli. Again the meat was well-seasoned (one of our usual sticking points!) and the well-integrated toppings deviated from the standard (read boring) feta/spinach/lamb variety. The french fries were crisp and not oily, and sprinkled with a smattering of sea salt. 

I'd go back for the beer selection alone, but now won't miss one of their excellent burgers as the perfect accompaniment."}
{"text":"Good vibe, great food.  
Friends brought me over to Tremont for dinner and we had a good time catching up here.  The music was 90s so it fit in with the reminiscing.
Oysters were good, I wish the serving was a little bigger.  I had the Pesto Chicken Pizza - solid.  Jenny had the Grilled Cheese which looked terrific.  And Ted had the White Fish (daily special), he cleaned his plate.
Apparently it has a great beer selection but the descriptions were a little vague and I didn't find one I loved.  
I definitely recommend this place and if I were a local this would probably be a regular spot on the rotation."}
{"text":"My husband I and had dinner here and absolutely loved it.  The atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient.  Event he gentleman who just ran out our food, was really polite.
If you go here, eat the pierogies!  They're incredibly tasty!
My only complaint was the music, lousy autotuned pop music that didn't suit the environment at all."}
{"text":"Great place. Clean. Good atmosphere.  Food decent.  Beer list real nice. Outdoor patio decent."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. The first time was for a first date, the second was for our three month anniversary :). This place will always have a spot in our hearts. The food has always been good when we visited, and the beer selected is fantastic. We've had the veggie burgers, fried gouda, german pretzel with stout cheese sauce, and mac and cheese. It's all veryyyy good. The mac and cheese is heavenly! The veggie burger is the Morningstar Black Bean Chipotle burger (I survived on these throughout college). While it's good, I wish the patty itself was homemade.

Some aspects of our second visit were a bit weird. I guess our server changed halfway through, but we weren't told. It was just a bit odd when a new server came to us asking if we needed anything. She was a bit cold, and did the bare minimum to qualify as providing service.  Also, the fact that they don't have a dessert menu makes a tiny bit of sense, but it was still disappointing. The only dessert they had was a salted caramel goat cheese ice cream (two of my favorite things combined). We ordered that, and were disappointed when they put a small, quarter cup sized plastic cup in front of us with spoons. No presentation, nothing. It was delicious, but I didn't expect it to be served that way."}
{"text":"Outdoor area to enjoy the summer weather, coupled with a large open-air window behind the indoor bar.

Beer menu should satisfy any connoisseur.  Food was very solid for a bar.  Not the place to watch a game but great spot for a chill, group hangout..."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was atrocious. Our server Seth stared at me while I looked at the menu, then got mad and walked away when I needed a minute. When my friend ordered a shot he told her they didn't have the liquor she requested even though it was visible behind the bar. When he brought the shot back he threw it on he table to the point where it actually bounced. He did nothing to accommodate our group's size and was mad when we moved to a larger table so we could all sit together. The bartenders would not acknowledge us. Absolutely terrible, we will never be back!"}
{"text":"This isn't your typical bar. The tap list is obviously great. They offer a loft of great craft options from all over. The food is exceptional. Happy hour is until 6PM. They offer great burgers, hand heads, pizza and dinner entrees. They offered a bison burger that was a special that I really enjoyed. The burger was cooked perfectly. Would definitely recommend for a night out of the kitchen during the week. Casual and great service."}
{"text":"Tremont redeemed a weekend trip to Cleveland that was threatening to end badly. Hooray! Went here for brunch on my way out of town and I am so glad I did.

So many taps and interesting beers, including lots of Ohio brews. We went for Sunday brunch and our group of four raved the entire time. It was nice to sit in a booth near the bar with the big window open.

Between the breakfast pizza (maybe a tad heavy on the hollandaise, but it was delicious), burrito, and duck confit stuffed waffles, there were lots of smiles going around. I appreciate any establishment that offers a nice heavy breakfast beer (stouts & porters are my fav for that) and enjoyed myself thoroughly. Service was prompt and friendly. Wish I could come every weekend, and for happy hour, which looked to offer some good deals."}
{"text":"Called ahead and asked if they were busy for brunch. they said that they weren't. In the 15 minutes it took to get there, the place was filled with bikers or runner for some race. The hostess was no where to be found. 
We flagged a bartender only to find out that they had an abridged menu. Would have been nice to know that when we called. The only thing that we wanted wasn't on the menu. We promptly left."}
{"text":"Waiter forms an Ariel Castro meta-narrative when I ask for house salad. Brings a beer goblet that smells like old dishwater. Place has a bike box bigger than anyone's will to bike here as a destination. young Tremont couples like to go here, they want to go somewhere off the beaten path. Laugh out loud, I am a comedian. This place has malaise after the news story from a short walk away. You know its bad when the yuppies have humility."}
{"text":"Love the food here. I had the barn mi pork sand which and it's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. My fiancé also enjoyed his burger, we will be back. Also great beer selection."}
{"text":"I have been to the Tap House Many Times. 

It has an amazingly long and amazingly good beer list.  They do tons of seasonal beers (which is what I like) and have lots of good things to try.  Always changing and always with you favorites. Great GREAT list.

It has a great environment.  I think it has only been open so far in the cold months and it looks like it has a pretty huge, pretty nice patio.  I am planning on going back this weekend for a beer after the move to enjoy it. I like that it has chalkboards on the walls and on the bar so that you can write and joke while you drink.  The TVs are amazingly big and in great condition. You can watch sports from ANYWHERE in the bar.  It has very cool food.  I recommend the pizzas. They are warm pretzels with different things around, in them or to dip them in. VERY good.  Not cheap but good.  I also had the carrot cake. It was OK.

Only Downside: Some places are cool about Steelers games, this place is not. Its written write on a chalkboard: We do not play steelers games.

BEST PART: The booths. I love them. They can fit two or 6. They are intimate and even when the entire bar is packed, you can have a great conversation and hear your friends.  I love those booths. I might just go there just for them."}
{"text":"A place that has Left Hand Milk Stout on tap makes me very happy.  On a blustery Thursday with a randomly large party, the bartender made sure that everyone was happy and returned frequently to keep our thirst quenched and our tummies full.  Definitely a low-key kind of place with out pretension."}
{"text":"There's literally nothing else around this area, but this place is worth the trip.  Affordable and delicious!  Great beer selections and cool staff.  Really great ambiance too.  I've heard it gets really crowded, but at 5pm on a Saturday we had no trouble."}
{"text":"Went to tremont tap house for dinner Sunday , food was good had grilled cheese with bacon and my date had burger.  I did try some different beers, but disappointed they did not carry a regular bud light bottle for people who don't like all the flavored beers.  Overall good experience , parking is problem, but that is most places in tremont."}
{"text":"In the words of the immortal Luke Christmas...Sweet Christmas. Good food, Good Beer and they have parking."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Caesar in town. Great brunch and chorizo tacos. Hanger Steak n eggs. Great beer selection super friendly staff can't ask for much more. Great place to go late night as well. I love it there man I just do."}
{"text":"I had always enjoyed my experience at Tremont Tap House until last Friday. Made a reservation for two at 8pm. Arrived at 7:53pm and was told to sit at the bar and the hostess would come find us when the next table became available. We each ordered a beer, Stone's new brew (wonderful beer). We waited until 8:30pm and saw people who walked in after us were seated (two available tables). I went up and checked with the hostess and was told that there was still no available tables and some tables would open up soon. Eventually we had to leave and went to another bar because we were starving after 45 minutes' wait. I wish we had gotten food at Tremont Tap House since I like their burgers & salad. What a bummer!"}
{"text":"I really like the beer selection. I can almost always find at least one beer that I am excited to try. 
The food is very good and the menu is interesting. 
My only criticism is the service. It's often slow and sometimes the servers seem completely indifferent to the customers."}
{"text":"Love sitting outside on the patio on a beautiful day having lunch. The Diatihl Strawberry Blonde ale was great!  Eric was the best server we've ever had. He was very knowledgeable about the beer."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour Food! Tremont Tap House is one of my favorite happy hour stops especially since it goes until 7pm. Not only do they have great draft beers 1 dollar off but they have an amazing food menu to leave you full for under $20. The burger is one of the best in Cleveland and only $6 (add fries for $2). The calamari is $8 and smothered in a delicious sweet and spicy chilli sauce. The white pizza is great and a good size for only $5. The happy hour food menu also carries a large bavarian pretzel with beer cheese sauce on the side. 

The atmosphere is cozy for winter and the patio is great for summer."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheese steak period.   Hands down the best. Great selection of beer friendly atmosphere friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of the Tremont Taphouse since it first opened in 2007. The bar features over 100 different beers with half of those on tap. The cuisine is top notch, prepared to order and served fresh & piping hot. We visited early afternoon on a Saturday and the bar quickly filled by 5 PM. The bar service is usually great, but on this particular day it was challenging to get drinks and food orders placed, considering that five bartenders were on staff. Nevertheless, we ordered appetizers, I had Polenta Cakes & Taphouse Fries which arrived in a timely fashion and were very tasty. The overall vibe is very cool, especially the beer can collection at the end of the bar. Parking can be tricky if you arrive later in the evening, but well worth the effort. I highly recommend a visit to the Tremont Taphouse, particularly for a late lunch or early dinner. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and food to match!  

If you feel overwhelmed by the selection of beers on tap you can get a sampler of 4 x 4oz glasses for $10.

There's just always something great about this place to make you want to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Exciting beer menu with +100 options. Comfort dishes at very reasonable prices. This isn't a Canadian city (or Brooklyn) but they do have poutine on the menu (specifically, duck poutine).

I loved my burger - cooked to order, aged white cheddar, fries... only $10.

I was tempted by the German pretzel with milk stout and smoked cheddar dipping sauce and have heard good things about the mac & cheese from a trusted local. 

The $10 taster is a great way to sample 4 beers.

Coincidentally, our group was there the evening of their second annual Winterfest which included a 4 part frozen challenge (turkey bowling, puck shot, shuffle board and beer luge) with prizes and a selection of interesting winter brews. FUN! 

Excellent spot to go for lively winter drinks and eats with a group of friends."}
{"text":"So yes I work here as the Sous-chef so I may be biased but before I began working here in July, I had a really nice date with my boyfriend to check out the place and food to see if it would be a good fit for me. The FOH (front of house) staff was really nice and when I got to meet the BOH ( back of house) guys they were really cool and welcoming too!! We got the montes frites, pork belly nachos and had some cocktails and everything was awesome!! Even if I didn't work at Tremont TapHouse I would definitely come back. The atmosphere is great especially when there are games going on!! Everyone gets so hyped!! #SundayBrunch Come check us out!!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the beer selection, this place would absolutely receive 1 star. The food was over priced, yet under seasoned and underwhelming! By no means am I opposed to paying $12 for a burger, but this was not worth the calories at all."}
{"text":"Tremont Tap House has awesome food and a great atmosphere, and I typically crave their black bean burgers. This review is about service. 

We've had a good experience before with calling in and putting on name on the call-in list (not a reservation but basically prioritizes you before walk ins). I made a call today around lunch to be seated for dinner with an out of town guest, but when we arrived (on time), our name was not on the list. I showed the hostess my phone to prove that I had called earlier, and I lingered and tried to see if we would get expedited to the top of the list... But she kept telling us sorry, and that we had to wait about an hour, the normal waiting time for walk-ins. 

Unfortunately, this lack of accommodation has really set back the tap house as a go-to place. In my opinion, when the fault is yours and not the customer's, you go out of the way to help them and make sure they get the service they need.

We left to go to another place."}
{"text":"So I have been to the Tap House 4 times now and all have been fairly enjoyable experiences. First off, the building sits in a shady area of Tremont so the first time we came here, it was a bit of a surprise to find it so comfortable and nice on the inside.

We have had a prix fixe New Year's meal here which alone would have given this place 5 stars because of how awesome it was, but after a few more times, our expectations are now tempered to around a 4-4.5. Recently, we have been huge on the gastropub kind of place where you can get great food along with a good selection of beer and Tremont Tap House definitely fits that mold.

Most recently, we tried their sunday brunch with some friends. Once again, their tap selection never disappoints and I love how you can sample with a smaller half portion of beer or go with the full 10-14 ounce normal size; they also offer flights of their ever changing drafts. My boyfriend got their special omelet with braised beef, onion and pablano peppers and I got their breakfast pizza. Both were fairly appetizing, but the pizza was too oily and the omelet didn't have the best taste. I have seen people complain about their service, but in our instance, everything went fine.

All in all, I would come again, maybe not for dinner, but for their small plates and beers. Its always a good time here as long as the beer is flowing."}
{"text":"Decent food with a fairly good amount of beer and local drinks to choose from.  Be sure to hit up happy hour here if you have the chance, as some of their tap drinks are $1 off and they have discounted food.

Try their white pizza and their sliders, both absolutely delicious, the white pizza is $4 off during happy hour!  Good place to relax afterwork.  Only downside is I'm on the East side Cleveland it's a good 25-30 min away from me.  Also, be on the lookout for parking as their lot is on the smaller side of parking lots"}
{"text":"I took the advice of a fellow yelper and tried this place out.I had biscuits and gravy with A few Southern Tier IPA'S to put it down with.The service was decent but my friend Paul(A HILLBILLY) claimed \"SAME RACE RACISM\" because the hipster bartender took 20 minutes to get his drink to him.Besides that the staff was very chatty and nice atleast to me.The beer selection is \"BIG I MEAN VERY BIG\" and I even saw wildberry meade on the list.To me you cant go wrong with the Tremont Tap House and I will be back in the near future!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers and calamari are fantastic (the rest of the food's good too!), and the beer menu is unbeatable. If you can get a seat outside it's a fantastic place to visit. If you have to sit inside, you'll be deaf from the over-loud tvs that are everywhere, and the blaring music. I wish they'd make it a little more appropriate for friends to gather and talk.  I only go in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and a brew about 20 mind before a Cavs playoff game and managed to get a table outside.  +1  Excellent beer selection.   The German pretzel is worth it for the smokey cheddar sauce alone,  delicious.  Wife had the white pizza and I had the Chorizo pizza which was amazing.  Perfect individual size also.  We will definitely be back.  Service was good for being busy on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"I came to the Tremont Taphouse patio on Saturday afternoon with 2 girlfriends (and her puppy!) We spent the afternoon walking around Tremont and shopping. It was a beautiful afternoon, so my friend suggested stopping at the Tremont Taphouse for an early dinner/late lunch! 

Being from Pittsburgh, we don't have the restaurant patios that seem to be all over Clevland! I loved these patios- especially Tremont Taphouse! It was so cute and perfect for a well spent afternoon with good friends and good food! If you love beer, I would check this place out! They had a huge draft list that made it hard to pick one! It took a while for our server to take our drink orders, but when she finally did we all ordered different IPA's. 

They had a pretty big menu with a lot of different things that I don't typically see. It was hard to decide but 2 of us ended up ordering the Chicory salad with chicken. This salad was seriously amazing! It had leafy lettuce, roasted grapes, toasted cashews, and a beer vinaigrette. It was so light and the perfect meal! My other friend ordered the salmon BLT which was just as amazing as it sounds! Great place in Tremont!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Love the pirogies! Had an amazing brunch with unexpectedly good mimosas. The eggs Benedict are delicious as are the waffles. Can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"awesome tap selection (obvi), the pizzas are good too but the pricing is a little too steep for my taste. I mean the food portions are big enough to fill you but i just feel like you can get more for your money elsewhere. not knocking this place by any means, the outside seating area is nice for a spring day but can fill up quickly. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly, they know their ish when it comes to beer. If you're a beer connoisseur this place is for you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing food, and friendly service! We came here in a large group of 15 for a friend's birthday, and they were able to accomodate the cake and provide us with plates at no extra cost! 

I ordered the chorizo tacos, and holy cow, these were so good that I consumed all three in less than a minute! I also tried a bite of my friend's Joshua burger, which was equally amazing!! 

There's a small parking lot behind the restaurant along with ample street parking."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal here with a friend last week. I really wanted to try the lamb burger but they happened to be out if it, so i went with the salmon blt and romaine salad.. so so delicious. Everything had the perfect amount of flavor, crunch and savoryness. My friend had the macaroni and cheese with a side of asparagus and it was equally as good. Although on the small side, this place has a warm and cozy atmosphere and a very nice beer selection. Our server was very sweet and and always on top of things especially being that she was also downstairs bartending! Will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"Whoa!   Pork belly nachos.   The memory of this delishous-ness will linger.

Lamb burger.  Yum.  The mushrooms are lost w/ the jalepeno alioi.  However it is so freakin' tasty, who cares!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is really nice. I like all the taps on the wall and the low lighting inside. They have a good selection of beers. We got the moules frites and the calamari. The mussels and frites were not very good at all. The fries just seemed soggy and bland. The mussels were just ok. And there was bacon on it which I expected to be some sort of bacon bits but it was a couple strips of bacon laid over top which seemed random. The calamari was pretty good. I would like if they expanded their menu somewhat."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, excellent food and a dog friendly patio. What more could you ask for?
Pizza is always good. Also had a pretzel appetizer that was very good, although it's pretty hard to screw up a pretzel. Calamari was good if you like a little Asian zing to you calamari. This particular dish was not heavily breaded at all, and that's a good thing. Friendly and attentive staff and a quaint and comfortable patio. One of my favorite spots near the great city of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my entire experience at Tremont Tap House!  We \"called ahead\" the night before (as they don't technically take reservations) since we had a bigger group going to dinner.  The moment we arrived, we were lead to a table upstairs, the whole time thinking that we had not realized how big the space was!  We were seated in front of a little fire place and had a large chunk of the room to ourselves which was nice.

The beer menus came next and were almost overwhelming!  There are so many beers I couldn't even begin to understand how the waiters and bartenders keep them all straight, and there was definitely something for everyone on the beer menu!  

The food menu followed suit and it was difficult to pick from the variety of yummy-sounding things!  I opted for the burger with bacon and egg... It certainly did not disappoint!  It was tender and juicy and perfectly cooked... Just thinking about it to write this review makes my mouth water!  the fries were very nicely seasoned and I completely cleaned my plate.  Everyone else in the group cleaned their plates too!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch & found a seat at the bar right away. Love the unique take on mimosas - cider instead of champagne. They are mostly cider with a splash of orange juice. 

For brunch, I had the Croque Madame & my date had the chorizo breakfast burrito. They were both full of flavor & calories! The Croque Madame came with a bechamel sauce that was slightly overwhelming. They could have put less of the sauce on top & I would have liked it a bit more. The potatoes on the side were awesome! 

Atmosphere is cool, people are relaxed - a great spot for a boozy brunch!"}
{"text":"It's Saturday afternoon, and I'm looking for a place to have lunch in Tremont. I found this place and it was packed but luckily we were able to get a table right away. 

Courtney greeted us at the door and pretty much checked on us pretty often. YOU ROCK COURTNEY! My friend and I ordered the house burger to split and the wild mushroom pizza (the pizza made me drool based on other photos Yelpers posted). 

Food came about 15 minutes later, they were kind enough and split our burger  and fries portion in half on separate plates before we even got it-- how awesome is that??? Made things easier. The food was just amazing. The burger was up there for best burger I've ever had, and as of today it's the best I've had in Cleveland. The pizza was flavorful and kept me wanting more. I actually just ate the last two slices for dinner before writing this review. 

Prices are fair and they have a lot of beer options for those interested. Atmosphere is great, a lot of locals who seem to know each other there. Staff is wonderfully pleasant and I will be back for sure, maybe tomorrow! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood bars. I live in Tremont and started coming to this bar when the owners first moved in and it was called the \"Starkweather\". The owners have done a wonderful job taking an old timers neighborhood spot into a hot spot. The building had a complete rehab and the patio is awesome. They even allow dogs in the patio area on Tuesday's during the summer for Yappy Hour nights!

The staff is ever changing  - but the mangers and bar staff seem to be solid. I always get great service from Christian, Dario and co-owner Chris. I am a fan of a burger and the Taphouse has one of the best in Cleveland. They are big, juicy and served with awesome hand-cut french fries. Be careful how you order them cooked however - the tend to come undercooked from what you ask for. The turkey sandwich with avocado and jalapeno is to die for - perfectly toasted and dressed. Veggie friends you can also sub their burgers for a veggie burger and they have a handful of other vegetarian friendly meals. One of my favorites is the macaroni and cheese.

Great drinks too. I'm not much of a drinker and don't drink beer but this place has 24 beers on tap and offer tastings if you want to try before you buy. The restaurant tends to be very busy on Friday nights after work hours and seats are rarely available so expect to wait. If you want a quiet night try a Wednesday or late night Saturday. 

Brunch is also very good - I've been a couple of times and never had a problem with the food. Always fresh and hot and quick to arrive."}
{"text":"Like Paulius N., I never really put much thought into getting to the Taphouse. I've been ignoring it and I'm not sure why. I'd like to be there again though, like right now. 

An impressive place on ALL levels. 

They have a ridiculous assortment of craft brews on tap. As a beer lover, I was very excited and wanted to slap myself for overlooking this place for so long. 

I stopped in yesterday morning with some friends. Originally, I was only here for some Bloody Mary's but since Ohio has antiquated liquor laws (no liquor until 11 am)  we opted for the beer. I shared some biscuits and gravy with mah girl Louise. Wow, quite delicious. I loved the fried egg on top and thought it really added to the dish. The rest of the brunch offerings looked amazing. I'm going to have to come back ASAP for that breakfast pizza. 

Foolishly, I didn't look at the dinner menu but I hear it's also noteworthy. 

Service was super friendly, attentive, and fast. 

Ambiance? One of the coolest looking places around. Exposed brick and a solid concrete bar -- kickass really. 

So for the third time, I'll mention that I cannot WAIT to return."}
{"text":"The chorizo tacos was amazing the highlight of my meal actually coming from a person who is not a fan of goat cheese everything paired really well together. And the pierogies best I've ever  hands down"}
{"text":"Food is good; I had a GREAT burger. Beer selection. Of course is awesome. Probably a little pricier than merited but that's Tremont for you."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to host a large group of people to celebrate my birthday and through my research this place was said to be extremely accommodating and I have the same to say!  I had a group of 20 coming on a Friday night for dinner, and they were more than willing to make our group have a good time.  They gave us the entire back of the restaurant, ended up being divided into three tables but there was plenty of space for people to get up and talk to other tables as well as when others showed up later you didn't feel slammed. 

They had another option for private parties upstairs that can accommodate larger groups, but it involves a minimum that I wasn't sure I could hit, but if you need a place to celebrate definitely give them a call. 

In addition to all of that the food was delicious.  We split a variety of appetizers including the fries, calamari, and pork butt nachos.  Each and every one was delicious and could of sufficed as our meals.  I got a pizza, and some other people at the table order burgers, the Philly, and salads and all of us were impressed! I was so full so I barley ate any of mine, but it was thin and crispy. I order the white and added chicken and it was all fresh ingredients that didn't flood with grease  or interrupt a night full of drinking.  The burgers and Philly were huge sandwiches and served with fries which we had already indulged in.  

I want to go back and expand my variety on the menu, as it didn't seem that anyone would have desired a different order."}
{"text":"Great brunch.  Delicious breakfast pizza. Cool laid back atmosphere.  Plan on coming back whenever I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Excellent food, beer, and service. Everything we had was delicious and the staff was incredibly nice. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A super great bar in Tremont that has a small but unique menu that will not disappoint you. Their beer list is always fantastic as is the services they have outdoor and a second level of seating. They also have an excellent brunch on Sunday's that you should try at least once!  I love their events as well. Another definite must try!!"}
{"text":"Love this local gastropub!   The tap house carries a meticulous and extensive array of beer and serves absolutely amazing chow.  The atmosphere is great and there is a cozy outdoor patio that fills up pretty quickly for the tasty Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for brunch when I was in town visiting, and it was one of the best brunches I've had in a while. I had a hard time ordering because I wanted multiple things! Our waiter was super chill and really friendly, and to top it off, he allowed me to bring my dog into the patio to sit with me while I ate. Typically they only allow dogs on certain days, so they made an exception, which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"Great Grub! A little pricey, but that's what you pay for fresh quality. We also sampled some local brews, fantastic selection!"}
{"text":"This place is a great pub to go if you're a fan for microbreweries. They have a great selection of microbrews ranging from your ales, dark beers, IPAs, stouts, etc. The staff is very attentive and they really know their beers. So if you have a question on a specific beer you're looking for, they would tell you and even give you a sample. It's a laid back casual atmosphere so this is a great place to bring a group of friends and relax. 

As far as food goes, they have some unique selections as well. Miso Ramen and Mussels & Frittes are what caught my eye. My friend ordered their mussels and it was the bomb!. The meat of the mussel were huge and it had a buttery broth to it. Not too crazy about the bacon and fries though. Miso Ramen I have yet to try but I thought that was just a random entree they have on their menu. So I have to check that out next time I come by. Open bar area has chalk board counters and chalk so for those people who like to draw, this place is for you. This place also has my favorite stout on draft: Left Hand Milk Stout so this is the IT place to go in Tremont if you're looking for a good beer. 

Also heard in the summer that they have their patio open with the bar outside so that's pretty cool. So definitely coming back and looking to try their happy hour which is from 4-7 M-F."}
{"text":"Are you looking for great beers on tap, in a bottle, in a can? Movie nights on the patio by the bonfire? Great food? This place is what you are looking for. I may be bias since they sponsor my rowing team but the food is great and there are plenty of choices. If you sit at the bar you can entertain yourself with the chalk board bar. The patio has plenty of seating and is beautiful in the summer time. And everyone is friendly and helpful. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"If I lived around here, I'd probably stop by way too much. Huge beer selection, super helpful & knowledgable staff, and a great food menu to complement it all."}
{"text":"I've been to Tremont Taphouse on two separate occasions: once last November and again this past weekend. Both times were for lunch and drinks with friends.  In November, we sat at a large table inside and this weekend, we were able to enjoy the beautiful patio.  They have a nice, rotating selection of beers and a full bar.  Their menu is extensive, but unique - creative, fancy(ish) bar food.  I have had two of their sandwiches - the turkey club and the salmon BLT, and both came with fries.  Other people i was with ordered the burgers and salads; all of which were enjoyed.

On my most recent visit, we sat on the patio. It was a gorgeous summer evening and we had a pup with us, so it was the perfect setup.  I started with one of their seasonal beers- and had the salmon BLT.  Service was good, beer was cold and food was delicious.  I'd recommend if you're in the area! Super cute!"}
{"text":"Best Veggie Burger In Town!!! Loved the everything about that place, just a nice chill spot."}
{"text":"Great food! Love the grilled cheese and their brunch breakfast pizza."}
{"text":"Went with a large party for a private event. Ordered the blue cheese ribeye with a side of goat cheese gnocchi and calamari as an appetizer. Calamari was very good, the right amount of sweet, spicy crunch. The ribeye was below Applebee's quality at best. Really disappointing. Low quality cut of meat and seared with a blow torch on the top for cosmetics and to melt the cheese. Lastly, the goat cheese gnocchi was simply inedible. Very spongy, oily, and pungent which makes for bad all around. Will not return again as there is not much that I enjoyed other than the calamari."}
{"text":"While I am a little saddened that the Tap House isn't open for brunch more days of the week, my waistline should probably be grateful for that small fact alone.

I've been here several times already for breakfast and everything I have tried has been phenomenal....so good, in fact, that I have such a hard time deciding what to get on the menu!  I've tried the Breakfast pizza (sounds strange but really good, trust in Rachel B.!), the Eggs Benny, the Braised Beef Hash and the Biscuits and Gravy....which are the \"best in Cleveland\" according to our very able bartender Christian....and I am going to have to agree with him!

Great atmosphere, according to all my friends they have really good beer and it is good for groups (a few UYE have already taken place here at the last minute).  They take reservations on Sunday mornings too?  Bonus!

While I have not yet been here for something other than brunch, it is on my short list for when the weather gets better and they open up that beautiful patio."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. The Sunday brunch menu is always changing and always good. Had the chorizo burrito this time, great to pair with a coconut Porter. Huge portions, good food, laid back but attentive service. Definitely worth trying, can be busy but that's a good thing right?"}
{"text":"Love this place. We would come here at least twice a month when we lived in Lakewood. We have recently moved to chicago and make the sojourn at least one a month. 
The beer list is to notch, the food is even better. We love the crab Benedict and the chorizo burrito."}
{"text":"--4.5 stars--
Went here for dinner and was very impressed. I enjoyed the casual, laid-back atmosphere of the restaurant as well as the great drink selections. There were a number of things on the menu that I wanted to order but I settled on the lamb burger, which is an unfair way of putting it because the meal was great. Perfectly cooked and complemented by the jalapeno aioli.  Also had the oysters and the pan fried aged gouda, both of which left me wanting more. Great service, and although a bit pricy...I am definitely looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"OMG, the brunch menu...
Tried some Biscuits and Gravy with my gal Thelma. Some of the best I've ever had. The biscuits were perfect and the flavorful gravy was to die for. The fried egg on top is a nice touch. I look forward to trying the other offerings!"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path but absolutely amazing. Cool vibe and great patio. A large variety of beers on tap and in bottles. But most of all the food was amazing. The turkey club was outstanding. Jalapeño aioli, bacon, turkey and avocado on bread perfectly toasted. My husband had the green chili burger which was perfectly spicy and to die for. The fries were perfect. An easy five stars."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Tuesday night. For a small kitchen staff they put out a variety of food. I had the salmon BLT, all to order. Very good. My friends had the portabello pasta (veg) and the Irish the tacos. Various beer choices and mixed drinks. 
 I'm sure on the weekends this place gets crowded when the outside patios not open. But early in the week it was quite nice. And in the summers it's good"}
{"text":"this was one of the first places i came to in cleveland when i first moved here. i had heard lots of good things about it, the patio, the beer. i've been back here many a times, and while i can't say i'm in love with it, it does have its charm.
the patio area in the summer is the best. they string up some lights for when the sun sets and it's a nice atmosphere. it's relaxing, fun, all around a good time.
the draw back for me is the food. while the food is good, i always feel very limited. there's not a ton of options to begin with, and being vegetarian, that cuts out half the menu. i feel like a lot of the vegetarian options are basically super carb heavy. i'm always a sucker for a good mac and cheese which they have, and i have had them customize, say, a sandwich for me with extra vegetables. they are certainly generous with the butter and oils tho.
i just came here for brunch the other day and had a yummy omelet. i even finished all the potato hash even tho i'm normally not a huge fan of potatoes. ooh and their bloody mary, delicious, a bit much of the pepper for me tho so i'll have to ask for less next time.
all in all, on the list of regular visitations for an enjoying meal or beer."}
{"text":"This was my second Sunday breakfast brunch at the Tremont Tap House.

Both times I've found myself standing outside like a fool waiting for them to open at 10am.  Thankfully they've been able to seat as soon as they open.  

Beware, Ohio's Puritanical liquor control laws don't allow you to enjoy an adult beverage on Sunday until 11am, a real downer for a bar that's open for breakfast.

Our first server was quick to come over with drink orders and to put our breakfast order in.  Sadly, the menu had too many good offerings that I couldn't make an easy decision.  I ended up ordering the Eggs Benedict, prepared over medium, yet they arrived over easy.  They gave us ketchup for the home fries, but we had to ask for salt and pepper as they don't live at the table.

Our second server was good about getting adult beverages after 11am.

The food and service were good, but a bit overpriced.  $12 for eggs Benedict I'd expect at a hotel, but not here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been here before and enjoyed it, but this visit left much to be desired.  My wife order the \"shrimp and grits\" and I had the \"Taphouse Philly.\"  My wife's meal was laughable, at best.  The chef desperately needs to make a trip down south for some re-education on grits.  The dish consisted of a large plate with breaded shrimp sitting on top of a very thin drizzle of grits with cream and mushrooms.  The dish was served with a \"summer vegetable medley\" which was some spinach leaves and paper thin radish slices.  My sandwich was an insult to the institution of Philly cheesesteaks!  I've had much better.  The only redeeming quality was the bleu cheese / buttermilk wiz.

To top off the horrible experience, I ordered a Belgian Tripel, served in a .25L stem.  The beverage was delivered with about 2\" of head.  After allowing it to settle, I requested to have the rest of the order.  The server laughed and said, \"that's how we serve them.\"  Ha!  I will not be back.

We used a $30 Groupon for this meal and our remaining bill was $33.  So I would have paid $63 for this miserable experience had I not had a Groupon."}
{"text":"I moved to tremont five months ago and I can not get enough of this restaurant. The food is unbelievable and the service is remarkable. I have ordered take out here and It was very timely. 
When I have eaten dine-in, most of the time the wait to get your food is longer than average. It seems as though the kitchen is not the best at keeping up with crowds. Regardless of the time It takes the food is always perfect."}
{"text":"If I was just rating the beer list, this place would get 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I went for brunch before a long drive back to my home state so I was sorely tempted by the giant beer list (I did have a very small, delicious beer).

I was here for the food and the food was fine.  My biscuits and gravy may well be the best in Cleveland, but that may not be saying much.  I mean, they were tasty, smoky, salty, gravy-y.  All those things.  But they appeared to be missing the fried sage I was promised.  The boyfriend's hangar steak and eggs also seemed to be missing a component--the yummy sounding sauce promised on the menu.  His meal was serviceable, too, not mind-blowing but tasty.  At least our bellies were full for the long drive."}
{"text":"good ass burgers

{"text":"this is a cumulative review...for i don't frequent taphouse as much as i used to.

first and foremost, the bartenders are probably the coolest, most down-to-earth folks that may work in a bar in cleveland.  they are knowledgable, friendly, and will tell you what you need to know, no bs or filter.  this is massively appreciated by myself.

inside, well, i'd say it's pretty basic.  but there's no pretensing here.  cop a squat at the bar, or the booths, or the tables if you get a chance, and get into that beer list or the menu.

the house burger with an egg is my preferred choice.  during the summer they employed a tangerine-tasting light beer which was simply amazing.

outside, i love the corner location, however, parking is very aggravating.  if you can't find a spot on scranton, try to squeeze your way behind and in the dirt lot."}
{"text":"This place has my favorite pizzas and my sister's my favorite seafood and fries.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"So, go ahead.  Make fun of the old guy, who never makes it to the great places until there have been a billionty-seven reviews and all the cool kids have moved on to that new place that serves placenta polenta, or whatever.  I'm old.  I can take it.

Took three generations of foodies out to brunch this morning, promising to try a new place.  The Tap sits on the corner of Scranton and, as my GPS Gal pronounced it, \"Stark Weether.\"  Parking in the back.  Jammed out on the patio, but we got a booth in the loud-ish area next to the bar.  I really needed some iced tea.  Uh-oh.  Only available in bottles.  So much for my bottomless thirst for my caffeine of choice.  (Although the bottle of corporate Republic of Teas was pretty effin' tasty.  Must admit.)

Oysters?  Well, yeah.  We'll take a dozen to start but, uh, what's the (as quoted) price?  Uh-oh.  Three bucks per.  Well, no.

Here's the four dishes that they got spectacularly right:

Two chorizo/pepper/other great stuff omelettes.
One blueberry pancakes with the obligatory pecan ice cream.
One breakfast pizza, drizzled with Hollandaise.  

The missing fifth star is because, even though the rest of the inside seating area was already nearly deserted, the food took forty-five minutes.  Three people apologized, but that's a whole heck of a long wait for four items with no changes or substitutions.  AND, the folks at the next booth arrived, ordered and were served, just in the time we waited and waited.  Ah, well.  These things happen.  We had nowhere else to go.  I gazed longingly at the wall o' beers on tap, lusted after the mixed beer list, watched the Tribe prepare to lose their seventh straight...  Wait'll NEXT year, baby!

{"text":"The Sunday brunch is awesome. Oysters and sausage yummy.  Fun atmosphere the staff is busy but fun and out going. They were real busy. They were out of some key drinks for Mango Bellini but all good. On the little more pricey side for being Gastro Pub still good food great people."}
{"text":"Almost without fail the first question I ask when deciding on where to spend my dining dollars is \"How's the beer list?\" And it's not just about length, either. I'm talking an intelligently designed and well thought out mix of brews that works in concert with the menu offerings. Tremont Tap House manages all of the above and more.

Tucked away on a corner of Scranton Road in Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood (who knew?) the Tremont Tap House is a wonderful addition to the Cleveland dining and beverage scene. In what I can only describe as an homage to beer and the relatively new art of food/beer pairing, this place has found an unmet need in our fair city and filled it to overflowing. 

First things first, the beer. It's clear that the folks at theTremont Tap House worship the stuff and I love it. It starts out with a beer list that has it all - a well-rounded grouping of bottles that's organized by style along with a bevy of useful information (ABV %, brewery, location) and a regularly updated 24-tap draft list featuring a selection of brews that range from the craft brew noob friendly Great Lakes Wright Pils to the palette punching Breckenridge 471 imperial IPA. If you're going to bill yourself as a gastropub you'd better be prepared to walk the walk. No worries here. 

The menu is just as good. A hefty selection of small plates (perfect for noshing with a $10/4-beer sampler) along with burgers, pizza, sandwiches and hearty entrées make it the perfect companion to a night of malt worship. On the eve of our visit we took a seat outside on the airy patio and proceeded to stuff our guts:

German pretzel app ($7.50) - This was the only major disappointment of the meal. I love soft pretzels with my beer and I love them even more when they're done right. A good soft pretzel should be nice and crispy on the outside and soft and doughy on the inside. This one was more like very dry bread than a pretzel. Good thing there was a tasty stout and smoked cheddar dipping sauce to help lube its way down.

Braised pork shank soft taco special ($18) - There's just something about seeing a giant piece of meat setting on a slab of wood with charred bones sticking out that makes me want to grunt and dive right in. Served with all the fixins (pickled onions, shredded cabbage, salsa verde, cilantro and warm flour tortillas) think of this one as a do-it-yourself carnitas. The pork was tender and juicy, the veg was crunchy and fresh and the fingers were perfectly greasy afterward.

Chorizo tacos small plate ($10) - As trio of crispy tacos packed with as much flavor as a Quinceañera dinner. The spicy chorizo, balanced well by the cooling goat cheese crumbles and green onions, went perfectly with the charred and diced red pepper salsa. I could have eaten two orders.

Just a small note on the service; it was pretty laid back and no frills. Don't come here expecting to be coddled through the dining process by some effete French nancy extolling the virtues of every last menu ingredient. For the most part I don't care about the name of the farm that made the goat cheese or the fact that the pig I'm about to eat was raised on a diet of Sprite and Nutella. This place is as straightforward as you can get with a team of tatted and industry-worn professionals that will get you what you want without the unnecessary fanfare and overly friendly pomp.  Some may call it rude or curt. I call it Cleveland.

So what could make coming home after four years of being out of state even better? How about coming home to find out that Cleveland finally has its first gastropub and that they managed to not only be first but to be great right along with it. If you're looking for some delicious upscale pub grub and a beer list that can hold its own against any in the state, get your butt into one of their seats...right...now."}
{"text":"Chorizo tacos are the best! Perogies are very good! Phenomenal beer list on tap. Happy hour anywhere in the bar, upstairs, or outside on the patio! Philly steak sandwich is average. Get the tacos!"}
{"text":"This was a great stop during my Cleveland bar hop. 

It has that laid back, welcoming vibe of a dive bar - but the aesthetics of a really nice bar.  The bar top also is made of chalk so you can make little doodles as you drink your tasty beverages. 

Our bartender was great - and so were the patrons - everyone was just super nice and chill.  We chatted with an older couple who were regulars who gave us the run down of some of their favorite beer cocktails, yes beer cocktails.  And they were SO GOOD. I had one with Gin, St Germain, IPA, Pineapple and basil.  Uuuuumm yeahhhh.

If you don't want one fancy concoctions, they  have a great selection of craft beers as well. 

This part of Cleveland certainly rocked."}
{"text":"We needed to get out of the house the day after Thanksgiving so we decided to go out to dinner and somehow landed on Tremont Tap House. They have parking in the back which is a win for the area.

The service was great and our waitress was very helpful in picking something on tap... there were almost too many choices.

What I like the most was how they make comfort foods a little more upscale and seasonal. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in Cleveland... I can get an awesome grilled cheese without dealing with a line like the one at Melt."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here semi-frequently for almost two years now and our worst experience was caused by a Browns game on a Sunday which meant we couldn't sit in our booth (ha!). The service was amazing (as per usual) and the brunch menu made a single decision seem impossible. On any other day you're looking at beer menu that never runs out and a food menu that leaves you feeling satisfied! If you're looking for a place that feels like a laid back, I-could-become-a-regular-here style scene then come here. And if you get Courtney as your waitress then feel #blessed."}
{"text":"Always impressed with Tremont Taphouse. Food is excellent and so is the food. The service is great and were very patient and polite with our kid and our friends kid who were both under two at the time."}
{"text":"Taphouse has large beer selection and pretty good food. Best perogies i have ever!!! They also have a Chirizo Pizza that is killer! Like most places in Tremont though it's crowded and everything is overpriced. So if your looking for a good place to eat in Tremont then this is a good choice but, if your on a budget you'd be better off avoiding Tremont all together."}
{"text":"It is a dilemma when the entire menu is enticing and everything that walks by looks great. The pork belly nachos tacos and duck poutine were a savory start. The service split our house burger with autumn veggie mac&cheese on separate plates. I was nice that we didnt have to do the cut and choose game. The samplers of beer were also a great way to get a taste of every local brew. Parking may be a little pain but it was worth it."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've had.  Service was absolutely horrible and it's hard for me to say having worked in a restaurant myself.  It was bad.  Food took overly long to come and service acted as if it was a bother for us to be there.  Bartenders were fun and helpful on beer selection."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch is a must try! We were up in Cleveland for the holidays and didn't feel like cooking for breakfast one morning so we stopped in. Many got the biscuits and gravy and said they were the best ever! I had the blueberry granola pancakes and they were phenomenal!!! I've never had anything like it. Something about the blueberry and granola together made this meal most delicious. I couldn't stop eating them! I also had a Bloody Mary, I'm usually a mimosa gal but this particular Bloody Mary was exceptional. I wish I lived closer to go back more frequently."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Best curated taps in the city, and ever single server knows beer.  Some a little too well, I suspect."}
{"text":"Beeeeer!!!

I really enjoyed my visit here. I came on a Friday evening at around 7:30, and we were seated upstairs. The upstairs is a lot quieter since it's not near the bar, so I think that the next time I come here I'll definitely sit either at the bar or at a table downstairs. We were seated immediately though, which was nice.

We tried both the moules-frites and the pan fried gouda, and both were delicious!! I really liked the cranberry onion marmalade that came with the gouda - they were perfect together. 

We got the green chili burger and the short rib. I could only manage a couple bites of my burger after the appetizers and beers, but it was cooked perfectly and I love the flavor of the peppers on the burger. It wasn't really spicy, but very flavorful. I tasted the short rib, which was also amazing - everything on that plate was delicious. Overall, the food (and beer) were great!

I feel like the main thing holding me back from five stars is that the atmosphere wasn't great - probably because we were sitting upstairs. I'm excited to come back, sit downstairs, eat some more amazing food, and explore that beer menu more!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and those pork belly nachos.  Pork belly nachos.  I can't get them out of my mind. I've probably had them 100 times now and I can't get enough.  Honestly, they are sometimes not made exactly as I like them. 

Sometimes the pork belly is overcooked.... 

When It's right it's oh so very right.  Succulent pork belly, habanero cheese sauce, picked onions.  This is what dreams of nacho perfection are made of.  Ask for extra chips you'll need them, at least I always do."}
{"text":"Food is great, I had the Chorizo Tacos with goat cheese, great idea! Great selection of beers. Service is great, 6 bartenders. Overall Great!!"}
{"text":"There's room for improvement for sure and it's definitely worth giving a second chance. The drink selection is good and the vibe is cool. The disappointment really lies in the food. I had the omelette with chorizo and cheese .. I thought it was supposed to come with peppers but I guess I was wrong. Or they didn't put peppers in it. If it's not supposed to come with peppers, it should!! The omelette was really bland and boring. The potatoes are good though! My friend had the burger with the egg and he said it was just ok. The house Bloody Mary mix is pretty ok .. it does have a kick to it!

I would try again. Definitely for drinks and hanging out. Hopefully the menu improves!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Ordered pierogis as an appetizer and a burger for dinner. Both were some of the best we've had! Awesome beer variety! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Tremont Taphouse last night. The decor and atmosphere were nice. The service was alittle below average for me. We picked up our own menus and waited about 5 minutes before the bartender came over to our table. They were moderately busy at the time and from what I observed there was 3 bartenders. Appetizer of calamari ($9) was standard and came out quick. We had to wait awhile to put in our entree orders and waited awhile to receive them. My boyfriend ordered the hangar steak ($17) and he said it was good. Cooked to temp he asked for as well. I ordered the free range chicken ($17). I thought it was good, but worth about $10-$12. I wasn't wowed. Overall, it was average to me. I'd probably go back for their happy hour."}
{"text":"What a great little place with a nice patio to sit outside (weather permitting, after all, this is Cleveland), a solid beer list, good service, and a great selection.  I had the salmon plate and my date had the salmon sandwich.  Both were great.  The beer tasting \"plank\" was great.

highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great selection of local beer on tap. I had the lamb burger and it was excellent. I skipped the fries and opted for the kale salad for my side and was not disappointed. Throw in some 90's alt music to top it off. I am definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Food took over an hour to get. The beer list is amazing but if you're planning on getting food. Don't. It take forever and a day."}
{"text":"People will tell you to go to Grumpy's for brunch, but they either like long lines or aren't a carnivore like I am.

All you need to know is that they have a chorizo burrito that's filled with goat cheese and glazed with hollandaise sauce. Everything on your plate starts melting together in one great conglomerate of meat, cheese, potatoes, and hollandaise. If you're not hungover from the night before, Tap House has an amazing beer selection. Hell, even if you are hungover you might as well to try to fight it off in the most proactive way possible.

You'll pay a slight premium price for the brunch, but if you like hearty brunches with numerous meat options then this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Love Love LOVE Tremont Taphouse! One of the best burgers we've ever had! Any of them - they are all good and consistently come out exactly how we order them. I've tried the oysters and the tacos before too, but always find my way back to one of their burgers. And their beer selection....let's just say go when the open, get a bar seat and call a cab to pick you up at midnight. FANTASTIC! Always have something fun and up-and-coming and the craft \"must-haves\"."}
{"text":"Large beer selection and great service. My salmon burger was cooked exactly the way I requested. Excellent comfort food."}
{"text":"Walk into TTH and you'll find a small, intimate restaurant.  The bar consumes easily half of the dining area, as to be expected when the name \"Tap House\" is glaring back at you ... but there is more than just good beer being served at this swanky establishment.  Suggested dishes on my \"must have\" list include: I Love Moule Frites, Joshua Burger, Seared Duck Breast, and ANY item that might be on a limited/special option.  (For example one visit I had the most amazing short rib dinner).  Two nights ago, on my most recent visit, I had my usual beer flight (the best way to sample the amazing selection of obscure and off-the-charts drafts TTH offers).  I wanted to try the Lamb Tagliatelle but they were all out, so I opted for the duck.  OMG, so glad I did!  Crispy, savory skin with tender duck meat -- I've tried duck at enough establishments in my 36+ years of life to say this was by far on the top 2 or 3 best ever duck dishes I've ever had.  For only $15 !!!  And with an amazing selection of beers to compliment, the TTH is a hidden gem in Cleveland.  I only hope it remains as casual and friendly -- the staff was attentive and helpful (the barkeep even put our beers in order of his suggested drinking order-- thanks!).  Can't wait to go back again... and again... and again!"}
{"text":"Beer snobs and food lovers rejoice! I spent my birthday here in early December and while I'd never been to the Tap House before, I loved it immediately. The beer list was of my dreams and the pizza and little eats we had were stellar. The service was friendly and attentive, too. I loved it, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I took a trip to Cleveland. We just left the zoo and were looking for somewhere to eat lunch. I read some reviews on this place and decided to check it out. We got some burgers. I got a the blue cheese burger. My mom got the regular one. She loved hers saying it was the best burger she had in a while. Mine was amazing. Even with the blue cheese and bacon you could still taste the beef. And there wasn't much seasoning, you can tell they know what they are doing here. 

The service was friendly and quick. He even poured out pomergrante ice tea for us. Upscale service in a casual place. 

I really recommend this place and would definetly come back when I'm in Cleveland"}
{"text":"When you come to a place and eat something you normally hate--and end up loving it, you know it's good. 

I don't like chorizo, or at least I didn't think I did. But then I came to Tremont TapHouse and got on their chorizo pizza. Holy-friggin-delicious. Just get it, you'll thank me later. Speaking of thanking me later... go ahead and try ANY of their burgers. ANY. You'll love them. 

I ordered takeout and they nailed it--who does that? No one gets takeout and really thinks it's as good as when you order it at the restaurant, fresh. BUT I ordered pierogies, 2 side salads and a salmon BLT for my man. Everything was ridiculously good even at home. I was worried that my bf's sammie would be weird by the time he got to eat it, but he scarfed it and then complimented it big time. He's very hard to please! My pierogies were served in a different container as the cheesy sauce so that they wouldn't get all weird on me either--so good. And the salads, although simple with fresh greens, shaved parm and homemade croutons, were divine. 

Take advantage of their happy hour, which is awesome. I think the food can get a little pricey, but trust me... you're getting so much delicious. it's worth it. 

Oh, and in the summertime, go patio or be sad forever."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant that's a little tucked away and looks small from the outside but is shockingly large on the inside. My group started with the German Pretzel, which was quite delicious, and then I had the house burger with white cheddar cheese, which was a pretty standard burger, though the white cheddar did kick it up a notch! I also had a house salad, which again was a pretty standard salad, except for the roasted red pepper vinaigrette, which was very tasty! The only real downside to me was that the seating wasn't very comfortable where we were. But overall, in terms of food, it's a great restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5. Good food but too far on the pricey side. There is usually decent beer on tap so that's a good way to add to your bill if you're eating."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Tremont taphouse for several years now. It is our go to stop for after dive refreshments and food. The taphouse consistently delivers high-quality food, exceptional service, and one of the most outstanding selections of microbrews in the Cleveland area. These folks know what they're doing and they are serious about service. Although I don't know any of the servers by name they are all excellent. The delightfully alluring young lady with the fair skin is superb and very attentive.

I am always quick to recommend the taphouse when asked for places to eat and drink in Cleveland. It will continue to be one of my favorites as long as they keep doing what they are doing.

{"text":"Great place for a craft beer and casual dining. They have a great selection of beers and a small menu of wines for those that don't drink beer. We grabbed a drink at the bar before getting our table for dinner. Seemed like our bartender did not know the beer list very well and could not offer recommendations on a type of wine when we asked. It wasn't a major problem but like...at least know the names of the beers you have available. 
Our waitress on the other hand was amazing. She gave us great recommendations, was attentive to our table and was able to take all our drink, app and dinner orders without having to write anything down (skillz). All of our entrees were so delicious! Their menu had all the regular gastropub-y things: mussels, poutine, big burgers... Not as creative as some other gastropub places I've been to but all very tasty anyways.
Will have to come back for happy hour next time and check out the outside patio!"}
{"text":"Pricey for sure...
Good beers and that is EXACTLY why you would want to do a happy hour there...
Had the chicken mozzy date pizza and I gotta say....
Not a fan of flat, hard dry alternative pizza....
Juust sayin'
I'm learning more and more about my palet or lack thereof!
HA!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, GREAT beer list, but very very bad service.  

They tell you to make a reservation, then they don't hold to it.  We had an 8:30 reservation and didn't get seated until 10:00.  The next time my 7:00 reservation turned into 9:30.  

Sadly though - even with the bad service, i'd go back again and again...and again...and again because the beer and food is so wonderful!  Great outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Breakfast Pizza was very good, service was friendly and atmosphere was pleasant (excluding the company that was with me).   Mimosas and beer were available even though hard liquor could not be served until 11a on Sundays due to horrible state law in Ohio."}
{"text":"Love the Tuesday yappy hours.  I've ate here plenty of times, but I have ordered the calamari pretty much every time.  It is the best calamari I have ever had.  The rest of the menu is decent.  I love the mac and cheese and their burgers are good.  The only problem I have ever had there has been with service.....sometimes it's great, sometimes the server appears very busy and sometimes the service is just plain bad."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I really can't remember ever having a bad experience! From mussels to fries to biscuits and gravy - all were very tasty! (Nice selection of beers as well!) Staff is friendly and I generally just like the laid-back/slightly hip vibe going on inside. I definitely need to come here more often!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place, wait staff if pleasant, observant, and cool.  Food is great.  Many vegetarian options!  Wish that it was in my neighborhood.  Beer selection awesome at decent prices too!"}
{"text":"Only reason this place is only getting 4/5 stars is cause the BF and I came 30 minutes before the kitchen opened, so I cant rate the food only the beer. 

As for the beer, great selection, little bit of something for everyone. Large list of IPAs, cause thats whats 'in' with craft beers right now. But there was also a nice list of other alternatives for those of us not into hoppy beers. BF and I both tried a Sour that we enjoyed. I wont name the maker cause the list constantly changes. But each beer listed had a nice descriptive statement attached. 

We'll have to come back at a time that the kitchen is open, so I can review the food too."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Cleveland to see a friend, she took me here for my first time for Sunday brunch before a Tribes game. They made me a custom made, not on the menu crab omelette, along with two very yummy bloody Marys. Outstanding! Sat at the bar, chatted with lovely people and had the best time.  After my brunch I highly recommend this little gem for any meal at any time."}
{"text":"The beer and food were great.  The Perogies coupled with a pint of Columbus Creeper made my evening! Give this place a chance, you'll be back."}
{"text":"Great and HUGE selection of beers.  The happy hour specials are also great.  4-7 and $1.50 off beers and $5.00 white pizza (which is one of the best things on the menu).  The food is always good and the happy hour crowds are lively.  They provide chalk and allow you to draw on the bar....silly but can be fun.  The patio is very cool in the summers and they also have movie night on a projection screen.  Very cool and very fun times here."}
{"text":"I finally made it here after hearing nothing but great reviews about it.  The beer selection is exactly what I had expected.  Calling it expansive is an understatement.  The service was perfect.  Very nice and personable bartenders and they also weren't afraid to give recommendations of the menu.  The food was excellent.  I had the Joshua burger, which I mainly got because it said a house sauce was on it.  I always get food with homemade elements.  It gives me a great idea of how any of the other food will be.  I will go back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. Was told the wait was a half hour, we got seated in ten minutes which was nice. Great beer list. We ordered the pan fried Gouda as an appetizer. Pretty good. For our dinners we got the Moule Frites which were tasty. Loved the broth. Also had the turkey club. The turkey was very flavorful. The fries that came with the club were a little soggy but for the most part everything we ate was delicious. Our server was very nice and attentive. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Four of us stopped by after work for a casual dinner at the Tremont Tap House.  Although not in the \"heart\" of the Tremont action, this place is well worth getting over to Scranton Road and having some of the best food in the neighborhood. Casual bar atmosphere with a row of booths and tall tables in the rear for dining. I had the Pork and Beans-don't let the name fool you. Absolutely delicious braised pork shank on a bed of cranberry-bacon beans. Great apps-the Calamari with chili seasoning was only topped by the Crispy Smoked Gouda plate. I'm going back soon. And oh yeah, they have lots of beer (I'm a whiskey drinker-so ho-hum couldn't care less)."}
{"text":"My wife and I are on a road trip from NY back home to CO. This was a gem that I found on Yelp! If you get there by 6 pm you can catch the happy hour deals. Food and service was on point, and when we travel we are on the look and review spots with great reviews. Get on in here/there."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Been here a few time so far, and I feel like each experience has been better than the last. The service is friendly and patient. When I asked for beer recommendations from their expansive draft list, the waitress went out of her way to tell me about what her favorites were, as well as their best sellers. 

The food is definitely the best part. I was lucky enough to order the Banh Mi right when they switched it over to pork belly. It was without a doubt the best Banh Mi I've ever had! I mean you can't go wrong with pork belly. Also, their burgers are BOMB. I got the Green Chile Burger last time I was there, and was blown away. 

The question isn't if I will be back there, the question is how soon can I go back?"}
{"text":"GREAT good and great beer!! This option needs to be accessible to everyone in Cleveland before choosing where to go! Unbelievable food! Been there dozens of times and have always left stuffed and super satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I just recently visited in very pleasant company..;)
They have a great selection of beer! I had a Belgian pale ale. Had their chorizo tacos which were good. The patio is highly recommended, nestled a little ways from the main tremont strip.
The Mac and cheese was very good and the salmon came highly recommend. The duck looked great as well but unfortunately they were out. 
The owner is very friendly, as is the rest of the staff. Oh! And they have a great place upstairs. They have seating overlooking the main street and a private area for birthdays and other celebrations. The private are is extremely comfortable and trendy with a long dining table with red leather chairs and an uber welcoming sofa sectional as well, all complete with a full screen. 
I would definitely go back! They have an amazing beer selection!! Cheers!
Also they do Monday night movies and have been told they do a great brunch!"}
{"text":"Love the Taphouse! Great beer selection and food is consistently good... one of our regulars when we lived in Cle!"}
{"text":"Had a great time for lunch. The wife and I took the puppies to edge water park for some fun in the sand and stopped on our way home.  Had some really great chorizo tacos and pork belly nachos. Both were Freaking Awesome!!  The draft beer selection is from the Butcher and the Brewer plus others like omegang and lagunitas.  Loved the IPA's Stop hop kaboom! And the Totes 'ma oats.  Both were very good.  My wife also liked her old fashioned.  The service was good. The patio was clean. We look forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, but only for a beer.  So lets talk about beer.  

Lots of IPA's.  At least 10 or 15 on draft. There are a tone of others also. Hence the Tap House!  Once you u understand the beer menu you will be golden. It rates the beer and tells you the % of alcohol.  The beers are not cheap keep that in mind if you are on any sort of budget

Chow!

I was there for a friend's  b-day. My feisty friends really know how to party.  Aside from excessive libations they ordered a bunch of food!  

Calamari-
The calamari  was excellent. It was not that out of the box crap served old school  with Ragu marinara sauce.  It  melted in my mouth.  It seemed like it was hand battered, but who knows!

Fish Tacos-
Super, done just right.  Fish tacos you either love them or hate. I'm not a hater.

Pot roast sandwich-
This was for sure some super late night I got the munchies sort of deal.  The fries were very good also.  Not sure it was worth like 12$ or something, but it was tasty.

The pizza-
The pizza was very nice, thin crust if I remember correctly. Kind of like the new way to do pizza in a gastro pub.  Its good but lets be real pizza ovens are 50% of the battle. So take it in stride this is not a pizzeria

The service-
The service was very efficient and friendly.  They were also easy on the eyes.  It seemed my feisty friends very much liked the service  : )"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. The Turkey Club and Mac & Cheese are to die for. I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Four score and seven plus years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Then i went to the tap house for breakfast on a Sunday. Opened up at 10 am. Had the eggs Benedict, over medium.  $12.00 for breakfast in a bar seemed over the top. After all it was 2 eggs' an English muffin and a cubed up potato. 
 The food was very tasty. No liquor sales before 11am. Bloody marry was a no go. However mimosas and beer we available.  I left at  11am and the place was almost packed. Either get there when they open or don't be in a hurry. 
In all, the Cost effected the over all rating. Friendly service, tasty food and quick enough service. 
P.S. the mimosa was $6.00 not too bad. Filled it to the rim!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to wonder if \"gastropub\" is just another synonym for \"overpriced.\"  Between this place and Deagans (the only other gastropub I've been to) I'm not really getting the appeal.  This was my first time here, and while our experience wasn't terrible, I don't see myself coming back on purpose.   

It's got \"Tap House\" in the title and on the surface, yes, the beer list looks impressive.  The problem is that they didn't actually have any of them.  There were several beers on the list that were stamped as being out of stock, so I tried to order not one, not two, but THREE different beers (that weren't marked as being gone) and all of them were out as well.  After thinking about implementing a \"three strikes and you're out\" policy and sticking with water, I finally just asked the server to tell me which ones they actually had, but he couldn't.  He also couldn't tell my friend what the seasonal vegetable was.  Or answer just about any other question we had.  I'm not a stickler for service so it wasn't a big deal, but they could stand to step their game up a bit.   

The only thing salvaging this review is the food.  It's really, really tasty, but it's also significantly overpriced.  Between the four of us, I got the turkey club, one of my friends got the mac & cheese, and another got a burger with a black bean patty instead of meat.  I'd be lying if I said my sandwich wasn't delicious.  Turkey, bacon and avocado are three of my all time favorite things ever, but for $12 I expect a bit more than two slices of bacon and two baby slivers of avocado.  They were so tiny I thought they actually forgot to put them on at first.  The fries were also delicious (and I'm a total snob when it comes to fries), but again, way too expensive for what was basically a turkey sandwich on toasted white bread.  We're talking Baker Square quality here (and I don't mean that as a bad thing... I'll throw down over some Baker Square).  My friend loved the mac & cheese but my other friend thought the burger was just okay, so all in all it was pretty much a wash.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was fantastic either.  The general consensus was that for the price it wasn't really worth it.    

If you're out before 8pm and just want a tasty dinner, I'd recommend hitting up happy hour at Lava Lounge.  The food is just as good and significantly cheaper.  If you're out after that and/or craving specialty beer this is definitely worth checking out, just be prepared that there's a good chance they won't actually have what you're looking for, even if it's on the menu and up on the wall.  

I see people in other reviews talking about long waits, and I don't mean this as harsh as it sounds, but there's nothing here worth waiting for that you can't get somewhere else.  

Bottom line: You could definitely do worse than the Tap House, but you could also do better for less money."}
{"text":"Decent food but way too pricy. I spent almost $50 on food and one drink per person for two."}
{"text":"My only complaint about their brunch is how popular it is! There was quite the wait on a Sunday morning, but upon tasting the food, I understand why.

I ordered the biscuits and gravy, which had a delicious blend of chorizo and crispy sage in the gravy -- all topped off with a fried egg. I left not a speck on my plate. Paired with a cider mimosa, it was a great way to kick off my morning!"}
{"text":"I was sober for almost four months as I worked on losing 30 lbs and a bunch of body fat.  When it was time to break bad (see what I did there), I went to the tap house.  Why? It's got all the beers, that's why!  The food is damn good too, but this place has all the beers.  

Actually, I came here a lot while I was being good and dieting too.  They took care of me even with my limited menu options and my inability to drink beer.  But that limitation aside, did I mention they have all the beers?

I love the brunch, personally.  The breakfast burrito is solid.  If you're like me and you can't needed to limit your grain intake, they'll plop all the filling into a bowl so you can have a great scramble.  The omelets are also solid.  And they have all the beers available for brunch service too.  All the beers.

Dinner-time works well too.  I was so happy to have the lamb papperdelle when I went off the diet reservation.  It's a great winter-time dish that meets the demands of my Italian blood's insatiable lust for pasta.  Sometimes I just like to pony up to the bar and get oysters with my drinks.  Since they have individual fresh oysters available, I'm in heaven when I'm there in-between meals.  And when I'm not dieting, and drinking is ok, oysters go well with all the beers.  All the beers.

Service isn't too shabby either.  Actually, it's really good.  Everyone here knows there stuff.  Which is kind of a must when you consider they have all the beers.  I love the Tap House."}
{"text":"Oh man, what I had was fantastic. The caesar salad was interesting, very good with a quail egg. Then I had a burger with blue cheese with the works. Awesome, cooked medium, super tasty. Nice evening, nice outdoor patio. Service was good."}
{"text":"The patio in the summer is awesome! Beer selection is on point. I got the house burger with mushrooms and it was delicious. My friends tried the other burgers on the menu and they love them! It's a great place to relax and hangout with some good friends!"}
{"text":"i have had this place bookmarked for awhile now and FINALLY i was able to try it out.

Let's just say i was very pleased and the reviews are totally on point. Cute little spot, yes very little. I imagine the wait on a fri or sat night can get very long with their lack of seating.

But i have been dying to try the mussels and fries and mm mm mmm! The broth that they were in was fantasic! Def a must- i had this as my meal but i would totally reccomend getting this for an app too!
My friend got the pork chop with apple bacon relish and man was it yummy! The flavors were an awesome combination!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Very good beer selection.. Is pet friendly... 
Lamb burger is a must
Have a outdoor patio where once a week they play movie also .. 
All in all of you are in Cleveland and don't know where to eat go here ...."}
{"text":"For the longest time, I didn't believe in brunch. It was either breakfast or lunch and day drinking was not part of my routine. Some time over the past year, the lines got blurred and now I'm a big advocate of mimosas before noon and eggs and bacon in the afternoon. More importantly, I am a HUGE advocate of brunch at Tremont Taphouse in particular. And here are the reasons:
-delicious sin-mosas made from original sin cider and orange juice
-the Croque Madame: Bavarian ham, Gouda, fried egg and bechamel sauce)
-if you liked breakfast burritos, it seems to be a fan favorite here
-casual, laid back atmosphere 
-superb beer selection
-dogs allowed on the patio
And that's just brunch. I haven't had dinner here yet, but I hear it's pretty fantastic!"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries were amazing!! We will definitely go back!! The only reason we gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the service was a little slow. A few of the workers were drinking more than they were working."}
{"text":"I was craving good bar food, so we decided to give them a try. It was a lot more than I was expecting to pay ($50 for two meals and two beers), but the food was great. 

I got the Banh Mi sandwich which was good. It had crusty bread, tender pork and fresh and picked veg. The freshness from the veg made it so good. I had to remove the jalapeño from the sandwich because the large slices were too much for me. But I'm weak when it comes to spice. 

The showstopper of the night was their Brussels Sprouts. Omg. They were incredible. I switched out my fries for them for an uncharge,  but totally with it. I got a big cup of these perfectly caramelized sprouts. With sweet onions that were super cooked down. And bacon! That all was in a sweet honey balsamic vinaigrette?  Or something. I want the recipe. 

My husband got a burger and fries, which was good.  But I didn't think it was anything extra special. 

The mood of the restaurant was casual. There were a bunch of regulars talking about how long they have been coming- literally years. 

I will be back for more Brussels Sprouts... and maybe their Brussels Sprouts pizza. Mmm."}
{"text":"I really like this place... The reason for only 3 out of 5 stars is because I ordered the salmon BLT.  They bring the sandwich cut in half.  As soon as I looked at it you can see how raw and under cooked it was in the center.  I mean, come on! U cut the sandwich, u should take a peek at it to make sure it's properly cooked before u serve it! 
I ordered it w/a side salad, that was a $3 up charge.  Not worth it!   I also asked for the dressing on the side which she said she could do, but it came on the salad anyway! I didn't even bother to say anything.  The salmon was taken back to finish cooking and in the end it was just an ok sandwich. 

The steak came very rare and it was supposed to be medium.  But the person I was with liked it once it came back cooked right.

The chorizzo pizza was very tasty! 
The duck gravy fries appetizer was delicious too!"}
{"text":"I was a little surprised this joint was jammed on a freakin' Thursday night! That is a good sign though, and decided to wait it out for a table.

I was not disappointed with my wait. I had a delicious 'blue burger' with fries made absolutely perfectly. 

It was going to be an early day for me the next day so I had to watch how many I had. Tremont has a beautiful idea with their samplers, considering there are about a 130 beers to chose from. I was able to taste 4 amazing beers at 2.5oz each of different styles and strengths and it equaled out to less than one pint. Normally I would like to try them by the pint but in this exception, that kept me legal and able to get to it the next day. 

The layout is rustic brick inside with an amazing outdoor patio. An innovative layout allows access from the outside patio to the indoor bar through a window cutout directly  behind the taps at the bar. The barkeep just passes you the beer through the window. The tables all had interesting artwork painted on them and lacquered over.

Service here is brisk but friendly. 

Cleveland has some cool gastropubs!"}
{"text":"Tremont Taphouse is a nice place for casual beers or sit down for dinner. Good selection of drafts and imported bottles. 

I was visiting with a group of 4. Everyone enjoyed their food - original burger, chili burger with jalapeño aioli, hanger steak sandwich, and mussels as a special which were cooked with a standard broth but then it had chunks of bacon and bleu cheese added and was very good, a bit strong. 

Service was good, especially considering how busy they were inside and outside in the patio area. 

Would definitely return to try some of the other entrees and beers!"}
{"text":"Been to Tap House a few times (twice for brunch and twice for drinks).  I haven't been for lunch/dinner, so I can't comment on how that is, but they have a great selection of beers and my favorite part about this place has got to be the Sunday brunch. 

I usually sit outside on the patio which is really nice on a sunny day.  If you go around brunch time (11-1pm), there may be a wait for a patio table.  We went at 1:30 and there was no problem getting a table outside (and brunch is served until 3).  For food, I highly recommend the CHORIZO BURRITO!  It's a huge portion and it's sooo tasty! It's filled with egg, chorizo, roasted red peppers, goat cheese, and smothered with hollandaise.  I thought it sounded good but it more than exceeded my expectations.  My friend got it this last time we went and she also loved it.  Another friend tried the Breakfast Pizza which she said was good.  I've also tried the Beef Hash which was a different take on corned beef and hash but I really liked it.  It had a good mix of flavors and textures.  Also recommend getting a mimosa if you're in the mood (FYI it's made with cider instead of champagne).  Only thing is be careful if you come to brunch early as they can't serve you any alcohol until 11am."}
{"text":"really good burger, cooked just how i wanted it with great toppings. the green chiles on my burger were great, not spicy, but added good flavor. good beer list with a lot of variety of styles on tap, and many season drinks which is great in fall with oktoberfest and pumpkin season going on."}
{"text":"Stopped for brunch today service was terrible and the food was served cold asked for toast and got warm bread for $2  won't be going back"}
{"text":"We had a really great time here on our visit to Cleveland. We went solely for the beer, but had great pizza too. The place was packed so we just sat at the bar. You can't beat the beer selection and the place has a cool vibe."}
{"text":"I've been to TT about 40 times and every single time the food is the same....that is to say, expertly done.  The Green Chili burger is the best in Cleveland and when you ask for it cooked medium, it's cooked medium.  Right temps, great food, friendly staff and layer on about 40 rotating drafts with the omnipresent Belgian; how can you go wrong?!?"}
{"text":"Say you knew it first -- your friends will thank you.  And think you're totally cool.

I'll be honest - I'm a snob when it comes to food, drink and atmosphere and to be sure, the Cleve has some good places to dine but if I had to pick one that captured the best of the essence of the Cleve -- great food and beers at a casual eatery (that both your unemployed buddy and your ibanker friend can enjoy) the Tremont Tap House Takes the Cake.

First and foremost, the Tap House lives up to its namesake.  Their beer list is not the most extensive in town, but it is one of the most complete -- MAD props for having the Dogfish Head Red & White for a brief moment in time -- and deep beer lists you'll find.  However, fear not!  The staff which is quite friendly is passionate about beer; they are well versed on the styles as well as their specific offerings and are more than happy to guide you on your imbibing journey.  I often frequent the Tap House simply to try their newest offerings - because I'm a nerd.  If you're not a beer nerd and are unsure as to what to order they will more than happily provide a tasting from their extensive draft list.

But, even if you don't drink, you should still go to the Tap House (despite its namesake), because they have some of the BEST food in Cleveland.  I DARE you to find a better burger within 50 miles of Tower City.  You won't.  The mushroom burger will blow your mind.  If you're into beef eat the short rib (either the sliders or the entree), I'm sure my first words were \"Its Perfect.\"  The scallops and pork chop are off the chain good and for godsakes, order the melted spinach.  There is a reason your mom told you to eat your veggies.  This is it.  Eat a pretzel, eat an empanada eat a pizza eat whatever gets you atwitter -- its all very good and lives up to the \"gastropub\" vision.  

As for the atmosphere, the bar itself while on the smaller side, is very well done.  Cozy booths and Table Tops are available for larger groups while the bar itself has a quintessential Cleveland feel -- heavy wood bar with comfy bar stools and several high quality TVs for your Cleveland Sports (dis)pleasure.  Personally, I'm in love with the patio.  Its a perfect celebration of food, drink and four months of great weather.  

In summary, I know I totally just fawned over this joint, but seriously, find it, drink it, eat it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood bar and restaurant, the banh mi sandwich is my newest addiction!"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I had a fantastic meal!  It was my first time ordering more than beer there.  The turkey club, brussels, and mac and cheese were delicious.  My husband said his burger was perfect.  I was surprised to find such quality at what I thought was just a bar.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  I was craving a vodka martini and the bartender nailed that too.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at the bar on Friday. Our waitress screwed up our order. We paid with a gift card. The waitress took the liberty of tipping herself 20% on the gift card. Lied and said we had $10 left of a $50 gift card. My guess she is she thought we wouldn't tip. Well we did, 20% percent. Good thing the food was good. Tip: don't use a gift card."}
{"text":"When I walked in the smell was off-putting. Had really bad service here. Came here with my bf and got the beer flight. Then waited 40 minutes for mussels as our server disappeared. Then we weren't sure if we got a new server since he sat down at the bar with beer n went through his social media. Overpriced food for low to medium quality. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer person, but the friend I went to the Tap House with is, and she thought the beer selection was great. 

In terms of food, we both had burgers (I had the house burger and she had the Joshua) and we both decided that they were too salty. I'm not sure if the bun, which was kind of soggy, had salt on it or if there was a layer of salt coating the bottom of the patty, but it was too much for me. 

The Tap House had a nice vibe, so I'd definitely go back to try out more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"We came here for my boyfriends birthday. It was a gorgeous night so the patio garage doors were open. I love that you can feel outside while still sitting inside! 
The beer selection was great, the service was good, the atmosphere is great and the food was outstanding. We shared the pork belly nachos which were delicious. I had the pan seared chicken which was sooooo good! Cooked just right and the sauce it was in was amazing! Everyone else had burgers or pizza and loved it all!"}
{"text":"There are some food & drink establishments that strive for greatness and fall short. There are others who are overzealous and underwhelm. The restaurant bizz is a tough one to survive in with tons of overhead and a fickle market to cater to. If I were a proprietor in food service, I would go down fighting. I'd wear my heart on my sleeve. At least that way, I can take pride in saying \"I did it my way\". My success would hinge on trusting the public to support the ideas and love behind my creations. In a land where taking the easy way out is rewarded too often, I appreciate restaurants that take chances instead of just settling for another mindless, familiar, touristy TGI McFunster clone. 

You see, TGI McFunsters and the alike type establishments would be easy. It's like suckling from the teet of welfare your entire life. Where's the fulfillment in that? There's no pride in running a restaurant that serves the same food and drink and has the same schwag on the walls as every other soul destroying chain on this planet. At the end of the day, it may be a decent living. The place may even be a raging success. Hell, there ARE a lot of unadventurous people that actually enjoy TGI McFunsters! But at the beginning of each morning, when you look at yourself in the mirror, do you get satisfaction in uninspiring sameness? Conversely, could you imagine how rewarding it would be to create and innovate instead? 

Without further ado, it should go without saying that Tremont Tap House is far from another TGI McFunster clone. What they do bring to the restaurant/bar scene is innovative and exciting. I realize gastropubs aren't exactly new to Cleveland. They're actually becoming quite popular as of recent, but Tremont Tap House is said to be the first in the area. Their early success has seemed to inspire others to clone them.

Tremont Tap house is a relaxed watering hole first and foremost as the name suggests. Dim lighting, high ceilings, a solid concrete bar top and large wooden booths adjacent to the bar create the space. Then there's probably one of the most impressive lineups of draft beer tap handles I have ever seen. 48 craft beers on draft. Even more in bottled form. I can drink bottles at home, so whenever I go out, I opt for the drafts. Unless I'm unimpressed, bottles are typically a last resort. Tremont Tap House has an impressive beer menu along with vivid flavour descriptions below each brew. If hop-heads could see the beer list, celestial trumpets would sound to symbolize the giddy excitement that would surely follow. 

A recent trip brought us here for their famous Sunday Brunch. Despite being a menu of what appeared to be above average pub-grub, it all seemed approachable yet creative, exciting yet unpretentious.  After much debate I ordered the Braised Beef Hash with pablano peppers, onions, fried egg, crispy tortillas, smoked cheddar and salsa. My accomplice, the \"best biscuits and gravy in all of Cleveland\" as recommended by the bartender. Lofty expectations abound, the meal didn't disappoint. Both dishes well flavored and exceptionally done. 

The fusion of good food and good drink isn't new, it's a growing trend, but Tremont Tap House was one of the first to bring this exciting movement to Cleveland and for that they deserve much credit."}
{"text":"Burgers were so delicious! And the mac n cheese is OMG good. I had the green chili burger and my husband had the lamb burger. The lamb was good but with a doubt the green chili burger was tastier. My husband who loves eating lamb preferred my sandwich over his, as well. The fries were alright, could be better. 

Service was alright- at one point I got up and went to ask the bartender to refill my diet coke because our waiter was taking too long to come back. The music there is really loud on Saturday night...which was kinda annoying. But I get it, it's a bar and it's Saturday night, so. 

Would def go back for the burgers again."}
{"text":"This place is a must anytime we are in the Cleveland area.  Best brunch and beer selection.  Cannot say enough about it.  Don't think about, just go!"}
{"text":"We arrived to the Tremont Tap House which I was excited to find it is really a semi upscale gastro pub. I loved the look and feel of the place from the exposed brick, dark wood, tin ceilings and massive beer bottle wall, full bar and a LONG line of taps! 

Very trendy and busy on Friday night! The hostess was so friendly even though she was slammed, she seemed to go above and beyond in keeping us posted about our status on a open dining table. While we waited we stood by the crowded bar and enjoyed some small beers that you can buy for $2.50, what a novel idea to try the various beers before deciding on one! 

The beer selection is great really something for everyone and every price range from $4.00 to $16.00 a pint from a selection of Ales, Pilsner, Ambers, Stouts, Porters, Belgians, and more.. I really enjoyed the Great Lakes Brewing beers I tried the best. I am so glad we had a great hostess whom by the end of the night we had more contact with than our waitress. I wish the tip could have gone to her.. Bummer that our waitress was so smug, grouchy and just not 'there'. I can respect the busy but not the mean.. I tried to ignore her so she would not ruin my total experience. Shame cause was about to be a super 5+ review. (we were missing half of the bun for the burger but we had to flag her since she did not check on us, then forgot condiments 2 times so food was getting cold that I would use it on.. Duh, Empty drink.. she just not there.)
Our food was delicious and cooked perfectly once we had everything, we really enjoyed the dinner. The horseradish mustard was the bomb condiment as was the alioli dipping sauce for your frites, you must try those! I really can't wait to return if I travel back out that way again. I bet that patio is sweet in the summer too! Cleveland DOES Rock! ;)

Tip: I noticed upstairs they have a really great private dining room for special parties it looked like it could fit a good sized group."}
{"text":"I was out watching a Tribe game with my extended family on memorial day weekend, and we wanted to stop for dinner before heading back South.  My brother wanted to go to a brew pub, my aunt wanted to go to a sports bar, and some others wanted to go to something called 'bahama mama'.  

And then Yelp! came to the rescue - Tremont Tap House was flagged as one of the best restaurants within 5 miles of Progressive Field, so we decided to give it a go.  Nestled in the quiet neighborhood of Tremont just across the river, it's close to Cleveland without being part of the city bustle.  

The Tap House has a bevy of exceptional beers on draught, with an even larger bottle list.  The constantly rotating draught list carried east and west coast beers and even a nice German Kölsch.  Equally exceptional was the food.  The menu was fitting for a gastro-pub.  We had appetizers of fried gouda cheese with cranberries (amazing!) and pork belly nachos.  All menu items had a bit of a posh twist, whether it was that the grilled cheese was made with boursin and four other cheeses, or if the pork and beans was actually cider braised pork shank and cranberry beans.  Not a meal amongst the 10 of us was left unfinished, we had a universally positive experience.

The staff was friendly and skillful.  The atmosphere was pleasant.  For me, the Tremont Tap House is the ideal gastropub."}
{"text":"Warm weather in Cleveland means booking it to the patio at Tremont Tap House.

I no longer live in Cleveland, but if I did, I'd be over here as often as possible, drinking delicious draft beer to wash down their incredibly light and crispy calamari. Best calamari I've ever had."}
{"text":"This was a fun spot for a Saturday afternoon lunch. The bar was pretty full so we grabbed a booth. The draft selection is impressive, including the house brews (Butcher & Brewer). We ordered the house brew kolsch and farmhouse ales (I loved the farmhouse ale!). They also have a rotating daily $4 brew. 

We shared some small plates for lunch, including the calamari (based on a review on here), poutine, and pierogi. All of which were delicious and more food than i needed for lunch. A very cool atmosphere and friendly staff. They had easy parking and what looks like a nice patio; we'll be back in the warm weather!"}
{"text":"the number of stars i've given does not reflect the quality of beer or food or service but rather the people that i came in contact with at the tremont tap house. a group of people like to frequent this place on sundays. what they did was drink heavily and cause a scene. i actually approached the group to ask them simply \"not to scream\" and one of the guys told me he was capable of settling himself. i assure you this man-baby is incapable of self control. he later went ahead and called me a number of pretty foul names that i happened to catch since he still lacked the capacity of controlling his voice. 

HOWEVER, 

They have an awesome rotating beer list and my burger was pretty good. The server was super nice and apologized several times for the unruly group of people.

Go there for the beer but if you go on a sunday be prepared to deal with drunk goons at the end of the bar."}
{"text":"Hell damn ass yes. I love this place and have pretty much never had something not delicious here. Their beer selection is one of the best in town, and their (limited) menu keeps calling me back for delicious burgers and moules frites. Their \"small plates\" are good for those of you couples out there, but bachelors like myself will be sitting in the corner eating an entire pizza by ourselves."}
{"text":"From Los Angeles, but was in Cleveland on business. I'm a bit of a foodie-snob wannabe, and I thought the Tap House was AMAZING. Great beer selection, and the food was excellent. Every dish had a unique spin put on it - highly, highly recommended. We sat at the bar, but the outside patio area is nice too. Also plenty of TVs for sports."}
{"text":"In a recent interview I read about Sam McNulty (who owns breweries himself) he said his favorite beer is the hoppy pub-exclusive beers at Great Lakes.  Its good to see a local guy support LOCAL breweries and know where his bread is buttered.  Not much can be said about a whole crop of new beer-focused pubs.  Tap House, Beer Engine, Prosperity, etc..all have great beer lists but severely lack when it comes to the big boys on the block.  Beer dinners paired with Dogfish, Bells, etc are the norm and Conways, Nosferatu and Edmund Fitzgerald all get looked over.  Other, bigger cities love to support their local brews and have embraced outsiders while keeping true to their hometown roots.  Menus push local mushrooms, local greens...yada, yada, yada.  How about a brew made less than a mile away and probably a beer that ya drank years before ya even knew about the Omegangs or Sam Smiths of the beer world?  A beer that is made by a place that employs 100 Clevelanders that most likely support YOU?!  So anyway, this place serves its purpose for the wana be hip suburbanites who come to Tremont and party down Friday and Saturday nights.  Just drive down Scranton and watch em walk right out in front of you, crossing the street...like they rightfully own the place.  I guess, now they do.  I guess I just miss Trinkas when I could walk in and there were 5 regulars and Jack would pour me a Genny on draft.  So, how long till there is valet parking on Scranton???"}
{"text":"It was my first time here, although the friends who I went with had all been there before. There was a wait of about 30 minutes so we sat at the bar while we waited for our table. 

They had a ton of beers on draft (which was to be expected) so it was nice to be able to try some new flavors. We were then seated upstairs and ordered. We got oysters as an appetizer, which were really great. I then got my green chile burger, which was so good and a lot better than I thought it would be. Definitely a fun place to go with some friends for some good food and to unwind after a stressful day at work."}
{"text":"Cleveland needs more bars like Tremont Tap House.

The food is excellent.  I've been here multiple times both for their Sunday Brunch, and for lunch and dinner.  The food never disappoints, the menu was designed by a real chef, and it's heads and tails above typical \"Bar Food.\"

Specifically, this place has the best burger I have ever eaten in my entire life.  The seasoning is on point, and the fried egg on top (optional) is always cooked perfectly.  The Sunday morning Brunch Mimosa's are actually made with Original Sin Hard Cider, which makes for a unique and delicious mimosa.

My only complaint is that this place is KILLER on my wallet, but alas, you have to pay for good food and drink.  Will be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"I figured this was going to be just another broey bar, but I stand corrected. Taphouse is a little too loud for me, sometimes, bar-wise, but they have an incredible, ever-changing selection of beer, & more surprisingly, their food is REALLY GOOD. The Brussels sprout pizza is to die for - I may never get anything else there - & their soft pretzel is the perfect drunk food to soak up some of your boozing. They've also got a quieter upstairs space, great for dining during happy hour, & a spacious back patio that makes it a great stop on sunny days."}
{"text":"Going to make this short and sweet: simply, I love the Tap House.  Terrific selection of microbrews, great, friendly, attentive (but not hovering) and knowledgeable service, relaxed atmosphere, delicious eats, enough room to breathe and hear each other talk. Plus chalkboard-bar-tops and colored chalk to doodle with for the artsy drunks in all of us.  It's our number one go-to gastropub, whether for just ourselves or friends/family visiting in town.  And given Cleveland's excellent food, microbrew and gastropub scene, that's saying a lot.

Recommendations:

Eats: their \"I heart moule frites\" (mussel fries), richly savory mussels in a beer sauce, tossed with crisp fries and generously topped with crumbled bacon and blue cheese, satisfy me in ways no person or thing has ever satisfied me or ever will.  Their pretzel with beer cheese sauce is excellent as well.

Dranks: there's multiple brew available for every palate and I have yet to meet anyone on their staff who won't voluntarily launch into an enthusiastic, detailed discussion of heads, noses, mouthfeels and other finer points of one brew vs. the next.  You tell them what you like, they make you a customized sampler.  The selection gets updated seasonally; generally, expect at least a score on draught and about 80+ in bottles.  Selections from Rogue, Southern Tier, Troegs, Victory, Stone, Bell's, Dogfish, and even Hitachino make their list.  

Can't say enough about TTH.  What a boon to Cleveland, may it stay fantastic and stick around forever."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Tremont Tap House and it was excellent. I came here for my dads birthday dinner and made sure we got in early enough to catch their happy hours specials before we sat. Man what a happy hour selection. I think we pounded 4 Kona Big Waves before even getting seated. Great start. We also went for their Happy Hour White Garlic Pizza which came just as fast as our next rounds of drinks. Buzzed and ready to eat, our waitress sat us and pointed us straight to their burgers. I was tempted to try the Salmon BLT, but my dad and I ended up ordering burgers. Me, the Joshua, and my dad, the Green Chili Burger. These things seriously made me question what my favorite burgers were. I can't say too quickly it was my absolute favorite burger ever but definitely pushing it. That is why I'm looking so forward to coming back! Ill get another burger, see how I'm feelin about it round two, and possibly crown it BEST BURG EVER. Ok I'm done. Get some Mac on the side also."}
{"text":"I had a chance to have dinner at the Tremont Tap House and was really impressed with my food and the ambiance.  My boyfriend and I were seated in the beautiful patio area.  I felt like I was in a picture in a better Homes and Gardens magazine.  The tables are cute and Pottery Barn-like and there's a really nice fire pit.  

I'm not a beer drinker, but my boyfriend said their list is impressive.  we tried out the soft pretzel appetizer and really liked it.  I had the house salad to start and really liked the combo of greens, candied nuts, and tomato dressing.  We both got the macaroni and cheese entree.  I opted for the chicken free version and thought the figs added a really nice flavor to the brie and rosemary in the sauce.  My boyfriend thought his was just ok, but he prefers more traditional pasta.

Service wasn't spectacular, but the restaurant was packed and there were only a few servers.  This off the beaten path Tremont restaurant is definitely worth checking out.  I hear they serve a mean brunch, too."}
{"text":"I hate doing it this way. The food was a solid 4 stars. Hanger Steak was cooked perfectly. The beer list is a 5! The waiter, on the other hand, needs to spend as much energy on paying customers as he does on the cute bartender. With a better waiter this place would have easily been a 4 or 4.5"}
{"text":"Yum! Looks really quiet from the outside -- sort of like a hole-in-the-wall based on the surrounding area --  but once you're inside, the atmosphere gets you excited! Our waitress was very knowledgeable with the beers, and offered us samples of anything we wanted to try. I definitely recommend getting a flight, so you can try multiple beers for only $10! The food was great, too. One of the best lamb burgers and calamari I've ever had."}
{"text":"Oh no. No thank you. 
I was looking for food in town mid-afternoon on a Sunday, didn't know the area. Grabbed a seat at the bar, kitchen closes in a half hour, perfect! Foolishly ordered steak and eggs (no idea what I was thinking, that's usually overpriced and leftovers) Asked for medium rare. Steak was both super undercooked and old (not something I would have served out of my own fridge). Grosssss. Sent the food back. Had a beer flight instead (excellent beer selection). Everybody happy, not going back."}
{"text":"I have a tendency to come here with large groups of friends.  

The burgers are pretty nice.  The pizzas are very meh - the last time I ordered a pizza here, the edges were burnt and it didn't taste like much otherwise.  They also have a lot very create craft beers that they rotate frequently, so you can try a different drink each time.

Their happy hour prices for burgers and pizzas are very nice.  However, be forewarned - one time we put in our orders for happy hour at 6:57 pm (3 minutes before happy hour was over).  The waiter did not get in our orders in time, and ended up taking off $3 from everybody's meal instead.  The problem with this was that the happy hour menu is so amazing and cheap that taking only $3 off of our meal was really overcharging us by about $10.  Was very disappointed that day."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Tremont. Hands down. I come here just about every Friday and belly up to the bar. Not only do they have countless beers on draft, but their food is equally amazing. Try the Banh Mi sandwich, Chorizo Pizza or their side of Mac n' Cheese. Don't forget to look at their specials board above the booths! Whatever you pick, you can't go wrong. 

Check out the Butcher & The Brewer beers that they have on house drafts. The Repeater is ."}
{"text":"dropped in on a Saturday night with no reservation.   Dinner for two -- no problem.   Greeted quickly and hospitably and taken to an upstairs table.   Excellent service -- fast and accurate.   

Beer selection was very good although out of a few options.   

Food was tasty -- 4 star.   We started with the pork nachos and found them interesting but not particularly great.  I would skip those.

But then we shared a mushroom pizza -- excellent.  Crisp crust,  lots of fresh mushrooms,  bubbly cheese.  Yum.

We definitely recommend the Tap House and would visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"great atmosphere, taplist and food. Would definitely visit again if in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was in love the minute I walked in the door (my 1st night out in the Tremont area), and the reason why a entire hoppy beer board.  Seriously I was dying and then as I look at their amazing beer list I see the Dogfish Punkin ale (one of my all times) although it ended up being kicked, oh well.  

I ordered the sampler $10 for 4 (4 oz *i think* tastes) since I couldn't make up my mind with all the hoppy options out there.  I liked the 22nd amendment die something beer and of course the ithaca flower power which I had had before and what ended up being my session beer for the remainder of the evening.  Seriously that beer it stellar.  It \"knocks you over the head with hops\" as the beer descriptions like to say with some floral stuff going on there too (not to sound like some kind of dinkus describing beer like wine).

Now the thing about the sampler deal is that you aren't making out so well $$ wise.  You are basically getting a pint of beer for $10 which is almost double the price of the rest of the stuff on their menu.  I'm not normally a person that orders samplers so maybe this is par for the course, but it doesn't seem like the best move.

I did eat there as well, got a mixed greens salad and the shrimp tacos.  I wasn't sure what I was going to get on the menu and was worried the food was going to be bad, but I was pleasantly surprised by the great taste and restraint of sauces on the shrimp and salad.  I think most crappy places like to sauce the shit out of their food to cover up bad ingredients and the TTH certainly doesn't do that.

I really dug the adobo sauce rub on the shrimp, mighty tasty and the radish pickley thing was very tasty too and they didn't just throw it in some room temp tortilla that had been sitting there, they toasted that thing and i think even put a little swipe of butter on there.  I was crazy hungry when I got there and the salad and tacos were totally enough (I was worried I had ordered poorly, seriously tacos at a gastropub not normally a solid choice).  My dude got the burger and dug it although could only eat half (buttered bun, moist fatty meat, super tasty but very rich).  The fries looked good and tasted fine, but we got there on the later side (do people go out to eat super early here in the Cleve? or do people just not eat at places like that, something that i've been noticing but that's just an aside), so they weren't fryer fresh and let's face it, fried stuff just ain't worth the calories if it ain't fryer fresh.

Can't wait to go back there, the outside patio is killer (spent some time out there enjoying my rollies) and can't wait to go back on a night when it's not raining (although the 3 weeks i've been here, it's rained like a bastard)."}
{"text":"I've only had brunch here, but can't wait to try dinner.  Just creative enough to be interesting but still exactly what you imagined when you ordered.  Delicious, simple, straighforward, fresh food.  Yum."}
{"text":"Good food, good relaxed atmosphere. Have tried a couple of the sandwiches (salmon, turkey club), nothing that memorable. Service was OK, despite being pretty crowded."}
{"text":"Sun-dried tomato risotto is a MUST try. 

Great beer selection. INCREDIBLE food options. 

Fun atmosphere. (Big summertime patio). Large private room upstairs. 

Sometimes there can a long wait - it is worth the wait. They typically take reservations.  Slightly off the beaten path in terms of Tremont locations.... but very worth the venture."}
{"text":"The calamari is the best in cleveland!!  You would never expect it from a bar, but this stuff is amazing!

I've had it several times and its always well cooked (not chewy), perfectly crispy with amazing breading, and topped with an amazing sauce!  Can't be beat!

Also, the beer selection is great, salads are fresh and everything else I have seen has always been raved about.  Gotta try the burgers too!  Top it with an over easy egg!  YUM!

This isn't just your average bar with average bar food!  Great drinks and great food at reasonable prices, and the staff is ALWAYS friendly!  

Definitely a great place just outside all the hustle and bustle of professor ave in tremont!"}
{"text":"Good food, with smaller portions. Unless you get a burger- those are amply sized. Great beer selection & music. I would have given a higher rating if the service was friendlier/ better and if it were not so uncomfortably hot inside."}
{"text":"We took some out-of-town guests here for dinner last night, and the Tap House absolutely knocked it out of the park. I'm pretty sure we ordered one of everything on the menu and left every plate clean. Standouts were the \"Pig and Pig\" with the creamiest grits imaginable, tender short rib, and mac & cheese. I also love that they do a choose-your-own beer sampler with four pours. We had a great time working our way through the ample and thoughtfully chosen drafts.

And don't quote me on this, but I'm pretty sure Zack Bruell was sitting next to us. High praise!"}
{"text":"I am tempted to give this place a 1-star, just to discourage people from going there, so we can have it all to ourselves.  But I am a giving person.  

Geez, I love this place.  Sometimes I want to curl up in the corner with my Founder's Stout and sleep over.  There is nothing better than Founder's on tap on a cold, snowy night.  Sadly, they eliminated their 5 star salad - the Tap House House - from the menu.  Why, oh, why?  Food is great and inexpensive, ambiance is pretty chill unless there is a group of housewives from Bay Village visiting the big, bad city.  We pick and choose times and nights we go for Maximum Chillness.  

Agreed on the reviews of the good and bad service.  Some of the servers and bartenders don't get it. I wish they would clone Christian (greatest bartender ever) and Kerry (greatest server ever) in their  basement cloning area (located next to the Founder's kegs). There are two other great servers (girls) but I can't remember their names.    

On second thought, don't go here, you won't like it at all.  Stay away.  There is a nice TGI Friday's west on 90 I'm sure you'll love."}
{"text":"Quick review - Go here now! 
If you need more convincing, read on. 
The beer list is top-notch. In fact, I press you to find a better one in Cleveland. 
The servers know their brews and can give good direction to a novice. 
I almost always get \"The Joshua Burger\". It's a bacon and cheddar cheeseburger and it fits perfectly with a good IPA. Sometimes, for Sunday Brunch, I'll even throw a fried egg on top. 
My new Tap House go-to -- The Tap House Philly. Shaved rib-eye, wild mushrooms, onions, peppers, and an amazingly original buttermilk blue cheese topping. You've never had a sandwich like this. 
The venue is quaint with the eclectic feel of city living. 
If you're still not convinced... Tap House has a solid web-site with menus and beer lists."}
{"text":"SUMMARY: It's ok. Patio part might be better.

FULL STORY:  Came for dinner and a drink on a weeknight.  Quite a few beer options... and we were able to taste a couple.  Liked what I ended up with (made in Columbus!) quite a bit. 

They had some weird options too, like a banana-flavored beer... which was about as good as you'd expect banana-flavored beer to be.  eeek.

Had seen a few things on the menu that sounded great...  but ultimately the food was underwhelming.  Decent bar food I guess.  

The \"brussel sprout pizza\" had a lot of oily, melted blue cheese.... but baaaaarely a shred of brussel sprouts!  You definitely had to search for anything green.  Not terrible, but would have been way better with some actual onions and sprouts.  The polenta with veggies was.... ok.  I love all the ingredients they use in this (kale, tomatoes, polenta)... but the overall finished dish just wasn't that tasty. 

Service was... ok I guess.  Just kind of plopped things down and walked away.  

The place was small and pretty noisy.  A little tough to chat and catch up. 

Patio looked cool, but it was rainy, so we stayed inside.  Was pleasant how they had the windows open though!

Maybe would re-consider this for a beer outside one day. 

Note: Small gravel lot."}
{"text":"I like a place that updates its menu from season to season, but that backfired on me when they changed what was quite possibly my favorite entree in all of Cleveland - their macaroni and cheese with figs.  WHYYYYY did they have to get rid of that?  It has since been replaced with a good but forgettable cheddar and parmasan mac and cheese, with veggies. If any Tremont Tap House employees are reading this - I beg of you - please bring back the mac and cheese with figs!"}
{"text":"Cool place, but for my first time there were a couple of things that were off...maybe it was the rainy weather.  First, the beer selection was good, but at a time where it wasn't \"crazy\" it was a bit hard to get the attention of the bartenders and I was standing in the middle of the bar.  When I flagged a bartender down it seemed like I aggravated him by asking him if they had seating upstairs?  Don't know if they do or not as he asked \"why I wanted to go upstairs?\"  I was there to meet a group and didn't see them in the main seating area, but as soon as figured out the people that I was supposed to meet his attitude changed.

From that point on it seemed like he was overly helpful, but still messed up my beer order for all three beers that I ordered.  Everybody that I was there with seemed to be having a good time as I arrived late, so I will just drum up this experience to an exception and not the standard.  

I am willing to give any place a second chance, so I will adjust accordingly next time."}
{"text":"LOVE the outdoor projector for a cool night of watching sports! Patio is great. Drinks are reasonably priced. Could use a longer beer list."}
{"text":"Really solid bar and restaurant in the Tremont neighborhood. Really interesting and delicious menu and the service is always top notch. The bar itself is clean and comfortable. Worth a try for a beer and a bite while watching a game."}
{"text":"Now that I have been here a couple more times, I can say that the Tremont Tap House deserves a 5 star review.  

The atmosphere is really cool and comfortable - a place you can hang out at night and have great beer, or a brunch joint where you stroll in with the same clothes you had on from the night before.  

This place is beer-centric, which appeals to me big time.  But the food is very unique and amazing.  I can definitively say that the pork belly nachos were the best nachos I've ever had.  The black bean puree was so good I felt like putting it on my face like war paint as I devoured the nachos with my bare hands.  Despite being pork belly nachos it was not nearly as heavy sitting as I would have expected.  

This place has about everything I want in an establishment and its all done a bit differently and very well.  Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"I am a regular patron here. I am 31 and I was with my wife and refused a beer bc I didn't have my id, although my wife had hers. We live 500 ft away. Not really sure what's going with this place and newer employees. Good food but poor, mindless service."}
{"text":"My first time: the bartenders were so cute [and happy!] ! 
Second time, my bartender seemed a bit jaded, quiet, and impatient [although knowledgeable] because I was very indecisive for my beer selection. They had a very large selection, at least 10 drafts and 20 bottles, of all styles, mostly American microbrews, and at least 5 of the large bottled ones that are $10 or so each. For the beer you're getting, the prices are reasonable. 

The walls are brick and there's 4 or 5 small TVs placed for almost every seat to have a decent view. 

The beer selection is better than some other places in Tremont but both times [wintery weekday nights], the place was dead. 

I'll be back eventually, though probably not until it's springtime and the patio is open for happy hour."}

Best meal in a loooong time last night. After our brunch foray a few weeks ago, I had to come back ASAP. We started with the calamari with spicy cherry pepper sauce. The sauce was poured over the squids, and usually this results in a mushy mess, but no sir, no problems here. The breading stood up to the sauce, and the squids were tender and delicious. 

Our entree's were a Perch Sandwich and the Philly Cheese steak with bleu cheese \"whiz\". 
Wow. Fresh fish, a nice cajun style tartare sauce. The cheese steak was to die for. Hand chopped rib eye, some sweet red peppers, and that awesome, awesome \"whiz\". 

Terrific bartenders with great beer selections.  The kitchen pumps the food out at a fast and furious tempo, with plates coming out every 2 minutes.  

I'll be back soon.  Lots to try with this menu.

Carry on."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I expected, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's quintessentially Tremont--the house turned restaurant, the hipsters, the AWESOME food and beer. I would go back again and again. Their draft beer selection is great. I also tried the blue cheese and bacon burger. In a word, yum."}
{"text":"Special little place.  Tons of fun beer to try.  Food is gastro pub food and gastro pub food done correctly.  

Bahn mi was amazing

Jalapeño aoili was perfection

If you like smoked cheese their smoked cheese on the Philly was insane.. definitely a unique flavor.

Absolutely love the local flair and feel of this place.  Gem for the city of Cleveland.  Representing us the way we should be represented.  Check this place out"}
{"text":"Didn't come here to drink, so my review isn't based on the \"Tap\" part of the Tremont Tap House. 

We came a while ago (last summer?) and sat outside. The atmosphere is pretty nice, but I found that, while the food was good, it was overpriced for the quantity, which is something I encounter a lot with these trendy restaurants. 

Ultimately though, our server - a youngish man who I've tried to forget - was the biggest a$$hole I think I've ever had wait on me at a restaurant. It's unfortunate for the tap house, because in spite of the pleasant atmosphere and good food, the waiter left such a bad taste in our mouths we have no intention of going back. For a tap house it comes across as a little pretentious."}
{"text":"Exceptional service! We stopped in late Saturday afternoon just to see what the place was like. We've driven by for years and it always seemed to be in a continual state of rehab. What a great surprise! A very welcoming pub environment. Really friendly and engaging staff. They make you feel like you want to stay and enjoy the atmosphere. It's a great old building. Tremendous beer selection and great patio. Really hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Great place, can be a little pricey. However, they have some things here that are simply delicious that you can't get anywhere else. The biggest thing that comes to mind: pan fried aged Gouda. So good, especially with the marmalade they put on top of it. Something else amazing they have is the green chili burger. I was worried it was going to be too hot for me, I like spicy but not too spicy, and it wasn't. It was great.

Here's what I mean when I say it can be pricey: $8.50 for two perogies, and they aren't good enough to justify the price. $7.50 for a pretzel. $12 for mac and cheese--if you want to add chicken or chorizo to it, you're eating $16 mac and cheese (it is pretty good though). 

If you're going here on a Friday or Saturday night, keep in mind: it gets busy!!! There have been a couple times where I tried to go here, but with an hour wait I didn't stick around. I recommend going during happy hour. It is a long and narrow bar, so if its busy you do have to kinda squeeze in between people.

They have a patio, but I have never had the pleasure of experiencing it. I've only been there when it's cold out. I have heard, however, that it is pretty nice, but there do tend to be mosquitoes. I have yet to check that out.

Go here. Get the Gouda. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Great location in Tremont neighborhood. Loved the pizza as well as the happy hour. I used the CLEseats free app and received my pizza for half off. Great deal."}
{"text":"We go every year mostly in the summer. Hostess had a frowny face didn't even make eye contact. BarTenders have no personality. The happy hour  pizza is still excellent  Strike one"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, and the Taphouse is solid. Lot's of great beer on tap - they've expanded their taps to 48 since I'd been there last. Food was good too, burger, pizza, salmon BLT all got the thumbs up from our group. Only thing that was a bit weird was the upstairs, where we were seated, had more of a dark, bistro feel which was totally different than the downstairs by the bar. It was a bit of an odd transition atmospherically speaking, and would be cool to have a small bar upstairs too. 

Overall, good food, great beers, good times. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm a weekly bruncher and I try this place a few weeks ago. Not a fan. I do not ever need to return here for brunch. Coffee was like water, food was cold, Average, expensive for what I got. I do not understand how they are so busy for brunch. Although I do have to say the staff is very welcoming and hard working."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. I started going over the summer and really enjoyed the Patio. I have to say no matter how busy the place is, and it gets busy, the service is always fantastic. They have a great selection of craft beers. I have yet to actually eat here, but everything always looks and smells amazing!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I just came on an off night, but did not enjoy this at all.

I ordered the Woldof Salad with chicken. The chicken was cold and had absolutely no flavor. I would have told my server about it - but she was constantly at one table and ignored the rest of us.

Salad dressing - bland. Not much flavor at all. I actually had to salt and pepper my food, which I try not to do when eating out."}
{"text":"Beer selection was great, close to 50 taps. Food was good and moderately priced. Staff was friendly and helpful. Really everything you want in a bar."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a little bit of happy hour earlier this week while on my way to an Indians game at the Jake.  They have a very nice selection of craft beers (including several Ohio-made) and some good happy hour food to accompany them. I liked the German pretzel and cheese plate. The bar's setting is very nice and the fellow bar customers were friendly.  I especially liked the large open window behind the taps. Service was quite good; the sever was very nice and very attractive too!

I'll be sure to return next time I'm in Cleveland for a game."}
{"text":"I have been to Tremont Tap House twice for brunch (I love brunch!). It has a great energy. Loud and active but I can still hear my friends talk. Parking is pretty easy. When making brunch plans, I usually mention Tap House. Definitely recommend.

Both times I sat at the bar and ordered the eggs benedict without the ham. (complaining - the hollandaise sauce is a little on the sweet side, but its probably because the salty ham isn't there to offset it). The waitstaff is nice enough. My refills on coffee and water have usually a little later than sooner."}
{"text":"Happy hour review!

I finally got around to trying their happy hour yesterday! It was the perfect night to relax on their large patio. Every time we come here it takes about 15 minutes for me to sift through their extensive beer list and make a selection. 

Anyways, happy hour is until 7 and they have $1 off house drafts along with some killer food deals. 

We started with the calamari ($7), white pizza ($6), and soft pretzel ($5). I would pass on the soft pretzel it was small and wasn't.  anything great. The white pizza surpassed my expectations and the calamari was amazing as it usually is here. We also tried the happy hour house burger ($6) and it was my favorite part of the meal. Always get a burger when you come here! Everything came together to make this one of my new favorite happy hours!

Also, if nothing on the HH menu strikes your fancy, try the chorizo tacos and thank your lucky stars you just found out how well chorizo and goat cheese go together. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Tremont Tap House is a great place to go for a casual dinner with a gourmet touch.  The atmosphere is typical of a trendy tremont bar, but it's also a decent place to watch a game.  The beer menu is obviously as extensive as you'll find with over 100 beers.  The food is delicious.  I've had the mussels twice and they are simply amazing.  Also tried the duck once and it was very good.  I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a good meal without having to worry about reservations or dressing up."}
{"text":"In the interest of full disclosure, I'm biased by the fact that:
1)  I am a Tremonster, and 
2) This delightful haunt is right across the street from my baby dog's fabulous puppy care (Hello Mutt Hutt).

The vibe is chill, the crowd is varied, the food is outstanding and the beer selection is one of the best I've seen this side of the Rockies. Plus, on Tuesday's in the summer, baby dog is welcome to hang out with me out on the patio.  =)

Favorites:
Calamari
Pork Belly Carnitas
Green Chili Burger

{"text":"How can this place not have better ratings?? Not only is the beer FANTASTIC, the atmosphere is so unique! I've never seen so many families at a bar before and had it felt so natural and nice! Seriously- pretty cool concept.

They have tons of board games. Pinball machines. Large tables for groups. Good times.

The bartender is friendly and helpful.

The BEER. Oh, the beer. It's constantly changing but we had the Erie Coast IPA, Terminal Imperial IPA and the Chocolate Hazelnut Stout aged in bourbon barrels. All were absolutely delicious. 

They've got homemade mead and cocktails too if you want non-beer.

This place would be my JAM if I lived here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere here. Beer list was great. Server was attentive with the exception that we didn't get sliver wear. We had our appetizers and plates, and our server wasn't anywhere at that time so one of our party got up and grabbed forks and napkins from a cabinet close by. Those in the party with burgers seemed to love them. I had the chipotle pizza and was very happy with it. The day we went (1/10/15) was very cold. We were upstairs and since it's an old house it was very chilly (even near the kitchen). Some of our party left their coats on the whole time. If you're a freeze baby and it's winter, better stay downstairs (very warm there)."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome beer selection, below average service.

Our second trip, we met another couple for brunch around noon. Sure, it was a Sunday game day, but we waited forever for our table. I read reviews suggesting we call ahead (no one answered the phone on several attempts on Saturday night or Sunday). Thank goodness for Left Hand Milk Stout on tap.

We came early and quickly got a seat at the packed bar and ordered drinks while we waited for the table for 4. Several tables opened up in the 30 min we were waiting, but the can't-be-bothered hostess mentioned that the kitchen was backed up and wasn't seating yet. (We weren't allowed to take our party to one of the open tables and drink while we waited...had to stay at the bar.) So frustrating.

The food was really good. My friend and I each had a mammoth chirizo burrito with cubed potato hash browns (with caramelized onions mixed in), it tasted great. My wife had a rich crab benedict (fresh crab instead of canadian bacon) that was tasty and fresh. The other wife had pancakes - she said they were just ok; should have come with a side of fresh fruit - the kitchen was out but waitress didn't mention, diner asked, waitress replies 'I think we might be out'...chef comes out to check on us and apologize - didn't offer anything in it's place, but a buck off our check. 

We had a Groupon so our check was incredibly cheap...service wasn't great on our last trip, but the food was great (dinner) and beers were great too. Hoping this is a phase and they get a great manager who can inspire t heir staff to live up to the quality of food/drink with their service."}
{"text":"Literally one of the best brunches I've ever had in Cleveland!  Tremont Taphouse offers a wide variety of breakfast and lunch eats and a ton of beer options to go with then!  My croque madam was divine with the Gouda giving the meal just the right touch. My friends's breakfast pizza was phenomenal!  Who wouldn't want a pizza slathered in hollandaise?!  The servers were friendly and efficient. The food was served fast and hot!  My experience here was phenomenal and I can't wait to go back for dinner or another round of brunch."}
{"text":"Gastro Pub Heaven ! 

Exceptional  beer, food & movies in the summer on the patio.

Have to work out everyday for a week after an evening here--a good thing!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The calamari is the BEST! the beer cocktails are good - the apple one is the best! Great atmosphere. Great place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, nice outside seating area and indoor. Good selections of beer and the food and portion are great. We went on date night had the Joshua burger minus tarter sauce. Delicious! This to me is a must stop, must try."}
{"text":"Had an extremely good Oktoberfest meal at the taphouse! The schnitzel was amazing and the beer delicious.

The fact that an UmmPah band was playing set the ambience at a higher level and a good time was had by all. To prove that I have the big boot from my beer sitting on the mantle at the house."}
{"text":"Excellent! I was visiting from Miami and stopped by and loved it.  I wish I lived in Cleveland so I could go more often.  Amazing burger."}
{"text":"Tremont Taphouse has a great patio, cool vibe and awesome employees. The food is really good as well. 

What's an amazing thing that Tremont Taphouse has that no one else can really offer then the area? Well there's two things: parking lot and large patio. They use the patio to their advantage by being dog friendly and hosting 'yappy hours' for your pooch on the patio. The last time I was there they had a dog meetup/fundraiser for Huskys. Tremont wins in my book already.

In addition to those perks the food is also amazing. Each month/week they have a featured pizza and grilled cheese. The last time I went I got the Pierogis and was not disappointed. Sautéed and fried to perfection covered in a sour cream sauce with grilled onions! Yum! The beer list is always revolving with it's seasonal changes as well.

Everyone who works there is super nice and attentive. Always willing to help out and make sure your experience is the best.  Give Taphouse a try, I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great place in Tremont! Busy always, so bartenders might take a while getting to you. Great selection of beers, did the 4 beers of 12$. Loved the houblon, also had the Mac and cheese and roasted asparagus, all of which were good."}
{"text":"Really really great burger. Another tremont happy hour. Not happy hour prices but the burger was delicious. Anyone can make a manhattan and pour a beer. I guess if at anytime the burgers are 12.00 getting them for 8.00 is a bargain I would come back just for a burger. The fries are also awesome. When at a bar eat bar food is my motto in this one."}
{"text":"Great little place off the beaten path. 3 of us stopped by on our way back from a Wings game in Detroit. Wasn't to crowded mid day,  The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, the food even better. I had the duck which was prepared perfectly.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great spot! The beer selection is really great. I am a beer guru (especially IPA's) and I was very pleased with the selection. The sampler is awesome. Try the Columbus Creeper if they still have it. It's great. 

I agree with Meagan when she says it can be pricey -- & it adds up rather quickly. The Gouda is amazing. Thinking about it, I crave it now. I had the Joshua burger. It was good but I was not blown away. I will definitely try the Green Chili one next time. Great place and service was attentive but not overbearing."}
{"text":"Best burgers I have had in a while... Great atmosphere and best waiter I have had I think in my life! I know not all waiters will be like our guy but service seemed to be great across the board. I suggest getting a burger or pizza and try the pretzel it was amazing"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I leave work, I hit a lot of traffic going from 176 to 90 West. Whenever this happens, I usually just jump off at the Quigly/14th street roundabout and find a restaurant to hit up around Steelyard Commons. Fortunately, I was feeling a beer after work and I hit up Tremont Tap House for the first time. I've had a few friends suggest Tremont Tap House for drinks but it's a bit too far for me during a regular night out. 

I happened to drop by on a night when they were hosting a beer event with Flying Dog brewing, so I was immediately treated to a free beer glass. Prices of pints were fair at a dollar off during happy hour, so I had a few Copper Cone Pale Ales. I ordered a burger and didn't wait long before they brought it out. Let me tell you, that was a damn good burger. A good beer, great food, and a nice atmosphere (despite the biting cold outside) really made for a great experience. The bar wasn't too busy, but for a weeknight there were quite a number of people around. 

I'll definitely be coming back here. I just wish they would post about their beer events on their homepage somewhere."}
{"text":"Oh man. Honestly, it's reached the point where it's hard for me to order anything other than the green chili burger. It is so juicy and delicious with just the right amount of heat.

Luckily my boyfriend ventured outside of GCB territory last night and got the Brussels sprouts flatbread -- divine. The bacon lardons are so delightfully smoky and salty, the bleu cheese is creamy (but not overpowering!) ...so good.

Service is very good, especially at the bar. Only thing keeping this from 5 stars: I once made the mistake of ordering a chorizo omelet at brunch once -- it literally just contained chorizo and cheese...and not enough of either. And thus it was quite dry. :("}
{"text":"loved the beer sampler - 4 for 10 dollars. I really liked head hunter rye. Also loved duck breast.  portion is small but it was juicy."}
{"text":"I couldn't help but be impressed by this place.  You go in and it's not an intimidating atmosphere, it's just a nice place to sit down and have some beers and enjoy yourself.  Lot's of TVs for sports or whatever else may be one, lots of good food choices, and an unbelievable selection of beers.

I am a huge fan of microbrews on tap, and this place has twenty-four (I think).  While they have my favorite, Dogfish Head 90-Minute IPA, I still feel obligated to try the vast array of beers on their list.  I could see myself going here every weekday night and not feeling the least bit bad about it.

If you are in the area and looking for a nice place for a relaxed meal, beer, and maybe a football game - this is your joint.  If you are from around Cleveland and haven't been here yet - get on it!  That's all I have to say."}
{"text":"Came here with 4 other people for bf's birthday dinner. They don't take reservations but they do take your name if you call ahead, and try to fit you in before the walk-in people. It was busy when we went, but we didn't have to wait too long - maybe 20 minutes for a table of 5 (we also called ahead, but booked it for 7 instead of 6, which we decided on last minute). 

Happy hour prices makes me very happy! We ordered the calamari and white pizza from the happy hour menu. Two of our party got the tasting flight (4 beer samplers for $10). They are nicely sized, and selection is quite nice, although I would have preferred to see more ciders. The beer cocktails sounded really good, but I didn't get any. 

Appetizers: 
- Pork belly nachos - huge; I'm not a fan of beans, but the bean sauce covering the nacos was delicious; wish they had more pork belly slices in there though. 
- White pizza - not as flavorful as I expected; probably will not get this again. 
- Calamari - this was a big hit at our table. Even my bf, who does not usually like seafood loved this. Sweet with a tiny hint of spice. No hint of fishiness at all.

Food:
The plates are huge! Our friends ordered some chicken pasta thing, steak, and a salmon BLT sandwich. Bf and I ordered a burger - he got the Joshua burger with the works. I got the green chili burger with the works. Each plate came with fries. I only got around to trying my own dish. The burger was fantastic. However, had to eat it layer by layer as it was way too huge to cut or pick up. I loved the bun and wished they actually had more bun and aioli. Fries were nicely done, crisp. Leftovers just as tasty the next day.

Overall, tasty. Wouldn't mind coming back again for the happy hour. They have the house burger for only $6 at Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"I've been there several times and had great food on their very nice patio.  The Sunday brunch is nice - breakfast pizza, grilled cheese, and mushroom omelet were all delicious.  Service wasn't the best.  

We went there last night for happy hour to check out some beer week specials.  The beer was good, but the happy hour food was not.  We had the calamari and the burger with fries, and both were the standard greasy bar food at best.  

I recommend it for the brunch and the beers, but not for the bar food we had.  

Note that they don't serve wine at all!  Just beer.  

The atmosphere is nice, especially the patio, but the interior is cozy as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to in Tremont.  Low key, great beers and awesome food.  Good service and a friendly environment.  I've been here mostly for brunch or late night food and have always had something different and delectable, food-wise.  

Just had the eggs benedict for breakfast which was amazing and served with home fries.  Ordered a bloody to go with it and will probably nix the horseradish next time.  It was beautiful, but a little much for my taste.  I opted for a mimosa for my second drink o' the day which was good.  Instead of using champagne, they pour (a nice, healthy portion) of their cider in a snifter and then top it off with OJ.  I was apprehensive at first (no bubbles?!) but it tasted delish, and way more bang for my buck.  I'd highly recommend.  I've also had their mussels which are presented on a bed of fries where a bunch of mussel goo flows freely onto.  That was also really good.  However, it was also late night and the stranger's calamari next to me was really good, too.  

Even more enjoyable when the weather is nice.  C'mon spring."}
{"text":"If you want a good run down of their menu READ THIS REVIEW. 

Let me start by saying, I am a HUGE HUGE fan of Tremont Taphouse. It is my go-to restaurant in Cleveland. You seriously can't go wrong with any of their menu items. 

Caesar salad - This used to be on their menu but no longer is. The dressing was quite different, which I loved. It had pickled onions, salsa, and a fried quail egg on top. It was super delicious and I am so sad that they took it off their menu. It wasn't your ordinary caesar salad. It was more. 

Turkey club - I skipped over this sandwich many many times because I thought what's so special about a turkey club? WRONG. I was terribly mistaken because this was damn right the best turkey club. The bread is perfectly crunchy, there's plenty of bacon, the avocado compliments the sandwich, and the pickled onions have a nice tang to the sandwich. Oh I forgot their delicious jalapeno aioli that is amazing on ANYTHING. They serve it with their awesome fries. I dream about this sandwich. 

House & Green Chili Burger - Tremont has the best burgers. It's so juicy and flavorful. I always get it with The Works (Fried egg, caramelized onions, and wild mushrooms). And I always ask for a side of jalapeno aioli to dip my burger and fries in. It gets a little messy when you add the works in but it's so worth it. I love it when the yolk pops and I get to sop my burger in it... Scrumptious. 

Pan Roasted Chicken - HANDS DOWN THE BEST CHICKEN DISH. This dish changes seasonally. I tried it when it came with a mushroom and leek sauce. Now it comes with bacon and a creamed corn sauce. The chicken is always perfectly cooked. It's so damn juicy and perfectly seasoned. I just cannot say enough good things about this dish. If you don't try this, you're just plain dumb. 

White, Chorizo, Wild Mushroom Pizzas - I love their pizzas. It's always crispy and super cheesy. If I had to choose a favorite it'd be a tie between white and wild mushroom. I love how the white pizza has boursin cheese smeared all over it. 

German Pretzel - It's not my favorite appetizer but it's still pretty tasty. There are so many other great appetizers that you could really just skip this. If you really want to try it's on their happy hour menu. 

Pierogies - OMG I LOVE. I LOVE. I can't tell you how much I love these pierogies. They are deep fried, enormous in sized and covered in the most addicting and glorious sauce. It the waiter takes the dish without allowing me to scrape off the sauce I get upset. That sauce is dag on delicious. This is a MUST especially if you live in Cleveland. 

Calamari - It has a great sweet and spicy sauce. This is another happy hour item. I don't get it often as there are other appetizers that I love. 

Crispy Smoked Gouda - This is my least favorite appetizer. It just wasn't that great to me. Skip this. 

As for the atmosphere, it's really hippy and cool. They have a great beer selection. You can get a flight (3 tastings) of beer for just $10! Overall this restaurant is just awesome. As other reviewers have mentioned this restaurant deserves more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"They have hard cider!  Not every bar does, and I love the stuff.  This place is laid-back and friendly.  My favorite dish is the butternut squash salad.  It's delicious!  The frisee salad with goat cheese is placed atop roasted squash.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Tremont Tap House seems like another one of those places that my non-drinking prevents me from getting the whole experience.  

Overall, it's a pretty cozy establishment with a beautiful patio that makes for a nice night out.  

The wife and I visited for dinner an few days a go, and for the most part liked it a lot.  

Why the three star rating then?  

Well, to be fair, TTH probably deserves a 3.5 but with no half stars to give, I'm electing to be conservative. 

The high points - other than a seemingly long wait to get seated, the service was great - friendly and attentive, and helpful in answering questions about the menu. 

The food was delicious, salads, appetizers, sandwiches ,all of it tasted great, comparable to some of the better stuff I've had around town, and once we placed our orders, it seemed to come out pretty quickly too.  

The reason I'm rating conservatively is that we kind of felt that the price to portion ratio skewed a little bit toward the small side.  Is this being picky? Maybe, but we were using a gift certificate on this occasion so we were ordering with impunity.  Had we come in and spent cash for the meal, I probably would have felt that it was a little skimpy for what we paid. 

I know there's all kinds of arguments to be made about the ridiculous nature of portion sizes, the cost of well prepared, carefully sourced ingredients, etc., etc., etc., but as it is, I feel like I could get food of the same quality from other well-regarded establishments in Cleveland for either less money or more for the same price.  

With that in mind, I want to reiterate that the food was delicious and the service was great, so if you're not as miserly (or as gluttonous) as me, you should probably bump the rating up to a solid four stars."}
{"text":"I used to drive by what was the infant version of the Tremont Tap house on my daily commute from my apartment downtown and Metro Hospital and saw the place come together meticulously albeit slowly; but my interest was really peaked when I saw the taps go in the blasted out wall between the bar and the patio. 

This is Jason's (formerly of Jac's on W. 6th) baby and he knew exactly what he was doing when putting the place together. To start, my favorite brew is on tap, Kalamazoo, Michigan's Bells Two-Hearted Ale. Hoppy and delicious, the way beer is supposed to taste! The crowd is a good mix of Tremont locals, downtown white collars and Metro staff, and plenty of TV's at the bar. The chalk at the bar lends itself for creative outlet for drunkenness. 

The real surprise here is breakfast. One of the best in the city! At first glance, the menu may not seem like your usual brunch menu, but take the risk, you'll be glad you did. My wife and I have ordered different things every time we have gone, except for one item: the blue cheese-walnut spread. Although underwhelming by its listed title, this is a fantastic breakfast sandwich! Hearty multigrain raisin toast is schmeared with a tangy blue cheese and walnut spread, topped with spinach and green apple slices. Its fresh, crisp, and really fantastic. 

The omelets and pancakes are also excellent, most recently I had the goat cheese and red pepper omelet. Would highly recommend. 

This place has a lot of charm with the city's best selection of beers on tap and a surprisingly great kitchen (have yet to go for dinner). My only complaint is that service is slow. If you are going on Sunday morning, don't go if you are in a rush. Perhaps I have just been unlucky, but this past time one of the chefs broke his hand, the time before, one of the chefs was out sick, and the time before that the coffee maker broke and one of the chefs had to go buy a new one....that sounds a lot fishier when I actually wrote that out. 

But on a lazy Sunday when the weather is nice, Brunch on the patio can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Service was good and the style is pretty good.   They have a great tap menu with plenty to chose from.   

The issue I have is there is a very small menu and the food is over priced.    It is 10 for 2 pierogi's....     Also the brussel sprouts had zero flavor, which I don't understand because it is supposedly cooked in bacon.   Also what self respecting mid west restaurant has no ranch dressing....    This was a disappointment..."}
{"text":"Finally have champagne and not just cider mimosas for brunch, all Sunday drunks rejoice! 
Had an awesome croque Madame today, just adding to the list of excellent brunch items (try the hash and the biscuits and gravy too!)."}
{"text":"Took my wife here Saturday night for Mother's Day. First time to Tremont and I had no trouble finding this place. They have two floors for dining however the night we were there the second floor was rented out for a private party. Several TVs and lots of beer on tap. Great place for local breweries. They have a large chalkboard with featured drinks on it to help make up your mind since there are so many to choose from. My wife got the chicken mac & cheese and I got the ribeye  steak, both were very good. We also got the Chorizo tacos for an appetizer which were excellent.  They have outside seating as well as a large bar area that is open to the outside. Very nice Decour great place to hang out with friends or watch sports. I would come back."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to the Tremont Tap House since they expanded their parking lot and changed their decor to those super cool taps they have hanging on the wall downstairs - so, probably over a year.  I remembered the food being above average and the drink list being super impressive.

Well, the drink list is still super impressive, but the food is delicious! Maybe it was always this good, but it is much better than I remember.  I tried the enchilada special (which was an appetizer) and, even though it was a pretty nice size for an appetizer, I wished I had ordered two because it was SO good!

We sat upstairs (which I didn't know existed!) during a busy Friday night which is a really nice option if you want to have a quieter, less bar-y experience here.  Even though the parking lot has expanded, we still had trouble finding a spot - it's a very happening place!"}
{"text":"Good food, great beer selection and overall a very fun place.  Nice casual relaxed place to hang out with friends.  Had a party of 6 and told it would be 1/2 hour for table.  After about 45-1hour we decided to break up and grab two booths since their seating for bigger parties is very limited.

Only bad thing about this place is the \"attitude\" of the wait staff.  We had  a chick with an \"attitude\" and if you read reviews it seems to be a common theme.  

Overall great place for fun, food and beer."}
{"text":"I heard that the 3 server girls that I did not like no longer work here. I am glad. They were like the three witches that shared the one eye in the original Clash of the Titans. Worse though. I am glad because this is one of my favorite places in Tremont. 

One of my fondest memories of this place, was when this cute bartender was pouring me a beer, the keg tapped out or whatever, and the beer blew out on her and got her wet. She said, \"Oh my god! It's all over me!\" It was the most erotic experience in my entire life. I still think about it daily."}
{"text":"So good.  Stopped for a beer and an app and couldn't be happier.  Polenta cakes are amazing - GF and have a lot of flavor.  Tap list is super. I believe they are the same owners as butcher and the brewer so couldn't be greater.  Plenty of GF options to drink and eat and we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great beer seletion, great food! I had the Hangar Steak which was served with some amazing caramelizes onions and great french fries. The steak quality was great! 

Best of all (for me): the have a decent Gluten Free beer on the menu. Not too many places carry them."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is amazing I haven't had anything I didn't like! I highly recommend the airline chicken and the apple and fennel salad. It can get busy at times and it's pretty small but they offer call ahead seating which I always do on the weekends. The beer selection is great and their patio is dog friendly which I love! Must try!"}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch and it was phenomenal! The brunch menu had a lot of options and there's obviously no shortage of beer of tap. The food was excellent (we highly recommend both the breakfast pizza and the blueberry pancakes) and the service was outstanding. It's easy to find & easy parking in their parking lot so there's no reason you shouldn't go check it out."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place..  the selection of beer was pretty good overall and included a few surprises (Saison Dupont and Left Hand Milk Stout)the menu looked incredible however execution was sorely lacking..  

Service here is highly inconsistent..  There is one server here who has been a consistent bright spot, but the others range from terrible to completely indifferent..  

The food seems a bit \"off\" for lack of a better word..  never tasting quite right..

I may return here, but it's not going to be my first choice, and it'll not be for a while... I hope in the meantime the fix their operational issues.  If they do I'll gladly change my review..."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for brunch in quite some time. I always, unfortunately forget about this part of Tremont. TTP definitely has a patio worth remembering though with tables great for big groups and plenty of umbrellas. The brunch menu is of decent size and so are the portions. The chorizo burrito I got was as large as one from Chipotle and was stuffed with red peppers, goat cheese and served with potatoes and topped with hollandaise sauce. They also have an extensive beer menu (two columns front and back of an A4 page) which every so often is just what you need with your eggs. I recommend this place for a tasty and leisurely brunch."}
{"text":"I often forget about this place when trying to decide where to eat, but every time we end up here I absolutely love it. Their bahn mi is what dreams are made of. Their calamari is award winning, in my book. Top that all off with an amazing beer selection, and you've got a recipe for success. Also, do yourself a favor and try their goat cheese gnocchi... you can thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"Local bar feel to it. Good comfort food. Especially the mac & cheese."}
{"text":"I have been venturing to the tap house for beers and apps for years now, and the beer selection are alway top notch.  They recently added a pork belly Bahn Mi sandwich to the menu that is amazing plus the waitstaff is always on point and friendly."}
{"text":"We had a surprise birthday party get together at Taphouse this past Saturday afternoon. The staff was super helpful and food was good. The only thing I would say might have made it a little better would be to add a couple more umbrellas on the patio."}
{"text":"The Tremont Tap House is my favorite restaurant in the Tremont area. The menu is amazing - try the chorizo tacos, chorizo pizza, and the huge pierogies. They are incredible.  With tons of micro brews on tap, you won't find any domestics here. It doesn't matter if you don't know what to drink because the staff here is always friendly and ready with a recommendation on what beer to have with what entree, as long as they're not busy.  They are also generous with handing out samples so you don't order something you won't like. (One suggestion: if you're here around October, try the Southern Tier Pumking Ale. It's incredible. I first found it here and have been buying it up for Halloween ever since. )

My only complaint is that when the bar is busy, you will sit. And sit. And sit. Finally, someone will take your order or refresh your drink. I would have given 5 stars if based solely on food and drink, but the service left a little something to be desired. Friendly staff is great, but having to wait too long for service really irritates me.

Overall, I'd recommend the Tap House. I've never had a bad meal or shitty beer here. Limit your expectations on amazing service, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service, beer selection and atmosphere!
The owner was our server and was very attentive.  I found this place on Yelp while visiting Cleveland to see the Rock Hall.  They did a really nice job with this place.  They even show movies on the patio on Monday nights and have a fire pit out there as well.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have only been here a handful of times, but it has been a pleasant experience each time. I was unaware they had an upstairs until my latest visit. 

I had the Croque Madame, simply amazing. I have never been here at night, only brunch and early Sunday Funday drinking, it doesn't seem like too cool of a place to drink at night. I could be wrong, so i will put that to the test and update at a later time."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for drinks and appetizers.  I had heard great things about the Tap House and decided to try something new.  It has it's own parking lot which is a huge plus on a busy street .  We arrived together and walked in. 

The good: What a charming interior.  You feel comfortable as soon as you walk past the door.  A great bar, one you could sit at all day long.

The bad- Unfortunately we almost did sit their all day long.  There were two bartenders behind tha bar chatting away, and chatting and chatting and chatting.  After 5 minutes I spoke up.....nothing. Not a glance or a nod or a \"I'll be right with you\".  A little louder....Did I detect a slight annoyance that a customer was actually asking to be waited on?  Nope.  A third time  EXCUSE ME!  The male bartender turned and looked at us and finished his conversation....while he was looking at us.

Ordered beer and food, both which were great, but who cares, I will never go back there again.  Who owns these places?  Do they not understand that the best beer and food in the world means nothing if the first impression a customer gets is that they don't give a damn whether you stay and enjoy yourself or walk out the door?  I will never get that.  And I will never go there again.  There are too many other places a block away that DO get it."}
{"text":"I liked the Taphouse. I'd give it 3.5/5. Ended up going on Halloween with a group, so thankfully it wasn't busy. Service was great and the people were really friendly and laid back. I don't drink beer, but those who did said what they got (on recommendation) was really good. The food is tasty as well, chorizo tacos and short rib sliders. Definitely try the mushroom risotto if you're choosing a side. My only complaint is the small plates seemed a little overpriced for what we got.

I also wish they had a better street sign because you probably wouldn't know it was there unless you've been before. Be careful parking in the back as well. It's uneven and can be tight, my friend's parked car got rear ended by some guy backing out."}
{"text":"Green chili burger was the best burger I've ever had! I've only had common beers- waitress suggested one from their great selection and it didn't disappoint. Atmosphere was great - couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"I have regrets!! I have regrets!! 

We didn't get a chance to eat here. The food that kept passing by looked so damn delicious. People were smiling after each bite. CURRRRRSE! 

I've seen this location go through a few different names, and this version has been the coolest so far. If you like a cozy, friendly neighborhood grub pub; the Tap house is for you. The beer menu is VAST and we tried as many as we could. The bar itself is a chalkboard. For people like my husband and I, this could mean hours and hours of doodling fun. Seriously. Top all if this entertainment value with heavily poured cocktails and you've got a relaxing good time. 

Gonna go back next time we're in CLE. Gotta check out that grub!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and have a 10 month old daughter, and we don't get out much without a babysitter in town. When we DO get a chance to go out, I research like hell to make sure we go someplace GOOD.....don't want to waste a date night!
We went with another couple, and I think the guys were pining for some beers, so we decided on Tremont Tap House. I had called to see if they take reservations, and they do not, but they do \"call ahead\" seating. It was technically reservations b/c I called on Thursday and the put me down for Friday at 7:30, but whatever. We got right in and chose a table outside (it was a decent evening temperature-wise). The vibe outside was great...groups of friends meeting for beers, people in their 20's all the way to 60's. It was a good spread. The patio also has a privacy fence around it so you are not surrounded by parking lot which is nice.
We started with beers, the fries with jalapeno aioli (recommended by our server over the bacon/cheddar fries), and the pretzel with beer cheese. Both were fantastic. We ended up ordering acouple more orders of the pretzel, and also calamari (which was also good....lightly breaded and fried, had a sweet taste). 
We drank for quite awhile before ordering, and I got one of the \"small plates\", which could really be appetizers or dinner. Since we had multiple apps already, I didn't want a full entree. I got the grilled shrimp tacos, and they were perfect. Besides the food being great, the beers, which I think is supposed to be the highlight of the restaurant (hence the name), were fantastic. Great selection, and our server was very helpful. I could just tell her the kind of beer I liked and she hooked me up. 
I will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Tremont Taphouse!  Great selection of beer, knowledgeable bartenders and staff and amazing food.  I have had many items on the menu for both dinner and brunch and I have never been disappointed.  The pork belly nachos rock!  Nice patio and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Tremont.  The beer selection is top notch and the food is good too.  The patio has many seating options for small and large groups.  The bar is slate with chalk provided so you can write on it.  

If you want a great snack to enjoy with your beer get a hot pretzel."}
{"text":"I'm in town for my sister at the Cleveland clinic. This place is an oasis. 2nd time here in 3 days. Tried their other bar, Butcher and the Brewer too. Awesome beers, food and staff. SO welcoming. Home away from home!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great beer, great service and great food. Their salmon is always cooked to perfection. They also have a good patio"}
{"text":"I liked Tap House the first time I'd gone. We sat upstairs. We enjoyed a flight of beer. We felt like we were in a really great little Gastro Pub. Fast forward. Something has happened to this place. The 2 times since, the food has gone downhill and the service has been even worse. I don't know what happened. Did they have a change in management? Kitchen staff? The food was lacking flair the last 2 times we went. The restaurant seemed a little dingy. And the server was slow and rude. Not a fan. Unless I receive some convincing reasons otherwise, this is no longer on my list of faves."}
{"text":"Was referred to this place by a local of Cleveland and am very glad decided to stop in. 

It is in a location that you would not normally think a bar would be. But don't think you are lost going past all the residential homes and then this place shows up out of no where. 

The four of us who went all decided to sit up at the bar for we were only going to have drinks. All decided on a micro brew from the dozens have on tap. 

Decor and service was very good with a neat feature of being able to walk up to the bar inside or outside to get service. You can also bring your dog if you like for the allow and have area for them. Next time in Cleveland will visit again."}
{"text":"The food here is upscale bar food and always good. Great burgers and they have a fun menu with lots of appealing items. 

It is a nice atmosphere and decent patio. The staff are always friendly and efficient. 

It is one of my go-to spots in Tremont area."}
{"text":"we love this place! First off, it is a great beer bar with a lot of selection and rotation, Second, the food is delicious.....the mac-n-cheese, the bbq chicken tacos, the burgers, and everything else we have tried was just excellent. Finally, the people who work here are so friendly and welcoming. This is that neighborhood bar that everyone loves with amazing food and great service on top of it all."}
{"text":"Good food and a great patio!! What more could you want?? Oh yea, a great beer list!!  Everything that I have tried here has been great - if you haven't stopped by yet you better!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot for burgers and a brew. I had Ommegang Rosetta on tap. We had the pork belly nachos as a starter, and I had a burger for my main dish. I enjoyed everything about this place."}
{"text":"Nice place but had the \"Airline Chicken\" dish and it was very disappointing. I didn't like any component of this dish. Chicken was a portion from a roasting chicken and was fatty with a sauce that tasted like the leftover broth and some butter with cream. Brussel sprouts were undercooked and were bland, and goat cheese with gnocchi looked and tasted like a flavorless tofu. I would definitely not recommend this dish. House salad was great however."}
{"text":"I wandered over to the tap house for a late afternoon snack and a beer.  We arrived around 3pm on Saturday and the place was pretty quiet.  A few patrons, but definitely not busy.  We sat at the bar and were promptly greeted and provided menus, but then it took at least 10-15 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us again and get us beer.  It was very strange, because they weren't busy.  She just wasn't paying attention.  When they beers were dropped off, she turned and went back down the bar before we could even ask to order food!

Needless to say, I was really disappointed with the service.  A new bartender arrived halfway through our meal and was much more attentive.  We split the Banh Mi and Mac and cheese.  Both were good.  Not phenomenal, but pretty good.  I also really liked the beer sampler option.  4 samples of any draft for $10.  They had some unique brews on tap that I had been itching to try, and I'm glad I got to sample them.   

All in all, I would have given this a 4 if the service was better.  Above average food, neat concept, quiet and unassuming location...all of the ingredients for success, just step up the service!"}
