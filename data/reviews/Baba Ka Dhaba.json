{"text":"This place serves reasonably priced great tasting Punjabi fare. You only go because of the food. The place is filthy, the service abominable, and the selection hit and miss. I think they have the best Seekh Kabob in the entire city.

Carry handwipes with you as the grease on their doorknobs will leave your hands looking less than savoury and certainly not appearing like you want to eat with them.

The food, however, is classic backroads Indian and expertly prepared."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday evening. Compared to when I came here a year plus ago, there seems to be fewer tables and business seems to have slowed down. The overall decor of the restaurant is falling apart. Oddly plates and cups were styrofoam and the entree dishes and cutlery metal. Perhaps they don't have enough staff to wash dishes?

The food arrived in a reasonable time and was about 8/10 in taste, better than many N.E. Pakistani restaurants. Would recommend the chicken biryani and specially the kebabs.

Place was very quiet until about 7 pm, when a large group arrived. They seemed unprepared to serve many people, as they couldn't seem to accommodate any additional orders from our table.

The food was good so I am giving a good rating, but the restaurant itself needs attention.

Also, don't bother calling ahead as no one seems to answer the phone."}
{"text":"I ordered here last night through JUST EAT. So hungry...needed my fix, but what to order? They've got a great rating (FYI - they appear as Babba Dhaba) on JE so I figured it must all be good. Stuck with a couple of medium spicy veggie Samosas, some Palak Paneer, garlic naan, Kheer and Gulab Jamun. 

Samosa-love-at-first-bite! They were crispy, but didn't fall apart when bitten into. The texture of the filling was almost velvety, but had so much flavor! Nothing bland here. One thing I would have loved was a tamarind sauce or something like. Not that there wasn't a lot going on already, it's just that I'm such a dippy gal...lol

The Palak paneer was very tasty. Spinach, delicious, but paneer was a little firm, bordering on rubbery. Still delicious though. Overall the dish was a little oily for my taste, but it didn't stop me from eating half the container in one sitting! 

The garlic naan was fresh and the texture was excellent. Not too crispy, not too soft. The garlic was not overpowering, so for those who enjoy a milder garlic naan, this is the place for you! 

Desserts...didn't make it to the desserts. I was too full! I will definitely update the review when I have had a chance to sample them. 

The delivery service was spot on as well. The food came within the expected time and the driver was super nice! I will definitely order from here again. Thank you Babba Dhaba!"}
{"text":"what can i say about baba?

a couple of things that you have to keep in mind when going to baba:
1) the service is horrendous. i will state that although the owners try really hard to have a restaurant, it's clear that they really wanted to just open a joint to hang out with his buddies.
2) you never know if you will be getting paper plates, proper plates, styrofoam cups, or plastic utensils.
3) the wait for food can take anywhere from 10 minutes to more than an hour. seriously. 
4) their menu is really just a note saying that \"we may have the ingredients to make this, but have a 2nd choice in mind\"

- i used to go to baba once a week with work colleagues, and the only real reason we kept going back was the food. IT IS DELICIOUS. (not sure where the other reviewers were). it's one of the few places in calgary that do not bring the spice level down for the locals. it caters to folks from the motherland.
- from the chicken tikka to pakora curry to saag paneer to goat curry, this place is pretty dang good. like.... really really good.
- if you have the tolerance to wait through poor and inconsistent service, long waits for food, you will enjoy the food.
- they just did some renos in the last 3 months, so it's a whole lot less divey than it used to be."}
{"text":"Some family friends brought me here today, and for some reason, \"Oh look! An obscure restaurant! Maybe I'm going to discover a gem!!\" did not occur to me this time, which is uncharacteristic of me. I am usually excited at the possibility of discovering a 'gem' off the beaten path, that most people dont know about yet. No such initial excitement from this place.

Anyway, when we were seated, the man taking our orders was rather lethargic. He seemed nice enough, but a bit lost/lazy/slow. It also took them an awful amount of time to get us a few extra pieces of cutlery we requested, or the few extra plates we asked for. 
We ordered a LOT of dishes, and waited patiently for about 40 minutes until they brought the food. Upon arrival, the food.. was meh. Among the 7 or 8 different types of dishes we ordered, absolutely nothing stood out. What a disappointment.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was also strangely bland. Sun was pouring in through the glass door, and we were seated in a couch-like booth, so one would expect it to be comfortable/cozy, but no. It seemed like no one put in enough time into this place to make it a pleasurable experience. From the waiter to the vibe of the restaurant to the food - it left a LOT to be desired.

..Probably wont go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. VERY SPICY RICE! 

I have asked for plain rice and still get the same spicy spicy rice. I guess they do not make plain rice.

Butter chicken is to die for. Nan is also very good."}
{"text":"The food here used to be good I personally used to go at least 3 times a week. The last time I visited was almost 2 months ago the price has increased and the quantity and quality of the food went down and also check your bill upon paying they end up overcharging on your tab. Compare them with the menu price.the environment of the restaurant itself is way below standard the washrooms smell like hell I wonder how the health department hasn't  shut them down. While cooking they  taste the dish with the same spoon they use to cook. No doubt they make very nice parathas on the weekends.i am one very disappointed customer never in my lifetime will visit again good bye Baba Ka Dhaba or mansalva whatever you call your self."}
{"text":"So far the WORST Pakistani food I have ever eaten in my entire life. I was so tempted by the reveiws that I thought I must give it a try. I just ordered from just eat.. I ordered beef Haleem and sarson ka Saag. The ordered arrived in 25 mins too cold I was ok with it being cold as long as it tastes nice.. But guess what they fooled me... It wasn't beef Haleem they sent me chanay ki daal which looks really old and stale. It's not beef Haleem there is not even 1%beef or Haleem in the pack... Then sarson ka Saag omg they sent me boiled spinach... Instead of eating this shitty food I'm more tempted to write a review... My money gone in drain... Would never ever order from here and would never recommend to even my enemies!!!"}
{"text":"A lot of these reviews are old so I think it is time for a new review from someone who knows real Pakistani food and has eaten here at least 50 times. From the time when they had just 3 tables and they were a hole in the wall to now when they have over a doz"}
{"text":"One night I was hungry for some Pakistani food  and I had heard some good things about Baba Ka Dhaba.  To be honest, this place is the definition of a dive (which to me is a good sign).  There are three tables and a little window in which to order your food.  While I waited for my food my mouth was salivating with anticipation.

However, when I finally got my chicken tika and my naan I was slightly disappointed.  The chicken was not as flavorful as I had hoped, it left something to be desired.  I guess my real issue was that it didn't have the kick that I had hoped for.

However, I would probably make another visit.  I have hopes the results would be better."}
