{"text":"Blowing caution to the wind, we finally stopped at this fast food locale of fryerdom: deep fried chicken in every which way,  fries, taters and cute little containers of cole slaw and potato salad.

It was a little scary because there was only one other person in this very 1970s looking space and the Big K happened to know her.  She was so EXCITED about the chicken!  Could we believe her? She recommended everything on the menu and was so enthusiastic we wondered if we were part of some secret hidden video commercial segment.

I ordered the  two piece special with taters and thought hmmm... this chicken tastes like Mom's (and that's a good thing)  The taters were covered in more  chicken batter and  were a little too salty for my taste.  But hallelujah... I didn't get that greasy food gall bladder gut wrenching feeling that I normally get from fast food oils.  In fact, the chicken was not greasy at all.

I found the portion sizes huge and had to give one of my pieces of chicken to the Big K (who, contrary to his nickname, is not big, quite slender and can eat huge quantities of food  without gaining weight - don't you hate him?)  As we ate in the very utilitarian surroundings we watched as a line-up grew to the door.  This place is popular."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is awesome, so juicy and amazing. I love the dark meat pieces. The wait sometimes is pretty long, seems like they're understaffed. The wings are what I had today, it was OK, but could be better."}
{"text":"BE FOREWARNED if you have allergies/intolerances!!

Their allergen ingredients menu is over 10 years old and doesn't have anything about soy or mustard on it. I'm soy intolerant and even Mary Brown's head office will NOT help me.  I even pointed out that it's the law for them to have this information available, but they didn't get back to me. So, I'm stuck testing things to see if I get a reaction (thank god I'm not deathly allergic!)


If you don't have any allergies: THIS IS THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN YOU CAN GET!  Way better than KFC and Popeyes, the taters are OUT OF THIS WORLD.  This location is so friendly and nice. My family has been going there for 20 years and the feeling is the same. They sponsor lots of children's sports leagues, so they're obviously into the community, which is great, because their food is amazing, so they are amazing too.

Not sure what to get?  Try the taters.  The chicken is good, don't get me wrong, but the taters are just so delish."}
{"text":"Omg I am in love!!!!!! This is sooooo much better than KFC where were you my whole life???? This is my first time trying out this place and I am now forever converted. The chicken is so tender, their potato wedges are full of potato inside!!! Its not dry at all. This is really by far the best fried chicken I ever had.

They don't have much advertising so its really hard to noticed them. But from now on, I will be coming here! The price is pretty much comparable to KFC, plus they had the 5 free wings free if you buy the feast. Pretty worth it if you ask me."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service and bad tasting food. I have tried Mary Brown's other locations and the food tastes very good.

Food at this location sucked big time. I ordered chicken sandwiches and it was BAD that I had to throw out. The taters did not have any taste at all.

All other locations I've been to are very satisfying."}
{"text":"Today I decided to have my old faithful fried chicken place. Mary Browns has never dissapointed me; especially this location in delicious crispy fried chicken. The chicken is coated in a simple flour dredge that is delicious & key to great fried chicken...CRISPY! I love the potato \"taters\" which are coated wedge fries. They are thick, crisp & mildly flavoured. Both chicken & fries are never greasy! The price point is economical too. A two piece meal comes with pop, taters, choice of macaroni salad or potato salad, or coleslaw & 2 pieces of chicken for only $7.79 plus tax"}
{"text":"Ta heck with KFC, ya gotta step yo game up and do the Mary Browns, I really find the breading on the chicken to be better and the freekin potato wedges got a coating on them that gives them the salty goodness one wants to accompany the greasy yummy chicken. Heck, I even think their side salads are better, also.... EVERYONR loves KFC gravy, but from location to location is varies in consistansy and taste... M.B's gravy is never different.... and very good..... dip those potato wedges in and enjoy.... this is next level fried chicken."}
{"text":"Mary Brown's is a fast food fried chicken place that is better than KFC and maybe as good as Popeyes. The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is because of their taters, otherwise it would be 3. 

Service: 3/5 - you have to wait 5-10 minutes after ordering, this is because (from what I suspect) they only fry the chicken or taters when people order them. On the bright side, this results in the food being hot and fresh, which I am sure many would prefer over french fries and chicken that has been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes.

Food: 4/5 - if you love wedges, fries and potato-based foods in general (like me), i definitely recommend trying their taters. Their chicken is decent but not great and the clear highlight is their taters. It is lightly breaded and fried on the spot. You can tell (as they advertise) that it is truly fresh cut and not that bagged and frozen crap. There is also some light seasoning on it that makes it very flavourful, but not too salty.

Price: 4/5 - a small box of taters is $2.61 including tax, which is well worth it. In comparison, 1pc chicken + taters is $4.79 + tax and 2pc +taters = 5.79 + tax, which is not nearly as worth it. If I was to rate the restaurant in general in terms of price it would probably be a 2.5/5.

Overall the fried chicken is alright but what you should really try are the taters there. Never had anything like it and it is the only thing going to Mary Brown's for in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was told this place has the best fried chicken so we made a point to stop by on our way up north. Maybe I had too high of expectation coming here because I didn't think it was that much better that KFC. we ordered a 4 piece meal for $10. Comes with a small side salads and your chicks of taters or fries. We also ordered a side poutine. The chicken pieces were really small but they were pretty tender. The side of macaroni tasted just like KFC's and the poutine was just ok. Your typical French fries with average tasting gravy and plastic cheese curds. I still prefer Popeys."}
{"text":"The best fast food chicken around, by far.  And the taters are fantastic.  Don't order fries.  I don't know why they are even on the menu.  If you want bland fries you might as well get KFC.  Taters are what makes the meal.  One of our favorite places to grab lunch, we've eaten at this location dozens of times and it is almost always fantastic.  The folks working there at lunch time are great, awesome service."}
