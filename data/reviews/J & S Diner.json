{"text":"If I could give TEN stars, I would! Went there Friday evening for dinner--first time there.  Family had recommended this diner and I must say--they weren't lying!!! The food was AWESOME!!! My husband ordered the breaded fried fish with salad and baked potato and loved it all! I was more adventurous and decided on the Slow Cooked Honey Garlic Roast Pork with a baked potato and salad with the house Balsamic Vinaigrette--absolutely DELICIOUS! The pork melted in my mouth, perfectly seasoned and cooked just right! The baked potato was even the best (and biggest!) we ever had! The house dressing was a perfect compliment to the mixed green garden salad.  My taste buds were singing!!! The owner/chef kept coming out to greet and chat with all the guests!!! BIG PLUS!!! I love it when the owners want to talk and she(and her husband) made us feel so welcome and right at home! It was like dinner with the family--everyone was joking back and forth with us and it just made it so much more enjoyable!  As if we weren't stuffed enough (the portions are generous)--we had to order the Carrot Cake Cheesecake  for our dessert. This was a creation sent from Heaven above! Next time, we aren't sharing a piece--we each want our own slice! The menu offers a variety of fine dinners and the owner told us they rotate between three menus--with at least 8-10 selections.  They only stay open  for DINNER on Fridays...the rest of the week they close at three...but they open early (6/7 am, depending on the day,) and they are closed on Mondays. This place is a GEM hidden in a cute little town...you won't regret going there. We cannot wait to return and we plan on being \"regulars\" from now on! These good people deserve your business...I love patronizing independent businesses like these."}
{"text":"Good prices and pretty good food. I got the French Toast and home fries. The French Toast was good and potatoes were cooked well, but a bit under seasoned imo.  Others I was with got eggs, breakfast sandwich and an omelet. Eggs were a little bland by their account, but the bagel sandwich looked good. If you go on Sunday, make sure you beat the church crowd, because it does fill up quick. Also... if you're a dog lover, you can eat with your pup in the outdoor eating area."}
{"text":"What a great place. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The food is top notch. The owner makes it a point to come out and make sure that everyone is being taken care of. There is a definite local feeling with conversations across the room. The staff seems to know everyone by name. On Friday nights they serve high end dinners that are a must. Definitely not \"Diner Food\".  I love the omelets and my wife loves the pancakes which are huge. Either way, the coffee keeps coming. While the food initially kept me coming back, the staff makes it a permanent part of my routine. You may have a short wait on the weekends but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot, especially the French Toast! Also went for dinner one Friday night and had stuffed shrimp that we loved!"}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Small outdoor seating also.  Good food staff is great.  Apparently you can sit outside and bring the dog!!! We're going to come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time today for breakfast. It's a little bit out there, but worth it if you want some homestyle cooking. J&S was easy to find and we had no problems with parking. We did not have to wait and it was \"Seat Yourself.\" Our waitress was attentive and polite. My husband ordered a mushroom and cheese omelette and added some bacon in there. According to him, the omelette was pretty good, but could have used another egg. It came with toast, but home fries were extra. I had the 2 egg and meat breakfast and added a black cherry pancake. The pancake was pretty tasty, unique, and extremely large. Prices were fair and service was great- we'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I had much higher expectations for this place. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. When walking in, the room went silent. There was no warm welcome- no music.. nothing- except uncomfortable stares. So, we stood awkwardly. By the end of breakfast, I realized the good reviews are probably because all the people in there seemed to be family, friends or regulars. Overall appearance was dirty in my opinion. The food was below average and didn't seem of high quality ingredients. If you're looking for a quiet hole in the wall that makes you feel like you're having breakfast in a strangers living room, then this is your place. Otherwise, I'd go t an alternative option."}
{"text":"I love a good diner, but I left feeling a little underwhelmed.   This diner is cute. Very small and clearly a small family run shop. They have a good menu and appear to attract a good number of regulars.   I ordered an egg sandwich on a bagel and a side of hash browns. The egg sandwich was good but I was so disappointed with the hash browns. It looked and tasted like a frozen hash brown patty. My husband got the other kind of breakfast potato which looked better, but he said they were a bit bland as well.  My husband got some huge sampler that came with literally everything. He said it was good but not amazing.   I would come back and try other things. The sandwich was pretty good, and I liked the service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love j&s!!! I love Stacy she is the best, she always comes out and talks to her customers and makes them feel at home! I have never ordered something there that I don't like!"}
{"text":"Good prices, decent food. I'm sure I would have been happier getting breakfast here. Solid choice if you're hungry and need a spot to eat."}
{"text":"First timers at J&S Diner and We had a pretty good experience. My husband got the hot roast beef sandwich with a side of fresh cut fries and smothered gravy on everything. He didn't leave one crumb on his plate! However, he did order soup and it never came out. He said he meal was so big he didn't need the soup anyway, so no big deal and the waitress took it off the bill with no problem. I got the special, which was a hot sausage sandwich and it had its pros and cons. It was very saucy (which I love) and the bread was so fresh and soft. However, it was a little too plain. I like my hot sausage smothered with grilled onions and peppers. It was okay, just not exactly what I wanted. We will definitely be back, but next time I think I'll try a burger!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place. The food is always good. Service is quick. We try to find other breakfast places to mix it up but always end up disappointed and bad at J&S."}
{"text":"This is diner was unassuming in a small plaza in a small town, but the food and service were great! The waitress was busy, but attentive. Our food came out very fast and fresh. Overall a wonderful diner experience.  I had the biscuits and gravy and hash browns. The biscuits were soft, hash browns crispy, and the gravy was thick enough without being too heavy with the perfect amount of sausage. I also had the Teamonade (sweet tea with lemonade ice cubes) which was fantastic.   Definitely worth a stop if you're biking the montour trail!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great, high quality food at a reasonable price. Staff and owners are friendly and attentive. Make sure that you save room for the homemade desserts. They are always spectacular.  I routinely buy cakes, pies and cheesecake for holidays and special occasions.  J&S caters, too. I had Stacy cater a graduation party. I had so many compliments on the food and they made it easy for me to relax and enjoy my guests."}
{"text":"A party of six had dinner at J&S Friday evening.  The service was efficient and friendly.  The food was outstanding.  I had the ahi tuna which was done perfectly and the largest baked potato I ever saw.  Our friends had the strip steak and said it was delicious.  I treated myself to the lemon-basil cheesecake and it was wonderful.  The prices are very reasonable.  The chef chatted to us and was personable and fun.  The Friday evening menu changes weekly and I like the variety.  AND, it's a BYOB with no corking charge.  Life doesn't get any better!  Don't miss this little \"diamond in the rough\"."}
{"text":"This is my first review for this small Diner on Yelp but we have eaten here a few times over the years.   Very much the definition of a small family run Diner - small, home style food, great service and great prices.   Breakfasts are excellent in quality and flavor with the link sausage and the real home fries both being great examples of what a Diner breakfast should be.   Zero complaints on all fronts with outstanding service - coffee never empty, no lack of service but not too much attention.   If you're ever in this area and need a great breakfast, you will be extremely hard pressed to find a better place!"}
