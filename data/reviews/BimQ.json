Repeat: No...I cannot stand how slow the male server was....

The food can be summarized as average and not memorable and it's not pricy. Personally I prefer \"Yummy BBQ\" just south of this restaurant..
The male server took the order and proceed to assemble our order, he literally use the thongs to pickup 1-2 bean sprouts/carrot strips at a time. He must be counting the exact number of bean sprouts and carrots to put in the stone pot. He repeated the process for ALL the ingredients. I am amazed I resisted the urge to grab the thongs and do it myself.
I walked past the restaurant in the past, and there's usually a long line, now I know why.....
You are suppose to mix up all the ingredients, so the \"presentation\" lasted for a whole second on my table.
When we place the order, there was 2 people in front of us, when he finished our order, there are at least 8 other people waiting to place their order!

Eat here if you can tolerate the slow speed and the tight space between tables. I'm afraid I would rather eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Once something impresses me, I usually stick with it. When it comes to Vegetable Tofu Kimchi Jjigae (Stew) - $8.99, I am loyal to Bibim Q. The owner lady is friendly but the best part is their food for sure. It is really great that the stew is CLEAN- tasting, since  lots of other restaurants serve greasy version with tons of MSG. The only downside is that the kitchen usually takes a while (20-30min) to prepare this dish, but OH MAN, it is totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  

Great little lunch spot offering good Korean food at totally reasonable prices and the service is consistently very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here for a couple of times and food and the service were always nice. Food is not the best but good. A little bit overpriced, but considering the location i guess its not too bad. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Food is okay, not so great. Price is just average, could find places that offer better. 

BUT, the service is just horrible. Especially with take-out. I don't have much to complain with when you dine in, but when it comes to take-out, it is just horrible. The place is just impossible to park (right along Yonge). And I usually take out when I just don't have the time to dine in -- I am sure that is what people usually do. But the owners just never care about other people's time. I always phone 10-15 mins before I arrive so that they have the time to pack everything when I drive there for me to pick up right away. And I always double-confirm with them, if they are busy and if I can pick up within 10-15 min. The answer was always certain. BUT the fact is, they always cook or pack the food when I get there. Then for the next 10-15mins you will just see my car in the middle of Yonge Street blinking on its emergency lights. This has happened soo many times, that it once really got on my nerves and I complained about it. They apologized, but did nothing. Next time it was still the same. There was even one time that I chose to walk there, because I knew they would not pack my food until I get there, and I did not want my car to be in the middle of the street for 15 mins. And that time, they made me wait for 20 mins standing there. 

One more terrible thing with their take-out service, is the way they pack their stew. I ordered soon tofu stew a few times for take out,. The rice bowl was placed right next to the tall stew jar. When I held up the plastic bags on my way home, the rice bowl would just be squeezed in to the body of tall stew jar. And apparently the food jar was just not strong enough for the pressure and it broke from the middle. Every time I got home, I was left with a plastic bag full of stew, and nothing left in the jar.. .....

I have been a loyal customer for the past 8 years, and nothing has changed after I complained for so many times. Today, again, despite the fact that I called them for take out 12 mins ahead, and told them I will be there soon for just one bibimbap (bibimbap is all pre-made, they just need to pack in a container), nothing was ready when I got there. My car was blinking on Yonge for another 10 mins until I really ran out of patience.. I think this would just be the last time I have ever visited the place. .."}
{"text":"Great pork pone soup, I almost always order that when I go there. :)  The other pre-made food?  *cringe*, I wouldn't get those unless you're in a rush.  Great friendly owners."}
{"text":"Here is where I first experienced my first taste of pork bone soup and bibimbap in the stone bowl. After 8 years, the flavours here have become the benchmark when trying these dishes at other Korean restaurants for me. I'm not Korean so I don't know exactly how these dishes are suppose to taste but i think they should taste like this. It's soooo good. The kind of good that you can't stop eating after you're stuffed (very generous portions). The harmony of all the various veggies, noodles, meat, rice and egg coming together with every bite. Mmmmmm. If you haven't tried it, you have too. The pork bone soup is so flavourful and perfect on a cold winter day. If you walked by this place, you would never think of going in as it is bit of a cubby in the wall. It is definitely a hidden gem in Toronto. I can't wait til my next visit here. Service is also an A plus, always so friendly."}
{"text":"This places is better than the previous reviews suggested in my opinion. I went to get take out. I got the spicy rice cake and a small side of sweet and sour chicken to go. The spicy rice cake was delicious, and spicy too. I recommend getting that. The sweet and sour chicken was a bit dry. I'm guessing it was because I went close the end of the restaurants hours. The service was good enough and I ended up paying $15 which was reasonable for the amount of food I ordered. I will probably be going back here in the future to get take out since it's so close to where I live"}
{"text":"Lookin' for a some good Korean, and we found it. Prices are decent, and service is super nice. 

Had the Dolsot Bibimbap. Delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Short and sweet: Food is pretty good, but they like to trick you with prices. 

They'll say that something is a certain price on their main menu above the cash machine (which is the one everyone looks at), then when the price is all weird, they'll point out some other price on a wall for the same food item. I'm pretty darn sure that they know those two prices don't jive, but they do it on purpose.

I don't care how good your food is; if you lie to me, you lost me as a customer. It's not even super cheap to begin with (things are regular Korean diner price or higher), yet they try to squeeze another dollar out of you, which I think is offensive and shameless."}
{"text":"Overall I'm a fan of of Bibim Q. It's authentic, tasty and they offer a good selection of Korean foods. I will echo that the service is very friendly, and that the staff is very polite. The white gentleman behind the counter is actually the co-owner with his korean wife. They are a sweet couple who really make their customers feel welcome.

The layout and decor is basic, but it is not designed to impress. The place is about good, affordable everyday Korean food. Koreans I know enjoy the restaurant, and they play contemporary Korean music & K-Pop which I enjoy. 

It's my favourite place outside of Korea Town for Korean, but beware the small seating capacity. As well, during winter the tiny space can get mighty drafty with the door opening and closing, but ignore it and enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but after finding small errors on my bill every time (always in their favour) I decided to mention it, but was told that the bill was correct and for a few cents I left it.

Didn't go back for a while, then when I did for just a small item, I noticed that they had overcharged me on the taxes for an item that cost only about $3.00.  As far as I know the PST part of HST (8%) doesn't kick in until $4.01.  Up to and including $4.00 you pay only the GST part of HST (5%).  Pennies, yes, but when you do this to customers every day for years it adds up.  Anyway I was first told that it was my mistake, then I was told that I could not be refunded the incorrect tax because \"the manager isn't here\".  Which turned out to be untrue because the manager was right there in the kitchen.  I don't know what they have to gain by this behaviour.  If they are charging the taxes incorrectly due to an honest mistake, it needs to be fixed in their cash register programming."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I can't decide what exactly I want to have for dinner. The owners are incredibly nice and welcoming. The food isn't super fancy and you can sense that home-made taste so it's the perfect comfort food when you're sick. You can also ask them for substitutions for the appetizers or tell them that you aren't feeling well so they'll do their best to accommodate for you (ex. if you just had your wisdom teeth removed they can provide you mash potato or soup instead of another appetizer ). 

I gave this place a 4/5 stars solely because the place itself isn't a super appealing place to dine and eat. I almost always take it to go."}
{"text":"Nothing that will blow you out of your seat but the service is quick and kind, the price is right, the dduk is good, and newspapers are free. I feel welcome whenever I come here and I can't think of anything bad to say about any of the food I have eaten from bibim-Q -- the gamtajang is juicy, generous with meat, and comes hot but not inedibly so to the table. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The best Korean joint on Yonge Street, hands down.

Been a patron here for like over four years now, but I am writing this now as I am presently suffering from a food coma c/o Bibim Q. It was still as good as the first time I came here. The owners are super friendly and welcoming. Their Kamjatang is flavour to the max and Soondubu is tasty as well. I used to get their combo platter, which is good, but I always prefer some kind of red soup when I frequent a Korean restaurant.

A small storefront, but it always gets super busy during meal hours. People in the hood know what's good.

Only cons: they are closed on Sundays, and they don't give you potato in the Kamjatang."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I tried their Tofu soup and Bibimbap. Service is great but the food itself is mediocre. Not authentic and it's more like Korean fast food."}
{"text":"The food is okay but might as well just go to an actual restaurant. Large portions, good prices. Pancake isn't the best on the market but their kimchi fried rice is really yummy.

Their kimchi reminds me of the store-bought kind from Korean grocery stores, as do their dipping sauce. That being said I enjoyed them, it just doesn't taste homemade which is something I love about most Korean restaurants.

Note: their kimchi fried rice comes with pork, vegetarians beware!"}
{"text":"My go to for Korean food near where I live (Yorkville) Bibimbap is their speciality as can be seen with their name but their other options are great as well. Pork bone soup is their most popular menu item but one of my personal favourite Korean dishes is YukGaeJang which is spicy beef soup. Good prices. I dont recommend getting the cold noodles there, it was a let down."}
{"text":"Exactly what I came for! Simple and tasty Korean food. 
Spicy squid on rice thoroughly rocked my world."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup was decent but not the best I've had.  It's not a full service restaurant, you order like a quick food restaurant.

Have not tried any other dishes but the pork bone soup, I would come back again."}
{"text":"This place may not look fancy but the food is really delicious!!  I went there for the first time with my sister and the service was fast and friendly.  I ordered the seafood soon dubu and it was so yummy!!  I will be back for more..."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch.  It's fairly quiet and not usually overly busy.

I like their Pork Bone Soup as well as their Beef Soup (Yuk Ka Jang).  Their Dolsot BiBimBap is reasonably priced.

Place is small and unpretentious, staff is friendly and food is served hot and fresh with a few small side dishes.

Great affordable option in the area."}
{"text":"Bibim Q is a great neighborhood spot for a cheap and cheerful meal!

It's not fancy.
But the owners are very friendly!
It might not blow your mind.
But it will fill your belly with warm and spicy soup!

The place is tiny and simple with a small menu of Korean staples.
I like soon tofu soup ($8.95) and I often order it for take-out.
They give you rice and I like how they pack sides for you (kimchee and bean sprouts).
A lot of places that I get korean take out from do not give me any kimchee at all!
They bag the soup so that it makes less of a mess.

I like this place for quick, Korean comfort food. :)"}
{"text":"From the outside, the place doesn't look so appealing, but I had a hankering for Korean food yesterday, and decided to give it a try. And you know what?

It's true. Don't judge a book by its cover.

The food is cheap and very, very delicious. Tastes authentic. They also give you quite a lot.

The person serving is so, so, so gentle with your food and makes sure to give you enough. I don't usually tip for take out, but I did this time round because it was that good.

Quick service. Seems to be really quite most of the time?

Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Bibimq became part of my daily routine while I was working with a client in Toronto. After I got off work, I'd get into my running clothes, grab my ipod and a $10, then head out on a short run up Yonge from my hotel at the Eaton Centre--all I needed for a delicious and somewhat healthy meal, with bibimbap or chigae running about $8 including tip. That's right, $8, which is the price of a sandwich in DC. 

I WANT."}
{"text":"Great food and lovely owners. It's a diner style place so not the best for a nice sit down dinner, but the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I come here pretty regularly - there's not many bibimbap places in the area, or at least not many that specialize in Korean food the way that Bibim Q does.  I always get the stone bowl bibimbap, and generally eat in.  It's pretty fast and casual, and tastes so good (fresh and authentic).  The owners are friendly enough, and it's a small enough place that you can overhear them going about their business.  There is technically a couple of tables and chairs sitting out front, if you wanted to sit outside, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone eating there.  It's a great place to eat a quick lunch alone, or to grab food casually with a couple of friends."}
{"text":"I'm not always in the mood for this place, but their Korean food is decent. Their food tastes a little more natural than other Korean restaurants I've been to in the area. The owners of this restaurant are some of the nicest people on the planet, always extremely polite and friendly.  It costs a little bit more than eating at a place like Home of Hot Taste or Yummi Bar B Q which are in the area, but I think the quality is a little bit better too. The interior of the restaurant is small, it can fit around 20 people seated. It also seems to get a bit steamy on the inside during the winter. They do have a small patio out front if you want to eat with your dog, which is hard to come by for most restaurants on yonge. It is a very casual restaurant, almost feels like eating at a food court or a cafeteria. 

Sidebar (totally unrelated to the quality of the restaurant): I'm always impressed when I see the man in the front speak Korean to his wife, he obviously isn't a native Korean, but sounds like he can communicate almost fluently."}
{"text":"I recently flew out of the nest and found out how hectic it is to make Korean food in everyday basis. So bibim q became my obvious place of choice to get rid of my craves for Korean food. Not because it's close to where i live, cause of their affordable pricing and great food they serve. This place focus on quick dine in and does the job. The owner lady is very friendly and welcoming. Makes me feel like I'm home getting food from my mom. May be that's because I'm Korean myself... Might not apply to everyone. 

Over all Bibim Q is a great place for a quick fix and does more than that with their big welcoming smile."}
{"text":"This isn't the best Korean food in town, but it is pretty decent for the Bay/Yonge area, not to mention the couple that owns it are extremely friendly and helpful.

The store-front is tiny and doesn't seat many people, but I think that most people used to call ahead and just come pick up the orders as I did when I was student and lived around the area. They do have some patio seating in the summer. 

Definitely go for the combo platters as they have good value and delicious BBQ chicken/pork and side dishes; as for stews and such, I'd go for a full-service and more authentic Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"BimBim Q is the quick fast food Korean option, with cheerful service. I prefer Yummy BarBQ down the street at Maitland and Yonge, way more options and better food.

Ive been several times, I usually order BiBimBap, but I tried some of their combo options. Its so-so Korean fast food, and Ive never thought it was the best. Its got a straightforward, what-you-see-is-what-you-get feel. Service is above average, and they make you feel like a customer, they are not blase.

Its a good option if youd like something quick, or for takeout, and quite reasonable value. They do have a fresh, open feel to the restaurant, its a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner once. Had the pork bone soup. Was not that good. Also looked dirty. Would not come back again."}
{"text":"Not sure if I just went at bad time and a bad day (Saturday evening on a long weekend)... But I found my experience under whelming. 

Service is great - the place is family run by an older couple. Food comes out fast. Price is a little pricy for Korean food but considered cheap compared for Yonge/Bay. The issue I had was with their portions. I ordered the pork bone soup, and none of the bones had meat on them??"}
{"text":"What I like most about BiBim Q is the service. The owners of the shop are ridiculously cute and friendly. They're always very polite and accommodating. This alone is worth going in.

Additionally, the food is good. Gamjatang is my favourite. It's done well here. It comes boiling to your table. The broth is slightly thicker than most soups and the pork bones are tender. 

Overall, it's a great little restaurant that serves great gamjatang. Make sure you have a chat with the owners, they will make you smile for sure!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in over six months, but suddenly I have a craving for bibimibap now (yes I butcher this spelling all the time).  

I've had their pork bone soup, bbq chicken combo, dolsot bibimibap and their takeout combo where you pick a few items. I would recommend the chicken or beef bibimibap as it comes in a stone pot and the pork bone soup.  

This place made me fall in love with bibimibap (but didn't teach me how to spell it obviously), It's tasty and when you add in their hot sauce and kimchi, it is so delicious.  However, it does take a while to prepare as they have a small kitchen, so it may take around 10-15 minutes to get your order out, but it's worth the wait.  

Also, there is an older lady who works here who acts as the server and a white dude who is the cashier/order taker that are very friendly.  

So why I am giving this place 3 stars and not higher? First off, the bbq chicken tastes like it's chicken with ketchup on top of it. Not very creative.  Second, the combos are not the greatest. It's like an elevated version of Manchu Wok.  Anything that can be comparable to Manchu Wok is a no-no, IMHO.  

In addition, while they try to keep it clean, just due to the pure volume of people and size of this place, it's a bit of a hole in the wall, so the ambiance is lacking and I don't find it has a \"SUPER WOW WOW\" factor to compensate for this.  

However, this is a place I will definitely return to and will probably have lunch from there tomorrow.  Writing reviews makes me hungry. :-)"}
{"text":"I was craving some bibimbap and didn't want to have to call around to see if anyone was free for lunch. I had to get my fix right then and there. I pass this place almost everyday, and realized I could get my quick fix from this somewhat fast-food version of Korean food.

I was greeted promptly upon walking in, ordered their Chicken Dolsot, and was told to grab a seat as they prepared it. I came before the lunch crowd so the wait wasn't too long, and there were a few available seats to choose from (at a quick glance, I'd say it seats about 20).

The dish overall was just average for me. It did come out sizzling when it was served, but quickly lost its sizzle and rice lacked the crispiness that I'm accustomed to. The rice to chicken ratio was heavily skewed towards the rice, and the hot sauce was not as intense as I'd like.

Given the size of the place, I also wouldn't recommend parties larger than four. A party of six came as I was eating, and by then, seating was limited. One diner who was eating alone was asked to slide over to the other table to accommodate for this group, which was a bit awkward.

I'm not quite sure if and when I'll be back. It was okay and did somewhat satisfy my craving at the time."}
{"text":"This place should win an award for service!  The owner and his wife are super duper friendly.  You're always greeted with a smile and conversation if you embark on it.  They always remember familiar faces which is a welcoming gesture.

Their prices have gone up about a dollar on some dishes.  They are a bit pricier than Koreatown and offer a lesser amount of banchans (sidedishes) but in this part of the hood, they hold up as the best.

My usual consists of either the cold noodle (naeng myun) in the summers or the piping hot tofu stew (soondubu) in the colder months.

The cold noodle is a large portion topped with julienned cucumber, pickled turnip, sliced boiled egg, hot sauce and a slice of marinated beef brisket.  You also get 2 side dishes (usually kimchi and hot egg sprouts).  The broth is tangy and consistent so I wonder if they make their own.  Sometime they give you scissors to cut the noodles.  

The last time I was there the piece of beef was missing and some ingredients were subsidized with others.  I was a fan of the naeng myun v.1.  Not so much of v.2.  Too bad I was a pussy and didn't ask where the meat went.  I'll just have to visit again in the summer and see what happened.  Maybe the cook was having a bad day.

The soondubu is simply amazing and satisfying.  Hot and spicy as hell served with a bowl of white rice and 2 side dishes.  It does have a decent amount of meat in that little bowl.  You can't overdo the meat.  I scald myself with pleasure each time I eat it.  No regrets.

Did I mention the square of a patio out at the front?  Fits about 3 smaller tables and is a great place to have a solo meal to contemplate and watch the Yonge Street madness.  While others are stuck in traffic next to you, you can taunt them with the spicy bowl of whatever it is you're eating.  I've never noticed the car fumes.  I am certain that it's due to long term downtown living that has enabled me not to differentiate any longer what is fresh air and what is not.

All types of friendly folk eat here.  From business people, students to out of towners wondering what Bibimbap is.  The restaurant is bright, cheery and no frills.  Kpop plays in the background which of course makes everything more cheery.  In addition, you can tell by the owners that they keep this place spotless.

There's a water cooler/dispenser for you to help yourself from the stacks of bright plastic Ikea tumblers.  Bonus, they always have a bunch of current Korean classifieds (though I don't read Korean), NOW Magazine, GridTO, Metro, etc.

I've taken just about everyone I know to this place and have eaten everything off the menu.  I forgot to mention, their potato salad is so cute and delicious.  Too bad you only get a dallop sized scoop.  But I guess that's what dainty peeps eat.

They deserve my 5 kimchi rating as they hit service, food and atmosphere for a Korean 'faster food' joint on the head."}
{"text":"By far the best Korean restaurant around this area.

There are few Korean restaurants around Yonge and Bloor, but this is definitely the best for me. clean, fast, variety of food. Nice people, good atmosphere. 

It's not big, but not small as well. Always nice and cold. There is a patio as well. You can do combo items and choose from many korean items on the deck. You can order Gamjatang, Bibimbop or Naemg Myun to suit your needs and taste!

Ask them what it is, and they will certainly be kind enough to answer your questions. Pictures will explain what the food is in case you don't know what it is. Be a regular and they will treat you with extra food sometimes which is always good!!!

Good people and good food, reasonable price. I am always happy to be here whether it be lunch or dinner. My recommendation will be Kalbi Box or Dolsot Bibimbop. Hope you enjoy your time there as much as I do :)"}
{"text":"I'm a take-out regular here. When I call, they see the phone ID and they greet me personally haha! I've been coming here for my korean food fix for I'd say about 2 years and ongoing. There are times during the year where I'd visit 2-3 times a week because I can't get enough. 

I come here not only because it's closeby, but because the food is good quality, great portions and their service is hands-down friendly. George, who is the guy behind the counter, is very friendly and is always open for some conversation. He and his wife, the korean lady, both work at this store full-time and will always make you feel at home. They will greet you when you enter and greet you goodbye when you leave. Of course in the korean language : ) 

My go-to meals here are always the Cold Korean Noodles, which is a very healthy alternative to the other take out food around and it comes with a side of kimchi/veggies and a side of chicken. The portion is huge and the whole meal is only for ten dollars. Its a huge portion of black buckwheat noodles, cucumbers, mangoes, sesame, white radish, egg, and hot sauce/vinager. SO HEALTHY. 
My second go-to meal is the Kalbi Combo. It's huge and they give you such a wide assortment of side dishes that you will be so stuffed for 11 dollars. they give you about 8-10 or so pieces of kalbi and it's just so delicious. 
My third go to meal is their Pork Bone Soup. Cheap, filling and really great : ) 

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant and my personal favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.  I went here for a weekday dinner with a friend.  We got the combination platter and the beef stew.  Overall, it was a good experience but not extremely spectacular.  I would try this place again but perhaps the bibimbop next time.

Food: 3/5, the stew was actually very delicious but the combo plate was lacklustre.  The chicken was not as crispy as I would've liked.  

Service: 4/5, very nice couple running the place and service was good too. They were smiling throughout and we felt comfortable.  

Ambience: 3/5, nice little joint with somewhat of a small food court feel. Relatively quiet and kpop playing in the background.

Price: 2/5, this is where I was lost.  It was a bit more pricier than most korean places and it was more on the cheaper version so I couldn't understand the $10+ per meal before tax. It came to around $15 per person which isn't bad but because it felt more food court....not sure about it."}
{"text":"Dolsot Bibimbap: beef, vegetables & fried egg on rice in a stone bowl, traditional korean style, nice crispy bottom layer, love it.
If you're looking for a quick korean fix in the Yonge&Bloor Area, you've got it right here mate."}
{"text":"It was just OK. Nice owners so I wanted to support them but I'm not used to Korean restaurants not giving you the free sides...just ordered their Udon and the price is on part with other Korean restaurants that always provide you with side like kimchi, bean sprouts etc. Udon was OK but the the shrimp and squid was tiny."}
{"text":"If your wanting good, cheap Korean food. This is the place to go.  If your ordering for pick up, call 15-20 minutes ahead, even if they tell you 10 minutes.  The cook is an older lady so she moves a bit slow.  Love the fact they have added more traditional orean dishes to the menu (special menu, i.e. spicy beef soup with noodles and vegetables).  Hope this place stays around.  They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Great Korean restaurant is all that needs to be said. If you want a completely meal, noodles, rice, meat, veggies, etc, etc come here and get it all! It's cheap, it tastes great and it'll fill you up!"}
{"text":"Been there twice and it's cheap considering the location. The food is pretty good too. Definitely will be going back. 

Note: If you're going as a big group of friends, maybe it's not a good idea unless the shop has no other customers."}
{"text":"Their Bone Soup is the most filling, meaty meal you can get in downtown Toronto for under $10. Amazing spicy flavor and meaty goodness throughout! Try it with a side of silver noodles.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Tremendous cheap lunch option.

They have lunch specials which put a HUGE variety of food on your plate. It's quite remarkable and the food seems to be quite healthy. Don't be turned off by the fact that it's a hot table. They are very good at cooking meat and everything is fresh.

Service is very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Really underrated place IMO, based on the gamjatang that I tried today this place easily hits 5 stars in my book, better than the gamjatang they serve at either owl or seor ak san two places that have been highly rated for their coveted gamjatang.

Bibim Q's atmosphere is very casual, it's a small restaurant but the guy at the front was so overwhelmingly friendly and helpful telling me the hours of the restaurant (10-10 if you were wondering, it's not on yelp) and even giving me extra side dishes to bring home with my take out despite saying that it usually wasn't included. 

The side dishes are really simple, just kimchi and bean sprouts but I enjoyed both, their kimchi is reasonably fresh and flavorful, a basic kimchi. Their bean sprouts might be a little bit on the soggy side as they are definitely refrigerated, but savory and also acceptable. 

The star of the dish, the gamjatang was delicious! Slightly viscous broth but it was fiery and hot and just a great depth of umami flavor (not sure if they add MSG or not). Their pieces of pork bone were also excellent \"cuts\" if you can call it taht because they were literally just 90% meat 10 percent bones, there were no potatoes or excess of vegetables but the fact that the gamjatang was loaded with meat made me overwhelmingly happy. 

5  well earned stars for their gamjatang and friendly service!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick, nutritious, and delicious meal, this is the place! All the bibimbaps are so well made with lots and lots of vegetables, you also get kimchi and miso soup on the side. Their pork bone soup is also amazing, even though i expected more veggies in the soup (You get like 5 pieces of pork bone which is so worth the money). The owners are friendly and runs the shop themselves, and they are there every single day so you know the quality is consistent. 

I'm currently addicted."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with most (if not all) of the previous reviewers of Bibimq.  I really don't like it here.  I even made a second visit just to be sure.  

The first visit, I had some sort of combo plate made from the pre-made dishes that they have in their display case.  It was fine I guess, but no better than from a mall food court.  

Second visit, I had the Dolsot Bimimbob ($9 including tax).  This is the bimimbob that is served in the stone bowl with the egg on top.  I normally enjoy this dish very much, but I found Bibimq's version to be pretty bland, and the sauce that they gave me to go with it seemed ketchup-like.

I'm pretty sure that second visit will be the last one for me."}
{"text":"Hi, I'm here to update my review because I've eaten practically everything on the menu at this point. I'm a big fan of Bibim Q's food, but some of their stuff tastes better than others.

Generally the service has always been good here. For some reason they don't allow photos to be taken of the menu (?!) and if you order takeout, they'll just tell you what's on their menu verbally. Which is odd. But never mind this. 

The restaurant itself looks bare and rather un-fun to sit at, so a lot of people just order takeout (as do I). The food always comes quickly and they contain yummy side dishes like kimchi and beansprouts, and they always wrap up the food neatly to ensure the contents don't spill out, which is very thoughtful.

Favorites: Pork Bone Soup, spicy rice cakes, and the combo platter (includes rice, side dishes, choice of meat, glass noodles and vegetables!)
Dislikes: Seafood pancake and bibimbap (the one without the stone bowl)"}
{"text":"The Ajuma in this place is a very kind-hearted, hard working woman who welcomes everyone who eats in her restaurant.  I could live without the pre-prepared stuff (not very original Korean fare) but her kimchi chigaes and dolsot paps are what keep me coming back for more.  This is straightforward, unpretentious, down to earth Korean food (talking about the ttukbegae and dolsot preparations).  I always leave full and satisfied and ready to burst.  Ajuma please cut down on the portions!"}
{"text":"Had and bulgogi and pork bone soup! Service is good and food is cheap and good. 

Convenient location too love the patio area! Its really chill in summer"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pork bone soup (but there was no potatoes inside). Waiter was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever I crave Asian food- very cheap, clean, and authentic. 
I love the owners! They are extremely accommodating and friendly. 

Highly recommend: Bibimbap and Pork Bone Soup. Make sure to try their glass noodle sides!
Service: probably one of the fastest Asian restaurants I have been to. Once again, owners are very welcoming. 
Taste: really authentic. No MSG or artificial sauces. 

This is definitely one of the restaurants I frequent on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Think this place is currently a little overrated on Yelp! It's not terrible, but just sayin' ;)

Think of Bibimq as a quick lunch spot and not as a dinner spot. (ie don't bring a date here, especially if you want to get some later, it's not going to impress)

Bibimq is small, can squeeze 15 people inside plus they have a small patio that sits another 6-8. No points awarded for decor. It's set up cafeteria style - you order/pay up front and they bring you out a tray with your food.

It appears to be owned by a cute older Korean couple, but they have hired a creepy old white guy to man the cash and take orders. I happened to be the only cracker eating amongst lots of Asian students at the time I visited, but I suspect at lunch hour it would be a mix.

Back to the food. Strange menu including 6-7 kinds of bibimbap. Dolsot bibimbap with grilled chicken sounded good. $7.95. OK. Wait...WHAT? An EGG on top costs an extra $1??? Doesn't it always come with an egg? Grr

Came out as a reasonably nice dish with one small side of kimchi. 

Nothing special but not a bad lunch choice if you happen to be nearby."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time in my final year of undergrad since I lived so close.  It was my quick fix any time I was in the mood for some tasty Korean.  I remember it being much more tasty back then.  I went recently and wasn't very impressed.  The prices are as I remember, which are very reasonable, but the freshness and flavour of ingredients was lacking.  I ordered the bibimbap and it was very blah.  The service was fast and friendly.  You can think of this place as fast food Korean; good for quick meals and people on the go."}
{"text":"I was downtown and craving Korean food...esp the hot pot.
I thought it was good, not amazing but it did satisfy my craving.  Probably not the best I've ever had but I thought it was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Amazing place -it's cheap and the food is so good. The owners are the most friendly couple and honestly it's one of the things I miss the most about being in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I never noticed this place until a coworker brought me here when we had to work around the corner at Wellesley. Being me, once I saw dolsoht bibimbap I didn't have to look at anything else on the menu. I did notice that they had a chicken version though so I went with that. 

Service was great, the people working there are really sweet. They make you get your own water, Korean-style, which is totally fine by me. 

The chicken dolsoht bibimbap came with a side of kimchi, which tasted good by my standards (I used to be a kimchi snob when I first came back from Korea but it's toned down a lot since ^^ ), and soup. The bibimbap came nicely crackling which is a good sign. I pushed aside the toppings so I could smush more of the rice onto the side of the bowl. 

The toppings in the bibimbap were the disappointment for me. It was a lot of pickled radish, then mung bean sprouts, and spinach. I don't mind some pickled radish but I think their pickled radish ratio is way off and turns the taste of the dish. Also soy bean sprouts are way better than mung bean sprouts and is what I usually expect from Korean places. There was plenty of chicken in the dish and the sunnyside up egg was executed perfectly. 

The saving grace here was that the rice turned out awesomely crispy all along the bottom and that's a major point for this dish. For a $10 meal, this place is alright and I would come back if I was in the area."}
