{"text":"Wonderful local and family owned ice cream. A great welcoming environment with fun activities for kids and lots of seating. Great outdoor space in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Nice! Ice cream is good too.  Great place to bring the family.  Friendly environment that's happy to serve and answer questions."}
{"text":"Friendly and smiling staff and of course most delicious ice cream ever-especially the toasted hazelnut! We've been here numerous times as a treat and always enjoy it. As other reviewers have mentioned before it is a bit on the expensive side but definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"It's the perfect summer hangout! My husband and I always sit outside on the patio to enjoy the delicious, creamy homemade ice cream! Mouth-watering!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The only complaint I have is the line, and the fact that people will cut in front of you, but it does move along pretty quickly.  The staff is always pleasant and helpful!  I love the fact that you can go on their website and find the ingredients to everything in the place, that's pretty rare when it comes to ice cream shops!"}
{"text":"The best ice cream you'll ever have in your life. The Oreo is delish. Staff is friendly and it's always clean and happy when we go!"}
{"text":"Vegan choices but could be expanded to more than same two. A good treat place but expensive for frequent visits!"}
{"text":"I live in LA where vegan options are as plentiful as traffic delays. This vegan ice cream kills any others that I've had. ALWAYS get the salted caramel. ALWAYS grab a couple extra pretzel sticks, which are free. And always be grateful for Mitchell's. Yum!"}
{"text":"Life-changing.  Hands down the best ice cream I have ever had. They have seasonal bests, such as the amaretto cookie, and regulars, like the Coffee Chocolate Chunk that is amazing."}
{"text":"This is the best place for large portions and many many delicious options. I usually stick to the cookies and cream in a waffle cone option. The handmade waffle cone really makes this a unique treat. The chocolate shake, complete with fresh whipped cream and chocolate shavings is very rich and filling. Seriously so so good. You can't go wrong here. The servers are always pleasant and helpful. Ingredients are from local farms. You can taste the freshness. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"It's good. I like it. The ice cream is homemade and there's lots of flavors. The line is always really long and the chairs are always everywhere-cause the line runs though the dining area. Going here always has to be an event where you know that's mostly what your doing that evening and not anything else.  I dunno. I like their ice cream, but rarely ever feel the hassle is worth it, and would rather spend my time elsewhere."}
{"text":"SWEET MOTHER OF MONKEY MILK AND ALL THINGS THAT ARE RIGHTEOUS AND HOLY IN THIS WORLD. I have lived in Cleveland for 36 years....and I had NEVER tried Mitchell's. What in the hell is wrong with me people? Seriously, I want to slap myself with a wet waffle cone.   This has to be the coolest ice cream shop on the planet. Simple, modern and the interior of this building is B-E-A-utiful! The dome cieling, the train and all the natural light really make this place stand out. Located on Detroit Rd near Costco, this is a great location to be in. Lots of traffic and an area that has really been built up in the past decade. Plenty of parking and easily accessible as well.  Service here was phenomenal. The young girls taking care of us were full of smiles, lots of patience and really made the experience perfect. We tried several (and by several I mean at least 10) flavors and finally settled on the vegan chocolate and the vegan salted pecan. PEOPLE PEOPLE PEOPLE, these flavors changed my life. But beware, they are super sweet. Thank goodness we split them. A little goes a LONG way. It is rare to try vegan ice cream that is creamy and not gritty. They have this down to a science. They were even more creamy than the real thing IMHONSHO (in my humble or not so humble opinion.)   Their mission to use local and well-sourced? ingredients made my heart smile. Not only is the product amazing, but the mission behind it is as well. We will DEFINITELY be back. WOW!"}
{"text":"Two local guys with a passion for fresh ice cream and innovative flavors have made this one of my favorite places to go for dessert. I've been to the Mitchell's in Rocky River and Westlake so I decided to stop here last night after a dinner out with friends in Avon Lake. Like it's other stores, the place is bright and clean with smiling young faces behind the counter eager to take my order. $3.50 for a single scoop might seem a bit much, but it's well worth it - and for the quality of the product you get, it's a bargain."}
{"text":"First time here. Ice cram was great with lots of flavors. Had cones, but will try a sundae next time. Just a little expressive: 2 double scoop comes were over &10.00."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place was packed when we walked in, but they tend to keep the line moving along very well. The employees seem to have their stuff together and are very with the program. They even keep the dinning area up to par for how busy it happened to be."}
{"text":"This was the best ice cream we've ever had!!  And it was served by a friendly and helpful staff. We liked that there is an option on the menu called \"Taster's Trio\" so we could try 3 different flavors (and we were expecting mini scoops but they were big scoops!).  Great variety of ice cream flavors and a large and clean seating area with free self-serve water.  We wish we lived in the area so we could return more often!"}
{"text":"This is a must try! My husband and I have never had a flavor here we haven't loved. We usually get the taster's trio to try as many seasonal flavors as possible before they're gone. If you do the taster's duo or trio you do have to make sure to choose flavors that work well together, but we've each only had one combination that didn't work. The wildberry crumble is both of our favorites, but you really can't go wrong. The Avon location is the only Mitchell's we've been to, but I imagine they're all delicious. Service is also very quick, which is good since we've only been there one time when they weren't busy. Still, service is so quick that it doesn't take long to get your order."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious ice cream I've ever had in my life. I got a peanut butter fudge sundae with toasted hazelnut ice cream. The ice cream isn't overly sweet, it's just right. The peanut butter sauce and fudge sauce were both delectable. And it was enough for at least 2, maybe even 3 people to share. And at a reasonable cost too. I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"The best ice cream I have ever eaten. My favorite is chocolate peanut butter. My only complaint is that when I buy the take home containers the chocolate peanut butter shares the same label with the chocolate peanut butter chunk which I do not like which we have mistakenly bought BLAH  so I wish they would change the labels but other than that no complaints!! LOVE MY MITCHELLS YUM!!"}
{"text":"All Mitchell's are my favorite, don't take for granted what you have until it's gone-moved out of cle and lived in cbus and chi and nothing compares, have to get it every time I'm home! And no shakes compare to theirs with the fresh chocolate shavings!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended quality love ice cream excellent, large varieties to choose from, has a beautiful outside patio, cleanliness above-average, personnel friendly and helpful. Extremely busy always convenient and easily accessed from Road and large shopping area.."}
{"text":"One of the only places that makes their ice cream locally. Me and my family enjoy going to this restaurant once a month. The service is always great and fast. The establishment is always clean. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because the ice cream flavor could be improved."}
{"text":"Very good flavor, texture, and service.  We keep going back again and again.  A train, too!"}
{"text":"The ice cream is good and the people nice. Sadly it's a bit too loud inside. So if you're there with family you end up having to yell. And they don't clean up the tables and floors as quickly as you'd hope.    Wish people visiting weren't so sloppy.  Cause it's a nice place."}
{"text":"Deliciousness in a cone. Has yet to disappoint. Perfect cool treat on a hot day. Stopped in today for my \"passed microbiology summer class\" reward and it was mmm good!"}
{"text":"Mitchell's is the best of the best. This has to be the best ice cream place in the country. I've lived in three other states since moving out of Ohio and traveled quite a bit. I can confidently say that Mitchell's is the best ice cream out there. Close your eyes and point at a flavor because it'll be the best you've had. They have a really large selection for a shop that makes such unique flavors. My current favorites are campfire s'mores and lavender. I've also fancied the bing cherry chocolate chunk which has generous chunks of delicious chocolate in it. For my husband's birthday party I picked up two cakes here and they were the bomb. Six months later my grandma was still talking about those cakes. I feel sorry for people that have never had Mitchell's ice cream."}
{"text":"After being to all the Mitchell's locations, this one is my second favorite (have to rank the OHC factory #1 of course). Beautiful building that has a good amount of seating indoors and out which is nice conceding this place is packed during summer nights.   Best ice cream I've ever had, and I've had a lot; quality is consistently great. No ice chunks in this ice cream! Smooth and creamy with fresh/local ingredients. Tons of permanent flavors with lots of rotating seasonal flavor. What could be better?! Keep it up!!  PS I recommend the tasters duo/trio for if you want to try a couple different flavors in one sitting"}
{"text":"Usually Mitchell's is pretty good.  Since it's the holiday season I decided to try the Christmas Ale ice cream.  I love Great Lakes Christmas Ale.  I mean what Clevelander doesn't!  This ice cream was no comparison to our favorite holiday beer.  It started off ok but then it went south.  Some crazy terrible after taste that 2 bites of my wife's chocolate PB couldn't shake.  Will definately skip that one next time..."}
{"text":"We are what you would consider regulars at Mitchell's. The Avon store is within walking distance, but unfortunately the mileage walked does not equal the calories consumed (most of the time!). On to the ice cream review: We have tried just about every single flavor and our favorites are: Caramelized Chocolate, Toasted Hazelnut (tastes a lot like Nutella!), S'Mores, Blue Cosmo, Coconut and Peach. To be honest, there is not a flavor we haven't liked though. The store is immaculately clean, the service is smiley and helpful, they offer unlimited samples and the patio is fabulous. If you haven't tried it yet, you should. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If great ice cream and creative flavors are not enough, the homemade whipped cream and cherries top it off. It's also nice to see they use local ingredients when they can. The staff is very friendly, not to mention patient. There is so much to choose from!"}
{"text":"The ice cream was fantastic (caramelized chocolate and cherry chocolate chunk), but the waffle cone was relatively soft/stale."}
{"text":"This is what an ice cream shop should be.   The quality is amazing. Every flavor I've ever had had simply tasted exactly what it suggests--Key Lime Pie is one of my personal favorites as it hits the flavor perfectly, and adds delicious texture variation with graham cracker pieces.   All of their ice creams are made just a little ways away locally, and menu items marked with M100 have ingredients solely in a radius of 100 miles from Ohio City.   Plenty of space to eat in and relax, indoor or outdoor on the patio. Great atmosphere, especially for kids who can take advantage of the paper and crayons to doodle their hearts out."}
{"text":"How is this place not an international ice cream conglomerate already!? Seriously, this is my favorite kind of ice cream. It's so clearly made in-house and they have an amazing variety of choices. And FREE pretzel sticks! Whaaaat? To the owners: please open a shop in Washington DC stat!"}
{"text":"Great selection of different ice cream. Their specialties are neat as well. Inside or outside seating. Don't be discouraged by lines, any length moves quickly. Friendly teenagers working. Not the cheapest but definitely not outrageous. 6 people got ice cream for $25 bucks"}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus how does this place only have 3 reviews?! It is a beacon of delicious dairy in the Cleveland suburbs.  Why so delightful? Let me count the ways...  1. The staff are sunny & sweet. No stink eye if you need to try a bunch of flavors before deciding on your selection(s).   2. Quality 'scream in creative but not ridiculous flavors. You'll find tasty combos, especially in the seasonal varieties like Wildberry Crumble, Carmelized Chocolate, and Cherry Stout, in addition to their classics that are sure to impress. The Wildberry Crumble and Mint Cookie are a few of my personal favorites.   3. Portion sizes are pretty generous. One scoop is the size of a (small) softball.   4. Per their website: \"Fresh, local, wholesome. Farm-fresh dairy, grass-fed and raised on family farms in the countryside of Holmes and Wayne Counties an hour away. Local seasonal fruits. The finest organic vanillas and arabica coffees. Locally-roasted nuts. Belgian, Swiss, & Dutch chocolates.\" I like all of these things.   5. Super clean store & patio with the cutest train rolling around the interior perimeter.   There may not be too much around this Mitchell's, but with ice cream this awesome, I could care less. Oh, and I hear the birthday ice cream cakes are host a brownie foundation. Best. Decision. Ever."}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favorite ice cream shop! From taste to service, they get it right every time. They claim to use fresh, all-natural, local ingredients and it shows in the flavors and taste of their ice creams. They have a roster of always available flavors along with rotating seasonal selections. They offer free samples to aid in choosing your order and their servings are large and filling.  Some of my favorite flavors include pumpkin (seasonal), cinnamon (seasonal), mint chocolate chip (always available), and pralines & cream (always available). Their caramel sea salt is the best I've ever had!  They have many locations which include Avon, Ohio City, and Rocky River. I've never had better ice cream anywhere!"}
{"text":"High-quality ice cream.  Nearly as good as Graeter's in Cincinnati. The chocolate and chip flavors I have tried are outstanding. The Butter Pecan is sublime! I got the Cinnamon yesterday and it was the first flavor that disappointed me. It really did not have a spicy cinnamon-forward flavor. Very mild. Tasted maybe nutmeg or cardamom in it????  Not sure. Anyway, one bad scoop won't keep me away from this Cleveland diamond!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Mitchell's. Flavors are unique and filled with ingredients. I do think it is a bit expensive compared to similar places - Handel's to be specific. I ordered a milkshake with caramelized chocolate ice cream. It was perfect. Delicious flavor and a great consistency for a shake. It was topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings and was overall just divine."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the atmosphere and I love their ice cream. The entire place is so clean and that staff was so friendly.   We both ordered the No Sugar Added, Fat Free Vanilla and it was actually really delicious. I really recommend at least trying it.   I can't wait to have their ice cream again."}
{"text":"Super expensive and always a long wait. Wish they had a butter pecan with bigger pecans."}
{"text":"Really great ice cream! Our group was comparing it to Penn State Creamery in PA and we felt Mitchell's was better, hands down.  I had the pistachio. It had a great pistachio flavor, without tasting artificial. I was also able to try a few other flavors and every one of them was great.  If you're in the area and don't stop, you are doing yourself a disservice. :)"}
{"text":"Mitchell's is a Cleveland classic! What's not to like?  The Avon location is great!  It's very clean with plenty of seating both inside and outside.  The parking lot is a bit small, but there's plenty of extra parking behind the building by the old Bar 145. The workers at this location are awesome...super friendly and they keep the line moving quickly.  Mitchell's ice cream is made fresh at their Ohio City factory using local ingredients.  I've never had a flavor that I didn't like, but my go-tos are the Key Lime Pie, Banana Cream Pie, and the Vegan Salted Caramel Pecan.  Their seasonal flavors are fantastic too! At $3.75 for a single scoop, prices are reasonable."}
