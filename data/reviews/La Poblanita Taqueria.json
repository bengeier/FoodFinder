{"text":"Yummy tacos!! I got 1 chicken and 1 chorizo taco. The chicken was spicy and tangy and the chorizo had a lot of flavor! They also have a nice selection of toppings to put on your taco, and best of all they're free. I put their hot sauce and guacamole on my tacos, and wow they are amazing! I'm really glad that I stopped here for lunch in the mall and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"La Poblanita has an assortment of tacos, burritos & quesadillas with 6 choices of fillings (vegetables, chicken, chorizo, asada, Lomo, carnitas.  There is a topping bar with hot sauces, salsa and some cilantro.  
I think this must be associated with the La Poblanito in Coraopolis but not sure.  The Tacos are about $.50 more expensive at this location which is in the food court at The Mall at Robinson."}
{"text":"This place kept popping up on yelp, and I was at the mall today, so I wanted to finally try it. I got a bowl with rice, meat, and all of the toppings that I could ever want. I love that you can serve yourself for the toppings and have as much or as little as you'd like, including sour cream and guacamole. I also got Horchata, and both of those things together plus tax came to less than 10 bucks. The only reason this is getting four stars instead of five is because I would have liked the food to be a little bit hotter, temperature-wise."}
