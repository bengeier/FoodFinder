{"text":"For a $10+ burger, I expect better than a white bread bun.  The perogies were delicious though.  It's a very quiet atmosphere, and I frequently felt like I was making people uncomfortable with my louder than average voice."}
{"text":"Needing a break from the food at the West Side Market and since none of the 10 restaurants on W25 are open for lunch (seriously, what the hell?) we had decided to go to Heck's.  Upon entering I was thrown into a claustrophobic nightmare, smashed like a window cling against a beer cooler that's right by the entrance.  Well played, Heck's, I see you have Christmas ale.  The place itself is pretty tiny.  I can't imagine what it is like when the entire house is full.  We were seated in the back, the greenhouse room, which was nice.  Myself and my dining partner each got coffee and burgers.  Their signature coffee is outstanding.  It was so good that I was considering spending $12 on a pound of it to take home with me.  Unfortunately, by the end of the meal I was so incredibly food drunk that I was lucky I remembered where the car was.  I was in shock when we got our burgers.   They were massive.  I think mine literally cast a shadow on the table it was so big.  I got the one with bacon, egg, and a softball-sized glob of sour cream.  The first bite was heaven, the last one was hell.  The fries were really good, but many of them were left behind. When you're dealing with grease and egg yolk you have to make quick decisions about what gets eaten because you know it's not going to keep/be good reheated.  The burgers were very delicious.  My suggestion is to get the # burger instead of the  1/2#, seeing as how there's an additional one and a half pounds of toppings.  If you've never experienced \"meat sweats\", you will if you finish a burger from this place."}
{"text":"I graduated St. Ignatius in 1967 and Heck's used to be Ray's. At lunch it was packed with students and everybody had a burger and fries. Been in Cali since 1968 and haven't been back but it sounds and looks like both the food and environs have been upgraded and the spirit lives on.  

Go Tribe, beat Chicago!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, gluten free options. Creative cocktails. Fries with different dip options were really good. Not pretentious."}
{"text":"Always satisfied with the food from Heck's. I must say that if you come here, you have to try the milkshakes. They are amazing. I had the peanut butter chocolate milkshake and it left me wanting to order another one! (I wish I did) I also got the Cajun burger which was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile. I must say they have amazing food and the staff was very nice to us. I will be heading there again as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries!  Atmosphere could use an update - rather plain and outdated!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for something different and Bam...a grass fed beef burger landed in front of me.  Poor thing ..it didn't stand a chance. Although it's moment was short lived the memories will last a lifetime. I'm hooked and there's no rehab in the world to take care of this addiction."}
{"text":"This place was a favorite restaurant of mine back when I was a teen and twentysomething, which was some years ago, okay, some decades ago, back when coming to this historic residential neighborhood to eat was a bit adventurous.  \"Adventurous\" being code for \"don't get mugged\", but it is nothing like that around Heck's now.  I'm happy to see that as the area has improved, Heck's has stayed in business, aged rather well and still does the burger and fries as well as it used to.  (I seem to recall the fries, like my body, may have been a little skinnier back in the day, but they still have the same great taste.)  They do serve various other things, but burgers and fries in my opinion were and are the main selling point.   

The plant-decorated Garden Room has a nice California feel, and is where you want to eat if you're not eating on the patio (not really feasible in January).  The back wall has been repainted from the light color I remember to an adobe pueblo shade of orangish, making it seem a bit darker in there.  It's still cozy and goes well with the tile floor.  There are also several booths in the hall leading back to the dining room, The booth area could use some jazzing up - I seem to remember more Tiffany glass, and how about some art work on the wall?  

On a recent visit, there were quite a few tables eating even though it was (a) Super Bowl Sunday and (b) a few inches of snow were on the ground outside  I had the Ohio City Burger, which is basically a half pound of meat with herbs and mozz, and my husband had the Cajun Burger because he loves cajun spiced everything.  The burgers came with fries and the only minor beef I had was they didn't ask if we wanted ketchup or aioli with them, but no matter as the fries here are and have always been so good that you don't really need to dip 'em.  The coffee here hasa definite cinnamon flavor.  Service was just fine and best of all the restaurant had a quiet atmosphere - there was music playing in the background but very very softly, and there were no crowds of drunk people talking too loud and monkeying with their iPhones all night, or loud little kids.  Price was around 20 bucks (one of us had an alcoholic drink) which to me is reasonable for a sit-down restaurant that's a leg up from a diner or a bar.  Although we didn't have time to sit with a bottle of wine on this particular evening, this is a great place to do it and the wine list is nice.

If you're looking for a trendy foodie hot spot with lots of crazy exciting Food Network stuff on the menu, this place is probably not going to be your bag.  However, if you are instead looking for a quaint, off the beaten path (it's a ways away from the W. 25th bar and restaurant strip) place with a good long history,  to eat a great burger and fries and maybe a milkshake or a beer, that is not a bar but still has a reasonably adult, \"casual restaurant\" atmosphere, then definitely go.   I hope this place stays around for decades to come."}
{"text":"A must if you are visiting Cleveland. The food and atmosphere are fantastic. The drinks are great as well!"}
{"text":"Got a table on a Friday night at about 8pm and was seated almost immediately.  Waitstaff was attentive and had our first round of drinks out pretty quickly.  Ordered the beet salad, lobster mac & cheese, and the shrimp and grits.  The orange beet salad was a solid salad and have to admit I was very tempted to lick the plate once I was finished.  The mac & cheese was, as expected, rich, gooey, decadent...everything you're looking for in a mac & cheese.  The shrimp and grits were okay.  I'm from the south and grits are my jam.  I felt they fell a bit short but I still ate the crap out of it. I will definitely be back. With a designated driver."}
{"text":"Everything is great! Prices are just right, the food is well prepared & looks great! The bar is brand new and looks great. Very unique."}
{"text":"My first visit was last week for brunch, and I have to say I am impressed. I went on a date, and we started off with the lamb moon pies- to die for ! I love lamb ( good lamb) and I will keep going back just to eat the lamb moon pies! I ordered the BBQ burger, and my date ordered the prime rib burger. Both were very good, tasty, and full of flavor! The fries are a little weak with flavor and crispiness. 

NOTICE**** The temperature of the burgers were both off. Personally, medium temp for a burger is the best. I have not been to many burger places in town ( east or west) that cook your burger at the right temp ( which is quite ridiculous if you ask me). I am not sure if all these places just have a bunch of young underpaid line cooks or \"chefs\", but something needs to be done across the board. The only place you will get a fully medium burger so far, is at Luckys cafe in Tremont ( Luckys is a brunch breakfast place). 

The desert menu has some delicious options ! We choose the brownie burger, which is a brownie with vanilla ice cream, in between two huge chocolate chip cookies and waffle fries! Very Very very good stuff! also be prepared to be very full, the portion is huge! 

The service was good. Just nice standard service, nothing bad and nothing great."}
{"text":"Went to Heck's Cafe because of other reviews that talked about their great burgers. Came away disappointed because of the other reviews. Burgers weren't bad, but they weren't off the charts like others claimed. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here expecting a life-changing burger."}
{"text":"I have not been to Heck's in well over a year, and have always enjoyed it in the past. I WILL NOT GO BACK. Today, my chicken Caesar salad came out and not only looked unappealing, but was inedible. The chicken was old and chewy, the lettuce was less than fresh and the dressing was not Caesar. I have never sent food back in my life...I am 27 years old and did it for the first time today. To add to the negative experience, it took well over 45 minutes for our server to ask how we were doing and then looked astonished when I told him about the salad. He also did not split our bill, amongst the five people at our table, and then when we asked him to do so, he would not.... then proceeded to blame us for not asking in the first place. As someone who works in the industry....It is my job to ask about the bill situation. Not to blame it on the guests. Overall, just a bad experience."}
{"text":"While Yelp reviewers seem to really dislike Heck's, another rating site is filled with praises for the place.  I wasn't going to take a risk, but our intended other option had a long wait and burgers seem more appropriate anyway for Father's Day.  I think I figured out why the rating discrepancies - expectation.  If you expect the best burger you ever ate and perfect service you will HATE Heck's.  If you expect a decent meal you'll really like it.  I rated \"meh, I've experienced better\" because I have.  Our family of 4 ate outside at about 1 pm. We ordered 4 burgers, one French toast and 1 iced tea. The bill after tax was $50.50.  The Ohio burger had a myriad of indiscernible herbs. The Rogue burger had a sour cream topping with some blue cheese crumbled in.  The other (?) burger had mushrooms & swiss.  Although we ordered two medium \"but please be sure there's pink in mine\" and one medium well, all 3 came out the same - no red, some pink.  None of us finished them. The baklava French toast was good, but doesn't live up to its name. It's French toast with sugar in the dip and a few walnut halves dropped on the plate. I had one bite that was tasty, but squishy/raw in the center. We did finish that plate, though.  The fries were very similar to Five Guys, but less salt.  Our water and tea ran out, and we waited inordinately long for the check even after the waiter knew we were finished.  We enjoyed ourselves and ate a decent meal. Doubt we'll go back, though."}
{"text":"I, soooo strongly, do not recommend this restaurant. After THREE attempts to get TWO sandwiches i was finally able to get the wrong order again. When calling the restaurant to get the right order through. I was met with a very professional, very well trained scoffing and laughing hostess. I wasnt aware that cooking burgers, or at least getting an order down over the phone was something us plebeians would not understand. Horrible customer service, horrible kitchen staff. This place was once a great part of this neighborhood, but not anymore."}
{"text":"We had dinner on a Sunday evening. The service was excellent and the food was tasty.  There's a wide variety of food on the menu. I feel like some items are priced a bit too high, but there are many different options, so don't let that stop you. In nice weather there is outdoor seating available. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Heck's for lunch recently.  The burger didn't live up to the hype.

The atmosphere was good.  The inside of the restaurant is very spacious with excellent natural lighting.  There was also clean and well organized outdoor seating.  Our server that day was courteous and efficient.

I had the burger au poivre (with grilled onions, sour cream).  The meat was dry, and I was underwhelmed by its flavor.  For a menu item that was supposed to be adventurous, the burger was very bland.  The combination of unseasoned hamburger meat and sour cream didn't taste fun or surprising.

My girlfriend had the tuna steak.  She thought it was meaty but didn't go with rye bread or its nondescript mayonnaise sauce.  She asked for a sauce with more tang and was offered mayonnaise with horseradish, mayonnaise with cranberry, mayonnaise with ...

The ketchup at Heck's was served in tiny individual glass bottles.  I didn't like the rationing of condiments and thought it was a waste of glass.

I did enjoy the Cajun fries.  I won't be back but would recommend Heck's to someone looking for a mayonnaise based meal."}
{"text":"don't get the aioli fries or the sweet hamburger. You may just die in ECSTASY! We also had the avocado caprese which is a very flavorful take on the traditional Italian favorite.  Lobster mac n cheese is also so very tasty!  the staff is friendly and efficient.  Cute, clean place to dine if you are in Ohio City.  Near the main drag in OC. Three blocks from the West Market."}
{"text":"If you havent tried this place yet- YOU SHOULD! 

Their balsamic chicken is to die for and i have done just to get their side salad because their apricot vinaigrette is the best thing i have ever tasted!  The restaurant is small and cute and the dining area feels like your eating in a greenhouse. The patio is awesome too. The staff is great and friendly. 

The worst thing i have ever experienced there was another couple and  I were on our way late on a weeknight and they had closed an hour early because they were slow.  We had to eat at great lakes and it wasnt nearly as good."}
{"text":"Best burgers & fries in Ohio City! Breakfast on Sunday is another must here. Salads are also very tasty. Their falafel burger is awesome. Illy is the BEST waiter in Cleveland area. Very attentive and always there when you need refill. They have their own special blend of coffee that is absolutely delicious. Love to eat there!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always enjoy my meal. The braised short rib was especially delicious!"}
{"text":"I hate giving Hecks anything other then 5 stars , in the past the burgers have truly been the best I have ever had.  Unfortunately last night was not the case , my very thin over Cook pattie with not even a tea spoon of braised short rib and clump of arugula with zero dressing on it left my husband and myself speechless on such a drastic change from over the dozen or so times we both have ordered this burger. If it was my first time ever going I would never have gone back , way to many places to eat. I hope this was a hugh blunder and not how they plan to execute in the future.    Hecks we truly enjoy your food and the setting is perfect . Please ditch that pattie ."}
{"text":"Blah. Went in for brunch, server was efficient but that was it, no personality, food was ok, decor was shabby."}
{"text":"We were really disappointed in the food.  The appetizers and entrees arrived cold.  Even the melted cheese on the burgers was hard.  They are famous for their burgers, but this time it was not worth the trip and the money we spent."}
{"text":"Well here is a story for the ages. My flight from NJ got delayed and I finally arrived downtown at my hotel. I searched yelp and came upon Hecks  and realized they were still open and relatively close. My hotel called a taxi and I thought I would be at the restaurant by 8:45. 8;45 came and my taxi was not here so I called Heck and spoke with Christina and told her my situation. I decide to order a burger not wanting to miss the 9pm kitchen closing. Christina assured me the selection of the Cajun Burger was good choice and now I waited for my cab. and waited. at 9:05 Christina - called me back on my cell phone asking what the story was. I explained I was running late - she was already trying to figure out how to get my Cajun burger to me downtown!!!!! She was funny and awesoem to deal with. Just then my cab showed up and got me to Hecks  and Christina gave me my burger. Since it was now 9:30, I returned to the hotel and while a little cold from the taxi delays, this was an awesome Cajun burger. The sauteed onions really made it and the meal hit the spot. I am huge fan of Hecks and look forward to retuning and sitting proper next time with a pint of beer to enjoy my next burger. Thank Christina - nice job."}
{"text":"I had kind of forgotten about Hecks for a while until I saw that it had new management. I went in and had the tuna burger and it was excellent! I will definitely be back more often now."}
{"text":"Beautiful lunch atrium room, tight space but bright colors and foliage. Love eating in the back room. Awesome malt vinegar aioli sauce and French fries. All the burgers are amazing. 

I prefer to go for lunch but I heard dinner there is good too. I also got a Bloody Mary with bacon-infused vodka... Couldn't really taste the bacon though."}
{"text":"They are open until 10pm, not 9 like the information says. All lies! We arrived about 845 and seated right away in the really nice, open, sun dining room...or whatever it's called. To preface the service, I really don't know what it was...she seemed more focused on getting whatever closing list she has than prompt and attentive service. Took a bit to actually figure out who our server would be. 

Wanted to see what the burgers were all about, so we ordered two Heck Burgers both medium, and both with cheese. She explained the temp as being a true(?) medium in that it would be pink. Yeah, well, it better be then! I would have like to have seen a list of all available toppings you could add to the Heck Burger, or any other for that matter. Also tried the Nutella shake, which was pretty good and actually tasted like Nutella....unlike the shitty restaurant The Rail.

So we waited, and the wait was reasonable. What was really odd was a different server brought the shake out...then that same server brought our burgers...then, when I had an issue with our order not being right we had to resort to that SAME guy server after sitting awkwardly at the table wondering when she would maybe follow up and ask how everything was so we could point things out...NOPE! At no point did our original waitress come back until after starting to eat to ask if more water was needed....no, even though our glasses are near empty and I am 1/4 done with my plate I don't see why we could need more water....ugh, geez.

The issue with the order was simply not getting any cheese I had requested. Our NOT server offered to have cheese put on, but I really didn't mind it without cheese. As long as I didn't get charged then it's fine by me.

So yeah, other than the no cheese the burger was ok. It was cooked perfectly, no complaints there. Seems more like a 1/3 pound as opposed to the 1/2 pound as shown on the menu. The bun was fantastic though, whatever it was. Fries were cooked great and had a nice crisp. The burgers were just OK, not the best so Scene says. Maybe I need to choose the more adventurous burger options like the cheval or something with other obscure toppings to REALLY have something to base if it comes to being considered as the best or not? Who knows.

I wasn't blown away by anything, especially the service. Nice girl, just not sure if her attention was focused on a break, any closing work, or what. Hardly ever saw her other than the one water refill and receiving the check. Kind of feel bad giving her as much as I did as a tip and nothing to the NOT server who did most of the work for her. Hope they share tips...."}
{"text":"The  soup was cold and my salad was rotten. This place is usually great. They must have been having a bad day or something."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot, it's really nice inside. I had the bagel and lox which was amazing."}
{"text":"Recently went to Heck's for Sunday brunch.  We were seated promptly even though we did not have reservations.   Food was fine, decent selection.   However, it was crowded and they had one server working the entire back portion of the restaurant.  She was server and bartender.  Service was terrible.  It wasn't her fault.....no one would be able to keep up.   Hire some more people!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I went for lunch. The space is nice but thats about it. The food was terrible. We started out with a crab cake that was cold. We decided to share a burger and \"country fried steak\". Both were cold. Its not even country fried steak. It was ground beef dropped in a deep fryer. Wont be back.Very dissapointing."}
{"text":"Nice family environment, a little dark inside but overall great food. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening at Heck's Cafe. Great burgers and fries, , attentive and courteous service, good bar selections, good atmosphere... all at a price you can afford. This is restaurant I definitely will go back to."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the french onion soup, the stock needed some flavor.  the chicken paprikash soup was too thick, felt like I was eating a thick paste.  The salad with ginger dressing was very nice."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for Sunday brunch.  Enjoyed myself each time!

If you want to keep it to basic stuff, they have all the brunch staples for a reasonable price.  If you feel like treating yourself or getting a little fancy... they have some more unique dishes that are slightly more expensive.  I've spent anywhere from $15 to $35 here on brunch.

The patio is great!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? The service, despite being exceptional, was completely overshadowed by the amazing food. I ordered the market burger and it exceeded already high expectations. This is a must visit for anyone who loves a good feed"}
{"text":"Market burger was one of the best burgers I have ever had. And I don't make that statement lightly. Some of the other \"new and upcoming\" restaurants get all the pub, and glam, but Hecks is definetly worth the trip. Great burgers, great fries (try the malt vinegar aioli) great service."}
{"text":"Well known for their delicious burgers and fries, this restaurant never disappoints! We sat in the back garden room which was well lit and perfect. The burgers were cooked to perfection and we always leave full. One of our favorite stops!"}
{"text":"In town visiting from Chicago, I will highly recommend this place to any visitors to Cleveland.  The food was excellent, as was the service.  Our server, Rachel, was very cool and poured a good beer. The staff was very friendly and the outdoor seating was great.  The burger I had was perfect, from the garnish to the quality of the grass fed beef.  My fiance had the linguini with peas, bacon and garlic chips. Not heavy at all, and very flavorful.  Last but not least, their coffee and cocktails were awesome.  I take my coffee black, and it was the perfect brew for that.  It reminded me of cafe de olla, but not as sweet.  My bourbon/ginger cocktail was perfectly balanced as was my fiances bloody Mary.  If you're from \"the Land\", go there!!  If you're visiting, tear yourself away from downtown and pay Heck's Cafe a visit.  I'm sure it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"First time visit for dinner on Saturday before the Brite Winter Festival.  I thought they might be extra busy since they were offering 20% off for festival mugs, but we were seated without a wait.  I enjoyed the plant filled back room's relaxed feeling.  My husband and I split the Basque and Cajun burgers.  We ordered both burgers medium, but one came out rare and the other well done.  It wasn't a big deal to us, and we were both pleased with the meal and the service.   Both burgers had tons of cheese on them, and we thought the buns were exceptionally good."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group and very high expectations, including one of the best burgers in Cleveland.  I found the service to be a bit slow, although we were a big group so I won't ding them on that. My main gripe is that I ordered my burger medium rare and it came medium well if not well done.  I can't really give them more than 3 stars because of that."}
{"text":"Good Value, Great Service, and AMAZING FOOD! I honestly think that they have the best burgers in the Cleveland area and beat Bspot or the rail BY FAR!!!!  This little restaurant is like a hidden gem in Cleveland and I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Initially, I was trying to go around the corner to another place. Since there was no parking and it was raining, we decided to try this place out. We went in around noon on a Sunday for brunch and we were seated right away. The place was clean, the crowd was mostly older people, but they seemed cool.

I started with a pineapple and grey goose (stop judging) and my bff had the hot cocoa and whipped cream. My cocktail was actually really yummy and my bff's hot cocoa was average. 

I was really tempted to go with a burger, but I was in the mood for lighter fare. She went with the waffles, they had berries (just OK, not something she would order again). Although, the bacon which came with it was really delish. Stand out bacon, for sure. I went with the salmon with hollandaise sauce. It was served with scrambled eggs (for cheese-less scrambled eggs I thought they were above average). The salmon and sauce was really good, but I was really disappointed with the portion size. Maybe a 2 ounce fillet (not kidding), for $13 it could have been a little bigger. The fried potatoes were fine.

Here's my complaint, first time dining somewhere in a long time where I cleaned my plate and I was still hungry when I left. Half the plate was filled with garnish (orange and cantaloupe), not cool. If I wanted fruit, I would have ordered it. All in all, $25 for one drink and a 2 ounce salmon fillet (before tip) $30 after tip. Too much? I'd say so. The service wasn't bad, but I wouldn't dine here if your in a hurry. The food wasn't bad at all, but there is a better value to be had in the area."}
{"text":"I've been going here since high school, through college and now well into adulthood.  I've never been disappointed.  My regular item has been the Rocky River Burger and I highly recommend it, but anytime I've ever had anything besides the burger I've been pleased. I recently brought a friend who travels the country there for lunch and he was eminently satisfied by his food. My only complaint is that with the switch in ownership we no longer get the tiny ketchup bottles for our fries."}
{"text":"Dined there on a Friday night after hearing good reviews from acquaintances about their great burgers.

Was very disappointed. The burgers were cold, over cooked and lacking in flavor. Totally lackluster. Not to mention that the service was awful.

Our beverages and appetizers came out promptly but then had to wait an hour for 2 burgers and a plate of ravioli to come out. I think the server forgot about the rest of our dinner. 

Could have made a better dinner at home for a lot le$$ in much less time. Sorry."}
{"text":"I remember when Heck's was good, and I remember when Heck's was bad.  When it was good, it was very very good.  Ohio City, the neighborhood where Heck's is located, was just beginning to revive its fortunes when I first dined at Hecks.  I remember a great meal with several friends that led to repeat visits.

Hecks permanently fell from grace when I took a new beau there for dinner.  The service was slapdash, the food was all messed up, but the nadir of the evening was when a cockroach the size of a large ladies' brooch crawled gingerly out of my salad.  I complained, and the waiter whisked it away and brought me another salad.  Yuck.  No mention of comping the meal.  My appetite was gone, the dinner was a disaster, and our evening sank along with it.

I hope Heck's has revived itself because the atmosphere and the location were always top notch."}
{"text":"I was transported down the 1970s memory lane with my father. I can see, in foodie terms, why this place has lasted so long. 

While he was nostalgic over his residency in the 1970s at Lutheran Hospital and coming here to Heck's Cafe as an occasional treat on tight budget, I was analyzing the 'heck' out of it. While it
has an unassuming entrance, like a seemly small diner, it's much larger on the inside (think of the Tardis). With vivid green plants on a spiral staircase and an interesting folk-style tile on the floor, it truly carries the ambiance of the neighborhood. 

We were greeted by a pleasant hostess, who was finishing up a to-go order. We were, then, speedily led to a table in the center of the complex (where it looked like two buildings were conjoined). Our view was a combination of green reaching plants on said spiral staircase and of the main bar that had the Olympics on full visual blast. 

After we we seated, I was figuring out my order. The charmingly slender dark-haired gentlemen that served us was both very attentive and helpful.

Since I had a large breakfast, I opted for soup and salad (The Soup of the day: Mushroom & Leek Soup and their Orange & Beet Salad). Both were very tasteful and filling. I feel like I should have opted for one of the other. The Mushroom and Leek soup was extremely savory and elegant in its ceramic planter-like bowl. And the salad was amazingly modernly fresh with its goat cheese/ walnut / beet / seedless orange glory. I've never felt so content with a salad before and it really hit the spot.

It genuinely was like a party of leafy greens in my mouth. I think the fresh goat cheese helped create the flavorful ambiance.

My father opted for their \"Heckburger\" with cheese and bacon. He was really \"down memory lane\" when he was eating that burger. I can't describe it. It's like reliving something from childhood/ early adulthood but without words. He told me the burger was exactly like dining on beef from Argentina. 

***Side note: My father is originally from Paraguay but he has family from Argentina. So, he know what he is talking about.*** 

I tried a bit of his burger. It wasn't dry or \"tasteless\" but gloriously moist and really fulfilled my Umami tastebuds. 

Towards the end of our visit, I had a beer (Great Lakes... Can't remember the name) at the bar area. We had two choices for the Olympics to watch, Volleyball (USA vs Japan) or Synchronized swimming (I believe it was Canada?) for tv entertainment. We opted for volleyball. The Japanese volleyball players were amazing!!!!! 

Anyway, this is a restaurant you should not miss if you're in the Westside Market area! 

I'm planning on going back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Family met for brunch today. We had 7 in our group and most of the restaurant was larger groups (lots of Browns gear). The food was good. I had the ABC omelette. Has asked for well done potatoes and was a little disappointed in them. We share an order of peroriges and Brie for the table and both appetizers were delicious. Service was slow. Our waiter asked me when he saw we had our meal if we had gotten our appetizers (he hadn't been back to the table in awhile). We also could have used more refills on our drinks. Overall good company and the food was good. Love the expanded space. It's a little loud. It would be great if something could be put on the walls/ceiling to help with the noise."}
{"text":"Some good friends decided to take me here for lunch one day recently (as I had never been here before)...what took me so long?!?!?

Heck's is well known in Cleveland for the quality burgers, so of course I had to try one. I ended up with the Rogue Burger...a juicy patty topped with bacon and Roquefort cheese dressing.  Can you say \"yummmmmmmm\"...

The location of this spot is quite unassuming...you'd drive right by it if you were not looking closely enough and I hear they are making plans for expansion into the adjoining property.  But the inside feel homey and comfortable, adding to the ambiance.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Another Ohio City Treasure: The food here is great. Even the house salad makes your mouth water (definitely go for the apricot dressing with that.) Try to sit in the lovely back room; the open kitchen makes the front a little noisy. It is a tad pricey, but the food and atmosphere are well worth it. Great for a date or an opener for a night out with the girls."}
{"text":"Yum! Great burgers and beer selection.  Some delicious and interesting sides/appetizers too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  The inside feels like a greenhouse, and the menu is terrific.  Pretty good service, reasonably priced, and a great value."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place except sometimes it's freezing in the dining area.  Other than that this is hands down my favorite restaurant! Best burgers ever best creme brulee ever and best atmosphere!  It's super cute inside and the waiting staff is always very professional and dressed  well. Fine establishment you've got here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick little lunch spot and we stumbled upon Heck's. We got a seat outside and the patio is lovely! Our food was really amazing as well. I got the au cheval burger with a side salad, he got the short rib hash, and we shared salt & pepper fries with vinegar aioli. Everything was delicious! The brunch menu has a wide variety of options, and if you're not in the breakfast mood, there are lunch options as well. The coffee is also fantastic. I really enjoyed my first time here!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Beautiful restaurant and great, fresh food.  I got the California Chicken Burger. It was very moist and very well seasoned. Fries were tasty, crispy, hot and fresh.  Pickle had great flavor and was crisp and fresh.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"great Sunday brunch options and fresh ingredients and great custom blend coffee..Bloody Mary a bit on the spicy hot side but good...also great atmosphere as we sat outside.. very attentive server and will be back.."}
{"text":"Oh man, here goes. I'm going to be that asshole who calls out the place in Cleveland everyone loves for some reason. 

I've had good food here. Once. Then I have had mediocre to borderline nauseating food here.. A lot. 

It's close to my house, and everyone is so sure of the burgers that I keep trying again...but, alas I've come to conclusion that my friends are clueless. Or are drunk."}
{"text":"Went to this cafe for the very first time today with my friend to grab lunch to go. We both ordered different salads with grilled chicken added on the side, plus the pomegranate green tea (iced). The service was quick and accommodating, and we had our order ready in less than 10 minutes. Perfect timing because we had to get to an event in Ohio City on time. 

I ordered the Avocado Caprese with chicken, and it was a refreshing and satiating meal - full of ripe tomatoes, fresh avocado slices, and tender mozzarella bites. The dressing was an excellent marinade for the ingredients - not too overpowering but still dense with flavor. I also like how the added grilled chicken was not over salted and was therefore the oil dressing enhanced its taste. The pomegranate iced green tea came in a fancy Republic of Tea bottle. It was also unsweetened - which was exactly what I was hoping for. Together, the meal was on the pricier side - $5 for the iced tea, $15 for the salad (+ chicken). While I think the iced tea may be overpriced, I do think that the high quality of the ingredients used to make the salad gives some merit to its higher cost. I have yet to dine in and try the more substantial entrees offered for lunch and dinner, but as far as salads go - I give it this cafe a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Our party of 10 (with reservations) waited over 45 minutes for 9 entrees, one of which was wrong.  By the time #10 arrived, 8 of us had finished eating.  The last order was corrected over 10 minutes after that.  Veggie burger was tasty, but not served on a wheat bun.  Afraid to send it back and wait even longer.  Side of aioli never arrived.  Fries bland and unseasoned.  Kitchen very disorganized.  We had a server, a drink order taker, a drink runner, and several food runners.  Food runners didn't seem to understand the menu or who ordered what.  Example, handing off burgers describing them as chicken sandwiches.  At least they took two of our orders off the bill due to the long wait.  However, with all of the other options in Cleveland, we won't be back soon."}
{"text":"Oh Heck's...I decided to give you another chance and I am sorry I did.  The burger was overcooked way beyond my requested medium, the fries were tasteless, and the pulled pork had an overbearing orange zest flavor.  The chocolate milkshake was very weak.  How can you mess that up?  Service on the patio was attentive but the food...no bueno.  I'm done."}
{"text":"Very nice, bright area in the dining room. Service was good, place was clean. However the food was ok. I had the baklava french toast- sounded great in theory but it was essentially french toast with syrup and walnuts on top- very average. Came with few pieces of french toast-- the presentation could have been better. The person I was with had the short rib hash- it was bland and very watery. We enjoyed the atmosphere but the food was average."}
{"text":"My wife is from ohio city and told me they had awesome burgers so when I went to try it my expectations were high but after trying it i was disappointed  greatly the burger was Big but was not seasoned well at all I tried it again at a work even event and got the chicken tacos and was not impressed again I will never return."}
{"text":"Came here with my SO for an impromptu date night. It was an hour and 15 minutes before closing so the place wasn't very busy. We were seated promptly and the waitress took our orders. 

I got a Nutella milkshake and we each got a burger. We both like ours cooked medium and the waitress explained that they do a \"true medium\" meaning that the burgers will be very pink in the middle. We got different toppings to go with our burgers and the wait began. 

The milkshake came out almost right away. It was delicious. I could really taste the Nutella. We waited what I felt was a very reasonable time for our burgers. When they finally arrived, there were a few things wrong with our burgers. It was missing cheese and all the condiments were switched around. We decided not to be pests and just ate what was in front of us. 

The burgers were, indeed, a true medium which was very good. I felt that the burger size was rather small from the 1/2 pound burger that was promised. I know the listed weight refers to the precooked weight, but there's no way there was 8 ounces of beef before they cooked it (see attached pictures)

After all, it wasn't a bad experience. A few hiccups here and there, but overall it was pleasant."}
{"text":"I love Heck's for several very important reasons: 

1) Their fries and burgers are the best in town. Fries are golden, crispy and delicious. Burgers range from classic to fun (their Hipster veggie burger, Teriyaki burger etc) and they all taste amazing.

2) The staff is extremely attentive and kind here. I like that we see the same crew each time we go. I feel like they have exceptional customer service here.

3) Seating! This is one of VERY few places in Ohio City where you don't need a reservation to get a spot. In warm months, this gets even better since they have patio seating.

4) Unexpectedly delicious main courses and sides. Think Heck's was just for burgers? Wrong! Try their delicious pasta (which I believe is still made with Ohio City Pasta Co.) or their AH-MAHZ-ING French onion sup paired with their house salad.

You can't go wrong here -- it's a tried and true staple of Ohio City and has never failed to leave me satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Awesome ambience, love the decor. Great brunch spot, I couldn't pick what I wanted from the menu everything looks so good! The regular black coffee is incredible and has a touch of cinnamon which is amazing. I got the crabs Benedict and it was delicious! My husband got the stuffed French toast, he liked it but wasn't overly impressed and the portion size was small. Can't wait to come back and try lunch!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place. Known for its burgers but we had calamari and mussels and they were both great. Kids had the chicken tenders from the appetizer menu and they were the best I have ever tasted. Service was great aa well. Very cozy atmosphere in and out."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Service was good. I got the Avon Burger. Overall decent burger, the meat was cooked perfectly but lacked flavor, and bun was not toasted which made the bun soggy because of the balsamic candies onion and blue cheese. Would have been a different burger if the bun was toasted."}
{"text":"I was visiting with some friends while in Cleveland and we met at Heck's.  I don't know how I've missed this place in the past.  The food was hot and delicious - don't remember a burger quite this good.  The drinks were superb.  The service was grand.  I will be back every time I come to town."}
{"text":"Stopped here after work after reading several good reviews. Had a taste for a good burger and this was the top choice. The burger selection is very vast and unique burgers on the list.. Got the Rogue burger and was more than satisfied with it. Come with bacon and a rouge sause mixture of Bleu cheese and sour cream. Im not evena  bleu cheese fan and this burger hit the spot. Waiter was super nice also which is always a great plus. Heck's will very much get future visits from me. They have fish and chicken options as well if you trying to avoid beef. Small and quaint as well...perfect getaway from the large chains that dominate Cleveland. Highly recommend Heck's if you live near or visiting the near west side"}
{"text":"The Ohio City location is my favorite! It's a lot bigger than it looks and the inside is GORGEOUS. There's a beautiful spiral staircase that has hanging glass succulent plants around it in the center of the dining area. Oh and there's a patio now that's getting warmer! 

I always make a reservation just in case through Open Table, but I have never had to wait more than a couple minutes! We typically arrive around 7-8 p.m. for dinner. The stay has always been super friendly and the food... the food. Wow, it's so good.

Last night, my boyfriend and I ordered the buffalo cauliflower for the starter. It comes with a blue cheese dipping sauce, but the staff was happy to throw in some ranch for us too! The last two times I've gotten the California Chicken Burger - and it has not disappointed. It's topped with pepper jack cheese, guacamole and veggies, all on a pretzel bun. Half of it and I'm full - making it perfect for leftovers. And the fries just melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Decided it was burger day and I wanted to research the best burgers in CLE.  This place comes in the top 15 so I was on my way. Surprisingly I had never been here in all my dining experiences, so it was all new to me.

Its a cool place and very unique.  The older section is cooler than the addition, but I get they needed the space so it is what it is.  I came for the burger.  

Good beer selection and when I asked for a light lager, the server brought a couple of samples which is always a welcomed strategy.  Also ordered some Apps as we were starved and they are worth filling up on as they are as good as they sound on the menu.  Plus, we were able to order 3 and share as they are big enough for the group especially when you read whats next.

The burgers are great, plain and simple.  A large patty, greasy (in a good way), thick bacon and plenty of it, it just all worked.  I had the Rocky River and next time would skip the sour cream, but I will order that again.  The fries are also excellent and worth again filling up on."}
{"text":"I just want to update my review to say that the \"owner\" messaged me with a generic copy/pasted message asking me to remove my negative review because it looks bad for the restaurant. I have no desire to do business with a place like this.

I stand by my comments, I feel like the food is overpriced for the quality of it and there are better options in the neighborhood. This is based on several visits over a couple of years. Service has been hit and miss, unless it is atrocious, I don't fault a restaurant since servers come and go."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Cant find one fault.  We sat outside, food was fresh, service was awesome.  Its worth walking down a few blocks."}
{"text":"I've been there twice. The first time didn't leave an impression on me one way or another, but I thought it was a little overpriced. I was certainly willing to give it another try, especially since Heck's has such a great outdoor patio. It was a mistake.

I ordered a $15 salad expecting it to be, at the very least, fresh. Many of the salad leaves were turning brown and were clearly not fresh. That's completely unacceptable. No matter what, when I order a salad from any restaurant the leaves should not be even the slightest bit brown from aging, not even from a fast food joint. To pay $15 for a salad at a supposedly good restaurant and get old greens in it is a total ripoff. It wasn't because of the type of greens used in the salad. The greens didn't taste fresh, they were limp, old, and discolored. It's so simple to prepare a good salad. Use the freshest ingredients. Make sure your customers never have to cut anything. Make a good, homemade dressing with good ingredients. Come on, Heck's."}
{"text":"We were touring the Ohio City area on a Saturday afternoon and decided to dine at Heck's. We stopped in around 4:30 pm and asked for a reservation (party of 3) at 5:30 pm as we wanted to visit the Glass Bubble Project (which closes at 6) before having dinner. We were told that there were no tables available at or after 5:30 pm. We then asked for 5:15 pm and were able to secure a reservation. We hurried over to see the Glass Bubble Project and then rushed back to Heck's to get there by 5:15 pm. The restaurant was more than half empty when we were seated, and remained more than half empty the entire time we were there (til 6:15 pm). We are not sure what kind of game they are playing when they tell people there are no reservations or tables available. It was rather irritating and deceitful to say the least. Two of us ordered burgers (teriyaki burger and regular burger) and one of us ordered the braised beef short rib entree. Our food was pretty good ... the short ribs may have been a little on the salty side. We also ordered cocktails ... the gin and jam and a cocktail with vodka and cranberry (both were okay, but not great)."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4. A lot of hate seems to be going around on Yelp about Heck's, but they have a pretty awesome patio on a relatively quiet tree-lined street.  On top of that, glancing inside it seemed rather quaint.  Patio tables are relatively spaced out, which is ideal for a big group of people or when your breath smells terrible at brunch from your 2AM boondoggle on West 25th the night before.

Cost: 3. This is for brunch- the cost for most items was fair, but thought appetizers and omelettes were maybe slightly high versus some comparables restaurants in the area ($1-2 premium).

Food Quality: 3. So the burgers are solid and their Belgian waffle (caramelized bananas-walnuts) was a smash hit.  I had the Tournedos Benedicts (their signature item) which was missing something, I'm just not sure what.  Don't go out of your way to order it.  Appetizers were o.k. but a lot of them are coming from a large generic supplier (I've had the exact mozzarella sticks and chicken tenders they 
offer at other places before), so don't think you're getting anything novel or unique in this category.  Drinks- cinnamon coffee offered is excellent.

Service: 4. Our service was very impressive, coffee and water refills came nonstop and service overall was very prompt.  Particularly encouraging given the patio was pretty full.

When to return: Weekend brunch.  Summer patio spot that's not quite as jammed packed.  Big group.  Burger craving.  Summertime."}
{"text":"I have found the most amazing, over-the-top dessert in Cleveland and it is at Heck's.
But I get ahead of myself, let's start at the beginning. Heck's hasn't really been on our radar since I thought it was just a burger joint -- albeit a really good one -- but a co-worker of mine recently went there and talked up its knife-and-fork food so on Saturday we decided to give it a try.
The  restaurant is one of those buildings that you can only find in Ohio City or Tremont -- a residential home that has been transformed into an eatery and this one seemed to have been added onto once or twice to account for growing popularity. 
We had the calamari ($11.50) for the appetizer -- and they came very tender and lightly coated with a subtle aioli for dipping. Very respectable, but of course it was nothing like the Sweet Burger we had for dessert... but I digress again.
My main course was the short rib with sweet potato hash and wilted greens ($24). The meat was tender and well-seasoned and the hash had just the right amount of onions and bacon (Ok, you can always have more bacon) to go with the diced sweet potato which was neither too hard or too mushy.
Jeannene had the strip steak ($28) and while the potato au gratin was a stunning eye opener as they used blue cheese, the steak was surprisingly boring. It was cooked correctly but there was no rub or marinade to it or a good char, that we could detect.  
But all that was nothing compared to the almighty Sweet Burger ($7). I appreciate a chef-ed up dessert where it's a small portion with three or four flavors perfectly orchestrated and a blend of pillowy softness and satisfying crunch. But this was old-school \"You want dessert? Here's your dessert!\"
The \"burger\" was two thick chocolate-chip cookies serving as the bun, a thick brownie being the meat and scoops of vanilla ice cream as the cheese. And it was the size of an actual hamburger they serve as a main course there. And then there were the \"fries\" -- funnel cakes in the form of thick french fries and a tart raspberry dipping sauce that represented the ketchup.
We especially loved the crispy outside, airy inside of the \"fries\" though cookie/ice cream/brownie is never bad.
I asked the waitress if anyone ever orders this just for themselves, not to split, and she said yes, that people will take an extra hour just to finish it all. I might accept that challenge next time."}
{"text":"After we faced locked doors at the Happy Dog, I got out my trusty Yelp app and looked for an alternative. Heck's came up and I was excited because it was another restaurant on my \"to try\" list. When we arrived there were about 3 tables ahead of us which is not a big deal, but the waiting area is tiny. I didn't mind that about 7 of us were snug like sardines in the little entry way, but I did mind when a old lady hit us with her cane to get us to move out of the way. Easy, grandma. About 20 minutes later we were sat at a quaint little table for two in the \"atrium\" area. The sun was shining in from the windows and for a moment I felt my winter blahs melt away. Our server was very prompt and efficient, but could have been a little more personable. But I guess I'll take a never-empty Diet Coke over personality. I ordered the Teriyaki burger and my fiance had the Rogue burger. We both ordered our burgers medium well and they came out over well, which was a little bit of a disappointment. I loved the pineapple and onion combo on my burger, and the juicy teriyaki sauce helped the overcooked burger not be too dry. I was surprised the burger did not come with any cheese and must have overlooked that fact on the menu. It would have given the burger that little extra oomph it needed. My fiance was happy with his choice of burger toppings, but agreed the meat was dry and lacked in flavor. The onion rings and fries were just ok and only slightly warm when we received them. I had a little bit of sticker shock when I got the bill.  Dang...almost $40 for 2 hamburgers and sodas? Overall I think Heck's is pretty pricey for just an A-OK experience."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for my boyfriend and myself this past Saturday night. We ordered the cauliflower asiago dip to share, and he got the Burger Au Cheval and I had the Hipster veggie burger. The dip was very good and I liked that it was accompanied with fresh veggies for dipping (it came with bread also). Our burgers were also outstanding. My bf raved about his, and my veggie burger was one of the best I've had in awhile. It was definitely a substantial and homemade veggie burger. The fries that were served with both our burgers were fresh cut and crispy, just the way I like them. We will definitively order from Heck's again, and look forward to actually eating in the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"We came in for Sunday Brunch. I ordered a market burger, and my friends ordered moo shu hash and tournedos breakfast, with a baked brie to start. Our food came out quickly. All were warm and delicious except for the market burger:  I asked for it cooked medium, but it came well done. Both the braised beef and patty were bland and tasteless, and the fries were not salted. This was the first time I'd ever returned food.

Our server Kevin was patient, attentive, and very understanding. He allowed me to order a tournedos breakfast instead, which came out fast and as perfect as the other one.

In short, despite the terrible burger, I'm convinced the service and food here are excellent."}
{"text":"I love Ohio City and this is almost one of my favorite spots to sit outside and dine.The service is always good and food tasty.Plus its kind of off the beaten path and doesn't give you the busy Ohio City feel."}
{"text":"Really went down hill, were excited to come back and delighted to see the addition.  We selected roasted eggplant stuffed with zatar seasoned vegetables and rice @ $16.50.  Undercooked eggplant, mostly rice with two carrots, absolutely overpriced tasteless meal.  Other meal was an arugula salad with cooked goat cheese, the arugula was piled high with a few tomatoes slices that were not ripe.  The cheese was rubbery, this was over $10. Perhaps the owner should look to employ a real chef."}
{"text":"Very good burgers. We had a party of four and all had different burgers. We loved them all. Definitely going back soon. Mimosas and craft beer were also great."}
{"text":"It never disappoints. The servings are large enough to share. Also if you share there's a better chance you'll save room for dessert, then you have to get the espresso creme brulee or their churro sundae, it's amazing.I've been here 2 or 3 times now and ive never been upset with my choices. The avon burger is my favorite thing on the menu with a close second being the miso glazed salmon. Its a quaint little cafe right on the corner of bridge and 29th and im so excited i found this place its a nice walk for me from work. Also check out their daily specials!!"}
{"text":"Ew. I wish I could give this place zero stars. I ordered the baked Brie and sweet burger delivered by Uber eats- both sounded great but were huge disappointments.  The Brie was wrapped in dough which was not cooked at all. This restaurant did the impossible- they ruined cheese."}
{"text":"What the heck...

THE UP-SIDE:
A nice little restaurant that's been a part of the Ohio City scene for a long time.  Big selection of good burgers and a host of other, fancier selections.  Quiet, pleasing atmosphere.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
The food is good, and the place is nice - definitely - but somehow it always feels like it doesn't quite live up to what it could be.  It's like it's almost there.  Almost, but not quite...

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Go here if you're not going to be way picky about the food and you just wanna have some good conversation with a friend."}
{"text":"I really like everything about this place except the food is just so-so. The coffee was great, tasted like there was cinnamon in it. The service was good and the place itself is back off the main road. But the food wasn't really worth the prices to me. I would try it again though."}
{"text":"In our everlasting quest for fantastic burgers, my friends and I landed at Heck's after an afternoon of shopping at the West Side Market. I looked longingly at the cute patio seating as we walked in, but the need for air conditioning on this 90 degree day was undeniable. But then the hostess led us into the most magical seating area I have yet experienced in a restaurant, the high ceiling was translucent enough to allow a copious amount of natural lighting to filter in, giving the whole room the softest, most relaxing atmosphere. In the center of the room was a wrought iron spiral staircase with live plants cascading off of the sides. I felt like we were sitting in the secret garden room of a country estate, you'd never guess that we were smack-dab in the middle of an Ohio City neighborhood. There were different seating areas as well, a darker and cozier bar area with more tables on the other side, some classic wooden booths, and a private room that I would assume is for private events.

Our server was most kind and courteous, our water glasses never stood empty, and we were never left wanting for anything. We all orders burgers of course; our selections included the Avon Burger, the Greek burger, and a custom burger with caramelized balsamic onions and grilled mushrooms, all coming with a side of fries. Our food arrived quite promptly, and each burger was cooked just as ordered. The topping combinations were flavorful masterpieces, each unique from the other, and each amazing in a different way. We all agreed that we would have been happy with any of the burgers for ourselves! The fries were also excellent, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

We all agreed that next time we are in Ohio city, we would be eagerly returning to Heck's for more burgers, and possibly to sample some of their dinner entrees. Well done, Heck's!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. I have been here three times now and each time I leave disappointed. I do have to say the coffee is really nice with spice.  My eggs for eggs Benedict were severely over cooked (almost hardboiled) last time. Today I got chicken and waffles. The chive waffle was good. The chicken itself was fine too but the fried part was more like it was just dunked in oil. My husband liked his dish of short rib hash, but it was boring. Nothing is bad here, but I just think it's too expensive to be so blah."}
{"text":"I went to Heck's for Mother's Day with my boyfriend, his 2 brothers and their Mom.  It looked like a quirky little place, which is fine with me.

We were seated immediately, and our waiter was very attentive throughout our visit.  

I ordered the Heck's House Salad.  The menu stated \"mixed fresh greens\" and an assortment of delicious-sounding things.  Imagine my disappointment when my salad arrived and I saw my \"mixed fresh greens\" was really iceberg lettuce. ICEBERG LETTUCE in a $10.50 salad.  I'm allergic to iceberg lettuce.  Yes, it's my fault for not confirming the greens which were included in the salad, but what restaurants serve iceberg lettuce salads anymore?  Well, other than cheap places.  I certainly didn't expect it here.  Add to that, the other items in the salad (bleu cheese, dried tart cherries, tomatoes, red onions and walnuts) were all hard to find, with the exception of the cherries.  The apricot vinaigrette was very, very good (best part of my salad, without a doubt.)  Honestly, I make better-looking and tastier salads at home.

In light of my salad catastrophe, I had some of my boyfriend's omelet.  It was absolutely delicious.  His brothers had burgers which they said were good, but not as good as the burgers used to be.  His Mom also had a salad, and her salad was full of iceberg lettuce as well.

I can't put my finger on it, but I just didn't like this place.  The decor was really neat and funky, seating options are neat and our waiter was great.  Even so, I don't see myself returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The vibe here is a little confusing. It seems a little upper-crusty, yet not since their menu is a bit more casual. It's still a pretty restaurant and we've only heard good things about it.

Ben F. ordered the Burger au Poivre - and he couldn't have ordered anything better. He raved about the flavor and although he's not a sour cream fan, he's been converted! I had the Rocky River burger and didn't enjoy it as much. I usually don't mind Swiss cheese, but it killed it for me. Sad.

Glad we tried it out, but I don't think I'd return if I'm ever back in Ohio."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here over the weekend for brunch. The service was incredibly slow and when our food arrived it was slightly undercooked. However, the waitstaff (which was very friendly) apologized profusely for these issues and comped us half our meal (which ended up being delicious, every last bite of it). Any time a restaurant actually owns up to their mistakes is big as these days the idea that the customer comes first isn't always practiced in the service industry. Despite the issues we had here the food and customer service won us over so we will definitely be back. It's a great place to hang outside for a relaxing meal and good for groups too."}
{"text":"amazing food and even better service from Jen.  Thanks for making our night memorable"}
{"text":"I screamed in horror when I saw what they called a vegetarian burger.  Quite honestly the worst interpretation I have ever seen.  Yes, it was really that bad.  It mimicked road kill with shredded beets (blood) and black beans just thrown there with no define shape.  Soggy fries and mediocre service told me that it was time to pack up and quickly flee.  I saw a lot of 5 star reviews for this place which either tells me that most Ohioans are under the influence of narcotics or there sure are a lot of paid reviewers out there.  In a lot of places heck is used for hell...you can figure it out...."}
{"text":"We are long time Heck's lovers over 30 years ago and came away with the feeling \"what happened?.\" Burger's were sadly unadorned and had an \"off\" flavor on a Millbrook bun for $12! French fries were double or triple cooked and the coffee that used to be such a treat was gone. Very sad and cannot recommend them anymore. Time for a new place.....feel bad for the wait staff that were very nice."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday morning with two friends and their children. I was greeted warmly at the door; my friends had come early, and the host actually remembered that there was a party waiting for two more and was able to direct me to them.

I started with a grapefruit mimosa, which was delicious and appropriately priced. The server was patient; I took about ten minute to decide on a drink. For my entree, I had the tuna steak burger, which came with a side of french fries. The burger was cooked to order and was absolutely delicious. The tuna and the other pieces of the burger on the bun were all fantastic. The fries were crispy and well-seasoned, and they made a great accompanying dish.

I loved my food here, but the star was actually the fantastic staff. I mentioned the host before; our server was attentive and patient, and the bussers were constantly refilling my water before it was even finished. The staff was also quite friendly towards my friends' two children. 

Overall, this restaurant was wonderful, and I will definitely come back again. I hope they continue to do exactly what they're doing."}
{"text":"I've been eyeballing Heck's sweet burger dessert on social media for weeks -- to the point where I was sending daily pictures of it to my friends asking them to take me.  My friends were getting so annoyed with hearing about this dessert.  So when my brother was in town from Michigan for one night -- it seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally try it (and relieve my friends from hearing about it).  I talked it up to him the entire ride to Heck's.

Yelp says Heck's closes at 9 pm -- so I called the restaurant and the woman ensured me they close at 11.  I let her know that the Yelp time was wrong, and she was quite rude / confused, asking what I would like her to do about it.  Well, nothing...

We got there around 9:20 pm and sat outside.  The server was very pleasant and accommodating.  As we were ordering dinner, he said if we wanted dessert we would have to order soon because the kitchen was closing.  This confused me as the woman I spoke with just told me they closed at 11.  But I thought, no big deal, and we placed our dessert order with dinner.

I ordered the turkey burger and my brother ordered another specialty burger.  We both agreed that the burgers were great and very obviously fresh off the grill.  However, as polite as the server was, he never checked back once during dinner.  I tried to find some ketchup outside, but was unsuccessful.  We also ran out of beverages.  Not a huge deal on either.

After dinner, the sweet burger dessert finally came.  I was so excited.  Except... the cookies were rock hard.  The brownie was too!  Both tasted store bought.  The ice cream ratio was minuscule.  The funnel cake fries were cold (not luke warm -- cold).  The raspberry sauce was good, but very runny and did not stick to the fries.  Maybe it was the time that we ordered dessert that caused this to be a complete miss?

The one saving grace is that we requested hot fudge on the side and this was impossible to mess up.  They gave us an enormous side of hot fudge that made the cookies / brownie / fries seem more edible.  

Still, wildly disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming to heck's for 15 years, and not just once a year, monthly. Yes, the decor was a little outdated, but the service, and food was always amazing. 

My Mom and I went in this evening. I've been so happy they've been able to expand, and that they updated the place. I haven't been in a few months, so I was excited to see the changes. 

The service was good. But the menu, everything changed! I expected some updating, but even the updated food was disappointing. 

The classic \"heck's house salad\" that I used to know and love, wasn't fresh, and the greens were mediocre, and didn't have their signature house made dressings that made that salad fantastic. 
They left some of the old burgers, but the prices were so high, that we almost wanted to leave. It's like they took everything we loved off of the old menu off. 

Unfortunately my mom and I have to find  our new \"old faithful\". We live in the area, and I really hope they find their groove again."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good, easy meal after trekking through the West Side Market for several hours. We chose Heck's as it was in easy walking distance and had what looked like a varied selection of burgers.
We arrived late in the afternoon on a Saturday. The lunch crowd was gone and the evening crowd had not started to arrive.
We were seated promptly in a nice table in the main dining area.
We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was light and tasty. The portion was adequate for 3 to share but not quite as large as I expected it to be.
My wife had the City burger, I had the Rocky River and my daughter had the California. All were a good size and very well prepared. We all thought they were excellent burgers.
The service was quick and attentive.
The only thing I think could have been better would be to have a listing of the beers on tap with some description. The waiter read off the beers on tap but he 
couldn't really describe any of them.
If you are looking for a very good burger close to the West Side Market, Heck's would be an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Coffee Coffee Coffee

Heck's is a great spot for a Sunday brunch with friends or lunch or dinner.... I was searching for brunches in the area about a year ago and stumbled on to Heck's website. And am so glad I decided to try it! 

First the coffee. Amazing. No additions necessary...unless you are addicted to your cream and sugar. For brunch I highly recommend the ABC Omelet. Huge and a great combination of apple, bacon and cheddar. For lunch the Ohio City Burger and the Cajun Burger are excellent and a favorite of mine is the Spring Chicken Sandwich-soooo yummy!!!! If you get fries you can't go wrong with either style tho the Cajun are pretty spicy so if that's what you like you will love! 

The atmosphere is cute and intimate on the inside and they have a great outdoor patio during the summer/fall. Ask for Jen. She is adorable with a great personality that will charm the pants off you! And don't forget. COFFEE!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at Heck's, didn't know what to expect based on the reviews.  A co-worker and I visited Heck's for lunch.  We were immediately welcomed and seated.  I know that Heck's is known for the burgers, but really wasn't in the mood for a burger so I ordered the Portabello Mushroom Gyro which came with an order of fries.  My co-worker did order a burger.  Our food arrived hot, fresh and quickly.   My meal was on point.  Generous portion of sliced, marinated, well-seasoned and grilled mushrooms on top of spring mix lettuces, drizzled with yogurt sauce and served in warm, fresh flatbread (yum!).  The fries were hand cut and lightly sprinkled with coarse salt and served with a pickle and side of ketchup.  My meal was tasty and well-prepared.  My co-worker was equally pleased.   I thought that the price point was good based on the offerings.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the neighborhood. The menu was changed and my favorite isn't on there anymore, but if they have the ingredients they will make it work. The caramel sea salt milkshake is the best shake I have had in years. A small hidden gem."}
{"text":"Went to Heck's for Sunday brunch.  The service was very slow, twice I had to track down other servers because my server was no where to be found.  The meal took 40 minutes to arrive at the table.  
The coffee was very good, cinnamon added.  Better if you can get a refill.  I had the Eggs Benedict, which was very good.  Overall, I would go elsewhere for comparable food and much better service."}
{"text":"Three stars is generous. They're DAMN lucky they can blend up a shake.

Went here with the vivacious Magic Lee Malicious on a Saturday afternoon. She suggested it, I agreed instantly as I'd heard about the excellent burgers. 

I'm starting to see a trend in Cleveland...perhaps it's restaurants all over, but in Cleveland joints is where I've figured this out. People are under the impression that offering a lot of different toppings and ways to eat it make it a \"good\" burger or a \"good\" hot dog. 

When nothing could be further from the truth. If it's a great burger or hot dog, then it will need little to be delicious.

So that said, you can have your burger about 20 different ways here...I got one with grilled mushrooms and melted cheese...I forget which kind...I think it was swiss...

But, the actual patty was sub-standard. It looked like it came from a box purchased down the block from the freezer of Dave's Market.

Magic's salad seemed to be the same way...not that great.

However, they DO have shakes, and they were awesome. That's where the third star comes in.

The atmosphere kills it (kills it = good), it's really a cool looking place, with some nook and cranny booths, along with the main dining room, situated in a sort of covered porch in the back. And, in the summer they have a great outdoor patio. I'll be going there for a late shake in 80 degree weather, for sure.

For the burgers? Nah. I can go across the street to Wendy's for a tastier one."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Hecks, I get the same thing... 

...because it's so freakin' good.

And what, pray tell, am I referring to? 

The fish n' chips...yah    

I'm kind of a fish n' chips snob. I get it everywhere I go. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's really bad. Hecks does it GREAT. The big chunks of fish are superbly battered and perfectly fried. The \"chips\" are large potato wedges that are super crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  A couple other noteworthy items are the crab cakes, brie and burgers. 

I love the interior of the place. It's like eating inside of a greenhouse. Lots of flowers and plants. The outside makes for a nice place to sit as well. Hecks is in a great location.

Overall, a great place for a casual meal."}
{"text":"We loved this dinner! Been here a couple times and have had good experiences but this meal was to die for. My burger was juicier than ever. Get a burger if you come here. Salads are good too, a little expensive for the size once you add chicken though. Got the fruit as a side, which was a nice change, fresh raspberries and oranges. 

Only complaint: the back room is LOUD. Idk why it's so loud, but man it's loud. Sit in the greenhouse type room if possible."}
{"text":"I've been going to Heck's for a dozen years and have always had great food and fantastic service. Just stopped in today for a small, family brunch and wow! Everything was perfect. My wife had the Heck's breakfast, which was delicious, my son had some bacon Mac n cheese, and I had what I believe to be the best burger in town- the Burger Au Cheval. Perfect sized pattie and it was the perfect ratio to toppings  and bun. The egg breaks open and covers all the meats, and blends absolutely perfectly with the cheddar cheese and sour cream as it seeps into the bun. A rich, and decadent burger experience. Our server, Rob was as good as it gets. Attentive, efficient, and friendly. Definitely a must have if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Where do I BEGIN??? Well, let's just say by far the WORST service EVER!! I went in there to get a coffee to go, (the USED to have the BEST COFFEE ANYWHERE), WELL, let me tell you), I ordered my coffee, the HOSTESS, never bothered to ask me how many creams or sugars I wanted with my coffee \"she just walked away\", SO, I am thinking it's fine, she will bring me cream and sugar, LMAO, I didn't say anything, SO she came back with my coffee and gave me 2 creams on the side WITH NO SUGAR, I paid the outrageous price of 3.00, gave her the 3.00 in cash, she walked away, more like \"RAN AWAY\", before I can ask her for sugar, here I was standing there with my mouth OPENED by how stupid she was, how the hecks can you give someone cream without sugar for their coffee to go?? BAD SERVICE, AND I WANT MY 3.00 BACK, I would never pay 18.50 for a darn salad when, I can go and make my own for 5.00 good bye hecks and good riddence!!!!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal: Hecks is a great place, but it is what it is. It is not a fancy restaurant. I consider it a casual mid-range neighborhood joint, say, a step up from Academy Tavern in Larchmere neighborhood. Personally, I never order anything but burgers here, BUT I AM OF THE OPINION THAT THEY HAVE SOME OF THE BEST BURGERS IN CLEVELAND (perhaps *the* best?). We go here all the time with another couple and all of our kids (4 adults, 4 kids in all). We always receive consistently good food and service, and they are always endlessly accommodating of our kids. I give this place 5 stars because I love this place, I keep spending money there, again and again, and it does what it does well. A Ferrari is a Ferrari.  A Honda Accord is a Honda Accord."}
{"text":"OVER RATED!

Don't believe the hype. 

Ok ok I shouldn't be so harsh. This place is ok. BUT it could be so so so much more. It has a great location in the heart of Ohio City, a gorgeous main dining room, and a great concept. The execution is just lacking. It is truly sad.  This place could be SO MUCH MORE if they changed a few things starting with a lot of the menu (drinks and food). In general the staff is great nice and knowledgable.  The drinks are not worth what they charge.  The food is fairly good most of the time but in groups they tend to get cooking directions for the burgers mixed up so you can end up with a well done burger when you wanted medium rare. 

What I recommend
The Spring Chicken Sandwich
Any burger that does not include sour cream or pineapple (need an idea? I recommend the Ohio City Burger with Havarti)
French fries (honestly though who doesn't like fried potatoes)
The coffee

Hit or Miss
Groups ordering burgers
The drinks

Things to avoid like the plague
Salads (sogginess)
Grilled cheese sandwich (american and bleu and spinach yelch)
Ohio City Martini (GROSS)"}
{"text":"I do some theatre at Near West, so I have been trying a lot of the local business for food around rehearsals and shows and things. 
I had a show on Mother's Day, and my mom HATES all those Mother's Day brunch things that all the big chainy restaurants do. Shes a kindergarten teacher and on mother's day all she wants is to be rid of small children (espcially since all her's are all grown up)

We decided on Heck's for brunch and it was a great choice!
My parents are not super adventurous and love a good burger, so this was a great choice. Everyone was happy, the burgers were great, and the back room is great!

All in all, the prices were decent, a good family place, something for everyone on the menu. I would definatly go back here."}
{"text":"First time I came here was Sunday Evening. My pregnancy craving was French Onion Soup and my husband had always wanted to try Heck's Cafe. Wow! The soup was awesome and he loved his Avon burger! I can't wait to come back and try some of the cocktails! He had a bourbon cocktail that he raved over. Our friendly bartender was Jen and she was very patient with us and very friendly. We also had a wonderful conversation with Amber. 

I loved it so much that I went back last night for the soup. I got mashed potatoes as well. Once again, the service was amazing! My bartender was Rachel and she rocked! I love having servers that actually like to interact with their customers. Great Job Jen, Amber, and Rachel! You will see is back soon! Props to the kitchen staff as well, as we were leaving on Sunday they took the time to ask us what we had and how we liked it! This is probably my new favorite OHC restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Had a new years eve lunch here today. Everything was delicious, the husband and I both had burgers and fries . Everything was prepared great, burgers were so tasty and juicy can't wait to go back!   

P.S. watch the step down when leaving the restaurant, I wasn't and took an unfortunate fall...really messed up my knee and ankle."}
{"text":"I've been to Heck's twice now, once for Sunday brunch and another time for lunch. The brunch menu was pretty diverse so we ordered the short rib hash and the chicken and waffles to share. I enjoyed both, but I'm a sucker for braised beef. 

For lunch, we all ordered burgers and they make a darn good burger. 

I also really love sitting in the atrium. It's so relaxing and the natural light is perfect. The restaurant has a \"regular\" dining room as well that could accommodate larger parties.  

Service was exceptional both times."}
{"text":"Sorry, Heck's, but this is some tough love from a neighbor. I desperately want you to be successful because of your prime real estate and excellent building. 

You need to pay attention to what people think about your food. You seem to be stuck in 2005 or whenever it was that you last won \"Best Burger.\" Those days are gone. Ohio City has changed, Cleveland has changed, and peoples' tastes have changed. You were once a rarity when there wasn't a burger joint on every corner, all of them serving high quality, local, grassfed beef that's cooked and seasoned properly, usually for about 10 bucks. Your restaurant is dying to be on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. How Heck's survived the Recession Restaurant Die-Off of '08-09 is beyond me.

Your prices are outrageous, especially for frozen appetizers. Come on. ABC's burger up the street is $6.75 and tastes bite for bite ten times better than anything on your menu. 

You need a chef. Who is your chef? Do you even have one? There isn't one listed anywhere and there seems to be no real passion or quality control in your kitchen. I'm looking at your menu right now and I swear it's virtually unchanged from the first time I came to Heck's in 2008. And speaking of the menu, your website reflects your restaurant. That's not a compliment. The only way to access your menu is a Word file. You do realize that not all people have Word, meaning they could never see your menu at home? Do you know what a PDF is? (EDIT: Thanks to the Wayback Machine website, I was able to pull up the menu from 2007. It's pretty much exactly the same as 2013. That is beyond pathetic.)

http://web.archive.org/web/20070322152151/http://www.heckscafe.com/1070797.html

The neighborhood has changed so drastically in the past few years and you're just sitting there doing nothing. This is just poor restaurant management. Off the top of my head, here's a list of places within a few blocks with better burgers than Heck's: ABC Tavern, Old Angle, Nano Brew, Black Pig, Bar Cento, Westside Market Cafe, BonBon, and maybe even Great Lakes Brewery. 

That last one should sting a little. Shape up or close down. You're taking up such a beautiful corner putting out subpar food. Wake up."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with an very unique interior. I got the veggie burger during their lunch hours on a Wednesday. It wasn't crowded and we were seated quickly which was nice. Our waiter was incredibly attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. 

My one main complaint was my veggie patty. Though I appreciate the freshness and quality of ingredients of the patty, I found it overall to be pretty bland. Even with the avocado aioli it just didn't do much for me. It was interesting that it looked more like roughly chopped vegetables kind of compressed into patty form unlike your typical brown mush/blended patties you can buy at the store. I liked this concept but I think it needed some kind of binding agent to pull it all together.


Overall it was a nice stop for lunch, though I wish I had gotten something different."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! The food was superb as well! I would definitely come back and would recommend!!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is great!  The Burger selection is huge and they are delicious.  I love the fact that you can actually see the ccoks cooking your food if you wanted to.  The kitchen is up front and if you are picky about who's cooking your food then this is the spot.  The italian-American menu is phenomenal and made with fresh ingredients.  Their wine and beer selection is great and the dine-in italian setting is a great spot to take a date."}
{"text":"We are here for dinner on a trip to Cleveland for my boyfriend's birthday.

It's an adorable little place that's bigger than it looks.

Our waitress was so nice and friendly, probably one of the best I've had in a long time! I wish I could remember her name, she had short dark hair and was just so attentive and helpful.

We got some Brie as an appetizer and it was yummy and gooey and the fruit on top was a perfect compliment.

Our food came out super fast, I got the stuffed squash and he got the Ohio City burger.

My squash was filled to the brim with veggies and was really good. My boyfriend really liked his dish as well and I really liked some of his fries 

We got the salted caramel pretzel bread pudding for dessert and LOVED IT. I really wanted to try their dessert burger and funnel fries but maybe next time.

Forgetful me left my purse hanging on the chair as we were walking out the door, and our waitress came running at a full Sprint to make sure she caught us before we got to far, and I really appreciated that.

They were a little expensive but I think it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food - known for their hamburgers and brunch. Wonderful ambiance for brunch or lunch. Love the decor. Sometimes the service could use a bit more friendliness to it, but always great service and food. Prices are fair. The space definitely adds to the meal."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!

The best best burger in Cleveland. Hand Down. Great atmosphere, the staff was really friendly, and the food was amazing. We will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Name says it all...

It's one heck of an experience! If you want to splurge for one night... this place is for you! The food is good and I'll be back again... even if I don't live in Ohio City!"}
{"text":"I ate at Heck's on 8/9 as part of a party of 4.  We arrived early from our 7pm reservations, and were seated without issue or delay.  

I have to say that the highlight of our visit was the waitstaff. Everyone was very courteous, (but not overly so as to suspect sarcasm or that it was ingenious.)  Our waiter was attentive, quick with recommendations, and did so without being intrusive.  We were the only party in the room for most of our meal, but we never felt as though the staff was hovering.  

Appetizers:  Devils on Horseback - Tasty, well balanced, but only 3 pieces.  I really would've appreciated a larger portion size, (as in, at least one per person.)  However, the Pomme Frites were a standout.  I'd consider getting those solely as a meal.  

Entrees: My wife got the bacon wrapped filet.  She claimed it was good, but she's had better.  Another person got the salmon, which she claimed was on the dry side, but was redeemed by some fantastic risotto.  I got the Market City Burger, which was topped with incredible short ribs.  Those short ribs need to be the star of their own entree.  The actual burger patty was lost in the mix of that fantastic, glazed, shredded beef, which is a shame because it seemed to be of high quality.

Drinks:  Wine on tap is an interesting idea.  I'm the only one from our party that deviated, instead opting for a Mint Julip.  The drink was horribly unbalanced - I only received the taste of the bourbon.  The mint wasn't so much muddled as it was fondled or fluffed. The drink came off as a glass of bourbon that just happened to have other stuff in it.  I settled for a bottled beer for drink #2. 

Heck's would be an ideal lunch spot, but if I want a \"fancypants, leave-the-kids-at-home, adults only\" night then I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"2nd time there. Fish and chips and carnitas bowl took 40 min. The bowl was eh. Fish was fabulous. What took so long? Dunno but next time, we will check out the menu ahead of time and order immediately when we get there. Price was reasonable for downtown so will go back. Waitress said her orders were slow all day.  Kitchen needs to knock it out."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Heck's Cafe!!  I have started taking friends/family here whenever we go out because I can always depend on fantastic customer service, delicious drinks, and unique, quality food.  Heck's is by far one of the best restaurants in Cleveland and they should be proud of their loyal following.  Also love the addition onto the back."}
{"text":"Bleh--update yourself, Hecks. 

No longer can you get away with passing off sub-par quality food for premium prices. 

You can tell when they're normally half empty and they used to be packed. Food quality has slipped and it shows.

When restaurants around you are serving delicious, all natural, grass-fed Ohio beef burgers, what makes you think adding a bunch of toppings will help you? 

Disappointed. :(

Also, please for the love of god hire better servers. Please.

Maybe after all these years I've been missing the brunch? Ehhh... I could be totally wrong, but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm giving Heck's 3 stars because the food has not really impressed me.  It's good when it's prepared well, but at times, it can be very disappointing. Ordered the falafel burger once and it was somewhat cold and not cooked thoroughly.  Also have ordered the brie and the puff pastry was burnt on the bottom, which altered the taste completely.  I've gotten breakfast hash and omelet that were fine though. The food isn't anything innovative, but it's a good place to meet for bigger groups. They were very accommodating when we did this last fall.  They also have a pretty room in the middle with some nice lighting and windows.  And to be able to eat in Ohio City without having to wait - yay!    I'm still waiting on that meal that will have me raving. But for now, I'll keep giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Memorial Day because everything else was closed. Come on, Cleveland. Really? It is a charming little place and the neighborhood is cute. I had the teriyaki burger and my friend had the Ohio Burger. Mine was moist and juicy, very tasty and filled me up. My friend complained that her burger was dry. It was worth the trip and helped assuage our disappointment at not getting to look inside The Christmas Story House."}
{"text":"Gosh I don't know where to start with this one. 

It took forever for our waitress to initially come over. We ordered the guac and chips app because it's something we'll all eat. Not a good choice! The menu said it came with pico, it came without. The guac had little to no flavor and came with about 10 chips. 

We waited at least 45 minutes for 4 burgers. Right before the food arrived, the waitress told us they were out of garlic/rosemary for the fries. Seriously? The burgers all arrived missing ingredients but we were so starving by that point that we didn't care. 

We were seated next to the kitchen and another waitress was complaining to the manager about the food being incorrect and the manager told her to stop complaining and deal with it. Easy for him to say- his salary doesn't depend on tips! The expo was reviewing orders and most of them seemed to be wrong. 

My burger was decent despite missing ingredients. The fries were all undercooked. We had a draft beer and tried to order seconds but they were of course out of it. 

The waitress was apologetic and comped our app but I don't know. This place is a disaster- I wouldn't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"I have to downgrade the rating on this one. Unfortunately the chicken burger I had was chock full of tendons and pretty grotesque to eat. I looked like a crazy person pulling chicken pieces out of my mouth.

 It also must not have been tenderized because it was about as thick as steak. I went to take a bite and it was so thick it slipped out of the bun. Don't mean to be a complainer over here but it was not a pleasant chicken burger, pretty dry too. 

The milk shake was pretty small and not thick with ice cream, couldnt taste the caramel or the salt. Pretty disappointed on this one have to be honest."}
{"text":"Went to heck's for lunch on a Saturday.  This place is a must try in Ohio City!! To start they have a ton of vegetarian options and they're good too!  We got the onion rings to start which were okay.  But when my meal showed up OMG the wild mushroom ravioli was so good!! I wish I had more bread to dip in the goat cheese sauce.  We also got the stuff squash which was as pretty as it was good!! Everything in squash was supper fresh and the jam was so good too.  

Our waiter was really nice and helpful too.  He answered all of our questions and our food came out quickly.  Also if you are at heck's you need to a cup of their house coffee.  They sell it by the bag too.  Overall heck's is amazing and hidden gem in ohio city.  We will be back for sure and next time we will get a bag of coffee take home too!!"}
{"text":"First time at Hecks last night. Our reservations were at 6:30 and we arrived a few minutes early but no problem. Seated right away. They also have complimentary valet parking which I strongly suggest using as parking can be a challenge.

Service was prompt and attentive. We all ordered different burgers and all of us were wowed by them. We agreed one of he best burgers in the city. For dessert, salted caramel pretzel bread pudding. Delicious.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday with my wife, 2 year old, and a couple friends. Sat in the greenhouse room (patio was full),  cool ornate staircase. good for kid (macaroni &cheese - very plain, but great French fries & milk) . Beer selection limited, was hoping for a couple better options on tap. Nice staff. Great burger! My friends got breakfast food (looked somewhat average, They seemed content). Limited parking options. Would recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch for the first time today and really liked it. It's casual and quirky. The menu is simple but well prepared and fresh. Our server was AWESOME! He didn't rush us, he paced things nicely and always checked on us. Love!!

The decor in the main restaurant is quirky and cozy.   It's in a historic house, not pretentious.

They have gluten free hamburger buns :)

Good solid choice for brunch!"}
{"text":"Overall, very good. This is my first time here in years. Much more than burgers/fries they're known for as they have an expanded menu. Hands down the best burger and great price around. I also tried the PEI mussels with pom frittes appetizer. Was disappointed in the size of the mussels, but the flavor and fresh fry on top give this a 4 star rating. Service is excellent. Atmosphere awesome. You can substitute onion rings ISO fries with the burgers for $1 extra and that is totally worth it! They serve the Orings with spicy aioli very good. Ask for a side of garlic aioli for the fries. We're going back for more. Definitely check out!"}
{"text":"First let me say that I haven't been to Heck's in over 25 years. I loved Heck's back in the day.  This time, just so-so. We had a larger party with a reservation.  We were seated promptly and they willingly added an extra chair when we had one more show up.  Wait staff was friendly and attentive for the most part.   We had to wait a little longer than I would have expected to place orders but it wasn't a big deal since our party was large and having drinks.   

Onto the burgers... for $10+ a burger one would expect to get an amazing burger and or an amazing presentation.  My Avon burger was OK, but not the best burger that I've ever had and the fries in the little stainless steel cup.... kinda cold.  Menu says\" The Avon Burger
Balsamic candied onions, blue cheese, truffled potato sticks, baby
arugula $12\"   I was hoping for big, overflowing with caramelized onions and bleu cheese, a mouth watering piece of grass fed beef, nodda.. nope, just another overpriced hamburger.  The truffle potato sticks looked like something out of can. Nothing else to say-- it was pretty nondescript.     

My dining companion had the Burger Au Poivre -
Worcestershire sauce, peppercorn, grilled onions, sour cream $11. It too was a bit of a disappointment.   

On the upside, the desserts were large and amazing.     The Flour-less Chocolate Torte with Crème Anglaise, caramel sauce, spicy bacon brittle was thick and dense and chock full of chocolate deliciousness. At $8 a bit on the steep side for dessert but plant to split between two people.     The other folks at the table got the Apple Cobbler and the Brownie Sundae which also were hefty portions enough for two. 

What a bummer.  Hecks had been so good for a burger.  Maybe just a dessert place now..   :-("}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Herb's in awhile but went for lunch and had a pleasant experience. The courtyard has great ambience and our sandwiches were delicious. There was a soup special advertised  tomato something-or-other but it was different than expected-more a chicken broth-like base wih diced tomatoes in it. Serving was very big. Nice place and an Ohio City old timer so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"I wanted to fall in love with Heck's, but I can't say that I did. The service was good, but the food was really average. Got the vegetable egg scramble and it was just okay, it was pretty bland. I easily could have made a better version in my own kitchen, which is never what you want. I might try heck's again, but my whole table seemed pretty underwhelmed by the entire affair."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that was cool before Ohio City was cool.  Had not been there for years, but came back.  Great burgers, good menu.  Great service.  Good value.  Still a great location, would return."}
{"text":"Food is good, service a little bit slow. Drinks and desserts are the best. But the parking is a nightmare."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Heck's for over 20 years, so I have a soft spot for it. Don't let the poor reviews fool you. This is a burger join in the historical part of Ohio City with phenomenal burgers and French Onion Soup. The place is small and romantic and semi-outdated."}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting at Heck Cleveland, with a party of 6. After waiting sometime to take our order and waiting a long period of time, our order was taken. Food was brought out for 3 out of 3 of us, another 10 minutes past and we received our order which was cold. Now others at table are finishing up and I'm still waiting! Very disappointed, been to Heck  in Avon and Heck in Cleveland! Not sure what is deal, but a very bad experience :( Not sure I would pick Cleveland location again!! They brought it back again after another 15 minutes and cold again! No manager would come out, sent it back, no lunch for me! Very Sad!"}
{"text":"impressively good burgers and salads + top-notch service. also got the baked brie app and it was on point"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is in regards to brunch only.

This was my first trip to Heck's and while the overall experience was an okay one, I am giving this a two because the food was so boring and unmemorable that I would not go back to try more.

We sat on the patio which was great. This place is tucked away in Ohio City on a quiet street. I only saw the inside of the place when I walked through to use the restroom and was glad we chose the outside to sit - the inside was dark and dingy in the front room. 

I did not get a drink but my friend got a pretty solid bloody mary (I believe it was called the Hail Mary). Pretty tasty drink, but that was about the only thing that was tasty.

Both my friend and I got the short rib hash. Bland, bland, bland. No special cream or sauce. Just flecks of short rib over home fries, mixed with a few tasteless vegetables and topped with two sunny side up eggs, served with a baguette. I am pretty sure there were no spices or seasoning used in this dish. Looking back, the prices were all somewhat reasonable and now I understand why.

Also, I was starving when I arrived and still hungry when I left. This should never happen!

As far as service goes, I can't say anything bad about it. We were seated and served right away. I am thinking we were served so fast because there's not much to throwing a piece of meat and eggs on top of potatoes.

Sad to say my review is not a great one and sad to say I will probably not be going back for brunch or any other meal :("}
{"text":"First, I want to say that I love this restaurant. The decor and the atmosphere is fantastic. 

I'm bummed to be writing this review. We went in today for brunch. We ordered the baked brie to start, some coffees and water. 
Our main entrees were the stuffed french toast and the chicken and waffle.

The brie came out and it was good. However, we weren't really able to eat any of the puree because our server was Mia and she never brought us a spoon. The fruit was a bit mushy, but tis the season. 
We weren't even half way done with our starter when our entrees arrived. 
There wasn't enough room so I had to hold my entree. Really?
The stuffed french toast was good. It had a good flavor and the melon was delicious. 
My husband ordered the the chicken and waffle and didn't care for it. The waffle was to fluffy and was a bit under cooked. 
Again, our server was Mia and we couldn't cut the chicken or the waffle, so he basically had to eat it with a butter knife. 
All in all, the food was decent. I doubt we'll return. The service was awful."}
{"text":"I lived in Cleveland for over 11 years and frequented Hecks many times when I lived here.   My trip to Cleveland this year was to reminisce and visit friends. Going to Hecks brought back memories of great burgers.   Not this time.  My burger was ok, but my friend who is a vegetarian had a veggie burger.  The worst he ever had.  A bunch of shredded veggies slopped on a bun that tasted bad. He sent it back!  Service was horrible.  It was like you asked someone to get our waitress and they acted like they didn't hear you. There was no interest in helping us out. It wasn't like they were busy on a Friday night.  Most restaurants in the area were packed with an hour wait.   Their dining room was virtually empty.   I guess their time has come to move on and out"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for years. It always slipped my mind until last night but we finally got a chance to go. It was Saturday so I made a reservation for 8:30 - but it wasn't needed. It was busy by  not too busy.

We sat in a small room that reminded me of an Italian cafe - it was very cute. I ordered the Ohio City martini. It was supposed to be muddled strawberry, basil with a hint of balsamic. It tasted like cheap vodka and strawberry jello - the martini glass was also only filled a little more than half way so it was truly disappointing. I was out $9 on that. 

I was torn between a few items on the menu. The special, a black and blue filet, sounded appealing and so did the salmon. I ended up getting the sesame ahi tuna and I was NOT disappointed!! The tuna was PERFECT. It wasn't chewy or overcooked, it truly perfect. It came on top of sooba noddles with carrots and edamame tossed in sweet soy sauce. The noodles were a little saucy but they were still great. It came with a wasabi, mayo like sauce on the side. I wish it had been a little more spicy with more wasabi but it complimented the tuna.

I knew going in I wanted dessert. I opted for the chocolate torte. It was supposed to come with a caramel sauce and a spicy bacon brittle (the brittle sold me in an instant). However, it came with some caramel-like chewy candy on the side. I wish it had come with the bacon brittle but the torte was AMAZING so I got over it. I don't like super rich chocolate but this was just rich enough. 

I will definitely be going back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I had the Crab Benedict. The dish was good. It wasn't the best crab cake I had, but it was still good and I would definitely order it again. I especially enjoyed the house-fries of the dish. It complemented the taste of crab cake nicely. The service was very nice. My food took longer than usual to make, but my waiter constantly updated me and thanked me for my patience. Overall, I would say it was a good meal experience, and I would definitely come back again to try the other brunch entrees."}
{"text":"Supposed to be great for hamburgers - but they were dry and tasteless (5 for 5).  One of my guests found several pieces of glass in his (turns out it came from the small Heinz ketchup bottle they suppy with each burger (it was broken).  Very scary - they did the right thing (after he was chomping down glass) and allowed him to pick something else and deduct from the bill - but let's be more careful here.  My blackened salmon was dry and tasteless too.  No-one (6 of us) enjoyed a bite of their food.  And why was the waitress so intent of pushing us to rush in our order?  Not again!"}
{"text":"Decided to give Heck's Cafe a try at brunch after not dining here in probably 10 years. Was OK, but likely our last visit till nostalgia drags us back 10 years from now. The decor has not seemed to change too much, only instead of seeming quaint, it now seems dated and a little dingy. 

We started with some cocktails. The Cucumber Mule was a pretty flavorful version albeit not the stiffest drink. The Pineapple Coconut Mojito was fairly atrocious. I detected no pineapple save the partial rotten wedge garnishing the drink and the flavor was of sour lime and suntan lotion. Ordinarily I would send this back but my hangover dictated that I press through and ingest it as soon as possible. 

For our meals we decided on the Market Burger and the Tournedos Benedict. The Market Burger actually was pretty delicious, however it was ordered medium rare and arrived well past that point and the bearnaise sauce it was topped with had broken into a greasy clotted mess that created a pool of oil under the burger and the bun could not survive it. The bottom bun was soggy and falling apart upon first picking up the burger. Again, the hangover dictated this must be eaten immediately. Tasted pretty good in my book though. The wife deemed it \"gross\". I did mention it to our server who really didn't seem to care since I said the flavor was still good. The Tournedos which were ordered without the server asking how they should be cooked showed up with one cooked medium to my wife's liking and the second practically raw. This was addressed by our server and the second piece of meat was sent back for a quick refire. This might have been too quick, and amounted to a heating of the outside of the meat, but inside it was still way under-done for my wife. Again, my hangover dictated that I assist her and I ate the second tournedo. The Tournedos and the homefries they were served with were terribly underseasoned. And the same broken bearnaise sauce topped this plate as well, rendering into mush the Texas toast at the base of the Benedict. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly, but also not seasoned.

Overall, very hit and miss. Some components and flavors were excellent and some were atrocious due to execution. We left pretty disappointed, but maybe finally understanding why it had been so long since we'd eaten at Heck's Cafe."}
{"text":"i really want to give a 2.5 but since that's not an option, i am going with the 3 stars. 
cuz i am nice like that.
sooooo, first of all. happy that they have added on and opened up additional seating with bar area. cool. 
however, what i didn't like, were the prices. i thought our brunch was over priced for what we ordered. i was not satisfied and honestly, there are not a lot of choices. i love a menu where you can't decide what to order. i couldn't decide, but that was because there just wasn't a lot of choices. 
my brunch was kind of like pot roast in a bowl. not impressed. it was watery and just was not delicious like i was hoping for. boo. 
i have had burgers here in the past and really enjoyed, but i just was not happy or satisfied when we left. with so many dining options in cleveland, i think heck's could honestly step up their game or lower their prices. i am not one to care about paying for a good meal, but this left me feeling discontent. boo. insert sad face."}
{"text":"School sponsored dinner here--way too much food but I was not super impressed. 

Place: Cute place, like the patio area but the first park when you enter seems a little grungy. Has a not super clean feel. I think they could probably update their look a little.

Service: Friendly, attentive, no complaints here.

Food: Apps--tried the onion rings, pierogies and mussels+fries. Onion rings were generic but heavy. Pierogies were ok, I'm no expert. Mussels were probably my favorite--broth of butter/garlic and I think white wine was yum but the fries weirded me out a little. I had the ohio city burger--cooked spot on to the medium I asked for. The description of \"grilled with herbs of all nations\" was not exactly evident in the flavor profile--pretty average, probably some parsley, dunno where other nations really come into play. Also they really need some local beer on draft, have only some bottled selection. Finally, why does the menu on the website download as a word document--wish they would update the website as well, just display the menu on the webpage with an option to download as a pdf--is that too much to ask?! Maybe I've been spoiled. 

Overall, average fare, probably a little overpriced for what you get though portions are standard American huge."}
{"text":"Great food however we were in a large party (of 10) and I felt that the waiter didn't visit our table enough to take our order quick enough. Food was really good though. Came out in a timely manner"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I come here almost every week for dinner because the food is just phenomenal. The only caveat is the service is awful. We have sat at a table for 20 minutes before being greeted by our server and another time the server forgot to put our food order in. More recently I brought a friend here for lunch. When we arrived at Heck's, the host said they can't seat us without a reservation...not even at the bar, where there was open seats available citing the bar seats would overwork the kitchen staff. Not to mention, there was legit no one In the restaurant. So I make a reservation via OpenTable, and when we return we are told we still can't be seated (??). The host provided zero explanation. 
I feel like this restaurant has potential but the service needs significant improvement."}
{"text":"Cute place,  awesome staff.  Our waitress raced on the burgers,,  so we tried them.  Great taste sand huge portion.  Glad she recommended it.  The \"heck\" fries were very good.  The only problem...I wish I had room for dessert."}
{"text":"Dined at Heck's for the first time this past Saturday night with five of my friends.  Two of our party had lived in Cleveland at some point and I grew up there, so I'm familiar with the culinary offerings of my hometown. The only reason that this review has three stars and not four is because the service was remarkably slow.  I believe the restaurant was understaffed in both servers and kitchen.  It took quite a while for us to get our drinks after being seated and almost an hour to get our food.  I had the pork loin special which was okay, but nothing to write home about.  My friend's shrimp and grits, however, were fantastic.  We ordered a bottle of an Argentinian Cabernet which was serviceable but nothing spectacular.  I love the location in Ohio City and the building itself is just adorable.  I'd be open to trying Heck's again but I'd be hoping for much improved service."}
{"text":"Great burger place! The Avon burger and Ohio City burger are tasty and delicious, each burger comes with fresh French fries that are from local fresh potatoes. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Hecks for many years and have never left dissatisfied. This Cleveland tradition is even better now with the added seating and bar area. I also really enjoy their new menu items and brunch menu. There are options for everyone/every occasion from burgers and omelets to steak and seafood. They now even offer valet service which makes parking much easier."}
{"text":"I went with my family for dinner yesterday. I ordered the seared tuna with soba noodles. The tuna was cold. The noodles were one lump of tasteless mush. It was awful tasting and it should not have been served to anyone. I told the waitress and she offered me another dish. I just wanted a side. She asked if wanted some dessert too. The side never came. Just the dessert. I've been going to Heck's since I was a child. I have been there a few times since they expanded and their food has suffered. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone way down.   Small portions, lack of flavor and ingredients that were to be added to burger.  Ordered burger that was supposed  to have assorted mushrooms ..there were about two mushrooms on burger.   This reatautant has been a disappointment now twice in a row.   Service was great but owner needs to step up his game and quit cutting quality and portions"}
{"text":"I would give it 0 stars if I could. For having \"the best burgers in Cleveland\", I've never had something more tasteless. I encourage the chef to google \"salt and pepper\". I've worked in the food industry long enough to know to never send food back unless entirely necessary. Well, needless to say I sent it back. The waitress was less than enthusiastic nor did she even care that I wasn't pleased with my meal. I feel like the owners made it priority to market to 45-60 year old women with nothing better to do than eat a crappy burger and complain about their husbands."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of two times. The first time was in the summer and they had an avocado Caprese salad on the menu. Delicious! My only complaint is that I asked for bread to go with my salad and was offered a sandwich bun.

The last time I went I ordered their Rocky River Burger. It was perfectly cooked but the burger itself was just \"ok.\" It didn't seem like there was any seasoning or anything in the burger itself. The toppings on the burger definitely saved it. The fries were perfect.

If you go to Heck's and you're a coffee drinker, you MUST have a coffee while you're there. It's delicious and was the highlight of my meal during my second visit there."}
{"text":"Burgers were cooked just right and delicious! Crab cakes and mac n cheese were amazing! Coleslaw was great. Wait staff was friendly and helpful. Water tasted like copper pipe though. ick! My friend ordered the lasagna and said it was yummy! Large portions as well. I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Being in such a competitive foodie area I expected more, but the food is good (not mind blowing). I had the delicious candied bacon pierogies and a burger topped with braised short ribs (it should have been so much better than it was).
It's a nice place with a cool staff and still worth a visit."}
{"text":"Nice place in the heart of O. City. It's definitely a \"cafe\" -- not a \"high-class dining experience.\" They have burgers, beer, a fine dinner selection, and omelets that look like they took eight eggs to make.

I was there with potentially picky family members (yay Thanksgiving weekend), and everyone found something to tickle their palate, from my mom, who just wants a sandwich, thank you very much, none of that fancy stuff for me, to my cousin, who says she's a vegan but whom I caught eating brie."}
{"text":"Everytime we are in town we enjoy visiting Heck's.  The service is attentive.  The food is fresh and well seasons.  We also love how many fish options they offer.  I highly recommend the walleye.  The decor is lovely also.  #foodie"}
{"text":"Just went here today. Sat outside. The food was great! We got the buffalo cauliflower to start it was soooo good. And then the grilled cheese and a burger, the burger my boyfriend said was best burger hes ever had. Service was great also. Hand crafted cocktails were worth the price yummm!!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch.  I highly recommend the stuffed French toast.  They have a cite garden room with plants that feels airy and breezy even in the winter.  Great service everytime I have been."}
{"text":"If you want a burger come here!! Awesome service and really freaking awesome burgers with a variety of other options. Came for lunch and definitely coming back to see the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch and was fortunate to be with someone who has been there before and requested the garden room. It was absolutely lovely!

Cute cafe nestled away in Ohio city. I ordered the Wild Things which my server said was the most popular item on their brunch menu. The chicken was super tender and covered in herbs and the mushrooms and greens made for a super refreshing brunch. My lunch date got the baklava French toast. How awesome and Cleveland can you get? 

The food is reasonably priced but I couldn't believe my mimosas were $8 a piece. Yes they were tasty but spending $30 on one dish and two drinks seems a little steep. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to be severely disappointed in, it was a good stop!"}
{"text":"Been a few years since been there the coffee was on Point as always.

The meals where lacking the Brussels sprouts where burnt the cod tacos lacked in flavor and when I looked there was 2 small pieces of cod that did not cover the small shell....The burger was good  they should stay in that lane.....for what the prices where we felt underwhelmed. 

Maybe I'll try it again in a few years....."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a review like this ,but if somebody doesn't then nothing will ever change .We have been going to here for quite a while
 my husband and I have been together for 12 years and we used to go there when we were first dating. I remember the salads and the burgers being really good but the past couple times we went, things weren't as good as we remember them. For example, the last time we had a burger it was kind of cold. And tonight we decided to try something different, husband got breaded lemon chicken wich was ok but not much flavor. I got braised pork shoulder over coconut risotto, it was served in a bowl and was so greasey the grease actually pooled in the rissotto mixture. I couldnt finish it :( both meals were bland. Our waitress was ok but didn't appear very interested. I'm so sad. Hecks used to be such a fave, now its over priced sub par food. What happend?"}
{"text":"Great  place to go.   I enjoyed the  very friendly  staff . I had a chicken burger  it was very good.  And  french onion  soup. I recommend this  place"}
{"text":"Nice little spot. I had the Philly Burger and everything about it was good. The patty was juicy and the vegetables didn't overpower the meat. The french fries were hot & crisp, and most importantly, tasty without the ketchup. The garden room is quaint and a great spot for a date. Staff was friendly and extremely prompt. Less than $20 total for burger, fries, and a GOOD beer. If you're looking for a quick meal and a place for good conversation, Heck's is the one."}
{"text":"Our family moved out of Cleveland about 30 years ago, and we still had fond memories of Heck's Cafe in Ohio City. So when a recent road trip took us back through town we decided to try it out again. The back dining room with the spiral staircase looked familiar, but a new expansion provided so much needed extra space.
Fortunately, the food here was as good as we remembered - if not better. The Teriyaki burger I tried was a good choice. Back in the day Heck's was famous for it's coffee (good coffee was much less common back then) so my dad tried the coffee for nostalgia's sake - it smelled as good as he remembered.
It's great to see this place has held up so well."}
{"text":"We went to Heck's to pickup some of their delicious coffee.  We then decided to stay for lunch.  Great idea!  2 of us split the beet salad...YUM!  We each had a hamburger that was also delicious.  We'll be back for more coffee...and dinner!"}
{"text":"French onion soup was Luke warm at best. Got the steak frites medium. Came out well done. Blue cheese on top was good, but clearly steak was very well over done. Took at least ten minutes to get a round of beer. Place wasn't even busy. I think this would of all been fine if the meal wasn't ~27 dollars. Don't know how they get off charging that much. There are too many places in Cleveland more specifically the area that are cheaper and better. I say stay away if you can."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place after hearing about it and while walking by it several times while in the area.   I must say, it did NOT disappoint!   The atmosphere is great (we sat outside) as it is tucked away on a corner in a neighborhood.  Service in general seemed to be great!  We had an \"okay\" server, as she just seemed like she was floating on cloud nine.  Needless to say, she provided us with entertainment because of how she was.   It definitely did NOT impact my thoughts on this place.   EVERYTHING was still phenomenal.

I had the Burger Au Cheval ... I am a sucker for burgers with egg on it.  It was $13 which is pricey for a burger, but my goodness was it outstanding.  Next time, I will probably just do the \"build your burger\" for $10 and add egg.  Their happy hour was not too bad.  $5 for an assortment of drinks (only 1 beer) and $5 for assorted starters.   Their happy may have been better; maybe more beers, but again, our server was \"out there\" so we may have missed a few things.

All in all, this place was great and HIGHLY recommended.  I will definitely be returning and have already recommended it to friends who have not heard of it.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch.  Coffee is fantastic.  Baklava french toast goes well with the coffee.  Great bloody Mary selection.  Mimosas were delicious.  Would highly recommend for brunch.  It does get noisy, so hard to hear people talk sometimes."}
{"text":"Very good service and really good food.   The burgers were great, as well as the mushroom ravioli.  Pierogies a perfect appetizer all in all a Christmas Eve treat for the family."}
{"text":"I've been to Heck's twice now, both for large events. Heck's is very accommodating to large parties with a courteous and efficient wait staff. I was unfortunately one of those annoying customers that makes a reservation for 10 people that eventually becomes 15 on the day of the event and yet, Heck's made room for us! 

Both times here I've ordered something other than a burger, only because the dinner entrees look too fantastic to pass up for burgers (even though I've heard the burgers really are worth trying). I've tried both the Tuna Nachos and the Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna entree. The nachos have an interesting balance of sweet, spicy, and sour on fried wonton chips that satiates any nacho ordering restaurant go'ers desire for deliciously messy finger foods. It worked well as an entree but can also easily be shared as an appetizer. 

Conversely, the Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna is mild, sophisticated, and just the right amount to make you feel satisfied. The tuna itself is a little bland, yet the wasabi mashed potatoes and soy reduction worked well together to make the entire dish delicious. It's simple, refreshing, and not too heavy. 

For dessert, I was surprised with a cookie and ice-cream treat with fried dough sticks and a raspberry sauce (it was my birthday). While I found the cookie to be a little on the crunchy side (I prefer soft warm cookies), the rest of the plate made up for it. 

Overall, I had a great time at Heck's and it has easily become one of my favorite spots for large parties."}
{"text":"Had the dessert burger and what a bust! The cookies were stale and hard as a rock while the brownie was dried out... Nice concept but very poorly executed."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Heck's Cafe.  I went for brunch on a Sunday.  I ordered the bacon waffle with their homemade butter; it was delicious!  I will definitely be back to try their burgers; they looked delish as well.  The decor was really cool and had a hipster vibe to it.  I want to dine at the little table up the spiral staircase one day!  Another thing I liked about Heck's was the pleasant staff.  Our waitress was great and good at her job.  As we were walking out to leave the chefs were super friendly and asked how everything was.  It's nice when you can tell that people love their job."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Heck's Cafe today to celebrate Mother's Day.  We arrived for our 4pm reservation.  The restuarant was busy but not overly crowded. We were seated in a timely manner. We ordered our soft drinks and waited just a few minutes to order our dinner selections.  We ordered our food around 4:15pm.  We waited and waited for our food. Our actual waiter never came back to the table. I asked a female server, if she knew how much longer we had to wait, by this time it was 4:50pm.  She stated since we ordered our burgers well done, that it might take a little longer. Ok - I have heard that before (however, it is usually when steaks are ordered), but nonetheless,we continued to wait for our food and for our waiter to offer some type of explanation or even recognition.  Neither of which took place.  It was not until I noticed 2 different parties that came in well after my daughter and I did, had received their food, that I decided to leave.  I have no idea if the waiter put our food order in excessively late or if he did not want to wait on two African American women(since we were the only black people (excluding kitchen staff) in the restuarant. He NEVER came back to the table to ask how everything was going, which most servers tend to show up at the table non stop.  Nothing - the worst customer service.   But one thing for sure, I will never return to this establishment AND I will make sure that my friends and collleagues are away of the service Heck's provides.  

This was a special day for my daughter and I. Instead allowing this situation to dampen our day, we went to another restaurant, Nighttown in Cleveland Heights. The atmospher and the customer service was excellent.  I highly recommend Nighttown."}
{"text":"Super nice staff.  The food was great and good prices.  I went with a group of 6 and was very well taken care of.  My burger arrived a little late, but they brought free soup while I was waiting.  My wife had ordered hers medium and it arrived a bit more red than she expected, they brought out another one more done and let her have both.  They then brought out a free carrot for dessert which we all devoured...it was great.  Would highly recommend, as would many restaurant reviewing journals (they have them all posted in the entrance).  A bunch of these have them listed as the best burgers."}
{"text":"Just left, and couldn't get out fast enough, bland food, (with the exception of finding egg shell in my meal) bad service, and overpriced. Why in the world does this get so many good reviews??"}
{"text":"Atmosphere- you have a lots to choose from honestly. When you first walk in it's a bar setting with a bar on your right and booths on your left. Nothing spectacular. But when you walk through another doorway it opens to a broad indoor courtyard type Feel with sunroofs giving it an even more open vibe. The third room is another bar type fee but it's only used if the restaurant is fuller than usual

Service- Excellent! All the waitresses have been super friendly!

Food- WHERE TO BEGIN. The burgers are incredible and I highly recommend. They're cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. If you don't like burgers the rest of the menu is very accommodating. But remember to save room for dessert. Their chocolate hamburger sounded weird but it was out of this world!! Their milkshakes are DELICIOUS, especially their Nutella milkshake.

Price- really pretty expensive but I'd say worth it if you're looking to splurge or celebrate"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!  I am amazed at the incredible transformation this venue has taken.  Great food, great drink, great service, and cool vibe.  I have been a fan since it's infancy in the 80's. What an outstanding evolution."}
{"text":"I think any negative reviews of Heck's are probably the product of unrealistic expectations.  The burgers are awesome.  One of my 2 or 3 favorite burgers in Cleveland.  My wife and I were in the mood for something simple to hit the spot after happy hour a couple weeks ago and Heck's hit the spot.  I had a burger, she had a chicken sandwich.  I've never gotten anything but a burger, and probably wouldn't.  If you're looking for fine dining, there are plenty of other restaurants in the neighborhood that will turn the trick."}
{"text":"Another Ohio City anchor. A very unique restaurant that has successfully evolved to keep up with the progress of the neighborhood. That bright dining section that is basically an indoor garden room is intimately scenic. Eating in that place will definitely brighten your day. The addition right next to it basically has you in a different restaurant, with its dark wood and spacious modernity. 

The menu for brunch, lunch and dinner is very expansive. The brunch menu is great and I feel like I get something different with each visit. But no lie, I come here for the burgers. No question the grass fed beef burgers here are right up there in any \"best of\" lists in the Cleveland area. The standouts are the Rocky River with a heaping of mushrooms and bacon. The sour cream and the swiss cheese just put it over the top! Their version of the breakfast burger, the Burger Au Cheval, always has an expertly prepared egg on top of the bacon and cheese. Comes with sour cream too! The side of fries can be accompanied with a variety of dipping sauces - I'm a fan of the rosemary & garlic aioli. Great, now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a restaurant in Ohio City that's slightly off the beaten path, Heck's Cafe is the place for you. Located in a quieter, residential area, the restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. The menu offers a variety of drinks and the wines and cocktails I've tried have all been delicious!  I can only speak to their burgers and fries, it's the only thing I've eaten during my visits to Heck's. The portions are substantial and the food is delicious. The service is polite but not rushed. Heck's Cafe is a good place for a meal or a drink on the way home from work. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the crab cake Benedict- potatoes were soft, the poached eggs were underdone and we waited 40 minutes for order to be out. It was busy but not packed. An over easy egg was also ordered and it came out over done. The sausage had been sitting you could see the grease rings. Bloody Mary was good- wanted to love this place but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Heck's is a terrific burger joint. I had the Burger au poivre, and it was exactly as advertised. Juicy, with a slight peppercorn flavor, and the sour cream on top brightens the flavor just a little bit. Awesome fries, too. And Alex was very friendly and took good care of us.

Our setting was the neat little greenhouse room in the back. It was a little loud, but then again, there was a large group celebrating a birthday in the room.

They serve ketchup in individual, sealed mini Heinz ketchup bottles, which seems wasteful. I hope they are recycled.

And the price seemed reasonable. The 4 of us had burgers, and 3 of us each had a cocktail. It came to $68, which seems pretty good for 4 people to eat and drink."}
{"text":"A true neighborhood cafe, which was lovely and a must try! With both indoor and outdoor seating, along with additional room with their current expansion, all can enjoy a delicious meal at Heck's Cafe.

Our waiter was very attentive and checked in on us in a timely manner, along with GM, Tim. We sat in the greenhouse area, which I loved having the fresh sunlight.

The salmon dishes were amazing, you'll be asking for more. I had the Spinach Salmon salad and my boyfriend had the Miso Glazed Salmon. After having only having a few morsels of the raspberry vinaigrette left on my plate, I couldn't stop stealing bites from his spicy sesame rice cake that was paired with his salmon dish, TO LITERALLY DIE FOR!!! Trust me, try it.

You can't for a more homey feeling cafe, bravo to Heck's."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! 
Came here on a weekday night with a group of friends, I had the Avon burger and the lamb empanadas. The Avon burger was a beef burger with arugula, caramelized onions, truffles potato sticks and blue cheese. Came with a side of fries. The fries appetizer had a few different options but they let us choose an option for our side of fries, I got garlic rosemary. The burger was really delicious, I love fresh arugula! The fries were very flavorful too. The lamb empanadas were topped with Parmesan and came with a creamy (mayo based?) sauce. Nice atmosphere, there's a private room in the back you can reserve for parties. Good service, great food. Would come again."}
{"text":"4/5 for a few reasons- came here with a small group. One girl in our group was a servers nightmare, nothing was good enough and she was rude. The server we had handled it very well, as did management. The only thing that was little weird was she couldn't remember any of our orders and wouldn't write them down, so she just kept coming back asking what we ordered. Strange. Food was pretty good!"}
{"text":"I am so in LOVE with Heck's!  I had seen it on Michael Symon's Burgers, Brew & Que and knew my family and I needed to check it out next time I was home in Cleveland. 

The exterior is very unassuming and honestly looks a little divey but you walk through the restaurant to the dining area and it opens up to the gorgeous atrium style dining and bar area!  It was so surprising and delightful especially for a winter day. 

We went for brunch and the majority of us got burgers because they all sounded so good and they did not disappoint! We had some brunch cocktails, the French 75 was really good.  I got the Burger Au Cheval which has plenty of breakfast components (egg and bacon) so it served both breakfast and lunch aspects of brunch.  It was out of this world GOOD, well seasoned and flavorful beef, excellent toppings and a nice fluffy bun.  I liked the addition of sour cream instead of mayo on their burgers, it gave it a really nice tang. The fries were delicious as well. My husband got a breakfast special that he really liked and my parents got burgers that were just as tasty.  

The service was friendly and very prompt.  After leaving (completely stuffed), my husband and I dubbed this our favorite Ohio City spot.  I was hesitant to share a review because its such a gem I don't want too many people to make it crowded! ;)

We will be back many many more times I can pretty much guarantee it!"}
{"text":"Heck's is just another spot in my long adventure to eat at every brunch spot on the West side of Cleveland. It's deceivingly large and spacious on the inside. There is a sizable bar area, some standard booth seats by the kitchen, and this high-ceiling middle space. It holds a lot more people than I expected, and it seems like they can seat medium sized groups. 

The coffee is great. There is a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg which mixes it up from the standard coffee taste. It seems to be changed up a bit, so ask your server before ordering if you're unsure if you'll like it. We got a bread basket appetizer before our brunch and the various toasts are so good. The cinnamon raisin with their butter was my favorite. 

The actual meal itself was very bland. I ordered the fried steak and it was... rather mediocre. The meat was stringy and tough to cut and chew. It was also remarkably flavorless. It came with some gravy and biscuits all in one bowl. Those were good, and I dipped the perfectly roasted home fries into it instead of standard ketchup. 

Service was great. Server was always around to fill water and coffee when needed. No issues with the personnel side. Just beat the church crowd on Sunday's by getting in before 11!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 5/5

The actual restaurant is beautifully decorated and is a very interesting space. When you walk in it seems like you are walking into someone's slightly slightly cramped and dark house, but once you are able to make contact with the hostess, she leads you to a beautiful open space in the back of the structure with a lovely winding staircase that looks like something out of a fairy tale. There is also a very large and well stocked bar and a number of large TVs, making it an interesting hybrid space for if you want to come for brunch, dinner, or just for drinks and a game. 

Service: 3/5

Our server was very nice, but definitely inattentive. We were a group of 7 on Sunday at 11:30am, but the restaurant wasn't particularly busy. One person in our party who doesn't eat bacon asked for her dish to come without it, which he acknowledged during her order, but when her food came out it, there was a ton of bacon on the plate. This by itself would not have been a big deal, things happen and there's a lot going on with a large party. What really made it worse was that 6 of our dishes came out quickly and the other two took an extra 15 minutes because \"the kitchen missed a couple.\" The last dish to come out was the most basic, Ohio City Breakfast, with two eggs, fruit, and NO bacon. It was incredibly irritating to have waited a very long time for all of food to come to the table and have the simplest breakfast come out last and be wrong. The mistake was corrected immediately, but it left a bad taste. Additionally, when we first came in there was a different server taking our order for drinks, I ordered just a hot water (no tea or coffee), but when we got the checks, I had been billed $3.50 for a coffee. I notified our waiter and he corrected the change, but it could have been avoided if he had just asked the server before him what I had ordered or if he had asked me before printing the checks. Again, not a huge deal, but it added to the existing irritation that our party was feeling. 

Food: 2/5

The menu at Heck's is decent with a good number of options and a price range from 9$-16$ for brunch entrees, so it's good if you're on a budget, but still want the ambiance of a nice brunch place, this is a good option. Unfortunately, the food left a lot to be desired. I ordered the Short Rib Hash and was really disappointed by how oily the dish was and with the lack of caramelized onions. A couple people in our party got the Veggie hash which was again, more potatoes than anything else. The food on its own was just okay, but the worst part was that every single dish we were served came out cold. I could have gotten over everything else if my food had at least been hot when it was put in front of me, but it was not and when we asked for our dishes to be heated, our server took them and brought them back at the same exact temperature. 

Overall, okay experience."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Heck's accidentally and was not disappointed! The pricing is a little swanky, but totally warranted as the kitchen creates mouthwatering art and the waitstaff makes you feel warm and welcome. 

The menu items are unique and everything my table ordered was delicious. The mixed drinks were fresh and daring.

I hope to stop at Heck's again soon."}
{"text":"Great burger. Great local beer selection for a out of town visitor. And great little place in a quiet neighborhood.  

Was told to visit while In Cleveland. Ordered the Market Burger (topped with braised short ribs and béarnaise) cooked medium. Very good burger. Short ribs were perfect! Came with a side of fries advertised as malt vinegar fries but we're just over cooked fries. 

Overall, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here recently. Loved the vibe and the service was great. I had the shrimp gnocchi and my date had the sesame tuna. Everything was very tasty and quick to come out. Cocktails were delicious. Definitely want to visit again!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Cleveland. Highly recommend getting your burger medium rare if you're the type who likes rarer meats because the quality is very high. Staff is always friendly and have never had a bad experience. If I had any complaints it's that I leave too full because the food is just very good and I eat too much."}
{"text":"I love Hecks, I live next door so I get to go often. The atmosphere is so calm and enjoyable. I typically get the burgers which are some of the best in the city but tonight I got chicken piccata and that was awesome great lemon flavor. I also got the sweet burger for dessert and best thing I've ever had the cookie and the brownie were so moist and gooey and the funnel cake fries were sooo good too!!"}
{"text":"Yikes. I was really looking forward to my return to Heck's but it was nothing good. I previously visited with colleagues and enjoyed a salad but this trip for dinner was quite disappointing. We ordered the following: Blackened Salmon, NY Strip Steak, Lamb Empanadas, and Mac and Cheese.

The lamb empanadas were probably the best but they could have used more cheese. The citrus gastrique that came with the salmon just didn't pair well, the mac and cheese was bland and only edible after the cheese started to cool, and the steak was just a disaster - paired with unseasoned or otherwise flavorless veggies and not a quality cut of meat. 

Perhaps we ordered all the wrong stuff? Possibly. But we surely won't be returning to find out."}
{"text":"We had chicken and waffles where it seemed the waffle had been sitting out for a bit and became soggy. The omelette was ok but not much better. The food just didn't seem freshly prepared. The regular coffee was expensive. I think for the price point this place isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back.  I loved everything about my experience aside from  the mimosas being rather small and overpriced.  Dined here in brunch mode, but ordered two things off of their daily special menu; Bruschetta and eggplant fries.  I've never had this type of bruschetta, it was a mixture of what I believed to be green and black olives, feta cheese and olive oil on thick cut French bread.  I'm not even a fan of olives, but I adored this appetizer.  The eggplant fries had an amazing texture with a light batter on them and marinara sauce to dip them in.  I was extremely satisfied with our meal, however at the same time was so jealous of the kids next to me eating a beautiful burger and sipping on a chocolate milkshake.  I'm already sold for my next visit. 

Also, our server was wonderful.  A man who was very professional and attentive, never overbearing.  The green house atmosphere put the cherry on top of my soon to be chocolate milkshake."}
{"text":"During the first weekend of June I walked into Hecks around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon only to have an employee just stare at me without a greeting whatsoever. I proceeded to request a table for 2 and walked toward the first employee I saw, a woman. She then asked me \"where are you going?\" And continued to give me a blank stare just like the one when I first walked in. I asked the woman, \"are you closed?\" She responded saying \"we don't even have a table for two open\". One of the male employees was behind me and proceeded to tell me \"you could order food but it would take longer than usual to bring out\". I responded to them both saying I would think about but there really was nothing to think about because that is absolutely not how you treat a customer. If a restaurant is not accepting tables the best practice would be to start a waitlist and take a name. If there is a private event going on then inform your walk-ins respectfully. Practicing good customer service is not rocket science."}
{"text":"This was my first visit; my friend & I were going to Playhouse Square.  Being Mother's Day, we weren't sure if we could get in.  We were lucky to get seated at the bar.  Food was delicious !!  I had the ABC omelette, and the Raspberry Limeade with Tito's.     I believe the bartender's name was Aaron-super friendly, great drinks!

I only get up to Tremont/Ohio City a few times a year, but I will definitely come back to Heck's!!"}
{"text":"Went to this gem for my daughter's graduation dinner. It's hidden in an older neighborhood with some historic homes. The drink menu is full of unique cocktails that uses shrubs and interesting combinations like strawberry and basil. Lots of burger options as well as pasta and fish tacos. Burgers are thick with lots of flavor.  Service was excellent  and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. Great place in Ohio City."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here. All were equally delicious!!! Super friendly and attentive staff. And do yourself a favor and end with a cup of their fabulous coffee and a creme brûlée !!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place for burgers. I ordered the hecks burger that had fresh herbs on it and it was just amazing. They cooked it exactly the way I wanted it and I was in burger heaven. The fries are just as amazing as well. Crispy and perfectly seasoned. I love the interior of the restaurant as well. You feel like your in a secluded greenhouse enjoying a nice dinner. If you drive by this place you might miss it so slow down and head inside!"}
{"text":"I don't want to sound snotty, but maybe it's because I've become accustomed to service in a big city, or better food in a big city but this was a thoroughly disappointing experience.  I remember walking by as a kid, mesmerized by the ambience and the \"hipness\" of it. 

My visit was two days after Christmas with my mom and my aunt and uncle.  We usually have a great time.  Jeeez....it took FOREVER to get served  It was nerve racking!  There was a whole lotta busy but nuttin' goin' on!  THEN i realized why when I got the food!  IT was so below average (yeah, we're talking about a burger here....below average...even White Castle can't screw that up!) it was an underwhelming experience. 

The menu itself was utterly dull, unimaginative, cliche, and boring.  After dinner I was looking to see if they have a drive through window.  The onion rings barely passed muster, they were either burnt or too greasy...  Get with it guys!   

I'm really pullin' for my hometown of Cleveland...but I get thwarted at every turn!
Bummer!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day brunch. We had reservations in the garden room and I must say, this place was really beautiful. The food was great but a little pricey. $11 for just French toast and 5 small pieces of fruit? My grandmother had the short rib hash and she felt that there was barley any short rib in it. She did say that the small piece she had was good! Everyone loved their meal though."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time a few days ago. The interior of the little cafe is quite charming. Very green! It's actually very relaxing. I ordered the Burger Au Poivre with a Heck's Salad instead of fries, and the plate that arrived at my table was beautiful! The burger was nicely cooked and very juicy, not to mention huge. The salad was a nice array of spring greens and the apricot dressing was delicious. Service wasn't bad. Overall great experience here. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"We were in the area and walked into this restaurant not knowing quite what to expect. We ordered the Rocky River Burger and the Pear and Beet salad, with the Heck's Brownie for dessert. 

Beyond unbelievable. Some of the best food we have ever had.

In addition to the amazing food, the people here were some of the nicest I have met in Cleveland, everyone greeting us and a goodbye from the kitchen staff when we walked out was the cherry on top of this amazing meal."}
{"text":"I was reminded of Heck's seeing the construction occur on their newest, downtown Cleveland location, so I popped into the original Heck's to have dinner. 

The patio is right on the street, but it is a quiet street and the patio has a nice feel to it. The seating was comfortable, the umbrellas provided good shade, and as evening set in the patio was a quiet and calm space to relax with a feeling like you were on your own front porch. 

There is a big cocktail menu with creative sounding creations. I tried the New Ohio City which was presented quite fancily in a coupe glass with fresh berries and basil.  

The calamari appetizer was delicious and both sweet and spicy. The lightly fried rings were served with a sweet chili sauce and topped with scallions. 

For my main I got the chicken kabobs. There were two full skewers of chicken cooked perfectly and two skewers of grilled onions, red and green peppers and zucchini. Rice was the base of the dish with a drizzle of a creamy and slightly spicy tomato aioli over top of everything. 

Our waitress was beyond pleasant and full of smiles and always \"on\" when she approached the table. She really made the evening pleasant."}
{"text":"Their brunch is fantastic! 
I got the eggs Benedict without the Canadian bacon and it was the best I've had to date.
Bloody Mary was a little too spicy, but it was fantastic as well!!
I have nothing but good things to say and I've been recommending hecks to everyone!"}
{"text":"There burgers are amazing . They have a bunch of different kinds and flavors . I haven't tried anything else because there so good I don't even want to try anything else. Really good fries and their onion rings are huge. The food came out super fast and wait staff was very polite. They have a nice out door patio and a full bar as well."}
{"text":"Wife and I had burgers and tuna nachos. All were great. Good beer selection. I had the burger au chavel, wife had Ohio burger."}
{"text":"I've been for lunch and dinner before and it has always been great food.  Today I went for Sunday brunch for the first time and the food was again awesome, as was our waiter. Omelets are HUGE and come with fresh fruit and potatoes. Coffee is also extremely good and they keep it full. Definitely going back for all meals... only downside is that the bill was over thirty dollars for two... kinda pricey for a 'cafe'"}
{"text":"Love Heck's!!! Such incredible food. I cannot believe I just learned about Heck's Cafe less than 3 months ago. Everything I have tried so far is so delicious and the menu is full on incredible options, making it hard to pick! The environment is super cool and unique."}
{"text":"I have been going to Heck's for years and their food is always great but the past few times the service has been horrible.  There was two of us and we sat outside plus it did not seem to be very busy at all,  we were waiting to be waited on and four waitress were working outside and not one came to take drink orders or even introduce themselves, Not even a \"Hold on a moment\" for at least 15 min.  and that is not exaggerated at all.  Not to mention at least two of the waitresses walked by us at least 2-3 times within this time.  When I said something I was told that they didn't know who had the table. We walked out, I guess they didn't need that tip."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I'd been to Hecks.  I remembered it as being \"okay\" but not worth skipping some of the better Ohio City options to go to.

I've now been corrected - especially by Brunch.

They added a new side room in the last couple of years and have also since re-done their menu.  I was very impressed by the local and interesting selections.

We ordered the Banana foster and the Wild Things from their brunch menu.  The Banana Foster was honestly, delicious.  Perfectly done, sweet and banana-y with a wonderful cream cheese stuffing.  It was nicely presented and could easily compete against the best brunch french toasts.

For the Wild Things, I was hesitant because someone near me seemed to order the same thing and it looked from afar just like an arugula salad.  It was not.  On a bed of wonderfully creamy goat cheese, the vegetables, potatoes and everything mixed into a decedent meal.  

Then of course to finish it, we had their famous Hecks coffee and a Bloody Mary.

We couldn't' have asked for a better brunch.  I also really liked their new addition and think it'd be great for a birthday party/reception sort of room."}
{"text":"After struggling to find an open place to eat on a late Sunday afternoon in Tremont, my friends and I (and our two labs) decided to try our luck in Ohio City. We ended up at Heck's. Not only was the service over-the-top friendly, but they were more than happy to accommodate our dogs who hung out with us as we sat on the patio enjoying our eggplant fries and brie. Our server even brought water in bowls for the dogs! The food wasn't spectacularly amazing, BUT it was fresh and as such, refreshing on a hot late summer day. The staff was happy to answer all of our questions about the food. The salmon was wild, not farm-raised--always a plus. The burgers are supposed to be amazing, but as a vegetarian, I did not indulge. There definitely could have been more vegetarian options, but the appetizers, salad, and portobello mushroom gryo did the trick. I would recommend heck's for a casual-but-nice-cafe-style outdoor brunch or lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my last visit to Heck's. I've been here before (a few years ago) and the service and food were both great back then. On my most recent visit, my friend and I stopped in on a weekend and were told it'd be a 40 minute wait. I thought no big deal. We put our names and got a text confirmation that we'd be notified when our table was ready. We waited for about 10 mins in the front and then ended up grabbing a few empty seats at the bar. We sat at the bar and drank few drinks (not the best cocktails I've ever had). We were at the bar for well over 40 mins with two empty tables sitting right in front of us the whole time. I went up to the hostess and asked how much longer it'd be and she ended up sitting us in the tables that had been empty the whole time we were waiting in the bar area. 

The waiter didn't seem too thrilled to serve us at that point, it was after 9PM, and upon cashing out with the bartender, she almost shorted my friend $10 when she brought him the change.  Not sure if she was planning on keeping that for herself as a tip without asking  or what.

The food was good but the service was less than desirable. It's unfortunate when you remember a place being so great just to go back and be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here again bc I was dying for the tasty food again , I must say I was kinda disappointed we ordered the shrimp ceviche and it came out with literally NO shrimp so I said something then they brought another one that was just not good and didn't even have the fancy decoration it's just like they didn't care , my waiter wasn't great either. I might try them again I don't know .. I think the main chef wasn't there or something"}
