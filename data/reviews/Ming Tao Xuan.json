{"text":"Brilliant cultural experience. Large selection of teas, very affordable tastings ($5-10). We didn't buy any tea accessories, heard it was expensive. Worth trying this place in the beautiful old town."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this teahouse, and I wouldn't go anywhere else for good tea.

They serve your tea in a yixing teapot and walk you through the gongfu cha ceremony.

The tea is top notch. They have a wide selection of oolongs and pu'erhs. Definitely try the Golden Leaf, and the premium Pouchong. Excellent Tiegwanyin King too, if you're willing to pay the price.
They have very good greens as well - I recommend Yun wu, yun ya, and mao feng.

The owners are very friendly and helpful in choosing a tea for every occasion.

The shop itself is also worth a visit just to see the beautiful woodwork and all the teapots.

Great place to sit down after a long walk around old port, unwind after a work day, or wrap up a meal on a night out."}
{"text":"J'ai bien apprécié le the et le calme de l'endroit! De plus ,quel plaisir de voir tous les beaux services de the a vendre!"}
{"text":"Great place for a leisurely stop.  Didnt feel at all rushed to leave. Huge tea selection - we had a black and a green tea set.  The food was tasty (we had the tofu roll) but was a touch pricy.  The demonstration on how to rinse and pour  the tea felt authentic"}
{"text":"Drôle d'expérience que d'entrer dans ce luxueux salon de thé... J'ai vraiment eu l'impression de voyager dans le temps; de me retrouver dans un univers déconnecté de la réalité; un genre de salonnier impérial, raffiné et symbolique, à la limite du rêve... Un long tapis se défile sur un plancher de bois reluisant et nous invite à découvrir les buffets rubigineux, garnis d'artéfacts saisissants. Et que dire de ce genre d'alcôve tout au fond de du salon, méticuleusement ornementé, abritant statuettes de déités? De très belles théières de Yixing sont en vente, mais comme tout le reste de l'artisanat, elles atteignent un prix quelque peu déconcertant... Néanmoins, ces théières sont d'exception; elles proviennent du sud de la Chine et sont faites à partir de glaise pure, (sable pourpre), le zisha... D'ailleurs, elles sont idéales pour les thés pu'erh (vieillis en cave), variété très abondante au salon, car elles sont réputées pour développer davantage les arômes de la feuille.  Bien-sûr ça l'aurait été une honte que le thé ne soit pas en vrac; vous pouvez en ramener chez-vous, soit dit en passant.

Prendre le thé ici est synonyme de tranquillité. Vous aurez le droit à une bonne dégustation de thé pour un peu moins de 10$. On le sirote lentement, attablé sur les meubles élégants... Le personnel, affable, très calé en la matière (le thé est évidemment une partie intégrante de leur vie), sait très bien conseiller la saveur le plus représentative de nos préférences...

Une petit menu végétarien pour accompagner votre tasse..."}
{"text":"The shop has beautiful tea pots. I splurged and got a sweet-looking and not inexpensive set, something I'd wanted for a long time. After a month of use, the made in China pot started leaking from the bottom. I called to ask if I could get a refund. The owner said he could not do that because he would lose money. He offered an exchange, but with me paying postage both ways (I live in Vermont). I felt this was poor customer service and feel cheated. I don't want to pay double postage for a poor quality item that might leak again. The owner basically said too bad."}
{"text":"The hustle and bustle of sight seeing can take a lot out of a traveller. Recharge at this lovely Chinese tea house. After a hectic day of walking all over old Montreal I stopped by this little shop and was transported to ancient China. The tea is sublime, the cookies were delicious and tasted homemade, the ambiance of the tea house was second to none.

After half an hour of drinking and eating I noticed that I could barely hear the outside traffic of pedestrians. If you are in old Montreal and plan on seeing the Notre Dame Basilica, stop by this tea house, it is a block away from it. Refresh and enjoy!"}
{"text":"U can buy their beautiful tea sets and/or enjoy their Chinese tea at the shop using the beautiful pottery"}
{"text":"Good service and great tea. Very beautiful place with a wide variety of far eastern teas. Awesome place to go for a learning experience or if you're a tea connoisseur. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I went there twice already. 
For tea lovers, this is heaven. 
The place is well decorated. Chinese atmosphere. 
SO RELAXING. The waterfall and Chinese music. 
OH Lala. SO MANY CHOICES FOR TEA. 
Before, I had the golden turtle, which came with a turtle tea set. AMAZING.
This time, I went for the GABA dragon oolong, mainly for its muscles relaxing benefits. 
The staff helped us start the tea experience. Super kind.
I felt super relaxed. My partner too. Had a great relaxing conversation.
We also ordered cookies that was super tasty. 
Most relaxing tea place so far
Strongly recommend for tea lovers
I will come back to try other teas for sure."}
{"text":"Bon service, excellent thé, super biscuits ! On a adoré notre expérience chez Ming Tao Xuan, ça fait changement du Camellia Sinensis qui est très bien aussi."}
{"text":"This a Chinese tea room at an awesome location. You walk in and it smells so good. The decor is classical Chinese and is meant to be peaceful and zen. Complete with a little running water fountain in the corner (that will make you want to pee). 

We were sat down at a table and given an extensive tea menu, and a vegetarian snack menu. But as we had just eaten previously we didn't order any food. 

I got the Yun Wu (which I later purchased more of to have at home, and boyfriend had a light green tea.

The tea is served on a wooden tray into which excess tea is poured when the server pours your tea. The tea is presented in beautiful porcelain dishes, and everything is explained to you by your knowledgeable server. 

The tea is phenomenal, fantastic quality and definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"Came here twice with my boyfriend during our recent trip to Montreal and fell in love. The tea selection is fantastic, the staff is very friendly, and there are some very affordable tea sets here (I walked out with two different sets to add to my collection, as well as some more tea). They do a really nice Chinese tea service, explain everything to you, and don't rush you out the door. In fact, the first time we went, we only stayed an hour and the staff joked about how quickly we were leaving. The shop is extremely elegant and relaxing. 

I didn't get a chance to try the food, but they also serve a selection of vegetarian snacks."}
{"text":"This Tea house is absolutely incredible!!! We had hot tea and iced tea, both were perfect. The Hot tea was just incredible and it came with a lesson in how to drink tea properly. The ceremony as a whole is absolutely beautiful when done properly. The tea was incredible as well. I strongly recommend stopping in for tea and assure you that it will be an experience that will exceed your expectations. You will never look at tea the same way after the Zen experience that you will have drinking tea here.

Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Quaint, cozy, calming. the tea is impeccable and the staff know so much. You could also spend hours looking at the vast collection of tea pots from Asia situated in glass cases all along the tea room. The same man (maybe owner?) always serves us and he's always chipper and sweet. 
If you're munchy, their veggie skewers that look/taste like chicken will satisfy you. I don't know how they make them so addictive. Go there!"}
{"text":"A visit to this tea room is a must. 

Vintage wooden furniture, shelves upon shelves of different clay and porcelain tea sets, and walls of teas from all over Asia. If you are not a huge tea lover then it is still worth it to have a peak inside if you are in the area. 

You can order tea (with a small selection of dim sum type foods) or just buy tea leaves to go. The prices for tea ranged from $14 - $30 per 100g. They have a menu list of teas and will let you smell each one but do not expect them to actually know anything about the teas. Any question I had about things like health benefits, food pairing, caffeine levels, etc. went unanswered. Overall a cute gem in old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Come to this tranquil and beautiful setting to enjoy an elegant, traditional Chinese tea service. The extensive tea menu can be rather confusing if you're not a tea guru, but the knowledgeable and gracious servers are more than happy to help you choose. 

My only concern in writing such a positive review: Next time I go, there won't be any tables available. (There are only about 5 tables, I think.)"}
{"text":"I had never seen anything like this before! It was a bit chilly that day, so I wanted to get something warm. I stumbled across this little tea shop and asked the owner if they had tea to go. They did! I wished I could have sat down and brew my own tea. The owner was extremely nice and helpful. They were very patient with helping me choose what I specifically wanted. I also bought a bag of tea to bring home! This shop has an antique feel to it which was very unique. The menu had a variety of different types of teas with explanations for each."}
{"text":"Needed to kill some time while waiting for a dinner reservation and found this little place on Yelp.  Located on a corner in a lovely historic part of Montreal, the owners of this little tea house make you feel like you are part of an ancient personal tea ceremony. The tea selections are described in detail in their tea \"menu\". Each tea has it's own special presentation and tea pot. 
It was a wonderful way to spend a chilly late afternoon talking with friends and we were never made to feel rushed. 
It only has 4 tables so I would recommend going at \"off\" hours to make sure you get a seat and are truly able to enjoy the experience. 
I wish it was closer to home I would be there every week."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. They have an amazing selection of tea and the staff is very knowledgeable. Plus, the food is yummy. The ambiance really sets this place apart. They have beautiful wood work and gorgeous tea accouterments. If you're looking for a tasty snack and some interesting tea, this is the place for you. (Keep in mind, though, the menu is small. So, don't come here if you're super hungry or have a bunch of people)."}
{"text":"On a freezing Saturday afternoon, walking in Old Montreal, and as we were really just looking for a place to get in and warm up, we ended up here, and we were never happier to stumble upon a place we probably would not have entered otherwise. The staff is absolutely welcoming and friendly, giving you time and advice to choose from their long tea menu. The tea presentation and explanation on how to drink it the proper way was definitely appreciated as well. These people really know teas and they're happy to share it. The atmosphere set by the place with all their teas, teapots and Chinese decorations puts you in some kind of tea trance and you leave in a tea zenitude you never thought possible (yes I believe my body reacts to tea as if some kind of drug and I'm now in the aftermath of wanting more more more!)"}
{"text":"Great place to take a break and have a nice pot of tea :)

I was so surprised how many different kinds of tea they have here! There is an entire menu that describes all the teas and they have an English menu too so that's helpful for those of us who don't speak French ;) I ordered a white tea and my mom had the jasmine pearls. My tea was nice and light and fragrant, but not as fragrant as the jasmine pearls; those smelled so good!! We ordered the cookie plate as well but I wasn't a fan because they were hard and brittle. My mom thought they were alright. 

They also have lots of tea pots and cups for sale which are very interesting to look at. Restrooms are in the back on the left. The two owners are very nice and they are actually from Hong Kong so they speak Cantonese but they spoke a bit of mandarin to me which was fun :)"}
{"text":"It was a cold day in Montreal, perfect for a tea stop. My husband and I ordered cookies, and we each ordered different tea. The owner brought us each our own tea set with a thermos of hot water, showed us how to pour, how long to steep, etc. I had the shoumei white tea, which was lovely--so lovely I bought some to take home with me, along with the tea set that my tea had been served in. The cookies weren't bad. The almond cookie, in particular, was a bit on the dry side, but the shortbreads were quite good."}
{"text":"A beautiful and enchanting tea house surrounded by decorative tea pots and cups. 
The Chinese wooden cases that display these works of art are also a feast for the eyes. 
The owner and his wife are a lovely couple who attend to you with a serene quietness as they serve you vegetarian bites for lunch and an exquisite tea
 I recommend highly  the ginger honey tea. 
They have an abundance of other teas to recommend there is descriptions of it in a booklet for you to choose from. 
This is located on a side street around the corner from the Notre Dame Basilica church."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you really hope they get amazing business so they never shut down, but you also don't want them to go viral because you don't want to wait for a seat. We decided to visit the Notre Dame Basilica the one day in the year that they're closed. Itinerary fail. Thank goodness this place is right down the block. We were able to relax and just enjoy the complete zen that this place offers. It was definitely an experience I've never had before when drinking tea. If you've ever been to \"The Aviary\" in Chicago, this teahouse reminded me of The Aviary, but instead of cocktails, they do the same with tea and for a fraction of the price! My tea was ~$5 and we stayed there for 2 hours just chatting with the teahouse owner & the \"teamaster\" is what we called him. The teapot sets are also on sale for about ~$200, if anyone is interested."}
{"text":"Great decor, excellent tea, and friendly and helpful staff.  I came here to relax with a book while I enjoyed some tea and I was not disappointed!  They have a huge selection and are good about offering recommendations and explaining the differences between the choices.  I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with my experience here. I found this place on my top places to visit in Montreal list. I literally ran across the street when I randomly saw the sign.

My main issue is with the service. From the minute we walked in the place looked so authentic and cute, but the staff seemed to be glaring at everyone. He seemed annoyed that we wanted a table for three, and literally said, \"You have to wait okay! I dont know how long but wait!\" 

Someone literally left a  minute after he said that, but as we were waiting there were people behind us asking how to order tea. Both staff there ignored them and I had to turn around and explain that it there was no tea to go, and you needed to ask to be seated.

Once we sat, we overheard the staff telling the next table that everyone needed to order their own tea and no sharing. Now guys- we're not talking small tea pots- this tea was huge. There was no way my table of three was finishing 3 tea 'jars'.

I got up and asked the main guy and he said that this was true. So we ended up leaving because it wasn't worth it. He didn't try to stop us, he just replaced other people on the table and we walked out.

Usually I would consider trying three teas because of the good reviews for this place, but honestly their attitude left me with a bad attitude towards them.

Go and try the tea if you'd like but don't be surprised to be greeted by people who think they're doing you a favor by even letting you step foot in their tea shop."}
{"text":"Fantastic!   Wonderful experience. Knowledgeable waiter, kind and patient.  Must go for tea."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful conclusion to our business trip to Montreal, a brilliantly relaxing experience after all the hustle and bustle of the past couple of days.  The tea selection was vaster than anything we'd seen since our favorite tea shop in the Boston area closed, and the menu MUCH more detailed.  The tables themselves (and their chairs) were works of art, and of course all the lovely cabinets around us were filled with more lovely items.  And then the TEA came, and we were briefed on the specific drinking ritual and tea set for each of our chosen teas (I had an oolong, so I had a different set than my partner, who had selected a white tea).  We had only had an experience similar to that once before, and the lady demonstrating was so skilled and quick and informative that our previous experience paled in comparison.

When we return to Montreal for pleasure, I can guarantee at least two trips, and possibly daily trips, to the Ming Tao Xuan."}
{"text":"I loved this tea house. it was warm and charming the menu and options were vast and the tea was delicious and graciously given. I ended up purchasing a few items from here as gifts and I do plan to come back again and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area. It was a true treat!"}
{"text":"JJ insisted that we try a tea house while we were in Montreal, and I was certainly not going to argue, given that a cup of tea would absolutely bring the feeling back to my nose. We walked into Ming Tao Xuan and admired the multitude of beautiful pottery and tea sets before being shown to a table. 

I read most of the menu in detail before deciding on the Tie Kuan Yin King tea, and I knew it was a good choice by the attitude of our waiter (whose eyes lit up). A few moments passed before individual tea sets and kettles were brought for each of us. The waiter showed us the proper way to steep and serve the tea, which was fascinating, and then left us on our own to continue to drink. I poured myself three or four pots before I had my fill of the delicate and delicious beverage.

We had a delightfully tranquil time at this quiet teahouse while we strategized about what to do (and where to go) next. One final note: make sure you stake this place out, because there is a very limited amount of seating available."}
{"text":"Ming Tao Xuan is a relaxing, beautiful, well decorated establishment. My party entered about 40 minutes before closing during a Montreal rainstorm. They advised us they were closing in 40 minutes but we still decided to order tea. 

They have a huge variety of tea including herbal as well! We chose a green tea leaf and they immediately brought out the hot water and tea set. They show you how to properly steep the tea and they you follow the instructions to do it yourself 3-4 more times. 

They also serve small snacks such as buns as well.

The price is anywhere from 6 to 8 dollars per person.

The service is excellent and the place has a elegant feel to it. I will return!!"}
{"text":"I return to this tea salon almost on a yearly basis. It's more than just the tea - it's the entire experience. They always make sure to serve you as if it was their first time doing so, and as if it's your first time there (which it might well be for you!). The workers are fully dedicated to their tea making and serving. It's not just business, it's their passion. 

The variety of teas is phenomenal. My personal favorite is litchi tea. I've never tried anything quite like it anywhere else. The place itself is a haven for lovers of authentic good tea. Its shelves are full of tea, teapots and little cups. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Tea to cleanse your soul....well that's what my Mama kept on sayin'!! 

By sheer curiosity of the place (originally looking at the cupcake shop next door) we entered the Ming Tao Xuan tea house (aka: Salon de Te) and had the instant feeling of entering an actual tea house in China. The place is beautifully decorated with authentic artifacts and shelves loaded with hand-crafted teapots and tea accessories. 

A full-detailed Tea menu is brought by one of their knowledgeable tea experts who gives you a full description of any and all teas, tea properties, and advises on how to choose your tea. Teas price range from $6-8 dollars and they also have several options of cookies and light pastries as an accompaniment

The tea presentation makes this a  remarkable experience.....I can't describe how much fun we had throughout it all....Tea service is very affordable but prices of the teapots and its accessories are what could possibly break your bank. The craftsmanship of the tea pots is amazing and if you budget right, you can put together an exquisite set to bring back home and show how cultured you are! 

Hit the tea house after the a long walk around the Vieux Port and before visiting the Notre-Dame Basilica. You'll feel immensely cleansed and ready for a prayer or two at church!"}
{"text":"So glad we took a chance on this place. 

I don't have one of those fancy international cell packages so I was net-naked for the long weekend but this place looked kind of cool and advertised vegetarian cuisine so we went with it... and got super lucky with such a spectacular experience. 

It was over a holiday and their menu was apparently limited to just one page but we still managed to not be able to order less than 3 different plates. The food was ok. The salad wasn't as refreshing as I'd thought but the tofu roll thing was more of a stand-out than expected. Def get that. 

Their tea menu is pages upon pages upon pages of teas with wonderfully descriptive stories about each of the teas and their natural flavoring. 

I went with the lychee tea and it was incredible and came with a whole show, basically. I learned about tea culture and the proper way to brew and pour and it was so interesting, personal, and unique. Even though it was probably 90 degrees outside, the hot tea was still a good call for a head clearing, relaxing time in a beautiful part of downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Extremely cool place to get out of the cold and relax a bit.  Do yourself a favor and get some tea here.  The owners take pride in what they do and it is very affordable."}
{"text":"US California customer here !

If you get tired walking around and exploring all day, stop by this spot and relax with a cup of fresh tea. 

You get a table and order the type of tea leaves from a pictured menu. Then menu has explanations for all the tea (there is a lot). It's inexpensive. Eight bucks for a serving. They will bring each of you a tea set with the set of leaves you ordered. The guy will serve your first cup by showing you how to do it. Then, enjoy at your leisure. 

Delicious tea! Can't beat drinking tea from fresh leaves. It's not comparable from the packets we dump in boiled water. Great experience and the decor makes it THAT much better. 

My Wifey and I enjoyed the experience. She also made me spring the cash for a tea set and leaves. It's not a bad deal because I did shamefully compare prices on Amazon."}
{"text":"Tea ceremony outside the Basilica.  Super traditional Chinese.  I had some water sprite tea concoction and Pablo had some strong green tea.  Water trickling in the background and some delicious vege tofu wraps, really good, really soothing and a lesson in ritual.  Lots of mini tea pots to buy and take home"}
{"text":"Love, love this place! Excellent service, tea, and all kinds of beautiful pottery.  Very knowledgeable staff, so relaxing to go there"}
{"text":"Delicious steamed or fried dumplings! 1 order is $8 and comes with 15 dumplings. Your choice of meat. 

Perfect on a cold day"}
{"text":"Great place in Old Montreal to have traditional chinese tea!
There are many art and tea accessories for sale, as well as the teas which are very varied.
The choice of teas we took was different (wulong and Darjeeling) and the lady explains the way of steeping the tea and drinking them.
A bit pricey, but personally I had a great time, we were not constantly bothered or pressured to leave the place like in many Asian venues..."}
{"text":"An oasis of calm in the middle of Old Montreal's tourist trap.

Somewhere around the Basilica, Casse-Noisette (a lovely stationery shop where it is inexplicably always Christmas) and a surprisingly good cupcake place, lies possibly my favourite spot in Old Montreal.

AESTHETICS
MTX manages to be both intimate and spacious, both rustic and modern, both airy and cavernous. The space is a bit larger than you might expect, but laid out in a way that somewhat separates seating into small clusters. The glass cabinets and large windows work well with the dark wood furniture and traditional tea vessels, some of which are displayed near the entrance (presumably for sale).

SELECTION
The tea menu is a physically large book, divided into categories (green, white, black, wulong, flowering and so on). As with many tea joints, they have those large canisters displayed behind the counter, which you can request to sniff.

There's also a small food section in the menu, with pretty phenomenal dumplings, among other things.

SERVICE
You can buy looseleaf or brewed tea to go, but this place really is all about the in-house experience. The staff (who appear to be a family) will bring your tea over, and take you through the steeping procedure. In some places this can feel a bit pretentious, but there is definitely none of that to be found here. That magical ability of a server to leave you to it, but always be near when you need them... yeah they have that here.

FLAVOUR
This is definitely one of those places where everything tastes better than you can get it to at home. Tea/coffee home brewers will probably be familiar with that phenomenon.

AMBIANCE/EXPERIENCE
This is about as Zen as it gets. If you come alone, you'll be able to think clearly here. If you have company, the environment lends itself to great conversation. I used to duck in here at the end of a particularly stressful day at work, and it never failed.

RECCOMMENDATION
Give yourself at least 45 minutes to really enjoy what this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Very nice!

A very relaxing experience here! The people are very nice too. They aren't going to walk you through everything, at least not by default. Maybe if you engage them earlier they might give you recommendations, otherwise read through the extensive menu. I spent about an hour and a half here, had a great time too. The tea we selected was pretty good, not awesome, but decent none-the-less!

A large selection of tea, lots of background on it as well, but no \"special\" or real \"premium quality\" stuff it seemed."}
{"text":"After an extremely relaxing day of some much needed R&R at Spa Scandinave I decided to take a nice walk around Old Montreal and came across a cute little Tea House on Rue Saint Suplice called Ming Tao Xuan.
With an air of Buddhist serenity, it feels like you are stepping into a tea house somewhere in a Chinese village and not off the street in old Montreal.  Ming Tao 

Xuan means \"a comfortable and welcoming salon where fine teas can be enjoyed in earthenware teapots\".  What that actually means--not to sure--but the tea selection is phenomenal.  There were so many choices I couldn't keep up.  The menu reminds me of a Sun Tzu novel!"}
{"text":"En entrant au Ming Tao Xuan on a l'impression d'entrer dans un musée de thé. Ils ont des tasses et théière présentées dans des armoires en vitre. Tout ce qu'il manque c'est des petites cartes d'explications! Le focus est vraiment sur la culture de thé asiatique, et non anglaise. Un menu d'une dizaine de pages présente les diverses variétés de thé incluant thé noir, oolong, blanc, vert, etc. Vous pouvez en prendre sur place, dans une tasse pour emporter ou bien en vrac pour la maison. Certains thés sont assez dispendieux, mais considérant la qualité, ça vaut la peine. Ne soyez pas gêné de demander de sentir les thés. Les gens de la place se feront un plaisir de vous expliquer les différences entre certaines espèces et vous donnerons même quelques trucs utiles. Saviez-vous que pour garder votre thé frais plus longtemps, le frigo est le meilleur endroit pour le ranger?"}
{"text":"Big sign on the window promises vegetarienne entrees, but really there are 6 appetizers and staff could not be bothered to find out if even 1 was vegan. Not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Authentic and amazing! My wife and I enjoyed delicious traditional tea service along with mango salad and veggie buns. Then she purchased a beautiful tea set. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"This place is in such a quaint looking area of the old port.  Cobblestone and all.  Inside, you are treated to a very tea house like atmosphere.  Teas everywhere.  They also have a small menu to pair your tea with light appetizer type food.  It's nice to sit down, relax, and pretend you are a little snobbier than you really are.
The service is nice and they will chat with you about the different types of teas.  We got one of the blossom teas which are always fun to watch as they steep in the glass tea pot.
There is definitely a zen like feel to this place.  I like it a lot."}
{"text":"Service du thé ceremonieux , rituel avant de boire fait par le serveur; endroit tres calme , silencieux , reposant, boire son thé autour de mille et un tasses ;)"}
