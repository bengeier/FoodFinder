{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible. Wait time is unreasonably long considering how few people are being served. Terribly managed with very few spots for sitting."}
{"text":"Truly a culturally classic staple of Montreal they have amazing service and amazing service 10/10"}
{"text":"I love that crispy exterior that is characteristic of a real wood-oven cooked bagel, so I've eaten a number of them. I've been here a few times now and never had trouble with service, even mid-lunch. Luckily though I seem to catch them at a quiet moment most of the time and am the only one to be served. I picked up 6 bagels today and tried their spicy tuna salad as well; it reminds me of the interior of a spicy tuna sushi roll. I went home, slapped some cream cheese on an everything bagel and added some of the tuna salad on top - great combo. However, even a plain bagel is good if that's your thing, I'd probably have it toasted with butter at the very least.
Parking is really limited with the lot right in front and only a few spots reserved for this business (it's sort of a mini strip mall)."}
