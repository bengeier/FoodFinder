{"text":"The spot may not have much atmosphere, but the kitchen is clean, the service is fast, and the owner is friendly. The food, on the other hand, is fantastic. You'll find the flavor and quality of the items served here easily surpass most other restaurants in its price range and even give higher-class dining experiences a run for their money.

It's not fine dining, but if you're looking a filling meal that's satisfyingly delicious, I whole-heartily recommend this place. If you stop in, be sure to try their roast or jerked chicken, pulled pork sandwich, and/or home-style potato wedges. Absolutely recommended. Five stars!!! :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this a big fat ZERO. Giving this place a one star is pretty generous. They literally sell us chicken burgers from the frozen section of the grocery store. Cmon! I don't know how they aren't shut down by now.."}
{"text":"First off I totally agree with Jonny L,
 I am one of those nuts who drives to places to try new food or common food but in search of the best jerk chicken i drove to Airport and Derry I think 

the guy who was cooking in the back has no clue of what jerk chicken should taste like .
 
it was this bizarre tasting weird salty chicken ( I am sorry owner but you or your cook needs help :)"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The foods are precooked. I ordered a chicken with 2 sides for around $10.00 . The chef says the food is precooked and had to steam the chicken before serving. The meal including the chicken was horrible. It was rubbery, as I can tell it was steamed and not freshly cooked. Does not taste like regular baked or fried chicken. The money was not worth it. I  assumed by the advertisement outside the restaurant that the food would taste good, I was fooled. I would not ever go there again. First and the last. Huge disappointment. Just one guy works there as to why he does not have to time to cook means upon ordering. I was shocked why the food finished that fast. Won't ever go there again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the quality seems to have suffered over the years. The chicken just doesn't taste the same and my favourite wedges are soggy and oily. It seems that the owner had lost his passion and it's time to move on. Still a super great guy though and I wish him all the best."}

Lykn Chicken is this chicken joint on Airport Road that looks pretty unappealing on the outside, and not much better on the inside. It's got a pretty old look to it as if the 80's came here to die, but the menu looked quite good. They had a variety of options from fried chicken and jerk chicken to burgers and wings. The entire menu was fairly inexpensive and they have specials daily as well.

I ordered the 2 piece fried chicken with wedges. Asked for fries instead of wedges, but that would forfeit the special price, so I stuck with wedges (despite my general distaste for them anyways). The fried chicken was a bit too greasy, though it was crunchy. The chicken meat though was pretty bland and I thought it could have used its own blends of herbs and spices. Potato wedges were terrible. Fat chunks of potato that were deep fried and swimming in oil.

The burger was apparently pretty decent, but I don't come to no chicken place looking for a beef burger. Not much else to say except that I don't expect to be back anytime soon. Nothing upset me or anything, but I was hoping for some good chicken. Just didn't get it here."}
{"text":"I spent the day doing one-on-ones for a client just north of the airport.  As I was driving to the client's site, I went by Lykn Chicken (on Airport Road) and said I HAD to have lunch there today given their name (it was only a few minutes away).

It's not a fancy spot, but it's comfortable.

There is lots of choice which is all over the place ... chicken, wings, rotis, jerk, fish sandwiches and more.

I ordered the three piece Fried Lykn Chicken meal with wedges ($7.95) along with a Diet Coke.  It was okay.  The chicken was deep-fried, not battered, and sprinkled with salt.  There were a lot of wedges ... I left more than half of them.

The servers were extremely friendly and nice."}
