{"text":"Went here for New Years. Our waiters name was Dave.  He took our drink orders and orders from the prefixed menu.  Once we received our drinks, that was about all we saw of Dave.  Our starters came out and was served from the help staff.  Our waiter kept walking by without checking in on us.  We were all finished starters and then our mains came out.  The helpers cleared our dishes and served the mains.  Still no check in with the waiter.  My beer glass and water glass were empty and Dave keeps walking on by checking in on other tables and seemed to be avoiding us.  This was the he first and last time going to this place.  Way better options for that price point

If you absolutely love butter on everything give it a try."}
{"text":"The past 12 years, I have visited many Ruth Chris locations all over the USA; this one should be avoided like the plague!
I ordered a dirty Martini and it came in a dirty glass ...and with the wrong olives. Drink was not cold and no apologies were offered by our very aloof waitress. 
Surf and turf was described on the menu to be serve with a giant tiger shrimp but came with 6 sad looking pink shrimps (just like the ones in the Red Lobster TV commercials). 
My colleague crab cakes look like they were straight out of a President's Choice frozen entree box. 
Our bill was 340 bucks for two which is a total disgrace for such a substandard meal and experience. 
The Keg and Chops, a short walking distance from there, are a much better option for your dollar and taste buds."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They relocated from the Square One location and kept the same amazing staff and food quality. Highly recommend this over The Keg. (They love their butter here)"}
{"text":"Warning!!!

Do not come to this location within 15 minutes of their posted closing time as they do NOT remain open until 10pm. We arrived at 9:45pm
And they made no effort to seat us instead turning us away well before their closing time. 

Ruth's Chris---- change your posted closing time to the time you reject customers."}
{"text":"The story of Ruth Fertel is a remarkable one if you ever wanted to learn about it.  Ruth's has a loyalty program that gives you 10% of your purchase back which is good for 90 days.  I get it, it's an incentive to return and restrictive since you need to use it before your points expire.

Recently Ruth's offered a Black Friday/Cyber Monday promo that if you were to purchase up to 250 dollars of gift cards which come in 50 dollar denominations that we would receive up to 125 dollars in loyalty points.  That's a lot considering you normally get 10% on any other given time but for this promotion they're basically offering 50% (125 on a 250 purchase).  That's substantial and attractive and I ended up going with that and purchased 250 dollar's worth of gift cards on Nov 24th.  The promo said to allow for 8-9 business days before receiving the cards through the mail.

I was glad that the gift cards came before I had planned to use them which was just this past weekend (December 9th).  I had made an online reservation the same day I purchased the gift cards.  The restaurant is visible from the street  near the north west intersection of Dixon and Carlingview in Etobicoke which is basically as far west you can go and still be inside Toronto.  If you were go west about 500 feet towards the Hilton on the same side of the street you'd be in Mississauga at that point.  This location is new as Ruth's \"moved\" from their previous location near Square One to this place which is essentially part of the grounds of the Holiday Inn.

There's a parking system in place but the restaurant will validate parking for their customers and there's even dedicated ground level parking past the ticket gate as well through the structure and towards the restaurant, there's a sign stating that space beyond \"this point\" is reserved for Ruth's Chris customers.

Ruth's entrance faces the hotel's main entrance which is the north side of the building, not directly attached to the hotel.  The check in area is through the doors on the right.  The d√©cor is very modern with brighter and different colored lighting.  While the Hilton location downtown has a much more old school, big booth, classic wooden wall - library feel to it, this place really does seem to feel more flashy and new.  They are newly opened and the place isn't the downtown location which has been there for longer.  The Toronto airport location is just that, different.

The service is rather impressive however.  Between arriving, being seated, drinks, dessert and mains served, food brought out, sides being served, parking validation, loyalty card points added and payment we must have interacted with at minimum half a dozen team members.

Besides a wine menu there's a cocktail menu in the main menu at the back.  Otherwise the menu is laid out with apps and salads on the first page and then options for steaks on and other mains following.  I noticed that they didn't happen to have the satay sticks like they do downtown but we ended up going with the sizzling crab cakes and the heirloom tomato salad to start.

For mains I went with the cowboy ribeye which is a bone in version (22 oz) while the wife went with the regular filet (11 oz) cuts that we ordered medium.  The server warns that the plate will be a hot 500 degrees when it comes and knowing that the steaks still will continue to cook a bit afterwards considering the residual heat.  The family style sides we chose to go with were the cremini mushrooms, lobster mac and cheese, and creamed spinach which were all good.  The mac and cheese is larger than the other two serving trays and was good enough for the 3 of us and we had leftover as well.

The meat is high grade while the quality and cooking method is special.  1800 degree broilers and the experience to cook with that much heat with these cuts is something you have to master if you have a name to live up to and gladly they do.  Considering the average for a steak here is around 75 dollars, one would expect this to be something special and I have to say I believe it to be that.

This place does make some of the best tasting steaks I've had and it's that something special that would have me coming back for more.  Regardless of the contrasting ambiance and menu differences you get from the downtown Toronto location and this airport location the quality of the food to me is the same.  The steaks we had ordered were both very different cuts but done perfectly.  My wife and friend both said they were the best they've had and I'd also have to agree.

Between Morton's and Ruth's, I prefer Ruth's.  While they're both different with some similarities , I just like the way Ruth's cooks their steaks while their sides are very complimentary.

The area we were in was preparing for a large party and instead of being rushed out, one of the servers offered us a complimentary cocktail at the bar but I had said we were leaving anyway.  For the validated ticket, feed it into the machine, don't scan."}
{"text":"Yes I know this is a chain and your probably saying how dare I vote a chain 5 stars.  Well Ruths Chris deserves it.  At least this location does.  Newly built, and clean.  LOVE the private bathrooms.  We ordered the Bone in New York, Filet Minion, lobster mac and cheese, mushrooms, broccoli au gratin, and the onion rings.  All amazing.  But the bone in New York was bursting with flavor.   So tender and so flavorful.  The waiter was funny, and attentive.  What more can you ask for?  The onion rings were a bit too much.  People tend to give chains a lower rating and abuse them.  I am unbiased and honest with all my reviews.  Why go to a Jacobs or Micheals to pay 5 times the price for a lesser tasting steak?"}
{"text":"I have been to several Ruths Chris throughout the US and decided to give the new location near Pearson Airport in Toronto a try. It started off very promising with a nice table for four in the corner near the fireplace and window. At 1:30 pm, the restaurant was practically empty, so I assume this is not a busy place for lunch.

So we were seated and feeling good. Our waitress came over about 5 minutes later and welcomed us. She asked if we wanted bottled or ice water and if we wanted any drinks. So far so good. But that's where things went down hill.

We had asked for some bread and the waitress said someone would bring it to us. We looked at the menu and decided on lunch. We waited close to 20 minutes before we flagged down the waitress saying we were ready. We had not gotten any bread by then. We placed our order and after another 20 minutes, the food came. My guests ordered the lunch specials with steak and I ordered the steak sandwich. 

The steak sandwich was smothered with a bearnaise sauce (or something close). I took a bite and it was a bit cold, but tender. After brushing some of the sauce away, it was clear that the steak was prepared rare. I had asked for medium rare. When a runner came over to see what the problem was, I showed him the steak and he said \"that's rare\", what did you order.

In terms of staff, we weren't quite sure who was taking care of us (besides no one for the first 20 minutes). There was a waitress, a bread runner, a water runner and a second waiter. And then the manager came over asking if he could get us any more bread with an overzealous, \"I'm going to make everything better\" tone. We appreciated his effort but when he said \"the whole team is here to help you\", we had to laugh. The \"team\" as far as we were concerned were out of sight for quite a while. 

Overall my recommendation to this location and every  other place that doesn't get it, is get some bread on the guests table as soon as possible. Guests get to the restaurant hungry and when people are hungry, they get irritable. 

The Manager was nice to address the situation on the final bill, however I would never have expected service to be an issue at an upscale steakhouse. Especially when they were not that busy. I guess it's back to The Keg across the street."}
{"text":"They say good things must always come to an end. It's a very sad day when I'm no longer able to express my feelings of love for Ruth's Chris.  My recent visit will be my last.  It's not me Ruth, it's you.  


A word of advice, if you're considering Ruth's Chris, the only option should be the downtown location. We've been burned may times with the other GTA locations and tonight was another example of that.  

This location  itself lacks the ambiance and atmosphere you get with the traditional Steak house feel you get from the downtown location.  It's very nice and modern but it's far from a Ruth's Chris.  

Our waiter was very nice but again lacked the years of experience that would accompany staff from their Toronto location. 

Although this may seem trivial, the \"free bread\" at the beginning of the meal was disappointing.  I know I sound like a broken record but doesn't compare to the \"other\" location I'll keep referencing. 

We started off with a calamari appetizer that was so sweet, it reminded me of a Chinese take out dish. It's a definite pass.  

Now, I know I'm not exaggerating when I say this.  When you go to a steak restaurant that charges close to $100 per steak, you expect it to be absolutely perfect.  Unfortunately tonight BOTH of our steaks were extremely under done. The lack of follow through on the restaurant side was also extremely poor.  Choosing to re-heat our steaks vs making new ones was a poor decision.  When the \"new\" steaks came back, they lacked that \"$100 steak feel\"'. Felt as though I was eating leftovers the very next day.  We did speak to a manager that seemed way too inexperienced to be working at a fine establishment like RC.  We were offered another appetizer (pass) and some sparkling wine.  We're both non drinkers but whatever, thanks for the \"nice gesture\".  

Getting the bill was a huge kick in the nuts.  All items ordered were there as if we had the ideal experience.  

My dear Ruth, I think it's time we see other people...l"}
