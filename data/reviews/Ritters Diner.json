{"text":"Ritter's is a typical old-fashioned diner. It's cash only with an ATM inside. There's a parking lot which is convenient. Overall, my experience eating here has been inconsistent. Sometimes the food is good; sometimes I could barely eat it. Sometimes the servers are attentive and very friendly; sometimes they have a terrible attitude. I've had delicious meals, such as the breakfast items, sandwich melts, and honey-dipped fried chicken. And while breakfast is usually solid, lunch and dinner varies.  For example, my most recent trip here (a few days ago) was dismal. My friend ordered pierogis like he always does because they are usually very very good, but this time we sent it back for some butter because it was bone dry. When it was brought back, there was a small hair in it. I ordered a grilled chicken salad; it's hard to screw up a salad but Ritter's managed to do so. Yes, the portion was huge, but I found yet another hair in it and there was a pool of water at the bottom of the bowl.   My tip is to order breakfast foods because they don't mess that up and it's good. Going in during the day seems to bring about better service and food.  Even though eating here is a hit or miss, I have a feeling I'll be back to try my luck. It's one of the few places open late after the bars close, so..."}
{"text":"How does this place even stay in business. It's disgusting. The food is crap. Everything is filthy. All the waitresses look like crackheads. They screwed up a club sandwich & fries. How is that even possible?  It deserves negative stars for sucking so badly."}
{"text":"I took my family of 7 here on sunday 11/9. We arrived at 11AM and by 1:20 we had not received our food. This is after ordering over and hour ago. We noticed the table around us received their food even though they had been seated after us. The waitress was very nice and said she was sorry for the wait several times. I finally asked to see the mgr, who I assume is the owner. He finally came to our table and after I explained the situation to him all he did was said that he really cares about his customers and if he made all his customers wait this way he wouldn't have any customers then he walked away. He did nothing to compensate us for the long wait. I go here because it is convenient for everyone. The food is just so so. Well this will be my last visit. I understand everyone can have a slip up but it is how they handle it to make the customer feel better. Ritters gets a Failing Grade in this category and an OK for the food."}
{"text":"Awesome late night food. Specialty omelettes are well worth the trip.  Ritter's is still a favorite after all these years."}
{"text":"Our local diner for all the Oakland students.  The breakfasts are large and tasty especially for the price, but the food really isn't anything super special.  That said, it's a fantastic place to stop in on those late nights when you've been out having a few and are in the mood for something greasy.    Service has always been friendly.  Biggest downside is that they only take cash, but you can use the ATM they have on-site if necessary."}
{"text":"We came here for a casual brunch and were pleasantly surprised. Service was slow as we expected, but we weren't really expecting much so I guess it didn't make that much of a difference. They didn't have the fried green tomatoes that we wanted to try...oh well. The food we did get made up for our brief disappointment. We had the greek hobo omelette (how could you not want to try something called a greek hobo omelette??) with feta cheese, as well as a stack of buckwheat pancakes. The omelette was really flavorful, and actually tasted like a greek gyro as stated in the description, especially with the yummy tzatziki sauce. The home fries were awesome - perfectly crispy browned layer. Buckwheat pancakes were pretty decent as well, and the syrup was nice and buttery. We left glad that we had decided not to wait in line at Pamela's!"}
{"text":"I think Ritters diner is one of the best diners in Pittsburgh great food great service and lots of laughs from the food servers the peanut butter pancakes are my favorite so if you want a good breakfast Ritters diner is the place to be"}
{"text":"Love places like this. It's exactly what you'd expect and you can't beat the greasy diner ambience. Solid breakfast (not revolutionary, but tasty) and reasonably priced! Don't expect super peppy waitstaff or to be checked on every three seconds (which works for me, a little surliness just adds to the experience). I love you Ritters! I hope to dine with you many many more times!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch. I think everything is good there. Got a lamb gyro, a good alternative to burgers. Great wait staff very friendly but not in your face \"friendly\""}
{"text":"The fried green tomatoes are delicious- just perfect.  Overall, such a fun, charming, and delicious diner with an extremely accommodating wait staff."}
{"text":"This place has all of the important elements I think are required in a diner: 1.  Night waitresses who have been there longer than you have been alive. 2.  A full selection of meal options, from breakfast to dessert, many fried. 3.  A 30-second pie listing. 4.  Jukeboxes at each booth. 5.  Regulars. 6.  Space for as many people as you can get there at 3am.  It might not be the best food in Pittsburgh, but sometimes it's important to go to a place where the waitresses call you \"hon.\""}
{"text":"Okay, the food isn't wonderful -- but, it's pretty good AND it's cheap! I must admit I always stick with the breakfast-y menu items, but I'm such a fan of this place! You gotta appreciate Ritter's being open 24 hours. Where else in Pittsburgh can you go at 2 AM and get some comfort food (or something to sober you up)? I've been here at all hours of the day, and the crowd is always interesting... and so are the waitresses.  Ah, I love it! There's just something special about Ritter's."}
{"text":"Not like I remember.  I had a Denver omelet today. This was a return visit after many years. The omelet had a small eggshell in it. The veggies were few. The ham was nearly absent. I asked for cheddar cheese. What was put on was a cheese sauce. You know. The kind of lousy tasting cheese sauce you get at the ballpark with the nachos.  The waitress was pleasant and service was prompt.  The atmosphere is far out dated but reminiscent of a diner from the 70's. The restaurant was clean and tables were bussed adequately.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is great; however, it is not open 24/7. Huge disappointment. It was late at night, went there thinking it is the only great restaurant that is open, but found it closed. Why would you put a huge sign saying that the restaurant is open 24 hours, and on the other side it says it is only open 24 hours in Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday, but when I went there late at night in Sunday, it was closed? How confusing. It is not really that difficult to inform a customer of the opening hours. Anyhow, I will probably still go there for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have only really been here late night so keep that in mind  Ritters is located within walking distance of the bars in Shadyside and Bloomfield and unfortunately it's the only place open  at 3am. As such I have been here more times than I would ever want to...  If I were blackout drunk cooking on a George foreman grill I could make better food...  If you like your eggs served in a puddle of miscellaneous  kitchen liquid, or bite into a chicken parm sandwich and have the breading slip off of the entire piece of chicken this is your place!!!  Though I could list the horror stories I have experienced I will concentrate on one that summarizes this diner....   Friend orders a milkshake... Only gets the glass and not the residual leftover in the mixing metal cup... He drinks it rather quickly and wonders if the leftover will ever come... So he waits and waits keeps looking at the counter where the leftover bit is just sitting there... 45 minutes later waitress finally walks over to it, drops a little bit of icecream in it mixes it... Puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else.  We called it the circle of milkshake life...in that every milkshake is half old half new.  People keep coming back perhaps because they like the little nickel jukeboxes or because nothing else is open , I have even heard it being called a Pittsburgh culinary institution... I'm sure the brothers primanti, Pamela, and the delucas  are rolling over in their graves... If they are Infact dead.  What's sad that though I am downright disgusted with this place at times,I know that I will return one drunken night ... Fml"}
{"text":"Quintessential diner complete with in-booth mini-jukeboxes, waitresses in diner aprons and cheap, good, simple food.  Go early, go late, go REAL late - it's ALWAYS open.  Located on the borders of Shadyside, South Oakland, Friendship and Bloomfield it serves the likes of college students as well as the eldery.  Used to live around the corner from it and went weekly."}
{"text":"Service was ok, food was pretty unappetizing, I think this place only gets hyped excuse it's 24 hours on certain days of the week. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Cheap price for GOOD food! Ordered the fried chicken, my mom got eggs and delicious pancake! Good and friendly service- came on a empty Monday night :)"}
{"text":"Ritter's is always good time. Good food and good people watching. Plenty of places to park in the parking lots. Had the grilled ritter's sandwich and it was yummy. My mom had the tuna salad sandwich and said it was good but she's had better."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the true, old diner standard, with friendly waitresses who call everyone \"hon\", jukeboxes at each table, and greasy spoon food that arrives at the table mere moments after it's ordered.  Regardless of the time of day I visit, I've always eaten breakfast at Ritter's, and it's always been good.  Around 1:00 AM, the after-bar crowd shows up, and around 5:00 AM, the plumbers and handymen arrive.  It's always people-watching time at Ritter's."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the foods great, but when there's only a handful of booths full it shouldn't take an hour and a half to get breakfast. If you get to the point that you'd rather leave and go to McDonalds just so you can eat something it's too long of a wait."}
{"text":"At 2am on a weekend night, the clientele is colorful, the service friendly and the food...well just forget about the food.  The food ranges from mediocre to bland.  Just be grateful there is a colorful place to go for a late night meal."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood, and decided to stop at Ritters for a late breakfast. Parking isn't fun since it's either on wild Baum Blvd. or parking in the Ritters cramped lot across from the diner. We hit the 11:00 crowd, but were seated in under 5 minutes. The waitress was friendly, even though she was keeping up with a few other tables in the section. I got the 'new' Greek gyro omelete which was good, the homefries were standard potatoes, a little bland, but okay. The vanilla milkshake was great, and was exactly what you'd find in an old diner. The wait for the food wasn't too bad, considering the crowd size, and the food was good, nothing too extraordinary."}
{"text":"Your standard, no-frills diner. Open all day err day, coming here is practically a requirement after a night on Walnut Street. Even during the daytime hours, I prefer Ritter's to Pamela's. Ritter's is spacious - no matter what time I show up, I've never had to wait. It's not anything to marvel at, but it's diner food, and you're getting exactly what you think.   Their menu is typical diner food, but more expansive than most - I was a little surprised to see seafood options. Ultimately, I always come back to the corned beef hash. Exactly like canned corned beef hash in every other diner, but that's exactly what I'm looking for. I also occasionally order the wings because Ritter's makes them the way I prefer - freshly fried, naked, with your choice of dipping sauce on the side. I've occasionally tried to branch out but find other dishes lacking. The meatloaf was dry, lacking in flavor, but still a very heavy dish; the burger was even dryer and was served deconstructed - in a bad way. However, friends have had the differing variants of the pancakes and enjoyed them.   Overall, the cheap prices (yet cash only!), 24 hour convenience, and rectifying my late night munchies get Ritter's a thumbs-up in my book."}
{"text":"Ummm, we're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here. That was the last thing we had eaten for hours, and the next morning he DEFINITELY had eaten something bad after waking up... yikes."}
{"text":"This was some of the worst food I've ever had.  If this is someone's idea of nostalgia, nostalgia is a term I'd like to forget, and the reality is more like nausea.  Their greek soup (tasted like Campbell's chicken noodle flavored with lemon) and nasty lamb gyro douched with cucumber dressing will likely haunt me as long as I live.  For anyone looking for a good nostalgic diner experience, i can't make a recommendation because I've yet to experience one, but at least in this case, leave the past where it belongs."}
{"text":"Worst food in Pittsburgh. That's all. I have been there twice, never my choice, I had tummy ache both times. I think the food is boring. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with non-gourmet food, but Ritter's, is just \"blah\". It also was an unclean feel at times when you are seated and you look around.  They are cash only also. That doesn't both me at Pamelas, because the food is oh so delish. Here, you are just wasting you apetite on food that has TONS of rooms for improvement."}
{"text":"Ritter's is amazing- for what it is: A big, Greek-ish, old fashioned  greasy spoon diner with A LOT of character.  Granted I have been and will only go here for a weekend breakfast, (or maybe I would go after a night of drinking- since it is open 24 hours.)    It is also walking distance from my house- so that makes me a little bias.  I always order a Greek omelet of some sort, and eat half of it and am stuffed, so take the other half home.  The servers have all been there for awhile I'm sure- but are still friendly and not too bitter.  OK greasy spoon diner- especially because I can walk there."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a throwback.  Whether you come in here at 3AM in a drunken stupor or 7PM for a quick meal the food is fantastic.  The breakfast items are all pretty standard but I do enjoy getting it sometimes for dinner.  Some of the other things you must try are the grilled chicken on a pita or the diner burger.  The menu is large and I constantly flip through it even though I know it like the back of my hand.  The service is usually very good and I love the quarter jukeboxes at the tables."}
{"text":"Best eggs in the 'burgh.  Actually, probably the best eggs I have had anywhere.  They cook them well and I dont know how, but they are more flavorful than anywhere else.  The prices are reasonable, it is large so seating is usually not a problem and it is open 24/7.  What is not to like about a diner that is open all the time?  The menu has a wide selection of non-breakfast fare and everything I have tried so far is maybe not the best in the city, but is surprisingly solid."}
{"text":"What you expect out of a 24 hour diner.  Food can be pretty good, service can be pretty bad."}
{"text":"Zero , service was terible... i know food i love food but i have honestly  had better food out highway restaurant bathroom than what was served to me today."}
{"text":"Yinz!  Spending 3 days in town I had learned about this quirky PGH linguistic tic, but I only heard it spoken here.  That alone makes it a Pittsburgh gem.    Classic diner fare, quick, cheap and cheerful.  What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Just popped in to Ritters for a late night dinner. It's definitely a step back in time. Shirley, our waitress, was really nice, funny and helpful. Upon her recommendation we each had the Hobo omelette which is filled with a gyro's meat,toppings and sauce. It was excellent! The side of home fries were crispy and delicious! Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Rittes is a classic old style diner in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  It has great diner food and of course great breakfast.  It has been a well know sober-up place for years."}
{"text":"Great diner !! 4am or 4 pm great food , workers are down to earth never bad service .."}
{"text":"I only get back in town once a year.  I usually love this place but today was disaster.  Over an hour for food, wrong orders, incomplete orders, delivered in pieces (eggs then toast then pancakes), ice cold, and a few items never came.  All 6 of us agreed that one of the worst dining experiences."}
{"text":"Not bad steak, eggs & homefries (real good). Rye toast. Water tastes like rust but had Oj/grapefruit mix. Typical diner."}
{"text":"Went back today.  Got the Diner Burger (4.95 w/ fries),  and a Coke (didn't have pepsi). When I went to the register,  the price was 9.42 - a 1.42 more than I had! I told the lady that I would return with the change,  but still. There's no way that the price should have been that high! Unless the soda was $3, that's ridiculous! I'm assuming that they put a tip on the bill. They shouldn't force things like that.   The food is good and all,  but the money issue left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I have to show Ritter's some love. I've been here more than 3 times in the past few months and the service each time has been exceptional. It's old fashion, but there's something comforting about it. The coffee is very good, freshly served and hot! The food is served promptly, fresh and hot. I've ordered the fish sandwich twice, along with fries and once with onion rings. The fish is crisp and not too battered up. The hoagie roll was soft and lightly toasted. They also have the best cheesecake. The portion are generous as well. I always enjoy the food and visits here!"}
{"text":"People call it \"Critters\" for a reason.  The two times I've been there I was unhappy.  It's cheap, but the food is also gross and you don't get much of it (thank goodness!).  Very small toast, cold hard pancakes, and adequate dippy eggs was what I received last time I went.    Oh, cash only too."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this by saying I am not one to go out of my way to write a negative review and am really easy to please. Nevertheless...  A few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food. We went to Ritters because it was literally the only place open within a 5 mile radius and we were starving. Anyways, we made our way past the pack of chain smoking waitresses on the front steps and were seated. Every surface in this place is covered in a thin layer of oily grime. It's clear that cleanliness is not a priority here. Your hand will stick to the table if you touch it. And the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie Saw.  The waitstaff didn't even pretend to be friendly and honestly looked like they just rolled in from a halfway house. Also, our frail, elderly waitress was clearly extremely ill and really shouldn't have been handling food. The food itself was pretty terrible, but it's a diner and the only option around after midnight, so whatever.  We got the bill and proceeded to the counter to pay. The little old white-haired curmudgeon who I guess runs the place shuffles over to the counter, rips the bill out of my hand and says \"Give me $28.38\". I politely ask if we could pay separately (there were four of us). He grunts something inaudible with a sourpuss look on his face and I ask him to repeat himself. He then raises his voice and rudely says \"Give me $28.38. I don't have time for this, I'm very busy\". It was 1:00 am, there were maybe 10 people in the entire place, and all he was doing was sipping coffee at the counter. He could have just said \"Sorry, we don't split checks\" and it would have been fine. No need to be nasty. He's like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld but not nearly as funny. You shouldn't be mean and condescending to your customers if you want them to return. I know that neither I nor my friends ever will."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what it should be: good greasy spoon diner food. Bougie foodies with high expectations stay calm! I've only had good food here, and I always leave stuffed and satisfied. The Greek Hobo omelette is my absolute favorite. If you get coffee, the only way to get the most bang for your two plus bucks is to get a few refills while you're there. Other than that, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a diner."}
{"text":"This is a typical diner but I was less than impressed. I went there for breakfast and the food was what I expected, okay but nothing to write home about.  The wait staff was pretty moody and not very helpful. I ordered an ice tea that was absolutely rancid-cloudy, tasted awful, and had most likely been made the week before.  Pancakes were ok... But that's really all I can say about this place... there are too many other great places to go with nicer servers in the area than to return to here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live within walking distance of Ritters and seem to stop by every other weekend after my late nights of Uber driving. Getting there around 3:30AM the place is always bustling. I like the energy and definitely need some good American diner food after driving around the same bar crowd that's now at Ritters. Late nights on the weekend are typically louder because of the drunk crowd but I've seen a stern woman playing Mom for these kids mandating that they cannot squeeze 4 into a booth seat. In my guess over half of the guests at the time had been drinking that night, harmless college aged kids and young adults for the most part.  The staff are always great to us, perhaps just relieved they don't have to deal with more frat bros and party girls. My girlfriend and I are always treated very well, one waitress even comp'd us an extra order of mozzarella sticks lol thank you! As for the food it really is that classic warming diner food that makes you feel good before bed (or nap time!) My girlfriend always gets the reuben and it is honestly fantastic. I get the Southwest Burger and it's just the best balance of BBQ sauce, onion rings and burger patty.   An iconic classic diner with genuine staff, I really enjoy going to Ritters time and time again. Do bring cash as this is a cash only diner. 5-stars Ritters, see you this weekend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get traditional diner food! Ritters has been around for years and they have not changed one bit. If you are looking for a fancy dining experience, look elsewhere. This is as diner as they get!  The food selection here is vast. While I've only ever visited for breakfast or lunch, their food is as you would expect. Breakfast is cheap and delicious, with options varying from omelettes, pancakes, grits, and breakfast meats. The portion sizes are quite large and make for a super filling meal.   Ritters is not usually overly busy and I've never had problems being seated. It is a cash only joint so be sure you have some on you. Otherwise they have an ATM at the front you can use. Parking is pretty easy with street options as well as a parking lot of patrons. If you love diners, this is the spot to be!"}
{"text":"Now I know I'm about to come across sounding like some man-from-Mars or a guy who eats nothing but cucumber sandwiches with the crusts cut off, but what I mean to sound like is a guy who just got hit in the face with a wave of nostalgia and appreciation for a tragically dying thing: the traditional diner.   Conjure up in your mind the image of a perfect diner: Booth seating. Open late or better, 24 hours. Breakfast served all day. An eclectic mix of patrons. Waitresses that call you \"darlin'\" or \"sweetie\". Bottomless coffee. A certain fragrance mix of fry oil and cleaning product. Cheap prices and fast service.   And there you have Ritters. As I sat and enjoyed my eggs, bacon, toast and coffee, I saw all of these elements uniting in near diner perfection. Add to all of that a stream of customers all of whom the staff seemed to know by name and greeted with smiles, hugs and good-natured ribbing. The only thing missing that would make this place the pinnacle of diner-ness: the rotating pie case.   I can't speak to the dinner fare but come on, if you're not ordering basic breakfast at a diner, you're missing out on one of the great comfort food traditions in these here United States. Get a mess of eggs and breakfast meats, some toast with too-much butter and a coffee, pay $10 for it all (pay up front! no new-fangled credit cards accepted! wow!), and sit back and enjoy this wonderful slice of life. Pie optional."}
{"text":"I probably was there between shifts or they had to slaughter a pig to make bacon. But seriously forty minutes for a BLT was a bit much."}
{"text":"Got exactly what I expected from retro-feeling diner like this one. I was starving and really needed some food in me, and it was comforting and satisfying for occasions like this just the way it should have been.   I got a bowl of chili, pork chop and eggs (with toast), and some tea. Everything was fine. Nothing spectacular, but I mean... it's a 24 hour diner. Everything was well-cooked and tasted fine.   Minor complains include the cash-only aspect, the fact that they prebutter your toast (I never had a place not ask or just give it on the side tbh), and that nothing is seasoned! I hate trying to pour salt out of a shaker on luke-warm food and having the crystals not dissolve into the food or the food be salted evenly.. but if that's what you prefer...   I don't come here often and was stuck in the area waiting for an appointment, so this was a good breakfast. Dependable diner food exactly what I expected - comforting, well cooked, and it'll always be there 24 hours a day! The people seemed like regulars and the staff always joked around with them... it's a nice environment for a morning/late night meal (my usual diner hours). Maybe they'll even season your food and not butter your toast if you ask. Definitely better than any food I'd had at Eat'n Park at this hour."}
{"text":"Excellent late breakfast this morning after a Dr apt.  Very large and diverse menu, I will be back. Great food, good prices and excellent service.The Greek lasagna sounds amazing from the decription in the menu. It's been open since 1951. Can't believe it's right down the block from where I went to nursing school and I never ate here."}
{"text":"Ritter's Diner Menu - http://imgur.com/a/ISC7b (They don't have a website or a menu online, so I uploaded one on imgur).  I just went to Ritter's, if for nothing else than to put a menu online for everyone to see. Yeah, that place is that old and that outdated.  My Order : Eggs/Sausage/Potatoes/Toast, Fried Chicken and French Fries and finally, Chili Cheese Fries.  The good: - They have parking, though their lot is a bit odd. No parking = no visit from me. - The eggs were pretty good. Can't say anything bad about them and they were some of the better eggs I had.  - The potatoes/home fries were also pretty good.  - I really like the consistency of their french fries. Their fries are long and taste good. - The breakfast prices are reasonable. - They do have a wide variety of options on their menu. They have seafood, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak, breakfast food, ice cream and other stuff.  The bad: - It's 2015 and they have no website or menu. Think about that. I have no idea how they could ever find customers not from the local area. They could put up a website for free and a menu as well. It would take less than 1 day of their time. There's restaurants from third world countries that have menu's online. - They want $1.75 for cheese on their eggs. I can almost buy a full pack of cheese for that price - The fried chicken is so so, but they want $7.70ish for one chicken wing sized leg, a mostly small breast and an even smaller leg. Not worth it at all, since you can get a better deal at Popeye's or KFC, who I both find expensive. Their chicken is better too.  My friend got an omelet of some sort and seemed to really like it.  Would I return there? I could see myself returning for a quick breakfast once in a while, but I don't see myself going there for dinner.  Recommendation: I can't say I recommend you going out of your way for this place. There's really nothing special about it, but they do have a wide variety of options on their menu, parking and the breakfast prices are reasonable. It's no Peppermill(a chain of diner restaurants in the west that are fabulous) though."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Ritter's for quite some time now. For awhile I would go there every Saturday morning before I went to work on Walnut St. I almost always was in a bit of a hurry and never had much of a problem making it to work on time as the service is usually pretty quick even though it gets crazy busy for weekend breakfast. I almost always order steak and eggs for breakfast as they have one of the best ive ever had and its reasonably priced. I have also been in here quite a few times for lunch and dinner with my kids. The menu is gigantic and they really have sonething for everyone. Ritters is not just a diner, its more like a cornerstone of the neighborhood, or an instution rather. Its been open since practically the pre-historic era, and with good reason. It truly is that old school long standing diner without any frills or attemept of being hip. Its one of the last of an unfortunate dying breed. Service is always great with a little bit of that \"kiss my grits\" type of attitude. Hands down the best diner and one of the best resturants in the city!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Ritters Diner since I was a small boy and now I take my own son.   Ritters is the best diner in the city of Pittsburgh by far!  It not only has the best home fries in the world, it offers tasty Greek food as well.  Burgers are only like 3.75 or something.... Where can you beat that?"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Nice shapely ladies. Will be a patron of again. Just don't get anything with cheese. It seems like faux cheese."}
{"text":"I'm kind of upset that it took me this long to discover Ritters Diner. My parents had told me about it, but as I'm getting ready to leave Pittsburgh, I finally dined here. Perhaps the best thing about it is the hours. It's hard to find restaurants in Pittsburgh that are open until the wee hours of the morning. I ordered a bacon cheesburger with fries which were delicious. The restaurant is rather old-fashioned with the booths, but very clean. My friend ordered mozzarella sticks. It was the perfect meal and very quick. Just make sure that you have cash on you."}
{"text":"Horrible excuse of a slop house. DONT EAT HERE!! Food recooked and disgusting. There are many other choices on the Pittsburgh area. Do NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE AND EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Ummm..... so I will just be upfront and say that the few times I have been here I was at least a few drinks in, but this is an excellent place for cheap diner food and is fortunately open late into the night. I'm from the south, so it is very reminescent of Waffle House- which is awesome. The waitresses are nice and understanding of the state that some people come in at 3 in the morning, and it will always be a place I look to when I need greasy breakfast-type food. The hashbrowns are particularly amazing. From what I remember, it was cash-only, so if you go out make sure to have the moneys on you!"}
{"text":"First time here. Had an upset stomach and wanted some plain toast and scrambled eggs and randomly hot chocolate? Who knows why. But came in and sat down at the bar around 930, immediately was waited on and had hot chocolate in front of me in 30 seconds. Ordered eggs toast and bacon at 934 and it was in front of me at 939 plus some classic breakfast potatoes for like $6. Awesome value. There was an angry guy a ways down the bar from me on the phone but it was more comedic than anything that he had the energy to be that angry in public so early in the day lol all in all great classic diner atmosphere and the waitress Heather was really nice. Solid Pittsburgh breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Ritters is, for me, the definition of a diner.  If you go early an old grandmother will serve up a sloppy egg breakfast on plates that you can't be sure if they've been washed more than twice.  Go late night and you can join drunk college kids and \"the ladies of the evening\", just be warned that someone may have painted a section of the restroom with a fine layer of regergitated food (\"hey, is that creamed corn\").  Say what you will about Ritters, it is a place full of character and full of characters.  Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Amazing little diner! My girlfriend and I went here one night a bit after midnight for some late breakfast. It was just like my small town diner. Huge array of different food on the menu. Polite waitress, they don't take card but there is an ATM here. Try the peanut butter pancakes!"}
{"text":"24-hour diner.  The food isn't overwhelmingly good.  It's been around for a long time.  Anytime is a good time to eat there.  Go after 2 and watch the drunks stumble through their meal.  Go in the morning and catch some early birds or old regulars scarfind down a cheap breakfast.  The servers are as pleasant as one can be when working at a 24 hour diner.  It's near UPMC Shadyside, located close enough to Oakland, and right by Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Sometimes this place is a hit or miss... Unless you get breakfast related items, then you're good to go. They're desserts are delicious too!"}
{"text":"We went to Ritters back in the 70. The food was good .Just went back 2 weeks ago What happend .the food was not so good When was the last time they cleaned there coffee pots Back in the 70 Would not go back"}
{"text":"The best diner in Pittsburgh (if you think it's Pamela's then you are very, very wrong).  I wouldn't recommend getting anything other than breakfast or maybe a burger, but those two things are more than enough for a 4 star rating.    But maybe the best part about Ritters is that the wait staff wears scrubs."}
{"text":"I have been going here before they were in this building. Always predictable. Nice fish sandwich. Never greasy, big and tasty. Fries are ok. Pastitio was good. The black forest cake was fair and a bit dry but oh! the rice pudding! Always a winner! You won't find any other standouts here but a solid meal and good service"}
{"text":"Best liver and onions with mashed potatoes and gravy ive had in a long time.    Waitress very nice and gave us good attention.   Owners cold busy running things and cracking the whip.   Too busy at that to be friendly to customers. Ah nothings perfect."}
{"text":"Oh, Ritters. I had heard of you for a long time, but simply never made the trek out your way - until yesterday! I had a chance to dine here with a number of other Yelpers, and I think we all absolutely loved eating here.  Firstly, I'm in love with their menu - a lengthy list of America's classics and favorites with a few extra non-traditional additions just for good measure. Choosing what to eat at this diner was my biggest challenge of the past week. I eventually settled on the Greek Hobo omelet, which is a delicious mix of gyro ingredients that comes complete with a side of Tzatziki sauce to go with the ensemble. Add in the amazingly fresh hash browns and heavily buttered toast, and I was served up quite the feast. And I devoured it like the happy glutton I was!  Not only did the food leave me happy, but keep in mind that my group was a group of over 10 people - all of our food was at our table within 15 minutes of ordering. And based on the comments of \"that's delicious\" that I heard all around, that speed is all the more impressive due to the quality of the food that was produced.  I will definitely make the trek out to Ritters again in the future - especially now that I know that they have their own parking lot, as parking is the biggest reason I don't venture to this part of town very frequently. I need to try a few more things that caught my eye on their awesome menu. (But next time I'm definitely remembering cash, as they're cash only, and I admittedly don't want to pay an ATM fee to get cash in their main room every time I eat here.)"}
{"text":"I love Ritter's!!!!! Probably the best diner in the area. It has a move home-y feel than Pamela's or any other diners. All the locals go here. Their food is delicious and the price is very cheap. The service is incredible and everyone there is super nice. I take my parents there every time they come to Pittsburgh! Can't recommend this place enough. The omelettes are huge and so tasty. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Ritter's probably about once or twice a week now, usually around 3AM (yes, the best time to go to a 24 hour diner). I get a grilled cheese and fries every time and he now gets the patty melt every time, though he went through a few other dishes before settling on the patty melt. The grilled cheese is good - hits the spot. I have the food palate of a 4 year old and the grilled cheese is delicious and buttery without being soppy and overly greasy. My boyfriend got the steak the first time and was horribly disappointed, but I cannot fault Ritter's for that - he always gets steak at places that proooobably don't specialize in that kind of food. It was oddly overcooked and past well done on one side, but almost rare on the other. Don't really know how they did that. The next time he got a sandwich that had turkey and some other kind of meat and it was good, but now he is totally in love with the patty melt. His apartment is right near Ritter's, which is good and bad (good for the yum and bad for the waistline) and he always wants to come and get a patty melt.   Don't go and expect to get 5-star high quality cuisine. But for what it is - a greasy spoon diner - it is very good."}
{"text":"Where do you go if you've got a major hankering for a good omelet but it's 3am? Where do you go if you have no idea of what you want but  need to have a bunch of yummy options? Some would say E&P but wrong answer. You need a no frills diner that's going to give you what you want and give it to you real good! The answer...Ritter's!  The service and food is consistently good and there's just about something for everyone. I've sampled a bunch of different items like breakfast foods, chili to fried green tomatoes, hot turkey sammy and the steak & cheese sammy, just to name a few. No complaints.   I like the fact that they have the little jukeboxes at the table with a variety of older music to pick from. I just played Gypsy the other night and no one was disturbed by me bobbing my head and attempting to sing along with my girl Stevie.   Lastly, if you're looking for ambience....this ain't the place. If you're looking for a meal that will satisfy at a really good price point with some friendly service by folks who will chat it up with you if you engage them.....then this is your place!  Oh yeah, bring cash, nothing else is accepted."}
{"text":"- Above average food - Below average prices  - Spacious and uncrowded - Free wifi - Cash only"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh classic.  Many, many late nights have I spent here, post strike party, or any other type party, eating the grease necessary to fight off the hangover I deserved the next day.  The waitresses are part of the ambiance.  Love their Reuben."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Only thing I don't like is that the majority of the jukeboxes don't work!"}
{"text":"Ritters has two main perks: 1.) Breakfast 24/7 and 2.) the jukeboxes.   The food is decent diner fare.  A co-worker claimed he had the best steak of his life here and I can no longer trust anything he ever says ever again.  The food is fine, but it's certainly not gourmet nor will it top my grandma's homemade waffles.  But it's cheap and you don't have to bake it yourself.  The service has been overall friendly and reasonably quick.  I've never been here when it was more than half full.  CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"The food is fine and sometimes when the stars align can be considered good.  I usually get an omelet, bacon, and some potatoes.  It seems like most Pittsburghers my age have went here since they were kids.  The food is a solid 2.5 stars, but the nostalgia bumps it up a bit."}
{"text":"Expecting a great brunch meal, myself and two friends visited Ritters on a Saturday. We were seated around 12:15, ordered and the waitress came back to the table twice between 1215 and our food arrival at 130 after sitting with empty glasses and no sign of the waitress for a good half hour. Our food was cold when it came out to top it off. A group of 3 was seated next to us when we got our food, ordered and received their food within 10 minutes and had their checks given the same time ours came out. The place wasn't crowded enough to blame it on being busy, so I'm confused how we were caught with such terrible service and cold food. Told the lady at the counter what happened and she couldn't have cared less. Probably won't be making a trip back for a while"}
{"text":"The first time having American brunch. I ordered Buckwheat pancake served with eggs and sausage. The pancake is really delicious. I love the food?"}
{"text":"Called to ask if there was a wait. As would be first-timer I didn't realize it would be considered a privilege to dine here. The guy who answered the phone asked why I would be bothering to call him."}
{"text":"Traditional diner with red vinyl booths and diner coffee. Very homey and quaint, and you can't beat the price. I enjoyed the omelette with kale and black eyes peas, and the home fries were perfectly crispy on top. I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner  There is plenty of parking on Baum, and the place was crawling with customers on Sunday morning for breakfast."}
{"text":"It's ok at best!! Food not so great, French fries are bitter meaning the geese is OLD.  Soup not hot, waitress and cook fighting loudly.  It across from my hotel but won't be back"}
{"text":"I love this place, especially for a hearty breakfast.  I have several dietary restrictions, and they are always very accommodating.  The food is delicious, and the price is unbeatable."}
{"text":"If you've lived in or around PIttsburgh for more than a year, you should know Ritter's. We've gone there for early morning breakfasts, late night snacks, super late night meals and lunch. All good all the time. A lot of what they serve is homemade. They have a lot of Greek dishes, but you will find mostly diner food. My favorite...the fried chicken!!! The dinners are inexpensive, come with 2 sides and taste great!  They are a cash only establishment, so be mindful of that before you walk in. They do have an ATM there if you forget. The wait staff are really friendly-you can tell they have been there for years. They know everyone!! Check it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE.  The service was not particularly fast....but the waitresses were great.  THIS IS A CASH ONLY PLACE (Just know that in advance, it's posted on the door, but who reads signs...obviously not me...but I did have cash on me so ...wooo hooo).   The food was fantastic.  It's a greasy spoon...PERFECT if that is what you want.  Gyro was yummy....so was the soup and we stayed around for dessert- chocolate cream pie!   I would say that the bathrooms could have used some attention- but this is a dive...so i am more forgiving...I guess...do pee scented bathrooms give food extra taste?"}
{"text":"I will always love this place, mostly because it is one of the few places open 24 hours a day where I can always get a bacon cheeseburger regardless of the hour.  The price is always right, too.   Highly recommended! Cash only but they do have an ATM inside. If you need separate checks be sure to mention it up front, though. Our waitress was a tad rude when we asked her to split the cost at the register because she had already added it up and when she gave us change didn't even give us small bills.  I might have cared more if the food wasn't always so delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dinners.  The food was consistently tasty, and always had a great diner feel to it.  Even on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was never too long for a table.  The wait staff is definitely a bit old, but if you can find a good waitress, you'll get good service.  I recommend the spinach/feta omelet."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you've been doing!  Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries, and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger!  A great place to be drunk in, not so great to be hung over in...  They have your typical greasy spoon fare, so don't go if you're concerned about your health.  Otherwise, eat on brave soul, eat on!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfasts at a reasonable price. I visited my first time because it's a Pittsburgh landmark, but I keep going back because of the great food. The wait staff is always friendly, and I rarely have to wait long for a table. You won't find savory gourmet food here, but you will experience an honestly good traditional diner experience at a good price.  I like that they have free parking available and generous hours. Always a reliably solid choice."}
{"text":"aw more memories!  many a very early morning / late night meal at ritters...   food was always yummy..."}
{"text":"Updating this because it's been a while since I visited & guess what?! Ritter's is still just as good (*surprise surprise... note the sarcasm). Our group of 4 was seated right away on a cold Saturday morning around 11:30 am. I ordered pancakes, egg whites and bacon. I was given a huge portion of three fluffy pancakes, a large portion of eggs & three pieces of bacon. The bacon was actually a little disappointing- it tasted as if they bought the cheapest kind, or maybe it was just a bad batch? Everything else was delicious. I saved one of the pancakes for breakfast the next day & it was just as good. The egg whites were perfect and were super filling. My boyfriend loved his french toast, home fries and sausage. The home fries were delicious. I love that you can listen to music on the jukeboxes while you enjoy a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"Ritters can best be described as classic.  I have been avoiding this place because the last time I was here - it was smoking - and this place was a smokey diner.  But on Sunday we wanted breakfast and it was after 2pm so Ritters was really the only choice.  Glad I returned - much better that I remember.  This is a diner, with diner food and diner prices.  But I still think it deserves 5 starts because it does a great job of just being Ritters.  I could reiterate why it is a classic but the other reviews do a great job of detailing why Ritters is Ritters."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast for the price. The cook even paid attention to my request for LIGHTLY SCRAMBLED eggs. Husband said his breakfast was good and his link sausage was really good.The waitress was prompt and pleasant. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Old school diner experience. Alright food, decent service, super busy sat/sun AM-Noon. classic layout and atmosphere --from the huge eat in bar area to the waitresses wearing nurses outfits."}
{"text":"When the subject of Diners in Pittsburgh comes up, one thinks first of Pamela's. Ritter's came as a recommended alternative and I was pleased to discover it. On a weekday morning, Ritter's was not at all crowded for breakfast. I ordered the two eggs breakfast with scrambled eggs. It came with breakfast potatoes, sausage and rye toast. Service was friendly and quick, with unlimited coffee. All was good and in generous quantity. I must note the link sausage was of a more generous size than often encountered.  The offstreet parking lot is brilliant. The menu is quite reasonably priced. Ritter's accepts cash only. An ATM is on the premises."}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit: don't come here for the food. It is not for those with delicate sensibilities or a snobbish palate.   That said, I love Ritters. Its a Pittsburgh classic (my parents used to eat here) and is pretty much the standard place to go after emerging from an East End dive bar covered in sweat and cigarette smoke, drunk, and seeking some greasy awfulness. The clientele can get belligerent but I think this is all part of the fun. Its a Den of Shame - bask in it, put something on the jukebox, and relax...or don't go here."}
{"text":"i have grown to love thee!!  always spot on ! always a seat ! no wait!  really have been going there a ton as of late and cannot complain.the bill is always under 20 bux for 2 people !"}
{"text":"Just writing this now because it's funny but at the time it wasn't. Went to Ritter's many times because I am from Bloomfield. Once years ago while at breakfast with my sister, I went to put sugar in my coffee and out of the sugar shaker plopped a GIANT dried booger onto the spoon. HA!!!! Ewwwww!"}
{"text":"If I had to give you just one reason to return to this establishment it would be that they have table jukeboxes. Filled with ridiculous music that of course you want to listen to. Fifty cents a play and it only takes quarters. It's easy to have your own little dance party in the booth.  As many have said before, cash only. So if you don't already have your cash or stopped at an ATM, no need to worry there is an ATM right as you walk in.  Not sure if its like this all the time, but it's a seat yourself type of establishment.  When we were there the place wasn't too busy and easy to run for the one server manning the floor.  I love the fact that the server wears scrubs being in close proximity to Shadyside hospital (of course don't expect surgery here).  The place is set up like a classic diner inside with the addition of some late model wood paneling. It's hideous, and I love it. From the booths to the counter seats (where I assume you have to be a regular to sit there). Even the desert case at the register, sadly only filled with minimal treats to take with you.  The bathrooms are typical and scary. I walked into a swimming pool waiting to happen because someone forgot to turn off the water.   The food, hmm the food. What an interesting array of food to have for this place. From grape leaves to meatloaf. Speaking of meatloaf, that's what I had. Two decent size slices of meatloaf, a scoop of diner mashed potatoes, and the gravy on the side. I also opted for the side salad, which was simple with iceberg lettuce, onion, tomato and green pepper. And the fresh (is it really fresh?) bread that they give you is amazing.  If this place is this good at night, I can only imagine what it's like during the day."}
{"text":"Ritters is my favorite diner.  If I get time in the morning, I love to stop for corn beef hash.  They also have a great gyro and sausage and cheese omelette.  Lots of local gossip to be heard.  Jukeboxes on the tables are nostalgic, remind me of \"Happy Days\". Open all hours leads to sightings of interesting characters.  MAC machine inside is convenient and necessary as they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"We were ushered into and got seats pretty quickly. The area is huge compared to my regular go-to place, Pamela's. Our orders were taken shortly after. It took more than 50 minutes for our food to come. That is just unacceptable. If you have a big place, it is your responsibility to hire more people to serve. Granted it was busy but having guests wait for that long is just bad for business. And the food was average and no way made up for the long wait.  I won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and delicious. I walked in on a whim one morning, and they were super busy but the food was AWESOME. I got a gyro meat and feta cheese omelet (loaded) and a side of corned beef hash. My buddy got a Reuben omelet and they were both amazing"}
{"text":"It is definitely an experience. Located in not such a great part of town. Very old. Food is just ok, grease upon grease. Everything came out from the kitchen hot, but looked like it was all cooked in the same grease in the same pan. Waitresses do not make much of an effort. She was more concerned with eating her meal.  Cashier was a breath of fresh air. She was chatty and nice."}
{"text":"my friend and i came around 10:15 one night to grab a bite to eat.  the diner was pretty empty, and we were seated next to a couple who could speak russian spanish and english (\"vanderful!\") this place does serve the typical diner food, and with a decent quality, actaully.  the server (i wish i had gotten her name, but i'm sure she's the main one there) was extremely friendly, saying \"you're welcome\" every time i said \"thank you\", and making sure that our water cups remained full.  when I ordered my burger that ordinarily came with fries, i was telling my friend that i was craving hash browns. so when i ordered a side of hash browns, she kindly offered me to allow me to substitute my fries for their hash browns. it was wonderful!  we looked through their jukebox playlist, and there were quite a few good tunes available, albeit it costs 50 cents a play (i think), which is very very pricey for a jukebox.  our food came out quickly, the receipt was given to us at the table, and we went up to pay. i left a tip at the cashier, who immediately called the waitress over, who took it and said thank you to us. 3.5-4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the wonderfully courteous staff! yes i know that it doesn't add up to 5, but so much the better!"}
{"text":"Cash only and rather unpleasant servers.   The food is decent diner food and the parking is ample.   Don't forget it's cash only."}
{"text":"Come for the drama between the waitresses in nurse scrubs, stay for the food. All the drunk people are an added bonus.   What a great diner. No matter who you are, your name is always \"hon\", and you food is always greasy-tastic. Mmm.  Grease-tastic.   The fact that the owner/manager looks just like Ted Danson's old coach from \"Cheers\" is tremendous."}
{"text":"This place is one of only a couple open in the burgh 24 hours. That's an automatic star in this dead city. They have plenty of food choices (hence the other star), but the food is actually pretty terrible. The only items that are good there are the bacon and toast."}
{"text":"Yeah, no. You'd think this is the diner experience you are looking for and I wouldn't blame you. I thought so too and I thought wrong. Service was lacking, we sat there for like 10 minutes before someone even brought menus. Apparently she 'didn't see us'. Also the entire waiting staff wore nursing/hospital scrubs. wtf? Most importantly, food was just 'MEH'. I don't know how people find the food here worthy of 5 star reviews, I've had better food at random diners in the middle of nowhere in Indiana. Well I wanted to try Ritters and had only myself to blame. My suggestion is take your cash and head to Pamela's. Unless of course it's 3AM and then Ritters it is."}
{"text":"Our server is pleasant. The atmosphere is typical Ritters. Fun and energetic. We (my lovely wife and I) have been waiting for our order for over an hour. If food doesn't come in next few minutes we will have to leave. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The food at Ritter's tastes like I made it at home, and this is not an endorsement.  I had the feta and tomato omelet, and it tasted skunked, like it had just been cooked in a dirty skillet.  It's a dirty diner with meh food, but it is open 24 hours.  If you're drunk, I bet the foood is great."}
{"text":"We waited 40 minutes for our breakfast and when I asked the waitress if it was coming soon, she just said probably not. It was Sunday at 1:00, not particularly busy. Then she gave me the bill for $5 for the coffee. I told the cashier how we didn't even get our breakfast and wasn't happy, she just said you're not the only one. Don't know I'll be back for a while, too many other good breakfast places around."}
{"text":"Finding a good ol' diner in Pittsburgh isn't exactly easy. Pamela's has great breakfast, but is in no sense a diner, and there are many good sandwich shops, but once again, they aren't diners.  Having only been there once so far, my review may be a little skewed. The restaurant has the diner feel, no doubt. There are jukebox machines at every table up front and the decorations harken to the setting of a greasy spoon restaurant.  It was busy when we went, so the food took a while. The wait seemed longer than it should have been, but as I said, the place was packed and it was exactly lunchtime. On the menu it stated that they used \"premium maple syrup\", but I'm pretty sure I just got corn syrup in a cup. The coffee was somewhat watery but still alright.  I ordered the french toast with eggs and bacon, all of which was rather bland (Except the bacon, a meat which has some inherent godliness to it. You can't mess it up). Basically, it seemed like a meal I could have whipped up lazily on my own, and in less time. The bread for the french toast was plain white toast and I normally prefer a better bread. The eggs were eggs: good without any pizzazz.  While Ritters is cheap, from my small sampling, I found the food boring. Most good diners have some excellent menu item, and perhaps I drew the short straw. I might return to Ritters later, but it's certainly not the diner I'm looking for."}
{"text":"Joyce was a great server. She took great care of our party of 7 and was very personable.   Cheap, average diner food. You can have subpar breakfast, lunch or dinner at any time of the day! Best consumed late night when nothing else is open. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here besides a late-night drunk snack."}
{"text":"Ritters is where I go for diner food when I don't want to wait at Pamela's or it's an off-hour time. Standard diner fare but with a Greek twist.  I very much like the stuffed grape leaves and the spinach and feta omelette. I haven't sampled much else on the menu because I'm vegetarian and the dinner options are limited in that regard.  On a different note, I find the diner atmosphere to be a little depressing. The interior could use some cleaning and sprucing up. Additionally, several times I've been there the table has smelled strongly of cleaning product, which is not very appetizing.  I would really like to give it 3.5 stars, but that's not an option."}
{"text":"Cozy little Greek Diner on Baum Boulevard, Ritter's is great even late as they are a 24-hour establishment. The places is bumping on a weekend morning with spotty service but serves an awesome breakfast."}
{"text":"On a postive note, the honey dipped chicken dinner is tasty as well as breakfast.   However, my meatloaf last night was anything but yummy. There was no seasoning in it and I probably tasted one onion in the entire 2 thick slices.   his Greek lasagna was made out of Easy Mac noodles + 1 lasagna noodle on top. It also had a teeny tiny bit of sauce. I'm not sure what was Greek about it. The rolls were rock hard too.   I'll come back when Im drunk and hungry for a greasy 3am breakfast or a burger or appetizers since yelpers seemed to say good things about those.   Also they changed their hours are are no longer always 24 hours. Sunday, Monday & Tuesdays they close at ten."}
{"text":"Great place to go at 3 am when your hammered and just want some food. Ritters only takes cash and the service can be extremely terrible sometimes. However, they are open 24 hours and will serve you breakfast. I think they've seen enough of their share of drunken idiots like us that they're used to it by now. Oh. Did I mention that they are open 24 hours. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Ritter's might be one of the only true, old school diners left in Pittsburgh. And I absolutely adore it. I get the impression that most of the waitresses at Ritters have been employees for multiple decades, as well as most of the cooks. The food is classic hearty diner fare, the prices are low, and the ambiance is everything you could ask for, plus it's open 24 hours a day. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I stopped into Ritter's for breakfast this past Sat. morning at 11am.  Despite living two blocks away and having driven by many times, I'd never dropped in until now.  Given that I needed an inexpensive and convenient place to meet someone who also lives nearby, I figured it was as good of an opportunity as any to try it out, so I suggested it and we met for Sat. breakfast.  Fortunately, my friend arrived 15 min. before I did and was able to secure a table, since Ritter's gets quite crowded on Sat. mornings.  Also fortunately, the interior is quite large, which is necessary given its popularity at peak hours.  Once I was seated, our server promptly took our orders, which was appreciated.  However, it took almost half an hour for the kitchen to get them out, which seemed long, given the amount of time that my friend had already waited, and that I've received prompter order fulfillment at other diners, such as the Dor Stop.  Once it finally emerged, the food itself was pretty standard quality diner food--nothing to write home about.  Given that it was Halloween morning, I ordered the pumpkin pancake special ($5.99) with a side of bacon ($2.50).  I could definitely detect pumpkin in the pancake batter, which was nice, but I've been spoiled by the Dor Stop's pumpkin pancakes (which are available year round, BTW), and these didn't hold a candle to them.  The bacon was also disappointingly chewy, to the point that I didn't even finish part of my last strip.  My friend ordered the chicken sandwich, which seemed of similar mediocre quality, though I didn't try it.  Overall, Ritter's met my standards for diner food, but didn't exceed them, and failed to meet them in some respects (chewy bacon--argh!).  One thing Ritter's has going for it is that the prices are quite reasonable; however, come prepared as only cash is accepted.  I realize that a lot of their business comes from inebriated customers late at night, so if that describes your situation, it probably hits the spot.  If you're willing to travel and are looking for a good weekend morning breakfast, though, I recommend the Dor Stop in Dormont or Central Diner and Grill in Robinson, both of which illustrate that diner food can be better than mediocre--in fact, it can be great!"}
{"text":"Any establishment that's open 24 hours gets bonus points in my book.  It's my firm opinion that any business that serves customers on a walk-in basis should be open 24/7.  I mean, yeah, there's that circadian rhythm thing that keeps every business from having the graveyard shift, but I'm sure we're only a couple decades away from curing the need for sleep.  Point is, Ritter's is 24 hours, and as a result it's been a standby ever since I moved into town.  The food at Ritter's is definitely better than what you'll get at a Denny's or a King's.  It isn't top-shelf, artisan food, but it is pretty good diner food.  Ritter's is also a great place to go hang out with a few friends late at night, and BS over coffee when you're just not feeling going to a bar and blowing mad cash on drinks.  Or for stopping by after you've already blown your mad drink cash.  The waitresses are nice.  The fellah who usually rings us out was really rude to me at least once.  I think he was the owner or manager or something, too.  But I'm not really sure.  The place is cash-only, too, which sucks.  However, the fact that they're cash-only leads to a really encouraging story about the place: one time the ATM did something wacky and I thought I may have been charged without having received my cash.  The waitress took down my name and phone number, which I thought was just to get me to stop complaining, but sure enough someone called me the next day and gave me the run-down on what had happened.  I'd call that good service.  If it's late and you're peckish, don't forget that Ritter's is open."}
{"text":"Ritters I'm giving you a three. The food is just ok food. Its not going to knock your socks off but its better than fast food. Cramped busy diner atmosphere.  Parking is rough. Great people watching."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting... From the food... To the floor .. To the girl waiting on us. If I could give this a zero with a complimentary sick bag I would. Completely atrocious... And bring cash... Its cash only... But they won't tell you until you get your check... While they're eating like pigs in a troft in the booth next to you. I recommend a hospital cafeteria over this dump..."}
{"text":"I mean come on. This is how it's supposed to be done. This diner is everything it should be and nothing it shouldn't. Is the food the best in the city, no. But it's not trying to be. It's delicious though and done just the way you expect. People know each other's names. The atmosphere is second to none. It's all family. Feels like home and I've only been to Pittsburgh 4 times in my life."}
{"text":"Visited around 9 PM on a recent Tuesday evening.  Greeted/seated immediately.  We used to live 1/2 block away and have eaten at Ritter's for over 40 years. Not having been there for a couple of years, I had my choices already in mind.  Not disappointed: new menus; same Ritter's specialties. My wife and I ordered our favorites. Good service. Good food. Clean restaurant.   Not fancy. Not supposed to be. There are so many times we want to get away from over-hyped, over-prepared menus and just eat some good, hot food.  Ritter's is the place. Been there forever!"}
{"text":"Oh, Ritters. I'd actually give this place a 3.5. The food is nothing special...just basic, greasy, diner food. The rating is not for the food, or for what the places looks like or feels like. This rating is for what Ritter's REPRESENTS. Ritters represents late nights after the bar with friends. Ritters represents the meal that will soak up the alcohol and save you from a wicked hangover. Ritters represents 3AM with your friends, not because anyone is particularly hungry for chicken tenders, but because the bars are closed and no one is ready to go home quite yet. The laughter and fun shared at late night at Ritters can be replaced by nothing else. If you are looking for awesome food, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for standard, 24 hour diner food and an awesome place to people watch once the bar doors close, this is your place. It is so awesome to see all of the club goers pile into Ritters after dancing on a dark dance floor....hair a mess, mascara looking more like a raccoon than the model they were just a few hours ago and limping in those fierce heels they thought looked SO cute when they hit the dance floor. This place is an institution among those who spend their early/mid twenties in the Oakland/Shadyside/Bloomfield area. If you haven't spent a late night at Ritters, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Ritters is a Pittsburgh treasure. Old school diner, complete with at-table mini jukeboxes that sometimes work. Great people watching here.  This is the place you come for late night munchies or possibly morning after recovery.  Breakfast food is on point, as is the Greek fare. Cash only like most of the coolest spots in The Burgh!"}
{"text":"They don't take credit cards (cash only), but damn do they have some good food! The server we had was funny as hell. It's just a good old fashioned diner that's open 24/7/365, and you can have whatever's on their menu 24/7/365! lol.  Early one recent morning (still getting caught up on reviews!), I had their fried chicken, and it was excellent. Moist and flaky. I loved the Strawberry Shortcake too. The portions are huge! We didnt find the place to be dirty when we came. They have their own free parking lot and have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"I literally just got robbed by the fucking cock. By cock I meant cook but there isn't spell check on yelp and it's funny so anyhow. I was using their shitty tabletop jukeboxes that are always wonky but kitchy enough to keep trying anyhow cuz sometimes you get lucky and Springsteen knows the words you need at 3:30am on Easter Sunday when your mom doesn't even wanna hang out. The quarter got stuck per ushe and I hit it. KA-CHING!!!! Out came like 9 quarters!!! Nine! But then the cook came over and made me give them to him. Atleast I told him that 75 cents was mine so atleast I'm leaving up but dang that's fucked up and while I will always love this place I will never forget the night I got robbed by the cock at ritters. I didn't misspell it that time!!!!"}
{"text":"This is like being in a movie about a diner minus the fake quality. Awesome people watching. I recommend the fried green tomatoes and the hot brown. These might be okay in the light of day. Other things, not so much."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite diner in Pittsburgh. I had the ham breakfast and it was so tender it almost melted in my mouth. And if you sit at the bar you might get to chat with Hosea, (if you're lucky!)."}
{"text":"Ritter's will never be a fine dining establishment. It will always be a diner. It will always be a standby. It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.  Everyone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry. Every now and then, I do allow myself to order a slice of the freshly made banana cream pie. Wow...it is tasty."}
{"text":"Never come for a Saturday brunch. We waited for 80 min still got no food. It is not a fancy place why should we spend so long just for a 5 min pancakes? Feel sad for my first and last visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 eggs and potatoes which was only $3.85...DEAL!  I asked for the eggs to be scrambled and it came with home fries and toast.  I know my meal wasn't that exciting and can you really mess up eggs, toast or potatoes?!?!  The eggs and toast were fine - something I could've made at home.  But the home fries left something to be desired.  They had no flavor - it's like someone boiled some potatoes and slapped them in a pan and served them on a plate.  I put some salt and pepper on them, but it didn't really help - it's like the potatoes were determined to be tasteless.  I ate a few forkfuls and just gave up.    I came here for a meeting in the morning and it wasn't crowded.  Looked like there were some regulars but fairly low key.  I could definitely see how peeps who come here after a night of being out.    I'm not sure that I'd make it a point to go to Ritters unless it was a night out and I needed a place open 24 hours.  They are CASH only!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a blast from the past! The setting brings you back to an old school diner. I am not a fan of the food. The food was just okay. I got chicken fingers, and my girlfriend bought some chicken entree. Both meals looked like they were just microwaved. The staff was great though! It is important to know they are a cash only restaurant. While this is not my favorite restaurant, I would recommend if your looking for an old fashioned American meal."}
{"text":"Oh, local greasy spoon... I'm so torn on how to write this review. If I were reviewing you on the atmosphere alone you would definitely get a big hefty 5 stars. The people watching is second to none and at any time of day since you're open 24/7. The staff is probably a 3 as I've had less than stellar service here on more than one occasion.  The food. Hmmm. Well, it's dinner food. The breakfast is right on par with what one would expect from a diner like this. It's far from good for you and generally sits in your gut like a cinder block. It's not BAD by any means though. Also you only take cash and have one of the shadiest ATM machines I've ever seen...  I'm going to go with a middle ground, dear Ritter's Diner, and give you a 4 stars. You're local, you're not a disgusting chain restaurant, and you've always been pretty good to me."}
{"text":"This is an institution.  I hit the counter with a 15 minutes window - ordered two eggs over, hash browns and dry rye- 5 min later- bingo and the hot sauce was waiting.  I llike the Greek items- the cheap prices and the open 24 hours- the cranky servers are the best and worst of Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"An iconic Pittsburgh diner. Maintaining its customer base on its laurels. Breakfast is ok, coffee a bit on the weak side and bathrooms could be a little cleaner. Still one of the places to experience in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Even though it is close to some hotels, this establishment seems to cater mostly to the locals, which usually means good value. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. The cod was especially fresh. Friendly waiting staff."}
{"text":"After many years of going past this place, I finally had the chance to go in and check out the food! As soon as you enter Ritter's Diner, right there in front of you is an ATM- credit/debit cards are not accepted. The décor is not modern, but it still adds to the diner's charm. The waitresses, who wear hospital scrubs as their uniforms, were friendly, but they seemed rather tired while I was there. Nonetheless, my waitress was attentive and provided efficient service. Ritter's Diner is open 24/7 and whatever is on the menu can be ordered any time of day. So for brunch, I ordered a steak breakfast that came with eggs, home fries and toast. Everything was delicious! I am so pleased with my first experience at Ritters Dinner that I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"The food was good, slightly above average. I Ordered the steak and eggs and pancakes. The pancakes were slightly below I hop quality. I think they offer vegan and vegetarian food as well. Service was adequate but not over the top. I'd go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Must be OK, I went twice :D it's a pretty standard diner and the food was good.  Visited for lunch and breakfast, They do a good business so you might wait for a table depending on the time of day.   Burgers were very good, Reuben and meat loaf sandwich were OK.   Breakfast was good but to be honest I've never been at a diner with bad breakfast.  If I find one I'll be sure to roast it on yelp!  If your right next to it and hungry stop and dine."}
{"text":"This is a nice dive diner, great if you need food in the middle the night. It definitely has a kitschy old-school ambiance, perfect for the hipster set Or the actual, old-school set.  The side salad that came before the entree was regrettable and superfluous, though I wasn't expecting much in the first place. It was definitely pre-mixed long before we arrived, which wouldn't have been bad except they also mix in the croutons, were become gross and soggy after sitting in a bowl of salad.  My fried chicken was excellent. Perfectly crisp with a great batter, and not too salty. I had home fries on the side which were well cooked but very much under-seasoned.   The service was rather basic and inattentive, but you can't expect much more from a place like this. All in all we enjoyed our visit and we'll be back when we need some late night comfort food."}
{"text":"Sometimes at four in the morning you need a place to eat, and, for that purpose, Ritters does its job. Otherwise the food is pretty mediocre. Remember if you can after a long night out that this establishment is cash only.   You are never going to get great service here, and for the most part at night when the entire place is packed full of belligerent drunks why should you? The waitstaff does their job: takes orders, brings out the food, and refills your drinks, but don't expect much more and surely don't expect to have all your requests pampered. I feel bad for the waitstaff who have to deal with drunks all night, especially on the weekend.  This is a Pittsburgh landmark, nice diner vibe, and a place where I will always have great memories. Though the food is pretty mediocre and slightly overpriced for the quality I will always keep coming back here out of nostalgia."}
{"text":"Classic diner. Great cheap options. Definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"So after the encouragement of many of my friends I decided to gave this place another try.   We had the fried zucchini, spanakopita, and their fish sandwich.  I was prepared to be disappointed by the food again but I instead I had to kick myself on that last review.   It was still diner food, but as far as diner food goes, it was impressive. I didn't even know diners served this vast variety of food.  I am a huge fan of breakfast food, because besides it being the most important meal of the day, I love the doughy goodness and comfort of pancakes and waffles. This time I was dissuaded from ordering my usual and instead opted for some proper dinner food.   The spanakopita was a bit soggy but otherwise the meal was above satisfactory. I had my first experience of fried zucchini and now I know what the fuss is all about! They're a delicious alternative to the classic potato fries and I delight to try them again.  While many people are unfavorably disposed to fish,  I love it. I think it's an acquired taste, but their fish was perfectly crispy and the tartar sauce wasn't half bad either! I would definitely go to this place again for a late night meal.   Also their mini jukeboxes are incredibly cute so if you're feeling extremely nostalgic of the '40's then I'd go here."}
{"text":"Ritter's is definitely one of the best diners in Pittsburgh. The bacon is on point, chili is good, fried green tomatoes is bomb, and my personal favorite is the honey-dipped fried chicken, which is the best I've had in this whole city. At one time, they were open 24/7, but this is sadly no longer the case. Their pies and milkshakes are worth trying too."}
{"text":"Wanted pancakes with a side of sausage patties and scrambled eggs. Pancakes came out ok. a bite of the eggs and sausages and they were both dry like they'd been in an oven for a while after being cooked. the waitress was a bit intimidating and I told her that things were dry. things felt awkward. She put in an order for scrambled eggs that were more softly scrambled. The bus boy who came to give me the new eggs showed up with sausages and made comments about how I didn't know what I was talking about. I'm the one stuck with eating the food buddy... if i don't want to eat them because they taste too dry, then they're too dry.  The waitress put the sausages on a plate to be sent back (to the next customer I assume). they over corrected the eggs and were way too runny.   I'm stuck cause there aren't many diners near Oakland open at 7am."}
{"text":"It's a diner. It's what you would expect from a diner: Decent food, friendly service, and reasonable prices. They keep the coffee coming, and your food is hot when you get it. I mean, really, what more do you want?"}
{"text":"The only real downside was the fact that we had to pay in cash and there was an ATM that charged me $$ to withdraw said cash.   Besides that annoyance my experience here was pleasant. It's a nice place to go to for some late night food without it being too hectic.    I've been here twice and I've ordered the same thing both times - the omelette with shredded lamb in it. I don't remember what it's called but I thought it was pretty well made and was tasty."}
{"text":"Conveniently across the street from UPMC Shadyside hospital.    Great service and down home atmosphere is hard to beat. Had the liver and onions which came with choice of potatoes, veggies, and a hard roll. Normal person portions and with a coffee came to less than ten bucks.   Food wasn't anything to right home about, but a nice experience, convenient location, and open 24 hours.   Cash only, but there is an ATM machine."}
{"text":"Iconic diner so I've been told and the proof for me today was the fact that the parking lot was packed and there were at least 10 of us standing outside in line waiting IN THE RAIN for our turn at breakfast!  That says something either about the diner or about us (nevermind).  The line went fast and we had friendly and efficient service from our server, typical diner fare and what I expected.  It filled my stomach and I was happy.  I ordered french toast, bacon and orange juice -- nothing fancy.  Note that they do not take credit cards."}
{"text":"I remember my first experience at a diner: Art Deco-inspired architecture, narrow and long floorplan, jukeboxes, neon signs, quick service, and extremely tasty pancakes with chocolate syrup! Granted I was only 7 or 8 years old then, but I can recall everything (how can I forget the taste of those pancakes?!). Since then, I've been to quite a few diners, including diner-restaurants (i.e. faux diners). I would go particularly on the morning after a night of partying and/or drinking, when I'm feeling too lazy or hung over to cook something decent without burning myself and my kitchen. On these mornings, I would typically order pancakes or omelettes with a side (usually hash browns) and coffee. Honestly, I've never eaten anything other than these breakfast staples at a diner.  My friends and I arranged to have a late brunch one day at Ritters Diner. Now, I didn't have much to eat the night before, so I couldn't wait until we met to have something to eat. So, I came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast. A quick observation of the diner made me realize that this isn't a traditional diner; instead, it seemed more like a diner-restaurant. Oh well, there was still the service and the food to worry about. We sat down at a booth in the large room in the back of the restaurant. The waitress greeted us and took our drink orders immediately: two cups of coffee and two glasses of water. Several minutes later, we got our coffee and water, but weren't ready to order just yet. We spent several more minutes deciding, and when we were ready, we placed our menus in a neat stack in the center of the table to show that we were ready to order. We waited...and waited...and waited some more. Minutes turned into half an hour and longer. By that point, my friends were getting quite hangry. I was sitting there feeling sorry for them and very concerned with the poor service. This whole time, I was monitoring discreetly the other diners who had our waitress and arrived after we did. A few of them actually have gotten their food, have paid, and have left. After what seemed like an eternity, our waitress suddenly materializes and takes our order.  We get our food: chocolate chip pancakes; club sandwich; spinach omelette with cheese and buttered toast; and something else (sorry, I must've had too much coffee). My omelette was decent; I would have preferred if they hadn't used too much cheese, especially what I think was American cheese (it could've been cheddar, but the taste didn't seem right). The toast was good, but I was too full to keep eating. I did try a bite of the chocolate chip pancakes, and it was so rich and delicious! My other two starving friends pretty much inhaled their food in minutes.  Based on this one experience, I would come only for the pancakes. Service was really bad even though the place was half empty. I might experiment with this diner once or twice more to get a better feel for it.  So to summarize: not a real diner, service was bad, food was decent, and come for the pancakes."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ritter's since the 70's. It's an awesome place and the food is the best. Try the holubki aka pigs in the blanket on wednesdays. They are very good. The servers are always spot on. The food is always good. Love it."}
{"text":"Titters is the best diner in Pittsburgh.  Their home fries and basically of their late breakfast menu items are great.  Because of this, I've never tried any of the rest of the menu.  Bring quarters if you feel like setting your iPhone down for a minute to listen to an old school, \"flip menu\" jukebox.  Just don't play any Survivor if there is a couple breaking up in the booth next to you."}
{"text":"I was visiting a church in the area and decided to try this diner. It had mixed reviews so my curiosity got the best of me.  The menu is lengthy. I am a huge breakfast food fan so I decided to order breakfast. I usually go the eggs and bacon route, but flipped the script when I saw the Coco Loco pancakes. They are pancakes with chocolate chips and coconut. I also ordered a side of bacon. My son got bacon & eggs that came with toast and home fries.  When my pancakes came they looked like your typical pancakes with a light sprinkling of coconut and chocolate chips. There was also a drizzle of chocolate syrup. I was a tad disappointed. I ate the top pancake and it was incredibly delicious. I thought \" it's too bad this is not in each pancake. Still hungry I started eating the two remaining pancakes. Oh. My. Word. There wasn't any coconut in them but they were packed with chocolate chips. I'm talking packed!  They were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The side of bacon was a little salty which was needed to break up all of the sweetness of the pancakes. My son eats \"dippy\" eggs ( runny sunny side up). I'm not a fan but he enjoyed them. Living in the Burgh we are used to getting Italian bread as toast but this was true blue white sandwich bread. He cleaned his plate so that should tell you that he liked it a lot.  The diner is exactly that-a true diner. It has never been updated. The menu has probably been the same for more than 25 years. But if your parking lots (they have 2) are filled that means you are doing something right. The cars were everything from old beaters to Porches. That says a lot as well.  We will definitely be back to try other menu items!!"}
{"text":"Ritters is open 24 hours, accepts cash only, and the offerings are what you'd expect. I appreciate that kind of consistency. They always have avgolemono soup, which I also appreciate. Having said that, it's not great tasting, but it's solidly not bad, and the waitstaff are very nice, especially when I'm tired and trying to order at 3am. Don't come expecting a gourmet experience, but you will definitely get an old fashioned, non gentrified, solid diner meal here, and I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service, nostalgia: what more could you ask for?   My dad brought me to Ritter's many times when I was a kid, before we moved out of the city. Now that I'm commuting to Pitt, I'm back. Before even talking about the food, I'd like to say how nice the staff is. They're always in a good mood, and they know their stuff. In the three years that I've been going there I don't think that they've ever let my coffee cup go empty.   Breakfast is excellent, no matter what time of day you have it. I especially love their homefries, which are nice and crispy but not overdone. This may seem like a minor thing, but you'd be surprised how many restaurants can mess up a fried potato. If you're coming in for lunch I would strongly suggest one of their salads; the lettuce is fresh and crisp and so are the toppings. If you get a steak salad, the steak comes right off of the grill and onto your plate, along with the fries. The soups are also delicious, although the Greek Lemon Soup is a bit sweet. I love their Navy Bean and Beef Barley soups, can't get enough of them. For lunch or dinner they have good comfort food: meatloaf with mushroom gravy, pork chops and kraut, stuffed cabbage, etc. Some days they make a homemade Greek pastitsio (did I spell that right?), which I think is even better than what is served at the Greek Food Festival in Oakland.   One last thing that I'd like to say is that they know how to make eggs over-easy. I like my fried eggs very runny or dippy or however you say it, and Ritter's makes them just so. A lot of breakfast places that I've been to tend to give you over-medium when you ask for over-easy. Just another indication that the cooks know their stuff."}
{"text":"Ritter's has been on my list for a long time and finally i was in the area at breakfast time.  It is a very cozy diner bustling with activity and a cacophony of plates, flatware, and coffee cups clanging about.  I had French toast and two over easy eggs and while very basic they hit the spot without over stuffing me.  We had a treat this morning in that the mayor, county exec, and the Boston mayor were here for breakfast - along with TV news crews from kdka and wpxi."}
{"text":"Ritters is an institution of a sort in the east end. For me, I like breakfast here but not much else. I love greasy diner breakfasts like Pamela's or, for those of you who have experienced it, the Venus diner; it's out of this world! (ha ha! I kill me)  I feel like Ritter's is one of those love it or hate it kind of places. Love it or not, there are some things that make this place really unique....the waitresses all wear scrubs, like nursing scrubs...which I find ironic because sometimes after clogging my arteries with my three meat omelet I feel like I need medical assistance. The coffee, I swear on my life it's that chicory crap that southerners love. It def has a....distinct...taste. The atmosphere is decidedly grubby-chic, but in a good way. They clearly have not put a dime into the place, but it works somehow.  They, like Pamela's, only take cash, but there is a little ATM in the foyer.   Like I said, the breakfast is greasy and delicious, as it should be. Of all the other things I've had there, the burgers are kinda icky, like frozen semi-meat rounds. The specials, ie stuffed cabbage, tuna casserole, meat loaf, usually need salt or some other flavor factor. You will notice a Greek theme, because the family is Greek. They have a few different Greek foods like Gyros and grape leaves and things. I've had the gyro and it's not bad, but if you go and they have the lemon chicken soup on special, GET IT! I loved it. Never would have thought it, but I did.  I've never had a problem with the staff. Some are more talkative than others but they are all pretty nice and accommodating.  Oh, and they are pretty good on pies too!!"}
{"text":"Alright, I love this place. I lived in the area for a while and started to come here every morning. I even started to become a regular, and the staff memorized my usual order.  It felt like home, and the food was great, especially for the completely reasonable prices. Regarding the cash-only rule, it actually grew on me and I've come to appreciate it."}
{"text":"Classic diner. Great breakfast menu. Great service. I will be back when doing business in the area."}
{"text":"It's hard not to give this place and extra star just for sentiment. Honestly Ritters is a favorite of mine. I love diner food. If you're looking for a late night, drunken fourth meal, this is your place. If you just want a no frills, greasy spoon, Saturday brunch, Ritters is there for you.  This place is blocks from where I live which makes it even better for me, and it is open 24 hours! One of the only places in town, or at least on the East End that holds that title. Perfect for those of us that frequent Bloomfield, Shadyside and Lawrenceville for late night fun. I can't tell you how many times in group of friends looking to satisfy their drunk munchies (or otherwise) in the wee hours that RITTERS!! is shouted. It's there, it's open and ready to serve you anything from it's extensive menu of diner food.   It's also good anytime, to go in and watch the old yinzers on a Saturday morning, drink their coffee, read the paper and just being so Pittsburgh. Served by waitresses in their nurse scrubs that always call you 'hun.'  The food - I have never had a problem with the food. I love breakfast and I don't think I have gotten anything else here. I think maybe my sunnyside eggs were undercooked once - but that has happened to me at really nice restaurants too, and eggs just seem to be something that is done wrong fairly often. I think their hotcakes are pretty darn good and that is my go-to meal. A great hangover cure, always."}
{"text":"Do you need a place to soak up the alcohol after a long night of drinking?  Do you like being served by a grizzled waitress in a nurse's top who has smoked a pack a day since she was 12?  Do you enjoy old school diners and mediocre food at low prices?  If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, Ritters is the place for you!    The PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I have eaten there a few times, but those times were really out of desperation because nothing else was open.  Given all the food selections in the area, I can safely say that Ritter's isn't the #1 choice for most people, but it fits the bill when you need something hot to eat.  I'm sure the PIC and I will find ourselves back there before too long."}
{"text":"Not bad not bad at all, went on a late sunday morning and it seemed it would be too busy to get us in and out fast. Just as we were walking out the door an older gentlemen ushered us in and right to a seat. The cash only sign almost scared us off.   Anyway food is typical diner food I had a bacon egg and cheese bagel sandwich and it was fine for the price 5.85 with home fries. Waitresses were very attenative with coffee and water refills and brought us our food quickly. You can't always get nice service in busy places so that was a big plus.   I can tell this has been Pittsburgh oldie for a while, its not a new age vegan vegetarian friendly joint. although several vegetarian options (with egg) on the omelette portion of breakfast menu. Also several greek american type salads and dishes (gyros) if you're into that.   If you're looking for a cheap greasy nostalgia this is it, if you're seeking a spectacular garlic potato, red roasted peper and asiago cheese omelette you're not gonna find it here. I liked the people owner and wait staff and food is decent so I gave it four. Sometimes you have to know what you came for and just be happy with that :)"}
{"text":"I love Shirley.... I love the diner atmosphere & I loved the diner home cooked farm fresh food!  I felt like I was on Route 66.  Absolutely excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Morning RANT; Took myself out to breakfast at Ritter's Diner this morning. Had to listen to Little John ( a chef & owner) belittle, berate, yell & swear at the waiters!! I couldn't even finish my breakfast! The more he yelled the madder I got. I got up to talk to one of the original owners about what I had been listening too and he did not seem surprised at all... He took my check away so I didn't have to pay BUT that was not my point... He seemed embarrassed but, after he walked away, I watched to see if he would confirm Mr Little John but to my disappointed, he did not... Waiters & servers are extremely hard workers, they endure so much from the kitchen, the customers, they are on their feet ALL day long taking care of the whole restaurant and getting paid very little so they depending on their tips to make a living & still greet you with a smile! They deserve & should demand more respect from their employers!! I am so mad about this, this is not the end of the story.... I will be back to confront him personally but, to respect the waiters, I will wait for a less busy time. I gave my gal a larger than usual tip and told her that they should strike & make Little John be the waiter for a day!!!! I know they are afraid of loosing their jobs & probably won't stand up, they need someone who will stand up for them! Ask my husband, Little John is in for a big old can of whoop ASS!!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Ritters this afternoon with family for lunch. I've been there a number of times, and recognize it has its niche as a Pgh institution...but wow...service, people. The service today sat so far below the threshold for quirky, distinctive personality or anything...it was simply dismal. The waitress was absent mostly, served an outdated milk to my grandson, we had to wait forever for drinks or refills, our food...and the food was passably okay, at best. Ritters may be a Pgh institution, but this is the sort of experience that leads to \"darn shame what happened\", \"used to be great\" and \"we don't go there anymore\"."}
{"text":"When you think of a diner, Ritter's is it.  My favorite is the steak n' eggs, but I also like the club sandwich & many other offerings.  We used to be regulars years ago when we were in the area more often, but now it's a special occasion kind of a stop.  Classic diner feel, great owners, gruff but sweet waitresses, etc.  Check it out?"}
{"text":"I can't really give a food review since I didn't order anything, but there is a reason why I didn't order anything.  My brother and his friends had the midnight munchies after the whole pub crawling. Being the responsible little sister, I \"chaperoned\" the boys and went the Ritters with them. I wasn't in the mood to eat after midnight, but that's not the reason why I didn't order anything. The reason why I didn't get anything was because when we walked in the diner, I looked at the variety of dishes other patrons ordered and felt slightly sick to my stomach. Must've been my inner conscious that the food is bad news and I guessed correctly. My brother had the Arcadian burger and by sunrise, his stomach didn't settle well. Had no desire to eat throughout the day.  Trust your eyes, nose, and instinct. It's most likely right."}
{"text":"In case you don't know - cash only.   The burgers are well done only. Not my preference but what the heck, when in a local institution you don't debate tradition. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this is going to be like eating a brick or tasteless. Absolutely not. It was a really good tasting chargrilled burger.    Staff is great.  Just what you expect from a diner:  helpful, pleasant, fast and natter-of-fact.  I would definitely go back if I'm ever in Pittsburgh again because there are a lot of things on the menu to try. I saw a waffle with strawberries that looked delish."}
{"text":"Note #1: Lemme hear a big CASH ONLY! An ATM can be found inside for your convenience.   Note #2: Ritters is a 24/7/365 restaurant that offers its entire menu from breakfast to lunch to dinner all day and all night every single day. And man, did we have a blast with this! Keep readin', pilgrim...  I am not a lush of any kind, and this past Friday morning, I unsuspectingly fell madly in love with Ritters Diner.   We had thought of going to Ritters during the graveyard shift one weekend, but being that the establishment reportedly attracts Pittsburgh's young, intoxicated, and obnoxious during that time and that I have little patience for such humanoids, that plan was nixed. However, on a frosted, lightless payday Friday morn, Kay was waiting on a background check before she could start her new job, and I needed sustenance before work. When we both awoke earlier than expected, Ritters immediately came to mind, and suddenly, it was Bloomfield or bust!  I enjoy a wholesome, solid, mountain-man breakfast sans bells, whistles, and rainbow jimmies as much as any other blue-collar bloke, but when burgers and fried chicken can be had at 6:30 AM, omelets and pancakes become too drab and obvious. Besides, I'm also an Aquarian, and when put into boxes, we tend to think our way out of 'em.  And the Pittsburgh City Paper said that Sousa's main gentrification vehicle Salt of the Earth \"blurs distinctions.\" Heh.   Enter the beast known as The Pitts-burger. Centered 'round a thick, bleeding medium-rare patty, this Goliath of ground beef included BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon, and a fried egg. One of THE essential burgers encountered during my dining lifetime, it dripped, oozed, kissed, stung, and occupied that roaring void in my stomach like few have. The bun was toasted and was not without a hint of butter. The Pitts-burger may strangle your heart, but it will do it so, so softly.   The french fries were burning majestic scepters of yellow, mashed potato chip glory.  Kay's fried chicken smacked of honey, crackling when our teeth punctured the  homemade batter to reveal sultry poultry inside. Our lovingly irreverent and streetwise server told us that Ritters sells more clucker parts than the nearby KFC does, and I want to believe her. The Colonel's mass-produced swill deserves to be outclassed.   Our desserts were Chocolate Cream Pie and Strawberry Shortcake. The Chocolate Cream Pie should be renamed the Chocolate Dream Pie for its velvety, otherworldly pudding filling, it's flagrantly flaky crust, and its sweetness-cutting whipped cream garnish. The Strawberry Shortcake was akin to slices of golden shortbread mortared together by preserves and topped with a gilded white buttercream.   To us, there was nothing dingy about Ritters. Jukeboxes lined the perimeter of the dining room and abstract sculptures of labyrinthine iron jutted from sides of the booths. Burly, middle-aged men in work clothes patronized the diner instead of immature partygoers. Some are making Ritters out to be a \"last chance\" sort of place that they seem to want to like less than they do, giving out backhanded kudos to it as if it were a dirty old strip club that amused them and nothing more. When I looked around Ritters and relished its classic, economical cuisine, I saw, tasted, and felt nothing but timelessness, integrity, and an affectionate mindfulness of quality.    I don't know how many years Ritters Diner has been in operation, but I do know that I'd hate to see it uprooted by renewal and replaced with something that is exploitative of indigenous food such as Thai fusion or whatever else the privileged have co-opted this week.  Forgo the East End's glitter and skitter o'er to Ritters for some food that will leave ya the opposite of...bitter."}
{"text":"Was here with my mom a while back and we fell in love. The coconut pancakes were killer. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Late nite meal. Gyro was a bit dry. Coleslaw and fries were great.  Rice pudding was great."}
{"text":"UPDATE - I went back for dinner to give them a fair shake....well my first clue was sticking to the table. Stains were present from other diners...no biggie...I will ask to have the table wiped down. While I listened to the waitress arguing with another old timer over the price of a roll (who manages this and let's this stuff go on?), I decided to check the silverware. Yep...leftover food particles. I have a healthy immune system I think....well then my sprite came in a clear glass. The white milk like stain on the inside of the drink was slowly flaking off into my ice....last straw...I told the waitress and walked out. FILTHY MCNASTY!  My morning review is below:   Walked over from UPMC to have breakfast. Typical diner look and menu. I really don't get the hype as the food was average at best. The server was nice and attentive thus the third star. One thing that bothered me was one old man who just got up got behind the counter and helped himself to drinks. Clearly a customer and not an owner. I may try something else but really underwhelming concerning the hype."}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for dinner the other night. I had the Baked cod with french fries and a house salad. The place is pretty big and has plenty of seating. The waitress was very friendly and service was excellent. The cod was really good and the salad as well was good. The prices were good and overall I was extremely happy with Ritters. The only negative aspect was that they only took cash which wife and I did not know in advance, Luckily we had some with us. *****cash only establishment**** There is however a ATM by the front entrance. i definitely would recommend Ritters Diner and you can be sure I will be going there again."}
{"text":"Best brunch ever!  You will have better luck getting seated quickly if you arrive by 10am.  They have the best potatoes in the burgh and it's good food that will stick to your ribs!  The service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Old fashioned diner that could use more upkeep. Decent food for the price though! Wish they took credit cards.."}
{"text":"Something about this place.... I don't know what it is. The food is really only 3-star at times, and yet if you come in here starved, it can taste as good as 4 stars or hell even 5. Maybe 5 if your stoned, actually.  ;)  It might be because my dad used to take me here after church when I was a kid, so I feel really nostalgic about the place. Ironically, I am pretty sure I hated it as a kid. I love their buckwheat pancakes now though. Truly a PA tradition for me. And my BF enjoyed their French toast.  Sat at the bar to be served right away. Scrubs-clad waitstaff was friendly and prompt.   They only take cash *gasp* but luckily for me (a.) there's an ATM in the front of the place, and (b.) my credit union will refund my ATM fees every month. So yeah, not a big deal.  Parking was kinda tight but they do have an overflow lot, kinda behind the place a bit.   Legit comfort food at a greasy spoon diner that's been around for ages. Gotta love it."}
{"text":"I've only been here after 2 AM, and it's always been a flaming trainwreck of an experience.  I've had to figure out if the waitresses were doing this as a halfway house job, I've had staff members not apologize while picking pieces of steel wool and green plastic scrubber out of my food, and I've witnessed an armed robbery.  The food is decent, for the hours they're open.    Try Tom's Diner or Eat 'n Park instead.  Heck, go to a grocery store instead."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is (certainly not the food) but I love this place!  Perhaps it's the individual juke boxes, the pie, the sassy waitresses, the 24 hour availability, or the fact that everything here seems to be a hang over cure but I just can not get enough!  I used to live up the street from here and this was definitely my weekend morning hot spot! The food is pretty standard diner food. I've never come here late at night (and probably wouldn't want to) but in the mornings Ritter's is definitely a fantastic spot."}
{"text":"Food is ok and it is kind of greasy spoon.. The decor is interesting."}
{"text":"Ritter's is a solid diner. It is clean and friendly. The food is good but not great. Unlike another reviewer, I'm a fan of their potatoes. I also like the broccoli cheese omelette-- because it's a broccoli omelette topped with cheese sauce, and far as I'm concerned, cheese sauce is a food group.  There are mini jukeboxes in the booths--fun!  The prices are fair. You get exactly what you need and pay for. (Somewhat Soapboxy) In fact, I really like that they do not have enormous Pittsburgh-sized portions. You get regular-sized omelettes or pancakes on normal-sized plates. If you're over 30, you might recognize these portion sizes from your childhood. Frankly, I don't want to overpay AND overeat. (End Soapbox)  Some things to note: --CASH ONLY but ATM located inside --they are no longer open 24/7 but do serve BLD all day when they are open"}
{"text":"Food is good enough. A standard diner in the city that's been here forever. The place is filled with old-timer's who seem to be regulars since the 60's... the waitresses are all middle-aged and would probably get a more youthful & better tipping crowd in here if they used their social skills to converse with their guests rather than talk to each other about their baby daddy issues. Cash-only is a smart move and keeps the menu prices down, though it seems the cashier (owner?) only cares about counting dimes and nickels instead of ensuring guests are satisfied. Nonetheless, a good stop for simple quick and easy diner food. Good luck to all the staff with their personal issues :)"}
{"text":"Pretty basic diner offerings, with very inexpensive prices in a classic setting. The staff here was very friendly and on a Saturday morning, it was busy. My bill was less than $7 for an omelette and home fries. I had the vegetable omelette - nothing impressive, and I thought the home fries tasted very plain. Area for parking so you don't have to search on the street. Not sure I'd return with all of the other great breakfast/brunch options in the area, but gets the job done if you're in a diner mood."}
{"text":"I love Ritter's.  The fried green tomatoes are my favorite.  And judging from the very long lines on the weekend, I am not alone in my love of this place.   Yes, it is a million years old inside and out, and so are the waitresses.  There are 3 or 4 waitresses and they share as many teeth.  But this place is old Pittsburgh and you gotta love it.  The food is good, not amazing...unless you're drunk.  Then it is f---ing fantastic.    As per Pittsburgh standards, even bad food is pretty good if served in large quantities.  You won't leave Ritter's hungry.  You may leave with an infection or rash, but you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!!!  I've been here many times over the years 90% of which I've ordered breakfast.  Diner breakfast easily excites me and this place hits the spot!!  Home fries over hash browns and if my bacon bends and not breaks, then you can get  from me!  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.  I love it here any time of day from early a.m. when the seniors are here to after hours when the drunks are here lol. Thanks for many delicious meals, Ritters, and hopefully more to come :)"}
{"text":"Although it's called a diner, it's much larger than that.  It's open 24/7 and has a full menu.  Tough to fault, especially with good food."}
{"text":"2.5 but I rounded down. This is not a place you go to eat out but it's rather a emergency stop when you have no other place to go perhaps 4 in the morning. Cash only. Doesn't separate the check so if you are eathing with somebody else figure it out among yaselves. I'm not a big fan of diner's and haven't been to one so I don't have anything to compare to but like I said, if you have nowhere else to go you might try this one. Food is ok. It's like the food that a mom who doesn't care for cooking cooked. I don't want to be too mean. Waitresses are friendly. They are dressed up in scrubs like nurses."}
{"text":"I live off of Liberty Ave and everyone kept telling me I needed to try this place, so after 4 months I did.  When my wife and I walked in I thought, this place doesn't look too bad, actually kinda cool.  WRONG!  After being seated it probably took 5 minutes for the waitress to come over and another 5 minutes for our coffee to get to the table.  Our food took about 45 minutes, which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast, but I though, everyone thinks this place is great, I guess I can wait for perfection.   The food gets to our table, it looks good, it looks like breakfast, but it is cold, well mine was cold.  So I'm sitting at the table, empty coffee, cold breakfast and quite pissed off, because of the situation and I'm hungry.  Finally after about 10-12 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is, I tell her my food is cold, and I'm fine and don't need another plate, we had already been there over an hour, we had placed to go, ya know.  When the waitress brings the bill over she doesn't just tell me she took my food off, she says, I figured I would take the food off even though you didn't ask (really?  should I have to?).  Wife's food was hot, but she thought it to be just average breakfast.  I never want to go back, but I will, because I always give places another shot.  Terribly slow service (server was very nice though, probably home from college), and food took forever.  I doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis, because this place wouldn't be so packed and highly regarded."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and our order was taken within minutes. The food took forever though. And it left a little to be desired. You would think with such an extensive menu they would have more toast options, and maybe even more than just watered down fruit (from a can; not fresh). Only toast options are white, wheat, rye. Most diners have the Italian toast like Mancinis or Breadworks. I got the Corinthian omlette which wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. The coffee was good at least.  My wife got poached eggs, the toast (from a bag), and the canned fruit. She tried a buckwheat pancake to taste because it was \"different.\" But it tasted pretty bland."}
{"text":"We were skeptical to eat here based on the mixed reviews. We can now say we've tried it and we probably won't go back. We were greeted by a hostess who sounded and smelled like she just got done smoking. Instead of escorting us to a seat, she told us which tables to pick and to seat ourselves. I ordered the sirloin of beef with mashed potatoes and my fiance got the steak and eggs. The food was just okay. Our server was friendly and attentive. We were thankful we didn't have one of the other servers, who was clearly dying of pneumonia or bronchitis or something. She was coughing up a lung in front of everyone and sniffling every 5 seconds. She washed her hands a lot, but the hostess did not wash her hands upon returning from smoking outside. Kind of gross if you ask me."}
{"text":"Not particularly clean and it took 47 minutes (!!!!!) for our food to arrive once we ordered it. And then of course there was the wait for menus, for coffee, and for our food orders to even be taken. Totally unacceptable. I mean it was busy, but not THAT busy.  Three of us came for breakfast and by the time our food arrived we were \"starving\". But even with that, nothing tasted particularly great. My chocolate chip pancakes had barely any chips, and they were barely warm enough for the butter I put on them to melt. Eggs were bland and not at all fluffy. Corned beef hash was overly salty. Breakfast steak oddly tough. The coffee was good, though, and it was frequently refilled by our friendly waitress. But, that alone is certainly not a good enough reason to ever come back."}
{"text":"Another Pittsburgh institution. Definitely a go-to place on the weekend. Wee hours of the morning after a night at the club when you need cheese fries, pierogis or a giant omelette to get you to sleep. It's like taking a step back in time with the table side jukeboxes in every booth, decor and staff attire. I can only imagine what the staff have had to put up with over the years. So many drunks, so little time. Lol. This greasy spoon diner is a classic; again great for late night munchies with friends as well as meal time with family."}
{"text":"Ritters has been serving food 24 hours a day much longer than I've been alive and are still around so they gotta be doing something right, and they are.  Typical of diners, they have a huge menu complete with your diner staples to some unexpected dishes like spanakopita. Their service is fast and gritty by girls in scrubs. Their food comes out just fast. The quality of the food is above average for diners and definitely better than chain restaurants. I've had the whole gamut of their breakfast food with the buckwheat pancakes being particularly tasty. The eggs are usually cooked correctly as well. I've also tried the chili cheese fries that were glorious after a night of jovial celebrations.  I don't however recommend steak, a friend ordered it and as expected it was not good. If you stick to he staples, it's hard to find better diner food in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for a solid meal, especially breakfast. Dinner and lunch is pretty good too. The menu is rather extensive worth reading all of it since they offer most of it all day long."}
{"text":"I used to live around the corner from this place and worked across the street at the hospital.   Ritters is a great 24/7, greasy spoon diner with adorable vintage juke boxes at the booths, waitresses who have been there forever and patrons who have been lifers as well.   Its certainly not a place to go for health food or fine cuisine, but its great breakfast food and even greater place to be for late night, after the bar, drinking."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Ritters. I love it's location and of course the fact it's open 24/7 but you don't quite get what you pay for, compared to other diners. I do however love their pie! I got the strawberry shortcake and it was very large and delicious, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The best diner in the Burg! The ladies working there make you feel like family and the food is pretty damn good as well. Spaghetti and meat balls were delicious and quite a big serving. I've had breakfast there many times as well and always fabulous! I highly recommend it for an awesome home cooked meal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, incredibly inexpensive, surprisingly tasty - that pretty much sums it up. As long as you come here knowing it is a cheap diner and not expecting something different, you will enjoy your experience. I had the spinach and feta omelet with tomato, which came with a side of hashbrowns. Each of these was great."}
{"text":"I really wanted to  give this a great review, because I have very fond memories of this place when I was a kid with my mom and also when I was in my early 20's hitting this place after 3 AM.  Alas,  I went there this morning and found out it really is just your typical greek diner with a giant menu.  I give it kudos for the jukebox on the tables (Sopranos finale style) and I thought our server was great.  She easily had been doing this for 40+ years.  The atmosphere is good just like any other diner you would go too.  I was here this morning with my friend Fiona and we both needed a hearty breakfast to help with our recovery from the prior night.  The coffee was good and plentiful.  We never had less than half a cup.  I had two poached eggs and white toast.  The eggs were poached perfectly and the bread was appropriately soaked with butter.  All in all this was pretty good.  My bacon was also fine with three healthy strips.  However, Fiona was less lucky.  She had a veggie omelette which was average at best, size doesn't matter with respect to omelettes I'd rather less eggs, but super beaten so the omelette is light.  The veggies were plentiful, but I'd prefer the veggies lightly sauteed, so texturely there isn't such a difference from the eggs to the vegetables.  The sausage was good, but cold.  She asked for crispy bacon and it wasn't crispy at all, in fact it was exactly the same doneness as mine.  The homefries were okay, but I prefer a little more crust on the potatoes.  I'd say this is a perfectly acceptable diner, but I'd recommend you'll enjoy your meal much better if it's at 2 AM in the morning as opposed to 10 AM on a saturday when most of your whits are about you and your palate is not dulled from the Tequila."}
{"text":"Five adults, including three not-small men piled into a Honda Civic on the way to breakfast one Saturday morning.  This had better be good, I thought as we bumped along...  Ritters is a good place to go when other highly attended brunch locales are going through their mid-morning rush as it has two large dining areas to seat customers.  You will definitely get seated and served faster.  The food was good, better than the crappy dinner experience I thought I was going to receive--as Ritters just kind of exudes a 'here-I-am-take-it-or-leave-it' diner kind of vibe.  It wasn't amazing, but it was good.  Also, I paid for three of the breakfasts (myself and the two larger of the men) and somehow none of us went hungry and the bill was just $15 and some change--for three people!  I even had some food left on my plate.  Our server wasn't awesome...she was clearly unhappy to be receiving another table (I'm not assuming, I overheard her say it to another server).  However, she got the job done I suppose (in terms of water glass refill).  Ritters is CASH ONLY so make sure you bring yours! (or someone else who wants to buy you breakfast)"}
{"text":"Ritter's is a classic diner. They cook really good breakfasts and I love their milkshakes.   They feature good hash browns, omelettes, and eggs cooked any way you like them.   It's fun to sit in the booths or at the counter.  I also like their convenient hours. Parking is around the back."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go to eat late at night if you are hungry!!! Open 24 hours."}
{"text":"We came here a few weeks ago for a quick dinner after a trip to the science center. The parking is off to the side and a little bit cramped but it was nice that the did have a lot instead of street parking. We were quickly seated and the waitress came right over to get our order. Everyone was very friendly and they made Anthony's day when he found out they had milk in the little cartons like they have in school. We put our orders in and I got the grilled turkey & swiss. It didn't say on the menu what type of bread it came on and I probably should have asked but when it came out it was on rye which I can not eat. I apologized and we asked the waitress if I could switch and she assured us that it wasn't a problem but apparently the cook felt differently. You could tell he was beyond annoyed when he angrily came out of the kitchen and stared at our table. There was only one other table so he wasn't slammed with orders so I really don't understand why he looked so annoyed but it was pretty uncomfortable. Other than that the food was delicious. Travs burger was huge and Anthony loved his spaghetti and once the sandwich was fixed it was excellent too. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's a throw back to yesteryear...and a longstanding 412 institution. Classic Bloomfield denizens, O.G. jukebox, tight booths and formica table tops enhance the experience. There's a large menu, but you can essentially build your own breakfast from French toast to omelets to various combos. Nothing to write home about, just good ole breakfast blockbusters. Add the endless cup o' coffee and 24x7 schedule (now only on weekends), and you've got yourself a go-to diner for the yinzers. Service was spot on, but as with any greasy spoon you will leave feeling rather grubby."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the appeal other than it's open 24 hours but then again so is Eat n Park which is actually a little better than Ritter's. The food just isn't that great. I actually make a better omelet at home and the other downside is that it's cash only. Yes, they have an ATM on site but it's not from any local bank so the fees are outrageous.  The only breakfast diner in Pittsburgh that was truly spectacular was Jojo's in the Strip which had been replaced by the equally unspectacular Kelly O's."}
{"text":"Went there earlier tonight. Ordered a turkey omelet with tomato and cheddar. Waitress warned me that their cheddar cheese is actually just sauce so I ordered Swiss instead. Omelet arrived overdone with a side of underdone home fries. Took a bite and the turkey was gray and tasted rotten. Tried a few more bites and popped cartilage between my teeth.  It was incredibly chewy and truly the worst thing I've ever received at a restaurant.  When I pushed it away, I could still smell it from the other side of the table. Proceeded to sit there and wait for the waitress to come back so I could tell her about the omelet, but she never returned to our table. I had to walk up to the counter to tell her it tasted old. It was pretty mortifying since I never return food. The one good thing was that she took it off our bill."}
