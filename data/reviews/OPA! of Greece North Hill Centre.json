{"text":"I like this Opa because the owner is a great guy.  I like to see an owner every now and again, it makes me the consumer feel like you actually give a crap about what you serve me.

The food court in this mall isn't the greatest but if I am not at Opa I am at Edo...thats about all I have eaten at this mall.  I usually order the souvlaki platter because of the bread and tatzaki sauce.  I don't care for the rice or potato, really, I think 2 starches are overkill but I usually pick on them and enjoy the salad and meat skewer.  The salad can be hit or miss but I, being quite picky to begin with, have always enjoyed the chicken skewers but what makes the meal for me is the yogurty deliciousness with the bread...I can have that as a meal on its own.

Servings are generous, they offer baklava, but I am quite prejudiced to only eat baklava from the Baklava Factory so that is just a problem with me not Opa...a solid 3.5 stars."}

{"text":"This location is clean and the staff are fast and friendly.  The food is standard for an OPA.  The potatoes are very good.  That is all."}
