{"text":"went for lunch... chose it because it was open and less expensive than a few places bearby.
Overall OK. .. but not a destination resto. 

 My younger friend liked her pasta and her mother seemed to enjoy her pizza. I however was not a fan. I ordered a pizza with chevre and nuts that did not list tomato sauce. I have a mild allergy to tomato and do not always wish to enjoy post meal itchies.  The pizza came with sliced tomato on it. OK it was in part my fault for assuming that they would not add ingredients not listed on the menu...but tomatoes can be scrapped off. More disappointing was the crust. It tasted like it had been frozen and had very little to recommend it. I imagine it would taste much like cardboard-if I knew what cardboard was like to eat. Toppings (goat cheese and nuts) were sparse - I guess that is why they added the tomato slices - they did make it look like there was something on the pizza. 

Our waitress was lovely and very good. My friends both enjoyed their plates. So they lose stars on my food... but make them back up with my friends enjoying themselves and efficient wait staff. 

Can't recommend it as anything more than a slightly-overpriced-for-what-it-is-trying-to-be-better-than-what-it-is place to fill up."}
{"text":"We ordered a 3-cheese pizza, salad and a pasta. The pizza was good, it had a thin crust and it was square(???). Does it change anything taste-wise? I don't think so. The pasta was very good. The salad might be improved but this doesn't mean that it was bad.

They have a very spacious dining hall as well as sidewalk seating arrangement on Rue Mont-Royal and  on Brébeuf Street. Sitting in the dining hall is almost as good as sitting outside because they have big French windows and the tables are placed close to these windows to give maximum outdoor eating effect. 

The service was quick and efficient. All in all a very good experience."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place on our lunch bereak from our very very boring convention which I fell asleep several times.  

It was a nice day and we decided to sit on the outside patio and enjoy the sun and people walking by.  

I had the sausage which was good.  My coworkers had a burger, a grouper fish and some spaghetti which was perfectly done.  

And we all had beer to wash it down."}
{"text":"We love this place and we eat there twice a month since we live next to the restaurant . I love the pizzas and the sandwiches , the salad and the appetizers. Crowded during lunch hour but the service is good. They also have a terrace but the street is noisy."}
{"text":"We ordered a calamari that tasted just ok the Cesar salad was nicely presented but the dressing was too oily and not tasty wasn't creamy enough Caesar salad is easy salad to serve but evrything is in the dressing the price don't matter if the food is good so I would say that salad was too pricy for what we got 
Service was just average the waitress was in hurry to conclude her order and didn't take the time with us too bad for her 15% overall I will not go back soon"}
{"text":"This place is dee-lish!! I went a few weeks ago and had a great experience. They have a nice variety of beer and wine and a cute set-up. I tried the goat cheese appetizer (which was pretty good), the cesar salad (which was amazing!!) and split the Teen Spirit pizza with a rose pasta dish. All of it was so so good. The prices are reasonable and the service was super friendly. I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great service, decent food. Pizza, was subpar.. We had the veggie pizza, odd crust.. Not what we are used to in the NYC area. Pasta was very good. Might return."}
{"text":"Been there with my lady for a late dinner
It was a bad service , waited a long time
For finally had some mistakes in the order

The food was flat, and the music too loud
Gotta avoid keep avoid This place"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Pizzedelic, so I thought it would be fun to give it a try again. My wife and I had dinner here this week with our 2 year old son, and I was very surprised by the poor quality food and the terrible service. 

First let's start with the food. We started with some cod fritters that were overcooked and barely had any cod in then. Then my chicken pizza was so dry and tasteless that I felt like I was eating a piece of cardboard. It was barely edible, and I did not enjoy it at all. My wife had a pasta dish and she thought it was OK but not great, so obviously not all of the food is bad. They have a great deal on a kids pizza - it's just $1 if an adult orders a regular pizza. I actually liked my son's plain cheese pizza better than mine. 

Now the service. It's obvious that the owners hire based on looks, not skill (is that legal?). Everyone is very attractive, but you can tell they hate working there. They did not seem happy that we had a baby, and they did the bare minimum to get us set up with a table. When my son accidentally knocked over and broke a glass (kids will be kids) several of the staff noticed, but not one person came over to help us. We ended up cleaning it all up ourselves. It took us about 5 minutes to get it all clean, and during this time no one came by to see if we needed any assistance, they just totally ignored us. I have never had that happen before at a restaurant. They brought our food, they took our money, all without a smile. These are unhappy people. 

So I give them 1 star for my wife's pasta, and 1 star for the price of the kids food. But I highly suggest you find a different place to eat."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the pizza I ordered. I got the Tyrolienne.. Mushrooms in white wine, smoked ham...

The place is in a nice location, has a patio and a live DJ. I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"El sitio está en un lugar tranquilo y agradable.
El trato fue inmejorable, personal muy atento, educado y cercano.
La pizza nos pareció exquisita, base fina y borde crujiente, buena cantidad de ingredientes y bien combinados. En mi caso probé la teen spririt y repetiría siempre que pudiera!"}
{"text":"Thin, square (that's their gimmick 'our pizza is in a square shape') dry chain-resteraunt pizza that's forgettable. Salads also uninspired."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay. Quite a lot of toppings, and the toppings were tasty (can't remember the name of the pizza, but it was the one with goat cheese, ham, figs, etc). I got the large size (11\"), which was more than enough. Only complaint is that the crust/ base is pretty bad. It's like store bought pizza base. 

Wife got the pasta, and she mentioned that it was only okay. 

Location is cool, service is friendly, and they did have a DJ during dinner time (the noise level wasn't overwhelming... we were on the outside patio and didn't have to raise our voices). 

Also, it's pretty kid friendly. One child can get a kids pizza for $1 with purchase of an adults pizza. And they give crayons."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food, DJ in place and the atmosphere was awsome. I would recommend the smoked salmon pizza."}
{"text":"Decent place to go for pizza and drinks. Service is usually pretty good. Their penne rose is sneaky good though."}
{"text":"It was a Wednesday night, and the place was very busy, a good sign.  The beer selections were good, and there were quite a variety of different types of pizza.  Our 6 year old ordered a pepperoni, but when it arrived there were green peppers and mushrooms on it?  Our server immediately replaced it with a pepperoni- only pizza within about 5 minutes.  The adults ordered pasta dishes that were quite good, and a pizza with asparagus as one of the toppings which was scrumptious!  I don't recall ever seeing asparagus as a topping anywhere else.  Our waiter was personable and attentive.  A nice evening."}
{"text":"I wish there could be seasonal stars... I would give it four stars for the summer and three stars for the winter because I didn't think that either the food or the atmosphere themselves were that special, but I think it's a pretty wonderful place to sit outside and people watch with a drink and a snack when the weather is nice.

The pizza is nothing to write home about, but it was definitely welcome as we were hungry and very happy to eat. Split a larger sized \"Teen Spirit' which was definitely enough food for two when combined with the chorizo app and a couple of beers. If it were sightly cheaper I would be more enthusiastic but I'm not sure the quality of food really met the price.

The service was fine and the restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Je n'y ai jamais mangé sur place mais si j'ai envie d'une pizza livrée c'est là que je commande. Certes elles sont un peu chères pour leur taille, mais elles sont tellement bonnes !!!! La pate est bien croustillante, il y a bien du choix et pour toutes celles que j'ai testé, la garniture était au top !!
Pour ceux qui hésitent je recommande la rocket et/ou la poire calabrese et chèvre :)"}
{"text":"The only thing this lousy Pizzedelic location has going for it is a nice location on Mont-Royal, some good outdoor seating, and funky decor. Otherwise, the food and service is downright bad. Our waitress was dismissive and our food barely edible. My pasta was overcooked, the sauce watery and the mushrooms tasted canned, not fresh. The pizza crust is weird - flatbread like and dry. DEFINITELY drizzle some olive oil over it or you'll feel like you're eating cardboard. A disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"We had passed by this place many times and it always looked happening, so last week we decided to get lunch here. 
We got a table outside as the weather was sunny and perfect for a meal outdoors. 

We ordered pitchers of Sangria and Pizza. We had specifically requested for no bacon on our pizza, however the server mixed it up and included it as a part of the toppings. We brought it up with her and she replaced it for us instantly. Service was efficient and quick! 
Sangria was perfect. Pizza was alright. 
The restaurant has a great vibe though because of which we had a good overall experience."}
{"text":"L'endroit est correct si on veut manger un morceau entres amis, mais on ne s'y prélasse pas trop longtemps. Les cocktails sont fades et donc un peu chers, la pizza y est mangeable mais les saveurs sont le plus souvent mal dosée (Entres autres, ma pizza saumon fumé et gingembre ne goûtait que le gingembre intense..), et on y joue la pire musique de l'univers. Par contre, fans de croutes minces réjouissez-vous! La croute à pizza est ben bonne, mais c'est pas assez pour me donner envie de revenir pour une occasion spéciale. 

Plus pour un stop rapide si je suis avec une gang d'amis difficiles, parce que tout le monde peut y trouver une pizza à son goût, à peu près."}
{"text":"Great flat oven pizza!  Nice decor as well, very clean and new feeling.  Kid friendly without feeling like a family restaurant.  Lots of selection on the menu (of pizzas), so you will please everyone in the group!"}
{"text":"This place would fair better in a town with fewer food options. The pizza is... ok. The service is plain slow. Location is great and they do have a street side terrace, just don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Pizzédélic never disappoints me! I can't seem to stay away from the Bouzouki pizza, which has roasted figs, walnuts and blue cheese, with a super salty sausage that's more like lean bacon. The other great one is the Chili con Carne: a ton of cilantro, blob of sour cream in the middle, and just enough beans. Hey, they have a decent wine selection, too! 
It's a warm, funky interior in this place and the service is wonderful. It's good for a romantic date or a family get-together. 
OH: the cheesecake options! OMG. Stay away if you value your self-respect! These gluttonous wonders will do. you. in. 
Just a hop, skip and a jump away from the Mont Royal metro. 
I'm smitten."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Pizzadelic for a few years and it looks like it was completely renovated since my last visit. The decor is snazzier, the menus are sharp and the service was much better than it used to be.

We were invited to have supper here with friends who loooove mussels and apparently Pizzadelic have all you can eat mussel every Thursday night.

On the menu they have 10 different mussel options to try out... so we went at it like gluttons.

First thing I noticed were the mussels are served in big plates and I recommend digging a hole so you can reach the yummy bottom of the plate first and use all that extra sauce you found to enjoy the rest of the plate. I ended up trying 5 different plates before I simply couldn't go on.

Overall the mussels were quite good here. I recommend ordering your next plate once you get your plate so you only wait about 10 minutes or so between plates. My favorite was by far the basil and pesto. It was quite tasty.

With your food you also get some free fries which are quite good and will keep you busy between servings. I liked the spicy mayo dip. However be cause as you can easily fill yourself up with fries.

Service was good even with the resto being quite busy.

Pizza comes out in a rectangular shape with think crust that looks a lot like flatbread. I had a bite and it was good.

Overall a positive experience to repeat."}
{"text":"Pizzadelic had pretty good pizza. I wouldn't say that it was amazing, but it was tasteful enough. This was one of their specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"I used to come here with my girlfriend (now wife) back in the late 90's, but I don't know what has happened since - has my taste changed, has the resto had new owners? I don't know, but what was once a good experience has dried up and has blown away. First of all, the Jappy clientele are really annoying and grating to have to listen too while trying to unwind, but what can you do about that? Not the resto's fault, just another nail in the coffin for me though.
The server we had was alright, she did her job, but so indifferent and impersonal it was a little offensive. Every time she spoke to us, she would say something rehearsed, but pleasant, but never made eye contact. She would be gawking at another table, anything but us. Rude in any culture.
We ordered a pitcher of sangria - not hard to make. But it had little alcohol and was all ice cubes and obviously tasted like water - stale bar water. Returned it as it was $22 and got a little attitude for it. The pizza was alright. It cam on a mozza like bread and had very little toppings. The cheese was scarce as was the meat, and the taste was nothing to write home about. I had to drown it in the spicy oil they give you for it to be any good. It was an awful choice as it was a rare night out away from our daughter and we blew it here at this place. The bill was pretty steep for a pizza that probably cost them a dollar to make, so that was the last time we go to Pizzadelic. All the spicy oil in the world wouldn't make us go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was unequivocally one of the best  restaurants in Plateau Mont Royal. They offer a plethora of selections for their thin crust pizzas and pastas. The pizza was cooked to perfection and flavorful. One can actually bite into the pizza without worrying about it being too hard,soggy, or nasty . The staff was very friendly and were willing to help translate the menu for us, since we didn't speak French. The overall scenery was very urban chic and you have the option to eat indoors or outdoors. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone just strolling by the area."}
{"text":"We ended up here as we were looking for a late lunch before a train to QC and many other places were closed. I'm so glad we did! They had a lot of choices on their menu of pretty interesting and different pizzas. I tend to be pretty traditional (at least as far as pizza is concerned) so I got mushroom, tomato and basil. It was great! We were able to relax and eat our pizza outside which was nice. My friend got the oreo cake for dessert which was okay, but not stellar. The pizza is great though!"}
{"text":"Always a safe bet!  I love their Harissa mayo and the burgers are amazing.
My son and gf really like the pasta.
The atmosphere is very modern and the food is reliable.
Service can be slow when busy, but nothing terrible.  
This is never my 1st choice but when we do end up here I always love it."}
{"text":"Remarkably good food for a medium-priced pizza place. Just enjoyed a delicious cream of spinach soup followed by a nicely cooked flank steak with peppercorn sauce and fresh vegetables, followed by a WAY better-than-average crème brûlée -- creamy and flavourful. Friendly, efficient & helpful service, too."}
{"text":"I used to live in New York so maybe I have super high standards for pizza. But I really disliked my pizza and would never return. It was crunchy, dry, and the ingredients certainly did not taste fresh. The service was so-so (not very friendly). The decor was nice."}
{"text":"Waited over 29 mins for my pizza! Yes you got it 29! I had to order a salad to cut down my appetite. The pizza is like one of those you buy in a freezer from a store, its just double the price. It was a sad pizza that didn't taste good. The staff was unfriendly, no apology  for the long wait."}
{"text":"Il y a plusieurs années que je n'avais pas mis les pieds dans un Pizzédélic, plus de 10 ans. Celui-ci a été rénové. Il est très beau avec un vu sur une IMMENSE cave à vins. 

J'ai commandé la salade à la bavette. C'est toujours crève cur de payer 18$ pour une salade. Quand elle est décevant c'est encore plus crève cur. La laitue et les garniture était correct, mais ce qui a rendu le tout décevant c'est la bavette qui était raide, peu gouteuse et d'une couleur grisâtre comme si elle avait plus bouilli que grillé. 

Mes collègues semblaient aimé leur pizza par contre, reste que c'est leur spécialité. 

Je préfère Ottavio de l'autre côté de la rue."}
{"text":"En famille avec deux enfants. Accueil et Service agréable. Salade correct et pizza aussi, un peu trop salée."}
{"text":"Square pizza on a cracker, I would have expected this novelty not last as long as it did, but it's still around. Quite a few have closed in the last two decades but the survivors have been some what revamped.

I remember when first open, it was a new and fresh experience.  Pizza was tasty but you did feel like ordering a second or third one as one individual portion felt like the focaccia appetizers you would get at some good Italian restaurants.

Ok, so nothing good to say on the portions, but wanting more was due to the fact it was tasty and good.  It's probably been over 10 years since I've had one but when Enoteca Mozza and Bottega were filled to the brim last night, it was a very reluctant choice over what are two great places to eat some pie.

Should have gone with my instincts and tried harder convince my better half to drop her pizza craving.

Pizza was bland and skimpy.  The charm of a crispy cracker as the base was quickly over as it was now just soft compressed piece of wonder bread.

What used to be the deal maker for them, the olive oil infused with chili peppers to pour all over your dish, was colored canola oil.  Here is a tip for them;  When the oil runs out in the serving vessel, don't top it up with more oil, dried chili peppers can only stretch out so much and will reach a point where there is no more heat to infuse the oil.

Oh well.... guess bad food is the price you pay to get a table outside on the terrace on a beautiful Friday night. Nothing worse than settling for mere convenience.  Maybe in 10 years I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"The customer service so was great! Very friendly. The cesar salad was delicious. If we lived in Canada, we would come back."}
{"text":"If you are in Montreal and you need a small pizzeria with decent food than you might want to take a look at this place. It is pretty small and dark so if I were you I would sit on the terrace if there's room. The service isn't bad and it does not take too long for the food to arrive. The fries there are great as well as the mayo they serve with it. The salad is also pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of the pizza there however that is my opinion. The rest of the dishes are nothing special. Overall it's a nice little place to have a quick meal if youre in the area."}
{"text":"At my surprise the food improved alot after renovation. The restaurent was full however the service was fast, professional and our witress very helpfull. The new look is much better than the one before. Very tasty meals and generous portion. We all enjoyed it even the kids. I highly recommend to give it a try."}
{"text":"cute place! looks like an old car garage as in for fixing.

walked by and saw square red baron like pizzas, was hungry and stopped in. the menu has a lot of options many of which are inventive little pizzas from thai styled to spanish. we went with the andalucian one, cause it reminded me of home (spain).

the house red wine wasnt bad either!

The pizza was good, if you like that style of pizza (frozen pizza) but want it to not suck like Red Baron. The Anadaluce was good, but i swear it had some form of sausage that wasn't chorizo, it tasted more like andoille or regular suasaginess."}
{"text":"If you like coal or brick oven pizza as I do, you would NOT like pizza here. I was very disappointed. 
Yeah, the square-shaped pizza was cute and creatively and all, but served lukewarm, not crispy, toppings not fresh.

The only exciting thing happened while we were there:
We sat by the window (the entire wall was an open window). A topless man rushed in and shouting in French which I had no clue. He made all staff came out to block him from jumping into the cashier counter. I was disappointed that no one explained to us what was happening. Anyway, the half naked man left, still with great unknown rage. And a few minutes later, a cop car pooled over like it would do in a movie. The cop car only made a noise when crossing the road (unlike any cop cars in Manhattan \"alarming\" all the time). Two handsome well-fitted young cops came out of the car and asked a person on the street where the man was. They ran into the pointed store across the street. 
I was like \"so cool\". My bf said at least this pizzeria offered some good view on this live cop show."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, great food! Above All,outstanding service especially in the bar section. Merci Annie!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant twice within 5 days. I had a green salad and a pizza the first time and both of them were very delicious. My other visit I had a pasta and I wasn't too impressed. Service is great and the prices are reasonable. Overall a great choice for a simple dinner out."}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed with my experience here. I came for supper with a friend during the week and even though the restaurant was not too full we waited a long time for service and were not checked on very frequently. While the service wasn't particularly bad , it wasn't particularly good either . Our waitress wasn't rude but seemed distracted. The same can be said for the food it wasn't horrible but it wasn't great , the pizza was ok , it didn't taste bad or anything but wasn't particularly tasty the cheese and toppings lacked flavour and the dough wasn't cooked super well (I had a chicken pizza and my friend had a veggie pizza). For the price compared to what you get I really don't think that I would come back here when there are so many great pizza places on monkland. I am pretty shocked though because this place usually seems pretty full so maybe I went on an off night. This wasn't a bad experience overall but really didn't stand out to me in any way, and while it wouldn't be somewhere I would necessarily go back to , I wouldn't discourage anyone from giving it a try for themselves."}
{"text":"Hey all.  Well, here goes nothing. Lol.  

I'm reading some of the reviews and I'm not sure why they would give 1 star here??  I suppose they had a single bad experience but for me I wouldn't do that unless it's been a few times.  

I have only been here once but it was really good.  My friend and i both ordered pizzas and salads.   The salads were out in 2 minutes and the pizzas were out within a minute or two of finishing the salads.  The pizza isn't like Dominoes or an Americanized type pizza but is rather on a rectangular shaped dough that is more similar to a flatbread.  It was really good and didn't give me the heart burn, bloated gut feeling you get with a lot of other pizza places.  I really enjoyed it and the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  

I finished the meal with an espresso that comes with a small chocolate wafer!  

I will definitely be back.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So today we went back to Pizzadelic to give them another chance. They had to be about 5 tables besides us.

I had the Pizza which was good, my Girlfriend didn't really like her Calimari, she said it tasted reheated.

Everything was decent, the only thing that concerned me was that there was 3-4 tables that arrived after us who's order was taken after ours, and recieved there food before us.

As a client, seeing that can be a little concerning, and being someone who works in the restaurant industry, it's a big no, no.

There is other places i will choose, before i go back here."}
{"text":"I am a big big fan of Pizzadelic.  This restaurant/brand has been around for a long while, probably since 1995ish as far back as I can remember.  Probably longer.  They ended up expanding to many locations around Montreal and Quebec ... and THAILAND!  I actually recall surfing the Internet enjoying one of these exotic gourmet pizzas in Phuket, Thailand in 1997! wow ... that was a long time ago.
Whatever -- not a \"chain\", but certainly consistent quality.  This one up on the plateau is great for lounging around, serves alcohol too!  My other fav location in Montreal is on St. Denis near Ontario st.
Every pizza they offer is a taste sensation that you may not have guessed.  Their classic thin crust gives it a very light feeling, not to sit like a PizzaHut brick in your gut allowing you to skip to my lou out and about on your merry way.  Enjoy some Pizzadelic already.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza I've ever had.  The crust tastes like stale crackers.  The service is ok and the location is fine, somewhat up-scale fast food, but the pizza was close to inedible.  The salads (even the larger) were also quite skimpy for the price."}
{"text":"Lovely place to bring your best half! Thin pizzas with extremely creative toppings. Delicious is the best word to describe it. The problem is that you will never know which one you will choose... So, you'd better know that you will have to come more times...

For appetizer, try the bruschetta... I just can't find words to define it. OMG...

My second time here and I'm already planning to come back..."}
{"text":"I really don't get the negative complaints.

Pizzedelic is in a great location, presents a trendy yet casual atmosphere, offers a brilliant and diverse menu and - bottom line - the pizza is very good; being from Boston, I should know!  Now, I'm not going to say it is the best pizza I experienced (that was actually in London), but will say that if you find yourself in the Plateau neighborhood of Montreal one lazy afternoon, and are in the mood for pizza while you sit and watch the world pass you by on Mont-Royal Est, this is the place to go.    

A meal that is relaxing, offers reasonable pricing, and presents a nifty vibe easily makes  a fan out of me!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas with gluten free options. Decently large menu and pretty nice staff. I would recommend on the regular menu (as a basic starter pizza) the 'Mozzarella and Garlic' and off the 'Nirvana' menu the 'Teen spirit' (pesto, mozzarella, olives, tomatos)
(full review coming soon)"}
{"text":"Un endroit très sympathique sur Mt-Royal. J'y suis allé tellement souvent avec ma fille de l'âge de 7 ans à 14 ans et je n'ai jamais été déçu."}
{"text":"Power. Hard to come by, even harder to sustain, and even more difficult still than the prior to resist. Much like a good pizza joint. 

Like any good restaurant experience, the lemon water came out as soon as we arrived. It was so fucking good. Upon finishing our first vase of lemon water a second round of water found its way to the table without us asking but this time things were different. Lemonless water. 

Moving on.

The pizza is square. A stable shape. A domestic, homely shape. 

It was pretty good. I'm going to go eat more now Be right back. 

Back! 

My thoughts are that it's not that special. It's very salty! It really is a different pizza experience and if you're looking to shake it up give it a try, don't hesitate, don't give it a second thought."}
