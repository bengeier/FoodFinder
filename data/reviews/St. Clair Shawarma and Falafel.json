{"text":"What can I say? This is an absolutely delightful addition to the St. Clair W area. I've been grabbing quick lunches and dinners here regularly since the place opened and have been consistently pleased with the quality of the food; the falafel balls are made to order (4 balls/pita) and have the right balance between well cooked outside and moist inside. The cooks are incredibly generous with the various fillings. The chicken shawarma is also excellent. The meat is succulent and well spiced, and when purchased in a pita you get the same generous helping of veggies.

The prices are incredibly fair ($4.50 after tax for a falafel pita, a dollar or two more for the chicken shawarma) and service is quick. I'd highly suggest that you try this place out soon before it gets too busy - with high quality and low prices, this place is going to get slammed by the crowds soon."}
{"text":"Great Shawarma, generous servings. 
Falafel was also good. 

Selection of salads, pickles and condiments will put King Falafel to shame with their one tomato salad drenched in Tehini.

An Israeli friend spoke highly of the place, and I was not disappointed. 
The Shawarma must go on !"}
{"text":"This review is mostly about the service at St. Clair Shawarma and Falafel.  The falafels we had were pretty decent.  Solid three stars.  But the service was just...well...torturously slow.

To be fair, we put in a large order.  10 falafels to go (we were the designated picker-uppers for our family that evening), so we expected to wait a little while.  But this was frankly an operations nightmare.  Everything was so darn inefficient!  I wanted to hop behind the counter and help the guy out, but instead I waited helplessly for 40 minutes (that's 4 minutes per falafel, if you're keeping track) looking at him hack away at cucumbers and onions (he had run out at 6pm), cook falafel balls one at a time, walk back and forth to get bags from the same pile again and again.  My business school inner voice was screaming:  Why don't you cook the second batch of falafels WHILE you're making the first 5 sandwiches instead of waiting until you realize you're out of them?  Etc...

Let's put it this way.  I may have almost flunked operations (hey, it's hard!) but I know that 10 falafels don't take 40 minutes to make.  I also felt so bad for the other couple of customers that came in while this was going on.  Sorry, guys.  We'll never put in a big order again!

Vegetarian Score: 6/10.  Falafels, yes, but mostly meat at this joint.  There also aren't the yummy salads (like Tabbouleh) and dips here that tend to show up at falafel stands.  It's mostly fried fish and chicken and shawarma."}
