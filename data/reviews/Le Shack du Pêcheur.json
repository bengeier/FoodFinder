{"text":"What great little restaurant in a industrial area. We were camping nearby and did not want to go far. They did not disappoint. Although they are famous for the fish and chips I had the burger with onions straws and grilled shimp. Great combo. And the chipotle mayo had just the right heat. My wife had the pasta with seafood (mussels,shrimp etc). She loved it. Good selection of Beers on tap (6). It seemed like a lot of locals were there which is always a good sign.Writing this review is making me hungry.I think i'm going to go there for lunch."}
{"text":"Un super fish and chips !! Le cadre est sympa, le service aussi. Les différents fish&chips sont très bon, et les assiettes bien pleine. J'ai également beaucoup aimé la poutine au homard. Je recommande vivement"}
{"text":"The fish is really fresh, I've tried lots of fish and chips places and this place remains on top on my list. I love the ambiance and the decor. The terrasse is really cute. The price is also fair. Definitely worth the detour if you're not from the area. The only thing I would improve is increase the parking space."}
{"text":"Super bon et mignon resto de fruits de mer sur la rive-sud! Service sympa et rapide. Nous avons pris un fish and chips une guéduille aux homard, le tartare de saumon et des boules de mac n cheese et tout était bon! Sans compter la crème brulée comme dessert un vrai délice! Un resto a découvrir à la prairie :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant offrant un menu original et délicieux .un peu dispendieux par contre. Le cadre est agréable le service acceptable sans plus."}
{"text":"What can I say but wow! Comfy seafood shack atmosphere reminds me of Newfoundland cozy lobster shacks. I had their infamous London fish and chips and was not disappointed. Just make sure you make your reservations at least 2 weeks in advance as they are very busy."}
{"text":"Everything that I ate was excellent! Clam chowder was not thick but very rich in flavour without a fishy taste.  Steamed clams are the best I ever ate! Small clams but the flavour was great! Lobster rolls were awesome at $8 each.   Two for $22 fish and chips on Sunday and Mondays is very, very good. 8 ways to order it and just as many dipping sauces.  Best little seafood restaurant on the south shore and definitely worth coming too. Family friendly and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Cute place ,always passed by and wanted I go in. Finally went for supper with the in-laws (one of them had eaten there before). Turns out the menu was re-evaluated and things got more expensive portions for a little smaller. The food was average, presentation was A+. In my opinion a little expensive for the taste. But should try it at least once."}
{"text":"I second Sheryl L. nice quaint little place but average food and above average price. (soup and a main for 2 with pitcher of beer didn't leave much change from $170)  Service / Waiter a bit abrupt but seemingly less so to what we took to be regulars. Will return to give it another chance and try the fish n chips."}
{"text":"This was our first time there. The food was excellent, so was the service. Very casual decor and ambiance. Will definitely return. The Fish & Chips were perfect. They even serve mushy peas just like the Brits do. Whoever owns and operates this eatery knows his fish and seafood. Can't wait to try their tartares. The tuna tataki was superb. Fries to my liking and they offer malt vinegar. Quite the pkace for seafood."}
{"text":"Amazing food, not so great service. We sat down and it took quite a while to actually get asked our order. Once it arrived everything was delicious. It seemed as though if you knew the owners service was faster. Definitely will be going back but only because the food was so good."}
{"text":"Great place and great atmosphere. Restaurant parking space is limited, but there are many available nearby. Food is good too, but the price may be a bit higher than average."}
