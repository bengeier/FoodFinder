{"text":"Love the atmosphere here, great place to hang out before dinner. We were pleasantly surprised to find out there is a brand new delicious food menu! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place until yesterday. The bartender was rude! I honestly haven't seen such rude and negative service like that ever. It took her forever to make my martini and after my husband and I finished our first drinks, she proceeded to ask him what he wanted but didn't ask me. So I finally told her what I wanted and she didn't know how to make it (I ordered a sex on the beach, which I'm pretty sure is a drink bartenders know how to make). I probably will never return to this establishment again."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in the Falls. The beer selection is extensive.  They always have a great selection of craft beer that will please no matter what your taste may be. Food has been reduced to a few cold meat and cheese plates since they got rid of the kitchen, but it is a bar and not a restaurant.  The bartenders are great:  sociable and attentive."}
{"text":"A nice surprise along the river. A comfy bar with a good beer selection at reasonable prices. The environment was enjoyable, and there was a good mixture of people. Didn't enjoy the one stall bathroom, I had to wait in line many times and that tends to create awkward, but interesting conversations."}
{"text":"Craft beer on tap, only. Domestic only in bottles. Food, friendly waitstaff, agreeable bar crowd. Not terribly expensive. Very nice place.   I will be a regular. That's a sign of a good bar."}
{"text":"Whenever we sit up front by the bar, the service is great, but every time i've sat at a table in the back (twice) the service was slow as can be.  Regardless, the food is really very good.  Limited menu, but it's a bar, so if you don't want a sandwich or pizza, you should probably go elsewhere.  Beer selection is through the roof, so if you're a craft brew drinker like myself, this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here for drinks with a friend of mine on a Friday, and I had such a great time. We sat in a 2 person booth in the bar area, and the bartender came over right away to grab our drink order. We each had 2 of their handcrafted cocktails (can't remember which ones off the top of my head), but they were really good and had plenty of alcohol in them (another one, and I would have had to call an Uber to get home). I would love to go back and try their food menu. Thanks for the great night!"}
{"text":"We had a great pizza and salad here while waiting for time at the shooting range.  I was relieved that they accept credit cards now!"}
{"text":"Updating review to state that they now have food here (again).  They turned the bourbon tasting room back into a kitchen and outsourced that to The March Hare for food offerings.  Wise move in my opinion.  If I could I would increase my rating to 3.5 stars.  If I had tried the food (we already ate dinner) I may have even increased my rating to 4 stars - menu was small but looked good!  Next time..."}
{"text":"Delightfully surprised with the martini flight, delivered on large ornate spinning structure with a dude of Andes mints. Way too sweet and still perfect."}
{"text":"Casual, clean, friendly and funky all at the same time - I'm constantly introducing my friends to this great bar. Female friendly - as in I don't feel weird or uncomfortable coming here which says a lot. Great atmosphere with distinct areas in front and back that let you enjoy a big crowd or an intimate experience. Craft cocktails are good at $10/ea and now serving food as well. I love Infuse days when they prepare a beer with special flavors for a limited run."}
{"text":"The beer, drink and wine list is very good for this quiet little place. Very good beer selection! Friendly atmosphere. They have outdoor seating at the main entrance and an outdoor deck with nice space. Great place to try out if you have never been here!"}
{"text":"The beer selection here is above average and the bartenders are highly knowledgeable about their selection.  The bar snacks are pretty good and come out extremely quickly."}
{"text":"Cool little place, nice vibe. Definitely a hipster hangout. Mixed drinks the night we were there tasted good but were weak and mostly ice. Servers friendly enough.  Will probably try it again but wouldn't be my first choice place to get a drink."}
{"text":"grab your wallet. Go during happy hour. They did have good happy hour pricing on some of their expensive cocktails but after happy hour. This location should be labeled $$$."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food, because I only go for drinks. They've got a really nice patio open in the summer months. The 4/$22 martini sampler is a steal."}
{"text":"5 out of 5 Stars one of the best craft beer and craft cocktails establishments in Akron the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and makes outstanding recommendations highly recommended"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the tribe game and a quick bite to eat.  They had a tribe shirt giveaway and beer specials till game time.  Bartenders are very friendly  and attentive.  The food is good and the drinks are tasty.    They also have trivia on tue/ thurs, wine specials on wed.  They are closed on Monday.  Definitely an all around good time.  There is a lounge area in the back and a patio when the weather is good!"}
{"text":"THEY NOW TAKE CREDIT.  The cricket is truly a gem in Cuyahoga Falls. The martini and beer selection are always a welcome surprise. The food is prepared fresh and always delicious. The prices are fair and not too expensive. Check them out- you will love this cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place with some creative cocktails. I'll be back for happy hour for sure."}
{"text":"Good service, ok atmosphere, prices are fine.  There was a sign saying \"no men's tanks allowed\".  We thought it was a joke, but they were about to kick my friend out unless he wore one of their shirts.  Their manager obviously is trying to make the place seem a lot classier than it actually is, and is ignorant of his discriminatory policies.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Update: The Cricket no longer serves food, aside from bar snacks. They've transitioned & refocused into solely a bar, albeit a more upscale one than Cuyahoga Falls is used to. It's a great space, with a bar & tables as well as some comfy couch seating. The front patio faces the Riverfront, & the back porch, overlooking Burtnwood Tavern & facing out toward the river, is always jam-packed in nice weather. The Cashmere Cricket is a bit pricier than other CF-area bars, but it's also a lot nicer than most of them. A nice spot to have in town, especially on the sometimes-worriesomely-floudering Riverfront. It seems like this is one of those places that will keep foot traffic coming."}
{"text":"My review is for the bar only- we did not try the food on this trip. We sat in the cozy front bar, killing some time on a Saturday night. It was just about full, but the kind bartender rearranged some chairs to accommodate us (and turned on the Ohio basketball game for my husband). We found the Cricket to be a lovely grown-up bar, with music that doesn't cause you to have to yell at your drinking companion and enough lighting to be able to read the menu. We were very impressed by the beer selection, choosing a few selections from the eight on draft. They have an extensive bottle menu, too. I'll be back when I'm in the neighborhood, and hope to try the food next time."}
{"text":"As a gluten free vegetarian I give this place two thumbs down. Ventured into this on suggestion from a friend who raved about the place. I was slightly optimistic when they mentioned the vast beer selection (because in my experience places that specialize in artisan beer normally have at least 2 gluten free beer selections). There was 1 gluten free beer selection, Angry Orchard. Strike 1. I then turned to the food selections. Emphasizing the \"selections\". There were 3-4 appetizers (I don't remember exactly because I couldn't eat any of them), salads, sandwiches, or pizza. So, salad for me. Strike 2. The salad was delicious, but at the end of the night I realized I spent $20 on two ciders and a salad. The final strike of the night for me was the service. They didn't seem that busy (they were pretty full, but most were just drinking), but it took a full hour and a half before we got food.   I think that this place would be great to jump in for a couple of drinks, but definitely NOT for dining."}
{"text":"A great craft beer bar. I love the lounge seating and atmosphere there. The drinks are a bit pricey but still my favorite craft beer bar."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat while waiting for a friend.  Nice bar area when you enter with more traditional restaurant tables in back.  Staff was really friendly and nice which was really appreciated.  I had two appetizers - the egg rolls and a dish called panama shrimp.  The shrimp - O. M.G.!!  Large gulf shrimp wrapped in bacon served with a chipotle BBQ sauce, the shrimp were nicely cooked and the bacon crisp and it was just to die for!!  The egg rolls had portobello mushrooms with a hot mustard sauce on the side and again, fabulous!  The main menu had sandwiches like turkey reubens, grilled four cheese sandwiches, pizzas and an assortment of salads, but the apps are what I am coming back for!  Have to pay cash, no credit, but do worth the extra effort!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try a new place tonight before going out to see a movie. So we checked out the Cashmere Cricand wow! The drinks were stttrroooooonnngggg but delicious. I decided on the Peach Old Fashioned and my boyfriend decided on Sparkling Strawberry Lemonade (mostly because I couldn't decide between the two!) the peach bourbon they infuse themselves, as well as many other liquors at their bar. The bartenders and the servers but they are very attentive, and super friendly! Both of our drinks were only $5 as a part of the $5 happy hour (happy hour is Tuesday-Friday 4pm-6pm). They drinks came out quickly and we were able to order within 10 minutes of arriving. I ordered the Pork Belly and my boyfriend ordered the Braised Lamb Ribs. Both were very delicious. The only downside was that the portions were kinda small for the price (hence why this is not a 5-Star review). After we finished our meals we asked for the Banana S'mores Tart and the server had to go back and check if they had any left because they ran out of bananas the night before. The server came out with a motorcycle helmet and said \"we are out but I'm going to get you some bananas! I'll be back in 5 minutes\". We were speechless!! That was definitely the first time anything like that had happened to us (and they didn't know I was going to write a yelp review!). The dessert was AMAZING! Warm and gooy with the perfect crunch on the tartlets! I wish I could give this a 5 star, and I would if the portion sizes were a bit bigger for what you are paying for."}
{"text":"I used to love the Cricket. Lately, however, the service has been HORRIBLE. It's almost like they don't want to take my money. I'm just drinking, it's not that hard. Always order a bomber, cause you'll go through it before a waitress checks in on you. In fact, I've written this entire review before a waitress brought my check back. the food used to be good too. Now... Not so much. It might be a while before I visit the Cricket again.  I must say, they have the best beer selection in the Falls. That earns them the second star. Here's to hoping that your second beer arrives before your patience runs dry."}
{"text":"Bangin' martinis and surprisingly good pizza!"}
{"text":"I've visited a few times, but usually just for a quick drink on the way home.  This time I went for the Trivia on Sunday night.  I got in early, and was watching some golf on one of the big TV's and noticed that they had a new food menu.  I ordered the Firecracker Shrimp Tacos, and simply: Awesome!  Nice presentation, and great taste.  Very pleased.  I has some fun playing trivia too.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Good high end beer and drink selection. Very nice inside. A good spot for the Akron area which needs a lot more of them."}
{"text":"Food took over an hour and a half - for grilled cheese, really? Good service - just super slow food."}
{"text":"Great place for crafted cocktails & an array of cool beers & basic bars snacks. No food for about a year now"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this establishment... nice wine selection, my husband likes the beer list and the small plates/ appetizer selection is very good.  But, I'm  really disappointed that you're allowing smoking on the patio!  I love al fresco dining ; don't want to have to deal with smoke!"}
