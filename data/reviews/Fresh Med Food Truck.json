{"text":"Tyler and his crew did a wonderful job for our client event at Sycamore Brewing last week. The food was delish and the service outstanding! We will definitely have his truck again at an event. A great time was had by all!"}
{"text":"What a great experience today! Definitely the biggest food truck I've seen and nice music while you wait for food. This crew put a lot of thought into this Mediterranean Fusion menu. We devoured the Greek ceviche salad, fettuccine Alfredo balls, kefta and homemade humus. All of it was delicious and made from scratch. I wish we had room for the dessert. The pistachio almond filled pastry puff, rolled in local honey (good God), looked amazing.  We will be following this truck around, thank you for a great meal!"}
{"text":"We went to the LoSo Block Party Saturday totally by accident. We were headed to Sugar Creek and stumbled upon the festivities.

Aside from the pain-in-the-a$$ coupon thing and limited menus at the breweries/food trucks, I was delighted to see the Fresh Med CLT food truck once again ;)

As a returning customer, this time I had the Greek Chicken Salad....it was the bomb! Fresh and light...just perfect when paired with a Sugar Creek White Ale :)  

If you crave fresh food, look no further!"}
{"text":"Brought my dad to try this during his visit, and he's now obsessed with their peri peri sauce. He said best lamb burger he's had in a while!"}
{"text":"I tried this at Matthews food truck Friday, and the food was pretty good, but the wait was ridiculous. I know it was a crowded event, but I was told it was a 20 minute wait and ended up waiting almost 50 minutes. No apologies, no \"thanks for waiting\" or any acknowledgment of the excessive wait. As I said, I know it was a crowded event, but Fresh Med should have also known and been prepared for the crowds. 

I had the \"lamburghini pita\" and it was okay, the meat was overcooked and was very crumbly, the spicy sauce added a lot to the pita, but it was not worth a 50 minute wait."}
{"text":"Great food truck with fresh food and friendly staff. 

The food truck was parked right off McDowell (somewhat behind Dilworth Grille). I walked over with a few coworkers and immediately noticed how much this food truck stood out compared to others. It was wrapped with vibrant colors and a built in TV on the side. 

The menu is simple but has a fair amount of options. I went with the Spartacus and was very happy with my choice. Within 5 minutes I was carrying back the food to my office in a visually appealing box. 

Upon sitting down and eating, I knew I made the right choice. It all tasted fresh and I could tell quality was definitely something they focused on. It was the perfect amount of food. 

I can't wait to find this one around town so I can stop in and grab a few different items because I know I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Picked up a bite to eat after climbing at Inner Peaks (Monday location for Fresh Med).  Got the lamb burger and took it home.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, though it was quite spicy - definitely tasted the onions and spices for a few hrs after.  Portion was a bit small for the price which is why I'm only giving four stars, but the cooking was quick and the trick looked beautiful.  Great addition to the CLT food truck scene!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing. My friend and I were at Sugar Creek last night and decided to check them out. First, they have online ordering which is super convenient. They were also super helpful when my friend asked for a weird request (she's currently eating paleo so...). I ordered the Chicken Saltimbocca Sandwich and the Fettuccini Alfredo Balls. The FAB were good but the sandwich was unbelievable. My friend and I couldn't believe how fresh everything tasted. You should absolutely check them out!"}
{"text":"By far some of the best food I've had from a food truck. A co-worker had a craving for falafel and we decided to try Fresh Med since it was near us today at the NASCAR Hall of Fame. 

First off, this truck is massive. They have a large digital menu screen and an intercom screen which makes it so much easier to call out orders in groups.

We ordered the fried fettuccine balls to split as an appetizer. It was good that we did because they were large and a heavy dish. It had a good creamy flavor. I wish they just sold a fettuccine dish separately. 

I ordered the Lamborghini Pita and it was one of the most amazing sandwiches Ive ever had. The portion is huge.  The naan is soft. The lamb is flavored well. There's tons of fresh veggies on top. And the chimichurri sauce gives it a spicy kick dropping a flavor bomb in your mouth. I wish there were some sort of tzatziki sauce on the side or to dip it in, but it was still very good without it. 

My co-worker got the falafel pita and it was good, but she said it needed a little more sauce or something because it was a little dry. 

I didn't get any food pictures because I devoured my sandwich too quickly. I'm excited to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Fresh Med remember name
I just had it today now it's all on my brain 
Yo I'm seeking more
I hear on Fridays you're outside of Sycamore
So Im thinking more, maybe next Friday
\"You don't wanna go against them\"'s what I'll say to Flay
I got the Lamb Burger, me and my brother
I was thinking \"dang we might wanna get another\" 
Temp was 89 but that cucumber salad on the side made it feel like sixty five
I'm thinking it's a bummer if you never even tried it...
So get your table set, 
eating Fresh Med is one step to living life with no regrets."}
{"text":"This food truck is where it's at!! If you haven't grabbed a bit from Fresh Med, what are you waiting for??

I'm always excited when I see these guys parked at a bar near my work in Pineville!

The Sparticus was my go-to order, which you can't go wrong, but I have recently started to branch out and try their other delicious choices.

And to add to the amazing eats, these folks are super friendly!! Find them near you today!"}
{"text":"Chicken Saltimbocca. Words that I don't typically associate with a food truck, but there it was, staring at me. Begging me to try it out.
I've only had Fresh Med once, and that was at Blue Blaze's 1 year anniversary party, which happened to be Fresh Med's anniversary as well. Service was kind and quick (although there wasn't a giant line, so I don't know how they operate in full production). I did order the Chicken Saltimbocca sandwich, which turned out very well cooked, juicy, and extremely flavorful. The sandwich was on the smaller side, but it was packed with deliciousness. 

Can't wait to try out the rest of their offerings, and I'll definitely be adding this to the list of trusted trucks in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Quick & Tasty! You will need napkins!!

Best tip about this food truck: it's worth getting the fettuccine alfredo balls, but its definitely a sharing/splitting item - super heavy food!"}
