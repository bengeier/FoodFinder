{"text":"Old school, almost rustic style food court shop has wide variety of options, but it's got less than a tenth of it's menu in English... Nonetheless, decent portion sizes, freshly cooked, and good flavour.

The curry mutton ($8.50) was slightly more expensive than the beef brisket, which I might try next time. Unfortunately, most of the pieces are bone on... But it's got that gamey flavour! Lots of peppers and carrots mixed in with the curry give it a mild kick (wait for it, it sneaks up on you). A good mix of sauce and rice - I finished the meal without wasting a drop!

I also got the claypot rice. The woman was worried I wouldn't be able to finish both meals, but I told her I can handle it ez... She was right to warn me though: two is a fair sized portion (but for the record, I finished it easily.) This one, as she warned, took about half an hour to prepare - but that's why I got the curry mutton too!

Claypot rice had three kinds of meat: sausage slices, dried/flavoured duck, and \"lap yuk\" (dried/flavoured pork), along with a handful of tong choi, a kind of tasty and healthy Chinese vegetable. The duck was mostly bone, and there wasn't nearly enough sausage or lap yuk... But the rice was delicious!


Both meals came with a small soup.

Overall, a fine choice."}
{"text":"I had the minced pork and preserved egg congee ($4) about a week ago. Heads up, it's not minced pork. It's also not the traditional lean pork. This is pork cubes, not stringy, lean pork. It's also been marinated. I quite enjoyed it. There was a decent amount of this pork, and also of preserved egg. I appreciate that my congee had flavor, even though I was sick. All in all, good stuff. 

My parents like to come here for their steamed fish. I had never come close enough to the stall to notice, but on the left side of their stall, they have a fish tank. I thought it was filled with pet fish. I was wrong. I'm pretty sure the fish they use in their steamed fish dishes are swimming around in that tank. Wow. That's dedication to freshness!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken congee even though sometimes the bones are in the way. Still very tasty and fresh. The clay pot rice is great! Perfect for cold weather. The dumplings are my hubby's fav. Ask for the complimentary soup or soy drink when you order a meal. I like it here cos it's not your normal food fare. Much more country style and fresh. Should call ahead to order and try not to go during weekends or lunch time. I think they're closed on Wednesdays. Parking is not great. So better to bring a family member or friend to wait in the car."}
{"text":"Pot rice, congees, rice rolls, noodle soups, stir fries, stews, steamed fish, steamed ribs and many more very traditional cantonese foods. Some of these dishes most cantonese family may cook on a daily basis. If you like these kinds of food, then nothing beats this place.

Prices are cheap, decent size portions, and most things are very tasty, what's not to like here? The wait time!!! I know it can take a while to cook pot rice, but average wait time is like 30 min at least, even if you call ahead of time. I've waited for a hour for my food a few times. Not just once or twice either, many times. Seems like they need more hands, but good help is hard to find I guess, always only 2-3 people working in the kitchen. Also, you need to read Chinese because their menu is not very English friendly. It's located in the silver star food court, a little ghetto, not really for any special occasions.

Look pass those issues and you have a great place to eat on the cheap.

{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in a Asian plaza hear Midland and Steeles. It's right next to the no frills and it's inside the \"silver star food court\" (I think that's what it's called) 

This joint has your classic Cantonese dishes like congee, cheung fun, pot rice, noodles etc... my personal favourites are the congee and cheung fun combos, spareribs with black  bean sauce on rice, and of course the fresh steamed fish meal for $8. They even have an aquarium with the fishes swimming in it tucked to the side.

For the steamed fish it's $8 you get half the tilapia  fish and they steam it and season it to your liking. I personally like the ginger and onion style. Comes with rice, soup, veggies and tea. 

They also have $6 specials with different types of congee and cheung fun.. the one I ordered was pork slices and fried fritter cheung fun (I think that's the English translation for it) 


One thing is they are not really English friendly as most of the good stuff on the  menu are in Chinese, what I did was took pictures of the menu and had my mom read it to me as my Chinese is poor lol....

If you can at least speak Chinese I think you should be fine.."}
{"text":"I love my Rice Rolls and I do think Pot Rice & Rolls House does their rice rolls really well. The texture is smooth and silky. 

I would suggest getting their plain rice rolls. 

At this ridiculously cheap price point, one cannot expect the best ingredients being use. So the meat (beef/pork) used in the congee and rice rolls were not the best.

If you are really on a tight budget, this is the place to get your meals as most of the combos are at $5 tax in! You can be loaded with carbs as the portion sure could fill you up.

Please bring a strong stomach as the condiment bottles are all super sticky and the food court has flies buzzing around."}
