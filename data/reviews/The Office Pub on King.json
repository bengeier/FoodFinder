{"text":"Went at around 8pm with a date just to check it out and get some quick food and shots in before a movie. --  (-3) Terrible, slow, inattentive, and at times, rude service.  (-2) The food was way below average for the price. (The tacos were awful. Like someone threw dry ground meat into a tortilla.) (+1)The drinks, however, were about average price for Toronto. And their special sounded decent.  Overall, I won't ever go back here again (or recommend it) simply based on their service alone."}
{"text":"Had a very nice time here! Despite its low rating, my girlfriend and I were looking for a spot to have a drink and some dinner. Most other bars along king st were far too noisy and crowded for our liking (such as beerbistro and earl) so we settled on this. The server was very nice to us, and got us everything we needed. We ended up ordering the seafood antipasti, wings, and 3 tacos. I was throughly impressed by thier tacos; they had a special where 3 tacos were 9 dollars. We got 1 pork, 1 fish and 1 chicke taco, and all were great. Each had unique toppings, and a different flavour profile, but the most well done was the chicken one in my opinion. The seafood antipasti was also very good, generous portions of mussels, but small amount of calamari and shrimp. They did the mussels right here, very well seasoned and cooked just right. The wings were a disappointment though; they were dry and lacked enough sauce.   The service was prompt, food arrived on time, amd the server made sure every need of ours was met. The manager also came out and said hi, which ia always a plus in my opinion.   Overall this place surprised me, given its reviews. A little overpriced in my opinion, but not a bad place for drinks and barfood after work."}
{"text":"Truly the worst thing I've ever ordered on Hungrhub. Chicken arrived basically unseasoned and next to a similarly unseasoned pile of quinoa. at least it's clean I guess. Will not be doing this again."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times already: once when they just opened and another time last month. And I gotta say that each visit left me quite happy considering the quality and variety of the places in the neighbourhood: you either get an ok place for a steep price or a blah experience for a cheap price. The Office, overall, I thought it was quite a decent place for the price you were facing at the end of your visit.  Well, this vision change after my last visit. Considering that here we are in the downtown core, this place should be busy during lunch hours during the week. Well, it is not. It usually never been but at least there were about 8-10 people. This time there were only 5 because there were 3 of us. The service is certainly good and feels genuine.  What left me disappointed was the sudden change in quality of the food.  I've ordered the lunch deal that for that day consisted in a burger with bacon and cheese and the choice of a side between the usual fries, onion rings and the soup of the day.  The burger was in my opinion clearly from a frozen packaging. Small, rubbery and tasteless, it definitely left me very disappointed knowing that the burgers I had before where of a much better quality. The soup, a butternut squash, didn't impress me either but certainly I found it to be better than the main item that unfortunately, I chose to eat first.  The beer at least was fine and along with the service, my rating would more like to be a 2.5 stars.  I'm not so sure I will go back again.   Sorry :("}
{"text":"One of the worst pub food I've ever had. Ordered four different take out items and they all sucked.  I ordered nachos, tacos, and two different spaghettis."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the bartender knows what he's doing. Drink suggestions are on point and  checks in on a timely manner to ensure everything is ok. Servers have topped up my beer in the past when pitchers are ordered. Will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out for a quick drink Or have a night out with the friends on the weekends. The service is great. If youre a regular they will always take care of you. Fridays and Saturdays are karoke nights at 10, and it can get hilariouuusly fun. Foood is good depending on what you like. Reasonably priced beeer specials! & half price bottles of wine on some nights of the week. Overall great for a chill evening. If youre a go with the flow kinda person who doesnt mind a relaxed environment def drop by!"}
{"text":"Won't even fetch me a cup of water when I'm having a liquor.... not even a single sheet of napkin when the bar is totally empty....... seriously!?"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, very poor service and the restaurant was empty. Food was mediocre, it didn't help that we didn't receive cutlery until halfway through our meal. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Quiet should not be in the description.  This is not anywhere I would recommend to anyone who is in any way sober or wanting a nice calm meal.  I feel awful for the servers who have to work in these unacceptable conditions that likely contravene what is allowed by the Workers Compensation Board.  The owner is clearly disconcerted with the hearing of his employees.  Sad."}
{"text":"On of the worst places for food and service. I checked the ratings on yelp prior to being dragged in, and I'm so upset I couldnt talk my friend out of it. It was the closest place to go that didnt have a wait list to get a table right away. We sat at the bar and had one beer each and some tacos here and it took 45min to get our tiny simple tacos. The bartender was rude and gave us the wrong beers at first and didnt care to take our orders when we were ready until we waved our hands at him. Never going back."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I come here on a regular basis. Great staff and great food. They treat there customers like gold. Highly recommend adding this spot to your list!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about our experience was our cute server.   I ordered grilled salmon with veggies. After a long wait, I got a completely dry cold chicken with a bunch of vegetables. The Brussels sprouts had some sand on them, they didn't bother washing the broccoli either. I was crunching on some things while eating spinach. Pretty gross.   My husband ordered Mediterranean pizza. I have had better frozen ones. It wasn't anything special, the crust wasn't cooked properly. I'm pretty sure it wasn't made freshly.   We had nachos to share. The cheese on nachos was rancid and dry. The nachos weren't crispy. I don't know how they keep up with their business but I believe the location helps to trap some tourists no matter what.   Our server was really nice but the service was slow. I don't think it was because of her though cuz she came to check on us multiple times. We had two descent cocktails although my gimlet was served on a half empty martini glass. I basically paid $13 for 2oz of cocktail.   Our total bill was $90 including the generous tip. I regret that we didn't go to terronis two blocks up where we would pay a similar amount for a way better quality of food and drinks.   They accept credit cards. They offer patio sitting."}
{"text":"We were hosting a company function last week here. We ordered the recommended pitcher deal - one pitcher of beer plus three free apps. Sounds great right? Well the pitcher was $23 and the FREE  apps were $23 as well. Bread $5.  The deal was not on the menu nor a promo card.  Bread price not on the menu. The response to our queries? That is the deal.  We felt like we were taken advantage of at every opportunity.  Stay on the menu or go somewhere else. Don't order the specials.  The food was competent if not average.    It's a shame as we have numerous corporate functions and it's right next to our office.  Fortunately there are many other choices.  The staff were also pretty unhappy with management. Two of the staff complained about inappropriate comments.   It seems so 1970's."}
{"text":"Service was OK. Food came cold. Even though it wasn't busy, took a while for food to arrive. Seems like there is a disconnect between the staffs and customer service."}
{"text":"THEY DIDN'T HONOR WEBSITE WING NIGHT SPECIAL I commuted over half an hour just for the Thursday wing night special: 2lb wings for $14.99 (still on website right now). When I got there the server told me $18.99 for first 2lb wings and $5.99 for subsequent 2lb orders. I was not about to eat 4lb of wings, so I showed him the special on the website. After speaking with the manager, they still would not honor the special as advertised online, saying it had not been updated on the website. My friend and I left before ordering, so I can't comment on the food. But the service? Some of the worst I've encountered. Also not sure of the legal implications of false advertising, but I wouldn't want that hanging over me if I was manager."}
