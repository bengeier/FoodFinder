{"text":"Best authentic tex mex I've had in years! Great prices and service, too. I'm from Texas but live in west virginia and let me tell you it is hard to find mexican food like that!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for an $8 plate of 2 tacos with rice and beans. The meat was a little too salty, as was the rice...but the refried beans were home made, and not out of a can or out of a package. The avocado was fresh in the guacamole--however it was only smashed avocado: no seasoning, no jalapeno, no garlic, onion or tomato. Chips were fresh and hot. My daughter had Maria's special which was a taco, chalupa (tostada), enchilada, tamale and relleno (just some deep fried ground beef and cheese). The sauce on the tamale was cloaento hot dog chili....but the mole on the enchilada was home made. The tostada was perfect.   The service was great...our waitress was very personable and helped me find their hottest sauce--the Diablo sauce. It had a little spice to it. :-)  For someone who comes from New Mexico, this was as close to \"home\" as I have seen yet! Now they just need some red and green chile!!"}
{"text":"Maria's used to be the place my household went to on a weekly basis. We spent a few months away and come back only to be disappointed. My tacos al carbon was rubbery meat in stale flour tortillas. No queso fresco, no onions, no cilantro. The refried beans looked unappealing and still had the tinny taste of the can. My rice was so hard I could have put it in a bag and resold it at the store.  My roommate got a combo of a tostada, beef taco, and a Mexican stew burrito. There was sauce from the burrito everywhere that made everything else a soggy mess. He also said that it had no real flavor.  The bf ordered.the chicken fajita taco salad. Instead he was given a regular chicken taco salad. It was also so soggy that it fell apart on first contact with a fork.  Maria's has also expanded the menu and it doesn't do them any favors. It is the same fare you can find at any hole in the wall and none of it is authentic. Another strike against them is that they are now charging for soda refills. This I could understand if they were doling out individual cans but they aren't. So it now costs 2.25 for your first glass and a dollar every glass after that.  We will no longer be frequenting Maria's."}
{"text":"Yes, this place was kind of lame.  The salsa was unmemorable, and that's a crying shame.  I got a spinch-y burrito of sorts, which was less than amazing... the spinach didn't taste particularly fresh... but at least the whole thing was drenched in cheese - a plus.  Considering the wealth of other Mexican restaurants in town, I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"How could a person from Ohio find and be back to Maria's so many times he wants to write a nice review? That's an interesting story. Let's just say it has something to do with the proximity to the Airport and a friend who runs me over to this place between intentionally scheduled long layovers... so we can see each other for a few minutes and eat here.  I believe I've hit the five meal mark at Marias in the past year... every time tasty. Every time good service... and that hug on New Year's day from our favorite server was just one component of a great getaway. I've taken quite a liking to this place. The food's pretty darned good, the margaritas just what you need before take-off and the staff? Awesome.  It's one of those small family owned places I seek when I want great Mexican food. Kudos to my friend for turning me on to this place - I really love coming here.  PS: DO NOT EXPECT UPSCALE IN ANY WAY. Kick back."}
{"text":"After having been in Charlotte for a year Maria's has become my go to place for Mexican food.  I find myself going back every week or two and its a regular trek since its fast, its friendly and the food is authentic and consistently good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food In Charlotte And Ive Eaten At Alot. Chicken And Cheese Enchildas Rancheras Is Like No Other!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, go here often. The salsa is the best I've ever had. Try the Pollo Mexicano and you will be hooked as well."}
{"text":"Nominal at best. If you like Taco Bell this place is for you.  Granted, I ordered of the combination menu for a quick lunch, but the food was warm-not hot-and could have been unwrapped from a fast food chain and placed on a plate. At least the plates were hot."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was that the dining area was clean. It literally took 20 minutes to get three tacos to go, mind you there was no one in the restaurant. When I asked what was taking so long, I was told that the kitchen staff never got my order. So they had to process the order again and should be done shortly. Disappointed. By the way I got a lemon instead of a lime for my tacos, not cool."}
{"text":"One way you can tell if the food is good is if the actual type of people that eat there are that nationality.  Well here is a place that has great food, really nice waitresses and inexpensive cuisine.  You can get a ton of food under $10 and Chips and salsa galore!  the drink specials are great there too!"}
{"text":"I think proximity to my house is definitely going to make Maria's a go to stop in the future.  After spending waaaaaay to much money at Home Depot a few Saturday's back, we needed a filling and cheap lunch. Saw Marias and decided to give it a try.  The chips and salsa were flowing the entire time. Both of us got the $1.99 beer special. They even brought out cold mugs and limes with it, which was a plus.  The lunch menu is super inexpensive. Everything around $5-6. I got the cheese quesadilla, beans, and rice and my husband got this scrambled egg/bell peppers/onion mixture that came with tortillas, beans, and rice. Everything was pretty good. Not blow your pants off good. But, if you are looking for some typical Mexican restaurant food, this place will do the trick!   Inexpensive, decent tasting, and great location. Winning combo!"}
{"text":"I tried twice before I wrote a review, and have been disappointed both times. They charge for every little thing (1.75 for a side of sour cream). Paid $9 for a taco salad and it only had beans and lettuce. Highly disappointed, would not recommend for any one, especially not vegetarians."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican I've ever had as well as service. If you are a true Mexican food enthusiast DONT GO HERE !"}
{"text":"Quick recap: good drink specials and great service highlight this restaurant. The food is ok at best. The rice and beans were a little salty and some of the food had freezer burn. I do not recommend this place. There are better options.   From the outside the restaurant does not seem well kept but it wasn't too bad inside. Seemed like a typical Mexican restaurant. Nothing seemed dirty or messy.   Service was excellent. The server was quick, kind, and spoke but English and Spanish.   The food unfortunately was disappointing. It started out positive as the chips were warm and the salsa wasn't bad. After that it was all down hill. The enchiladas were not bad, but not great. Pretty average. The rice and beans were a bit salty but not terrible. The chile relleno however, was not edible. One bite and it was a no go. Complete freezer burn ruined the food."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice too. Nice Latin music playing in the background and the service is quick. Check them out."}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke.  No wonder there was a nearly empty restaurant the entire time we were there during dinner hours!  Even with the lack of business, they still managed to mess up our orders.  The icing on the cake was how short and rude the management was to us even though we were being more than friendly during our visit.  My advice is to walk 15 feet over to the Mexican restaurant right next door where they probably appreciate your business a little more."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food and overpriced.   I ordered the chicken with Veggies. The chicken breast was flat and tasteless and the veggies were mostly pepper and onions. I also ordered the guacamole appetizer which was full of onions and was tiny. It costs $4.75 but I only got about a quarter cup of guacamole."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best values in Charlotte. The food is genuine, tasty and well prepared, the waitstaff is super friendly and efficient, and the prices are very reasonable.  My husband and I have been going here regularly for almost 3 years and we still love it. We have lived and worked in 5 different countries including in Europe, Latin America and the US. This place is pretty unique and the top shelf margaritas are better than what you will find elsewhere too.  They also speak Spanish as well as English. If you are Latino/a and feel homesick for your language, or if you are a gringo/a who would like to brush up on your Spanish (or just speak plain old English), while knocking back a few beers or margaritas with some good Mexican food, without breaking your budget, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Maria's is terrific Mexican food. The lunch special prices are great. The drinks here are great, too. Make sure you get a margarita and some enchiladas. Tacos are fresh. We've even had Maria's delivered and they give you a lot of food. It's a great place to go for lunch or dinner, and one of, if not the, best Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. It's on a busy South Boulevard and not a very big place, but it's worth a meal or five."}
{"text":"Simple, very low key Mexican. I am a fan of the chicken enchiladas. Ask for the homemade hot sauce."}
{"text":"I've been driving past Maria's for years. Like, seriously...YEARS. And I want to kick myself for not giving them a try sooner.   I'm not going to lie, I judged them based on their appearance but this place is a real hidden jewel for Charlotte. Learn from me - some of the BEST places might not look that great on the outside.Try them anyway - you might be pleasantly surprised!    My friend and I stopped in for lunch and margaritas. I ordered a strawberry margarita and it was nice and strong! Not to mention, our waitress brought us the extra margarita because she didn't want it to go to waste. That's what I call top notch service. It's the little extras that add up to an overall really great experience.   For lunch, I ordered the chimichangas which comes with rice and all the toppings. First, they won me over because you get TWO chimichangas. Second the food was hot and fresh. It was absolutely delicious. Crispy fried goodness with a lot of filling.I was soooo full when I left.    I really enjoyed the food! I And the service was great too. I will absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"In a city with so many great options for Mexican, this was a major letdown. For the price, portions were small and my special request of no tomatoes was not followed. There was a confrontation between staff and another customer while I was there regarding an incorrect order that turned into a shouting match.  This was a poor experience and I will not return."}
{"text":"Delicious and just right amount for lunch. The service was speedy and efficient. I couldn't believe how inexpensive it was!! The restaurant was very clean, neat and brightly lit.  I definitely intend to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Formerly El Cancun, Maria's Mexican Restaurant is worth the trip to the corner of South & Tyvola.    The chips came out nice and warm and I don't know anywhere else you can get two ground beef tacos with a side of beans and rice for $7 that tastes like homemade Mexican cooking.  The sopapilla dessert for a little over $1, a quick little bite, is a perfect ending.  This place also seems popular with \"boys\" if you know what I mean.  They always find the cool places first!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a low thrills meal at a great price from friendly people. I have been here a few times with my wife to grab a quick and simple lunch and have never had a bill over $20 with drinks. We always take advantage of the cheap ($1 - $2) Mexican beer specials which they serve to you with a chilled glass. Normally not a fan of this practice, but with certain beers and a certain atmosphere, it seems very fitting. Menu is what you would expect, but with more options than most. Great value and several good experiences will have me coming back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. A friend of mine took me here a year ago, with a promise of the best sweet tea I've ever had in a restaurant. This wound up being 90% true. lol All in all, nice staff that isn't annoying. They explain the menu pretty well, and don't rush you through your meal. I try something different every time I go (every 2 months or so), and haven't had a bad meal yet. I try and bring a new friend every time I go, and they all go back, even without me. So yeah. lol Good food, fast service, comfortable space, EXTREMELY REASONABLE PRICES. It's right next door to Punta Cana, and I've had both, I prefer Maria's."}
{"text":"How to find a good Mexican restaurant: Looks like the building used to be something else. Check. Has tasty margaritas, Check. Has a staff that speaks Spanish first, English second, Check. Food is tastily prepared (and if you come often enough you'll notice subtle variations in each batch of sauce). Check. Chips taste freshly made (with fresh oil). Check. Salsa is spicier than chain restaurants? Check.   I've been here dozens of times, so many that one particular waitress gives us big hugs. even though I live in Ohio, I make effort to come to Maria's each time I'm in Charlotte. My meals are always great, I don't have to ask for Vegetarian beans because they don't use lard in theirs at all, my food and my friend's always comes out well presented (and it doesn't take long before the plate is empty).  BURP. Make it to Maria's..."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Friendly, family oriented service.  Consistent.  Enchiladas Suizas are awesome.  My husband loves the Burrito Bravo also.  Endless chips and salsa.  Huge portions.  Authentic.  Super economical.  Best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"An amazing value!  If you want delicious, cheap Mexican food, this is the place for you!  The waitstaff is always friendly!  The Mexican rice is the best in town!  I regularly crave their tacos"}
{"text":"Clean, solid restaurant.  Previous reviews had me skeptical about eating here , but a random conversation about favorite restaurants with people we met at Flying Biscuit pushed me over the edge.  To clear things up, this place is not nasty at all.  Its nicer than I remember it which says a lot for an old building at the corner of South B and Tyvola.  Very friendly and happy to be there staff.  The chips were ok, could have been better, salsa was fine.  My wife is the cheese dip queen and it passed her standards.  What I liked most about this place was that the menu had both more traditional dishes and a large Tex-Mex combos section as well.  I had carnitas while my wife had the 2 enchilada 1 taco combo.  So I got to try both worlds (even though I lean towards the traditional I got love for a cheese enchilada!).  My carnitas were flavorful and well cooked.  The meat had a little more fat than I liked, but I simply picked around it.  And I'm sure that the fat is where the flavor came from.  The meat was served covered with grilled onions that enhanced the flavor further.  The chicken taco from the combination dinner was really good - the chicken was shredded and juicy.  Cheese and chicken enchiladas were both solid.  I won't be bringing my parents or banker here, but my wife and I will be back soon.  Next time I will be getting the chilequilles."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. Elaine and Maria are great and give u a hug and kiss when you walk in. I love their burrito bravo with chicken and shrimp and the carnitas are amazing as well. Great prices with lots of lunch specials even on the weekends"}
{"text":"Maria's is the best Mexican food in Charlotte! I have never ordered anything that I did not like and the staff is so sweet. Next time you are craving chips and queso you have to stop by Maria's!"}
{"text":"Ahh finally a small AUTHENTIC Mexican spot! Its not the best Mexican I had, but its authentic and pretty decent.  Free fresh trips and salsa riight when you get in and if you speak spanish the waitress will joke with you.  The best part about this place is the price! I think for a beer and an entree it was like $9.  There a ton of options for anyone. Its a small quiet place with nothing to exciting in terms of decorating, but dont worry about that.  Good food, awesome price, and fast service. Definitely try it"}
{"text":"Cheap and fast...great for my wallet and quick gratification for my rumbly tummy!   They have a menu online for the quick order-to-go. The food is good and of large portion.   I'll have to try dining in next time and update the eating in experience. Until then, it'll be my reliable, solid \"to go\" Mexican food spot."}
{"text":"Take most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt - our first visit to Maria's today was all good - very pleasant, clean room, nice welcome, pleasant servers. Very extensive menu, including mole in a couple of dishes. And endless options - can get just about anything a la carte, if you don't want the rice & beans. But both the rice and beans are more flavorful than any I've had at other Mexican places, so you may want to stick with them. The horchata is good, as someone else said. We'll definitely return and try other items."}
{"text":"When looking for a Mexican spot, you will not go wrong picking Maria's over the rest...  Lunch Specials are truly special. They combine great taste to a price so low that it does not match... On average a lunch special would go for $6 (usually under!). Order some water and you are well under an average price lunch outing.  If you are feeling like eating mexican and your around the area... Visit Maria's and i'm pretty sure you'll leave with a belly full smile.  Buen Aprovecho! (Enjoy!)"}
{"text":"I have to say that after reading a few reviews of Maria's I was interested in tasting their food. The general consensus is just about on the money. From my experience, I am going to have to rate Maria's as average.      The Atmosphere -- After reading a previous critic review, I can see that it indeed, was formerly an Arthur Treachers, lamp post signage and all. Walking in, you're greeted with bright colors, and faux leather lined booths. I have to say, as a word of warning, be careful not to sit too fast, as the benches are a bit soggy and you'll drop with a thump onto the wood below.      The Menu -- The one thing that I can really note about this menu is that it's big. Really big. There's a lot on it, with all of the food that non-spanish people have come to expect from Mexican food. Everything involves cheese, sour cream, or some kind of sauce. Not that it's bad, in fact it's exactly what most people have come to expect from Mexican."}
{"text":"Great service!  If you are a fan of VERY low-key Mexican food, this should hit the spot. Greasy spoon Mexican restaurant at the intersection of South Blvd and Tyvola Rd, it is a bit difficult to get in and out of the parking lot. I have never been there when it is crowded for lunch. I can usually get in, eat and pay within 20 minutes. Seriously, they are that fast, which is good if you are on a time crunch.  I've tried mostly vegetarian dishes and they are all tasty and just what you want from a small Mexican lunch place. Cheesy, no skimping on the beans and fresh cut avocado for a very small charge by request."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! The service was fast and the staff was very friendly! The food was hot and had lots of flavor!! Will definitely go back! The Huevos rancheros was great!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Very authentic!  Burrito bravo is the most recommended but honestly everything is just good!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place a few weeks ago for the first time with my bestfriend. First let me say I can be a little spoiled when it comes to Mexican food because I lived in Virginia beach growing up and there were 2 authentic Mexican restaurants I always went to..so I look for the real deal...and hold Mexican food places to HIGH standards! But anywho...I was excited to come here but the food was mediocre. It was good but not as good as I would hope. It lacked flavor, which was disappointing. I didn't totally hate it by any means but it wouldn't be my number one choice if I was in the mood for good Mexican food. The staff was great! Also it was pretty pricy which wouldn't have been an issue if the food tasted better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Mexican food in Charlotte! Very unassuming, no-frills place -- just like I like! As others have said, don't be put off by the outside. In fact, most of my most disappointing Mexican meals have been at the \"prettier\" spots.  The Margaritas are very tasty -- much less bottled mix-y than many. Chips are fresh and the salsa has a little more heat than most, which to me taste more like spiced ketchup. (At other places I usually have to ask if they have a \"salsa picosa\") And the food -- always delicious!"}
{"text":"Maria's is where I go when I want some good cheap traditional Mexican food! It is a great place that always has good service and is owned and operated by Maria who is super nice.... really good food and daily drink specials!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Staff is shy but very nice. Don't go unless you get the Pollo Mexicano. Delish."}
{"text":"Cheap & easy. We go here for lots of fresh tacos fast! Endless salsa and nice staff, nothing fancy but it's good...."}
{"text":"The tilapia is very flavorful and the dish is beautiful. The Jardin vegetarian plate is delish as well"}
{"text":"While I am still fairly new to the Mexican food scene I have to say Marias is some of the best I have had.   I went during a lunch rush on a Friday. I have to disagree with Julia S. in saying it is packing with gringos. My friend and I were the extreme minority in this case. For the first time I felt embarrassed that I didn't speak Spanish, because every other patron in the restaurant did.  That being said, had an enchilada, burrito, some tacos, and everything was incredible. Tasted very fresh, chips were good, but the salsa did leave something to be desired.   Can't wait to return and try some other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is overhyped. The food was just okay and they got my very basic order of \"enchiladas with no beans\" wrong. It was also expensive! Our bill for 2 people with no drinks was $40 with tip. I would rather go to a nice restaurant for that price. My recommendation would be to skip this place and go to Miguel's instead!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  It's a total hole in the wall but has some of the best Mexican food in Charlotte.  Same staff are always working including the owner.  Delicious tacos, cheese dip, burritos, soup, and homemade salsa.  I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like.  I like spicy food so it doesn't bother me but be advised that their complimentary salsa is spicy and so is their cheese dip.  My dad frequently gets the spinach quesadilla.  They have great inexpensive lunch specials everyday.  I know on Tuesdays they have chicken fajita lunch specials for 5.99.  Friendly wait staff.  They always greet me with a hug. Don't expect any dance decor but do expect great service and amazing Mexican food.  If you're ever looking for something different from your typical order, try their chicken soup.  I gave them four stars instead of five because the inside is so dingy and the bathroom could use some serious work.  Five stars for the food!"}
{"text":"I will never eat at another Mexican restaurant again because Maria's is the best. Chips and salsa are akin to my favorite Texas Mexican joint, cheese enchiladas with the best creamy cheese and rice and refined beans just like my childhood best friends mom used to make back in Texas. Everything g else in Charlotte is worthless, this is the place to be for casual and inexpensive Mexican fare. Stellar service and very clean. I cannot wait to return.   My Russian husband is not a fan of Mexican food, but he continues to dine here regularly, because he's never had anything as delicious as this!!!! Win win"}
{"text":"Don't be mislead but the unattractive exterior of this place.  It's a solid stop for Mexican food.  I've been here a few times and really can't say a bad thing about it other than it's a bit tough to get in and out of from the parking lot since it is situation at a light on a rather busy South Boulevard.  The service is always good and they have solid menu choices.  The whole place is very similar to any other middle of the road Mexican joint you've been to.  My suggestion is go in without any real high expectations and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"The salsa taste like V8 tomato juice yuck! They charge for extra chips and salsa not unlimited like most Mexican restaurants, so no worries here of me wanting extra salsa. Really nice people with fast service. Food is delicious I ordered a beef burrito and cheese enchilada with rice yummy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites for cheap, fast and tasty Mexican! It's definitely low-key and casual, but for a scrumptious chimichanga with terrific queso and a heavy-on-the-tequila margarita, this place has it all!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place I'm Charlotte. I love the choripollo and the salsa is great."}
{"text":"We go to this place all the time great food and service. Cheap and good food....always bring our daughter a lollipop everytime and she knows it. They also walk her around and they do this with alot of regulars children....Try the Texan Burrito!"}
{"text":"Best enchiladas I have found in clt.  Good price point.  Decent service.  I go at least once week.  Can't find a better Mexican place than this one."}
{"text":"Only place in Charlotte that I can get my shrimp chimichanga. Always friendly and great service."}
{"text":"I LOVE Maria's! It is a no-frills place, but the food is so good. It's also more authentic than you can get in most places around Charlotte. Food always comes out quickly, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican restaurant I have found in Charlotte.  The food is consistently good, the prices are reasonable and the service is good.  You should give it a try.  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Well it's date night. Of course i'm exhausted!! My Fiance and I have visited before. The Location is easy to find. Everyone here is super friendly and quick. It's Never crowded here, you're  always guaranteed a seat.   Considering I've had a REALLY long day, of coures I started with a classic Margarita (medium size) The drink menu includes the  Prices. I love the Margaritas here, you certainly get your moneys worth.  Once again I  ordered the Steak Quesadilla (you get 2) Amazing! This is my personal favorite dish, comes with a slice of tomatoe, iceberg lettuce and sour cream.....needless to say I didnt use any of the added toppings lol. We ordered Guacamole (small order) it was literally OKAY. Overall i look forward to having many more quesadillas here lol."}
{"text":"Best Margirita & Service in Charlotte! Fresh Fresh Fresh Food at Great Prices~"}
{"text":"Used to love everything at Maria's - especially the beans and rice and the spinach quesadilla. So delicious!!!! Everyone I brought there agreed it was some of the tastiest Mexican food they'd ever had - well worth the less than convenient location.   Then one day they changed the ingredients. The cheese tasted plastic-y and fake, the spinach didn't taste fresh, the beans and rice lost their flavor.   It's clear that they've cut corners over the years. I'm sure they're trying their best to survive, but the food they once served - about 5 years ago - was so unbelievably good, I would make special trips way out there (25 minutes away) weekly. I hope they will return to the better ingredients they once used.   The staff is always pleasant and the prices are great. The beans and rice aren't as good as they once were, but still some of the best around."}
{"text":"I travel all over for my job, so I have tried it all, this was horrible.  The salsa has no flavor and the chips taste like oil.  I ordered the burrito rojo, the meat was cold, dry, and flavorless and the tortilla was even cold.  The beans seem to be out of a can and the rice had no flavor.  I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Dont let the outside of the building deter you.  The food here was so good. We came in and were immediately greeted, warm chips and salsa was bought to the table. We then ordered the guacamole. DELICIOUS! They made sure or chips were never empty and they were warm and crispy everytime they came out. Of course we had to order margaritas!!! ordered the large and she gave us the extra that was left over. Nice little surprise! WINNING! I ordered the fajita nachos and my friend ordered the chimichunga. We both cleaned our plates. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Monday.  The place was mostly empty, booths in disrepair, the walls and floor look grimy and the lady that sat us wasn't friendly.  Then our waitress was even less friendly.  No smile, no welcome, just not a reasonable welcome to paying customers.  Then the salsa = good grief it was like hot sauce in a cup!!  I asked for \"gringo\" salsa and it was basically tomato sauce with onions in a cup = neither of these options worked for me so I wasn't able to enjoy the chips & salsa like I usually do at a mexican restaurant  :-(  The chicken fajitas were alright, nothing to write home about, but certainly passable.  There wasn't anything at Maria's that I'd return for, and that's a shame  :-("}
{"text":"Not a taqueria but more of a real sit down restaurant which usually means ungodly portions. Maria did not disappoint. I ordered the choripollo which is chicken breasts covered in chorizo covered in cream. When I asked the waitress whether to get that or a more expensive shrimp dish, with no hesitation she said choripollo.  It was decadently rich and think and unfortunately a bit too salty and I'm pretty ok with a pretty large amount of salt. Still when you need some real stick to your ribs mexican food in Charlotte, Maria's has been my favorite so far."}
{"text":"We came here with another couple who are regulars at this location. We had great service from the beginning to the end. I was surprised at how slow they were for a friday night.   Chips and salsa were good. We ordered the guacamole and it was a little bland for my taste.  I got the combo-taco, burrito and rice and beans and really enjoyed it My husband got the chicken fajitas and he liked it a lot.   Overall, the experience was good. It is kind of a hike from our location but we would definitely consider coming back!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this Starmount corridor is loaded with all kinds of hole in the wall gems.   I could easily sit here and eat their chips, salsa, and cheese dip all day.  There's a lunch specials menu available every day, Monday-Friday 11am-3pm, Saturday & Sunday noon-3pm. They range in price from $3.99-$8.95. My latest trip here I got lunch #2 (burrito and taco, $5.50). I did beef for the burrito and chicken for the taco. Both were good. I also ordered a chile relleno. Their take on it is a deep fried ball of dough filled with ground beef. It was okay, but I wouldn't order that again.  It's not fancy. It's kind of divey, but don't let the appearance fool you. The food is good and fairly inexpensive. Worth a trip if you're in this area and craving some Mexican eats."}
{"text":"The food here was very good, albeit FILLING. It was nice to have a number of vegetarian options to choose from. I thought the salsa was very good. It was spicy but I like spicy.   Beers were $2.50 - a soda was $2. I would pick a beer over a soda any day anyway - but being frugal as I am, how could I possibly say no!   I ate so much I thought I might be sick - but it was my fault, and not the food. No one forced me to clean my plate but I did anyway; a testament to how much I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This spot offers very friendly service... I was craving shredded chicken and theirs was awesome. Very well seasoned and juicy... I will be back..."}
{"text":"Gross gross gross ..I honestly don't see how people eat here...I guess of you're a fan of Taco Bell, maybe. Fajitas were all onions and my chicken was so over cooked and tough..very unappetizing. The salsa was just stewed tomatoes thrown in a blender...the Pico de Gallo lacked any flavor and the margaritas tasted like all sour mix....I will NEVER step foot in that place again."}
{"text":"Cheap, yes. But nasty. Dull flavors, beyond cheap ingredients. There's veg fare to be gotten here, but so much better on almost every other corner in this part of town.  Kind of amazing to me that even tho they're smack dab in the middle of Burrito Way that they continue to do business - hit Maria's around lunchtime and you'll find the explanation: mostly gringos, slurping up the watered down salsa, ordering the 5 dollar lunch special and leaving 1 dollar tips.   No, gracias."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've had in Charlotte. We got the nachos and the burrito Texano and they did not disappoint. Quick delivery and reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good food and nice ambience.  Small but neat and clean.  Reasonably priced.  Quantity could've a bit more."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid with my family and I love it just as much 20 years later. The staff is friendly, greets me by name and asks about my family, remembers my order and serves it FAST and almost always accurately. I see the same faces there year after year and can't believe there isn't a wait here ever."}
{"text":"After reading a recent review, and not having been to Maria's in years, I had to check it out. Upon arrival, we were greeted, seated, and served chips and salsa immediately. The chips were fresh & warm, however the salsa was a little runny, as was the guacamole a little creamy, for my liking. However, the fajitas, and combo meals we ordered were fresh, warm, and delivered quickly. The service was great and everyone is very friendly...and the prices are awesome. I will be back."}
{"text":"One of the usual South Boulevard (aka Burrito Way) Mexican restaurants, Maria's is at the corner near Tyvola. Popping in after lunch, it was quiet. Chips and salsa, as usual.  I had the enchilada and taco combo, which with a drink was less than $10. It was decent and flavorful. And no different than any other Mexican restaurant north or south by a mile or two."}
{"text":"Maria's is a great family restaurant with friendly employees who make you feel right at home.  My daughter and I tried Maria's a couple of months ago and we've been going every week since.  You quickly build a friendship with the staff and they are always happy to see us and give my daughter a big hug.  We felt like family.  The food is great especially for the price.  I suggest the burrito texano with the shredded beef.  The flavor in the shredded beef is incredible!  My daughter loves the kids steak burrito with rice. Maria's is amazing!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer -- I am very picky about my mole. Was craving mole so I thought I'd give Maria's a try. Ordered the enchilladas ranchero which is drizzled in mole. It was ok. The refried beans were excellent and so too was the salsa. The menu did look wonderful though so I will be back."}
{"text":"I have friends who come here regularly so I thought I'd give it a try.  But I left very disappointed.  I should have read Julia's review prior to going because that is exactly how I felt about this place.  This place is a hole in the wall.  Its access is difficult due to the proximity to Tyvola road.  It looks like this place is in an old Arthur Treacher's restaurant.    Like most mexican places,  the standard chips and salsa arrived upon entering.  The chips were crisp and unsalted.  The salsa was ok...nothing exceptional.  The pico arrived later in my meal and it was tasteless except for a little spice.  The tomatoes looked like they were once frozen.  The service was decent except for My server recommending a burrito saying ti was really good.   Well that's where she was wrong.   The burrito was huge and smothered with queso.  It was the only thing on the plate and it was completely unappetizing.  It was filled with chunks of chicken, grilled peppers and onions and rice and beans. The was no real flavor to this and the primary flavor in this dish was the smothering queso.    It would have been nice if there was some color to the plate.   Sorry, but service alone isn't enough to save this from a 2 star review."}
