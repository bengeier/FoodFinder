{"text":"What a great find! The reviews are not wrong, these pizzas are delicious! I have ordered here twice, picking up both times. Staff were friendly and pizzas were hot and exactly what I was expecting. Give the wings a miss, they aren't anything special."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic.  Other menu items like wings are not worth having.   Great 2 for 1 prices."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizzas from a family joint. All that we've had are delicious. The garden, tahiti, mediterranean are good. Very flavourful and what's better than one pizza? Two pizzas!! as it's always but one get one free lol. It's not really free as it is priced for two but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Years ago when I lived in Calgary, we always used to enjoy the thin crust \"Big Boss\" from Gondola. This is a 15\" square cut pizza. (I recently learned that this is actually \"Chicago tavern-style.\") Our local Gondola discontinued it years ago, and I was afraid that I might never get it again. On this trip to Calgary, I discovered this place which still makes it!   By the way, every Gondola is not the same;  they have different menus.   Thanks for this blast from the past.   Be warned, it is a takeout and delivery shop only, no seating."}
{"text":"Granted, I'm pretty picky when it comes to pizza. This place ranks between the levels of  \"I would eat it\" to \"I would request any other pizza place\".   When so many options for pizza are available, id rather roll the dice and try a new spot, (or an old favourite), rather than revisit this one by choice again soon."}
{"text":"This place was ok, not bad, middling.  But considering that a decent pizza came out of a crappy little hole-in-the-wall strip mall, I'd almost say it was pretty good. Crust - get the thick, which is really just normal thickness. My friend said don't get the thin. I found the crust to be 4*, good crunch but still soft and had a hint of sweet flavour. Sauce - 2*, but I'm picky. I found the sauce to be too sweet and not much flavour. It's needs a kick of some kind. Toppings - 3.5*. You always get 2-for-1 here, and we got a Mexican and Pepperoni. The Mexican has lots of good quality toppings and was flavourful. The Pep was pretty bland.  Cheese - 3*. Not cheap, but not high end either. Some flavour and some gooiness. Price - 3.5*. The 2-for-1 deal makes it decent priced but it wasn't really cheap or anything. So, based on that math, C-to-C gets 3 stars, maybe even 3.5. We would likely order from here again."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop pizza joint. I really enjoy their thin crust pizzas. The crust is never soggy and the toppings are always the perfect amount. My usual order is the ham and pineapple and the garden vegetable with added chicken. The price is 2 for 1 and they also deliver.  This place is always busy; there's always people from the neighborhood walking there to pick up the pizza. I've brought this pizza to some potlucks and its always been a hit."}
{"text":"When I moved to Brentwood a year ago, I loved having this independent pizza place around the corner. The pizza was good and a good price.  Until I got an awful bout of food poisoning from them.   I'm not going back."}
{"text":"These guys have probably the best thin crust pizza in town gondola has been around for years and years and this is one of the few places in the city left that still serves that style of thin crust.. There's nowhere else in the city I would get my thin crust pizza from.. When it comes to the other Pizza the regular thick crust it's not my particular style but it is good just the same as well so if you're looking for some pizza and you're in the area and you like thin crust I would definitely give them a try"}
