{"text":"Don't know what I ordered here but it was dirt cheap. Probably less than $3.  You get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy. There's an 80% chance that Sam could be serving you. Say hi."}
{"text":"Good food. Inexpensive. The breakfast special is worth the price as the portions are fairly large. The restaurant was crowded upon arrival, but the service was fast and we never saw the bottoms of our cups since the waitstaff was quick about refills."}
{"text":"I ordered the enchiladas, which is my favorite thing to order when it comes to Mexican food. I ate everything on my plate but I wouldn't say they were the best I've had. This was my first visit here and wasn't impressed by the atmosphere. Being at the Biltmore my expectations were higher. It was a bit dull and very dusty, as far as the walls go. I'd say overall this place was just ok. I'm in no hurry to go back. Maybe the original location, downtown, would be better."}
{"text":"Sam's caf√© is not a restaurant but a country meeting place in the middle of Champaign, IL  The food is fine and if you want something alittle out of the ordinary try their French toast....it's the best.  But that's not why you go there.  You walk in and sit down at a table the rocks.....your with people of all walks of life discussing the days events openly.  Sam is at the grill solving problems and every body kicks in.  When you leave Sam's.....you are definitely more enlightened than when you went in.  Sam's is a club and a reminder of days gone by when simplicity was the norm.  Sorry....no latte's at Sam's.  I love the place!"}
{"text":"So I am from Phoenix, AZ, but recently visited Champaign with the boyfriend for the holidays.  I have been hearing about Sam's breakfast, in particular the french toast, for months now.  I love french toast, it is my favorite breakfast food.  I wasn't expecting much, thinking that it was sure to be less fantastic than my boyfriend claimed it to be.  Sam's is the epitome of a greasy spoon.   No frills decor, you walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom and your table is likely to be wobbly.  The server took care of us but was busy with other tables so the service was polite and attentive but short and sweet.  We each ordered a breakfast special and then split an order of french toast.  The breakfast special items (eggs, meat, toast, hashbrowns) were basic but good.  The french toast?  Ridiculous.  Seriously, the best french toast I've ever had.  The cook dips the bread in thinned out pancake batter and then fries it up.  It is rich, crispy and seasoned with powdered sugar and cinnamon.  It was a tasty breakfast on a cold, rainy day.  When the Illini basketball team walked in the door, my boyfriend was in heaven.    At the end of the meal we realized that we didn't have any cash and Sam's doesn't take cards.  Because my boyfriend was a regular in his college days, Gus, the owner, was nice enough to let us leave, get some cash and come back to pay.  Our total was about as pleasing as the french toast.  12 bucks and change for two coffees, two specials and french toast.  Crazy cheap.  Sam's is far away from home, but we'll visit everytime we're in Champaign."}
{"text":"As far as I know, this is the only place to get good Levantine food in town! I am reviewing the Cafe's Thursday-night transformation into a Lebanese restaurant, as it never seems to be open when I have thought about trying their regular stuff. But who cares about that? The food is phenomenal! I get the garlic chicken almost every time because it's so good, but seriously everything is wonderful. It's so cute because they serve it on the same crappy styrofoam plates that you'd expect a crumby diner to serve you a greasy burger on, but the Lebanese cuisine is of a quality that could (and IMHO should!) be served at a way fancier place for way more money.  What a cool place. Seriously. It's one of C-U's little gems."}
{"text":"This is the breakfast place of my dreams!  Two people, breakfast, less than $10.00!  I know, it's not fancy.  They don't have smoothies or espresso like La Peep, they don't have stuffed pancakes like Ihop, and they don't pretend they're something they're not, like others.  However, the food was really good, the coffee drinkable and the service friendly.  Now if it would only move toward Urbana..."}
{"text":"Stopped through champaign on our way back to Iowa from Indiana.  Whole family had breakfast.  Every item ordered rocked!  French toast was unlike any I've eaten... Was simply amazing!"}
{"text":"The perfect inexpensive diner experience - even though it's a small place, we have been there several times and have never had to wait to sit (including a weekend morning). Don't get me wrong, there's always people there, just always seems to be a table ready!  We are not big eaters so we get a half order of French toast, breakfast special, and a side of grits - and split that all between us and our 1 year old daughter. French toast is unique and excellent, and the breakfast special is exactly what it is supposed to be - eggs, sausage (or bacon), toast, American potatoes, and coffee, and prepared how you like it.  Everything including a milk for the daughter is $20 with tip.    Service is awesome - everyone is super-friendly.  1/2 star reserved for the inconvenience of not accepting credit/debit cards - that would make this place 5 stars! For now, make sure you keep an Andrew Jackson on ya!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in Champaign - as good as it gets! They close in mid afternoon, so only serve breakfast and lunch options. They only accept cash as well so keep this in mind if planning to eat here.  Many items have a unique twist to them here. Gus's Famous French Toast is french toast dipped in pancake batter (at least that's what it appears like) and is unique and amazing. The price is quite low as well. Two people can eat breakfast well for under $10 per person with tip and drinks.  The portions are also very large and they offer a full size item or half stack (hash browns, french toast, pancakes, etc.). Their hash browns are called American fries and also have an original twist to them!  Sam's Cafe also has a old fashioned diner feel to it. Local businesses are advertised on the ceiling and it has a real 'local' feel to it. Strongly recommend Sam's Cafe!"}
{"text":"I just got back from here and first off, we waited for over an hour for our food. The people who had come in and ordered way after us were served first, which was rude. Second, I heard them talking about being out of biscuits and gravy about 20 minutes before they actually told us they were. Granted, they did take 30% off after we said something, but the food wasn't even that impressive. I'm definitely never going back."}
{"text":"Every time I walk into Sam's I feel at home. I waddle up to the bar, sometimes hungover, and order the special with coffee and pancakes, and sit there patiently watching Sam do his thing while listening to the soft hum of all the people around me. The food isn't anything you'd find at a Bacarro or a Radio Maria, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It's cash only, which was an adjustment for me to make but it was one I did happily. Sam's is easily one of my favorite places in town, maybe not for the food alone but for the space as well. I hope it never closes."}
{"text":"I see a lot of reviews saying it was dirty, I didn't think it was dirty at all, just an older building. Food was well priced, nothing fancy just good ol home style breakfast. I got the biscuits and gravy it was only $5 and it was 4 of the fluffiest biscuits I've ever eaten and they were not shy with the gravy. Overall very delicious and excellent service, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Sam's Cafe has great food at a reasonable price. I have eaten there many of times and am always satisfied. There famous French toast is my go to, must have breakfast meal. They have great lunch specials with a great at home feeling atmosphere.  The only downside is that the seating is very small. They have a good amount of tables but they are tiny."}
{"text":"This is a true landmark in our town. I had no idea that Sam's Cafe, located in the heart of downtown Champaign, has been here over 30 years. The owner herself was behind the counter cooking breakfast for me and the other patrons.  It was a great experience! The staff was friendly and patient, yet buisey taking and filling orders.  They serve delicious breakfast favorites like bacon and eggs, french toast, and pancakes. They also serve sandwiches and other nonbreakfast foods. I had the biscuts and gravy. Best biscuts and gravy in Champaign! They were incredibly! I also liked that their hashbrowns were not mushy like certain other places have been. But besides the excellent food, its the fact that  I was treated with respect by this establishment! They listened to what I wanted and made my food how I wanted. It was such a great meal and more than a meal an experience! This buisiness took a little time and effort to make something ordinary extordinary! They did this simply by showing respect and listening. Thankyou Sam's!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the place seems to be busy every time I visit. Have always gotten breakfast, and the food has been wonderful every time. I recommend Sam's Cafe!"}
{"text":"Great place for morning birds! Parking is free till 8 AM and you can just grab a counter seat and chill."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  This is a review of Sam's Cafe's new evening menu.  In recent months, Sam's, which appears to be a typical greasy-spoon coffee-and-eggs place during the day, has begun serving delicious Lebanese food on Thursday and Friday evenings.  My husband and I came with two other friends, with whom we seldom agree on where to eat.  I was curious about this place, but wasn't holding out extremely high hopes, since one of my dining companions is from the Middle East and has sky-high standards for Middle Eastern cuisine.  All these problems melted away, however, when we tried Sam's.  Even my Middle Eastern friend was impressed.    Service is quite friendly and lightning fast, and although the menu is limited, everything is delicious!  All the entrees are very reasonably priced and include such classics as falafel, kafte, hummus, and tabbouleh (which was especially delicious!).  All the dinners come with a choice of two side dishes (hummus, Greek salad, or tabbouleh).  The baklava is the best I've ever had.    One caveat:  They do not accept credit cards, so make sure you have cash on hand.  Not knowing this caused my husband to make an emergency ATM run, but the baklava was waiting for him when he returned, so all was well.  I'm thrilled that we found this place; it is a treasure!  My friends and I will now never have to argue about where to go out to eat, and that is amazing in and of itself."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but not outstanding. There's outdoor seating, but it's along the mall's 2nd-story walkway.  One standout:  The individual tamale-style chocolates are a definite upgrade from most restaurants'  \"here's your check\" treat."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm not a fan of this place. They are always under-staffed when I go there and the service they provide reflects that. Don't even try to go in on a weekend. The food is ok but I guess in all fairness the quality does match the lower prices. I would rather them raise their prices and focus on putting more staff on the floor and increasing the quality of food because those are the two main reasons why I will probably not be returning unless the cries of desperation for breakfast suddenly call when I'm nearby."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the BEST place to eat breakfast anywhere in the world.  Do not leave Sam's without trying the pancakes. Even if you don't care for pancakes, you will explode in flavorful bliss when you try them. Sounds a little creepy, but it's true."}
{"text":"First time at Sam's Cafe today and it was one of the best \"traditional\" breakfasts I have had in a while. Dos: Don't miss out on the French toast. Or be like me and double up with the pancakes. Bring cash - they do not accept credit cards.  Dont: Find a seat when you get there, as no will one will seat you.  All in all, it was a great experience, especially for a non-boozy brunch. With its location downtown, you're either doing street parking or in one of the lots."}
{"text":"Good Lebanese food on Thursday and Friday nights. I went with a couple of friends for a B.day party, and decided to share all their entree's to get a feel of all the food. The cafe itself is nothing to brag about, just a small, non-elegant, bread-and-butter diner type of place. The food was good though. They had four items on their dinner menu, each being either $7 or $7.50, including tax: 1. Shish Taok. Small chicken breast pieces, fried in a garlic sauce. recommended.  2. Kibbe. I don't recommend it. A mixture of some sort and then fried, tasted strange. 3. Kafta. Their main beef meal. By far the best food they had. Very tasty. 4. Falafel. It was ok. nothing to brag about.   They had a special meal that night, for $12, which had fried rice and cooked chicken. It was ok.  Each meal comes with a choice of two meals. We all got homous, and tabolli, both of them being delicious. In fact, I think the homous was their best food! Btw, warm pita bread keeps coming, which was a nice touch.  There are three Lebanese ladies who do the whole Lebanese dinner thing (Sam's cafe doesn't cater dinners on any other night other than the mentioned two). They were friendly and nice people."}
{"text":"So my sister was in town for a visit.  She and her hubby live in Monterey, CA, and she decided that she needed to THAW from 50 degree weather!  We were meeting our friend Kelly for dinner, and she suggested Sam's Cafe.  I've been to the one downtown, and really enjoyed it, so I was looking forward to checking out this location.  First of all, the chips and salsa ROCK.  The chips are freshly made, and the salsa is this chunky, chipotle-infused bowl of heaven.  I got the fish tacos -- they were fantastic.  A filet of blackened tilapia, slaw mix, pico, and this chipotle sauce.  Would absolutely recommend this to anybody that likes fish tacos -- sooooo good!  Kelly got the carnitas platter and my sister got the chopped salad.  I didn't try either of their dinner, but they both enjoyed theirs.  Our server was excellent -- she was attentive, without being annoying, and kept our glasses of iced tea full -- which was a good thing after being at the pool most of the day.  To sum it up -- good food, good service, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Much ado about nothing.  Have heard so much about Sam's Cafe and now wonder why.  Upon entering, the first (and lasting) impression was that it was dirty.  Okay, in my Harley riding days, I've eaten at many greasy spoons that turned out dynamite food.  Not the case here.  Service was perfunctory but that could be owing to the place being so busy.  Coffee was decent.  Ordered the Western Omelet.  Huge.  To their credit, it was filled with slices of bacon instead of just pieces, slices of ham instead of diced pieces, and large pieces of sausage patties.  That having been said, the vegetables were soggy and the entire omelet lacked seasoning of any kind.  Totally bland.  The American Fries were a soggy mess and also without flavor.  Had to have at least a half order of their much ballyhooed French Toast after reading the rave reviews here.  Blah!!  Did these reviewers eat the same stuff as I did?  There was nothing remotely commendable about it.  It was soggy and relatively flavorless.  I tried it with and without syrup.  The syrup at least gave it flavor, albeit that of low grade imitation maple syrup.  It's been a while since I left that much food on my plate.  This may be a case of the Emperor's New Clothes as it is with so many of the \"In\" places in C-U.  \"Oh look, we found this quaint little cafe downtown; you must try it.\"  Of course, if you disagree you are obviously declasse.  Color me declasse."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the french toast at Sam's, and apparently I'm going to have to try that one day. But the thing I can't get over is the PANCAKES. They are absolutely delicious. I lived in Chicago for six years and found only one place that rivals Sam's pancakes in that huge city. As others have said, the decor leaves something to be desired, and the tables aren't as clean as they could be, but the prices are insanely cheap and the pancakes...oh, the pancakes. Plus, they have take out. :)"}
{"text":"Really nice tex-mex.  Inside looked very nice, and I'm sure the natives flock to the AC, but as tourists, of course, we sat outside.  Remarkable homemade chips, some corn, some sweet potato, some something else, all very good.  Salsa was a bit on the tomatoe side for my taste, but good nonetheless.  The approach is a bit off-putting since it's upstairs fo a mall, but once inside it's just classy tex-mex and a step above avegare at that."}
{"text":"I think I had chicken enchiladas (my boyfriend ate most of it).  My boyfriend wanted to go to Phoenix/Scottsdale for Southwestern food while my friend was in town for agency visits.  She got the waiter to take a photograph of us and when she spilled her margarita, they replaced it.  We chose this because we wanted a casual restaurant with salmon or shrimp.  We didn't know any better if this stuff is just fake Tex-Mex."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast in Champaign. It is a comfort-food-greasy-spoon restaurant. I recommend doing the breakfast before your shower in the morning and then go home for the shower afterward or you will smell like the restaurant all day! The food is very inexpensive and it has the best french toast in town. The seats are quite uncomfortable but fit in with the ambiance. For a while they served Lebonese food on some evenings but stopped doing that. I wish they would bring it back. It was excellent, high quality and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Like most restaurants at the Biltmore Fashion Park (and malls in general), Sam's Cafe feels very corporate (and it is part of the Canyon Cafe chain), but don't let that hold you back here.  While there are better Southwestern places around, Sam's does a decent job with everything.  I've done dinner and drinks a few times before, but most recently had happy hour stuff at the bar - with reasonably priced margaritas, and friendly bartenders too.  Decent, but so-so chicken tortilla soup and quesadillas.  Jake is right.  This can be a pretty good date place, when you go with a pretty good date.  My last dinner here was an awful date gone awry, but thankfully the food was the saving grace here (or maybe it was by default).  Let's just say that my date almost got a swift kick in the ass on the way out and my delicious chile-rubbed steak almost got thrown as a weapon Napoleon Dynamite style.  But I digress, back to the dinner.  The steak was cooked as I asked (medium), and had a great marinade with a flavorful spiced rub, but the chile mashed potatoes were OK, and thought it lacked that chile punch that I was hoping for.  While the food quality is OK here, it's just that - average."}
{"text":"I stopped at Sam's with a few others while attending a conference at the U of I. We all agreed that it was fantastic and full of charm. I ordered the ribeye and eggs breakfast with a half order of french toast. The french toast is covered with powdered sugar and is crispy on the outside and soft and cinnamon-y on the inside. I believe the owner dips the toast in pancake batter before frying it. Regardless of how its made, its wonderful. The steak (obviously not of Smith and Wollensky quality) was tasty and cooked to medium rare. Its juices went perfectly with the over easy eggs and crispy american fires that came along for the ride.    Go here, you won't regret it. And if you do regret it, it'll only cost a few bucks."}
{"text":"I was skeptical the French toast could be the best in the world. Not anymore though. They were amazing, perfect and the best ive ever had."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning.  This place has a simple menu, no frill's, but the food and service was quick and good.  I ordered a ham and cheese omelet which was nice and thin. The omelet was perfectly cooked and stuffed with ham and cheese.  Like a perfect egg crepe.  After reading reviews on the French toast I did spilt a short stack with my husband to try it. French toast is amazing. My coffee cup never had a chance to be empty. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! So delicious, a customer finishing up when we sat down recommended the french toast and I'm glad we tried it.  Be prepared: Sam's is a small place so you may have a wait (like a line wait, not a take a # go get a coffee wait) and its cash only so be sure to stop at the ATM on your way."}
{"text":"Not good. And it's not been for a couple of years. There are advantages: good location, rarely busy, good for larger groups. But last few times we've been there have experienced average food and lousy service.  When joining my already seated group on Saturday (3/28) the high-school hostess wagged her finger in my face like an East German border guard, the waffle house waitress poked me in the shoulder to get my attention and the wife's chicken dish had to be sent back as there were only 2 measly pieces of chicken in it.  Only 2 beers on tap. Garbage."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Sam's.  Finally having a dentist appointment at 7 am (ICK!) meant that I was done and hungry by 7:45 this morning, so I went.  Sam's is a cute greasy spoon hilariously sandwiched between two slightly snobby upscale restaurants.  I like that about the place.  The service is fast, the food is super-quick and quite cheap (I got a breakfast special: bacon, 2 eggs and toast--for $3.50.  I know.)  I definitely got the feeling that this was a local place for a lot of the people and I was a 'new face,' but I didn't mind.  The food was fast and good.  I wish I'd tried a pancake, but I didn't this time.  I'd go back again.  Basically, it's no-frills, straight up fast and cheap service.  And that's refreshing. :)  Oh, and they don't take cards.  Bring cash.  It's not like you'll need a lot of it!"}
{"text":"Came out to Phoenix for an interview and they brought us HERE for lunch........ omg *drool*  The chips were amazing, especially the ones that were seasoned with pepper and other deliciousness. I had the salmon and a bite of the steak. SOSOSOSOSO good. Ahhh I want their chips now.   Also. The chocolate tamales were a sweet fare-thee-well. Yum."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place of all time here.  It's your typical cafe, everything done the way you would want it.  Don't even bother with Merry Anns just come straight to Sams.  So the food is greasy... if you're not into that you can order it light on the butter/grease.  They make everything to order (duh).  Sam and his family are some really hard working people and it shows.  I'm just so happy at Sams, bottomless coffee and eggs all to the tune of 5 dollars. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"French toast is amazing! We were told it's better and thicker when Sam is working but it was still extra yummy. Imagine if a pancake mated with french toast and danced in cinnamon... yeah that good.   Bacon was fresh and the right balance of crispy without being overdone. Scrambled eggs were made of real eggs and the hashbrowns (American fries) had a buttery taste we loved. Unpretentious, hole in the wall that is worth the drive. Cash only and bring change for the parking meters."}
{"text":"Met Sam as he was busy at the grill.  Paul and I went in to order some burgers.  The staff was very attentive.  I borrowed a pen to start my food diary. I really would like to see some Lebanese cuisine on the menu although Sam doesn't think he has the right clientelle.  He is a very sweet man and his brother was just in from Lebanon.  I noticed a Saint perched above the grill. He offtered to share one with me for protection.  He said I should place it above a door way of my home.  How cool is this guy anyway.."}
{"text":"My recent , but admittedly brief, experience was terrific! The service was fast and friendly, the price was good, and the food was really, really good.   A friend and I stopped for a brief appetizer and margarita before heading to the Lyle Lovett concert. Margaritas for $3.00 until 7 PM...YUM! I loved the chips and salsa. The chips are a mixed style and the salsa had an unusual, homemade flavor. We shared an order of chicken nachos and OMG...were they good. Whatever creamy sauce was added was a wonderful addition.   The atmosphere was nice and open; the more modern Southwest style was a refreshing change. And like I said above, the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and my favorite! Hubby and I went to Sams on a late Saturday afternoon.  It's a small diner with not that much room but the place only had a couple of tables full.  It's self seated and our we chose a table our waiteress promptly came over.  I ordered the all day breakfast special anf added potatoes and coffee.  I am not a coffee drinker so I asked the waitress if if could sub it for a hot chocolate.  To my surprise she  said yes"}
{"text":"Super cheap, tasty and quick. Sam's is awesome for breakfast. The place is small and a bit dingy, it epitomizes what I think of as a greasy spoon cafeteria but the food is great. You can't beat the $3.70 breakfast special (two eggs, pancakes and sausage or bacon). The waitstaff is friendly and fast and the owner is slinging the food on the griddle most days."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place more than 3 stars but I had problems with the service. It took forever just to take our drink order. After he took our meal order he came back 15 minutes later because he had lost our ticket and couldn't remember what we had ordered. Then when we finally got our food, it was wrong. So had to send it back. On the good side of things, the salsa and chips were really good. The chips were a mixture of many different kinds which made it interesting. I had the seared ahi tuna salad. It was really good."}
{"text":"Their fresh and warm chips and salsa were good. Ordered a margarita and immediately understood why they limit you to only 2. Woo hoo! I was feeling good. I had one of their specials which consisted of salmon and mango salsa and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken fajitas and said those were good too.   The white chocolate tamales as an after dinner snack (small dessert) was nice, but we still ordered cheesecake for dessert. I love cheesecake and have yet to try a bad piece.   I'm not a big fan of Tex-Mex, but I'd come here again."}
{"text":"I was going to this restaurant based on what people said on yelp and I wasn't disappointed! Food is cheap, breakfast special is $4 and it runs all day! Service was as quick as you can get and still have been freshly made! The decor is diveish but you aren't paying for a formal French you are paying for good cheap food fast! Also the french toast is dipped in pancake batter and is really delicious!!!! I know I will be going again!"}
{"text":"We were surprisingly pleased with breakfast at Sam's! Dirt cheap prices with tasty food; it almost seemed too good to be true.   The girls ordered a 1/2 order of French toast, while the guys got biscuits and gravy. The French toast was delicious; thick, but soft, and perfectly sweet. However, a 1/2 order was one piece of bread. This was much too small as a main meal even when paired with a side. The boys liked the biscuits and gravy, but said it was missing \"something,\" so they doused it in hot sauce. The half order was 2 biscuits, so a much better size to be paired with a side. They lost a star for funky portion sizes.   It's cash only, but there are no signs anywhere stating that policy, so they lose another star for that.   Overall, definitely stop by, just bring cash and ask about the size/portion of whatever you're ordering."}
{"text":"Best French toast in town!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for breakfast the other day, and it was pretty excellent.  I had the breakfast special for about $4.25, and it included two eggs, a few slices of bacon, and a short stack of outstanding pancakes.  The server was very friendly, and the food was brought out quickly.  I'd highly recommend this place for a low-key diner-style breakfast."}
{"text":"Supposedly this place was going to close down beacuse of the new condos going in. Thankfully they got an extension on their lease.  The condos aren't going in just yet.  The food here is consistently good.  The service was average. I really like the Sonoran meatloaf. It's a great location and you'll have a good meal here. The menu is pseudo tex-mex.  It's a good place to go on a date, an office lunch, take family, or out of towners over the age of 40.  Not a drinking place...at all.  I would not recommend the place for large groups or meeting friends.  It doesn't have that kind of vibe."}
{"text":"Not for folks with dietary concerns. Vegans beware, for sure. And don't bother trying to get something gluten-free. I don't think these folks know what that means, nor do they care. The staff seemed mentally scattered and \"out to lunch.\"  This is a standard, maybe even sub-par greasy spoon for carnivores and folks who want to have some classic, crappy American breakfast food. But to be fair, Sam's never claimed to be anything else. This local mainstay is secure in it's identity, and that's just fine.  I ordered a salad and a side of hashed browns - which were basically the only things I could order off the non-friendly menu. I asked for oil and vinegar for the salad dressing and was disappointed to learn that they only serve Hidden Valley Ranch, which they set on your table in the huge Costco-sized bottle. Again, it's a good thing this joint never claimed to be anything near classy.  The hashed browns were soggy, and I'm afraid to know what food cross-contaminants were migled in there.   My husband had the French toast and my mom had the pancakes, both of which were pretty standard diner fare.  This restaurant is just not for me, but lots of locals like it. If you want supremely informal service and greasy spoon grub,  you might give it a shot. But don't get your hopes up for anything special."}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews of this place a friend and I decided to try it. We were completely disappointed and frustrated afterwards.   When we first walked in I totally thought of turning around to leave, but I tried not to 'judge a book by its cover'. So we sat down and the service was just terrible. He talked way too fast and barely gave us time to respond. Didn't like him at all.   As for the food, we ordered their special - eggs, sausage, American fries, and pancakes. EHHHHH! It was edible, sure, but delicious? Yeahhhh, no. I only ate it because I was really hungry and we had to pay for it anyway.   The only positive thing I could say is it is cheap, so if you don't want to spend a lot on breakfast then I GUESS you should visit this place. By the way, CASH ONLY!* Another problem we had here."}
{"text":"Stood in there for twenty minutes before anyone noticed us. Four tables without people, all covered with plates and trash. We were told it would be awhile because there were no tables. Incredibly rude, clearly don't care for customers or loyalty. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"How have I lived in CU for 20 years and never visited Sam's Cafe? We go out to breakfast every Sunday and were getting tired of our usual spots, having whittled down the list to just a few for one reason or another. So glad I remembered seeing Yelp reviews of Sam's. The American fries are great, as is the french toast. Food was out to the table in what seemed like less than 5 minutes, freshly cooked. The kids split an order of french toast and I had the breakfast special. I think next time I'll skip the pancakes with the special and eat the 1/2 piece of french toast that the littlest one left on her plate. It's not much to look at, but is clean, great service, and good food. And all for just $17 for all 4 of us."}
{"text":"I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though."}
{"text":"Sam's Cafe has a Lebanese dinner menu now, like Amanda W. said, which includes the staples, such as hummos with a delicious puddle of olive oil,  crispy falafel, Greek salad chock full of feta, overstuffed dolmades, tabbouleh & baklava (not homemade, w/ pistachios).  Two highly recommended plates you can order are the Shish Taouk (chicken kebab) or Breaded Tilapia (one of their specials).   The woman who started the menu recently emigrated to the US after the tragedy in Lebanon. Go support local business!"}
{"text":"Wow. Greasy. Must be a southern thing. No clue how this has 4 stars.  French toast was hidden like a pancake."}
{"text":"The service was slow, despite it not being busy. When our good finally arrived, it wasn't particularly excellent. The eggs and potatoes tasted a bit like burnt spatula. It wasn't a bad meal, but it didn't warrant the 30 minute wait we experienced before getting it. Refills to our coffee were few and far between. Getting the check at the end was also a nightmare, taking a good 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Used to come here as a kid and had to visit again to see if it was still as good.  Seems like they've replaced the famous breadsticks with chips/salsa- but I'm not complaining- the chips were really yummy- sort of a sweet taste to them.  Wine selection was decent, waiter was a sweet heart too- he let us know pets are welcome to join you on the patio too- something about \"Paws on the Patio\", so if you're an animal lover it's a great place to bring the puppy.  Reminded me of the smaller sidewalk places off the pier in South Bay where everyone always brought their dogs.  As for food- we had the fajitas- very good- the steak wasn't overcooked like a lot of places tend to do, word of advice though- not good as left overs so make sure you bring your appetite and finish them there!  :)  Looking forward to going again- this time for margaritas!"}
{"text":"This place is what it is. A cheap greasy spoon dive with a cash only policy. If that sounds repulsive to you, don't go! If not, go and definitely have the French Toast. Service is ok at best but wth?"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Champaign!  I always get the breakfast special when I am in town.  Best pancakes I have found anywhere.  And it's very cheap.  Decent lunch too.  A good greasy spoon downtown."}
{"text":"As good as a cheap and greasy breakfast gets.  Very friendly staff, and it really feels like a neighborhood restaurant.  The breakfast special with coffee is a fantastic deal, and the refills keep coming.    Better food than Merry Ann's in some ways, since it is the same type of food, but Sam's is only open during the day.  I'll hopefully get a chance to go back for dinner.  Overall, this is one of the best of breed for greasy delicious breakfast food at low low prices."}
{"text":"This place gets so much hype on Yelp that my friends and I decided to try it. Sam's Cafe is super cute-looking from the outside. But that's where the good stops. Well, the waiter was really nice. But other than those two things, I see no positives about this place. The food was floppy and soggy and the utensils were not washed well... Maybe we ordered all the wrong things, though we did order the vaunted French toast,... Seems like that could be a possibility seeing that this place has 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ok...so Sam's Cafe is probably one of my favorite lunch places to go in Phoenix, I would go alone just for the fresh made chips and salsa they bring to your table, the menu items here are quite unique and to say the least are good for the most part.  Every time I have been to this place they have never been that busy, but I will say there service is lacking, it seems that when ever I go there I get the dyslexic high school waiter who can't remember to bring me my refills I ask for or I get the recovering meth addict that hates life.  I usually end up getting the mushroom and spinach casadia which never disappoints, I like this places ambiance, the only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the service always seems to blow."}
{"text":"Sam's has the best pancakes I've had in quite a while. The coffee was really good too and my bacon and eggs were delicious. Sam is a charming man with a big smile, and the other staff is great too. This is so different from the bland franchise food that dominates modern American life - authentic diner food and really cheap :))  For a while, Sam's served Lebanese food on Thursday/Friday nights, but not at the moment. Wish it would make a comeback, because I've heard the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I was a student here for years but never tried it until a recent trip back to C-U.  I got the  breakfast special, which seems to be the way to go (other than perhaps the French Toast). The bacon was just okay (it was clearly not fresh), but the eggs were very good, and the pancakes were the best I'd had in quite some time.  If I were going back, I'd probably try the sausage - it looked better than the bacon.  And it was still quite affordable - I think $6 covered my meal, including tax and tip!"}
{"text":"While I can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch, Sam's Cafe has a great Lebanese dinner menu on Thursday and Friday nights.  They have a good, plentiful vegetarian combination plate which I have gotten the last two times I've been there.  On our most recent visit, I noticed that the woman who is running the menu has specials available, but only seems to offer them to people who either ask or are repeat customers.  The meat dishes, according to my fiancee, are also quite good.  I'm hoping that she will keep these two nights open for a long time to come."}
{"text":"We are from San Francisco recently relocated to Chicago and have eaten out at many places. From the Westside to the midWest this is one of the best places we have ever eaten at.   Quality Meals. Quick and kind service.  Had the French toast and the wife had eggs and pancakes.  Thanks Sam"}
{"text":"This is the place that we always seem to end up at when people come in to town for business. It's one of those places that's relatively convenient, has decent parking, and can handle larger crowds since they don't ever seem to be even remotely busy.  I will agree that when I have been there with small, personal groups, service has been unbearably slow. They would definitely earn one more star if there were even a whiff of concern... but when the group is larger, we have always received exemplary service - dare I say size does matter?  The food is actually above standard, for its kind. I love the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast (it has lots of goat cheese inside and is covered in their red pepper cream sauce - which honestly I think would be good spread over an old leather sneaker). I could eat the Adovo Chicken Pasta twice a week and never get tired of it (same reference to red pepper cream sauce). My ex swore that the Meatloaf was the best (but really, what can't be improved by a generous portion of bacon?!!). And my all time favorite has to be Chile Rubbed Sirloin - it's flavorful, without being overpowering, always cooked exactly as requested, and generally requires the threat of forking when others realize that \"it looks better than mine.\"  If you like Margaritas. You should be happy with what Sam's has to offer. The Orange Beso makes my toes tingle. Fortunately, they limit those to two servings - otherwise I might find myself behaving badly. They have several \"house margaritas\" all of which I've enjoyed (really it's not my fault, I work with a lot of social alcoholics... it's the only way to deal with the stress).  My final offering is that this particular location (I haven't ever tried at the others, so they might be accommodating as well), is great for private functions. They will basically close down whatever portion of the restaurant you might need, either feed you buffet style or from the menu, work with you on drink coupons, let you hang corporate flair, etc.  If you are in a pinch for a business gathering in a relaxed environment give it a try."}
{"text":"Great ambience and absolutely adorable bar tender. And the second bar tender was really nice, too. We didn't want to wait 45 minutes (though our bar neighbors were seated within 10 minutes of the 45 min wait), so we elected to eat at the bar. Got the top shelf margs and a chef's sampler. Never got  around to ordering a main course: we were stuffed. After 2 margaritas each, we headed back to the hotel..........."}
{"text":"If you go to Sam's, you probably already know what you're going for. It's not for ambiance or subtle flavors or lunch... it's for delicious breakfast food. It's not exactly a new trend to sing the praises of small greasy-spoon style places, but there is a reason for that: no $30 fancy brunch can ever really inspire the same satisfaction that  getting gratifyingly greasy french toast, pancakes, sausage, and hash browns for a few dollars can."}
{"text":"The food is consistent and pretty good.  It will not satisfy any craving you have for Mexican food, but it may keep those cravings at bay for a while.   I'm really only reviewing Sam's to give them kudos for being \"dog friendly.\"  At the Biltmore location at least they will allow you to have dogs outside on the patio.  Even though I don't have dogs, some of my friends do and I have been to Sam's Cafe with them several times because it seemed like the only place we could eat without leaving the dogs in the car."}
{"text":"Four stars bc they could clean up the place and yes, utensils are just old..  but what are you expecting from an old place that hasn't been renovated in a while? ok enough of the rant..  I came in because it was rated highly and I did get the French Toast, which is their specialty and recommended by others. It was Amazing, to say the least. I definitely will be back here again Just for the French Toast, but I'm sure the other food has to be good as well as I saw others plates come out.   The only stipulation about this place I have, is they only take cash.. so remember to bring Cash with you."}
{"text":"Cheesiest omelette EVER! And it's delicious melty American cheese, not oily coagulated cheddar. And I swear these has browns are from scratch. Deeeeelicious!"}
{"text":"Looks like I'm on a roll with getting horrible service at what are usually pretty decent restaurants lately!  I went to Sam's Cafe last night with two of my girlfriends and based on my previous experience at the downtown location, I figured we'd get a pretty decent meal.  Not the case!  Carter, our server, was awful.  I hate to be so hard on him but as soon as he took our drink order and we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, he went downhill from there.  My friend Allyson ordered the rotisserie chicken special and I ordered the applewood smoked pecan salmon.  DeDe had a few question before she decided and Carter not only had no clear answers for her, he didn't bother to try to get the answers.  Unacceptable!  (Just to clarify, these were basic questions such as 'what kind of vegetables come on the fire grilled vegetable tacos?' and 'What is the marinade for the chicken fajitas?')    The next thing we know, we are given their special chips and salsa... I love how they combine sweet and salty in a colorful arrangement!  Those were delicious.  However, it was a good ten minutes until we saw our water and when you are eating salty chips and salsa, it's nice to have something to wash it down with!  Minus star #2.  So, our food comes and DeDe's fajitas are totally different than what Carter explained.  She isn't bitchy about sending them back but kindly asks for just the chicken and vegetables on a plate since that is what she was expecting.  This is where the 3rd missing star comes in - I am not kidding when I tell you that DeDe did not get her food until after both Allyson and I were done eating ours (and we were eating really slow)!  It was not right... and Carter was not very apologetic.  He came over to offer us a free dessert but being that we are all in healthy eating mode, we declined.  They did take the fajitas off the bill in the end, but it was expected at this point.  So, I know it was just one bad experience, but if I feel like Sam's Cafe again, I will probably head to the downtown location or just have lower expectations in the future.  Bottom line:  decent meal + bad service = 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Best kept breakfast secret in Champaign. This little hole in the wall has a small menu and does it all right. The french toast is simple and perfectly done. The location is small, but everyone there is friendly in close quarters and it has a wonderful old-time family feel. Its always nice to find someone who knows what they are doing and does not need any extra flares or frills."}
{"text":"Okay, so i had a friend in from CO and she wanted Southwestern cuisine so I suggested Sam's even though I hadn't been there in 10 years.  First they serve you with their version of chips and salsa and I don't think I will ever settle for regular chips and salsa ever again after this. There were 4 different chips..2 had various spices, one had the taste of powdered sugar and the last were sweet potato. Each combined with the salsa was a bite of culinary delight. I ordered the Ahi tuna sandwich and was satisfied with my selection. However my friend ordered the black and blue quesadilla and it was beyond fantastic! Defintiely recommend even if just for cocktails and their chips. Oh I almost forgot.. you get a stick of white chocolate wrapped in a husk with your check! So either way you WILL be having dessert. ;)"}
{"text":"Please don't go here. The food is the worst I've ever had in my entire life. There is a reason for the low prices the food is god awful. They use margarine instead of butter which we all know is one molecule away from plastic. The bacon is some sort of a pig mixture bacon but definitely not good. Eggs come out of a milk carton. The smell of the coffee was horrible the water was free but it tasted like chlorine. I am sick to my stomach and I only had a few bites of what they call pancakes. I cannot believe this place is still open. Worst breakfast experience in my entire life and I was in the United States Navy."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving, and Sams Cafe is a classic example of that.  No doubt, there are places that look cuter with nicer decor but they don't have Sams food.  Sams is my favorite place for breakfast in Chambana.  A big reason for that is the French Toast.  It is simply the best I have every had.  The rest of the food is good, but I can rarely get myself to order anything but that.   Wait staff is friendly and efficient.  This is a great place for friends to grab a some food before heading up to a tailgate or after a great night out in Champaign.  Sams is definitely a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Sam's is a homey breakfast cafe located downtown with hardworking staff and delicious breakfast food. They may have my favorite omelets in the area, even better than the giant ones at Original Pancake House. The cooks clearly take pride in their product; seems like every item is made to perfection. Very high quality breakfast food every time I've been here."}
{"text":"It's like stepping back in time where diners like this were a staple for breakfast for many. They had many tables in the back where the good old boys were catching up over their breakfasts.  It might look run down or old, but everything looked clean. The server was nice and attentive.  I had the breakfast special with 2 scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and fluffy pancakes. Nothing fancy, but you could tell the guy at the grill had the experience of cooking many a breakfast like this over the years. Very inexpensive too. You find the bathrooms by going through back door to storage area and it's to your right. Simple food but simply good too."}
{"text":"They have the  best French toast. My husband always ordered Denver omelette where we were here. The price is also very reasonable :)"}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall was a great find.  Service was fast and friendly, customers were a little gruff, but nice.  Food was great for this greasy spoon.  We had t-bone steaks and french toast for breakfast.  Small place, so I can imagine it fills up fast.  Not a long wait for anything and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"So good. Little diner vibe with great, affordable food. Try the eggs with corned beef hash."}
{"text":"A step back in time to a Bogart movie, quick, diner food, no frills but tons of atmosphere, easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"I like how they do things at Sam's. It's upstairs in the Biltmore Mall but they manage to be the most laid back of all the bar/restaurants in the area. They convincingly do mexican food in a southwestern style with all sorts of interesting twists and spins on dishes that I haven't seen before. The chicken enchiladas are dee-lish and the margaritas are some of the best I've had.   Service is touch and go when they're busy but for the most part I've always been content with their staff. It's a pretty good date spot and the prices are reasonable, especially considering the caliber of the food they serve."}
{"text":"This greasy spoon effectively fills its downtown niche:  no-frills service, no-frills food, and no-frills decor.    I wanted a Denver omelette but their version had onions, tomatoes, and ham instead of the expected onions, peppers, and ham.  Oh well, I ordered it anyway.  It was very good and PIPING hot.  I burned my mouth on the end when I started eating, and on the middle part several minutes later.  I also got a short stack of flapjacks for \"dessert\" and they were okay.  Top it all off with a cold glass of OJ and you have yourself a decent breakfast for $10.16.    I was here around 9 am on Sunday, and had no trouble getting the seat of my choice.  When I left, it was close to filling up, and I don't doubt that the college kids roll in here starting mid-morning."}
{"text":"Cheap.  But that is where it begins and ends.  Otherwise, it is just a below average greasy spoon with a staff that is apathetic or bored or both."}
{"text":"Sam's Cafe is amazing!  One of the best \"hole in the walls\" I have ever been to!  If you like french toast, this is the place to go.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  Walk in and seat yourself at an open table before they are gone!  You can see the man himself working the grill most mornings.  The reviews that say Sam's is \"run down\" are way off the mark.  Sam's is not meant to be Baccaro.    PS: Stop playing Pokemon and eat some french toast!"}
{"text":"Did you know the specials are here at the top? Because the greasily myopic server will remind you of this no matter how frequently you visit.  You could get the best damned French toast in the world at Sam's every weekend, and I'm pretty sure he'd still point out the special.  Did you read what I wrote there?  Best. Damned. French. Toast. In. The. World.  How is it so good?  That's a good question.  Somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup.  If you like French toast, there's no reason to consider anything else on the menu.  BUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly over-medium eggs, and delicious pancakes.  The coffee is, well, blackish, but it's really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee.  Your mug will always be full, for better or for worse.  My husband and I moved away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back.  There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign.  There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign.  But there's only one Sam's, and we'll keep coming back as long as it sticks around."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of best breakfast hidden treasures in Champaign. Bs & Gs and French toast are spot on, and the food is a great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Sometimes getting back to basics can separate the good restaurants from the great restaurants. This place is great. Simple. Breakfast. Food.   Sam's Cafe is a small unique diner in downtown Champaign (BTW, Downtown Champaign is winning!) that serves breakfast. It's super fast and I had a great classic breakfast. I ordered eggs, sausage and Gus' Famous French Toast. I of course asked the waitress why it's so famous and she said well, they use cake batter to make it. WORD!?!  Yes, word. This was the best tasting panfrench-cake/toast I ever had. The hubby said it taste like French toast and I think it tastes like a pancake. It's soooo buttery with crispy edges, clearly made with buttermilk. They seem to just soak it in butter and then I poured hot maple syrup on it. And then...Yes! Yes! Yeeeeessss! Fireworks!   Okay, I'm back...$10 for the meal and the meal was as if your granny cooked it in a skillet. I deducted 1 star for only accepting cash."}
{"text":"We probably went to some other \"Sams cafe\" , otherwise i do not understand all the good reviews about that restaurant....  We had a bad experience .....bad food and bad service.  I will not recommend to my friends !!!"}
{"text":"True diner with good food at a very reasonable price. Traditional breakfast options and it won't kill the wallet. Plus they know how to do grits right and that's not common when I travel north."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and I was quite happy. I had a bacon and cheese omelette and hash browns. It was inexpensive and very tasty. It is a no frills greasy spoon type of place but I kind of like that."}
{"text":"Greasy diner food as you expect - quaint and retro, a bit worn at the edges, makes you put on your rose colored glasses.  There's no turkey sausage, muesli, oatmeal or egg white omelets here.  Heck there's nothing green - want fruit?  There's ketchup on the table!  What you get is exactly what what you want if you're going to a place like this - all-American comfort food - no frills - just carbs, eggs, and pig meat in various combinations.  Service is friendly and quick, prices are cheap.  The food is satisfying; but enjoy the feeling while you can because there's no way to rationalize this stuff later.  For those on a \"diet,\" some items are offered in 1/2 portions - LOL.  Pancakes are more flat and crispy than light and fluffy which is great in my book.   The French toast is like the illegitimate love child of Aunt Jemima and Anthony Bourdain ... it's good but you're not quite sure where it came from!  Biscuits and gravy were good enough and the pork sausage patties were nicely caramelized on the flat top."}
{"text":"It's difficult to describe the magic of Sam's. No, wait, no it's not. It's delicious, basic, cheap food."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! I went here for a friends birthday dinner and were greeted with a friendly smile and \"hello.\"  Chips and salsa lined the table and were a mix or corn and blue corn, and i think some of them had been rolled in cinnamon and pepper. I had to force myself to stop eating them.  A friend and I ordered chicken fajitas and we wanted to split the entree and the server brought us out two plates with the guac., sour cream, etc on both plates. That was nice. The beans and rice were delicious, the server had a pleasant attitude (and I could tell she had a lot going on) and she kept my water full.  She brought out a dessert tray and told us about each item. THEN after she brought the check she came back with little white chocolate tamales for everyone! (White chocolate in a corn husk.) Holy cow! How awesome is that!"}
{"text":"Sam's Cafe has great breakfast food and very friendly staff at a good price.  What more can you ask for?  I had the corned beef hash with two eggs and toast - just the right amount of food.  I've heard the French Toast and pancakes are also great."}
{"text":"A friend of mine is in town and staying at the Ritz Carlton on Camelback. In meeting up, we ventured across the street and found Sam's Caf√©. The menu was big and many things looked good. I was busy looking at the spacious dining area and the food options when the waitress arrived. My friend went with the raspberry margarita while I had  1/2 coke,  1/2 diet coke.   The waitress was very attentive and dropped by many times to make sure we were fine. The chips and salsa were amazing! I saw some Yelp reviews on my phone that talked about the chips. I thought really? They are chips! Can they really be that exciting? Damn skippy! In fact, most of the time I didn't even put them in salsa-  they were so good just by themselves.   My friend ordered the Red Rock Meatloaf served with peppers, bacon and onions, mashed potatoes and she swapped spinach in place of the corn on the cob. I went with the Applewood Smoked Pecan Salmon. Damn! It was salmon with pecans, there was a side spinach and the salmon was served on a bed of mashed sweet potatoes and a red papaya and serrano chile sauce. I detected something else that seemed like slightly spicy apple sauce, but I don't know what it was.  An excellent meal, nice atmosphere, descent area and above average service. Each entr√©e was about $17 and the margarita was $6.50. No room for dessert - with the exception of the white chocolate tamale brought out with the bill, but the tray showed several items. Maybe next time?"}
{"text":"Oh my. That is the best pancake I've had in ages. Crispy at the edges, fluffy in the middle. Wow. Perfection.  I loved one of the previous reviewers wining about the lack of gluten free avocado toast made with free range avocados. This is not that kind of place. The food is simple and straightforward, the kind your grandma (or hers, if you're the college age crowd) would have served. Eggs, a pile of bacon, a fantastic pancake, a good cup of Joe. Now finish your plate. The garden needs weeding and those chickens won't gather their own eggs.  In short, old school hole in the wall with friendly staff dishing out comfort food. And I mean \"hole in the wall\" in the most gloriously comfortable way. If you're the type of person who just can't even, skip it. If you are literally anyone else, just go.  And have a pancake."}
{"text":"Environment is very shabby with some old chairs and tables. But the price and the taste is amazing. We two ppl ordered 4 things. Huge pancakes, very good omelette and waffle too. Even the oj tastes different.  Strongly recommend.  Parking is kinda difficult sometimes and only takes cash."}
{"text":"Seafood Fajitas... very good....  they also have one of my favortie Pinot Noir's La Crema!  they used to have this great little southwesten... Chocolate thing they gave you after the meall ... so missed that..."}
{"text":"I'm such a huge fan of hole-in-the-walls. As my friend Andrew W. once said, they have nothing else going for them but their food. Therefore, the ones that stay open are successful by the sole virtue of their food. And that's exactly why I'm giving 5 stars to Mr. Sam and his cafe of dive heaven.   I have many regrets from my college career. One of these is that I didn't discover Sam's until late in the game. I get to experience two of my favorite words here: CHEAP BRUNCH. Breakfast platter special for $3.75??? Fluffy french toast for under $5???? Pancakes? Omelettes!!!?? OH YES PLEASE GIMME NAO I WANT IT I WANT IT SO BAD.  Footnotes:  DO NOT eat here if: - you are on a diet. I don't think the cooks know what that word means. No Lite Butter or Diet Fat Free Bacon to be found here. - you are a snob. The \"decor\" consists of plastic furniture and faded ads in lieu of actual ceiling tiles.  - you are a germaphobe.... but really, why would you be? Snap out of it, take a class in immunology. Germs ain't got nothin' on you. (Sorry, bio nerd leaking through.)  DO eat here if: - you are a broke-ass college kid. Full meals for under $5 ... how could you resist? - you love breakfast foods. The french toast is particularly noteworthy.    Advice: CASH ONLY; FOR BFAST, CLOSES AT 2 PM (I think - it's been a long time since I was there. It's either 2 or 1...)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! All walks of life commingle here...I was kind of scared when I walked in how the food was going to be bc it doesn't look like anything has been updated since it opened in the 60's but was literally the best breakfast joint I have ate at in years! Coffee is always hot and fresh and the French toast is to die for! A must try"}
{"text":"Best value in town. The breakfast and lunches are just \"ok\", greasy spoon standard, but their low, low prices bring them into the 3-4 stars territory. I would not say the place is dirty (because it's not), but I hope they wash their hands after touching that cash register.  The Lebanese dinners are really special, as when we went, Sam's wife was there and talked to us about the food and culture of Lebanon, really making us feel welcome. She explained every item on the menu for the noobs and really seemed to care about us and our experience. The food was great.  I cant justify 5 stars for this, as it is not high cuisine, and the decor, even for a greasy spoon, is pretty poor. But when your meal is less than $5 (with a drink, and fries), who's complaining?"}
{"text":"Good, cheap breakfast.  After seeing all the excellent reviews here--many of which mention the fantastic french toast--how could I order anything BUT french toast?  It was definitely pretty amazing.  Delicious, and a perfect serving.  I got a half order of American Fries on the side and it was plenty.  The only reason you'd need a full order is if you intend to split it with someone!  Basically hash browns, they were delicious.  Crispy bits mixed with soft buttery masses of potato that leave a little bit of grease on the plate.  Sounds disgusting?  Trust me, it's awesome.  Considering the simplicity of our order, it seemed like it took a while to get our food.  The wait wasn't ridiculous by any means, just a little longer than I expected.  Still, we were in and out within an hour.  The atmosphere is probably going to take a few visits to grow on me.  It felt cramped.  Once we settled into our little nook I felt more comfortable.  Clearly, if you're coming here, you're coming for the food...not the ambiance.  And the food is indeed good.  GREAT, even.  I'll be back...for more decadent french toast...and scrumptious hash browns..."}
{"text":"The biggest flaw of this place is the extremely slow wait times. There seems to be only one cook. I set my parking meter to an hour and twenty minutes and it was expired by the time I returned to my car. That meant that we waited around fifty minutes for our food. The staff is relatively amiable. However, I did catch them complaining about a customer who wanted her order done sooner. They talk about that customer as if she was in the wrong. Another problem are the extremely small tables.   Its greatest strength are its really good prices. The breakfast special is $4.75 I believe for two eggs, two pancakes, and two sausages or bacon. It costs $6 if you want to include the misnamed American fries and coffee. Their \"American\" fries is actually very soft hash browns."}
{"text":"It is a small crowded place serving inexpensive and ok food. But I think it is over rated in yelp."}
{"text":"Bland biscuits and gravy and underwhelming french toast (despite all the reviews to the contrary) made this a cheap, but forgettable dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been hesitant to try Sam's cafe due to many Yelp complaints about the cleanness of this place, and now I am full of regrets! OK - it was not sparkly and shiny, but not dirty either. I sat at the counter, and the counter top was clean. The kitchen looked also properly cleaned - both grill and food prep area were well taken care of.  I had the all-day breakfast special, which was nothing fancy but good old basics. Eggs were runny as I like, potatoes were buttery and had crispy edges, pancakes were flopping and yummy. Tasty!   Coffee, in fact, was not good at all - more like coffee flavored warm dark water. But, my server was good at keeping my mug full and hot.  I will definitely come back to try French toasts!"}
{"text":"I'll make this one as easy as possible. Sam's Cafe serves  good breakfast food at reasonable prices. I mean their breakfast special is like $5 and you get 2 eggs, bacon, and pancakes. And they use REAL butter. No other places that I've been to have quality food for a price like that. The place is pretty small so if you have more than 6 people, it's not happening. Strangely for as small as the place is, I've never waited for a table, even in a busy Saturday morning. There is like one server/busboy/cashier and he is awesome. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Took my dad for breakfast and even he noticed it was dirty and that's saying something! The wait person was prompt and friendly. The food was just s bit too greasy and eggs were over cooked. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"The French toast, oddly pancake style, is to die for. Also great to eat the ethnic food in the evening when available."}
{"text":"Sam's Cafe, is a diner our host choose to take us and if you like a good breakfast diner this is your spot!   All I had was coffee cause I'm not a huge breakfast kinda guy... But the Coffee was awesome!  Way better then your normal bottomless pot type diner coffee.  The rest of the gang ordered Omelettes,  and French toast and both looked superb..  They were excited by the amount of food you can get for not much moola!   Everyone was super stoked about our Sam's stop, and the staff was great and kept my coffee full!"}
{"text":"Saturday is Happy Hour day at Sam's Caf√©.  Happy because we hadn't been there in a while and happy because Sam's has improved since the last time we were there:) I say \"judge slowly\" and \"give people a second chance\" and \"a stitch in time, saves nine\" and all kinds of other inappropriate adages...but my point is that sometimes a second chance is in order. Sam's Caf√© had been in the rotation for a few years and then we had a couple of poor experiences there, and just didn't go back...you know how it is...there's a lot of competition for the dining dollar (it used to be \"dollars\" but the recession/depression has hit everyone!). But, this isn't about then...it's about now, so let's get up to date, shall we? The Beautiful Carin and I headed for the club last Saturday to sweat off the weeks caloric build up and sweat it off we did! (you know, I think I sweat so much because I come from ice age survivor stock and here I am trying to live in the desert!). Anyway, after we finished our extremely grueling, yet fulfilling programs of physical exercise, got ourselves all cleaned up, (lookin' good and smellin' sweet) we were talking between ourselves (as married people often do) and trying to figure how to reward ourselves for the excellent workouts we had just finished. How about a nice big lunch? Sam's Caf√© has Happy Hours on Saturday's and Sunday's that run from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm.  Well, that's just inspired! We tottered in and sat at the bar (I think that's going to be a defining happy hour \"move\" for us), and the barman greeted us with a warmth and enthusiasm normally reserved for long lost play cousins...a good start:) We looked at the happy hour menu and they have some nice selections for really good prices. We ordered roast pork sliders with a chipotle barbecue sauce, Carin's  \"go-to\" selection...grilled chicken nacho's and Sedona Spring Rolls (also served with the chipotle barbecue sauce and pico de gallo). While were waiting for the food to arrive, Sam's minions brought us more food...chips and salsa.  Now, I don't want anyone to think Sam's is mexcian food...it's not. The whole place is more \"southwest inspired\" as opposed to \"southwest\", or \"Mexican\" or \"authentic\".  They have d√©cor that looks sort of Fredrick Remington meets Javier Sordo Madaleno...nice, southwest-ish/modern. The chairs in the dining room are, frankly, less than comfortable but they fit the d√©cor, so, OK. Just don't complain to me when they make your butt sore after 20 minutes! Back to the chips and salsa...I like the flour tortilla chips that Sam's serves, as well as the blue corn and sweet potato chips and the salsa is decent as well...very tomatoey, but spicy and flavorful, but it's not Mexican...not for everybody, but we were happy:) The actual food portion of our lunch came before we became completely engorged with the chips portion. Everything was very tasty.  The pork roast sliders were truly delightful...moist, seasoned perfectly on soft warm rolls:) (BTW, I'm reasonably certain that you can't get swine flu from eating pork roast, but I will say that the roast pork sliders \"flew\" off the plate:) . The Sedona Spring Rolls have plenty of spice and heat, and are also very nice. All in all, a very solid Happy Hour offering for $18 and change (before tip). Go, sit at the bar (always better service and your butt will thank me), and enjoy Sam's Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Interior: 8/10, Food: 8/10, Service: 8/10.  I used to take out-of-towners here all the time.  Now that I moved away, I had to visit Sam's. I love the bread sticks and the smear that comes with it.  The food wasn't as great as I remembered, but it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"The best french toast you will ever eat!!!  I don't even like french toast, and I went to this place and ordered it based on reviews and I am so glad I did.  I'm a believer. It has this crispy outer area and is drenched in cinnamon sugar, and perfect with syrup or without.  A half order is plenty one, but go all out and get the full order!  You'll be glad you did.  Prices are great, I think a burger is under $3.00!  I have never ordered anything other than french toast and hash browns.  The hash browns are darn good too.   The place is a little dumpy- poster boards on the ceiling, really uncomfortable chairs, broken equipment sitting out in the open, tables go uncleaned for awhile.  But none of this matters, it's clean enough and the food is soooo good!  Side-note: they only take cash.  So go to the ATM right now, get some cash (you won't need more than $15 for two) and head over to Sam's cafe and order the french toast!"}
{"text":"Really good value tasty breakfast/brunch. The all day breakfast special is only $5.10! Nice place to meet with friends, friendly staff and nice atmosphere :-)"}
{"text":"There are two reasons to come to Sam's:  First, you're too lazy to cook and want to eat a meal of comparable quality at a super reasonable price. I got two eggs, three pieces of bacon, and two pieces of buttered toast for $4.95.   Two, you want their breakfast special. Two slabs of French toast lathered in pancake batter and cooked into the most delectable squishy crispness you can imagine. Do your mouth a favor (flavor?), and order it. You'll cry a little once your plate is empty, but oh good god it's worth it."}
{"text":"People seem to really like Sam's, though I am not quite sure why.  I think it is average.  Not great, not bad, just middle of the road food with a Southwestern twist.  Kind of like the Cheesecake Factory.  The food tastes good, but anything meal tastes good if it is loaded with fat."}
