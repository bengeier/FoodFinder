{"text":"Ce n'ai pas parce que vous faites la même forme d'un pretzel que vous pouvez l'appeler \"Pretzel\". rien à voir avec le vrai, sauf la forme. pas du tout la même farine ni la même façon de faire. C'est comme si on faisait une baguette ou un toast en forme de croissant. Ce n'est pas un pretzel. c'est tout simplement du pain en forme de Pretzel."}
{"text":"A little pricey for what it is but I'd be damned if this wasn't a lovely snack every time I went! Went with the sugar & cinnamon twice and the caramel one once. Always a yummy and warm pretzel was provided within 3 minutes. Hit the spot for sure! 

Caramel one was just OK but the sugar & cinnamon ones were the bomb."}
{"text":"Mr. Pretzels is one of those discoveries that is simultaneously dangerous and awesome.  Dangerous in the sense that their fresh-baked pretzels are so addictive that you could easily come here every day and enjoy one of them.  Awesome in that the pretzels are so delicious.  You can always smell this place a mile away as they bake all the pretzels and it makes it hard to resist the temptation to indulge in one.

They only have a handful of pretzel types but that is all they need if you ask me.  My go-to is the classic pretzel which is served soaked in melted butter and sprinkled with plenty of salt.  This particular location does a great job of baking the pretzel in that the exterior has a nice little crust to it while the interior is soft and chewy.  They also are always served fresh or at the very least kept warm after they come out of the oven so it is divine.

The price is pretty reasonable.  A simple pretzel is usually a little less than $4 but the price goes up if you opt for the more elaborate choices.  It is definitely worth it though."}
