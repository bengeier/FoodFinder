{"text":"Not bad, but not great. 

I came here with my family for a casual dinner. One thing to note is that the service is exceedingly friendly and polite for a Chinese restaurant. I'm used to the service being a bit more brusque. 

The atmosphere is super casual, reminiscent of the Chinese restaurants of my youth, when food was king and walls were pink.

We ordered the eggplant with minced meat (pork), which had a good texture but had more flavour from the sauce than from the eggplant. We also had the braised tofu and fish collar (which was pretty good), pork neck with scallion (which was okay but a little stingy with the meat) and some sweet and sour pork thing, which was quite good. They also offer lobster and some fancier dishes, but we ordered off the portion of their menu where you can get 2 dishes for $19.99, 4 dishes for $26.99, 5 dishes for $32.99 or 6 dishes for $38.99.  Dinner for 4 with leftovers was about $40 all in, with a good tip.

I don't think I'll be rushing back here anytime quick, there are a lot of places like this. If you're in the area and looking for a decent meal at a good price, this is an option."}
{"text":"This place has taken over the old New Elite Restaurant that was a family favourite of mine.  We shed a few tears when we found it had closed its doors.

Cue replacement New Regime which invokes images of the Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao.  

We had hopes that the replacement would be somewhat comparable.  We should've known better.

Gone are the days of dinner specials, and in with expensive, and bland food coupled with unprofessional serving staff.  We had to repeat one of our orders 3 times and the wait time after placing the order until we actually got served our first dish was unacceptably long (by Chinese standards, anything that takes longer than 15 minutes wait is long).  

We ate:

Salt & Pepper Pork Cutlet - Crappy cuts of pork, with a high fat to meat ratio.  Taste-wise it was good, but if I wanted to bite into a big hunk of fat, I could do so more cheaply by devouring a stick of butter.

Scallop/Shrimp/Squid & Veggie Stir Fry - Ah... memories of what the end of my primary school rubber eraser tasted like finally made its way back... They overcooked it and then some.  They were pretty scant with the seafood too!

Garlic Seafood Fried Rice - Too wet.  Fried rice is supposed to be made from day-old rice so that it soaks in the oil.  And not as garlicky as it should be.  If there were vampires up in this joint - we'd all be dead. 

Satay Beef with Vermicelli - This was the only good dish of the evening.  Generous serving of beef, great flavour, and lots of vermicelli.  

At the end of the day the bill came to about $50 with tax and tip.  

Long gone are the days of complimentary sweet soup too - but I suppose my waistline should thank you for the serving of fruit (oranges)."}
{"text":"This place is actually not bad. The food is hit and miss. The lotus, okra and celery dish (I forget the exact name) was pretty good as was the chicken slices and celery dish. The chicken slices and minced beef fried rice is absolutely awesome! Avoid the cashew dishes (shrimp and cashew) because they don't know how to cook the cashews right. Service is spotty. They forgot one of our orders but the food comes out at a decent pace overall. Service is courteous."}
