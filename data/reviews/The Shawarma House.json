{"text":"The food wasn't particularly bad but I also have very little experience in the shawarma and gyro area.  Much like the other 2 reviews I had an issue where by I mentioned the specials that they had listed outside and the person taking the orders said they were outdated and not available now.  I stayed because I was super hungry and not willing to go anywhere else at the time.  I got the gyro, which I had never had until this point, and noticed that the meat was coming from a box straight from the freezer.  It is a small miracle I had a gyro again after this.  I've had the beef and chicken shawarma before this order and was okay with them but once again very inexperienced in this arena.  I think after the last experience I will not return seeing as how more and more shawarma joints are opening up."}
{"text":"Today in my flyers got a flyer for this place Shawarma House. They had coupons on the flyer that says valid until September 30/13. Now when I got there the girl at cash register refused to take there coupon. Told me it says NOT valid until September 30/13. I said no it expires on September 30/13. It says valid UNTIL September 30/13. She then asks the cook she also says you have a coupon not valid until September 30/13. I couldn't believe that they couldn't understand there own coupon! Both ladies refused to except my valid coupon. I said your willing to lose my business cause your refusing my valid coupon? The cook said yes cause she makes lots of business and is not worried! Couldn't believe it. My son and I left and went to eat at a restaurant who appreciate my business. Went to Pamier Kabob. Little more expensive but excellent quality food and great service. I don't know about others but me I give my money to businesses that appreciate me giving them my hard earned money. You will see if you ever have the misfortune of going to this Shawarma House the place is a small unkept stuffy place not a big restaurant either. So here expect cheap food with cheap service. You get what you pay for. If you do have there coupons just remember before you go that they refuse to honor them, which only says they have them given out in the flyers to lure you in there then refuse to honor them. Very dishonest business."}
{"text":"Out of all the shawarma places in Mississauga and Brampton this place is by far the worst! I ordered through skip the dishes; took them 10 mins just to confirm the order and another 30 mins to put the order together! I asked for a substitute of Greek salad instead of garden salad and still got garden salad which wasn't even a real garden salad. I got 4 potatoes, watered down (probably canned) hummus and spicy tahini, everything was horrible. Needless to say I threw it out after 3 bites, stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"The previous yelper does not know how lucky they are, at least they did not get any food. I used to know the owner when he ran the convenience store in the same plaza, so I thought I would check this place out.

I have had shawarmas all over the world, and this hands down is the worst shawarma. There was a funny taste and smell emanating from this food (calling it a shawarmas send wrong). Maybe they have got better, but with so many better places to choose from, I will not be back."}
{"text":"My order (Chicken Shawarma with Fries) consisted of disappointing soggy fries, chicken that was both too heavily spiced and too dry, and an underwhelming garlic sauce that was of insufficient quantity to cover almost any of the fries (which really needed it)."}
