{"text":"Every time I'm back in Cleveland, I drag a crew to Stevenson's for:

Best burger I've had anywhere in the country, hands greasily down. 

If you bring along a woman and she complains, you're with the wrong woman."}
{"text":"located in an old livery.  staff and clientele are just barely interested in being there - which is just fine, cause the burgers are fresh and good and the fries are fresher. Ordered, sliced and fried.  price is right.  Food is fresh.  Livery is well lived."}
{"text":"Well... The when the reviewer said they were like aldi burgers said that,I thought that's not bad.  We buy Aldi burger all the time.  I didn't realize he meant the pre-made patty frozen burgers, and he is right.  There is nothing special about the burgers other than they are cheap.   They really are not very good.
French fries on the other hand, I liked a lot, but you have to like fries with the skin on them.  My husband didn't like them because of that.
When you walk in the joint you are hit with a musty mildew smell, it's pretty gross, but my nose did adjust after a while.  Just warning you."}
{"text":"There are only a few things you need to know about this place:
- Best burger on the east side or in all of Cleveland for that matter (won a contest).
- Order must be a shrimp basket, followed by the famous Big Guy with an ice cold Dortmunder (all for around 8-10 bucks).
- There is no heat/ac so dress appropritly. 
- Bathrooms are made for selective use.
- Tom Tuccillo (Justin Tuccillo's dad) had his bachelor party here.
- Be careful bringing women in here. They may complain."}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER IN CLEVELAND.  hands down.

yes, it's part liquor store.  and dark. and a little run down. 

but the burgers are cheap, and incredible.

and they've got some great old arcade games.

Do yourself a favor and stop by this place."}
{"text":"I have lived in or close to euclid my entire life and it took me 27 years to make it to this divey burger joint. This is a beer/wine only bar but the burgers make up for that. I came here for lunch with my fianc√©, we both had a cheeseburger ($3 for one of the best burgers I've ever had +a nickle to add onions). I had two Great Lakes Dortmunders, she had a Yuengling, the bill plus tip was less than $20. I would heartily recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good burger and a quaint( divey) atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why you haven't been here yet. 

Their burgers are all like $3.00 and they're seriously bomba$$. (and LOLZ @ the reviewer that said they tasted \"leathery and like they were from Aldi's\" --- WUT????) 

I tried the fries this time -- fresh cut and they couldn't have been tastier. 

Get your ass to Stevenson's and have yourself a cheeseburger party."}
{"text":"Lets just get to the point.

You don't come to Stevenson's for beer or the vintage bowling machine. You come for the burgers. My first experience was last summer. My friend who doubles as the area's Miller rep swore by this place and brought a group of us there. You walk in and think to yourself \"the rumors must be a joke\". Even my parents thought this upon entry. But...books...covers...no judgment here.

We all ordered burgers and fries. I was immediately mesmerized by Bruce. The quiet yet friendly owner will take your order and go straight to the old school flattop grill on the other side of the bar. He cooks everything right in front of you. What I was pumped about was the fresh cut fries. Potato - inserted in the gizmo - smack down on the lever = fries. Everything was delicious! 

The rumors are true. Cheap eats. Great burgers. Chill old school atmosphere. See for yourself!"}
{"text":"Leathery burger, meat tastes like it was from aldis."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I am marrying a native Euclid boy, and he brought me here not long after we first started dating.  I was a bit puzzled-the place certainly isn't much to look at, the owner isn't the friendliest type, and it is just a tiny little dive bar.  But their burgers are INCREDIBLE.  They are juicy and delicious, and crazy cheap.  The \"Little Guy\" is not so little-it's only called that because it is a single patty, but it's about a quarter pound cheeseburger.  My fiance normally gets the \"Big Guy\" and it is a huge delicious double cheeseburger-too much for me though.  Anyway, I highly recommend the burgers, the fries are delicious, and the prices are great.  These are probably the best burgers on the east side of Cleveland.  I'm pretty sure the bar doesn't serve liquor, but who cares?  Come for a burger and a beer, be prepared for a place that's safely in the dive category, and enjoy a good meal for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a tiny kid. Great burgers, good beer. Love, love, love it!"}
{"text":"This is a run down little bar with an awesome, greasy burger. If you order fries, the nice lady behind the counter grabs a potato, sticks it in an old school press, pulls the handle, and bam, perfect little fries. Bonus that they have Great Lakes on tap and a bowling machine. I hate to use the term 'mom and pop', but that is literally what this is (pop was making the burgers), guess I'll be driving to Euclid more often."}

a cheeseburger sign 

As long as I can remember, and actually since 1920, the Stevenson's Hamburger sign intrigued me, but I never made it until today. Having heard great things about their burgers here and there, the time had come. 

The building, originally a livery, is all bowed and crooked and crazy looking. I'm guessing it has not changed too much in it's decor. A dozen old school bar stools, a couple formica tabletops screwed to antique brass caped wooden claw feet. Approximately 12 different types of random chairs. All good, no issues. Stevenson's, especially the floor, has a distinct \"gritty\" feel. Not in a bad way though. 

Onto the food. The menu features all of the standard deep fried appetizers and the like. I went directly for the cheeseburger, fries and onion rings. Onion rings were pretty standard, but also they were fried just right. Just. Right. 
The fries are cut to order. Malt vinegar is on the table. Can't beat that, but they tended to be limp. Had the Belgian \"2 dip in the fryer\" method been used, I bet the results would be insanely good. I'm saying this only because their fryer gets a lot of use, and the fry cook knows his/her stuff. Nothing was greasy and the oil had no outputting taste. 

The hamburger. Nice size. Fresh good bun, A+ pickle slices -super delicious. Lettuce/Tomato/Onion all thick, fresh and crunchy. A really tasty tomato considering it is April in Ohio. 
And here's the part I wish was different. The meat was the weak link to an otherwise great burger. Pretty standard industrial grade ground beef. Oh well. It was still OK. And it was only about 4 bucks. 


Carry on."}
{"text":"What a weird experience.....maybe unique is a better way of explaining it.  Anyway, here's how my lunch today went.

Planned on meeting a friend here for lunch because I just HAD to stop in for one of these burgers and the fact that I've driven by so many times in complete disbelief that a restaurant / bar could actually exist in this tiny shed of a place.

Rolled in for 11:45 lunch on a decent Wednesday, expected maybe 3-4 cars, but mine was the 2nd to arrive, my friends was the 3rd, and the owner was the 4th, coming straight from the grocery store.  I was even nice enough to hold the rickety front door open for him.  We exchanged pleasantries as my friend already knew the guy but made it clear that it was my first time at Stevenson's......ha ha ha....we all had a good laugh about not being such a thing....yadayadayada....Silver Bullett was playing on the small tv, no volume.

Bar was dark, no lights but the one above the bar and one above the cooking station we on, or at least it seemed that way.  The musty scent is there but expected since this is NOT my first dive nor will it be my last. The lady working the bar took our drink order and gave us a couple to look at the menu.  This thing is funny, straight up dive bar food with dive bar prices, both qualities in my book.  We both ordered a burger and shared a fry ($1.50).   Let me note that the surface that the burger was cooked on was spotless and the fry oil smelled and looked acceptable.

Fries are fresh cut, literally does it right in front of you, and are really good to great.  Smaller cut so its not overly oily / soggy from being under cooked.  They come unseasoned which I liked cause the salt and pepper in front of me supplied me with all the seasoning I needed.  What surprises me is that there's not a following for just the fries.

On to the burgers.  The meat is pre-pattied and frozen but not the freezer burnt kind you find in the big box, where its more of a off white / pink color.  No so here.  The meat had a great color to it, good start to a good burger.  I ordered my burger with mushrooms and bacon, both came to the flat top fresh, not precooked, not canned, where I was honestly thinking that the mushrooms HAD to be out of a can.  Pleasantly surprised to see the rest of the burger staging veggies were all fresh or at least looked it.    

Bobbo ordered his with grilled onion and bacon but somehow the bacon got skipped probably because he mumbled it under his breath and she never wrote it down.  He really liked his, especially because he was able to wash it down with a beer, me a water (wiping a single tear).  Not so long of a story a little shorter, we both inhaled our burgers and polished the fries off,  not a problem. 

So I am comparing this to my experience eating dive bar burgers and not to the burger driven joints like B-Spot, Kirtland City, Flip-Side, etc.  I think it rates up there as being one of the best and the cheapest.   As long as you can feng shui past the appearance of the bar, I really do recommend stopping in for a burger and fries.  I'll be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"Okay...4 stars for a 1 star looking spot. Let me explain, this is the definition of a dive bar, no liqueur, old box tv, no matching chairs, dark, dingy, and just straight up old school. The sign says they've been in business since 1920 and they haven't changed a thing since, maybe just the fry oil. On a flat top no bigger than my cooktop at home they bang out burgers and sandwiches that are amazing. I HATE burgers and fried food so I was a bit scared...saw the menu and was pleasantly surprised by a grilled chicken sandwich, added pickle for $0.10. It was awesome, it was marinaded in light Italian dressing with a little basil and garlic! Couldn't ask for more for $4.10! He had a \"big guy\" double cheese burger with lettuce, pickle, tomato and \"special sauce\". Loved it, he said if it was a single he wouldn't have been as happy because the fresh veggies wouldve taken away from the meat! We split an order of fresh cut fries and I mean FRESH, right in front of you potato in the machine and BAM! Fries! Right into the fryer they go. All in all, we dig it, don't expect much and you will like the simplicity of the food. Two Thirsty Dogs and a Yuengling for me and we were out of there for $19! Can't beat it...if you can get over the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"STEVENSONS, formerly a \"Euclid Icon\", has moved to Cleveland. A mainstay for a good burger and fries. A bit of a \"one trick pony\", but consistent. While previously enjoying the iconoclastic status, it might have a challenge if put up against \"real\" competition. While winning a contest many years ago, some say that the quality of the burgers has changed.

Recently Stevensons has relocated in a pre-existing business and now features a full bar, which was lacking from the previous location on Lakeshore Blvd. in Euclid. (A genuine loss for Euclid.) 

Overall, still a good choice for burger & fries. I always found the original location charming, but problematic due to structural problems, as of late. Not quite the character as the old place.

Curious that \"Wiimpy\" is the bars mascot, but it is now Stevensons 2.0"}
{"text":"New location (E200 St across from Drub Mart plaza) is somewhat hard to spot.  The food remains the same - great burgers, homemade fries and an awesome array of all things fried (mozzarella sticks, poppers, onion rings, mushrooms.)  

It's bigger, brighter, and needs a some personalization to get the old Stevenson's ambience back but I'm glad they're up and running again!"}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by the outside -- worn-out shack -- or the inside -- dark, cramped, looking something like a bar you'd find near a fishing lake that dried up and took the business with it.

It's beer only, and a limited menu -- but the burgers are the best in town. Juicy, beefy, overstuffed with toppings. Fries are first-rate. Take one of the few tables or sit down at the counter and enjoy."}
{"text":"Still freaking great!  My favorite burger place, hands down!!  Don't let the value fool you, the food actually should be priced higher, but this is a classic dive secret....if you haven't been there before or know someone who has recommeded it, you probably would pass right by it by not noticing it or because you would think it wouldn't be worth it!  Come on, the place won best burger in the News-Herald newspaper.... which is funny because the News-Herald is typically a Lake County publication (it does cover neighboring counties in some areas) but this place is in Cuyahoga County, that should tell you something.  Bruce and crew are still doing a great job!!"}
