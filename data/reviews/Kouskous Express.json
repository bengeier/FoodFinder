{"text":"Lamb cous cous was great and reasonably priced.  Choice of vegetables and sauce allows customization.  However, the eggplant is so good, I might not choose any other vegetable.  The roasted shallot hummus could be a tasty meal in itself."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I don't often find places to eat with multiple options, but Kouskous Express has enough for me to eat every day for a week and still not get bored! The food is delicious - in particular, the roasted shallot hummus is too good for this world. I need to eat it all."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  Every component of the two bowls we got was delicious individually - when tasted all together, even better.  I could just eat a giant bowl of either the Moroccan Carrots or the Ras El Hanout Cauliflower.  The chef/owner was so engaging and nice, too."}
{"text":"Wow. Everything is light and flavorful! You can create your own bowl of rice/couscous/beans with meat and vegetables complete with a sauce. You can even have it delivered! The pita was fluffy and the hummus was light and creamy. Delicious, will be back!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to Mt. Lebanon.  Delicious Moroccan food at a reasonable price.  Have been twice and both times, food was excellent.  The first time, I had braised lamb, which was not on the menu, but was so good.  The second time I had the beef with plums.  Tender beef in a savory plum gravy.  I had the saffron cream with both meals and it was wonderful. All the vegetables we equally tender, flavorful and delicious.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A fantastic example of a mom and pop restaurant doing things correctly. In a fast casual style similar to Chipotle, you can move down the line ordering multiple options of starches and proteins. Their sauces are flavorful and exotic. Their meat will melt in your mouth. Their hummus will have you leaving with two extra take out containers full of deliciousness.  You will be a regular in no time.  One taste and you'll be hooked forever."}
{"text":"This is DELISH! Love the bowl options. It's delicious, healthy, fast, and friendly! I aim to make it a regular stop!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is basically a fancier Chipotle, but Moroccan. The menu is very simple, but allows for lots of distinct dishes. If you are eating with friends or family, I recommend that you get the hummus bowl with pita and roasted peppers."}
{"text":"Wow. Well I'm at a loss for words. This is by far the freshest, most flavorful restaurant maybe in the city of Pittsburgh. My sister and I met the owner and enjoyed learning about the food and the business. He was friendly and kind and his product is unreal. Lifetime customer."}
{"text":"We were huge fans of the owner's old restaurant.  We were excited to hear he was re-opening but nervous about whether and \"express\" would be as good.  No worries.  It was, and at about half the cost.  Salmon and Merguez sausage to die for.  Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"I heard praises from friends and neighbors of the old place and was intrigued at the possibility of Moroccan in Mt. Lebanon. Decided to get two orders both couscous with saffron cream sauce, one with chicken kebab, carrots and cauliflower, the other chickpeas, cauliflower and eggplant. We got roasted shallot hummus and pita on the side. It was excellent. We will be back again to try the other permutations. Such good food for a newly opened place and the service was quite good. A great addition to Mt Lebanon's food scene."}
{"text":"This is a reincarnation from the wonderful Kouskous Cafe.  Call it \"fast-casual\", but it is really good!  I loved how you can choose your own ingredients in the bowl.  And everything tastes really great.  The Cauliflower was awesome.  Just opened, so still a little limited menu but looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Haven't stopped thinking about how delicious this food was since I went! I'm kinda upset that I didn't make a harder effort to go sooner. The setup is explained nicely by some other reviewers--fast casual, chipotle style. The chef/owner helped me create the best combo of ingredients. He and the staff were helpful in answering any questions. Fresh, wholesome food. Clean restaurant. Quick. And absolutely delicious! ( i got couscous, lamb, eggplant, squash/zucchini, chickpea sauce....and the cilantro garnish at the end just stole my heart lol)"}
{"text":"Much of the same great food I loved so much as Kous Kous. The beef with plum on saffron rice with saffron cream sauce is AMAZING! Highly recommended despite being in a borough I usually refuse to do business in."}
{"text":"The beef with plums was fantastic! I'm looking forward to trying more options in the future. The staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"Very good, fast, and BYOB!  We had the beef in plums and the lamb, and the Moroccan beets, Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Mt. Lebanon. The food was excellent and at a very good price. I would highly recommend the lamb tagine and saffron rice."}
{"text":"Wow, if only more people knew about the incredible flavors and heavenly odors of this cuisine. Moroccan food has all the right moves to immediately make it your next favorite pastime. Healthy... check!  Delicious....mmmmmm check!  Inexpensive... yup, check again!  Addicting... oh check!  Your mouth is watering and your brain is grinding isn't it?  How have you missed this?  How have you never experienced?  You're now entrapped in a sickening game of FOMO!!!  Better get some of this straight to your face,  ASAP!  I prefer the lamb with couscous and veggie, spicier the better."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Delicious, fresh and friendly. Had Salmon/couscous/carrots/cauliflower/saffron cream, natch! Thank goodness this is here in Lebo now!"}
{"text":"Wonderful and delicious....made from scratch everyday.  This is the way home cooked food should taste....simple and good."}
{"text":"I loved the original restaurant and love this new incarnation. This is much different: much more casual and much friendlier to the wallet. The food is still delicious. As a sidebar, I had a Weight Watchers friendly meal here: chicken kabob with eggplant and zucchini over beans with harissa sauce. Fantastic!! The woman told us the harissa was very spicy but I thought it was just right. We plan to eat here regularly."}
{"text":"My friends insisted we try this place on the strength of the owner's previous restaurant. I'm very glad they did. The food was terrific! I had the salmon over jasmine rice with cauliflower and eggplant, all topped with cream sauce. We're definitely going back tomorrow, but I'm struggling to figure out whether I should get exactly the same thing or something completely different. The service was great and the food was unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Excellent melding of flavors. Each ingredient is FRESH...big time. Example - All the beans are clearly NOT from a can, but dried. This much such a difference in flavor and texture. The carrots are fresh, perfectly cut and perfectly cooked. The sauces are rich and deeply flavorful. I cannot recommend this place strongly enough for consistency and quality."}
{"text":"Couple things to note while reading this review: First, I have not eaten the food here, which I've been told is very good. Second, this is my first public review of a restaurant and downloaded yelp just to share my experience. I recently visited kouskous for the first time and received very poor service. I initially attempted to place an order by phone. I called three times with no answer. Finally, after an employee did answer I was asked to be placed on hold. This lasted 10 minutes, at which point I had already arrived at the restaurant as this entire process lasted from when I took the banksville exit from the parkway (which I assumed would be ample time to at least place my order for what is described as a \"fast casual\" restaurant). When I entered the restaurant there were 3 people in line. Two of the menu items that the customer in front of me ordered, carrots and beets, were sold out. Another customer entered the restaurant after me and was helped before me as apparently I wasn't standing in the correct spot, at which point I left. I feel I was given extremely poor service which is too bad as I was very excited to eat here, but feel there is no excuse for poor customer service and employees that are unaware and can't handle 4 customers at a time, in which again is supposed to be \"fast casual\" dining. Feel this place has a lot to improve on."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch during a weekday. It was my first time at Kouskous Express. The staff was very helpful in explaining all of the options and what options compliment each other from a flavor perspective. They have three different options for your base of the bowl. There are numerous protein options and various toppings! With the staff's help, I was able to construct a very delicious Moroccan bowl! The flavors were unique and I definitely enjoyed a delicious lunch!  The only reason I took a star away from my review is that it is a pricy lunch option for the amount of food you get. Other than the price, I don't have any complaints!  I would return in the future to give it another shot and try a new combination!"}
{"text":"So glad that Chef Khila is back but on the express side (fast and casual).  Missed his restaurant. First - Pick a base of Couscous, Saffron Rice or Pita Wrap Second - Pick a Protein Third- Pick 2 Veggies from Moroccan Carrots, Eggplant Zaulouk or Ras El Hanout Cauliflower Fourth - Pick a sauce from Couscous Chickpea or Saffron cream or Vegan Tomato  Delicious easy meal."}
{"text":"You have to taste the food here: EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!!!!! From the sides, as the weekly hummus ( this week the roasted shallots is incredible) to the marinated salmon  and the beef with plums!!!! Uhmmmmm, it's a pleasure have dishes like these so fresh and so close to home!!!! I'm dreaming with our next tasteful journey..."}
{"text":"The food is freshly made. Chicken, lamb, beef and salmon on the menu but you may opt for only veggies. Fresh hummus, salad and pita make a lighter lunch. The chickpea sauce has a nice little kick but the harissa delivers a little after burn which is pleasant without being overbearing. The staff is very nice. The only negative is visiting on a cold day, the place is quite chilly and each time the door opens it becomes worse. I prefer to eat with my coat off so next time I will go when it is not snowing. And there will be a next time!!!"}
{"text":"Moroccan food.. Chipotle style. Simple menu. Really good meat. However felt it was a little costly!"}
{"text":"Went the other day with my aunt for lunch.  It's in the old My Big Fat Greek Gyro / Simple Greek location.  Interior is the same, and was very clean.    Unfortunately they were out of beef with plums, so I didn't get to try it.  I had the saffron rice with lemon chicken, two veg, and the saffron cream sauce.  It was really good, but not gonna lie, I REALLY wanted to try the beef with plums because of other yelp reviews.    Overall, a good meal, very quiet for a weekday lunch, clean, and not outrageously priced.  Not a whole lot to review, but I know I'll definitely go back."}
