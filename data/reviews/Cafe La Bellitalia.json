{"text":"I really like this place! Nice atmosphere, pretty good service, and great food. The space is smallish (about 15 tables), and you might have a wait on a weekend night, but they move quick enough. 

The food is really good and the portions are more than enough. We've tried several pastas (the carbonara is fantastic), the eggplant and the chicken parmigiana, and some seafood dishes. Always consistently tasty. I really like the red sauce - flavorful and slightly sweet, which is up my alley. 

Good place for an easy, casual meal. Family friendly but also good for a date, somehow. I believe they deliver, too."}
{"text":"Overall, our party had a great time here.  We loved the atmosphere, our waitress was great, and the wine was quite good.   The dish I ordered, however, had to be one of the saltiest concoctions I've ever eaten and was almost inedible.    So don't try the Pasta Puttanesca - not that anyone would anyway.    

The Eggplant Parmigiana was very good, and we ordered seconds on garlic bread due to excessive deliciousness.   

As far as I can tell, just stay away from the dish I tried and Bellitalia will treat you well."}
{"text":"I ordered the veal marsala and my coworker ordered stuffed eggplant. The eggplant was really good but the veal was over cooked and very tough to chew. Service was fair at best. She gave us silverware 3 minutes after serving the meal and we kept having to ask for more water."}
{"text":"Oh my can't RAVE this one enough. Came to Madison for 1 night looked around for  \"out of the way\" places stumbled across this one. Sherry was our waitress... ^5 Sherry. Asked what was good and she pointed out some great options. We were not told about some specials. Husband and I were celebration our 17 years of marriage. 

Hubby ordered Chicken Marsala and he loved every ounce of it.... BTW he's not a big Italian food guy. I ordered Chicken Alfredo.... very good as well. We has STELLAR service as promised by Sherry. Very attentive and a wonderful server.... tell her Milwaukee told you about her. :)  

After we were done with dinner we were surprised with a most WONDERFUL piece of Tiramisu. I have eaten a lot of this dessert but hands down this was the BEST!!! Very high quality and very flavorful... it was so good I closed my eyes and let it melt away slowly. 

Hands down the best food from Milwaukee to Madison.

{"text":"Love this place. Family-run, family-friendly neighborhood Italian restaurant. Their take-out/delivery is so-so in my experience, so dine in--I've never had a bad meal. Their red sauce is distinctive and the pasta tastes home-made--no corners cut, nothing from a can, so far as I can tell. Warm, friendly atmosphere. Occasionally they have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. I've always gone with my 3yo in tow, and they've always been patient and kind with him. Excellent place for parents who want a civilized meal at a place where their kids will be welcome."}
{"text":"Like the other reviews said don't judge a book by its cover.  The place is simple and lets you feel comfortable.

The food:

Bosco sticks w/ marinara sauce: very delicious. Crispy on the outside with ooey gooey mozzarella the middle.

Lobster ravioli w/ vodka sauce with mozzarella cheese on top:
Kinda greasy or maybe it was just from the vodka sauce. Either way it was delicious. Came out piping hot and smelled amazing. I woulf definetly return and try some other appetizing meals on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food, good wine, good service. Old school italian fair, with an old school atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very cozy with a great atmosphere. The food is spectacular, especially when compared to the other Italian options in the area. Chicken Marsala and Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo are some of our favorites. If you are looking to enjoy a nice Italian meal, you will not be disappointed. The only opportunity for improvement is with the small parking lot."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight. They asked if we had a reservation, we had none but they made room for the 6 of us. The food was great along with great service! I had the gnocchi, have never had it before but it was great. Others had spaghetti and angle hair pasta with shrimp, all were great! Staff was very pleasant and seemed to be genuinely happy to be serving us. Only bad thing was the air conditioning it was blowing directly on us, waitress was very happy to change the airflow so it was not as bad. Will go back but will make reservation away from air conditioner."}
{"text":"Wow! never expected this place to be so good because of it's slightly odd location. We decided to visit this place only because we had gone to the Botanical Gardens. But now, even though we live on the west side of the town, we will come here again.

Upside: Great food, not too cheesy, nice interior decor, has a family feel to it. Service was very good. 

Downside: Location, portion size slightly less, small place so expect to wait for sometime on a busy weekend evening.

Overall: Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good price, fast friendly delivery, and the delivery person had a milk-bone for my barking dog. I don't know what the Bellitalians could have done to impress me any more."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the food is always very good, very warm and very filling. The staff and the owner are always welcoming and try their best to make sure your experience is one of a kind!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst restaurant food I have ever eaten in my life. This is not an exaggeration. I have only reviewed a few other restaurants on Yelp, but this was so bad I felt compelled to warn future customers. I am from out of town, so I only went off of the fact that they delivered and were rated one of the top five Italian restaurants in Madison. I ordered the sampler, which includes spaghetti with one meatball, chicken parm, and lasagna. First off, it came in a large round foil dish with everything mixed together. You could literally not even find the lasagna in the dish. The consistency of the chicken parm was as if someone had breaded a thin piece of rubber and fried it. The meatball had no flavor. As far as the marinara, you'd be better suited going to the grocery store and buying a jar of Ragu."}
{"text":"We came here after finding a Bucky Book coupon for $10 off. We were a bit apprehensive at first since there was a single open parking spot when we arrived, but the parking lot must just be small because we had no wait when we got inside. We started off with garlic bread, which was decent. A table next to us ordered the bruschetta and it looked amazing, so next time we'll be getting that instead. My husband and his father split a pizza and both of them said it was delicious. The right mix of cheese/sauce and toppings. I had the veal parmigiana, which was yummy. The breading got a bit soggy since it was also covered in spaghetti sauce. But the sauce had a good sweet flavor and the veal had a nice spice level to it.

The service wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular. Our server just lacked personality, but was quick with refills on water and beer and the prices were reasonable considering the amount/quality of the food. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful owner and staff.  We always feel welcome and enjoy the food.  Our favorite is the gnochi, but we substitute the vodka sauce.  the first time we came the waiter recommended it that way and we were hooked.  The garlic bread is good and the cheese bread even better.  

The bruschetta is good and also have enjoyed other special starters.  One was fresh mozzarella and prosciutto with fresh basil and basalmic glaze.  Yummy.

We have also enjoyed the veal parmigiania and the baked shells as well as the delicious pasta carbonara.  mmmmm

The pizza is also something special.  The crust is crisp and the toppings generous.  

The tiramisu is very good as well.

The hours are great as we like to eat late.  We have brought a number of friends here and they also all enjoyed it.  To top it off, the prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in town!  I love this place.  Everything about it was great--the family style ma and pop feeling of it, and the service and food.  I would come back just for the server we had--and I told her and her manager just that!  I HIGHLY recommend this eatery.  The other great thing about it is that it's gluten friendly, and still incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"Was looking for an Italian place after Badger fb that was away from craziness and offered gluten free. This was a great place thanks to Yelp reviews. Friendly staff. Attentive. Reasonably priced. Great variety to choose from. Came out hot, full of flavor and generous portion."}
{"text":"Actual restaurant is small, but if you go at the right time you can always find a table. I frequently have there pizza delivered. I would consider the pizza to be one of the best around. 

Excellent place on the north side!"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on a review from Yelp. You have to eat here. It doesn't look like much on the inside, but it's the best pizza in town. Whether its deep dish or thin crust, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I added an extra star because I am very grateful to have a delicious restaurant on the northside (in addition to Banzo and Manna).  I would still make a trip here if it wasn't close by.  All off their pasta and gnocchi that I have tried are wonderful. The sauces are perfect and the garlic bread is pretty good too.  The prices are a tad high (I am also a tad cheap) but it doesn't stop me from enjoying it every now and then.  I have always ordered take out which was quite fast."}
{"text":"Their food is decent but nothing to write home about. However, I placed a delivery order and was told it would arrive within 45 minutes. When It hadn't arrived in an hour and fifteen minutes, I called back. They said they couldn't deliver downtown but never bothered to call back. THEIR FOOD ISN'T NEARLY GOOD ENOUGH TO COMPENSATE FOR THE RUDENESS AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Best chicken parm! Nice little place stopped on a whim and I am very happy. The sauce was delish"}
{"text":"I was in Madison on business, and saw that this place had great reviews. I decided to get a pizza and salad for carry out, and I was impressed the minute I walked into the restaurant.  The strong garlic and cheese aroma made me feel at home, and the smiling/pleasant staff we very helpful.
The pizza was by far the best I've had in a while.  It was obvious that it was hand-made and cooked in an old fashioned oven with fresh ingredients.
I wish that I lived in the area, because this place has spoiled me with quality food at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Service, while friendly, was very slow and inattentive. I don't think we'd have a gotten a refill all night without asking for it, and several tables seated after us were served and received their meals first. I got the impression that other servers were better, and the problem was ours in particular and not the restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in town!  I love the mom and pop feel, and the food is excellent.  Generous portions, and delicious sauce makes any pizza or pasta dish a great choice every time.   Can get a little cramped at times, especially at dinner, but also a great place for lunch, and there are worse problems than being so good that lots of people want to eat there.  Service never disappoints either and the prices are very reasonable.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place sure beats the large chain restaurants featuring \"Italian\" food. Amazing fresh sauces and huge helpings! The waitstaff has always been extremely helpful, patient and thorough and they did not disappoint when our larger party booked a table for a birthday. They accommodated our needs by adjusting the ac vents for us and served us exactly what we ordered and all special requests met. I was very impressed with their prices, too! For this high quality food and service, I expected it to be much pricier. Our party of eight totaled just under $100. Awesome deal considering you have a take home portion for lunch the next day. 
My only criticism is the dining area's tight space. It's no bigger than it was back when it was Rick'N Ole's. But it was and will be worth it for us. Good food for a good price."}
{"text":"First time trying this place.  Ordered for delivery (free). They said 45 mins - got there in 27! Friendly delivery person. Food hot.
I had spag & meatball. Authentic taste. Yum!
Friend had The Works thin pizza. She said it was as good as it looked.
We'll definately try them again soon."}
{"text":"Old school pasta dishes; the pasta is always al dente, the sauce is a basic, rustic sweeter Style tomato sauce and the portions ensure that you will not leave that place hungry. Very cozy, neighborhood feel"}
{"text":"Never wouldve thought this place was as good as it is, but they say you can't judge a book by its cover...This place is one of Madison's Gems! Amazing personable staff, great atmosphere with low romantic lighting at night. The size of the restaurant may be small but they've created a homey feel out of it. The food is by far the best Italian I've eaten in Madison, It is right up there with the best NY Italian Cuisine Ive had in Little Italy. These people know their stuff, the Shrimp Ravioli is the best as is the Sampler platter with the sausage, lasagna and chicken par. I will continue to go there again and again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place with friends and co-workers while they were still serving lunch; it seems this may have stopped. The place was packed with people who appeared to be nearby employees. I had a large slice of pizza and a salad. The salad was unremarkable, made with iceberg lettuce. Pizza was very large and floppy but sometimes that's my craving. Italian sausage was tasty, crunchy on top.

Vinyl table coverings were sticky, not enough silverware for our number of diners after food arrived. To me, that's the low hanging fruit. Staff were scampering around as if they had just opened or were new hires. They were difficult to flag down. We selected the simplist menu item that I assumed was prepared ahead of time, but it still took 1.5 hrs to get out of there. I would return if a friend really had their heart set on this but I wouldn't seek it out myself."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful traditional family Italian restaurant. Nothing fancy just great good food. Many varieties of ravioli. The marinara is great as are the homemade meatballs. The repeat customers are a tribute to just how great this place is. Did I mention garlic bread comes with every entree. Now i did"}
{"text":"this a restaurant that has never let us down. penne a la vodka. pizza. spaghetti. even their sandwiches are delicious. I have to admit, their pizza is what I prefer to order.  love this place"}
{"text":"I love this place! It always feel like you're eating with friends in this cozy, cute restaurant. Great prices and generous portions of good food!"}
{"text":"Not the worst pizza but definitely not very good. The crust isn't very thin and everything is just fair. The quest for good pizza in madison continues"}
{"text":"horrible ...pizza crust was rock hard no sauce toppings looked old I am sad to say this was the worst pizza i have ever had :("}
{"text":"When I walked into this restaurant it seemed very comforting, like you would be at home.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  

We were hoping to have the fried ravioli as our appetizer, but they were out, so pizza bread was our next option.  The pizza bread was what you would expect.  It wasn't bad at all,  but just nothing out of the ordinary.  

I ordered the veal ravioli for my entree.  The raviolis were quite large, sauce had a nice flavor and came out piping hot just the way i like it, and the meat was tender and not overpowered by the sauce.  I thought it was a really good dish. My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti carbonara, which was awesome!  It taste like \"breakfast\" with spaghetti noodles.  If you're a bacon lover, this would be the perfect dish because it has such a great bacon flavor to it.   We had seven people in our party and everyone was satisfied by their meal except for my brother who ordered tortellini with white sauce.  The two items just didn't mixed well together because it was too creamy and cheesy.  The dish would have worked better as a side or the tortellini would have been balanced better with a red sauce."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and this restaurant was one of the few open New Years Day. 

The waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and worked in the kitchen so had some great recommendations. My boyfriend loved the eggplant parm and I had the chicken vesuvio. The portions were just right and the garlic bread was soft and yummy. 

I've never had bruschetta on soft bread before!"}
{"text":"this is a small quaint little-known gem on the upper side of madison.

i had dinner here last night with my beau, my sister and her husband.  it was recommended by my sister's co-worker and i'm glad we ended up going there.  

i had the spaghetti ala carbonara which was really good (even second-day, as leftovers).  it was a huge portion (two meals worth) and full of bacon-y, egg-y, cheese-y goodness.  the sig o had ravioli portabella which i tried a bit of and it too was very good.  the house red sauce that topped it was a little sweet which actually made it rather delicious.  my sister's spaghetti matarocco looked pretty good and her husband completely finished off his lasagna (he remarked wanting to get the recipe when he was through -- he liked it so much!).

the atmosphere was quaint.  it is a small space so it's not very fancy -- but they manage to fit a number of tables in little room so i give them credit.  

service was good.  food was good.  nice atmosphere.
would recommend as a great little spot for italian and would definitely go back again.

strong 4-stars!

*note* there is no website for this place, but an old menu can be found  here: http://www.menupix.com/madison/restaurants.php?id=730090#
the menu has been updated since, but it's fairly the same."}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe La Bellitalia quite a few times in the last several years. The food is consistently amazing! It is my go-to Italian restaurant in Madison.
If you are looking for reasonably priced quality Italian meal with huge portions, Cafe Bellitalia is your place!
I can personally recommend the vodka sauce. I crave it on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian food, this is the place!  Skip OG. It's also great that they deliver, but I'm guessing food is even better if you dine in. Awesome meatballs, calamari and pasta!  GREAT customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome local Italian. Our favorite place for a romantic dinner off the beaten downtown path. If you are an Italian from the Northeast USA, this is the best red sauce Italian joint you'll find in Madison. 

In addition to the red sauce dishes, I've had the pizza and it is very good compared to the average Madison findings. 

Get the Boscoe sticks. Just do it. If you leave without the Boscoe Sticks, you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice atmosphere. I recommend the peroni beer and the carbonara, The pizza was popular was well, with a crisp thin crust. We also had the puttanesca, but my wife and I didn't like it . Maybe it was too strong for her, but I thought it needed more anchovies and hot peppers ;) 

To sum up, there is a friendly atmosphere of a family restaurant and the food is good. This is a a place for a date or special occasion, yet affordable enough for frequent visits."}
{"text":"The garlic bread was frozen. I got fettuccine Alfredo and it was terrible, it wasn't an Alfredo sauce and it was linguine. My boyfriend got the chicken Parmesan and it was soggy. We didn't eat there at all, paid for our drinks, and went to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Four hour drive home in the never ending rain. It is dark and we are tired and over hungry. We squabble over what to eat. Settle on an eggplant parmigiana pizza. As the restaurant closes, we pick up our steaming hot pie. It was \"just what the doctor ordered\". Just the right ratio of sauce, to cheese, to deliciously breaded eggplant. The crust was excellent. 
This experience gets five stars but my overall view must be a four. I have eaten here many times but some things are just uneven... Sauce too sweet, bread lacking in texture and flavor etc. 
A wonderful little hometown restaurant that hit the bullseye with that pizza. Mmmm"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an absolute gem in an area of Madison that is otherwise altogether lacking in restaurant options.  Don't be misled by the non-descript exterior or the old, faded sign.  Inside, the restaurant is charming, cozy, and the food is AMAZING!  Nice-sized menu with a large variety of both pizzas and pastas, including some less-common pasta selections that you don't see at any other Italian restaurants in Madison.  The food is always tasty and seems fresh.  I've eaten here a half dozen times and never had anything less than a 5-star experience (keeping in mind that it's not a 5-star restaurant obviously, but I nonetheless would call it a 5-star experience for what it is)."}
{"text":"Reasons you should go to Cafe La Bellitalia 
1. Stuffed shells 
2. Vodka sauce
3. Friendly service
4. wine
5. Intimate setting 
6. Desserts to die for! Especially the Tiramisu 
7. Fair prices 
8. Old school vibes"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, and it was always delicious. Their red sauce is incredible...great pizza, sandwiches, and pasta."}
{"text":"Ordered a parmigiana pizza for delivery...Hooo-leeee-shit. It was awesome. For literally the same price as a generic lump of \"cheese pizza\" from Pizza Hut I got one of the best pizzas I've ever had delivered to my home. I don't even like eggplant that much and I just fell in love with he breaded eggplant parmesan they topped it with. The cheese wasn't too greasy and they didn't slather the pizza in sauce and the crust was baked to a perfect thickness. And at $13 for a large I feel like I ripped them off.

I also ordered some pasta but I can't really remember what it tasted like or what I got. So it was probably nothing exceptional. But if I'm ever in need of a delivery pizza anytime soon I know exactly who to call."}
{"text":"Casual Italian dining. Had the sampler platter (spaghetti/manicoti) with chicken parm & Italian sausage. Portion was ample and tasty. Prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is warm, casual and a bit rustic. They also offer pizza, full appetizer menu & Italian beer!"}
{"text":"Had one of the absolute worst experiences ordering delivery from here with the Yelp eat24 app. I was really excited to try this place when the menu showed gluten free calzones, which i haven't had in a long time and usually love. I ordered around 6:20-630pm and was disappointed that it showed a delivery time of 720 but we had already picked everything out and paid before we could see that. 20min later i get a call saying they don't have gluten free calzones and asked if i was okay with a regular one. Of course not! Why would i pay extra for gluten free if i could have regular? They didn't offer any other solution. So i asked if they had gluten free pizza crusts, which they did bit said it usually costs more
And wouldn't charge me the extra $1. It's like what are you talking about i already paid for the gluten free up charge with my calzone order. Then 740 rolls around and no call and the app still showed the pizza arriving at 720. So i call and they said oh yeah it should be out soon. We got a lot of orders after yours and got slammed. No excuse for not even a courtesy call or apology. Had to call again when by 820 still no food. Same story. Finally got it around 846 and it was chewy and lukewarm. Terrible. Never ordering from here again. P.s. My husband and brother had pizzas too and said they also were really bad."}
{"text":"The food is good but when I just called in an order a turn of events left me slightly disturbed: the person on the other line did not know that spaghetti was pasta. Overall they have a nice red sauce and the chicken Parmesan is exquisite but seriously how do your employees not know that spaghetti is pasta?!?!"}
{"text":"We are really fortunate to have this little gem on Madison's lovely Northside. They remodeled the former Ole'N Rick's Northside Inn (or Rick'N Ole's, depending on which side of the sign you read) after the smoking ban was implemented in Madison in July 2005 (5 years before the statewide ban). Many critics thought bars and restaurants would not survive without their smoking patrons. Ole'N Rick's owners retired and sold their quaint space early during the smoking ban implementation. It turns out, a little Italian joint is exactly what the Northside needed, and Cafe La Bellitalia has been building their business here for the last 9 years.

We ordered takeout, and here is the lowdown:

They have great pizza, with LOADS of toppings. There's no skimpy pizza found here! We ordered an XL of The Works pizza. It was huge and tasted great! One thing we have noticed during our 13 years in Madison is that there isn't a lot of really good pizza in this town. Bellitalia is a list-topper for us. Pro tip: they sell slices over lunch on weekdays.

I was in the mood for pasta and ordered the homemade fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. It comes with a \"side\" of garlic bread, which is essentially a small loaf of Italian bread. I immediately devoured this garlic butter goodness (I rode my bike 65 miles today, so I can eat whatever I want, right?). The pasta was delicious with it's perfectly creamy sauce and they didn't hold back at all on the chicken. The portion was HUGE in the take-out container, definitely enough for two people.

We've had great experiences, both dining in and with take-out. There's always a good crowd and they seem to be doing a great business. They've certainly been a great addition to the Northside community."}
{"text":"I've lived on Madison's east side for 15 years and had never had Cafe La Bellitalia's pizza until we moved to the near north side a few months ago. Big mistake, Vick. I cannot get enough of their pizza. The fact that they deliver just makes my pizza-craving-tummy happy. This pizza is so fresh, so chock-full of great ingredients, so cheesy and delicious, I can't believe I have been missing out all these years.  This is really, really good thin crust pizza, at totally reasonable prices. AND delivered to your door by a cheerful, prompt delivery guy. I've eaten in the restaurant once, and the Italian fare is ok (let's face it, I'm really too much of a cheapskate to go OUT for spaghetti), but the pizza?! My new favorite Madison pizza."}
{"text":"This once was a favorite, and we went back after a year's absence.  It was a Friday night, so it was busy, maybe too busy for the cooks to take care in what they were doing.  I ordered Linguine with clams in white wine garlic sauce, my companion ordered penne pasta in vodka sauce with chicken.  The linguine was pretty bad.  The white sauce had red grease, how does that happen??  More than that, I could barely taste wine...no garlic.  In fact to me, it tasted like chicken broth, with onions and wine passed over it. It was soup with noodles.  The clams were ok and cooked just right.  The penne with vodka sauce was ok as well. No flavor other than sweet tomato.  Overall, none of the sauces were allowed to mature, and you couldn't taste the ingredients.  It was yucky."}
{"text":"Unacceptable. The two stars is for the food. We had spaghetti and meatballs my grandson had Mac and cheese. Both delicious. 
Apparently the host had to host wait on tables and cook!!
If you can't remember the order you should write it down. Ordered salads. Waited a very long time for our meals brought them out no salads. Told him to forget it. Half way through meal had to ask for garlic bread which was suppose to come with the meal. 
It was a terrible experience especially with a 4 year old!!!
If your sign says open please have enough staff to accommodate your customers.  Very poor management!!

I'll go down the street to Benvenutos next time."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out again for the first time in years, for a friend's birthday.  It was as good as I remembered!  I split an order of Bosco sticks with a couple other people - now those....they disappointed.  Only because I swear they must've have started them from frozen.  They were warm and crunchy on the outside, but they had COLD SPOTS on the inside.  So yeah - boooooooooo to those.  However, my spaghetti carbonara was straight up amazing!!  So, so good.  Just typing about it right now is making me drool.  I don't go out for Italian a lot, surprisingly it's just not something I usually crave - but I swear I'll be back soon just because I can't stop thinking about this dish!  The restaurant is small - so if you're going during peak hours, definitely make a reservation! You wouldn't have been able to get a seat if you tried while we were there.  The noise level is quite loud - it's not a place to sit down and have an intimate conversation.  You seriously cannot beat the prices for the food you get.  Our waitress was definitely off her game that night, but I won't fault the restaurant for that.  We'll definitely be checking them out again soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with the family, and we'll definitely be back. You see, we love good sauces, and this place nails it with every sauce. We had a nice variety of dishes, and they were all excellent - spaghetti carbonara, chicken alfredo, and two different raviolis, one with alfredo and one with marinara. If you have a chance to try their marinara, don't pass it up. It's unique and probably one of the best I've ever tasted. The alfredo was good too, but the marinara stole the show. I've been thinking about it constantly since we left! One star reduction for the garlic bread they brought to the table, though. Sure, it's free, but that shouldn't mean it has to be bland."}
{"text":"whoot whoot whoot whoot whoot I'm a fan! now if only I can get my butt in her another time for some of that pizza! Run! don't walk"}
{"text":"On average we make it over to Cafe La Bellitalia almost every week! Their food is delicious and trust me, there is NO other Italian restaurant I have eaten at in Madison that is better! From their homemade sauces to their amazing garlic bread, there is not a single dish on the menu I wouldn't recommend. The restaurant itself is quite cosy, the owner (Pietro) is always inviting and I would rate the service as 5 star (Angie is our Favorite)!! The prices are also very affordable, whether your looking to grab a quick lunch (they have great sandwiches) or a nice relaxing dinner there is plenty too choose from and you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"You know a place is awesome when it's JAM PACKED!  I don't really like eating in places that are jam packed, BUT the cheery atmosphere and laughter only added to the goodness of the food.  We ordered the artichoke heart salad and Parmigiana Pizza.  AMAZING.  I was saying \"mmm\" all the way through!

I'll definitely be back.  mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"This is a sweet and friendly neighborhood eatery. Although small in space there is always room for one more if an unexpected friend joins you for lunch. The food is tasty and moderately priced and the staff is friendly as well as efficient."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was horrible! I'm guessing that since we were using a restaurant.com coupon, and the waitress was getting her 18% gratituity added on no matter what, it was okay to not serve us the right way. She only came to the table with water and took our order and our check. She did NOT once come to the table to check on us. Saw the other waitresses coming back and fourth to check on the other tables. Had to ask to get my water refill, and it wasn't til we were about to leave that she came by with the water."}
{"text":"They have the best chicken Parmesan I've ever had and their tomato sauce is to die for. I mostly get takeout, but they are always quick and the folks at the counter are super friendly."}
{"text":"From out of state and looking for some Italian. Food was excellent, everything was hot, fresh, and delicious, generous portions!!! This was a great choice and if we are back in the area we will definitely come back!!! Service was friendly and great!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a half dozen times    I don't know why.  The food is average at best . I don't think anything is actually made there..  the vodka sauce is tasty but probably from a jar and the tiramisu is great but from a Chicago bakery.  Last time we ate there the sauce tasted metallic and burnt."}
{"text":"As an update to the below review I decided to call the restaurant and tell them about my meal last night. I told the chef  what I got  and he said it was not his lasagna and wasn't sure what it was I was served. He was going to look into it and has me down for a free meal. I wish all of the chefs and restaurant owners would look at YELP and reply to legitimate complaints like mine and try to correct the problem.


 I have always liked this small Italian restaurant but not last night. I ordered lasagna and what I got really surprised me. It was a plate of meat sauce with a bunch of cheese melted on the top and that was it. No noodles at all. I finally asked the server who was very good, if this was in fact lasagna and she said yes. It cried for noodles! Plus the sauce was way to sweet. I ordered regular bread in stead of garlic bread and it came saturated with I guess butter. You could squeeze it and this oily stuff would drip out of it. It was the worst meal I have ever had here. Is this normal or not I have to wonder. Lasagna without noodles??  To be fair my partner had another noodle dish that was very good and it did come with pasta. What a mystery."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a lucky find using Google maps for \"Italian restaurants near me\" while we were traveling home from the Dells.  By appearances,  this restaurant doesn't look like much but they live up to their Google description of a busy,  comfortable bistro with generous portions.  

We may have arrived to an empty restaurant but before we left, all the tables were full. It is definitely a local favorite and off the beaten path for most tourists. The only complaint was about the shrimp basket: Both the fries and the shrimp were overcooked. My chicken marsala was heavy on the garlic,  but I love it that way and it was served properly over pasta. Some restaurants serve marsala with spaghetti marinara on the side which is just wrong,  IMHO.

Soft drinks are served in cans; a little weird when fountains are the norm but it's one of those quirks that just makes you adore the homey character of the cafe. 

We saved room for dessert,  because who can pass up tiramisu?  This was the perfect finish to our meal.

I wish I lived closer,  but this place will be on my radar the next time I travel through Madison."}
{"text":"Gniocchi baked with marinara, mozzarella and meatball. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant on the north side of Madison. Fast delivery and friendly service.

Penne ala vodka is good, though when pastra travels it tends to get a little soft. Pizza has a decent crust with ample toppings. Their eggplant parmesan pizza is good but it's fried so there's a lot of grease. Basic pepperoni/sausage pizza does the trick and is affordable.

The highlights of the menu are anything that includes their slightly sweet red sauce, and their home-fried items. Onions rings are the best in Madison. The fried eggplant can be ordered as an appetizer, and it's enormous and delicious with their red sauce, which comes with.

Basic spagetti-with-meat-sauce absolutely kills for $7, soft delivery noodles or not, as does their spagetti-with-meatball. Can't do better in Madison for order-in lunch at these prices. 

Dinner is fairly priced and neither on the cheap or expensive side. This is more of your New Jersey big-portion of comfort food kind of Italian, in contrast to the local-farmers-market ingredients of Lombardino's or Nostrano. That said, I give Bellitalia a very high recommendation, especially for delivery."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last night after the nearby Mallards game was rained out. I ordered a glass of the house shiraz and fettucini with clams in a red sauce. My mother, a vegetarian, ordered their vegetarian pizza, minus the bell peppers (in my opinion, being a vegetarian who hates bell peppers, broccoli, and cauliflower is a bit... limiting, but she makes do).

The fettucini was cooked perfectly al dente, and the red sauce was bursting with some of my favorite things - onions and garlic. Perhaps mincing them a tiny bit smaller might have been in order, but my robust palate enjoyed them regardless. The sauce's high level of oiliness did detract from the taste, however. The clams were tender (although a select few were still gritty), and all were open. The garlic bread, on the other hand, was drab and uninspired. Cooked on an unimpressive slab of a stale roll, someone had dragged garlic butter over the sliced-open portion and called it a day. The house shiraz was fine, though, already aerated, and perfectly dry. They did remember to keep the peppers off my mom's pizza (which is far more of a rarity in Madison than it ought to be), and she was perfectly happy with its thin crust, which was the perfect mix of crispy and chewy. My mom was disappointed, though, that they used canned mushrooms on her pizza (especially since they are in season all over Madison), and from a look at other reviews, this seems to be standard practice for both the mushrooms and peppers.

The service was fine, and the decor very old-school Italian-American. The portion of fettucini I received was so large that I was able to have both a late night meal several hours later, as well as one today, from the leftovers. I look forward to trying other menu items in the future, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"We love this place. Small, quaint restaurant dishing up great Italian food. The garlic bread isn't very good which is surprising because everything else is great. The veal is a good choice and their pizzas are really good. If you can't decide I believe they have a sampler platter."}
{"text":"Our family stopped in without a reservation on a recent Friday night.  It was busy (good sign) and we were told it'd be a 15 minute wait.  There isn't a lot of room if you have to wait, so hopefully, a) you're one of only two groups waiting or b) its warm outside.  

Once we were seated, we were treated to adequate service...I like servers that are well-informed about their menu and can guide me to what is great there...we didn't get that from our waitress in terms of either the wine or food selection.

Ultimately, we settled on garlic bread (fair), baked lasagna (very good!), chicken parm (good), and baked spaghetti (good).

This isn't a place we would necessarily go out of our way for a meal, but the atmosphere is cozy and the food good.  If we find ourselves on that side of town in need of food, we wouldn't hesitate to swing by again."}
{"text":"How is this my first visit?  

First of all, please read this disclaimer: 

1. Do not go if you are posh.
2. Do not go if you do not like loud restaurants.
3. Do not go if you are expecting 5 star service.

Ok - Now that is done....

The place is great.  The smells greet you on your way in.  I was also not cranky as there is a pretty decent sized parking lot of the back of the building (a plus for Sherman Ave.).  You can call ahead and put your name in.  I would recommend it as there is no place to stand to wait (and no bar). 

There are only a couple of servers and one hostess for a place with about 15 tables.  Service isn't fast but it is good.  This is a family owned place.  The servers know their wine, recommending a great red to compliment our meal.  The prices are fantastic.  Three entrees, two glasses of wine, under $50!

They have some traditional items, but then they have their only Madison twists like Sicilian Steak Stroganoff.  

I ordered the Chicken Parm and I was very impressed.  The noodles were perfect and the chicken has a nice crisp.  It stood up to being covered by sauce.  The Chicken Parm was easily two meals.  I loved that they served it on a metal plate because my food stayed hot the entire time.  

I would 100% recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We came in with high expectations, but they were not met. 

Some of us ordered their sampler plate. The marinara sauce was far from spectacular, and the cheese on top of it was about the same. The texture was closer to pizza than anything else. I also didn't like the breaded chicken. Why would you bread chicken and pour marinara sauce over it? On the bright side, the sausage that came with the sampler plate was quite good.

We ordered a bottle of wine and didn't get a small sample pour after the bottle was opened. I though that was commonplace these days. But other than that, the waitress did a good job. The service was the best part of our stay, and saves this place from getting one star.

They also had live music. A guitarist and a violinist if I recall. The guitarist was alright, the violinist not so much. It was a little hard not to laugh.

Overall, I'd say this place is a sub-par diner with better seating than the traditional seats you'd find at such establishments. I was told by the rest of my party to enjoy the wine a little faster after we finished eating, and we left the place shortly thereafter, laughing, and determined not to come back."}
{"text":"I'm from New York, and I'm pretty picky about both pizza and pasta. I love both here. The cheese pizza is my favorite in town. The penne vodka is better than my own homemade. The red sauce is fantastic: sweet and basil-y!

Update: went back for more penne ala vodka takeout. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was separated into reddish oil and clumps of cream, as though it had been reheated. No sweet creamy taste, no sweet tomatoes, just tasted like oil. I'd try it again, to see if they can match the first time, but not on a busy weekend night."}
{"text":"Perfect cozy atmosphere. This is the place to go if you want to feel comfortable while eating stellar food."}
{"text":"Good restaurant if you go to the physical one. If you get delivery, don't order on a Friday or Saturday night. You will wait 2 hours for a pizza! We have had this done to us a few times where it takes a couple phone calls (After the initial order placing call, and mainly being put on hold) to get a pizza delivered.  If we wouldn't have called a couple times, we probably wouldn't have gotten dinner. Bottom line: Good food, but crappy delivery service on busy nights."}
{"text":"I've been ordering take-out from this place for a few years. I remember the first time I ordered the alfredo and had shrimp and mushrooms added to it. I was very surprised to see 6 JUMBO shrimp in the alfredo and they didn't even charge me for the mushrooms. The sauce is thick and creamy and the noodles are always al dente. You get a free side of garlic bread and it's my favorite kind, which is a small loaf of bread. I continue to order this same shrimp alfredo and it's always been delicious and they have never charged me for the mushrooms. The delivery staff is always very friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I live in such close proximity to Bellitalia that it's just silly last night was my first visit. However, it won't be my last because YUM!!!  It's a cute little hole in the wall with lots of character. Upon walking in, the aromas alone made me really glad to be there.  Our server was lovely and attentive and had great suggestions whenever we asked. The prices are reasonable and the portions are quite generous.

I ordered the carbonara (it came with garlic bread) and my friend got a pizza. The carbonara was wonderful! Everything about it screamed homemade. And the bacon........the bacon was perfection and just the right amount too.  It wasn't at all a heavy dish like an Alfredo. I had some left over to take home, thank goodness (even thought I wanted to eat the entire bowl). The garlic bread was your basic garlic bread - nothing special, but it sufficed.

My only wish was that the pasta had been fresh, but honestly, the dish was super delicious regardless and it's something I would totally order again.  My friend really enjoyed her pizza as well. She loves their chocolate cake too, but they were all out, which in retrospect is probably a good sign with it being so popular.
Give Bellitalia a try. We're really glad we did!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try based on reviews and just wasn't that  impressed. Pizza and order of  Chicken Marsala. Both Looked good -  just didn't eat real  good .
I love garlic,  but it  was the overpowering  taste in both  
Crust had that  chewy soggy   like frozen pizza - maybe from being stuck to carry out box. Siciliana toppings were plenty but just  overpowered by garlic.
Chicken was really good quantity and juicy - just  didn't care for the sauce.
Service was friendly ordered by phone.
Maybe give another try dining in and order something red sauced ."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Italian food in Madison, this is your jam! After trying a bunch of subpar and overpriced Italian places downtown (I'm looking at you Tutto), my boyfriend and I stumbled across this place while out for a motorcycle ride one summer night, and haven't looked back since. It looks unassuming from the outside, but is cozy and warm on the inside. Crowd is a mix of families and older richies from nearby Maple Bluff, but we've always felt welcomed by their super-nice servers. 

The red sauce is sweet, but delicious on everything. I usually go with the baked mostacholi which comes with garlic bread, and I always have leftovers to take home. My boyfriend swears by the calzones, which are HUGE. Like, the size of a large pizza just folded in half. Overall, a great little gem on the north side."}
{"text":"Calamari was great! And so was the chicken pasta (forgot what the actual name was called because I was too busy stuffing my face). Although I never dined in, but I hope too one day since the food is great. The delivery was awesome, it was pretty speedy fast for a Sunday night. My food was nice and fresh! Unlike some deliveries were you wait so long that your food is cold! No not this place. Portion size is big, you pay for what you get. I couldn't finish my delivery order. Pricey but worth every single penny if you ask me. They charge for delivery which is $1.50. I will definitely save this place for the books next time I'm craving some great Italian food!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's become our go-to old-school Italian spot. It's a no-frills, building hasn't changed in 50 years sort of place, and I'm fine with that. It's not decorated in a romantic fashion, but something about it gives a romantic vibe, even when the clientele of the day is mostly families. 

The first thing I tried at Bellitalia was the chicken parmesan and I haven't strayed since. A metal tray of some of the best noodles I've ever had (so fresh! so chewy!) gets a dose of sweet red sauce, two thinly-pounded and breaded chicken breasts, and a healthy coating of cheese before being placed in the oven to get the cheese browned and bubbling. Is the metal tray the most elegant serving dish? No, but it keeps my food warm the entire duration of my meal. I've always got at least half to take home and it reheats surprisingly well. 

I've tried bites of my boyfriend's dishes and they have been great as well. The breaded ravioli is delicious, as is the complementary mini loaves of garlic bread. The only miss has been the Bellitalia Sticks - described as six breadsticks made from their homemade pizza dough I was imagining a basket of delicious, pillowy goodness. In reality, it was a rectangular sheet of pizza dough, cracker thin, cut into strips and sprinkled with herbs. It still fits the description on the menu, but for $6 dollars I was unimpressed. 

In general the price of appetizers is on the high side, but the entrees are reasonable. Prices are lower than Olive Garden and everything is house-made, fresh, and a heck of a lot tastier. 

Service is a bit below average, but I've also never had an adult server. It's always been young teens and since it's a small, family-owned place I cut them some slack. I'd be willing to bet it's the first job our servers have ever had and they have to learn somewhere. They've all been polite and friendly but sometimes we don't get checked on for long stretches or have to hunt them down for silverware, etc. My personal dining goals at Bellitalia are to enjoy a meal and conversation so I'm never really in a rush when I'm there but I understand how this would be frustrating to many. 

Give it a whirl - the old-school flavors might not be for you, but if it is up your alley you'll be sad you didn't discover this place sooner."}
{"text":"I worked at Cafe La Bellitalia in high school - over a decade later and it still is a no-frills, reasonably priced Italian place with a great red sauce (on the sweeter side), enormous portions, and heavy-handed servings of cheese. What more do you need, honestly? My favorite dishes are the chicken or eggplant parm and the baked mostaccioli. And importantly, the hostesses and wait staff are all friendly and helpful! Glad to have this gem on the Northside."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for dinner last night.  We split the Italian salad.  Then I had one of their specials, which was a seafood couscous.  My friend has the meatballs mostachocoli (probably spelled that wrong).  The food was very delicious.  My seafood couscous had a nice variety, with clams, muscles, shrimp, fish, and fried calamari.  I tried my friend's dish and the meatballs were delicious.  The tomato sauce is slightly sweet, but not overly sweet, and had a nice flavor.  
The only downside of the restaurant was the service/organization.  Our salad came out at the same time as the dinner and it took forever to get the garlic bread that came with our dinners.  Even though it was a Friday night, I felt like there was a little disorganization with the service/waitressing.  
I will definitely be going back to try the pizza, as I have heard good things about their pizza, but we will probably not go on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients. Authentic Italian recipes. To me the decor is very authentic as well. This place delivers too, and fast! I agree that the garlic bread on the hoagie bun isn't the best but the have countless awesome items and I haven't even tried them all. I also didn't like the fried zucchini, but only because I prefer a thin zucchini filet instead of the large chunks.

The Italian Beef is Amazing! Loved the fettuccine Alfredo. I think I like the Sicilian pizza is one of my favorites of all time. The mattarocca  on it is sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Each time we go, I order the Baked Mostaccioli w/ meat sauce. It is always excellent and my kids love it as well! I'd recommend dining in or ordering for delivery."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time a couple weeks ago.  Quality Italian food. Their red sauce and garlic bread were addictive. I ordered the stuffed shells and they were some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We lived in Madison 6 yrs ago and liked it then, and have been back since we've moved back and its just as good.  Everything we've had has been fantastic - lasagna, eggplant parm, alfredo, pizza, desserts (yup, all of 'em).  The online take out ordering is super easy, accurate time estimate, and well packaged to get to where you're going.  Overall, hasn't disappointed and consistently good through the years."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. If you like sweet sauce then this place is good for you. This last time was disappointing. It was a tad busy, but not busy considering waiter to table ratio but my dish sat out too long and the noodles were hard. The chicken was mostly breading and very flat. The bread is nothing to get excited about. 

 The north side has very very limited dining options so this place having a lot of business makes sense. There's a picture of Tommy Thompson on the wall and the restaurant is linked to Maple Bluff. The crowd seems very republican and I have only seen white people in the restaurant. When I brought someone who was not white, it was clear that he was not supposed to be there."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant in the Northside that does a decent job with your usual, Italian classics.  We ordered a side salad, a kid's spaghetti, lasagna, and a Works pizza.

The side salad was good, but didn't blow us away.  Our son, whom we took there to celebrate his 2nd birthday, devoured his spaghetti, so we were happy that we enjoyed his birthday dinner.  But the accompanying meatball was probably one of the worst meatballs we've had.  My husband thinks that maybe there was too much bread crumbs or whatever they used as filler since you didn't get much meat flavor at all.  The lasagna was tasty but also didn't blow me away--good balance of meat, cheese, and sauce, but the sauce was too sweet.

As for the pizza, we thought it was okay.  The dough is good, not greasy but flavorful.  As for the toppings, the meat and cheese was good, but we also weren't happy that our mushrooms and green peppers were not fresh.  It's not hard to get those vegetables fresh, even in Madison during the winter time.

As for service, the wait staff was very friendly.  There were two huge parties that filled up more than half of the restaurant but we didn't feel slighted at all.  Our waiter also made sure that we got our order in before those parties so that our food came out in a timely manner.  That was a very nice touch.

We've had better but we'll come by again if we really have a hankering for inexpensive, regular Italian classics.  We would have given this place 2 1/2 stars if it was possible."}
{"text":"Great little place on the northside!! Kid friendly and quaint, this little gem of a restaurant has a great menu for meat eaters and non alike! We will def be back. Good+ portion size, incredible flavor and good service will be added to our list of favorites!!!"}
{"text":"5 of us visited on New Year's Day and loved it!
Cozy, friendly, the food was very good and plenty of it.  The service was friendly and helpful.

Since then we have been back 2 more times and we were not disappointed!
The portions are huge."}
{"text":"Thank you Pietro, for actually serving really outstanding food in one of the worst, dismal cities in the United States. Awesome is an adjective that still doesn't do this place justice. The pasta was delicious, the gravy was sweet, like it should be. The chicken was tender, I have nothing bad to say about this place, except that it is in Madison, WI instead of north Jersey, where this place would be home.

After having to experience one of the worst restaurants in Madison, WI (Pedro's), it was a pleasure to visit and write about this one."}
{"text":"Waitress put a hot baked plate right in front of my 10 month olds vicinity or area where he could grab things, terrible experience. However, good bake spaghetti with meat sauce:) Not a good spot for people with young kids."}
{"text":"Italian comfort food.  Huge servings, tasty sauces, and a wonderful atmosphere.  The tables are close together, and dining seems an almost communal experience.  The waitresses really bustle and take good care of you.  My favorite is the baked cheese tortellini, and my husband always orders the chicken fettuccine Alfredo.  Nothing is fancy, just very filling and tasty.   The best part:  They deliver!  We order from them often, and where else can you get great Italian food delivered to your house?  They are a wonderful part of the north side of Madison."}
{"text":"The only place in town that makes eggplant parmigiana as good as or better than my own. Solid, traditional [American] Italian food, nice service."}
{"text":"Um. I don't know how to be constructive on this one. I wanted to like this place so bad because I've heard great things and the Yelp reviews are 4 stars. But upon entering the restaurant I knew the experience wasn't going to be great. 

First of all, the waitress was very brash. She was very loud and said things that just seemed out of place. Like when she dropped off a second plate of free garlic bread. She said, \"I'm starving right now so enjoy\"... what?! You could hear her talking anywhere she was in the restaurant. Most times I couldn't hear my boyfriend but could hear her while she was 30 feet away. 

For the food, well, it was underwhelming. The free garlic bread didn't taste like it had garlic  on it. (Also, why would they have garlic bread on the menu as an appetizer when they give it away for free?) I ordered a pizza which tasted more like a frozen pizza than freshly made. My boyfriend did say his lasagna was good. I had a hard time believing he could taste anything other than the 1 pound of melted cheese that was engulfing the entire thing. 

I won't be back. There are much nicer places around Madison to enjoy Italian fare. As well, more professional servers who make the dining experience fun rather than distracting."}
{"text":"My parents have been raving about this place for the last few weeks.  A friend of theirs had taken them there about two or three times.

My parents chose Cafe La Bellitalia for their anniversary dinner.  So now it is my time to explore.  The building is old but functional.  The decor is dated but cute.  The only people in the restaurant were over 60 years of age (with exception of my brother and I, and the wait staff).   As we were leaving, a younger crowd was coming in.  My impression is the place doesn't have to be fancy if it serves good food and has a following.

You don't get frills.  Cans for soda, plastic pepsi glasses for water.  But the food was good.  My parents didn't have as good as an experience as they have had in the past.  Different cook maybe? 

 I enjoyed my spagetti carbonara with a side salad to start.  I thought it was cooked well.   I tried my father's spagetti with meat balls.  It was good but a little too sweet for me.  My dad thought his plate was not as full as on the past visit.   My mother had pasta dish with shrimp.  Her complaint was there were too many green peppers in the dish.  My brother had a calzone with a dish for the same marinara used on the spagetti.
  My side salad was a pretty good size so I ended up taking half my pasta home with me.

To sum up, I would be happy to try this place again or try carry out."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  It's the best Italian food we've had outside of Italy.  Tonight I had the La Siciliana  which is tuna and spaghetti.  It is wonderfully flavored and done perfectly.   My wife had the swordfish special which was to die for.  An incredible flavor and two big pieces of fish.   We came  home with one of them for lunch tomorrow!!  We have been there a number of times, and have been impressed with everything they have.   No kidding the sauce takes us back to Italy!!  If you like real Italian you will love this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding neighborhood haunt. I've had several first dates here, and I have never, ever had a bad experience. It's sort of in a funky spot up on Sherman, but definitely worth the minor schlep to get there. 

It's totally one of those places you don't want to tell people about because it's your special secret. But, people of the internet, you should go. :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Delicious South Italian food. Low to moderate prices. Large portions. Service (Alex) was great."}
{"text":"Very cool local Italian place. Smallish, casual,reasonable.

They pride toasted garlic bread before the meal.

Fried Calamari - good. A little heavier breading and grease than we prefer.

Gnocchi -  very good! Large portion, good texture, tasty sauce

Chick Parm - very good! Large portion, very cheesy.

Red sauce is very tomato and a bit on the sweet side."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza, a side salad, and a spaghetti and meatballs. The pizza was pepperoni pan pizza...very basic order. We were disappointed because it's a neighborhood restaurant and gets great reviews. None of the three dishes was really good. They were all okay, but not even good enough that we'd turn to it regularly when we're feeling too lazy to cook (our lazy food standards aren't real high). The pizza was a little salty, as was the spaghetti. The salad was what you'd expect from a midwestern family restaurant--a little wilted, too much cheese... all in all a pretty humdrum meal. Edible but not memorable."}
{"text":"Great classic Italian. Plus best pizza in Madison. And yes, I've been to Sal's Tomato Pies, so shut up."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today because we were out running errands and we had a coupon (otherwise it's a bit of a hike from the West side)

It is a cute little place, and it was very empty at 1 PM (only one other table seated, two more came as we were finishing). I ordered lasagna and a side salad and he ordered  the meat lovers pizza with no sausage and extra cheese. 

He said the pizza was tasty, but it appeared that they forgot to add the extra cheese (although they didn't forget to charge us  $2.50 for it-it would have been nice if they subbed it for the sausage). 

It seems like the extra cheese made its way to my lasagna. I felt like I was eating a pile of melted cheese and sauce. The sauce was a little too sweet for my liking. I did not see/taste any meat in the lasagna, and hardly even saw the noodles! It was supposed to be served with garlic bread but I did not get any.  

My water glass remained empty throughout my meal, and although it was pretty empty the waitress did not stop to check in on us at all during the meal."}
{"text":"Not fancy but very cozy family feeling. Went out on a limb and got the Pesto and shrimp pizza ... Pretty delish. The customers was done perfectly and it was a thinner crust which I like. I would come back again :) it worth stopping in if your in the area"}
{"text":"The food, the service and atmosphere were perfect in every way. I would definitely recommend the veal to anyone. This place is truly the gem of the north side. It was like being in Italy again. Grazie Bellitalia! :-)"}
{"text":"The S.U. and I were on our way home from the airport....... hungry, time-zone challenged, with nothing in the fridge to look forward to when we got home so ... we needed dinner. CLB had been on my radar for a while but, as West-siders, we didn't get up here all that often.

It was a Saturday night but we managed to sneak into a table for two, ordered a glass of very reasonable wine (Chianti) and were quickly handed their hot garlic bread. Nice touch.The place was busy.

This is an old school Italian American restaurant. Red sauce, white sauce, large portions, fresh pasta. You could drop someone from 1969 in here and (aside from the prices) they wouldn't know that they were in the future. No small plates, no exotic ingredients (garlic used to be an exotic ingredient), just good basic Italian, well done.

I had the Italian beef stuffed cannelloni with red sauce. As others mentioned, a slightly sweet sauce but ... no complaints. The S.U. had the Veal Parmigiana. It was served under a blanket of spaghetti with red sauce. She thought the veal was a bit dry.

This ain't haute cuisine my friends, but it's solid Italian American food made with care. That makes me a fan."}
