{"text":"4 stars for the family meal, if you get it on a good night (3 large entree, 1 lrg fried rice, 1 lrg white rice, 4 egg roll, 4 crab puff $24.00) .

We've eaten here maybe 10 times, the last visit was last month. 
That order was the best one yet, I actually think I got the owner's order or CE saw their Yelp reviews and fixed the problems.

Anyway... I think I got the owner's order because the broccoli beef was mostly beef and only 3 broccoli, usually it's the other way around. I'm a huge broccoli fan so I never complained, but was in total shock when I opened the paper box.
The fried rice had egg in it..... what???? I've been here how many times and this is the first time egg ever slipped into the fried rice haha. 

Lastly, they are coupon nazi's, they don't care if you are GOD himself, if you don't have the coupon you ain't getting the deal."}
{"text":"As a full-time worker, a bachelor, and a vegan Chopstick Express is a a great quick fix for me on busy weeknights. The prices are fair and while their tofu dishes may not be the healthiest thing in the world, they sure are tasty!

The orange tofu is a favorite, but I'll go for the general tso is probably my favorite. They'll even make sweet and sour tofu (not on the menu) if you just ask them.

Also, the egg(less) rolls are allegedly vegan, so dig in! 

Final vegan note, the woman on the phone told me that she thought there was egg in the chow mein noodles, but if you're vegan you know how flaky people can be about whats in what so I'll definitely have to ask again some time.

Edit: Worst. Fortune. Cookies. EVER! My cookie told me the equivalent to \"water is wet\". 

Edit 2: Baby corn is gross! Don't get in near me!

Edit 3: And I wanna wrap my own moo-shu :-("}
{"text":"I've had 3 experiences with Chopstick Express.  

First Experience: Absolutely terrible.  My roommate and I were already starving, but decided some orange chicken was worth the wait.  Our food was an hour late.  I called and asked, and the person on the phone seemed to have no knowledge of our order.  Truth be said, it wasn't worth the wait.

The other two experiences were pretty blah.  It's 'Ok' quality chinese food, but not something to rave about, EXCEPT their crab puffs!  Those are just delicious!

Take the good with the bad I suppose."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery and they are generous with the portions. Have ordered delivery from them probably over a dozen times over the last 3 years. Sometimes the food is far more flavorful than others, although I imagine that depends on whoever the cook is. Our previous order was pretty bland tasting (rare) - but today we requested extra spicy for everything, and boy-oh-boy, did we get it!  lol"}
{"text":"It is very hard for me to rate place, compared to similar carry out Asian food in Arizona. This place would be the best just because of the orange tofu. But one item cannot really do the trick. Server is usually slow, or non existent for some periods of time. I recall coming here several times a week, due to convenience to my work place. I would standing there 15 mins waiting, for the rude ASU football line back to ask me \" what do you want\" in the rudest tone. Not the tone you would expect after waiting a long time for service, but I was always hungry, and just wanted to get in and out. I always would order on the phone, the same thing. But sometimes I would get different containers. A large would be a med, and med would be a small. Some days I had left overs, others I was still pretty hungry. Besides the orange tofu, there is not much on the menu that is good. I have tried others, but have yet to like anything else. And to be honest, 8 bucks for fried tofu with a cheap orange sauce is not a great value. Compared to other US cities, this place ranks very low in my book. Overpriced tofu, and crummy customer service. I just hate places that make me want to leave the second I walk in."}
{"text":"This was god awful. 

The chicken was fat with some skin and flavorless sauce. Somehow, they messed up the rice too. 

\"How is pork-fried rice ever dry?\" said the boyfriend.

 It's making me want to vomit just thinking about how to describe the food. 

The crab puffs were decent. But, really, don't. Get Thai.

No idea how this has such good reviews."}
{"text":"Currently scarfing this for lunch, and I couldn't be happier. They offer an extensive tofu selection, and it's not just bland tofu with veggies.

I almost always get it delivered - yes, the Gods have smiled upon us.

I'm eating the orange tofu with white rice. And it's pretty good. I got the combo, mainly because they don't offer the tofu with the lunch specials, but for those who eat meat, you can get a huge portion of food for $5. Yes, this is a true statement.

As far as the actual location, it's reminicent of any other New York chinese food place, and that's why Chopsticks holds a special place in my heart. You can really never go wrong.

Service is nice, and the delivery people are always so nice.  Amen, Chopsticks.

P.s. They're located right next door to an excellent dive bar. Stop by Chopsticks for dinner, and then drinks to the bar. Make a night of it. Invite me, though.
P.p.s.  The fortune cookies are pretty tasty. This time my fortune was, \"A sense of humor is one of your greatest assets.\" I  dig it."}
{"text":"Only order from here if you are having bowel movement troubles.  Ordered from here twice, violently ill both times."}
{"text":"I started going here about two years ago and they have never let me down. Granted it's not gourmet Chinese food it is a great meal for a low price. The workers are all very friendly and give you that nice home like feeling from the minute you walk in. There is tons of variety too! The tofu is greAt and so is the lemon chicken. There is also so much more, if you are looking for a good quick meal for low price then this is where to go!"}
{"text":"Crab Puffs are to die for I'm trying to Chow Mein House special in a few. We'll  see if I like that.  the only thing that bothered me is when I went to go heat up their teriyaki chicken from the day before  the sauce  is like burning hot  but still looks like clumps of blubber and it's disgusting. I don't think I'll order your teriyaki chicken again."}
{"text":"If you enjoy over fried, flat wonton w/ a rubber ball I think was pork....then you would like chopsticks.... 
If you enjoy eggrolls that have a soft, undiscribable filling, then you would like chopsticks....
The sweet and sour sauce had a consistency of water and was cold, below room temp....it must have been refrigerated and I have never been served ice cold s/s before. 
The pork chow mein, it's lo mein but they call it soft noodle chow mein was edible. 
I asked if they could make me fried rice w/ o egg and they would not so I am going to assume that they do not serve cook to order but bulk pre cooked, not fresh. 
I'm allergic to egg and have Never been turned down for fried rice/No egg. 
Fortune cookies were good.
Lets say dog ate great last nite, I was very disappointed, I'll stick to panda!!!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible!  The shrimp fried rice is subpar but the egg fu young was disgusting!  Like I couldn't understand why they sale that masked as egg fu young but it wasn't good what so ever.  Do not order from here for you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just very disappointed with my delivery order...ordered the teriyaki chicken and crispy wontons...but never again unfortunately."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered last night around 7:15, probably the peak of dinner time. Our food arrived quickly and smelled delicious. So you can imagine our disappointment. I got the Cashew Chicken combo, which came with fried rice, an eggroll, and a crab puff, and the serving was HUGE. I dished up a portion of it, combing through the cashew chicken for the chicken. The chunks were sparse, to say the least. But, okay, I like water chestnuts and peas as much as the next girl. Moving on to the fried rice: I have never tasted anything so bland. It was like putting textured air into my mouth. I looked at my boyfriend, who was eating Sweet and Sour Pork and white rice. \"Eating\" probably isn't the right word; it was more like poking and prodding with a sad look on his face. We agreed it was a sad meal. I turned my attention back to my own plate. Maybe the crab puff would be good? Nope. I bit through the hard, not flaky pastry and into a cream sauce that just kind of sat there, not tasting like anything. The last attempt to find something edible was the egg roll. It was passable, but after all that, my taste buds were no longer in the mood. I tossed what was left on my plate (which was most of it) and put the rest that was still in the box into the fridge, in the hopes that the leftovers will be a little better. That can happen, right? 

The worst part is that I would rather give my money to independent businesses instead of chains, but Chopstick Express is not worth it. I would rather get my Chinese fix from Panda Express, because it's not depressing. My boyfriend saved the takeout menu that was left on the front door \"just in case\" he said. I cannot imagine what kind of case would arise where we would put ourselves through that ever again. If I am going to indulge in Chinese, the calories had better be worth it. You're not going to get that Chopstick Express."}
{"text":"The service here is great. I ordered takeout and showed up a half hour early, fully expecting to wait 30 minutes before I got my food. Instead, they had it out for me in less than 10 minutes. The woman behind the counter was very accommodating, polite, and nice. The food itself was decent. It's pretty much your standard Chinese-American takeout place so you know what you're gonna get, though the crab puffs I thought were particularly delicious. The portions are fairly sized and not too expensive. 

Overall, good food and great service. I'll definitely come back before long."}
{"text":"My usual place doesn't deliver so I decided to try their food. After waiting one hour, I received mixed vegetables in a scorched, burnt tasting sauce. The soup was old. It tasted off and the ingredients were mushy. Even the green onion. The white rice was fine and their honey wings are good, but I won't be ordering here again. Next time I'll make the drive to my normal place."}
{"text":"the best cat food in tempe!   i wish they would respect our privacy and right to 

not have them solicit our complex with taping ther adverts throughout our complex against our rules...."}
{"text":"I drive from North Scottsdale (45 minute drive, one way, with no traffic) just to come here. The Honey Tofu is amazzzzzzzing! The staff is always super friendly & ive never tried anything here that I didn't like. But, seriously, try the honey tofu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid!! We ordered here because of a flier on our door and they deliver. The main dishes were ok, it's hard to mess up sweet and sour and teriyaki. The fried rice was the worst I've ever had, I can't believe they even choose to send this out. The crab puffs were hard and soggy at the same time and the filling was just Philadelphia cream cheese alone. The eggs rolls had a tolerable texture but were almost bitter in taste. After waiting for over an hour for delivery this meal was terribly disappointing! We will never order here again!!"}
{"text":"Where else can you find perfectly crisp tofu doused the Chinese sauce of your choice? This place rocks for veggie lovers! Food is delivered fast and hot on arrival.

After 4 years being stuck outside their delivery zone I am exited to be back in, and so is my husband because he doesn't have to go pick it up anymore."}
{"text":"This is my second order, and by accident. I ordered from them months ago and swore never again. 

But it just so happened that I get so many flyers on my door that this one slipped through. 

First things first. I ordered pork and veg. And chicken and veg for myself as I only eat chicken fish and turkey. Reason I say that is because I received chicken and veg, with shrimp and veg. Guess who's deathly allergic to shrimp.

The food was bland, dry and Luke warm. The fried rice is the worst I ever tasted. Salty, and dry. And not even that nice Brown nutty color of fried rice, I almost thought it was spoiled food. 

The lady on the phone said she heard me say I wanted shrimp, that's a lie I'm not suicidal and don't have an eppi pen. Why would I order shrimp lady.

Also she was giggling when I asked her if she got a lot of complaints. I didn't check yelp before I placed my order, if I had this would all have been avoided.

She offered to refund my money forty min ago. If she does I will post it later, if she doesn't I will go postal. I only wish I paid with a credit card so I could dispute this, and not worry about a refund. It

If you're thinking about placing  an order, don't waste your money. It would be better spent on burritos out of the freezer at the local Circle K.
Never again Chopsticks ???? Express?

Ok they delivered my refund. But not before I received my two subs from Jimmy Johns. Express...lol what a joke"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Chopstick's about a year ago! The food is awesome, and the staff is wonderful too! They are very friendly, clean and well priced. Plus they don't use MSG and they have an entire vegetarian menu, including tofu options, awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Tempe. I usually order for delivery, but I have dined in a couple times.  The place is family run so the employees actually care. 

Delivery is consistent 30-40 min.  Drivers are nice. 

Food is great.  I am picky with my Chinese food and this place meets my standards.  The vegetables are always hot yet crisp so I know they use fresh vegetables. Unlike other places where the vegetables are soggy. 

Spice can be altered on every dish on a scale from 1 to 10. I usually order the level 4 spice, which is really spicy for me, but oh so good. 

Basically, best Chinese place in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Super awesome experience! I called at 8:50 to see what time they closed because I wanted to place an order for delivery. The gentleman who answered the phone was clear, friendly & professional. I had no idea what I really wanted to order and when I told him it was me and 3 teenagers he had the perfect solution. The family meal was perfect on my budget and I still have some for breakfast. The delivery guy was awesome too!  Right on schedule like they said and the food was hot... Not just warm. I'll definitely order from here again"}
{"text":"Chunks of mystery meat in the hot and sour soup.  Fried rice is just oily, has no flavor.  Crab wantons folded in odd ways. Orange Chicken had tough chicken in overly long strips. Will not order again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for almost 20 years now.  Food is consistent and prices are good.  Done both pickup and delivery.  Always surprised at how fast the delivery times are. I love their beef and broccoli and their Mongolian beef. My kids like their orange chicken. Never been unhappy once."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be amazing because it's in my neighborhood & I enjoy supporting local biz whenever possible, but it was just ok.  The honey tofu, which I was super excited about after reading other reviews, was somewhat soggy even though I ordered \"extra crispy.\" The fried rice was a decent texture but didn't have any veggies in it.  Probably won't be back, bummer."}
{"text":"I feel as though they should change their name. They're not very express and give you no chopsticks! The food isn't bad, but you can definitely get better in Tempe. I probably won't order from them again. Seriously, what's up with that astronomical delivery charge and no receipt?"}
{"text":"The Sweet and Sour Chicken is hit and miss. One week the chicken will be good the next week dry and tough like it had been sitting out for hours or leftovers from the day before. There have been a few times when I ended up getting a stomach ache from eating here. When its good it's tasty but when it's bad it's terrible."}
{"text":"Yucky food! Greasy breaded chicken that was not delicious. Fried rice was bland and icky! Only good thing were the spring rolls."}
{"text":"First of all, when you walk in the place is a underwhelming. It's not dirty, just they haven't done much with the building yet it seems. And it's very small. I don't ever order soda from the soda fountain however, because that thing looks 20 years old. The service is not bad. Our biggest problem with CE so far has been that they charge $2 extra if you want chow mien instead of their flavorless fried rice. But it seems like that's how it is all over AZ which is very messed up. Anyway, the reason I keep coming back to this place is purely for their Mu Shu Vegetables. It's mouthwatering delicious. When you get your combo, it comes with the aforementioned flavorless fried rice (And that's all it is, rice. No veggies or meat in it), crab puffs which are pretty good, a spring roll which is not good at all, and two HUGE things that look like burritos filled with the mush shu veggies. The side if plum sauce could be a lot bigger. I used the whole dinky container on one mu shu. But I was afraid to ask for more because I figured they would charge me extra for that too. If that mu shu wasn't so good I probably would not come here anymore."}
{"text":"First time trying chopstick express.  It's always hard finding a good Chinese food place that uses quality meats (lean, not fatty or gristly) and fresh tasting. But Chopstick Express definitely delivered. We ordered the Orange chicken, Mongolian beef and chicken chow mein.  All was excellent and the staff was very helpful and friendly as well.  Helpful hint: there are only a few small tables for inside dining. It's best to order take-out or have it delivered.  I definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Great place! Our favorite item by far is the crispy Thai tofu (and I'm not a vegetarian). The sauce is awesome and the tofu is firm and crispy. They're like mini French toasts."}
{"text":"Wasn't great but wasn't disgusting either. Probably won't be returning as there are better options in the area"}
{"text":"Negative 3 stars!  Ordered sweet and sour pork, tasted like crap, rice and egg were no good.  Everything tastes old.  Hope I don't get sick!"}
{"text":"I was feeling lazy after working, and after looking through my fridge I decided to order Chinese food. I have had a menu for this place on my fridge for awhile, so I decided to call them up. They delivered my food in about and hour. The egg roll tasted like balls, and the cheese wontons were missing the cheese. I hit the Thai Chicken, and it was ok, but all in all I will never order from this place again, and I would urge you, yes you, to choose a different place tonight. #NotWorthIt....."}
{"text":"We've had this place a few times and it's just keeps getting worse each time we order it.  Apparently the small/large meals don't come with egg rolls, unless you specifically say \"combo\".  And the website doesn't have the combo option, so you get your meat and white rice for $9.  Also, we ordered shrimp fried rice for $7 and it came with 4 shrimp.  
This place is not good enough to be so dang expensive."}
{"text":"We just tried this out today and the food is amazing! The Chow Mein had tons of assorted fresh veggies and the crab puffs are great. I enjoyed everything I tasted!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was nearby for the longest time, but I'm so glad I found it. The food is filling without being overly-breaded, and I don't feel like a lump of coal afterwards. Staff is very nice, too."}
{"text":"I have to imagine that the people leaving positive reviews have simply never had decent Chinese food. Disgusting."}
{"text":"So, we came home 2 days ago to find one of those irritating menus left on the doorknob, so we took it inside and left it on the floor.

Yesterday, I was craving some Chinese food when, lo and behold!, what should I stumble upon? The previously discarded Chopstick Express menu. Now, I don't have terribly high expectations of Chinese food outside of New York, but we were pleasantly surprised by both the price and flavor of our meal.

Jamie was coming home for lunch, so I ordered delivery--the shrimp in lobster sauce Lunch combo for me, the mongolian beef Lunch combo for him, then an order of potstickers and a quart of honey-dipped chicken.

Wow. I've been searching EVERYWHERE for boneless honey chicken, and this did not disappoint--it was slathered in this sweet sauce, yet still crispy! 

the Lunch combos come with fried rice, a cream cheese wonton, and a spring roll--all steaming hot and very flavorful. my shrimp in lobster sauce was delicious, but nothing special; it tasted pretty much just like it had at the last place, and the place before that. 

the mongolian beef, on the other hand, was phenomenal! tangy, crispy, maybe a little too salty, but still incredible...it almost tasted  like it had been cooked in teriyaki sauce.

another plus--we were worried that Jamie would have to bring a frozen pizza back to work with him for lunch, since they said the food would arrive at about 12:45(when he leaves for work again)...but they showed up at 12:25! so..yay :)"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout, so I won't be commenting on the actual restaurant as I've never been. Our order arrived surprisingly fast as this really isn't a city set up for speedy delivery. The food was great for the price. I wasn't expecting haute cuisine like other Asian food snobs. I can tell by how a menu looks and what the prices are whether I'll be getting delicious greasy 90's style Chinese takeout or not. 

I tried the orange chicken, hunan beef, and cashew chicken. I also had some appetizers. Everything was good. The portions were huge and we had another meal the next night with leftovers. Order the family combo. It's worth a try and it's only $22. 
I'll definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"As far as cheap chinese food goes, this place does it right!  Ken and Karen are always friendly and serve up satisfying food in a flash.  I really like the teryaki or house chicken, although the mongolian beef is a close third.  Favorite menu item: the curry beef roll.  Best thing about Chopstick: the prices.  5$ lunch combos make this my number one lunch destination!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten inside the restaurant, so I can't speak of that experience.  However, I've been ordering delivery from this place (almost) exclusively for a few years.  I'm from NY so I guess I have a certain expectation for \"Chinese\" food.  This place is excellent.  I've ordered just about every chicken, beef and vegetarian item on the menu and 9 out of 10 times I get a damn-near perfect meal.  Their pricing is comparable, the staff is friendly (on the phone, at least) and the delivery time is respectable considering they make everything from scratch to order.  I've tried several other Chinese joints since coming out to Arizona and Chopstick Express is the only one I consistantly order from.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Along the lines of greasy Americanized Chinese take-out, Chopstick Express is pretty good. We used to order from here once in a while on lazy days when I'd stay at the boyfriend's house. We'd get our fill of breaded, fried, and sauced meat dishes like the lemon peel or orange chicken, but my particular favorites were the oily and comforting lo mein noodles with char sui pork. Cheap, quick, convenient...their tofu dishes are also pretty decent, but this is by no means \"real, authentic\" fare...think: better than Panda Express and cheaper too..."}
{"text":"I am so dissapointed by what i got today
I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce which came with only 5 shrimps inside
And i ordered chicken which taste only like viniger
I also had coupons of 2 free can sodas and they didnt even bring it in
I am so disspointed of my meals and service
And delivery takes too long
Food doesnt even taste like chinese
Taste like nothing but viniger and salt"}
{"text":"I lived up the street from this place for almost a year and could NEVER get enough of that crispy honey tofu! MMMMMM! Too bad I live in LA now, I can't find a sauce as great as that!"}
{"text":"Well let me start off by saying Great Job. 
Ordering very easy, keep me informed of status. And came on time. 
For the food , hot to the touch, smelled great and the flavor. Bar baque slices great. House Chow Mein Great. Will recommend over and over
    Greg"}
{"text":"Agree with most,,,, bad....won't be back....bland , tasteless,,, I wish I could give no star"}
{"text":"This place left a flyer on my apartment door, and my bro and I decided, what the heck, they deliver! And the prices didn't seem bad at all. 

I was actually pleasantly surprised. I had the fried rice and shrimp and it tasted awesome. The delivery guy was a little awkward but nice and it took about 30 minutes. I will definitely get more food from these guys again."}
{"text":"Can't remember the last time I came home without a Chopstick Express pamphlet on my door. I used to buy from Chopstick Express, and their food was pretty good, but since they started their door knob marketing campaign I will never order from them ever again."}
{"text":"so good! awesome vegan/vegetarian options and they are super friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered from Chopstick Express and had it delivered to us.  Both the chicken with broccoli and the house egg foo young combos came with heaping portions.

The rice was dry.  The chicken with broccoli was bland and way too creamy.

I don't think you should have stomach pains after eating a meal, and since my hubby and I both had stomach pains after eating their food, we won't be eating their food again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Chopstick Express like 5 or 6 times in the last two weeks--they are amazing! :D

The delivery people are always friendly with warm smiles and equally warm food! 

Chopstick Express always offers fresh food, tantalizing flavors, and friendly service all at a great price.

Personally for me I love their Shrimp Chow Mein, Egg Foo Young, and Orange Tofu. The Shrimp Chow mein is always fresh and hot and the vegetables are always crisp like they just cut them before sending them over. The Tofu is always firm with a delightful carrot-y orange-y-gingery flavor. It is wonderful ^_^

 I highly recommend you go try them if you are in Tempe--go, go now!"}
{"text":"I'm full and disappointed. I ordered shrimp egg foo young and crispy orange tofu. The egg foo young was burnt and even the sauce didn't saturate all of the burnt crispy edges. It was burnt, not over cooked but burnt enough to have that distinct burnt flavor. Fried shrimp were served on top, the condensation from the styrofoam container render the batter into a soft mush. I expected the shrimp to be mixed into the egg foo young cakes. The orange tofu on first bite was promising, but the the sweet sauce was just that sweet. It was not hot or spicy as the menu indicated. Considering the reviews I read prior to ordering I was really looking forward to this meal. Perhaps my experience is a fluke, still I'm not willing to spend my hard earned pennies on a second chance.  There's wasn't anything promising about the meal."}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars Bc the good is really good, I'm sure there is better out there but the flavors are fun and unique. They are fast and convenient, friendly and accommodating. They give u huge portions, it's always warm and hearty. The pricing is extremely reasonable and don't skimp on sauces or sides. They always pay attention to my instructions when I order on grub hub too! Love this place when I want to have a filling late night dinner. Delivery times never exceed 30-40 minutes."}
{"text":"Placed an order online, and it took over an hour to arrive. We called the restaurant to check on our order, and they just hung up on us the first time. The driver couldn't find our apartment, so we had to go down to the office and wait on him. When we opened up the food, it was cold, and didn't contain the correct order. It was also missing the vegetable chow mein we'd ordered. We called back, and explained that we'd gotten the wrong order, and were missing items, and they tried saying that the orange chicken we'd received was, in fact, the kung pao pork that we had ordered. Not true. They're two completely different dishes. They did offer to bring the chow mein, which arrived about 40 minutes after we'd finished eating what was probably someone else's order."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place one more chance after hearing how good their honey tofu was.  It was bland and horrible texture. Their fried rice equally bland.  Chow mein however did pack a punch of garlic flavor."}
{"text":"Definitely not going to order from here again.  The egg rolls were under-cooked and the chicken in the Kung Pao was over-cooked.  The fried Won Tons are stale.  My guess is that we got the leftovers from before the dinner crowd. 
 
On the plus side, the delivery was really fast and the driver was very friendly and he brought us sweet and sour, hot mustard and soy sauce, plus he helped my boyfriend pry the back off his phone.  

I didn't taste the Hunan Beef, but I think it was passable because my boyfriend ate all of his food. 

I really hate giving them a bad review because of how good the service was, but I need both."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's fast, and it's pretty damn good for a meal under 10 dollars, actually, my order is usually around $5.00.

They have all the favorites you'd expect in a chinese restaurant, and can make pretty much anything vegan. The tofu here is some of my favorite tofu i've had, it's a perfect blend of crunchy and soft. 

It's not necessarily an aesthetic place, but they deliver and have take out, problem solved."}
{"text":"There are some harsh reviews out there. I did not think this place was that bad at all.
I went in to order,I was getting it to go.
 It is not a bad place inside, very simple and also clean. The girl who took my order was very pleasant.
I ordered the kung Poa chicken to go with steamed rice. It came with an egg roll and a crab puff. A pretty good deal I think.
The food was good, nice and hot as well. It was supposed to be spicy. But, was not really too much. 
Next time I will just tell them I would like it a bit spicer. Lots of parking in the lot."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken and vegetable
Got home with shrimp and vegetables 
Not happy,didn't eat it, and was to far to return."}
{"text":"Have ate here a few times the only thing worth ordering is the pot stickers ! Food is made haphazardly with low quality ingredients and it's poorly prepared!! After tonight's order I will never order from them again the items were just thrown in the bag several items spilled and the pepper beef was awful ! Never going back"}
{"text":"Eggfoo young was \" deconstructed\" it was a deep fried patty of batter with shrimp and overcooked beef and chicken. General tsaos was soggy and tasted like bagged chicken tenders from the grocery store, I'm almost positive they were. Even the fortune cookie was stale..."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on here before calling & I wasn't disappointed. The crispy honey tofu was yummy!  Lots of vegetarian options too, which is always a plus.  Hunnie & I were both very pleased with the combo meals. The delivery man was really nice too. We'll definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I am not even sure what I ate, or if I really want to remember.  

All I know it is below average just like the rest of the many greasy subpar Chinese places around here.

The worst is this: THEY USE STYROFOAM FOR EVERYTHING. Makes me sick to my stomach. I am tempted to give them 1 star for this reason.

Heck, they might as well go out and club baby seals while they are at it with all that styrofoam."}
{"text":"Delivery was 20 minutes sooner than expected. Food was medicore. Nothing to write home about. Better than Big Wa"}
{"text":"This is an affordable place, the second most important thing I look for when I eat. Most of the items are below $10. You can't find that in any Korean or Japanese restaurants. They have good online ordering system too."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Got their flyer on my door and decided to try them. I ordered the veggie Egg Fu Young combo. My friend ordered the General Tso's Chicken combo. The servings were huge. Unfortunately, both meals were bland. The Egg Fu Young was formed into two patties and smothered in a veggie sauce. That was fine. But once I started cutting into a party, it didn't seem to be made of egg - just some kind of filler. The rice that came with it was also bland - no egg or onion in it. It looked like the Chinese version of Mexican rice. The egg roll was off as well. The only thing that tastes like it was supposed to were the crab puffs. The General Tso Chicken was soggy and sweet. Isn't it supposed to be a little spicey? It was swimming in sauce. Again, the portion size was huge. But after satisfying our hunger, we threw the rest in the trash. I will be checking Yelp before ordering Chinese food again."}
{"text":"I like!  They have a good selection for us vegitarians, however the consistancy in the sauces is not head on.  They deliver on time and are very courteous."}
{"text":"Ordered at least 45 dollars worth of food and it did NOT taste anything like Chinese. The order took at least and hour and some minutes to get to my place. The chicken Kung Pao didn't taste anything like it, the veggies were cut way big and it came all soupy like, which I didn't care for. Orange chicken was waaaaay too dry and just wasn't appealing, the egg rolls seemed like they were half-cooked, it was still doughy and the white rice? C'mon now! Even that was dry and just not appealing at all, the only thing that tasted OK was the chicken fried rice and plain chow mein, that'll be the last time I ordered from there. I know some people might think its bomaby food but it's not.....PANDA EXPRESS tastes more like Chinese. Ugh! Guess I'm gonna keep on keeping on finding the \"RIGHT\" place for Chinese foods :)"}
{"text":"Used to pick up food for lunch all the time up to a year ago and it was great....ordered delivery just a few days ago ( Sunday afternoon 12/20) and it was awful... BBQ pork slices in a container half full of soggy, greasy cabbage... And since when does a business refuse to leave a receipt? Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"This place wasn't very good.  We ordered about 50 bucks worth of food.  I always look forward to having chinese leftover but not this time.  We ate some because we were hungry but ended up throwing away more than half of it. Hot and sour soup tasted off. All meat (beef in fried rice, chicken in lo mein, pork in sweet and sour pork) were extremely dry and not seasoned. Crab rangoon was ok. Eggroll didn't taste good.  Took one bite and tossed the rest.  House fried rice tasted underseasoned. 

Bottom line,  we tossed the to-go menu along with the leftover and will not be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food. I'm not sure if they consider themselves \"fast food\" but it's certainly not sit down. Honey tofu. Extra crispy. Large."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for classic Chinese take out.

Tons of vegetarian/vegan options, all made fast and fresh. The tofu has the perfect texture and the sauces are great. I suggest the honey tofu or the vegetable chow mein.

Defintiely get it to go, the place is pretty small and I'd imagine eating inside would just be plain awkward."}
{"text":"Rather quick delivery and a cubic buttload of food for their $20 family meal.. Their Chicken Chow mein doesn't have those small itty bitty cubes of chicken most places use, they're huge chunks about the size of McNuggets.. And their Orange Chicken is friggin delishilous.. =9"}
{"text":"Yum! I love the orange chicken. They always get my order right. Try the honey dipped chicken!"}
{"text":"This place sucked. Ordered the family meal for delivery. Got the orange chicken, Hunan beef, and chicken chow mien. The orange chicken was the worst I've ever had. Not crispy or breaded. Just soggy. Really, all of it sucked except the rice. But I ate it. Egg rolls were okay and the crab puffs were great but tiny. I won't order again. I only did because there was a flyer on our door. Great price for the meal tho."}
{"text":"No Lie.... this was by far the Worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. I ordered General Tsaos Chicken and Teriyaki chicken for my husband. His Teriyaki chicken was Grey and super dry.The General T was in a strange red sauce without the slightest hint of spicy.  We shared the General Tsao out of shear hunger, but couldn't eat the Teriyaki.  I NEVER write negative reviews but I had no choice with this one! The sad part was I didn't even check reviews because how do you mess up Chinese food?"}
{"text":"Friendly service great crispy tofu awesome lunch specials they have the best orange chicken and chow mein ! Great prices if you're feeling Chinese food look no where else ! They also deliver just in case it's too hot out and you don't want to leave your place they got you !"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Decently priced, fast service, and they deliver.  Their honey dipped chicken is ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Best Orange Chicken in town! The owner is such an amazing person and the entire staff is very friendly! Haven't had anything from this place that I didn't like!"}
{"text":"They delivery fast and their food is quite good.
The portion are a lot ! If you get the combo, you wont even finish it."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just feel like some old school Chinese food in little to go boxes. When I do I hit up chopstick express. The food is good is unassuming, services is quick and friendly, and the prices are fair. 

I have eaten here several times over the years when I'm not doing the pei wei or panda thing and it's always met expectations. Just the other day I placed an order for a cup of hot and sour, Kung pao and some wantons. It was ready to go and after a coupon(they were nice enough to take a 3 day expired one) it totaled about 12-15 with tip  the exact number escapes me.

The Kung pao lacked some of the heat i was looking for but with some spicy mustard that was mostly resolved. The wontons were really good and i had to try not to eat them all at once. I was also surprised how much hot and sour soup you got in a small order (enough for two decent portions).

Once again if you want decent Chinese with friendlyy service and a good price this is the way to go,"}
{"text":"Went here for the second time today. The food probably only rates a three, but the service definitely bumps it up a notch! They are so nice!! 

Today got the orange chicken lunch special ($5.25). Orange chicken, fried rice, cream cheese puff and egg roll. The orange chicken was a bit spicy for my taste, but good. I don't think I'll get the fried rice again, not much a fan of that. Also got an order of pot stickers ($4.95) that were tasty! Love love love the cream cheese puffs! 

Next time I'll ask for more sweet & sour. Not nearly enough for the stuff I got."}
{"text":"Num num num! 
That's what you'll be saying after you indulge in yummy takeout goodness from Chopstick Express. I'm a vegetarian and even though fried tofu may not be all that healthy I can't help but coming back for some favorite tofu dishes. Now Chopsticks isn't a fancy place or a big place at all. There is little room for many people to dine inside but they provide a few tables and chairs if you must sit inside. Not really favorable restaurant environment so I typically pick up food to go or on occasion if I'm dining with a friend or boyfriend we get our food delivered. (Spending over 12 dollars is their delivery requirement)

 I love their orange tofu saucy and flavorful and gives you that fried goodness fix. It's also vegan and not cooked with chicken powder or uses any other animal products. The only bummer is that it's served with white rice and you can't subsitute for brown rice. I've had their veggie chow mein(or noodles something along those lines), which is alright but sort of boring but, their honey tofu(which I've heard is not made with real honey but you may need to check on that one) and sweet and sour tofu (which isn't on the menu but they're happy to make for you) and is also delicious. They have a few other tofu options including ones that are not fried and better for you (But I dig the fried!) 
I couldn't find an official website for them but you can find their menu online if you google it that has all their items. They are willing to change things to make them vegetarian or vegan friendly so that's a plus!

Everytime I've ordered something it was pretty satisfying. I basicially get my usual but it hasn't let me down yet! Also their eggless rolls are vegan!  They also have soups, other sides,  as well as lunch specials (that don't apply to the veggie lovers items sadly :( )  It's by no means fine dining but it's a quick yummy fix of chinese food for both vegetarians/vegans and non-vegetarians alike that you won't get sick of and about a billion times better than panda express. Also Chopsticks is a  small business that has been running for awhile and should definitely be regonized for making their own food and including something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Love ordering from here, the food is great and the service has never disappointed. The tofu is the best I've tried in fast food."}
{"text":"Crappiest Chinese food ever. You call that fried rice?!?"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Chinese food. I've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant ever since I moved here in 2008. Happy to find these place. Portions and meals are huge. Tried the beef chow mein and my friends had the veggie chow mein and chicken and vegetables. Would definitely recommend the vegetable chow mein."}
{"text":"We ordered veggie chow mein and egg foo young and veggie chicken for my roomie. 
The food quantity is great! U get lots of food for a $6 avg menu. 
The egg foo young is very tasty with right spices. The noodles are very crispy and the fried rice is not bad too. 
The downside and reason for taking a star off is it bland. I've had chinese at other places where they have right amounts of salt n chilli. They need to work on that. 
Other perks include just 12$ for a free delivery which is great. U order a starter and main course and they get it to u for free! 
I've had regular coupons in mail box and they do discount stuff. 
So if ur looking for something cheap and need something heavy, order from chopsticks. U might need to make some modifications with salts and peppers/ sauces based on ur taste buds!! 
Happy eating 
Chop chop"}
{"text":"I grew up around the corner from this place and use to go all the time. I love it. its a typical Americanized Chinese food but very good for the type of Chinese is it. I love the House Chow Mien. The owners are really nice and they deliver also which makes it nice. I like the fried rice and the egg drop soup also. I would recommend it if you are close by. This place doesn't blow my skirt up or anything but still yummy."}
{"text":"I was really craving orange chicken and was disappointed that this chicken was really soft and not crispy like at other places. 

The beef in the beef and broccoli looks questionable so I only had one bite. 

I really liked that they delivered quickly, which was a plus. 

Next time I'm in town, I'll order elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place and order from them regularly. They have never messed up my order and their food is always hot and delicious upon arrival. They give you tons of food for your money too. A combo will feed me twice. I really recommend this place to everyone. The people who work there are super nice too. They offer me water while I wait for my food. And they are always very fast at preparing my food too. Really this is one of my favorite places to go and I always have a positive experience whether I walk in or order by phone. (Must try for vegetarians too!! Try substituting the crab puff for an extra egg roll when ordering a combo. Such good stuff!)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Chinese food. However, I don't typically go out to eat Chinese food without craving it and I've only ever had it delivered twice. Estimated delivery time was an hour, took 40 minutes but hey, at least they deliver cause that's a plus in my book! I get these menus on my door constantly and finally decided \"family combo $25?! Okay why not!\" The family combo comes with crab puffs, egg rolls, white and fried rice and your choice of 3 large entrees from the list provided. I chose orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, and chicken chow mien. In the middle of waiting for my food I decided to read these reviews and immediately wished I had read them before ordering. Delivery guy was friendly and all went well until I checked out the food. I really like my orange chicken to have a crispy crust, that's part of what I crave when I'm craving it. This was more like the cheap kind you buy in the freezer that never gets crispy enough in the oven. It was edible, but not what I was really craving. Sweet and sour pork was the same way but also the pork was kinda firm like it was overcooked. Chow mien was good but I'm like 70% positive they didn't even use chow mien noodles, they were so thick. As for the rice, the other reviews are right. The fried rice is white rice with a sauce. I haven't tasted the rice (it's in my fridge) as I don't typically eat a lot of rice with my Chinese food cause we already eat a lot of rice at home regularly; but it was obvious just by looking at it.
Egg rolls were good but a little mushy. The crab puffs were probably the best part of the whole meal, but they had a sweet aspect to them. Not sure what it was and never tasted it in a crab puff before but it was more of a surprise than off putting and I enjoyed those and wished I had more than 4.
Overall, I would probably never order from here again. I will eat the food as it is edible and no reason to waste it but it did not satisfy my cravings for crispy delicious Chinese food at all.
If you aren't picky about your food/Chinese and you need a lot of food for $30 without leaving home and this is your only option then sure go for it but if you want quality Chinese food, order elsewhere even if it costs more. I've gotten the same amount of food for a few dollars more from China Express on Dobson and Baseline and that was definitely good Chinese food especially for being ordered close to closing time."}
{"text":"This was one of the first chinese restaurants i had when i first moved here about 2 weeks ago. I had this order delivered to me but it took 45 minutes to recieve. The gentleman was very nice though. However, it cost alot more than i would have liked to pay and had the worst general tso I've ever eaten. The only thing i ate was the crab ragoon and the rice."}
{"text":"We ordered the Kung Pao chicken and the chicken & broccoli. Fried rice was bland. However,  the main dishes were so overspiced with garlic. There were actually fresh chopped pieces of garlic in the sauce. It was like eating small bits of carrots! Won't be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Yum!  I have been here a few times for take-out and have been happy with my meal every time.  So far, I have tried the Thai Tofu, the Spicy Tofu and the Honey Tofu.  This is my new favorite Chinese take-out joint."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a friends recommendation, and all I can say is WOW!  The food is amazing! (I'm still eating as I write this!)  Everything is perfectly seasoned, fresh, and cooked to the peak of flavor.  I ordered the Orange Chicken, Beef Fried Rice, Mongolian Tofu, Crab Puffs, and Spring Rolls.  I am in Love and will never settle.  The delivery time was great, and the driver was really nice.  Will definitely be ordering from them again.  My Belly is happy!

The only draw back was that I had to guess at the menu, as they have no website, or Facebook where I can look over and choose my dinner items. My friend told me they have anything a normal Chinese Restaurant would have.  So I winged it, and am still happy."}
{"text":"Good food and great prices!


The food was good and it sure hit the spot. The shrimp chow Mein was my favorite"}
{"text":"I ordered Sweet Sour Chicken, 
the portion is unbelievably small, chicken is dry.
Asian Cafe is a much better deal as far as value and flavor."}
{"text":"I got a flyer on my door so I thought I'd give them a try.
I was really surprised when I called and the girl who answered spoke fluent English which is a plus. She was a little rude but I dealt with it. I placed my order and waited for the delivery... and waited... and waited... almost 2 hours later it was delivered. The price that I was told on the phone was less then what the delivery driver tried to collect from me. 
Aside from the rude order taker, the price difference, and the delivery time the food sucked! The sweet and sour pork was soggy, the rice was hard, and the beef was like leather. 
The best thing and only good thing about this place was the egg rolls... they were better then most places."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this restaurant another chance, since ordering delivery before was a wreck. The customer service is great but when it comes to the food....I ordered delivery again and got almost like a kid sized meal for lunch. 3 pieces of shrimp and a small porotion of rice... and the shrimp seemed like it was sitting out for a little bit. Sorry, not going to order again, even with the coupons and ads they always leave at our door."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite Chinese place in Tempe and really Phoenix at that. They are very consistent and the food is always fresh. I don't feel like I get a container full of grease with this place. I can't say enough about this place. 

The drivers and staff are always friendly as well. Small place to eat in at but its great for small parties. I usually order for delivery tho and if I was ever out of their delivery zone I would likely drive to pick-up just to ensure I get good food."}
{"text":"New to the area and wanted Chinese delivery. I ordered the crispy Thai shrimp combo. I was very disappointed. The fried rice was bland and dry. The shrimp had so much breading on it that when I finally got a bite of shrimp I was shocked. The delivery driver was nice. 
One positive is their egg drop soup. \"It was hot and hit the spot\" according to my friend. Her sweet and sour pork was dry and excessively breaded also. I think they ran out of batter mix on these 2 orders. Fail"}
{"text":"I'm so supportive of small business, it's terribly uncomfortable for me to give a poor review.  Others may have and as reflected here on Yelp do have other opinions...

Anyway, wasn't really intending to stop by here, as I did review the comments here on Yelp, but was in the area and hungry, so... took good ole Kung Pao Chicken to go, counter person asked my spicy number and I said 7...

Relatively huge pieces of chicken sitting on top of the container containing the entree, not mixed through the stir fry, also large pieces of bell pepper, etc.  Was spicy, but taste for me was very unpleasant, and found myself setting it aside as a food loss.  Steamed rice also had an odd taste, and I set that aside as well, and I can live on basic steamed rice...

Wish I had spent the $8.59 at Albertsons across the street, and gotten the 8 piece fried chicken and potato salad :(

Definitely will not re-visit."}
{"text":"I really wish someone on Yelp would have written about Chopstick Express's gluten free items.  They are in fact not gluten free at all, and the food is of an overall low quality.  Just avoid."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had I would never ever ever ever ordered that stuff again made me sick I threw three quarters of"}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! They got the order wrong and when called about it they just argued. We paid for $30 worth of food and most of it ended up being just plain old rice! The food is bland tiny portions. If you were like me....really hungry for some good, well made Chinese food.....do yourself a favor and find a different restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic establishment. I've been eating here regularly for probably about a year and a half now and I have had no complaints. I almost always get the Pork Fried Rice, which is always fantastic. Yeah, it takes a little while for them to get the food out, but that's only because they are making it fresh.

Keep doing you, Chopstick Express."}
{"text":"Small shop in an older building community. Noticeable effort to maintain cleanliness and welcome customers with a television and nice lighting. The customer service was welcoming, efficient and sufficient. I ordered Orange Chicken and Crab puffs. I drove home and by the time I got home the crab puffs were soft. That was alright, they may have been better fresh (not restaurant's fault). The Orange Chicken sauce was excellent. Great use of carrots, could have used some more kick. I would recommend adjusting the recipe to using a light almost tempura batter to coat the chicken, not the breading that swallowed the chicken. The breading was mushy and soft. Which took away from a great chicken meat base and a great sauce. 

Noticeable effort to increase traffic. They send frequent advertising to neighboring communities with good coupons! Good service & honest effort. (also they deliver :))"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered delivery from Chopstick Express and although we didn't have super high expectations, it still disappointed us. The delivery time was decent (about 30-45 minutes), and prices were pretty good (about $20 total for both meals), but we still felt it was a waste of money.

I ordered sweet and sour chicken, and he ordered crunchy chicken teriyaki. Both came with fried rice, an eggroll and a crab puff. We didn't really like any of it. Overall, the ingredients seemed to be of really pool quality. The rice seemed old, and my husband's chicken teriyaki was so disgusting (very mushy and syrupy) we threw the entire dish away. My sweet and sour chicken was the best thing we ordered (because it was actually edible), and it still was among the worst sweet and sour chicken I've had.

Not recommended. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back not the best Chinese take out I was actually really disappointed :("}
{"text":"I tried to warn my coworkers that I had ordered from them and got undercooked pork, mushy sauce covered unknown, a lot of bland flavorless goop, and finally a surprisingly good orange chicken.
They didn't listen and tried anyway. 2 of them got sick and most of the food was thrown out.
Bad."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many low star reviews. Glad I took a risk and ordered. Delivery was pretty timely. I gave it 4 stars because I wouldn't say it was A+ cuisine but I definitely enjoyed my meal. They give you a lot of food and the price is great."}
{"text":"First time here today and I already can't wait to come back. Orange Tofu was amazing!! So crispy and good. Crab puffs were good too. Service is very very friendly and fast! thank you"}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! There is too much breading on their \"crispy\" teriyaki chicken. And I think the chicken is on steroids because there's no way it can be this big. I can feel stomach cramps arising. Ugh"}
{"text":"MY REAL STAR RATING IS 0 STARS

I will make this review very quick.... I wasn't expecting this food to be bursting with flavor and just out of sight delicious.... I was expecting it to be good average Chinese food..... I was totally wrong..... 

I called in my order for delivery and I ordered sweet and sour chicken and the Hunan beef with an extra egg roll and it came with crab puffs.... Lets first start off with the sweet and sour chicken..... It was drenched in sweet and sour sauce and the sauce was way too sweet....it had huge chunks of pineapples in it.... it was soggy and disgusting..... I prefer to have my sweet and sour sauce on the side.... 

The Hunan beef was nasty it was dry and cold and it wasn't spicy at all.... The veggies were Blah.... The crab puffs were soggy and the egg rolls.... They weren't even egg rolls they were more like spring rolls but they still sucked..... They were horrible...!!!!! The worst egg rolls I ever ate in my life.... I would prefer Panda Express any day over this place.... The rice was dry and disgusting....

This food made me sick.... After eating just a couple bites a few minutes later .... My body immediately rejected it and it upset my stomach really badly.... I ended up releasing the food immediately through a bowel movement.... My body has never reacted like that before.... It felt like I had rocks in my tummy.... I felt weak and nausea and I believe I had a very short case of food poisoning..... Thank God I only ate a few bites...  or I probably would have been sick for a couple days.... 

My suggestion is that they need to be closed down.... THEIR FOOD IS HORRIFIC....!!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a dive and I would not recommend eating here but they do offer speedy and cheap takeout.  They serve up what you would call American style Chinese food.  None of their dishes really stand out to me as being especially good except I do like their Lo Mein noodles.  I know some of the other reviewers called them greasy and I suppose that is true but I guess that is just the way I like it.  Especially cold the next morning... mmm... that's good hangover food.  Yes?  Anybody?  I can't be the only one that does that..."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Chopstick Express 4/5 times and i think it is reasonably priced and has coupons every so often. The food is typical Chinese takeout it's not gourmet by any means but it's good when you are hungry and don't want to cook. Can be messy and running but they don't skimp on portions. Delivery time is decent and payment is easy. Will continue to order every so often."}
{"text":"Fast.  Cheap.  Chinese food.  Not much else to say."}
{"text":"I've given this place 2 chances. The second time I was so disappointed that I called to talk to the manager who gave me a bunch of excuses and did not want to hear what I had to say. Will never order here again. The prices are too high and the food is bland."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted chinese food last night but I didn't want to drive anywhere, so I reluctantly ordered off of this brochure that had been sitting on my fridge for months. 

There's a $12 minimum for delivery, so I got the orange chicken combo and some potstickers. The lady on the phone was nice and she said it'd be about 55 minutes. 45 minutes later my food arrives, I split it in half, and dive in. I would definitely rank this below Panda Express, and the leftovers were a bit better imho. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The orange chicken lunch rice bowl was very delicious and so were the egg rolls. I will defiantly be coming back."}
{"text":"Its truly awful. Wonton soup looked and tasted like dirty dish water. Id give it negative stars if i could."}
{"text":"I ordered two different lunch specials from this restaurant so that I could have leftovers for lunchs and dinners at work. I ordered the Mongolian Beef combo and the black pepper steak combo. They were good but not fantastic. The meat in each dish was really good but the vegetables were either over or under cooked and the fried rice was very plain. The crab puffs however were amazingly great! Delivery was quick and the driver was friendly! The price is right and overall I was happy with my meal(s) I would recommend this if you're looking for a quick delivery meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Their honey tofu is heaven!!!!!
I am an avid tofu eater and its beyond amazing"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM

I have been dining at C.E. for several years now and have always gotten the DELICIOUS honey tofu (ask for it extra crispy). 

We used to go in here 2-3 times a month but have not been as much recently because me and the man are on diets. Too much deep fried tofu :)

This is a family run place and the daughter can normally be found up front, and the son makes the deliveries. They are super nice!

Really good lunch specials, and I have been with a few non-veggies before who have gotten some other items.

This is not a high class place... more like a take out Chinese place with some tables to eat. They do have some cool track lighting, but like I said, you are not dining in luxury.

The only reason I do not give it five stars is because they have Pepsi products (I'm a dc girl) and you have to walk around back to use the restroom and it is not the... nicest... bathroom in the world.

REALLY GOOD FOOD!"}
{"text":"It took forever and they gave me moldy chicken. See pictures. Not eating there again. VERY DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"Had chopstick express a few times over the year, and i keep thinking that next time will be better. I was wrong, over priced and less food compared to other Chinese food restaurants"}
{"text":"Found this place from one of the menus they left on my apartment door. I'm usually skeptical of places that do that but I was feeling sick and really wanted some wonton soup so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. I got there and decided to order a small chicken chow mein as well. It also came with white rice which was nice since many places charge extra for rice. The chow mein was awesome, not overly greasy or salty, and the chicken in it was really good quality. The biggest problem I have with many Chinese restaurants is poor-quality fatty chicken (and other meats) but this was delicious white meat. The wonton soup was also great, not too salty like some places, and the wontons were delicious as was the pork inside of them. Overall, if I'm looking for some relatively inexpensive Chinese food, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Yuk! Edible, but not good at all. We were in the mood for fake Chinese tonight and had a flier from this place. We ordered quite a bit, and no one really liked anything. Egg Foo Young--overwhelmingly garlicky. Crispy Noodles with Chicken--the same style of noodles that you get out of a can. You get the idea. 

The second star is due to the fast service. 

We had been considering ordering carry-out from Mandalay Noodle World, which we tried a few days ago and liked a lot. But, not finding a menu online, we went with this place. Big, $45, mistake."}
{"text":"Confession: I am an obnoxious asian food snob. I really try to take that into consideration when I rate places. I haven't lived in China or anything, but I really, really love eating chinese food. 

I also hope to convey to you that I am still American at heart. I hate Panda Express, but I truly, truly worship an excellently prepared orange chicken. 

Be that as it may, there are instances in which I have to suspend my courtesy toward less-than-perfect food because the product that I received was not only poor quality, but insulting relative to the price I paid. This is the experienced I received ordering from Chopstick express.

I ordered Chopstick Express' family special for me, my roommates and an incredibly hungry foodie friend of mine whom happened to be over. Upon reaching an orderer, it was refreshing, though annoying, to be talking to what seemed to be an obnoxious teenager being forced to take orders. Whatever, water off a duck's back. Quack quack. We ordered orange chicken, cashew chicken, and brocoli beef, which came with fried rice and egg rolls. It was supposed to come with crab puffs, but they were not delivered, which I felt was almost an insult.

All the food we received was lukewarm at best, cold at worst. It's chinese food. It can hold at nuclear temperatures, and I don't think it snobbish of me to assume that delivery people can afford to invest in a proper traveling method. I must admit, my major problem with this is the fact that it took nearly an hour for the delivery person to get here. Which means assuming that the food left fresh, it spend a half-hour uninsulated. I don't believe I'll get sick from this food, but considering that being served very hot food is clearly the industry standard, it still seems sketch at best, and disgusting at worst.



I digress. At any rate,  the food was as follows:

Orange Chicken: The pieces of orange chicken were about the size of medium-sized chicken tenders. They were then covered in a weak breading, fried unevenly, and covered in a tolerable orange sauce which was the only saving grace of the dish. It came deeply compacted in a chinese take-out paper box, which was problematic for this dish because the chicken essentially came out in giant clumps. 

Brocoli beef: Easily the best dish, but only by reason of advantage. The brocoli was tender, though strangely bitter. The beef they chose to use was akin to stew beef, which is the really thick, fatty cut used in crock pots for stews because they have the capacity to cook for ever and ever amen. This resulted in incredibly large, chewy chunks. I gotta admit, Panda owns brocoli beef, and chopstick express could take a few pointers. The sauce was decent enough, yet ultimately forgettable.

Cashew chicken: offensive. bland, strange. The sauce seemed to be more like cream of chicken than the savory, peppery sauce to which I am accustomed. I ate maybe two cashews in my share, which is boring. Interesting to note was the presence of noodles in the dish, despite the fact that we were also given rice. And peas. Peas? 

White rice: Nearly impossible to mess up, and only when exceptional is worthy of meditation. Average rice, though served essentially at room temperature, which dried the rice out.

Fried rice: Shocking. In case you read my review, Chopstick Express, please take note: your fried rice sealed my distrust of your food safety practices. Fried rice is cooked fast and hot, but because of the quickness of the cooking, never dries out. This looked burnt. Literally burnt. Or seasoned with something both bland and dark as all holy hell. Fried rice should not appear to be dried out, burnt, and dark as chocolate. 

Egg rolls: I don't trust these. They were almost cold to the touch.

Crab Puffs: not present in my order. THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE. D:

Summary: Steer clear away from this place at all costs. The advantage of living so close to Mekong Plaza means not being terribly far away from decent chinese and vietnamese food, and I feel like I have disappointed my tongue by attempting to branch out. If these strange in congruencies aren't addressed by the management of Chopstick Express, I worry that, like what happened with me, they will lose crucial local business and be forced to close. I don't know, maybe it was an off-day. But in my opinion, if something takes an hour to get to my place when the drive is 10 minutes tops, it better sparkle and wow. Chopstick Express, in its disparaging food, disturbing distance from food safety and respectability, and excessive delivery time means that I will never eat from them again."}
{"text":"Delivery was prompt and the driver was extra friendly. When I placed the order online I gave specific delivery instructions and mentioned I had a coupon. They applied the coupon and followed all instructions happily. The food was really tasty with generous portions. Price was excellent and if I ever visit the area again I would be a repeat customer. I had the crispy tufu which was really good being as I never ate tufu before in my life. My guy had the beef and broccoli both with fried rice. Yummy. Included with the combo meal was an egg roll, crab Rangoon or crab puff as they call it and a fortune cookie. I really enjoyed the fried rice because I do not care for veggies in my rice and this only had great flavor, nothing else added. Oh, included in my delivery bag were bowls, condiments and silverware which came in handy."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food place!!! I order from here at least twice a month...  The potstickers and crab puffs are awesome and I really enjoy the pork chow mein and sweet and sour chicken! I'm never disappointed with their food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food Chinese restaurant in town.  I have been going there since late 1999 and have never been disappointed in anything that I have eaten.  I have drove from all areas of the city to din here when I crave Chinese.  Always a warm welcome and an ample supple cuisine."}
{"text":"Thought we'd give it a try but kind of regretting it now... The orange chicken was really dry, the broccoli and beef didn't taste very good, the fried rice tasted as if it was drenched in soy sauce... Will not do again."}
{"text":"They seem nice enough but the food is bad even by take out standards. My chicken was over salted and so much mushy breading. I threw out the rest. Ordered the pork salad thinking it might be like Larb and it was nothing more than shredded cabbage with the same old pork as in everything else."}
{"text":"Best tofu I've ever had. No competition. Hope this place stays in business forever. Try the orange tofu and the veggie chow mein. I dream about it."}
{"text":"Crab puffs are good and sweet. The Garlic Shrimp was tasty and not salty. The General's Chicken was interesting. I think it could have  been prepared on the sweeter side. The Honey Chicken was a bit salty.

Staff is friendly and food was ready in a jiffy."}
{"text":"Good lunch Chinese food, they deliver also.  It is nice to get out of the office though for a hot meal.  :-)"}
{"text":"It was edible got sweet and sour chicken it was to sweet I won't be back. I asked to use the restroom it was around the back of the restaurant if I wasn't pregnant I wouldn't have gone. It was behind a door outside of restaurant it was scary, dirty and dark. If you are defenseless don't go it was terrible and anyone could have been on the other side if that door.  I won't be back here terrible."}
{"text":"My go to place for take out. Love it! I get the orange chicken and crab puffs usually and never been disappointed.."}
{"text":"Best chicken chow mein ever. Tender, flavorful not greasy.  Great egg rolls and their tofu is outstanding.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"We've ordered a few times from this place because we got menus with coupons on our door.  The Family Meal coupon is a good one, but we no longer receive the menus on our door, so we called to see if they would honor an expired coupon and were told \"don't worry, I can take care of you\" on the phone, so we placed our order.  
The coupon is for $22 and change, so we were surprised when we were told our order was $30 before we hung up.  We decided to show the delivery guy the coupon and explain what the guy on the phone said, but he wouldn't honor the coupon.  So, we called and were told that the guy on the phone didn't write the coupon down so the discount didn't get applied and, furthermore, that he never said they would take an expired coupon.  I call BS!!  I HEARD my husband on the phone and our order was contingent on them taking the coupon, which I informed them, but again the discount was refused.  
These are some very shady business practices and their food is not outstanding, so they just lost our business over $7 and their crappy customer service.  How is the food?  Mediocre.  The husband said he's had better at Panda Express (ouch!) and his plate of Cashew Chicken has 2 cashews and is very onion and green pepper-centric.  Thankfully, Tempe has an abundance of Chinese food outlets; goodbye!"}
{"text":"Horrifying!

I tried Chopstick express because they deliver to my apartment. I was going between it and another place--what a mistake.

I ordered Sweet and Sour chicken and moo shu veggies. Everything smelled great when I got it but I was keenly dissapointed just by opening up the boxes.

My moo shu pancakes? Tortillas. I'm not kidding, actual tortillas. Not rice paper, or won ton wrappers. Tortillas. And as I opened up the box with the actual veggies in it, it compleatly broke and smashed all over my carpet.

Moving on. The quality of the chicken was the worst. My first bite was filled with fat and the veggies wern't even cooked. (Huge pieces of raw pepper and onion). 

Absolutly horrible, I will never, ever order from here again. It was a waste of 23 bucks!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Chopstick Express. I liked their chow mein a lot. Much less oily than other places and good flavor. The other dishes were okay, but maybe I wouldn't order them again. It took a little longer than expected (about 45 min to one hour), but they did tell me that when I made the order. The food was decent, but the takeout boxes were leaky and there were no napkins. The steam from the food turned the paper boxes into kind of a mush, so I had to transfer the food into bowls with ninja-like speed and dexterity (kind of defeats the purpose of getting delivery, doesn't it? To not have to do as many dishes?) Also, they didn't give me any chopsticks! What the heck! It's in their name! Good thing along with those ninja skills, I've also got chopsticks up my sleeves. Hai-ya!"}
{"text":"They are quick and convenient for local delivery.  Standard fare for Chinese take out.  The food is good not amazing.  But they are friendly and fast."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE !! My boyfriend and I ordered this last night cause we didn't want to drive anywhere so we ordered take out . My boyfriend threw up the food in the middle of the night . I will never return ."}
{"text":"Ideally I would give Chopstick Express 3 1/2 stars. The food is great if you're expecting typical Chinese food take-out. We usually order the eggrolls (a little bland but the texture is great), pot stickers (I'm a fan), a soft chow mein dish (typically yummy, not bad, but not out of this world) and a chicken dish (General Tso or Kung Pao - both of which are satisfactory). 

There isn't much to say other than it's absolutely average and sometimes that's just fine. 

Delivery times vary, I usually receive my order 35-40 minutes after ordering, only once did it take about 55 minutes in the evening.

My only complaint is that I feel it's on the pricey side. I always try to wait until they've delivered a menu to my door with a 15% off coupon, otherwise I don't find it to be a great value.

Overall, good enough and convenient for those nights you want to stay in and curl up on the couch with a horror film."}
