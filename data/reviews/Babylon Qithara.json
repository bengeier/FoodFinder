{"text":"I visited Babylon several times while visiting Calgary, and my feelings on it have ranged between decently good to really good. 

On a few visits, a couple of elementary school aged kids were the ones assembling my order. It's nice to see them getting in on the family business, but they should be more supervised for better quality control. They couldn't seem to get my kibby hot. The adults who work there have a better command of microwave use.

What keeps me coming back is the chicken shawarma. Whether wrapped in pita, topping a salad, or as a part of the platter, it is very tasty -- especially topped with tahini and hot sauces! 

I wouldn't go out of your way to try this place, but if you're in Eau Claire and hungry, it's certainly a worthy option."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Price point is questionable. Quality is average. Better options if you go deeper in to the core."}
{"text":"I discovered Babylon Qithara thanks to Wendy P.'s recommendation when I was looking for veggie-friendly places in Calgary. Eau Claire market was conveniently across the street from my hotel, so I made a dash over here as soon as I checked-in, to be able to fill my hungry belly.

When places have a \"veggie\" plate (or some variant), it makes it simple for me to decide. What a great way to try a variety of things without having to do the [sometimes laborious] task of narrowing down the options myself.

The veggie plate was quite good--you get a choice of two types of rice, and falafel or eggplant. I couldn't chose, and was able to get half and half of both options! (Though I did get a bit of a funny look for this indecisiveness.) Potatoes, two salads (one cucumber, one tabouleh), and two \"dips\" (hummous & tzatziki) also come with it. It was filling and delicious. The eggplant was a little greasier than I expected, and the whole dish was probably not quite as healthy as I originally was anticipating, but that's quite okay. (Check out the picture I uploaded if you want to see what the veggie plate looks like.)

There was a constant line of customers, it moves fast, but you may have a bit of a wait depending on what you order. It looks like all the food is ready and you should be able to go after they spoon it onto a plate for you, but a few items needed to be heated (or have some other work done), which did take a couple extra minutes of waiting around. The guys behind the counter were very nice. I would come back on a future visit to Calgary!"}
{"text":"Got 2 donairs today to go and was very very disappointed.  Not only did they hardly put any sauce on my husbands, I hardly got any meat and the meat I did have had like thick dry part on the outside and tasted funny... I also was surprised to find a long piece of hair in the middle of my donair.  We paid 17 bucks for 2, threw them out and went out to get something else.  

I wanted to like this place, but for a first visit to have so much wrong with something as simple as 2 donairs, I'm not 100% sure we want to even bother trying this place again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fast.  If it weren't for the garlic aftermath, I'd eat here everyday"}
{"text":"Our office's go to lunch spot has always been excellent in customer service, quality of food and value for your money. 

I have yet to have a bad experience here and always go back to work well fed and satisfied.

Chicken shawarma wrap and Shish taouk are right up their with the best in the city.

It is also a good spot for when family n friends are in town...they all leave very happy and satisfied.

Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"This place very pricey & serving portions very small. I had to wait long for food to get ready. Very expensive compared to how much they provide. I won't go there again !"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant twice in 2 weeks. Is now my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Calgary. Food is delicious. Lots of variety. Servings are big. And prices are reasonable. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food! They have a quite few options for vegetarians too. I've been there multiple time and love the felafel and eggplant wrap."}
{"text":"Babylon Qithara has a huge menu including wraps & platters.  Service is always quick and friendly and the food is tasty.  I would put it a bit on the pricey side.  I wish they had more of a lunch menu.  Overall, a great place & their fried eggplant is SO GOOD."}
{"text":"The Most Amazing Donairs I can find in the City of Calgary!!!   LOVE THEM!  All the other food looks incredible too and I would love to try it... but I can't pull my self away from ordering the Donair when I am there.  

Most Definitely worth Checking out!! =)"}
{"text":"Mediocre Mediterranean seems to be the theme for many of these food court Falafel spots. Tabbouleh didn't taste fresh, my plate was overloaded with four heaping scoops of rice to make it look like I had tons of food, and I got attitude for not wanting feta on my salad. 

I'm sure the Falafel would've tasted much better, if it wasn't rubbery in the center from being microwaved. The flavor was there, but the texture was narf. Take a pro-tip from Lifehacker, BQ. Put a glass of water in with the Falafels if you must microwave it, so they don't take on the texture of bedpost chewing gum.

Still, reading all the raves from friends, maybe I caught them on an off day? Maybe, I'll come back and try the eggplant."}
{"text":"Being out-of-towners, we were looking for something exotic to satisfy our palette.  Babylon Qithara seemed like just the place.  Our experience started out great.  We were seated and placed our order which was described in the menu.  The manager that took our order that evening implied that the Banya dish I had ordered came with rice or naan.  And when the check came, I was surprised to find that the rice was not part of the dish I ordered, but instead, I was charged 8.99 for the rice, which was the same price as the entire dish I had ordered!  The waitress and the manager were very dismissal towards me and my surprise at being charged for what I did not intend to purchase.  And even if the rice was supposed to be a separate item, it came as a complete shock that a portion of rice would be charged 8.99.  I felt duped and not respected as a customer.  Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"You fed me and my colleagues almost every weekday for a month. Couldn't be happier with the food, service and environment. Recommend the large beef donair and pop for 8.99. Great deal. Also, Shawarma plates are very good.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm a definite fan! I go here all the time - has to be one of THE BEST chicken shawrma places in the NE. 

The chicken is very savoury and flavourful. You can make it spicy, or sweet (or a combination - my pick). Service is often quite quick and it gets packed at lunch hour. Great for take out or for large groups to enjoy lunch.

{"text":"The place could do a little more about cleanliness and facility improvement.

The food is good and inexpensive, but the feel and comfort are comprised. I liked the wraps and kababs but will prefer take-out rather than dine in."}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised that out of all the trips I've made to Eu Claire, I've never really tried Babylon. So I finally decided to try them on a sunny Sunday afternoon.

I ordered a Donair plate to go, which came with fixings of rice, veggies, and the usual bevy of sauces Mediterranean food goes with. The Donair was juicy and flavourful but I was also impressed with the side dishes. Usually most places easily botch their side dishes by making the silliest mistakes: leaving the rice out to dry or overspicing and overcooking the vegetables to hide their lack of freshness. But at Babylon the side dishes were made with just as much care as the main attraction, which made the whole meal worth the experience."}
{"text":"I love the Iskender kebab plate! It's so good but they only make it on certain days hence the 4star rating! They shud make it every day ESP because I drive from the other side of the city for it!"}
{"text":"the mix kebob plate was ok, but 20$ for a reg plate was meh.  The wrap was just meh."}
{"text":"Been to many middle eastern restaurants and this is below average.  Ingredients were not fresh, the meat didnt taste that great.  Hightlight was the pita bread wrap.  Skippable experience."}
{"text":"Great Lunch, went with a friend recently and I was very happy with the food. It did take longer than I expected as I saw that they have all the right set up to be a bit faster, nevertheless it was worth the few minutes extra. The food was not just good but was amazing. I tried a platter, which came with potatoes, rice, chicken, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita. I did order a couple drinks which they forgot about, but again it's in the part of being busy and having systems that could work a bit faster and more efficient. I'm being too picky! I will return soon as I really enjoyed the food, and the price was right!"}
{"text":"Surprising delicious fast food at a Mediterranean food counter at the Eau Claire Market.  Large 8 inch beef donair and pop for under 8 dollars. The girth on this baby is amazing, it also depends if you like girth... Stuffed with tons of beef, fresh tomatoes, pickle, olives and sweet sauce, I was more than just satisfied.

Baklava here is tres expensive at $4.99 for small sizes; even Ouzo had larger ones at $1.99.  Staff is friendly, funny and he used plastic gloves when serving, appreciate this detail."}
{"text":"\"I'll have a donair plate please\" I asked after I had spent a few minutes perusing the menu on my lunch break at a weekend fair. I wasn't sure how the donair plate was different than the donair wrap, except that it came with some sides to make it a meal rather than just the donair.

As it turns out, there was no wrap involved. The donair plate is a plate full of rice (your choice of spicy or non), veggies/salad and sauces with donair meat cooked up and piled on top. Didn't see that one coming. While this wasn't quite the same as having my lamb all wrapped up, it was still quite tasty... and Babylon sure didn't skimp on the rest of the food. 

All in all, a satisfying and quick lunch in Eau Claire Market!"}
{"text":"I am on the hunt for the best Shawarma in Calgary...and this place is very good.  I enjoyed the service as much as the food and I recommend Babylon Qithara for delicious shawarma.  
The sauces were fantastic and the pita bread was served warm.  
If you go for a quick bite, then you'l be able to get in and out quickly and if you want to enjoy a sit down meal, they have a full menu from which you can choose a meal."}
{"text":"Great place for a snack or main meal. It wasn't the greatest spot for big crowds, we had different meals coming out every 10 minutes.

The food was tastey, great quality of meat."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for lunch and they are alright. I consider myself something of a falafel connoisseur; it's the first thing I order from any new Middle Eastern place I go to. Their falafel itself isn't that impressive. It is a little bland and also dry. There are no special sauces or toppings they use in their wrap (from what I can tell). However, I have also tried their mixed eggplant + falafel wrap and that one is much better than the plain falafel. In conclusion, an ok alternative for lunch but definitely not my go-to."}
{"text":"To be honest i have no idea why this place is rated 4 stars.. worst place ever.. small portions, all condiments looks old. Nothing to say against the employee really nice."}
{"text":"Amazing Arab food! The servers are very cheerful and they serve such fresh food. Try their home made bread with spicy hammouz, it is simply the best!"}
{"text":"Calgary is a city renowned for it's shawarma. Unfortunately Babylon Qithara is not up to par. 

The server put on way too much lettuce, and just not enough of the good veggies I like (banana peppers, pickles, pickled turnip, and tomato). The meat came out of a steamer box instead of being freshly shaved off the rotisserie, like most places in the city. And lastly, the server put way too much hot sauce on when I asked specifically for a small portion. However, the hot sauce ended up being the best part, because the rest of the ingredients were practically flavorless. 

Overall it was a bad experience. I guess it's my fault for trying shawarma at a food court. If you're hungry in Eau Claire market, just walk on by this place and try something else. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in here because we are into Mediterranean food and it looked like a good deal. We saw there was a chicken Shawarma meal deal on. My girlfriend and I are vegetarian so we asked if we could get the same deal with the vegetarian wrap which is actually a dollar less and they refused. We then got samosas which were clearly heated up in the microwave and not very hot and a mixed veggie wrap which was cold and did not meet up to expectations. I would not return."}
{"text":"I freely admit to not being able to pronounce the name of this place, but was pleasantly surprised to see them on a day I was going \"Avonning\" by Eau Claire. It was hot out, and I wanted a drink, but of course I couldn't pass up on snacking on bakalava while I was it. The guy behind the counter had a pretty good sense of humor and I could see there was quite the variety of other foods, but I gotta have my deep-fried honey goodness :d"}
{"text":"Ordered the mixed Donair plater. Comes with a generous portion of beef and lamb on a bed of plain and spiced rice with a Greek salad and 3 dips: hummus, garlic and tziki with a basket of some pita bread all for under $15.00. Salad was fresh, rice and meat flavorful and dips were amazing. Will go back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I Love this restaurant. He used to own Babylon by 24th st in the s.e., the food is so awesome...my favourites are their rice and musaka (eggplant) its all vegies...really good.
their salad is awesome as well. everything is just yummy. the chef who is the owner takes pride as to what he does. shawarma is great when you are in a hurry. 
also, their fries...OMG super good. and the serving is big. you will definitely be full. if you havent been there....you are missing out.
they are near by the sunridge spectrum. not only awesome food, awesome service and very friendly people."}
