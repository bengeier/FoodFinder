{"text":"Sucked the manager or what ever her title Renee was running around and seemed liked everyone was uptight! Won't be back"}
{"text":"I liked the waitress she was nice. However did not enjoy the food. Didn't like their house Italian. Not sure what they put in it. The croutons were saturated with butter. The wedding soup was similar with Eat N Park. The chicken piccata was ok but the sauce could have had a bit more of a bite. The manicotti tasted like it had been frozen. Don't get the raspberry chicken."}
{"text":"I go there often and have never had a bad meal. Everything is homemade especially the soups. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The other day I came home and the wife heated me up a huge slice of pizza which I thought was fabulous but the sauce was nonexistent. But the dough cheese and toppings were great. So fast forward a few weeks and we all wanted to go to Trafford and sit down and get this Pizza. And I was completely stunned the waitress was a complete joke and that was putting it lightly. She would disappear for very long periods at a time. When she did eventually came we had to ask numerous times for simple items. Seams like anything you needed like a glass of water or a refill on ice tea or maybe a lemon or two went in one ear and out the other. Then eventually I had to wave down another waitress or what turned out to be a so called manager,sometimes we might receive it. There was four of us and wanted to share the pizza and salad. And again we waited so long for a few extra plates and an extra dressing or two. My sons raviolis were cold probably sat for a long time while we waited on pizza. I looked around and the whole place was just moving backwards it wasn't just us getting horrendous service the whole place was. The final wait was receiving the check which took about 20 minutes then she disappeared waited another 20 minutes and waved down this manager to please cash us out which then I told her this place is a complete joke. I'm not sure how you stay open. And she responded with the most Absurd excuses like we have a party of 50, good food takes awhile and that's why we put on our menu that this is not fast food. Lol don't waste your time unless you have 3 hours to burn and you want to be bored out of your mind. You will never catch us in this restaurant again. Do you self a huge favor and call a few hours ahead and just pick your pizza up."}
{"text":"Had a great experience.  Good home made Italian food and very reasonable.  Will definitely be back.  Recommend ham cabbage soup if they have it and fried dough with powdered sugar."}
{"text":"Very nice Italian restaurant.  Consistently good food and service.  I eat there often with my family."}
{"text":"It seems this place will be either hit or miss. This time was a miss!  My wife's shrimp was dark, chewy and over cooked. My cannelloni was good, but wedding soup, just mediocre. Waitress did not know what the specials were. I asked for a box for my leftover piece of bread and she picked it up with her bare fingers and put it in a container for me. What?!?!  I asked for dessert forks and she forgot after 10 seconds.  She also talked too much while I'm trying to eat.  I'm not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Have been going to this restaurant for years.  It is my father's favorite place he picks it every time we're going out to dinner.  They do have good meals and large portions with a nice atmosphere.  The owner Ren√©e is working the floor most nights and the staff is wonderful all the hostesses and waitresses are fantastic.
I think the meals are very good and you get a lot for your money.

The restaurant was recently updated and is kept very clean.  There is no smoking in the restaurant but there is smoking in the bar for those of you who smoke or want to watch the score of a game.

They have nightly specials.  Adequate parking also involved with the theater down the road where they have dinner and theater specials."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Parente's in years. We can for dinner many times and used the back room for parties. It's change inside a little, they made the lounge/bar larger. 

The food was always just ok. This visit however the entree was very good. The Wedding soup as a little watered down for my taste, lacking any broth taste. The Italian salad with green beans and toasted garlic toast croutons where very good, and I am not a ice berg lettuce person. I liked the garlic toast. The chicken fingers and fries where hot and very good! 
The entree, chicken par, manicotti and fettuccine was very good. 
The menu has chicken and manicotti with lasagna but for some reason No lasagna. Our server was very accommodating in changing the entrees and it was very good ! 

I always loved the ladies room - with a little one I was disappointed they have No changing station and laying the baby on the sink was a little rough. 

We do recommend! And we will return"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Always HUGE portions at affordable prices. My favorite is the chicken parm. It comes with a side, soup, bread, etc.. The staff is also very nice. It is a family owned restaurant that has the rustic, homely scene that is lacking from many restaurants nowadays.

Parentes identity is its family atmosphere with large portions and friendly staff. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is up for an adventure."}
{"text":"I have eaten there for many years when run by founding parents and it was a 5 star. They are dead now and a married daughter is the manager.

It is a joke now with amateurs in the kitchen. There seems to be a younger staff now also.

I recently got what they called lasagne and it was a mess. Only 3 layers of noodles, runny filling with no balance of cheese to meat. Worst was the 1/2 inch of mozzerella covering the top. The noodles just slid all over the plate. Very amateur attempt. My grandkids did better on their first try!

I also recently had what they represented as \"braciole\". It technically was because it was meat with stuffing. The problem is the extra thickness of the meat made it tough and chewy. Round steak is inherently tough and in Calabria at least, it is tenderized by pounding or beating it very thin. It is sold thinly cut in some stores, but still requires a good pounding to break up the muscle fibers.

Seeing a family business lose its luster is not pretty. I would recommend passing at this time. Management apparently did not get the message from parents on how to consistently cook and serve acceptable Italian Food for the public."}
{"text":"8 of us had dinner here last night.  Waitress was not knowledgable, the wedding soup was the worst I've ever tasted - if I had to identify the taste it was half lemon broth! The garlic bread was burnt, the salad was of poor quality. Two of us ordered green beans as a side dish and they were generic \"canned\" beans with nothing on them; we were expecting fresh beans, imagine that! After an hour wait for our entree's most of the them were over cooked and served lukewarm and we had to wait another 5 minutes for the last entree to be served so that we could begin eating.  What a disappointment this was for a what was a rare get together for our group.  This $200.00 meal was our treat to our other guests and I was embarrassed to have chosen it.  I've eaten here once before and it was pretty good - something was very wrong!"}
{"text":"Well judging from the reviews so far, you're either gonna luv this place or hate it. I stopped in last night and bellied up to the bar. I was greeted cheerfully by Sara the bartender who got me the most interesting thing they have on tap, a Peroni, and notified me that Wednesday nights are pizza night. For $5.00 you can get a ten inch pizza with two toppings. Although that sounded like a deal to me, I just wasn't in the mood for pizza and opted to order from the menu instead. 

It took a while for me to narrow down what I wanted. As the name would imply, Parente's Ristorante features Italian cuisine and the menu has lots of different yummy sounding offerings.  After much internal debate, I decided on the veal scaloppini which came with a choice of a side, garlic bread, a soup and a salad. I had a choice between wedding soup and chicken noodle. I went for the wedding soup... It was tasty but only luke warm. The salad was what you'd expect out of a salad only larger. My side of green beans were just that, green beans... nothing fancy.  Although the veal scaloppini was not at all what I expected -- a generous portion of veal strips smothered in a tomato-ee sauce with onion, red and green bell pepper slices and parsley sprinkled on top -- It was delicious. It was just not what I expected. 

Despite the smoking at the bar, I think I kind of like Parente's Ristorante. The menu has a wide selection, the prices are reasonable and Sara the bartender is pleasant and attentive. Was the meal and a 16 oz draft of Peroni worth the $20.41 plus tip that I spent on the meal? I think so. Does this place deserve 5 stars? Not in my opinion... but I wouldn't give it a one star rating either. It's somewhere in between for me. The prices and service are very good, the meal itself was good, the beer selection takes it down a notch but the smoking is a big turn off for me. I'm not wanting to discourage anyone from coming here; the prices alone for a solid Italian meal make it worth the stop.  I'd say it's a solid three star Ristorante with potential for more."}
{"text":"Some foods better than others; but all or most still done the old fashioned way, cooked when ordered."}
{"text":"once again my in-laws came in from Florida and they had to go to our favorite restaurant.  I was as GREAT as ever.   I just love the sauce....and all of the food."}
