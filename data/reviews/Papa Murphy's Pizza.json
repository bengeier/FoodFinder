{"text":"Frequent this location at least once a week.  Today, we were a little disappointed with quality.  Dough uneven and toppings a little sloppy.  We'll be back because we know this location can and has done better.  Hopefully though, we won't have to drive the long ways back to the Warner Rd and Val Vista location."}
{"text":"Love them!!! Yum! Great people and what's best that taking a fresh pizza home? Salads are awesome too! Never ordering delivery again"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Service.....Incredibly professional. The young lady that worked the cash register understands professionalism and should be recognized as a huge asset to that company. Thank you for making my experience amazing!"}
{"text":"First off I love papa murphy's pizza....however I was not happy with my pizza... everything was in the middle not spread out and it looks bare...I gave 4 stars because the place was clean as always and the ladies were nice....but need a little help with making pizza that actually like the pics or at least closer...."}
{"text":"Why on earth would I give this place four stars you ask? Pizza snob that I am. From Chicago as well.  Because for $5 you can pick up a Pepperoni Favorite deal any day of the week. I think they also have the deal for Sausage or Sausage and Pepperoni as well but, I'm just buying the base.   Instead of paying $10 or more for extra ingredients you can take home the \"Fave\" and put whatever you want on it.   We add our own mushrooms, onions and peppers. Or whatever else we have in the fridge about to go bad if we don't eat it in the next few days.  The only better deal is when Sprouts across the street has a half price sale on Home Run Inn Frozen Pizza."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed.  I ordered a pizza with pepperoni, green peppers and cheese.  I requested red crushed peppers on the right only.  Well imagine my surprise when I came home to no pepperoni with green peppers on half the pizza and red crushed peppers on the entire pizza.   I guess this is what happens when you have  teenage girls running the counter.  I mean where is the manager.  When I walked in the place was empty and the girls were standing around talking.  Meanwhile the place wasn't clean.  There were toppings all over the counter.    When I called, the chick didn't even apologize.  She only said I can give you $5.00 off your next pizza.  I don't want $5 off my next pizza.  I want my order correct.  I ended up driving back to the location for them to add the pepperoni.  This is my first time dealing with an issue with Papa Murphy's.  It was a silly mistake because someone failed to read the ticket correctly."}
{"text":"This was third visit to this location, I have never been dissatisfied with my experience. The pizzas have always baked perfectly, the staff is great to engage with.  Keep up the great food and having such an outgoing staff!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience as always. Fresh ingredients and fantastic thin crust pizza.  Friendly service"}
{"text":"What a great idea for a Pizza.  They prepare the Pizza and then you take it home and put it in the oven.  The food is fresh and nice and hot.  We purchased a large Pizza with all the trimmings, salad and prepared cookie dough.  The food was great and then we had fresh oookies for desert.  All for only $20.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this Papa Murphy's several times per month.  Since the change to have mostly high school staff with no managment around the quality and customer service has deteriorated.  I asked if a special price  included the vegie pizza that eas on their menu board. She replied that it did.  As she was making it she put very few vegies on the pizza.  I asked if she could add more, to which she agreed.  When they rang up the charge, the price was double the special price.  I asked why and she informed me that double vegies were not included in the special.  The pizza is now made and I am payin over $16 dollars for a vegie pizza.  I questioned why she didn't tell me when I asked for more and she replies with a snide remark.  I ask for a manager and she said he wasn't there.  I left the store and went to a different pizza shop.   This is just one example of the downturn in customer service.  I hope that management reads this and makes a change."}
{"text":"Papa Murphys pizza is worth the price and effort to pick it up. Kids love the double cheese pizza. The staff  in Chandler are always helpful & friendly."}
{"text":"Not a bad place if you are looking for a value pizza dinner.  I've been here only once, but it was just fine. Service wasn't amazing, as it was two younger girls that were having personal conversations. It wasn't anything professional, but I didn't expect anything more with it being two younger girls honestly.  I got my pizza in a timely manner. The pizza was ok. Not a whole lot to say about this place as its a take-out restaurant. The place needed a decent cleaning, as the floors were pretty dirty. Its in a nice location though, and doesn't seem to get busy that much.   I might come back here once more, and see if I can get this place up to a 4 or 5 star review :)  Restaurant cleanliness 2/5 Service 3/5 Food taste 3/5 Value 4/5"}
{"text":"I am truly a pizza snob since I grew up in the Chicago area! Deep dish pizza is king in Chi-Town, but I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this super thin crust pizza! My husband and I doctored it up by adding more cheese, bacon and onions which took it over the top!! I must say, I was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Called in during the day and my wife went to go pick up the pizza 5 minutes later and it was ready! Pizza is delicious and on Friday's they have $5 pepperoni or sausage large pizzas, such a good deal!"}
{"text":"Since this new location opened a couple of months ago, we have been there several times, and it has been consistently impressive! On top of their friendly, patient staff, their pizzas are amazing. Their pizza pies actually look like their advertised photos! Their toppings are always fresh and piled on. And their coupons in the mail are an added bonus. Oh so good!!"}
{"text":"We normally always get a great pizza with fresh ingredients from Papa Murphy's. However, I am a bit concerned with the spinach on our latest pizza. Just before placing the pizza in the oven I noticed some very slimey spinach. I pulled the pizza apart to pull out all of the spinach (a lot of the spinach was in  wet clumps). Though the spinach may have been fine, it was certainly unappealing and we didn't want to risk it.  We expect fresh ingredients from Papa Murphy's and we'll certainly watch the ingredients closely from now on."}
{"text":"Great pizza for every taste.  This has become a regular fixture for us. The great ingredients and fresh from the oven taste and texture is well worth the effort to go and fetch. Lots of great choices but we can't get past the Chicken and Artichoke because it is simply that good! The wait can be modest but simply order ahead  and by the time you get there it is ready."}
