{"text":"I rarely ever give a restaurant 5 stars because something is almost always lacking but ML Tavern was the perfect meal in a perfect setting.  We vIsited on a recent August evening and had a fabulous meal and excellent, friendly service.  Two of us had the huge 1 pound lobster tail and another guest had the wonderful grouper.  Simply put, the entire meal was fantastic from salad to coffee.  I swooned when the waiter brought us the delicious French Press coffee - just another elegant touch at this beautiful establishment.  You will need to bring plenty of money for this dining experience since everything is a la carte.  No matter what you order do not miss the lobster mashed potatoes - which are outrageous.  This is a special occasion place and if you don't have one in the next few months you can make one up.  This is one of the best restaurants anywhere."}
{"text":"Overpriced food that is just mediocre at best. They need a new chef...."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! We ordered appetizers and I Loved the tuna tartar. It is a Hyde Park restaurant so your salads and side are separate but large enough to share. Lastly the deserts - altough I didn't think the had a wide selection the 4 of us order their banana cream pie.  It was a pie - NOT A SLICE OF PIE!  All 4 us had plenty."}
{"text":"We visited ML Tavern 11/5/15. The service and food were excellent. The scallops were sweet and tender. The filet was cooked to perfection. Everything was steaming hot and delicious. The atmosphere was warm and friendly. Our server, Linda, was stellar. Definitely will return. Love the table by the fire."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic  birthday dinner tonight lemon sole and sweet potato hash! Our server Linda made our night she was great!"}
{"text":"ML Tavern is a nice evening out on the town. Love the happy hour and their Moscow mule. Their crab cakes are filled with wonderful flavor and the presentation is beautiful.  Sides are a la carte but they feed two then some. Our server was friendly and was informative about drinks and the food!"}
{"text":"RIP Fountain.  Where did the fountain go anyways?  So it looks like Lisa and Kelly might be a couple of Hyde Park ringers.  I am not, but I still think this place is pretty good.  I can only speak to dinner and desserts, not the food.  While it was crowded, the bartenders are top notch, attentive, and quick.  Ice for whiskeys and scotchs are pressed from large cubes into a large ice ball using a press.  In this manner, your drink does not become diluted with melted ice cubes if you are picky about that sort of thing.  I thought was a nice touch.  Drink prices were high but not outrageous, kind of what you would expect for an upscale bar.  Meals seemed to be around $30, more for steaks.    Decor and crowd - It looks like a rich white guy's country club with paintings of fox hunting on the wall.  The clientele is definitely older.....much older.  Cougars are on the prowl, so are their parents it seems. I can't take points away for the crowd notmatching to my own demographic, it wouldn't be fair to a well run place. Tallyho!  You have to $3 valet it on Friday night.  Kind of a ripoff for a suburban strip mall.  Maybe things will die down a little, it was opening weekend."}
{"text":"Fabulous  Food!! Great decor!!! Excellent service. I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this for our Valentine's dinner.  We had 8:15PM reservations and arrived pretty early (6:30PM) so we could be one of the first couples seated for our reservation.  We found two seats at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine.  The bartenders were fabulous, friendly, outgoing and genuinely wanted you to have a great experience.  If I were only reviewing the bartenders and bar service they would get 5 stars.  Around 7:45 my husband checked in with the hostess again just to remind her we had already arrived for our 8:15PM reservation.  She wasn't very kind and blew him off.  At 8:15 he went up again to let her know we were there and to check on our table.  She said it wasn't ready.  We sat at the bar until 8:45 when we were finally seated at our table.  There were many people seated ahead of us between 8:15 and 8:45 so we weren't sure what was going on.  Our waiter apologized.  We knew our food choices and ordered once he arrived.  I ordered the bone-in filet cooked medium and my husband ordered a lemon caper sole dish.  Both were very underwhelming.  My filet was overcooked and had very little flavor.  The sole was not that flavorful either.  The lobster mashed potatoes were excellent though.  We were disappointed and felt this was the worst $200 dinner we have had."}
{"text":"been there twice over priced, bad service, had veal once, never again and pizza the next time cuz it's just hard to screw up pizza.  won't be back"}
{"text":"Great bread, brought to your table in a little iron skillet; uneven but attentive service; odd banana cream pie dessert with granola crust; superior wine list; classy decor; salmon was less than 4 ozs. for $21.99.   All in all, ML succeeds in appealing to the Hunt Club crowd without really wowing"}
{"text":"Excellent meal! Loved the Wedge salad,Filet and Pork Chop were perfection on a plate. Loved sitting on the terrace...elegant,not as noisy/busy as the main dining area.Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I hover over the stars on Yelp! and see that five stars says \"Wooohoo, as good as it gets!\" I often hesitate and ask \"Was it really?\". Therefore I am more of a four-star guy. In this case five-stars is absolutely deserved. From the moment we spoke to Steve (who we later learned was the GM) to make our reservation right up until we pulled away from the valet stand after our evening at ML we felt spoiled and oh so well taken care of. It was indeed a dining experience! We could go on and on but instead will just say \"GO!\". Leave some time for a cocktail at the lovely bar and be sure to save room for dessert. It's sure to be a wonderful evening out."}
{"text":"We have been to ML Tavern once for drinks and on two occasions for dinner.  Each time we sat at the bar.  The bartenders are oustanding - hip and entertaining.  Our appetizer (chorizo stuffed peppers) was delicious.  I had the lemon sole both times because it was so good the first time, I had to have it again.  My husband had the halibut once (outstanding) and steak once (also outstanding).  I would highly recommend ML Tavern for a great dinner and a fun bar."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  LOVE that they accommodated my being VEGAN!  They made me an amazing vegetable dish (not on the menu) with mushrooms, brussel sprouts, corn and shallots and spinach.... YUM!  They even offered to have the chef come out (which I said wasn't necessary).  The staff was friendly and attentive and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very good. I've been a fan of the Hyde Park bunch for a long time and they are staying true to form with M.L. Sat at the bar and had apps, carpaccio and an Ahi tower sort of thing, both were very good- the ahi could have been trimmed a little better as it had some chewy fatty parts left on but who really gives a shit, it was good. The beef carpaccio was great, from what I could tell it's the same one they have on the Hyde Park menus but it's good so why mess with it. Anyhow, you should definitely make a stop at M.L Tavern. It's on point"}
{"text":"Heard lots of good things about this place, but the food is meh. I ordered the ML burger and Cesar salad, my burger was burned and Cesar salad was okay. Our server was very rude. When we were placing our order, he kept pushing the wine and questioned several of our guests' orders. It took long time to get our food and they were dismissive when they forgot to bring several side dishes out. The only good thing about this place is probably the decor."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. Went on a Friday night.  Had a reservation and could see my table waiting, empty. Still took server 15-20 minutes to get me seated.  Server was too young and inexperienced for this scale of restaurant.  Ordered the steak salad.  Steak serving was small, and cold!  Cold like it had been sitting out all day.  Server recommended the wine special by the bottle.  Lame.  Rip off.  Only redeeming quality of the place is the atmosphere and location, otherwise stick to Red, XO Prime, or Hyde Park for steak and service."}
{"text":"Beyond excellent. This place deserves 6 stars actually.  Tastefully appointed bar and dining room. Bartenders are cordial and make very good drinks.  When we were seated I was instantly offered a black napkin (my fave attention to detail in nicer restaurants) so they instantly won me over.  We sat in the dining room and Dave took care of us.  He had a great sense of humor. He is a consummate professional.  For starters, the Parker House rolls that arrive in a Staub mini pan (my fave cookware by the way so that made me smile) are killer good.  A thoughtfully placed pat of butter sprinkled with pink Hungarian salt and some other type of herb was incredible.  The soup was corn chowder and it was the best in a restaurant I have ever tasted.  I opted for the deviled eggs...again, delicious.  I ordered them as my entree and they accidentally brought them as an appetizer. I didn't mind, but Tim, the manager was on the scene within minutes to whisk it away and say the chef will make me a fresh plate, and bring it out with my husband's entree.  Yeah, talk about attention to detail and professionalism.  And then we were given a complimentary chef's tasting of tuna served atop a chia-sprinkled plantain with rice and with a few dots of sweet soy sauce. Yum.  The hubs ordered the ribeye and we shared the grilled asparagus.  He said it was the best ribeye he has ever had.  And I think you know where I am going with the asparagus... yep, delicious, with a nice hint of smoky char from the grill.  Top notch wine list but it also has some approachable offerings as well.  Around 8pm on a Saturday the dining room and bar were packed but the atmosphere remains very conducive to table conversation.  Such an amazing place.  The attention to detail, quality of food, creativity of the dishes...I will say this is the best place in the Cleveland area, and I am so glad we live 10 minutes from here because we will be going back many, many times."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in the area. Every dinner entrée our party of 8 enjoyed was better then anyone expected.  From streak to fish to pork they hit it out of the park. The banana cream pie is awesome ending and enough for several people.  Yes it is a pie..........not just a slice.  It is a small pie but worth every bite.  Service is top draw and every attention to detail is met.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Needs to have more vegan food.  Since all they had were meat dishes, I did order steak well done.  They had a hard time figuring that out! Did give us a free desert, but I really just wanted to eat with my family when they ate. Also parking is a nightmare.  Who would put two restaurants that are BUSY in one small plaza,  You can always park at the office building across the street and walk.  Just hope it's not 20 degrees."}
{"text":"My wife and I ventured out through a terrible snow storm to fulfill date night and we were amazed at how good everything at ML Tavern was. We cannot wait to go back to continue to explore the menu.   The service was impeccable. Among the best."}
{"text":"I picked this place based on yelp and a Local feel.      Grouper was Excellent ! Brussels sprout yum. Great service and most impressed with Creative inside - Built in a strip mall.        Would repeat"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this spot.  Particularly in the winter months.  It's very cozy either at the bar or in the dining room.  The steak is obviously top notch.  The Caesar salad is fabulous.  It's a just a great meal and staple rotational restaurant that is always consistent."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place. I've been twice and the service has always been outstanding! The dining room is rich and warm with high-end decor. And the food! Wow, this past Saturday I ordered the trout almondine with brussels sprouts....it was delicious. My fiancee ordered the black grouper that was cooked to perfection, moist, well seasoned, and beautifully presented. The bartenders are personable, refined, and make great drinks. Valet is complimentary and fast....I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is top notch except for one thing. How does an owner build  a restaurant , beautiful in every detail and then have ONE restroom for women? One toilet. I had to wait outside of the restroom - didn't want to lose my spot - and after a quick trip there were 2 gals lined up. Seriously???"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Great rib eye steak one of the best I have ever had, great service, crab cake and filet mignon were also excellent. Pricey but worth it at least for special occasion."}
{"text":"Good service,  good food. We only had appetizers and a side dish but we're relatively happy with our selection"}
{"text":"My experience at ML was stellar. From the ambiance (we sat outside) to the food. Best lobster crab cake ever. Huge chunks of lobster and no fillers. Our server was warm and professional. My husband was gifted a piece of cheesecake for his birthday, it was made in house and delicious. Though it can be pricey depending on what you order and a special occasion type of place, we didn't think our bill for four was bad at all. They have a casual burger type menu too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and very professional service.  From servers to management,  everyone was wonderful. Steak was cooked perfectly,  fish was beautifully done too. Prior to this I had only sat at the bar (and had a great experience there too),  table service was done right. Will definitely be back and would definitely recommend.    Only negative element are the valets who are consistently very surly.  Same crew that work at Flour I believe. Guessing it's an outside company and is not a reflection on ML's quality."}
{"text":"Stop! Wait a minute! This place is just amaaaaaazing!!!  Keith, the Manager is a pleasure at the door or table side. Bambi makes delightful drinks and...well...the food is just a dance on the palate. Whether, it's the happy hour or the regular menu, all is a dazzle for the taste buds.  If weather permits, do sit on the enclosed patio where the side curtains are lifted and you can enjoy the outdoors while \"indoors\". I love everything about this place whether coming off the golf course in sports gear or dressed in my stilettos. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a \"suburban restaurant\". Steak is the way to go, although they have a good amount of seafood and fish on their menu. My favorite dish hands down is the beef carpaccio appetizer.  ML Tavern is affiliated with Hyde Park. I initially had worries about the steak as Hyde Park in Beachwood had been off with getting the temp right on their steaks recently. The steak here however, did not disappoint and had everything one could want in a steak -- a well charred, caramelized outer shell and a juicy, tasty, marbly interior. They had served it hot with the \"doneness\" right on the money that night. There are different sauces to choose from, and this one was served oscar style, topped with bernaise, asparagus and crab meat. Trout Almondine was well-executed with the skin very crispy on the outside, yet retaining the sweet, flaky texture of the fish.  The place was well appointed and made to look like an English Pub with the wood paneling and all. There is outdoor seating, and free valet service which I felt was pointless other than maybe to give it a high-end feel. Our server was attentive and friendly.  Overall, I'm a fan and will come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary with dinner at ML. The atmosphere was perfect and the waiter, Alfanso, was very attentive to our needs. We started off with an appetizer of wagyu beef and crab carpaccio which was very tasty. I ordered the Salmon which was about the best I've had and my wife ordered Grouper, also outsta nding.Our side of spinach  gratin was awesome. Finally for dessert the restaurant surprised us for our anniversary with a slice of flowerless chocolate cake, awesome and we ordered a slice of butter cake with a scoup of ice cream, delicious. Although the prices are on the high side you get a lot of value for your money. In my opinion this is one of the best restaurants for atmosphere and food quality."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place I really did, But the food was fairly generic, the cocktails were not balanced well, the kitchen was slow, they forgot my side dish, the server was very rude from first greeting to questioning a vegetarians order to constantly kicking our chairs and bumping into us to tossing my bill at me. I could go on but honestly this place isn't worth spending any more time on.   Will NOT Be returning :("}
{"text":"Food is good, but not great.  For the prices charged it should be great.  Managers visited every other table to see how the meal was, however totally ignored us.  That's o.k., since we plan to ignore ML."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and will not be our last.  We arrived around 1130am for brunch and were seated promptly after a very welcoming greeting from the host.  Our server,  Ashley,  was pleasant and even made us laugh a few times.  Even with all of the great service,  the food was really the star. I had French toast, quite possibly the best I've ever had.  He had steak and eggs.  The restaurant was full but there was no delay in any part of our dining experience.  It was great."}
{"text":"Not impressed by the food or the enclosed patio where they sit people under heat lamps during the winter.  The valet parking situation is hilarious - this restaurant is surrounded by a parking lot...I suppose the 60+ crowd that frequents ML appreciates saving the wear and tear on their walkers.  ML tavern: where the geriatrics of the east side go to see and be seen."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an absolutely gorgeous interior, but that's where the magic ends.  The food is mediocre, the prices uber-expensive, and the service is flawed and inconsistent.   My husband, mother-in-law, and I dined here a couple of weeks ago on the later side of a moderately busy evening.  Our server was cloyingly polite in a very fake way, and while that normally wouldn't bother me if everything arrived at the table as we ordered it, sadly, that did not happen.  He forget to include the olives on the martini we ordered and we had to ask repeatedly for items.  The bartender was also apparently having an off night, because my partner ordered a classic sidecar (cognac, triple sec, lemon juice), only to have it arrive having been made with lime juice.  This is a rookie mistake, and when you're paying that much for a drink, it should be made expertly.  We ordered the \"ML Wedge\" salad.  It was slathered in gobs of sickeningly-sweet french dressing.  Sigh.  I cursed myself for apparently not having read the menu closely enough, because to me, a wedge salad should have bleu cheese dressing, not french...and no salad should arrive that drowned in such an overly sweet dressing!!  It honestly felt like something I'd wind up with at an Applebee's.  The steaks here arrive a la carte, which is ridiculous to me, considering how expensive they are:  My ribeye was $45.......just for the steak.  Not even a tiny scoop of mashed potatoes, a stalk of broccoli, nothing.  Worse, I ordered my steak on the blue side of rare, and instead it arrived past medium-rare, closer to medium!  Again, when you're paying this much for your food, it should be made correctly the first time.  That says to me that the chefs don't pay attention to the food they're making, and given that the entirety of my dish was one simple thing, a steak, nothing else, that's a crying shame.  I didn't send it back because I didn't want to wait another 20-30 minutes for my food while everyone else at my table ate...but honestly, it was a tremendous let-down, and I felt angry about having to pay so much for something so unappealing.  The only part of the meal that didn't dash my expectations was the side dishes, which are big enough to share.  We ordered the gorgonzola mac'n'cheese, which was addictive, and the carmelized brussel sprouts, which were also tasty, if not terribly over-priced.  The desserts here are gigantic (you essentially get your own 5-6\" pie) and can easily feed 3-5 people, depending on your appetite.  Sadly, they are also somewhat bland.  Look, I've been to some rather swanky steak joints in my time, and ML Tavern simply isn't one of the greats.  The price tag might lead you to believe you'll be getting the Real Deal, but despite the beautiful interior trappings, it's a mirage:  Once you unwrap the present, you'll only find a cheap, plastic toy.  In fact, in my opinion, the only way to properly enjoy this restaurant and feel like you've gotten your money's worth is if it's going on the expense account.   I would not go here again, nor would I recommend it.  I'm sure there are far better steakhouses in the Cleveland suburbs, and I intend to find one!"}
{"text":"Expensive, but worth it.  Outstanding food and service.  Valet parking charge is a ripoff.  This isn't Chicago or NYC.  Increase the prices, if necessary and absorb the parking.  Great meal.  The veal chop Milanese was one of the best I have ever had.  The service was excellent.  Valet parking is now complimentary-a real plus for a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a few people from work. The decor was amazing and very impressive. When i made the reservation, i asked for a table inside. WHen we arrived to an empty restaurant, they put us at a table outside covered in rose petals and asked whos anniversary.(yup they messed up the reservation, but will remember they do this when i have an anniversary dinner) Service was what you expect at a high end steakhouse. Waiter servicice was great and our meal went off with out a hitch.. Started with devil eggs, which honestly that could of been my meal, 3 or 4 orders and yup id be happy, but hey were at a steak house lets get steak. 3 out of the 4 of us ordered the filet which was perfectly cooked, and the sides of brusselsrouts and potatoes went quickly. The only issue with the meal was the one person who ordered the fish.. It came out half cooked/half sushi. We didnt mention it as we were all kind of hungry and my colleague ate around the raw part and left pretty full. We will go back next time we need our steak fix."}
{"text":"can't believe that this restaurant is part of HYDE PARK GROUP.....i really don't like any of their restaurants, until now.  decor is akin to an english men's huntclub with lots of plaids, dark woods, rich velvet drapes, etc., but still as a feel of a pub. drinks are delicious and well made, food is very, very good, but everything is a la carte which means if you want more than a small piece of fish on a plate for $26, you'll need to add a side dish for an extra $9-$18 which feeds at least 2. all the appetizers, salads, entrees and sides we all chose were excellent; ahi tuna tartare, oysters, carpaccio, lobster cake, wedge salads, tomato salads, halibut, salmon, creamed spinach, lobster mashed potatoes, and garlic mashed potatoes. i can't thing of one thing i didn't like or wouldn't order again! service is super friendly,even having birthday cards signed by the staff, left waiting for us at our table when we arrived! a nice touch! our server, linda, was funny, friendly and attentive. i would highly recommend this restaurant to anybody in the mood for delicious, well prepared food served in a cozy, casual atmosphere! this restaurant is all that blake's seafood and hyde park grille would aspire to be!!! try it out!!  one note.....if the patio is open, sit out there....stunningly well decorated, one of the nicest i've ever seen!!!"}
{"text":"I love throwing 5 stars at a deserving establishment and ML Tavern earned its strips on a recent business trip to the East side of Cleveland.   Recommended by a fellow Elite Yelper-friend from from Northeastern Ohio, ML Tavern is one of three well-regarded eateries in the Beachwood-Moreland Hills area owned by the same group.   With an early reservation, our evening started with our server Adonis telling us a bit about the restaurant after determining that we were out-of-towners.  The vibe here is comfortable...an unpretentious yet clubby feel w/ rich and colorful oils tastefully covering the walls. Loved it!  At the suggestion of the sommelier, we started with dynamite Pino Noir...a 2013 Adelsheim from Oregon's Willamette (damn it) Valley...clean water for sure.   We tried a trio of amazing appetizers including the Veal Sausage Stuffed Hot Peppers, an Ahi Tuna Tartare Avocado Cocktail and the Baby Heirloom Tomato & Mozzarella Salad. All drew raves.   For entrees, our group tried two versions of Simply Grilled fish including the Florida Grouper as well as the Rainbow Trout from Boise, Idaho.   We complimented the entrees with sides of Steamed Broccoli, Fresh Shucked Roasted Grilled Corn and the crowning blow...a bowl of Maine Lobster Mashed Papas.  Wow!    What an over-the-moon combo of atmosphere, service and fab food!  The ML satisfied in every way possible. Check out the delicious pictures."}
{"text":"My last review was 5 star, this is  one.  My chickened parm was 50 percent breading. What is about $7 for pasta w/ parm?  My wife's shrimp pasta special tasted like shrimp that has been around for a while.  She could not finish it. I mentioned to the bartender that it was freezing in there. She ignored that. It is a beautiful place with food tonight less than  Bravo or Brio. 5 and and 1 = 2 1/2."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for a Valentine's Day/Anniversary dinner. All I can say is wow! We were greeted with a card wishing us a happy Anniversary- which was so nice. The food was incredible, and our waitress had an on-point recommendation for a wine to perfectly compliment my meal. Then, as a gift for our anniversary, they brought out a complimentary slice of amareno cherry cheesecake that was simply to die for. This will definitely be our new spot! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Had dinner Saturday evening. My wife and I sat at the bar and had a great time.   The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. We enjoyed a great wine during dinner. My wife actually had a burger which she said was great. I had the strip steak and it was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  This was our second visit there and it is definitely on the list to return to again."}
{"text":"All I can say is...get the corn, man! The side dish of corn alone is worth coming to ML for. The service is expectedly impeccable and the food is good to sublime.  Ambiance is kinda weird because a lot of the restaurant is in what used to be a patio and is now like fine dining in a circus tent, but I rather like it.  Not a cheap meal, but consistently well done every time I go there."}
{"text":"I imagine this as the kind of place Charlotte York-MacDougal (10 pts if you get the reference!) would be spotted at, had it been in NY's countryside. The decor boasts a well appointed masculine flair that is both elegant, yet comfortable.  The attention received upon entering is by all means noteworthy, they actually take your jacket, and offer you seats at the bar if you are waiting for others to arrive. They also acknowledged our friend's birthday and delivered her a hand-signed card from the staff! It's a wonderfully warm and welcoming place indeed.   At the bar, the cocktail offerings are creatively fashioned using locally sourced spirits and many unique pairings. You won't find glowing red Maraschino cherries on a neon pick here. No instead, you get these tiny little deep plum colored amarena cherries that will rock your world.  The bartenders are well versed in the art of making a cocktail and also have a well rounded knowledge of their wine selection.   As we were seated in the most impressively crafted outdoor dining space that I have ever seen, the ambiance of the space really sets a romantic tone. Mind you, we live in Cleveland, and its full on winter, yet we were toasty warm on the patio! A well thought out plan and some magic clearly helped execute this uniquely adaptable room.  Our table was fireside, which also added to the night's charm.   The menu is diverse without being overwhelming and the rolls that are brought to the table are pillowy little puffs of goodness. The salad offerings are varied and interesting. The freshly toasted croutons on the Cesar are to die for and the house-made french on theWedge adds a uniquely satisfying twist.  Either are worth trying for sure. As a table of carnivores, we all indulged ourselves with filet mignons of various sizes and temperatures. All were cooked to perfection and served with outstanding accouterments. The Bearnaise sauce was a great addition!    The side dishes are intended to be shared, and generously portioned. The Caramelized Brussles and the Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese were out of this world good. Both mouth-watering sides were chock full of flavor and beyond amazing.  I have a feeling that all of the sides would fall into this realm of tastiness.   After eating, our birthday girl was delivered a piece of pumpkin cheesecake that was subtle, yet rich. The velvety creaminess of the dessert was also not to be missed. We had also ordered the Butter Cake to share, and were all pleasantly surprised by its fresh-out-of-the-oven temperature. It paired well with the vanilla ice cream and it too helped refresh our taste buds after such a savory meal.   I would say that ML Tavern is not only a Must-Go for anyone seeking a great night out, but it will become a regular in our rotation."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant experience.  The food was wonderful tasting. The staff was very accommodating. I had the bone in ribeye that was Perfect. My wife had the Lobster cake and it exceeded her expectations as well. Don,t miss those massive sized sides they also are great.  Had the banana cream pie and it is your own pie so share all you hogs.   :)  What a special night for my Wife and I Ty ML Tavern..."}
{"text":"I personally loved the meat. But they need more vegan dishes for my wifer or I won't be going back till I go with the boys.  I thought the price was average and servers good. Got lucky on a weekend and no waiting 4 table."}
{"text":"Service was good except our waiter told us about the specials and I had my heart set on the halibut, only to find out from someone else that they ran out of halibut the day before. I got the pecan crusted grouper instead which was slightly overlooked and thus dry. I should have known since it took forever to get our food. At least the server was very apologetic. Oddly, the butternut squash that came with the grouper was grossly undercooked! What I really didn't like, however, was we were a couple dining out, clearly looking for a quiet dinner. But who gets sat right next to us? A family of 6 that included a baby who not only flung her broccoli everywhere but had recently \"found her voice\" and was screaming every chance se got. The mother made no attempt to quiet her. Whoever sat them should have sat them in a corner away from everyone else. ML Tavern isn't a family dining place. Diners want peace and quiet. If we wanted noise we'd have gone to TGIFriday's. Bad decision making on ML's part. It ruined the evening. Overall, as far as the food goes, it took far too long to get and was inconsistent with overlooked grouper and undercooked squash. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The first time I was there it was great.  Tonight was the second time, and the filet was totally over-cooked the first time, totally raw the second time.   They finally tried a third time and it still sucked.   The server forgot my drink twice, the second time I saw it sitting at the service bar for 15 minutes.    If this were my first time there, I would never think about going back, but since my previous visit was very good, I will give it three stars.     I will try it again, but it won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful!  Delicious food and excellent service!  Loved Linda!! She was so sweet and very professional.  We will be back for sure.  I had a filet with horseradish sauce, it was amazing.  Great wine too."}
{"text":"As I sad in my last review - amazing patio terrace! They have the most comfortable seating for a restaurant. The terrace is shaded from direct sun, but is open air on the sides which is great. It is designed as an outdoor room and is really cozy.   For starters I ordered the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio. This was very good and some shaved cheese and a small salad with a horseradish dressing was served with it.   I also tried the Veal Sausage Stuffed Hot Peppers. These were a bit disappointing as the dish was not spicy at all. The dish was good, but did not have anywhere near the amount of spice I was expecting with hot being in the name of the dish. I really liked the tomato sauce however. It was sweeter, but a great addition to the dish.   For my main I got the Peacn-Crusted Grouper which was highly recommended by both our waiters. I made a good choice! The dish was sweet, but not overpowering. The grouper was fully crusted on the top, but the pecans were still soft. The vanilla maple butter poured over everything was a delicious component of the dish. The side that came with it of sweet potato and bacon hash was really good as well. You can order this as a side with any meal as well.   My friend got the Chicken Parmesan. Do note that even though listed by two other pastas on the menu, this dish itself does NOT come with pasta. If you want pasta with this dish you would have to order a side of it. The waiter messed this one up I think by not upselling and asking if pasta was wanted with the dish or if the side of Orecchiette was wanted.   The portion on this entree is crazy too. It comes with 4 massive chicken breasts. The plate was mounded as if there was pasta under the chicken, but there was not - the chicken was just that large. It would make more sense cost wise for the restaurant to give two pieces of chicken with pasta instead of four pieces of chicken - a bit unreasonable. It worked out though that I got to try and entire piece since my friend could only eat three. The chicken was good - thick pieces of white meat. Tender. Thin breading. And a good tomato sauce with a provolone and mozzarella cheese blend.   The dessert menu looked kind of boring to me, with only four options (chocolate moose, fudge sundae and something else) but I was blown away by the Butter Cake. It was warm - just baked with a slightly crunchy top - which was a nice surprise. The fruit and ice cream provided went perfectly together and the portion was pretty big and certainly large enough for 2 if not 3 people to share.   I tend to forget about this shopping center restaurant, but I will certainly have to stop back in again soon. I would order everything that I ate again next time. Because of the menu design, you can always find something to eat here. Even something healthy as many fish options are simply prepared."}

{"text":"Celebrated my birthday with a group of friends during a Tuesday Happy Hour, 4:30-6:30. Was not busy, so we got lots of attention. Small menu--good slider with fries, tuna tostado which is three tortilla chips with a scoop of guacamole and tuna (would like to have had one more), a large portion of very tasty Brussels sprouts, and one or two other choices. One lady got a side salad which was good. Wines were $6. Beer and cocktails. A pleasant surprise was a complimentary flourless chocolate cake of which everyone took a bite. Excellent. Good atmosphere. I've been here for dinner several times, and everything was wonderful."}
{"text":"Very sweet waitress. Good thing because, not sure what happened in the kitchen, but it took almost 2 hrs for our dinners to come out... They were very apologetic...everyone who worked there came over... and they did comp us desert.   Lobster/crab cakes were great. My filet was so-so. Overall quality of the food is good.   Would give them another try.   They need to fix the flooring....very very slippery, so be careful, especially w older people."}
