{"text":"Horrible food. Just had the red curry, basil chicken and pad thai. Red curry and pad thai were terrible couldnt even eat them. The only edible thin was the basil chicken. The flavours were odd and the food was almost tasteless at the same time. Also the dishes had less meat and more veggies than most thai restaurants. Do not waste your money eating here, you will end up hungry and have to go elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend looking to try a new Thai restaurant. Don't come here! Ordered the tom yum soup and it was so salty we had to ask for 2 cups of hot water to dilute it. The free shrimp chips are stale. The \"fried\" calamari tasted frozen with a non crispy thin batter. Do not get me started with the pad Thai.. Why was it sweet???"}
{"text":"Went there once, didn't like it at all... 

I got there menu in the mail box and decided to give it a try. I ordered a red curry with toufu and fried noodle. Both were extremely salty, even tasted a bit bitter.

Anyways, there're lots of good thai food in Scarborough, go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I came by today for lunch with my coworkers. It's a great lunch option for $10 per person.

I tried the green curry chicken. It has a nice kick and it's on the sweeter side.

I also ordered the basil beef, it's tasty. I love the basil.

The Siam noodles was not what I was expecting but still delicious with the peanut sauce. 

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Awesome! That's what I think of this place. Great value, great tasting food, awesome service, make this a definite place to eat at! My wife and I ordered 5 dishes (an appetizer, a soup, pad thai, chili chicken, and Basil beef ).  Portion sizes were very generous and our waitress was always conveniently around. pad Thai is well balanced  with sweetness savory and tartness, very satisfying, Basil beef is so tender and full of flavor  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Hot Thai House as it has taken over my previous favorite local Hakka spot. The chicken green curry here was great albeit milder than I expected. It had a slight sweetness from the coconut milk which I hadn't tasted in other variations of this dish. The lunch special I had came with a small salad, tofu/corn soup, and a portion of rice. For $8.99 the value was within expectations. I will definitely be trying some of their other options when I return."}
