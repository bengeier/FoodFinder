{"text":"I love this place. Always fresh food and a great place to just have a nice breakfast or brunch either alone on the patio..or at the bar with as few friends. My absolute favorite is the french toast with strawberries...yummy"}
{"text":"Went to ncounter for breakfast and thought it was top-notch.  Great selection of breakfast favorites like pancakes, eggs, omelettes, muffins, etc., but also some things that are harder to find.  For instance, my wife had the croque monsieur and loved it.

The location is right next to the light rail stop and the inside has been redone completely.  It looks nothing like the coffee shop that last inhabited the space (and that is definitely a good thing).  

Flavored iced teas are good, as is the orange juice.  I'm really looking forward to going back for lunch, as the sandwiches sound like they'll be as great as the breakfast was.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast is awesome. It brought me back to life on several occasions.  A lot of the food on their menu is really tasty and different which is cool because theres not a lot of places around like that."}
{"text":"Wow, my roomate took me here when I first moved to Arizona several months ago. I was impressed! The food was awesome, the decor really cute, and they have a cute bar that serves alcoholic beverages. I loved my eggs benedict and would love to return here again sometime soon!

Cheers"}
{"text":"The one word I would choose to describe my breakfast was FRESH!  This restaurant was one we had heard about and decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Killer, which consisted of bacon, Gorgonzola, tomato and eggs, sandwich style.   It came with a delicious small mixed salad on the side.   Soooo good!   The Croque Monsieur  consisted of grilled artisan sour dough, tomato, black forest ham, mustard sauce, Gruyere, 2 eggs.  Another outlandishly flavorful breakfast dish!  

I have two suggestions: 1) move the drink bar - it becomes crowded and loses its flow.; 2)  Install shades - all the customers facing towards the windows were experiencing the same issue - sun in their eyes.  Other than that, expect tasty food and great service!"}
{"text":"Most delicious and very quick even with a big Sunday brunch crowd!   My eggs were up by the time I got my coffee and a table!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and atmosphere. I wish they would put as much effort into their food as they did the concept. I expect a little more out of their food, especially their breakfast. It was a bland assortment of items that are done at home or even as well, and cheaper at Denny's.  Too many other good choices in this area to waste on a so-so, over priced spot."}
{"text":"I've only been to Ncounter once, but I had a pleasant experience and will definitely go back.

My first impression was that I loved how airy and cute and modern the decor is. And it has plenty of seating, which is always good. 

I ordered the Farmer's Market eggs, which are a take on Eggs Benedict, and freshly squeezed OJ. The only hiccup with service was that I didn't realize that they don't bring the OJ out to you w/ the rest of the food and they didn't explain that you actually grab it from a little fridge cart near the counter - but that wasn't a huge deal.

The food came out fairly quickly and my dish was super yummy. Eggs perfectly cooked, a nice hollandaise sauce, decent potatoes... and I love anything w/ spinach and avocado. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I was \"this close\" to licking my plate clean. 

My co-worker ordered one of their sandwiches and said it was good, and specifically commented how good the bacon was. 

I can't wait to go back and try some of their pastries and coffee."}
{"text":"Great surprise. Friendly, attentive and food a great value."}
{"text":"I went here on recommendation from a friend.  I saw the reviews it had already picked up and figured it couldn't be too bad.  Well, its not too good either.  My first issue is that they don't offer Egg Beaters as a substitute.  Not a big deal, but I had assumed a trendy place and trendy spot might.  Next, the potatoes that were served to me were absolutely from the day before.  We have all had leftover potatoes and know the difference.  Finally, the restrooms and the soap \"squeeze\" bottle were incredibly filthy.  

Unless you simply can not make scrambled eggs on your own, avoid the hype of this place."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast at Ncounter with my son and his girlfriend. The place was busy. Ordered the pecan and apple pancakes. They were very good.  Just finished up and a server came over asked if we were done. Collected our plates, separated our table as we SAT there and told us he had a table of 6 he needed to seat.  We were literally rushed out of the Restaraunt.  Never has this happened to us. So while I would give the place 4-5 stars the rudeness of the staff left much to be desired.  I get it, it's a hot spot, but I won't go there again."}
{"text":"So excited for a downtown location. We frequented the Mills Ave. location when we lived in Tempe and loved it, and now that we've moved to central PHX this is perfect. I had the Croque Monsieur Benedict.  Ham, tomato, gruyere cheese on a thick toasted slice of sourdough bread, topped with two eggs over medium and hollandaise sauce. DELICIOUS!  Just the right portion too.  Indoor and outdoor patio seating with spray misters to cool off the patio during the hot temps. Covered validated parking (1 hour). This will definitely be our new go to place for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"This is an \"order at counter and they bring it to you\" place. Very good sandwiches that are not run of the Mill. Four of us tried a different sandwich and shared. Each sandwich had it's own personality and pop of flavors. Portions are generous. Home brew tea is refreshing. Inside it's a bit loud with tall ceilings and hard surfaces. Outside seating is ample and nice.  Very clean place. I pleaded with the manager to bring Ncounter to Northern California. Nope. Said he'd expand in the southwest first, so I guess this one place I will put on my list each time I visit Tempe."}
{"text":"Very good menu and food. I got the simply perfect eggs (over medium) toast and sausage with taters with a strawberry smoothie.  Very good.  Got here just in time before it got crazy busy.  Others got the farmers market sandwich and enjoyed that.  Renee got the bona sandwich and loved that. The only downside, but was promptly fixed, Kevin got the simply perfect as well. He had a hair on his plate but they replaced his plate.  So it was fixed and was delish.  If you are in Tempe and want some good breakfast, Ncounter is a great place."}
{"text":"Love the patio, the food is yummy, the place is all around good! I have to say though, turn the AC down, sheesh! It was so cold inside today, we went out and sat in the heat. Also, a warm cinnamon roll should come out before the rest of food, not with it... like an appetizer. That way you aren't struggling to eat it before it gets cold/hard, while your meal gets cold."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday morning after spin class and it was very busy. The service was subpar as me and my friend waited next to a dirty table for a good 10 minutes with staff members walking past us and not stopping to address the dirty table. Eventually we had to go ask somebody specifically to come and clean the table. The food however was great. Definitely needs improvement on service."}
{"text":"Great service, lovely atmosphere and top class food. Try the vegetarian omelette... it's awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a quick breakfast and were blown away by the quality of the food for the affordable price!  It was fast, delicious and the atmosphere was nice.  We loved the fact that they offer a seating area outside for people who have dogs.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"So much potential but so unfulfilled. When a customer asks whether the strawberries that come with the French toast have anything on them or are just strawberries that does include sugar/ syrup. They were drowned in something. 
Why, when I'm dining in, do I need a coffee served in a takeaway cup with a plastic lid on it? I do know how to drink coffee out of a washable cup, without spilling it.
Sorry to say this was a really disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I won't go often, but if I want breakfast on Mill Ave this my first idea to go to. It's a great idea for a date here instead of meeting them at night too! (Tip)"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and used to be here weekly. Lately the food taken a hit. Most of the things we used to order and love are underwhelming. Flavorless (and thereby overpriced). Still a fun place for breakfast with drinks on the patio on a weekend morning (if you can get a table)."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Went in with a large group and loved the atmosphere and everyone gave their meal a high rating."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Ncounter but it won't be my last \"encounter\" with the place.  The food was good, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant for such a busy place.  There was plenty of seating, too.  This will be a great place for those headed to a game to stop in for a bite to eat either on the way there or on their way back because the lightrail is right across the street.  I have also tried this owner's other restaurant, T.C. Eggington's in Mesa and really like it too."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week and was happily pleased. The banana foster french toast is to die for, and I cant wait to go back and try more menu items. It is a bit pricey but for the quality of the food it's probably worth it. The staff was very friendly and it was an overall good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chorizo and Eggs as a burrito. Food was fresh and tasted good. Portion was large but not shockingly so. Order taker seemed a bit pre-occupied, no smile. Prices seemed a bit high. $8.00 for a burrito. 

Still though, the food was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Good food and service when empty but on a crowded Saturday morning...the system breaks down. We waited in line for awhile and when it came to be our turn, we watched as the girl at the register talked babble with her colleagues, the other kid at the register took phone orders, another staff member stood there aimlessly, and another one texted. It was unacceptable to have NO staff members at a register to receive orders from the throngs of people in line in the actual establishment. Then after our order of two items (smoothie and muffin) was finally taken, one was never delivered."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price! Everything was presented well, and all of the food was fresh. They seem quite popular! The service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"The wood picture of the pigs is so crooked it drives me insane. But I'm also obsessed with ncounter. But plz fix."}
{"text":"R.This restaurant has the best bananas foster French toast.  It's a must for us after a hike of the butts across the street in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have been here about 5 times within about a month, and every time I have been impressed with my meal. The first time I came was for lunch, and I had the Natie Bomb. The combination of turkey and bacon, balanced out by tart-ish apple was amazing. 
On my next visit I came for breakfast, which is by far my favorite meal to eat. This time I got the Santa Fe Sautee, and my wife got the Banana's Foster French. Both meals were absolutely amazing. The coffee is great as well. 

Overall NCounter is a great place to stop by for breakfast or lunch. With delicious food and surprisingly reasonable prices, it adds a great option to the sparse Tempe breakfast scene."}
{"text":"NCounter has a lot going for it--great location, cool design/signage, nice layout and good service.  Its unfortunate that the follow through of food quality did not live up.  On a recent visit to NCounter, I ordered a simple breakfast of eggs and a side of fresh fruit.  What I got concerned me to the point of asking one of their employees--fruit tasted acrid, of preservatives and like no fruit I want to taste again.  I learned from a manager/owner that contrary to their constant use of the word \"fresh\" on their website and branding, their \"fresh fruit\" comes out of a can. I understand that this is the unfortunate reality in many restaurants...those, however, are restaurants that do not (and will not) receive my patronage.  NCounter can do better. Until then, I won't be returning. I have no respect for a branding message that is not upheld in their product."}
{"text":"I'm staying in Tempe for the first time, visiting from Chicago and I love this spot for breakfast. I had the veggie omelette and it was delicious. They had plenty of healthful choices along with other breakfast specials to splurge on. I went back the next day and split the French toast with my mom and it was amazing. They use fresh challah bread with cinnamon and it's thick cut. Opted for the strawberries on the side. Fresh berries! The coffee's good too."}
{"text":"Just had a portobelloni sandwich aka mushroom sandwich with blueberry blast smoothy . The sandwich was amazing (since I am a mushroom fan) and the smoothy was good but a little stingy (I expected a smother flavor since it had yogurt in it. My combination of the two wasn't a great one. Nevertheless, individually each item was amazing.

The restaurant location and capacity are above average . The patio seatings are good.My order took 10 minutes to be ready. They would certainly use improvement on the calling for order method. Staff was both helpful and friendly. Overall great place for breakfast and I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Ncounter! We eat here regularly when we're out taking our walk. Normally we order the spiced oatmeal...best EVER! But I do love their Killer egg sandwich with gorgonzola. It's always cooked perfectly! I also love their Focaccia Roma Chicken sandwich. Oh, and don't forget the pecan cinnamon roll, it is nothing short of amazing. Even my stepson, who lives in SF (the home of fantastic food) comes here every time he's home visiting, just for the oatmeal and cinnamon roll.

Aside from the food, the best thing about this place is the manager, Daniel! He always smiles and says hello when we walk in, stops by our table to check on us (if he has time). Most of the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful if you need something else, e.g. extra milk, condiments, etc. There's a reason they are always busy...because of the great food and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this lil spot...  Great salads and sandwiches and recently met a friend for breakfast and it was delicious.  The French toast was amazing and omelets are tasty.  They have great coffees, even espresso, and   Fresh squeezed juice.  Their bakery items are great for a treat later as well.

I usually bring friends from out of town here and then walk around mill ave afterwards or walk near the lake.  Great location and cute patio area if it's not too hot.  

Great spot... Great food!"}
{"text":"Good choice of breakfast and 11 min from the airport. Chill atmosphere and a nice outdoor seating area. The food is fresh and toast is pretty good with the wide selection of omelets with fruit or potatoes."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere and really good tasting food. Portions were large but not overwhelming so. Banana walnut pancakes were fragrant, tasty, light, and just the right balance between salty and sweet. Eggs Benedict was also very very good.  Definitely a place to frequent often as long as you don't mind a line, counter ordering, and finding a place to sit without a hostess."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and for good reasons! The food is delicious, fresh, and the amount you pay is reasonable, considering you get a big amount of food on your plate and delicious flavors. The omelets are always great and after trying several breakfast items from the menu, I have never found anything wrong with my food. It is delicious! The only negative comment I would have is that sometimes when the place is extremely packed, my food gets cold due to the amount of time it takes for it to reach my table."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is my absolute FAVORITE spot on Mill. I come here with friends after a night of overindulgence, or my boyfriend for a nice brunch. Their patio is wonderful. I have never had a bad meal here. I really like their chop salad - I usually don't order salads from restaurants but this one blew me away. It was the perfect mix of textures and flavors - sweet cranberries, tangy feta, and that amazing basil pesto dressing. The pear omelette is another one of my go-to breakfasts. I had no idea that pears could taste good on top of eggs but they totally do! My favorite thing about their omelettes is that they are SMOTHERED in cheese. 

If you're hungover, they have amazing fruit smoothies... or if you want hair of the dog, their bloody mary's and bellinis are pretty good. This place is always insanely busy but my service has always been quick, at least for me. Beautiful spot for families, friends, and couples."}
{"text":"Stopped in here this past week to grab breakfast. Had a delicious chai latte and decided to get lunch instead. Had a great sandwich with cream cheese and jalapeños! Get vibe and atmosphere to! Super modern."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!  I always get the Crack O' Dawn, it is fantastic!  Also, the drinks and the cinnamon rolls are delicious.  The perfect place for brunch!  And fast service."}
{"text":"After my 5k on Saturday 2/13, I went into Ncounter with a friend to enjoy a post-run meal. We snagged a table by the door and after about 10 minutes of eating I watched a homeless man, that was struggling to even walk, slowly make his way to exit the door from using the restroom. Just by looking at him, I could tell he hadn't eaten a good meal in awhile, and sadness just emanated from his eyes. I physically could not sit there and not offer him some of my food, which I would have been throwing out anyways.

I invited him to our table to enjoy some of our leftovers.The manager came by immediately and hovered over our table, while very clearly disrespecting the guest which I had invited to our table. Even going out of his way to criticize the man for apparently \"begging for our food.\" I made a point to ensure him that this was not the case. I then asked him, politely, to retrieve a to-go box and some disposable silverware. He found the smallest box possible, neglected to provide silverware, and basically threw it onto the table without saying a word. The manager of this establishment embarrassed me in front of our guest and I was not going to let that fly. After providing the man with food and finally obtaining silverware, the homeless man went on his way and thanked us profusely.

I then went to the back, near the kitchen, and decided to have a word with the manager in front of his employees. Once again, the manager was disrespectful to me, after I had just spent $30 that morning in his restaurant. He lied to my face - telling me that he is always coming in and begging, which I found hard to believe as he was frightened to even talk to us when I physically had to stop him. I told him that because he had embarrassed me in front of my guest and the entire restaurant, I would now be embarrassing him in front of all of his employees for his atrocious arrogance. I will no longer be stepping foot into this establishment, ever again. The manager is a pity excuse for what it means to run a business, and I feel bad for the employees that have to work under him. It is basic human decency to treat everyone with respect, and I hope this taught him a lesson on humility.

Snooze is a much better alternative, with fantastic staff, and is only about 3 minutes away!"}
{"text":"If you are in the Tempe area and are looking for a killer breakfast with great service and delicious food, you better go to Ncounter. Walking into Ncounter you may be thrown off by how they operate. Most people may think this system is unappealing, but I am here to tell you why every restaurant should adopt this process. First, you grab a menu to read while you wait in line to order your food and drinks (yes, you wait in line and pay FIRST, but bare with me). I know you may think that this goes against all great restaurant's, but here is some food for thought. Have you ever gone to a restaurant and waited for your server to notice your done eating, ask if your done eating, take way too long to bring the check, and then again take too long to process the check since they are obviously helping with other tables? Well, if you hate that inefficient process as much as I do, then you will love this process. The line moves very quickly and you pay FIRST so that when your done eating, you simply leave whenever you feel like it. GENIOUS. The one carveout I have with Ncounter is that it can be difficult to find a table since it is a very popular place, especially on the weekends. If you are in a group, have one person be scoping out a table to hold for the group. The atmosphere is clean, simple, and somewhat modern. With indoor and outdoor seating, you can bring your pup! They also have a bar area inside and outside so if you are there for a quick bite and don't want to wait in line that is another great option! Not only is the atmosphere amazing, but the restaurant is on Mill Ave. Mill Ave is filled with shopping, dining, events, music, you name it. So after you are done eating, you can walk off the food coma and even take a short hike up A mountain to view Tempe from above. 
Don't be afraid to order one of their Mimosas or Bloody Mary's, which are well balanced and well-priced between 4-5 dollars. They have a variety of options ranging from gourmet omelets to fluffy strawberry pancakes and waffles topped with wiped cream. When I go to Ncounter, I know I am leaving full. They give generous portions that are very well priced. My favorite dish is the Bono. It is a barbeque, egg, tomato, onion, monster of a sandwich that literally makes my mouth water when the server brings it to me. Not only that, you get a side of perfectly cooked potatoes to go with it, just to make sure you leave full. The food comes out very quickly, usually under 10 minutes (I went for lunch during a work break one day and even got back to work early). The servers are always friendly, however, you don't need much contact with them since you pay first, leaving you to enjoy your company, your food, and not breaking your wallet."}
{"text":"I come to Ncounter a lot, I'm such a fan of this cute urban place on mill ace. After yet another amazing meal, I decided to tell and share with others this fantastic Tempe Find. My personal favorite thing is the chipotle egg burrito. It is delicious and nutritious. But don't think you have to try the burrito, they have a range of others including waffles, pancakes & french toast all loaded with fresh fruit and other fun toppings, they also have non breakfast as well like tasty salads, sandwiches, soups and a huge selection of hand crafted beverages. Not is even the best part, they have dog friendly patio :) so if you haven't been here you need to make it your next stop!"}
{"text":"First time here and had lunch with my parents. Dad ordered their tuna melt and asked for it without apples, avocado and nuts and he still received it that way and 3 mintes after we received our lunch. Mom had egg salad and their was only a half dollar size amount. I had the portabello 1/2 sandwich. It was ok. We ordered iced green tea and waited 15 minutes to have someone bring us hot tea and then another 5 for the right teas. We waited almost 25 minutes for 3 sandwiches. Food taste fine but service was bad. I mentioned it to a supervisor and he said well their bringing it now. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything I've ever gotten here. The food tastes fresh and like they use very high quality ingredients. Tends to get very a busy and rightfully so. Probably the best food on Mill Ave!"}
{"text":"Searching for breakfast in the area & stumbled on this place! Delicious! Everything was cooked perfectly & tasted great. Yummy tea & coffee also. We will be back."}
{"text":"We ate here twice on a visit to Tempe, both times for lunch and both times ordered the cold turkey and avocado sandwich.  The bread is amazing.  The sandwich is stacked!  Ingredients were fresh.  Service was good & great - at the register a little less than enthusiastic, but we ate at the bar and both servers there were friendly and helpful.  A great switch from our typical pub lunches - we look forward to going back during our next visit to Tempe!"}
{"text":"The chocolate chip pancakes were delicious! 
I've had the \"farmers market\" with eggs cooked over hard, avocado, tomato, spinach, hollandaise & potatoes etc., before and it is excellent too. A 1/2 and 1/2 combination of these two meals would be perfect!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was at a great, easy to find location. Parking is next door in the parking garage. Everything looked great. I ordered the french toast with strawberries and my husband got the pancakes and omelette. The ladies seemed to be confused with what plate was ours. Not sure if they had the kitchen organized because they kept bringing us the wrong plate.

When we finally ate, my french toast was under cooked and soggy. You can't taste the cinnamon swirl that's in it and it didn't have any sweetness. The omelette my husband got barely had any chicken or mushroom and it was loaded with cream. Pancakes were dry.

We would have said something but no one came around to see how we were doing."}
{"text":"Got some coffee on a very busy day. Line out the door. I was looking for some honey to put in my joe and they didn't have any out front in the lobby. Roland (employee) asked what I was looking for and said they had some in the back but I said I was ok. Without me knowing he went in the back, got a to-go container of coffee and tracked me down on the street to give it to me. Will definitely give them my business next time in town. Roland is the man!"}
{"text":"I love the basted eggs. Perfectly cooked every time. Great place to grab brunch and a drink before heading to an ASU game. It's a bit crowded on the weekends but the line moves quick and so does the food."}
{"text":"I had a friend in town this week, and we went a little overboard on the brats and schnitzels at a German restaurant the previous evening. Hoping for something healthy and light I decided to try NCounter. It was just what we were looking for. Good simple sandwiches (I had a tuna melt, she had a portabella sandwich) with a nice fresh side salad. The bloody mary was spot on, and the Americano was pretty solid as well. Other customers were tearing into some good looking French toast and eggs Benedict, so now I'm super psyched to come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I wasn't particularly impressed with Ncounter. I had the Killer breakfast sandwich and my husband got the Eggs Benedict. Both were just alright, and not really that tasty. The tomatoes in my sandwich were sliced very thick, which would have been fine if they had any flavor. The ham in the Benedict tasted kind of weird to me, and the hollandaise sauce was extremely bland. The potatoes that came with it though were very tasty though. I also got a peach Bellini, which was not that great. I don't think they used high quality peach nectar. I did like that it came with a gummy peach ring as garnish though. There was also a mix up with food, and long after everyone else in our party had their food, mine was still no where to be found. Eventually I got up and found a manager, and my food came out shortly after. Overall, there are many better places to have brunch and I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"My advice is go for specialty items or make it at home  and this is why. Unfortunately, I can't give many stars for my experience today at this restaurant. I ordered the plain and simple. I just wanted basic breakfast. I was very disappointed. The bacon was cold and chewy. The Bagel was hard and cold. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and requested another bagel it was obviously black and still they served it. The poached eggs were perfect. The fresh squeezed orange juice was sitting in a cooler you have to stir it and it was okay just wonder how long it was there. The coffee was okay from the Roasterie down the street so it was stated. Yelp followers  gave so many stars I had to try this but unfortunately my experience wasn't great.  It seems like the specialty items if you're going to try this restaurant are the ones to try.  Well service is lackluster. The servers act like you're an inconvenience. The initial cashier who was training someone never made any suggestions when I told them this was my first experience there and just kind of stood there waiting for me to figure out the menu as opposed to just good customer service and selling it was as if they were just in a cryo freeze until I saw them out with verbiage. I offered to pay for my juice coffee and eggs yet the manager said no it's on us and we hope you come back and try it again. If they place the same type of emphasis on customer service with the wait staff as they do the manager it might have been a positive experience."}
{"text":"I always passed this place and thought, Man! It seems like it's only a sit-down breakfast restaurant. Whoa, completely wrong.

NCounter is just a solid sandwich and salad cafe (correction: it does actually serve breakfast food like omelets and all that jazz) that brings your food to your table. The flavors are great and not too overdone. When I went I had a sandwich (forgot the name) and I was extremely impressed by how tasty it was. And the price? Honestly, I've paid about the same amount of money--if not more--on crappier restaurants down the street, but none of those dishes could ever compare to NCounter's sandwiches/salads! 

If I had time to go back here, I would. Seems like this place is always busy, though, and with a limited amount of time for lunch, I can only enjoy this place once in a while. So sad!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It's located super close to the university so lots of college students come here. It's generally super crowded but the lines go through fairly quickly and the food comes out quickly as well.
I'm vegetarian so I always grab the Farmer's Benedict with no meat and I absolutely love it. One of my favorite breakfast places in Arizona, especially Tempe. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love Ncounter! They have breakfast to die for and I love their coffee brew. They have a large menu so there is a lot to pick from and we don't get tired of it. I also appreciate that their atmosphere is more casual, because we like to stop by after morning hikes or bike rides. They are usually VERY busy which would be my only complaint. We have come here in the morning on weekdays and weekends at varying times and we can never seem to find a \"slow\" time for NCounter. So if it is busy, it is tricky to find seating."}
{"text":"This a a new trendy place in the mill ave district. Breakfast here is delicious, although the portions are on the smaller side so if you're starving it might not be the best choice. 

Tip: best bloody Mary I've ever had."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for our food for over 90 mins! The table next to us turned 2 times. While the food looks good, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you are ok wasting half a day to get a waffle."}
{"text":"I went for brunch for two times, and really enjoyed their food and seating.  Omelets are so good. If the weather is not so hot, you can just sit outside chilling with your friends by the street side. Now whenever i feel like a brunch, Ncounter just pops up in my head. Love it!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time, and enjoyed the pre-busy hours (7am) and enjoyed their shady patio. I had the farmer's market bene. It was beautiful, and I really appreciated the big helping of vegetables. The hollandaise was great. The bad: the muffin wasn't toasted, which left the entire dish soggy. Also, the eggs were way under-poached, so the whites were really runny and hard to eat. Overall, very mushy dish. Good enough to go back, though."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus I love this place. I understand it gets really packed and the servers and bartenders have a lot on their plate, but they're always on top of it and friendly. I've been here many times, and was convinced by my two favors bartenders, Peter and Tim, (Colton's pretty cool too) to write a review. Ncounter has the best omelette and their potatoes are ridiculously tasty. I've brought both my parents here and they loved it. They make great drinks and great food. I see some of these reviews that have negative feedback and I feel that it had just been a bad day for the restaurant. But honestly who doesn't have bad days?! I love Ncounter and it will forever be my favorite place. Ever."}
{"text":"I love this place. Quality of food is excellent, staff is friendly and attractive, price to value is spot on. The set up to order is crowded, but it's quick even when line is \"long\". Really just a great fast-casual concept for breakfast or lunch, and they kill it just right every time I've been there. Well done!"}
{"text":"While there are tons of great choices on their menu, my fave will always remain the Natie Bomb Sandwich (smoked bacon, turkey, apple, caramelized onions, sundried tomato mayo, cheddar cheese, on grilled 12 grain bread). Heads up, they're only open from 7:00 AM - 3:05 PM."}
{"text":"The ambiance was refreshing.  Mimosas were perfect and very tasty.  The food was so good and tasty.  Loved having a mimosa with my brunch after a small hike! I'm visiting from out of town and would definitely want to come back again!"}
{"text":"First time to eat at this place and it was very good! The french toast and waffle were delicious especially the honey butter that comes with it! Don't forget the sausages as well!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food and overall a nice place. Granola was really good with decent but not amazing fruit. The French toast was very sweet but good. The OJ was fresh and good. Great outdoor seating and parking was easy. Worth going..."}
{"text":"It's the best thing on Mill Ave in terms of food.

Made a date with some girlfriends to have brunch here on a rainy Saturday. I knew that was a stretch because of NCounter's popularity that we'd get a table at the brunch hour on a Saturday. But luckily, we got a table and we actually sat outside under a space heater and it was just fine. The inside is so modern. We went in December and their Christmas decorations were super cute. We stood in a line that wasn't too long but long enough that I had time to drool over the baked goods window. Mini cupcakes? Damn cutest things I'v ever seen. I ordered the Saturday special which was a plate of biscuits and gravy (I'm a simply gal) and my girlfriends order the much-raved about eggs benedict and an omlette. Let me tell you, for not being a fancy sit down brunch place, that was the best looking omletter I have ever seen. 

The bs and gs were great and I got a chocolate milk which totaled to $12.50. Meh, a little overpriced. I have to give NCounter props though, they sell their own merechandise and the branding they have going on is very cool and hip. Plus they have seating everywhere. I'm certain had it been a nice day out the place would have been packed to the rafters.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Total disappointment! We came in hoping for a great breakfast in Phoenix and got a total disaster. We ordered our breakfast took the number just to find out that nobody took the number in the kitchen, 15 min later we were asking about our order and nobody new about it!! We were asked to show our receipt!!! a few minutes later our order was found packed in boxes to go and the waiter was trying to convince us to eat our breakfast in boxes in the restaurant. 
It's my first negative review in Yelp but I guess this is a part of the reason the app exist.
Customer service should be first, unfortunately we did not get a good service. 
We hope ncounter improve in that aspect."}
{"text":"Right at the top of the bustling college scene on Mill Ave. is this trendy Breakfast and Sandwich shop. I work down the street and had to check it out after inquiring about good eats in the neighborhood, the traffic it gets on a regular lunch hour is something to gawk at but the vibe is fitting for me and others who are familiar with the Northwest and the \"Portlandia\" mentality.

I had the Natie Bomb Sandwich, because on the website in the gallery section it caught my eye. What is there not to like...  \"smoked bacon, turkey, apple, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, on grilled 12 grain\"

It was calling me... 

So, it despite the heavy amount of foot traffic, I found a place to sit outside and enjoy the sandwich with little effort, the turn over time is impressive as well. It is pressed before arrival and comes with a side of chips. If you are looking for comfort food this isn't really the place, but if your looking for creative takes on classics and a great place to just blend in and relax at a middle of the road price range. This place suits that need just fine."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this breakfast place for years and today I experienced the worst service I have received in quite some time at a restaurant. My girlfriend and I waited almost 30 minutes for a take out order. We quietly stood by the pickup counter patiently waiting and there were three associates that would periodically look over at us but didn't even bother to ask what we were waiting on. After 30 minutes go by I finally ask if our order is done and its over on the other side of the counter just waiting to be bagged up. Working in the kitchen I know it doesn't take thirty minutes to make eggs and the associates should have been courteous and asked what we had been waiting on. They bagged our food and handed it over to us with no sorry  or apologies . I am never coming back to this restaurant unfortunately and I will be sure to tell my friends. I hope that the manager reflects on this from a customer perspective."}
{"text":"Great food, good selection of breakfast. Fruit being surprisingly good options. Prices are great and Friendly staff makes this place a go to spot"}
{"text":"SHADY EMPLOYEES! The food here is good, but the customer service I experienced was awful. I went this past Sunday and left my water bottle on the counter of the bar. I immediately called when I got home and realized I had left it, and the man that answered asked me to describe it and then confirmed that it was at the restaurant. He set it aside for me and asked me for my name and told me I could come pick it up. When I got there, I went to the counter and asked for the water bottle by name and someone went back to grab it, saying she had seen it there earlier. She returned saying that it wasn't there with no explanation, and was not willing to look any further. I like this place, and i'm bummed that one of their employees stole something that they said would be set aside safe."}
{"text":"I found a fly in my screwdriver. I drank it down and then pointed out the fly and got another drink 10/10 service."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but I will not go back. The patio is awkward and loud because of the busy road it sits on. Umbrellas are not well placed so there's really not much cover for brunch. The food was boring and bland. Scrambled eggs had no salt or pepper in them. Pancakes were plain and syrup did not taste very maple-y. A little cinnamon or nutmeg would have gone a long way! The little mini cinnamon rolls were also not very good. They're brushed in cinnamon and sugar, but there isn't any mixed into the dough, so some bites have no flavor. Also, the pancakes come with syrup only for $6.50. If you want any toppings, they're $1.50 - each. Eggs on the side is another $3. Definitely not worth the price!"}
{"text":"Breakfast or lunch this is your spot. 

For breakfast I recommend getting one of their delicious healthy omelets. The hot Juan is a personal favorite. But they also make one with avocado that is equally delicious. For lunch I highly recommend one to get the chopped salad, truly delicious especially the pesto dressing. For dessert pick from any of the delicious cookies or pastries at the counter. Enjoy a mimosa from the bar to help your hang over on Sunday.

Very trendy atmosphere. Inside can get crowded but there is usually room outside, and in the cooler weather the dining experience becomes quite favorable. Perfect spot for a late Sunday morning or any lunch date. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. My boyfriend and I went here on our trip to Tempe, AZ to have brunch and it was super good and the food came out very quick. We really liked it, so we came back for another quick breakfast the day we had to leave to go back home. The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the EXTREMELY long wait we had the second time we ate. Food was still very good but it was almost triple the wait as our first time going!"}
{"text":"While I love having a fancy dish at Essence, it's nice to finally have an option for an all-American style breakfast in Tempe that isn't IHOP.

Though often crowded on the weekends, the servers really do a great job of clearing off tables quickly, and checking in to make sure all is well with your dishes. I have been there over 10 times, and have never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table to open up.

I think the only confusing aspect of the restaurant is how your food is ordered. A few times I have been waiting in line to order at the main registers, when servers at the secondary registers (next to the drink bar) have asked people behind me for their orders. It just feels weird to be standing ahead of someone in line, only to hear them get their order in before you. A couple times, it left me feeling as though NCounter wasn't well organized and a bit put off that my food wait time was increased even though I was ahead in line. That's the reason I have knocked off one star from my rating.

I just learned, though, that you can also order food online. My husband went to pickup an online order and showed up 5-6 minutes early to just be safe and the food was already packed up and waiting. I did wonder how long it had been sitting there before being picked up. Perhaps NCounter would do better if these online orders were 2 minutes late instead of 10 minutes early. Just a suggestion.

The food, though, is fantastic! My favorite items to order include:

* Eggs, Toast, and Grilled Potatoes ($5.50)--simple and tasty, make sure to ask for some extra jam!
* Classic Eggs Benedict ($8)--Delicious!
* French Toast ($5.50)
* The Pear Omelette ($8)--you can't beat this brie and bacon combination."}
{"text":"Such a shame these guys don't focus on the coffee as much as they do the food. 

Been there twice now cause the location was close to the hotel but being a real coffee lover,  sooooo disappointed to discover that they can't provide the usual gibraltars, flat whites, and machiatos we expect from cafes and restaurants now.

The first time my espresso came out in a 12 inch paper cup so virtually a dribble in a cup. The second time, when the waitress had no idea what a gibraltar was, I ordered a small Americano, only to have it taste like a weak french press. No crema, no strength,  no flavor.

Such a shame for the business to have invested in a commercial espresso machine only for them not to make the most of it."}
{"text":"This place is super yummy, the ingredients are so fresh and delicious and several menu items are interesting. I also loved the following random things: nuts are combined in to many dishes, the kid's menu was reasonably priced, and everyone working was pretty friendly. We were in town for about ten days and I easily had us visit five times. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went on a late Saturday morning and found it to be a pretty big disappointment, especially after hearing this is the same people that run TC Eggingtons, which has never disappointed.  Their second week being open so I can understand the long ticket times (20 minutes for breakfast), but not the poorly cooked food.  English muffin on the Eggs Benedict was not even toasted, the potatoes were undercooked and lacked any seasoning.  They looked like they came out of a bag.  The bananas on the Banana Foster French Toast were uncooked and not caramelized with any brown sugar.  The French Toast itself was OK, but for $7 and no side it was pretty bad.  The bacon was cool and seemed to have been cooked off earlier and held in a steam pan like at a buffet.  The biggest nightmare was the setup.  I had no idea where to go as there are 3 entrances, none of which access the counter where you order.  You enter and walk through a maze of tables and people to order your food.  I thought I was in the right line and then realized it was people waiting for espresso.  Then when I got in the right line there were people all over the place and nobody knew who was next.  Was there no thought or planning involved in this style of service to handle busy times?  Sauce & Pei Wei seem to have it nailed, maybe they should take a lesson or two from them.  Second star because they offer breakfast cocktails, unfortunately we will not be back anytime soon to try them."}
{"text":"nice breakfast place on mill. stand in line, order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. omelette with pears, havarti, sliced almonds and bits of bacon was good and cheesy. it had a fresh fruit cup as accompaniment. weather perfect and nice to sit out side. fortunately no one was smoking."}
{"text":"Great omelette, friendly & pretty staff, good espresso, solid music.. and the worst home fries I've ever had. cut up a potato into little slices, lightly heat it up in a pan so it's a little soggy and not crispy, don't add any spices or garlic or anything... nope."}
{"text":"The wait sucks. Waited over half an hour on our food and people up to three orders behind us recieved food before us."}
{"text":"This Breakfast and Brunch place is really fresh and delicious. There is a really nice outdoor patio to enjoy Arizona's Spring weather."}
{"text":"Took my parents that were in town from Chicago to Ncounter and our omelett, french toast, and potatoes were cold and soggy. We ordered at 10:50am and received our meals at 11:20am.. 30 minutes to make a few meals? The only warm part of our meals was the syrup. Very upsetting considering nobody apologized for the delay...You'd think a restaurant would have one or the other, great food or customer service, if not both! Today Ncounter lacked both."}
{"text":"This place is very diffrent for mill! Breakfast is great tast like home not like a fast meal! worth the $$$ the evern have green juices 

but the parking SUCKS thats why we stopped going we had to pay to park then eat?  no thanks"}
{"text":"I came across Ncounter because it was one of the only open restaurants in the area I was traveling through that was open before 10 o'clock-- and I'm happy I found it! 
I ordered the Portobellini hot sandwich that was filled with artichoke, spinach, portobellini mushrooms and roasted red peppers on ciabatta bread. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor that wasn't lost due to eliminating the provolone cheese and balsamic mayo to make the item vegan. The sandwich came with chips and was easily shareable, but I was hungry and ate it all! If ever in the area I would recommend trying this restaurant, and their Bloody Mary's (great variety)."}
{"text":"Perfect fit on Mill Ave. I'm surprised it took this long to get a cool little breakfast/coffee bar on Mill, considering the amount of hangover breakfast traffic the area gets with ASU right next door. 

I've been a few times and have been rather pleased. The food has been great, and they do a nice job with their presentation which gives the experience that extra bonus. The atmosphere is engaging, artwork on the walls, some cool old architectural sketches, and some nice color highlights and tasteful touches. The coffee was fine, nothing amazing but by no means sub-par. I honestly opt for the smoothies when making my breakfast trips, I take care of the coffee at home before hand. 

Only complaint: when it gets busy things tend to fall apart. I've been there a good handful of times now and they are definitely gaining momentum. The only problem is when it gets out of hand and the line is out the door, food takes a while and sometimes comes looking rushed or even cold. Honest mistake though, it gets pretty packed in there. 

Overall: perfect breakfast spot for a late start on a Saturday. Conveniently located next to a light rail stop as well."}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop in the city.  Wonderful, creative combinations of ingredients.  Great salads.  Fantastic breakfast items served all day.  Cool, hip atmosphere.  Three days in a row now.  My new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"Thank you to Yelp again - we found this great spot so close to the hotel we could walk.  The line was out the door but moved quickly.  The cashier was nice and answered all my questions. Everyone was happy - bloody marys, specialty coffees, great breakfast items.  We will return the next time we are in Tempe."}
{"text":"I've never been to the actual building, but a girl brought half a dozen of these to my BIL when he was visiting. Some of the most BEAUTIFUL cupcakes I've ever seen; but also some of the most disgusting. Too dry and the frosting was way too sugary. If they hadn't been a gift none of us would have touched them."}
{"text":"Messed up the order, skipped a menu item, and the chicken cilantro soup was absolute trash. Honestly, it is hard to mess up a simple order or a soup. The soup had too much tomato base, and the chicken fasted funky. After they messed up the omelette, I asked them to correct it, and even though the omelette plate had bread with it, she brought \"repaired\" omelette without bread. Seriously?!! First you mess up the order, and then you don't even have decency to bring full order again. After I asked her to bring the bread, it was COLD!. Extremely disappointed. 

The only extra star, they got, was for good tasting omlette."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Tempe! (Almost tied with Chompies but Ncounter wins out for healthiness!)"}
{"text":"my favorite salad EVER happens to be served at Ncounter. It's the chopped salad...goodness gracious every bite is better than the previous. Try it!"}
{"text":"Place was busy on a Saturday morning but luckily there is tons of seating. Line moved quick and food came in a decent amount of time. Employees were friendly and cleaned plates quickly after we finished. Good prices and the only breakfast joint on mill so I was happy it wasn't disappointing. I would definitely go back. Plenty of interesting food options to try."}
{"text":"This place is new, and its amazing! On my first time, I order the dripping cheddar, roast beef sandwich... BLEW MY MIND AWAY!
Second time visiting, I ordered the Farmer's Market Bene, and I was sad once I was almost done ravishing it! 
closes at 3pm, everyday, which annoys me, because sometimes I need a late a lunch, or an early dinner while on campus  :("}
{"text":"After eating at Ncounter for lunch and Breakfast, I think they have a winner. Staff is helpfull, eggs were cooked perfectly, and the decor is great. We love to support a new local business that is not a chain! Good work! We will be back."}
{"text":"The Mediterranean omelette is my personal favorite menu item. This place is delicious; however they close inconveniently early and it's always crowded."}
{"text":"Delicious!  You've got to try the cinnamon French toast - you can add it a-la-carte. 

Everything is great!"}
{"text":"My first review for Ncounter was regarding a lunch dish, and I was not impressed.  

I have since been back several times for breakfast and had much better experiences.  Their breakfast dishes are on point!  The Chipotle Egg Burrito and Classic Eggs Benedict are my favs.  The grilled potatoes they serve with most breakfast dishes are perfect.  Every time."}
{"text":"This looked cool so we tried it.  
Waitstaff were not very friendly. 
Tuna melt was AWFUL,  very gooey with no noticeable tuna.  
Iced tea tasted like dirt."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Tempe visiting Tempe. We stopped in for breakfast. My wife ordered a veggie style omelet that came with hash browns. She liked the omelet but the potatoes were very blah. They were not crispy and were under seasoned. My dish was a ham, egg and cheese open faced dish. It was very tasty. Overall it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Another overpriced fake establishment going for trendiness over quality. My muffin had no flavor other than the undercooked bits of apple that still had the peel on. The coffee was ruined by the non-dairy creamer that was NOT labeled as non-dairy. For a place to have only two pitchers, one of which is 2% milk and the other non-dairy creamer not labeled as such, is unforgiveable. I ordered regular coffee; I knew upon seeing their super-auto poseur espresso machine to avoid any espresso drinks. I also haven't tried their cooked food, but judging by the prices, I don't think I will.  $8 or more for a sandwich is more expensive than Romancing the Bean and most items at Essence Bakery, and it's unlikely to be as good as either. If you want a muffin, walk across the street to Romancing the Bean (located at the base of the KPMG building), if you want good coffee or a croissant, get one of the best ones in the state at Essence (Hardy & University), and if you want an awesome breakfast or lunch, try either. For espresso you'll have to go Cartel Coffee. It's the only good place within a mile of Mill Ave. Whatever you do, don't waste your time or money on NCounter."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted. I've been here before and enjoyed it, but took a friend there this morning and was pretty disappointed. Gave the friend the big build-up so was a bit embarrassed by the poor showing. 

We ordered 2 Plain and Simples and they showed up pretty quickly. So far so good. However, the food was not hot, the bacon was undercooked and the potatoes were way overcooked. Not sure how the potatoes were overcooked, and still served at room temperature - but that's how it was. To cap off my experience, I found a long hair on my plate. I'm not squeamish, but I gotta say, \"yuk.\"

Restaurant 101: Someone needs to scrutinize every plate before it leaves the kitchen. Is the food hot? Is there a big friggin' hair in it? 

We were the first customers on a Sunday morning, the cooks were probably hung-over college kids. 

Oh, and while I'm at it - the coffee was weak and nearly devoid of flavor.

I'll be downtown in a few weeks, so will try it again and revisit / revise this review in the interest of fairness.

UPDATE: Went back a few weeks later, and it seemed to be back to it's usual quality. Would probably go again."}
{"text":"First time visiting food is amazing fresh many choices (healthy) - delicious. great service, a must try"}
{"text":"Cute little place with wonderful service from the moment we walked in on a Sunday.  Interesting & tasty cocktails to start.  Speedy service and chill atmosphere.  Would recommend as a quick treat!"}
{"text":"I worked here, and the food is amazing. Everything on the menu is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Best and busiest brunch spot on Mill! Just be warned if you go on the weekends, it's a mad house. But overall they serve great food plus they are close to A mountain so you can burn off your meal after!"}
{"text":"Seems like a typical breakfast place just with more hipness and cool sheep artwork. I got the pear omelette which was a nice sweet and savory taste and my husband got the chipotle burrito. They came with a side of not so fresh potatoes but they had nice flavor. The bathrooms are cool and so was the music. Overall, it was slightly unique breakfast food but didn't go the extra mile to make it healthy or less sugar less saturated fatty breakfast."}
{"text":"We rode our bikes down to NCounter on Saturday for lunch. I now have a new favorite breakfast/lunch spot! The menu was great ( breakfast, salads, sandwiches) and the ambiance was fun.  I had a delicious sandwich and my wife had an omelet. Both were very tasty and well prepared.  Next time I plan to try some of the delicious pastries at the counter. Cinnamon Pecan roll looks great. Definitely headed back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have not had one bad dish here.  This is finally a place on Mill Ave that will make it.  I highly recommend the Portobellini sandwich and the Banana Fosters French Toast.  They also serve Bellinis and Mimosas!"}
{"text":"The reviews are pretty accurate. There's great food and it's made very well. The only downside to this place is the wait time. If you go for brunch on the weekend expect to be waiting on your food for a while. It's worth it most times."}
{"text":"Ate brunch around 11am, almost no wait in line. Food came prompt, we ordered coffee,the iced quad latte is pretty tasty by the way. Had the loaded omelet with tomatoes as the side, and it was easily the best omelet I've had in years. Girlfriend had the Chipotle burrito, minus the spicy sauce which they easily accomodated. TL;DR Short wait outside normal busy times, great food. Come here!"}
{"text":"Great menu...lots of choices and excellent quality and tasty food. Long line went pretty quick but need to redesign the ordering area to accommodate that many people. We all enjoyed are meals and good vibe...will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm get my breakfast to-go here about 2 times a week. The omelettes are fantastic, and they fill you up for hours.
I'd recommend this place for sure, just beware, the lines are long for a reason so plan a head."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good variety, friendly staff, outdoor seating. Chipotle burrito was great."}
{"text":"I ate here once and it was great. The second time was for my Birthday and the food was extremely unsatisfactory. I ordered a Eggs Benedict and the eggs were literally over cooked to the point the yolk was like a hard boiled egg. The yolks should have some liquid texture to them on an eggs Benedict not be hard. Aside from that the rest of it was not cooked well either and I paid over $20 for just my meal. I reached out to the location (Tempe Mill Ave) and they not so much as reached back out to acknowledge they received my feedback. I will never return here for the simple fact that they showed no concern for the customer experience or concerns."}
{"text":"If you ever need a bathroom in a pinch. Please. Go to encounter. The experience will change your life"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch food! Accomodating staff and very organized service- we will be back!!"}
{"text":"the bananas foster was delicious!!! yummmm And if you don't want something sweet the Hot Juan Omlete and  the Loaded Omlete was absolutely delish!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place until ASU was out for the summer. It was still busy at 9:30 on Saturday but I'm sure less so than during the school year and we were even able to find free street parking nearby. Customers looked like mostly locals in a mix of ages.  After ordering at the counter it took about 15 minutes to receive our food. Service was brisk and efficient and we enjoyed watching the food orders come out.  I had \"The Killer\" breakfast sandwich (bacon, tomato, blue cheese and eggs on toasted ciabatta) with fruit on the side and my husband had chorizo and potatoes with toast instead of tortillas. Both were excellent.  I'm glad to see they're opening new locations because I'd hesitate going to this one during the school year unless it was pretty early in the day."}
{"text":"Found the place while on a bike ride. The breakfast was awesome for the price would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped her for brunch on a Mon before my drive back to Tucson. Honestly, I wasnt too impressed. I ordered the Classic Eggs Bene & a strawberry banana smoothie. The smoothie was average & the eggs bene took forever to come. When my food did finally come. it was a bit cold. The potatoes were bland and my eggs bene were average at best. The egg was poached well and the yolk was runny, but the english muffin & ham were a bit tough."}
{"text":"We have eaten several times for breakfast only.  I usually order a breakfast sand which and have been pleased.  Today I ordered the hot Juan omelette and was disappointed.   Way to much cheese which led to the omelette sitting in a lot of grease.  Way to little chorizo and way to much salsa.  The omelette was drowning in salsa.  My MIL had French toast that was cold.  My d got pancakes and enjoyed those.  They were good.  

I will also agree with the poster below that the music is a tad to loud at breakfast.  When you continually have to say what it is to loud."}
{"text":"Great food, moderately priced.  Also, conveniently located off the light rail in Tempe"}
{"text":"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!!  

I normally always order the same meal, eggs benedict & the potatoes are my favorite. Yes the restaurant is usually busy inside and outside seating, I normally try to order my food-to-go. So if you decide to come in, be there early or be ready to wait a few moments till a table clears up. I think another location is needed near Chandler, Az area-- just sayin....."}
{"text":"My group of four went to NCounter for brunch on Saturday. I had the Bono sandwich, which also comes with a side salad. It was extremely delicious. The others had French toast and omelettes, and they liked their meals very much.

The service and ambiance are great. The only downside is that it can feel a bit cramped inside."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed with the quality of food. We spent $21 for two entrées and it was really only worth about $8. The potatoes, eggs and bread were underdone"}
{"text":"The loaded omelette and Pecos grill are what my husband and I ordered. Our friend ordered eggs Benedict. She gave her order a three star, we gave ours a four. Our potatoes were warm, not hot. 

The flavor of our meals were really good, but it would have been nice to eat a hot meal. 

Overall, I would come back, despite the temperature."}
{"text":"Great place to get a top quality breakfast.. Pear omelet is awesome! Great coffee too."}
{"text":"First time here! A friend who is an ASU alumni suggested it as we were headed back to Scottsdale from the airport. Quick service, lots of options and bartender was super nice!! Had the farmers market Benedict, only downfall was it wasn't very warm (nit sure if that was intentional) and there was no ham on it... But the Bellini and mimosas were excellent! Especially with the peach ring candy garnish!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a Thursday morning. Asked where our order was after waiting 30 minutes to be told it would be another 20-40 minutes b/c they were having a burrito special and were running behind. We were not informed of this when ordering. Ended up getting a refund and leaving."}
{"text":"While the food here was good, I am just not a fan of the long line, the packed atmosphere, and the tight quarters. Just don't feel like I had any personal space, and made me feel a bit stressed out, and rushed. I would suggest coming here for breakfast, however I highly recommend to avoid the busy hours."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were AMAZING!  I got omelets both times, once with a side of waffles.  My husband got sandwiches both times (not a breakfast man).  We both have agreed that this is one of the best brunch joints around.  It's a little pricey but very worth the occasional visit!  Service was quick both times as well, even though we went during very busy Saturdays.  I think we maybe waited 10 minutes after ordering despite the place being packed."}
{"text":"Anyone who lives in Tempe knows this place is the best. I live right on mill and have rolled in here hungover many times, and their breakfast and bloody marys always suffice."}
{"text":"Their Banana Walnut Pancakes are to die for ....I can have them every single day of my life...they are that freaking delicious.They also have a variety of healthy sandwiches and fruit juices...perfect place for Breakfast / Brunch.Be prepared for a wait time though..they are pretty busy.."}
{"text":"The croquet monsieur is divine! It's also portioned very well and the sour dough is to-die for! The pricing is a bit high, but the food quality absolutely matches that.

As for the seating: it's OK! You know, it's on Mill Ave (which is so mehhh) so they work with what they were given as far as the building/setup is concerned. It's always so packed BECAUSE the food is so great! If you can find a way to fix the way the seating goes (inside and out) to make it less cramped when it's hopping, you will get a 5 star rating from me. But other than that--kudos! For bringing a nice, divey breakfast joint to a trashy, bar street for ASU and young drunkards alike!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great if you want a quick brunch with a bunch of college students. It is your typical run of the mill (pun intended) college brunch spot with loud music. I love the patio area and the quick service they offer. We got our smoothies and food really quick and were greeted by friendly staff. The blueberry smoothie is worth going back for, but the biscuits and gravy were lack luster. They need some more flavor, the gravy had no wow factor and honesty I ended up taking it off the biscuits to just eat them. The biscuits were good, however mine had some burnt spots I had to eat around. Worth checking out, but don't expect for anything out of this world. :)"}
{"text":"This place was my first stop in AZ as soon as I got in from the airport. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS. I mean, you gotta love a place that has morning cocktails. AMIRITE?"}
{"text":"Great food, service, & atmosphere! I love their Farmers Market Benedict, with avocado and breakfast potatoes, yum! They have a pet friendly patio but it is fast casual so you have to order at the counter, luckily they have a bar outside you can order food from too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful wonderful!! Finally a place in downtown Tempe where I can get breakfast. I am an early riser ( 7:30 am on weekends!) and nothing is ever open that early. NCounter answered my prayers. I ordered the eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon. So delicious! It's really easy to make the hollandaise sauce too tart. So not the case here. It was very filling and I had the potatoes on the side. My boyfriend got the Pear omelette and it was sweet and salty, the perfect combination. For a drink I ordered an iced chai tea. Perfect! I have tasted iced chais that have tasted like soap before so I was pleasantly surprised when this didn't taste like it. Did you know they also serve breakfast cocktails?? That's right for only $5 bucks you can get a mimosa, Bellini, or bloody Mary. Most places charge like $7. It's within walking distance from my house and steps away from the light rail. Whether you are a meat eater or non meat eater there is bound to be an item that will satisfy your palette."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here. It is set up in a fast food fashion but the food is way better than you will ever find at any fast food place. Lots of college kids flock into this place so you know the foods great and the prices are right."}
{"text":"I had the pear omelette today and it was outstanding. Very different for an omelette but it works with just the right combo of ingredients. The staff was welcoming too. I took a star off for the lack of hash browns - maybe one day breakfast establishments will realize that breakfast potatoes aren't exciting. It's all about the hash browns well done."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch spot. I had the tuna melt and it was great. My girlfriend had the chopped salad. Also good. The menu is extensive. The breakfast items going by looked amazing. I'm going to have to come back and try their red velvet waffles!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was good. Order at the counter and find a seat place. The set up is weird though since the counter is way in the back and hard to get to when it's busy. Hubs and I had the eggs Benedict which was good. Perfect poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Daughter had bananas foster French toast. Like a cinnamon roll on steroids. Daughters friend had the Santa fe which was good too!"}
{"text":"Love Ncounter in Tempe. Tried this new location and was disappointed in the amount of turkey in this sandwich, so thin. Not like the natie bomb I had in Tempe! I hope they make some corrections."}
{"text":"Ncounter features fresh food and an expansive menu.  The ingredients are local when available and the location and feel of the restaurant is top notch. More spicy food needed tho, even tho the hot sause collection is nice...  High three star rating. I recommend..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Tempe! The location right next to the Mill ave. light rail station makes it easily accessible to anyone coming from either the west or east valley. Make use of the light rail if you can park a couple stops away as parking is limited and almost always metered since it's downtown Tempe. There's always a good sized crowd no matter which day you go. The food options are plenty as they have something for everyone and is inexpensive as well. I often go for their omelette (Loaded is a favorite) with potatoes on the side. Their sandwiches are delicious as well. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm knocking this place down a ton. The last time I was in here our service wasn't great and I was completely disappointed with the food I ordered. My boyfriend and I stopped in one morning before catching a flight. We ordered two yogurt parfaits and a soy latte for me.

The latte was just fine, nothing special, and the girl helping me at the coffee bar was nice. The parfaits were mediocre. Ok, not good. I hate, repeat hate, when you order a yogurt parfait with \"fresh fruit\" and its packed full of melons. Yes, you know the sort. Cantaloupe, Honey Dew, and even grapes are no good in a parfait. Melons add zero flavor or texture to a parfait and frankly, its cheap. Ok, I'm being mean and I'm kind of sorry. But I'm kind of not. 

A killer parfait has rolled oats, honey, and some actual fresh berries like: Blueberries, Raspberries, Strawberries, Goji Berries, pomegranate seeds, etc... Something besides melon. I think you're picking up what I'm putting down."}
{"text":"I haven't even been served yet, in fact my boyfriend is still in line to order, but it is a very busy Sunday morning and yet an employee just brought out a big bowl of ice water for my dog as we wait on the patio. Automatically in love."}
{"text":"This place is chill. Service is dec. The food here is good but omg do girls love it here. Must remind them of being in LA. Every time I go I always get the over priced mill ave stack. Only thing I can grub on the menu after a heavy night of drinking. Their eggs are weird and obviously not cage free."}
{"text":"So Yum! Great Prices, especially for the amount of food you get! And the food is So Pretty!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Place was very busy. Good was delish. 
Service was very good. 
We loved our pear omelette and chorizo sautée!
The employees were working hard. We'll comeback for sure."}
{"text":"Plain n Simple Breakfast is the way to go.  Plenty of food and great presentation.  Enjoy the breakfast with a cup of their coffee which is very good.  Place is bustling around 9 on a Saturday am.  Grab a table in the back corner if you want some quiet."}
{"text":"Never again! Car towed after a 45 minute wait!!! The food is very good. Great menu mix...its just that you really need to devote an hour and a half of your life to enjoy it. Not very conducive in a fast paced place like ASU/ Tempe."}
{"text":"Update on my previous review:

So disappointed!! They must have changed their cooks of something because I come here all the time (at least once a week) and the past two times I've been here it's been awful... 
My farmers Benedict was missing avocado and had un-ripe green tomatoes on it!! Ew.
Next, I came for lunch today... And it was bad. The Roma chicken sandwich was SOGGY! The bread was so filled with liquid by the time it hit my plate that it fell apart in my hands, landed/splashed on my plate, and got on my shirt... Very disappointed.

What happened Ncounter? You use to be so reliable and delicious :("}
{"text":"Order anything... it's all good. Seriously.

While Mill Avenue isn't exactly full of great breakfast spots, this one is about as good as it gets. From granola wheat germ to fried skillets, eggs benedict, chipotle burro, they have a ton of selections. Yeah, that's the hardest part of going here; selecting what to get. Oh, yeah... Don't forget to start off with a smoothie. If you have kids, ask for the Mickey Mouse pancakes, they will love them.

For lunch, the salads and sandwiches are equally as good. The cheese-freak in me is a fan of the \"melt-down\" and the \"cheddar'd dip\"

Ncounter is one of the most light rail friendly locations along the line. In fact, it's directly across from the light rail station at 3rd and Mill, you can't miss it. If driving, you can park in the garage just West of Ncounter or on Mill OR in the parking lot on the East side of the road.

Oh, they have beer, booze, coffee and pastries, too. Grab a coffee or try a bloody mary or a mimosa while sitting on the patio, you can't go wrong...
The red velvet cupcake really doesn't suck. My friend Bill ordered one once and I had to have a taste. Nothing says manly like two dudes sharing a red velvet cupcake, right?"}
{"text":"My last few visits here are been sub-par.  I used to really love this place even though it's always crazy busy.  The last time two times I ordered the \"Farmer's Market\" the eggs were completely hard-boiled and it was served cold. With how busy they are, I am not sure how that happens. So I switched up to the \"House Request\" sandwich and there was about a 1/2 lb of cream cheese on it which is not very appetizing. After I scrapped most of it off it wasn't bad, but I had also obliterated the sandwich.  Maybe I have just had a run of bad luck so I'll stop by a few more times when I get time and see if it was just a run of bad luck."}
{"text":"This rating is for the one in Scottsdale after waiting and excited of its opening finally got to eat here
I would never come back
Food not great and coffee even worse.
The 1 Star is for the help which was the only good thing!!"}
{"text":"Food really good. Went for breakfast and everything really good and prepared as requested. Nice selection and friendly staff. Will go again when in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and I rave about the portobello sandwich like it's my grandmas recipe. Seriously, even though I am a breakfast food aficionado, portobello sandwich or bust. I love the location and that outdoor seating is perfect under the trees. The staff is nothing but friendly, and I've always received my food in a timely manner. I've not hit the bar too many times (which is honestly so rare for me) but they just have great iced tea."}
{"text":"This place was crazy busy the Sunday before ASU started classes.  Breakfast was awesome and the portions were decent.  Loaded Omlete was my choice.  My friend had the waffles.  Both were excellent.  The oatmeal looked good too, if you are looking to be healthy.  

I will come back."}
{"text":"*****Great breakfast spot on Mill!! :) 
I had one of their hot sandwiches the FOCACCIA ROMA-CHICKEN, cut up grilled chicken breast pieces, tomato, gooey melted provolone cheese, light mayo on a cheesy Focaccia bread with added minced jalapenos and lettuce to mine!!  It was delicious!! I also ordered my favorite drink the Caramel Macchiato, but instead they mistakenly made me a caramel latte which was still as good as a Caramel Macchiato. Overall, the service was great and so was my sandwich and drink!!
    *I will surely be back!! :)"}
{"text":"GREAT food, GREAT atmosphere, decent prices, subpar service. Every time I've been here (about 5 times or so) I've loved the food, but the service is always pretty bad. Never a smile or a \"have a good one\" or even a greeting. Seems they do the minimum of taking your order and that's it.. It's a shame because this place could be amazing if they just put a little effort into customer service. It would totally earn 5 stars.

If you're simply lookin for amazing breakfast food then no doubt come here."}
{"text":"Good -- Omelettes, sandwiches, salads, pancakes -- fresh, creative, well presented.

Excellent customer service.

Bad -- Potatoes, acoustics (can't hear the person across the table)

Very bad -- Coffee, which is watery. Even the espresso drinks are weak and flavorless."}
{"text":"I love coming into N-Counter for brunch on the weekends. The food is great and there are a lot of menu options to choose from. I have only tried the poached eggs dish and the scrabbled eggs with potatoes, toast, and bacon. Both dishes are great and simple. I am excited to go back and try something a little more adventurous on the menu the next time I am in town. 

I have been to a couple other breakfast spots on Mill Ave and N-Counter is by far the best. They have a great menu to choose from, a bar with decent drinks, speedy service, and a beautiful interior. You walk in and place your order at the counter, so this is not a traditional sit down restaurant. I would suggest having someone in your dining party grab a table while someone else places the order.

Tip: I would highly recommend trying the Arizona Gunslinger hot sauce they have. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge breakfast fan.  Imagine my delight when my husband and I discovered that a new breakfast/lunch joint had opened right off Mayo Blvd. A few years back we had visited the Ncounter in Tempe, but only for a quick mimosa. On our visit to the new Scottsdale location we both opted for the saute breakfasts, which are grilled potatoes topped with sauted vegetables and two fried eggs.  My husband had the Santa Fe Saute which included chicken, pepper-spiced veggies, mushrooms, and melted cheese with flour tortilla and I had the Denver Saute which had ham, green pepper, onions, grilled potatoes, and melted cheese with a choice of toast. Both were delicious! We also ordered mimosas because what is brunch without booze - just a sad breakfast. Though not the least expensive mimosas ($8), the pour was a good size and there were four different flavor options.  

Be prepared to order at the counter when you arrive and then find an open table.  It wasn't busy because we were there on a Monday morning so I'm wondering how easy/difficult it will be to find a table on a weekend.  This location has a very nice patio which should help during the warm weather.  The decor was clean and modern, the service was prompt, all in all a great experience. We'll definitely be adding Ncounter to our list of favorite breakfast places along with Snooze, the Breakfast Club, and the Hash Kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food and great selection- must come!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast experience. Came at 8:00 on a Tuesday morning, so predictably there were plenty of seats and no wait.

You order at the counter and the staff will bring your meal to your table. Coffee, utensils, condiments, etc. are self service. 

Quick note:  Staff were all very friendly and attentive. It seemed as though the cared, and enjoyed their jobs. Well done. 

I had the Farmers Market, essentially a vegetarian eggs Benny. Quite tasty and good portions. The only negative with my meal was that one of my eggs was poached hard, the other very runny. Not sure how this happens, but no big deal. Variety is the spice of life, they say, and ncounter is no exception it seems.  A bit of Cholula hot sauce and I was good to go. 

Street parking was plentiful. 

I wouldn't hesitate to return during my next Tempe visit, and would confidently refer others."}
{"text":"We stopped by this restaurant to grab a sandwich to-go. I got the Pecos Grille which I enjoyed. The chicken was seasoned really well & tasted great with the cheese & jalapeños. The only thing that was kind of weird was that the bread was buttered & warmed but not really toasted. If I order this again, I'd ask them to grill it or something.

The service was disappointing. When I placed my order, the lady at the cash register was rude & didn't listen to my order completely. I had asked for extra chips but didn't receive them .. I didn't bother to go back to the same lady but rather asked someone else for them.

Just for the food, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"If it was not too bad, And nothing spectacular then what .... 3 stars. Counter service and then table delivery. Food was presented well but just flat. Salad on the side was nice but lettuce was lifeless. Sauce on chiliquilles was meh. Friends eggs Benedict was also meh. The cinnamon roll was pretty yummy coffee was also nice. All in all not saying I wouldn't recommend it however in this part of town need to bring your A game."}
{"text":"We thought it was a joke when my Banana Foster French Toast was covered with a film of brown slime coming out from the mouth of the possessed girl from \"Exorcist.\" After a few stirs, the revolting concoction would coagulate into an amorphous blob metastasizing and multiplying to devour its prey in a science horror film. 

Panicky and nauseous, we summoned our young waitress to attend to our distress. \"This is the banana foster sauce. It is not supposed to be syrupy and this is how it's always been made like this,\" she answered with such composure and disinterest in our seemingly futile concern. 

Curiosity dared us to ask how the sauce was made. Returned with the precarious object still on the plate, our waitress proclaimed it was cooked with butter, reduced sugar, triple sac [and cornstarch, alien DNA...].

Lightning struck us as we exited the restaurant in trepidation into the scorching 109 degree heat under the Phoenix sun: we were in Tempe, Arizona."}
{"text":"Ncounter is a great choice for a quick breakfast.

It's cheap (about $7-$8 per entree), but the food doesn't taste cheap.
Like a lot of other Yelpers, I love the Banana's Foster French Toast.
I also really like the Peanut Butter Banana Chocolate Muffin.

My wife wasn't as thrilled with her Eggs Benedict, and we thought it was a bit odd that, after we got our food, no one came by to check on us.

We like the fact that their patio is dog-friendly, and that they have water bowls for the pups.  If you're in the area, or just want a quick bite to eat for breakfast, give this place a chance.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I could eat breakfast every day here! I love breakfast foods and this place knocked it outta the park for me on multiple visits. 

Things I've tried:

*Bananas Foster French Toast: thick slices of french toast with banana caramelly goodness all over them. ((MY FAVORITE!))

*Waffles: the batter is fantastic, the strawberries were fresh and the whip cream topped it perfectly. (no syrup needed for these delicious waffles!)

*The Pear: this is an omelet with bosc pear, havarti cheese, almond slices and bacon. (You may be thinking, as I did.....pear, eggs and cheese? Don't miss out on this combo, it's outstanding!)

They do offer GF options too if you need/prefer. I have yet to try their lunch items because of all the breakfast options. I hear that the Smokehouse Avocado Stack is a must try item! No doubt, I will be back in very soon. Prices are great, happy employee's but the service is a little slow. I attribute the slow service to the fact every time I am in this restaurant it is crazy busy, so just be prepared to wait a little bit. You won't be disappointed once you have your meal though, I think it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is the TRUTH! This was my second time visiting the Phoenix area, though this time I was in Tempe at the Marriott Courtyard by Mill Avenue. I was concerned if the breakfast spots here were as good as those in Scottsdale, where I had stayed on my first visit to this area.  Over there, I enjoyed one of my all-time favorite brunches at the Daily Dos.  I was impressed that the PHX area did brunch/breakfast as well as some of my favorite stomping grounds in San Francisco.

So, on Saturday morning, after a night of partying and having multiple vodka club sodas in Old Town Scottsdale, I walked from my Marriott hotel in Tempe over to NCounter which I had looked up on Yelp.

I rolled up and, boy, was there a line! But, at 9am on a Saturday that says a lot about the reputation of this place.

After waiting for some time, I finally made it up to the counter.  As always, I was conflicted about whether to go for pancakes or the omelet. I like to load up on protein and go light on carbs/sugar, especially when I travel, so I went with the omelet.  Now at other brunch spots like Daily Dos, and my favorite places in Scottsdale, you could order a single pancake or French Toast as a side.  I didn't see either of those listed on the menu as sides, though I'm not sure if they would have made that accommodation upon request, so I won't dock a star for that.

So, I went with the \"loaded\" omelet, which loaded up on the meats (sausage, bacon, etc), and I had a side of cottage cheese and a cup of coffee.  Service was FAST.

The strong coffee was just what I needed as it lifted up my energy and morale which set me on a path to recovery from the night before :)

It was tough to find seating but I walked out to the patio and waited for a couple minutes and soon found some space.  It was a win because it was comfortably shaded which is critical in Arizona. Unlike DC, where I live, AZ heat is dry so as long as you're in the shade you're good to go, unlike humid heat.

At any rate, this is a SOLID brunch choice with quality food on deck.  This should be your main go-to spot for breakfast if you're in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"All of the omelettes are pretty good and the egg sandwiches are decent. Both the cold and warm sandwiches are awesome for lunch. Typically has pretty fast service and is a great place to come if you are trying to have a good breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Ncounter is freaking delicious! I got the CLASSIC EGG'S BENEDICT and dang was it good. So, so good. The place is a bit different. Go to the back and order and there isn't a lot of room for a line to form. It was a bit tight in line on a busy Saturday morning. But!!!! the line moved pretty quick and the staff was super nice. Even when the GF tried to order something the cashier said she would ring it in differently to save us money. SCORE!

Make your order, get the little table number thing and then wait for your delicious food.

If I had to change anything I'd say I want a bigger portion for hungry hippos like myself."}
{"text":"This place is a little too DIY for me. I placed my order at the counter, passing pre-prepared cups of orange juice and baskets of napkins. This should have been my one and only clue... But it was early and I was thinking with my \"hangry brain. \"

I ordered a latte and it was delivered to me without sugar options or stirs. So I got up to find the missing pieces to my beverage. 

My Eggs Benedict was delivered to me with silverware wrapped in a napkin, thank goodness for that much. Unfortunately, I'm a two-napkin (min) eater, so I needed a few more. This waitress was sweet and offered to fetch me some.

Now I know I wrote in my tip that the latte was decent, it was in fact very good. It was so strong that six packets of sugar later, it was slightly sweet. 

For a place that was loud and packed, I got my breakfast faster than expected. The kitchen is definitely doing something right. There is also outdoor seating if you don't want to sit inside the noisy mess hall.

Ncounter has this incredible opportunity to be more \"green\" if they chose to offer coffee mugs as well as paper cups. It's surprisingly cost-saving and since only the staff carries the dishes across the restaurant, low in risk of breakage.

Also, all of these napkins and utensil-bags could be compostable. And sugar packets switched out for sugar dispensers. Imagine if Ncounter was a zero waste/zero landfill establishment...

I only mention all of this because of the excellent job in branding this restaurant possesses. It's modern and open and clearly focused on efficiencies. There is even an Ncounter-branded bike locked up outside. All of this points to an earth-conscious brand, so I was a little disappointed to see the flagrant wastefulness inside.

Overall, I might be back for the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"love you for bringing me my breakfast and drinks.  eat at the bar, you can sit and order, instead of standing at the counter.  VIP  Moe Moe, I so so love,  I love your company today, thank you sista!  one love.  eat the pear omelet with out the bacon, you'll be happy.  get a salad instead of potatoes, it will make your brain even happier.  great greyhounds.  love vodka and grapefruit at places that can pull it off. thanks for being on mill."}
{"text":"The service here is far from good. It's often jam-packed with people so I opted for take-out on my last visit and it took over 30 minutes to get my food even though it was less hectic than usual. The order wasn't ready when I arrived. After about 15 minutes, I asked the girl at the counter if my order was ready yet and she said she wasn't sure. Another 10 minutes I inquired about the bag that had been sitting at the end of the counter the entire time. Turned out it was my order after all. She smirked at me before handing my food and walking away. 

But, on my first visit here, I finally tried Croque Monsieur for the first time and it was everything I'd hoped it would be.

5/10 will be back."}
{"text":"Joined some friends for brunch while I was in town. I ordered a delicious salad and great coffee, which arrived quickly, and we sat outside on the patio. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait on a Saturday during lunch-time. Over all I was impressed, especially since their prices were so reasonable. I will definitely go back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"I just can't get excited about this place. I've been several times and I would be hard pressed to remember what I ordered each time...besides that time I was on vacation and had many melon mimosa things at brunch. The food is fine, the service is prompt, and it mostly makes me miss SF or the east coast where this whole type of thing works much more efficiently with better food. Breakfast is okay, but there are better options if you can venture farther away from Mill Ave. Lunch is...forgettable. I feel like I have a special brand of NCounter amnesia as I cannot for the life of me remember anything about the last two (recent!) lunches I had there. If you like food at usual times of the day in the most inoffensive locale ever, this place is for you. Also, get a melon mimosa breakfast drink thing. They are good."}
{"text":"WOW!  Awesome breakfast!  This place is a gem.  The breakfast Burrito- specialty of the house, was sensational; filled with eggs, bacon, potatoes, cheese, avocado & chipolte sauce. The baked goods are all made in house.  The Cinnamon buns are a must try!  The service and staff are very friendly and accommodating.  It is truly an all American breakfast spot; a place that you will want to go back to over & over again.  Will have to try lunch next time.  Menu looks fabulous!"}
{"text":"Went out to eat for breakfast with a friend yesterday. Ordered the Santa Fe sautee's. The blend of chicken and veggies was perfectly spiced!! Liked the green tea I ordered as well. It was my first time and I will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"A great, modern, clean spot for a full breakfast without the diner feel. The menu is fresh with lots of brunch/breakfast/drink options with lighter substitutions if wanted. I ordered an omelet with the potatoes and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast.... Yikes! Fast pace order line...OK. Find a table...OK. Put your number/locator thingy on the table... OK. Waited for 42 mins....not ok! The servers or runners where doing just that ...running around trying to locate where whoever was sitting. Drinks showed up around the 15 min mark. It was just orange juice. Food...well .....the eggs were cold but the toast was warm ..a total sat under a heat lamp move till it was recognized as \"oh ,why isn't this order out yet\" should have been followed by a redo and manager  walk out explanation. 
Dunkin Doughnuts next time !"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite breakfast place for maybe 2 years? I live the French toast a lot of my friends get the huervos rancheros. 

For lunch my favorite is the chicken-Roma sand which. If you ask what the most popular lunch is they're likely to say this. Everything here is great though- and healthy!

The smoothies are bomb too!"}
{"text":"Drove from Scottsdale to eat here on my lunch today for their amazing wraps. I ordered the same one I always get (Parmesan Chicken Salad) and it wasn't quite the same as it normally is. 

I let them know and there was no hesitation. They remade it and brought it out to me promptly. I am pretty particular, but they were very accommodating during their busy lunch hour. 

The service and food quality here are always on point. Definitely my favorite Brunch place in Tempe."}
{"text":"this pl just opened up this year with a bang .. they must be very proud of themselves .. you did it right my friends, food is great"}
{"text":"I should preface by saying that I have not been here in almost 2 years, so I will go back soon and update! 

However, I would go there almost every Sunday when they first opened and I loved it. They always had a $5 drink special - mimosa, bloody mary, etc. and the pour was generous :) I have never had a meal that I did not like, and neither has the friends I've gone with. I love that I can get a breakfast sandwich with a salad instead of fruit or toast, and a bloody mary or 3 to top it off! Food portions are also generous! I would normally sit at the bar... if you're lucky enough to get a seat at the bar!"}
{"text":"1. Food handler took garbage away/back and started making drinks. No hand washing. Picked up lime and added to cust drink. Bleach !!
2. Eggs Benedict. Sauce tasted like American cheese and taters were cold.
Wouldn't come back..."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast food! I love how they have sriracha!!! That's essential for breakfast foods in my opinion! They also have fresh OJ. Will get that next time. Their pumpkin spice latte was ok."}
{"text":"First time there. Very crowed good thing weather was good outside. My husband loved his mushroom and ham omelet. I had the cheese omelette with sausage and bacon , very tasty but the cheese was not melted enough. You can still see the shredded cheese. But over all good, we may come back."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying the lunch here and the place was packed before noon on a Friday afternoon. Really tough finding a seat, but that was the worst part of the lunch. The sandwich I ordered, which I can't recall the name, had sliced turkey, bacon, cheddar and the key ingredient of sliced granny smith apples. It was those apples that gave this sandwich its unique taste and great flavor. Try the pasta salad as well, it was homemade and tangy good."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat!!! My wife had the breakfast burrito and it was amazing!! Even came with salad. I had the eggs benedict and they were fantastic. They came with potato's and a  wonderful hollandaise sauce. I regret not having their hot sand witches they looked amazing. Cant wait to go back!!! Just know that parking's tuff so you will have to find a parking garage."}
{"text":"It was a bit of a wait, but the food was good. I like the fact that they have a variety of options to choose from.

Unfortunately, the young blonde girl behind the to-go counter was quite rude to me after I had to double back and pick up the things they left out of my order. No regard to the inconvenience of the customer, not even an apology. Left a bad taste in my mouth, for sure"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE I JUST CAN'T NOT GET ENOUGH OF NCOUNTER!
the vibe is young clean and fresh. 
the good is so delish.. I keep telling all my friends to go here for brunch (:"}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Had the bananas foster French toast. Wow. Fresh orange juice. Bacon was great, not thin. The hot Juan omelette was good as well"}
{"text":"I went back to NCounter today at the request of management to give them another chance after my incident last week.  I meet with Daniel and he comped me another lunch.  I got the Chop Salad and it was awesome.  It had the normal salad stuff, but also included couscous, corn, cranberries, and feta cheese.  To top it off it came with a pesto dressing that was superb.

I work on Mill and appreciate a place to eat that's consistently good and has staying power.  NCounter is my new favorite!  I highly recommend it, everything I've tried has been delicious.  If the rating was just based on food alone I would have given them 5 stars.  For me, the atmosphere makes it a 4 star rating.  It's very eclectic and modern inside and perfect for this type of restaurant, however I prefer a little less noise so it's easier to talk to my lunch companions.

Thank you to the management of NCounter for restoring my faith in their customer service."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! The venue was a bit crowded/claustrophobic and the hours make it hard to get in when it is busy. Definitely worth it though!"}
{"text":"Always delicious no matter what we order, great breakfast items. This place is crowded during lunch but never slow and has a good amount of seating."}
{"text":"Food was good. It wasn't that busy but the cashiers seemed to be struggling; they messed up simple orders. Location on Central is better."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Tempe. Nothing special about the food, but they're consistent and I've always enjoyed whichever omelet I've gotten; although my go to is the Hot Juan. It can get pretty crowded though, so just be aware of that."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday morning after the early breakfast crowd had mostly parted and found a seat at the counter while waiting for the rest of my party.  Curtis was the man behind the counter this morning who recognized a few friends in the group and we decided to stay at the counter to continue the conversation and good service.  I ordered the morning glory served with seasoned tomatoes, diced onions, and sliced avocado on top of an airy bed of egg whites, an excellent choice and one I would order again.  By the time we left the brunch crowd filled in nearly all of the open seating."}
{"text":"It's good - good atmosphere, good food and drink, good prices. It gets very crowded on the weekends, so it does take some time from ordering at the counter, until your food gets brought out to your table.

It's nice and clean (it's on the upscale/trendy side for a breakfast spot), plenty of seating, indoors and out, and it's on Mill so it's right in the middle of the action. I would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Impersonal, cold and industrial feel and a bad batch of pancakes. The Tempe location has lots of charm and better cooks. I was expecting the pancakes to be of Tempe quality, but I got nothing baked into my pancakes. So, it was just the pancakes with bananas and walnuts on top. First off, the plate was too small for three giant pancakes and the syrup was of the poorest quality possible. Turns out that college kids are way more fun to watch eating than guys in suits and ties and retirees and North Scottsdale fake elite people."}
{"text":"Delicious!   Had the portobellini and market fresh eggs Benedict, everything tasted fresh, seasoned perfectly. Kids had chocolate chip pancakes which were huge and great.  Even loved the iced tea.  Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, great food, open seating and good service.  Recommend breakfast, I'll be back to try some of the sandwiches.  One person in our party had the grilled cheese and said it was best she's ever had!"}
{"text":"A beautiful Saturday late morning in Tempe calls for patio dining! Wanted breakfast and NCOUNTER was still serving, even got parking across the street, so it was meant to be!  Step inside to a very crowded restaurant, but the line to order moved very quickly.  My dining partner and I were having trouble deciding between the benedict, omelette and just plain ol' bacon and eggs.  We both ended  up going with 2 eggs over medium, bacon, toast and potatoes.  We found a great seat on the patio and waited for our food to come while enjoying the perfect weather and people watching. When the food came my dining partner had burnt toast, but that was quickly remedied and all was well.  It was a lot of food and it was delicious, eggs cooked perfect, I realized I should have ordered crispy bacon but it was good nonetheless because cmon its BACON!  They have a bar and offer Bloody Marys and Mimosas which I saw plenty of people enjoying."}
{"text":"I DISLIKE BEING LIED TO!!! 

We arrived this morning just before 9 and there were only two other tables occupied.  There were five in my group with only three of us eating.  We went up to the counter to order and as I walked past the beverage cooler, I grabbed a bottle of milk.  I ordered a veggie omelet at the counter and told the cashier about the milk.  She responded that she had already got the milk (this will come into play later in our experience).  The others in my group ordered and we paid on one bill.  The cashier gave us a metal stand with the letter \"Z\" carved out.  We set it on our table and waited for the food to be brought to us.
One of our group members had grabbed pecan roll for his breakfast, so technically we were only waiting for two hot breakfasts.  The first breakfast arrived after several minutes and the waiter did not take the metal stand with the \"Z\" so I believed my omelet was still on the way.  
We were talking and visiting and finally one of us commented on how much time it was taking for my meal.  I waited a bit longer then took the metal stand with the \"Z\" on it and asked a different cashier, the first cashier was no longer there, if she could check my order.  She gave me the typical brushoff that they were very busy, and the food was taking a while.  She did not ask when we ordered or what we were missing.  I explained that one of our breakfasts was brought out 10 minutes earlier and I was still waiting on a veggie omelet, and that it was not busy when we first came in.  She looked back at the kitchen, walked over to a plate, came back and said it was on its way.   I went back to our table, where everyone else was now waiting on me, and sat down.
I really dislike being lied to; I waited another six minutes, and when my food still had not arrived, I took the receipt and asked the second cashier if I could speak to a manager.  She made a snarky remark, did something else, then went in search of a manager.  The receipt showed that we had waited over 20 minutes for my meal, even though the other hot meal was delivered within six minutes.  The manager pulled up the transaction and said the veggie omelet was never ordered.   I was upset; if the first cashier had been more focused on her job than worried about someone getting away with a free milk, the omelet would have been ordered... AND had the second cashier taken the time to actually check the order, she would not have had to lie to me and say the food was on its way.
I gave them two stars instead of one because the manager made it right.  The veggie omelet came out within a couple of minutes of him discovering the problem.  The veggie omelet was good; nothing to write home about.  It had more cheese than veggies.  It was quite light on the veggies.  Honestly, Denny's makes a far better veggie omelet and it comes out in five minutes."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I love coming here for a late breakfast (great walk of shame parade constantly streaming in Friday through Sunday). Last time a kid from ASU had one arm tattooed to say God's and the other said Gift. Those sort of patrons and people watching makes this an automatic 5 star review. 

My go-to is the farmers benedict. The potatoes are amazing, and I love that there are endless bottles of hot sauce on deck. The service is quick and even when it's packed to the brim you will find a spot to sit."}
{"text":"A little pricey but great food and service. Thanks for the great time. My husband and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"stewardess can I have another drink? Nothing more than airplane food in a nice place won't return"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location. I always get the egg white omelette with avocado and Roma tomatoes. Very good and consistent from the Mill Ave location to this one. The coffee is so-so. Nothing to write home about. I enjoy a more robust rich coffee. I do like that they offer gluten free options including Belgium waffles. I especially like the gluten free chocolate cookie. Yum!
The patio is a little lacking of shade. We wanted to sit outside but too much direct sun and few umbrellas. Hopefully they will fix that issue now that it's patio weather. 
I would come back to this location again. Staff was friendly and it's very clean and tidy inside."}
{"text":"Been here at least 20 times over the past two years - not because it sucks. Ncounter is a great little restaurant, ambience has a modern/industrial feel and the location is perfect. Great food, great service and reasonable prices - most importantly they seem to be very consistent."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! The French toast was amazing with huge fluffy of cinnamon bread slices. I added on the sausage, eggs, and potatos which was a great addition too. I love the atmosphere, very chill and fresh. Lots of great options to choose from with yummy fresh Orange juice! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a brunch spot to bring some friends from out of town. From the reviews, seemed like a great place. Food was extremely mediocre. Felt like a Denny's with a trendy name and a few additional \"healthy\" options. 

I ordered the Ncounter omelette. The chicken wasn't seasoned, and added a bland flavor to the dish. I figured their signature omelette would be tasty, but no.

French toast was okay, but syrup was of poor quality. For the price we expected much more.

To top it off, they lost our friends order, so after 30 minutes we approached the counter about it and 12 minutes later it was served.... but by that time we were ready to go. Will never be back, it's nothing special. :/ boo, wanted a fun brunch."}
{"text":"Went there with a huge group of friends and family and received excellent service. Every dish that came out had mouth watering presentation and the service was amazing. Can't find a more hopping atmosphere. Special shout out to Taylor for hooking it up. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here last night for their soft opening and man, oh man they did not disappoint. This second location is certainly a little smaller than the original, but the food, drinks, and staff are just as amazing! I was absolutely stunned by the decor and lighting - they pull off that signature post modern look extremely well.

I had their croque monsieur benedict, which was a unique spin of the benedict. It had all the makings of a traditional New York benne, but the texture and hardiness of a French sandwich. Beautiful and scrumptious combination. Also, because I was feeling a bit adventurous, I grabbed their PB+J smoothie. I'd highly recommend you get it... you really have to experience it to understand how delicious it is!

All-in-all, a solid soft opening. A+ for sure. The food was definitely on point, every single one of the staff was friendly and clearly excited to be there, and the place was downright cute as a button. Ncounter's new location is well on it's way to becoming the new hot breakfast spot of downtown Phoenix. Can't wait to return when it's officially open!!"}
{"text":"I had a great first experience at N Counter and I will be back.

I'm always looking for a great breakfast spot and the location right on mill is extremely convenient. Their menu is amazing - it was so difficult for me to decide what I wanted, and I'm usually not indecisive when it comes to food decisions. The line was HUGE when we walked in the door - we almost decided to go somewhere else because we figured it would take forever. Wrong! We were probably in line for around 5 minutes; it was moving very quickly. After we ordered, our food came out very fast too. I was impressed. They obviously have their 'flow' down pat and were properly staffed for such a busy morning. 

I had the eggs n' chorizo, it was fantastic. The pear omelette caught my eye and I will definitely be trying it next time. A breakfast place that's in a decent price range that serves mimosas, bellinis, and bloody mary's? Count me IN! I will definitely be indulging the next time I stumble in after a rough night. 

Nothing much to say about the service. The girl at the counter was quick and efficient and our food came quickly too. You serve your own drinks and any accoutrements you might need (napkins, silverware, hot sauce, ketchup, sugar, etc) are on the counter next to the soda station for you to take at your convenience. 

Bottom line for me....the food was amazing, lots of awesome choices and innovative ingredient pairings, and the price was definitely right - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my typical Sunday am.. killer service and huge Bloody Marys! They have numerous flavors of bloody mary's that are all pretty awesome. The bartender \"Kurtis\" is always welcoming and spot on with customer service. Excellent outdoor bar area!!!"}
{"text":"Ooohh, this place is yummy! My family and I ordered our breakfast to go, but I look forward to eating at the indoor/outdoor bar next. 

The atmosphere walking in was modern, chic and hip with an open floor plan and a nice indoor/ outdoor vibe. 

Staff is super friendly and ready to accommodate anything you need. 

The food was awesome! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with a side salad instead of potatoes. The poached egg had the perfect amount of gooeyness and the hollandaise sauce tasted fresh, not 100% butter. Husband ordered the eggs, potatoes and toast with bacon and loved it! Bacon was cooked perfectly and potatoes had a great seasoning. The little girls orders scrambled eggs and bacon a la carts and chocolate chip French toast. Both loved their meals!!! 

Pricing was comparable to other breakfast joints such as daily dose, snooze, etc. A little pricey on some dishes, but super reasonable on others. 

I will definitely be back to try their morning drinks and to eat there. I highly recommend this place and look forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed my Bananas Foster French Toast while sitting out on the shaded patio.  Plenty of hot, self serve coffee.  The place was a little hectic because of the marathon going on outside.  I proudly ate my carbs in their honor."}
{"text":"Your experience at NCounter begins by paying the bill, giving the place a fast-food feel, which is fine until the bill comes in at thirty dollars for bacon, eggs, and coffee for two. (Hint: Don't make people decide on their tip before they see your service. Making waiters work for tips is bad enough without front-loading the decision on a customer who hasn't had their coffee yet.)

Food quality is average for a diner, about Denny's-ish. Coffee was bland and below-average strength. It won't pick you up if you're not a morning person. 

Bathrooms are clean and oddly stylish. 

Lastly, if you have crowd-anxiety, avoid this place on the weekends. I went on Sunday for breakfast and shared the school-cafeteria-like dining room with at least a hundred people.  

I really can't recommend it, overall. Noisy, crowded, and overpriced for what you get and the experience they provide."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for breakfast the other day. She got chocolate chip pancakes and hers looked delicious and she said it tasted just as good as it looked. I ordered a breakfast burrito and it was cheesy and delicious. Great place to get some food!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about the hipster vibe, but at the same time, hipsters do enjoy some tasty food.

I went with my husband and a friend, and we all had to order the bananas foster french toast.

OH MY SHIT.  BEST FRENCH TOAST EVER.  NO COMPARISON.

So gooey and thick and buttery and sweet and...

I have to stop before I drool on my computer."}
{"text":"Good for lunch and breakfast. The potatoes were salt less and the tortilla soup was drenched in salt. My favorite thing was the cinnamon jelly that came with an english muffin. Overall, wouldn't come back due to the inconsistent flavors. Had to do a quick stop at starbucks after just to satisfy my appetite."}
{"text":"Wow! I was very fascinated how fast our food came out! The food was fast and it was very delicious! The service was great too. Everything was great! The place is very modernized. Great food!"}
{"text":"Ncounter has never disappointed me. I been going to there Mill Ave location and I am so happy for them to be expanding more and more. This location is so convenient to my work and I will definitely be going here allot. They have the best service and their food is very basic but good. Like always, their Ncounter omelet is my favorite! I got their strawberry banana smoothie this time and it was fresh."}
{"text":"I've been to NCounter a couple of times now, and i am pleased to say I rather like it. The first time I ordered the pear omelet, which I remember scarfing down in a state of sweet, cheesy, eggy bliss. I also had a greyhound - fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and vodka - which really made my day for two reason: first, it combines three of my favorite things (grapefruit, vodka, greyhounds), and also because the juice is fresh. 

My second time there I got the Farmer's Market, which is there vegetarian version of eggs Benedict: English muffin, tomato, spinach, avocado, poached egg, hollandaise. Yum. Most of the dishes are paired with potatoes, and I am happy to report that these are also excellent. Many of the breakfast potatoes around are mediocre at best, but there are nicely seasoned and cooked just right. I paired my meal with a cappuccino, the only disappointing part of my experience. If you want a cappuccino made the traditional way, with equal parts espresso, steamed milk and foam, then order it dry. Otherwise you will be served a latte. Send it back and you will be served another latte. Say something to the barista and you will be informed that you are wrong. Ah well, this really isn't such a big deal since there is a clear way around it. 

NCounter will likely be making it into the regular rotation of breakfast places, especially on days when a breakfast cocktail is in order."}
{"text":"I came here because I needed coffee, and needed to be in this area.

However, I would have been better off walking the 2 blocks and just getting Starbucks, which has its flaws, but hands-down better than this.

The ordering is weird, you can order at the counter (which is not the coffee bar) or sometimes at the coffee bar. 

But the espresso shots - not sure what to say about it, I think my office K-cups tasted better than my $4 latte. 

but the people eating there for breakfast seemed to be enjoying themselves...."}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch (and breakfast if I'm ever up early). Everything I've had so far is good, and any friends  I have in town I always make sure to stop here. If you like New-American food you will love this place!"}
{"text":"We got the chipotle breakfast burritos to go and they were delish!! I've also dined inside and this is a fun and cute spot to grab breakfast or lunch... really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Last week was my fist time going to Ncounter. I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly and helpful the staff were. The food was ready very quickly and tasted fantastic! High-five to the cooks! Even went back to tip the staff more once we finished our food. After last week, I returned today with several friends. It was much busier, but again, had wonderful service and the food was outstanding. This place is definitely a weekly hitter for me! Recommending to all my friends!"}
{"text":"This location always seems to be on point. I order in and to-go. Really enjoy the ncounter omelet and the bloody Mary's. Lots of great options for breakfast lovers. Service is usually pretty quick as well. 

Taylor has his customer service on point. He definitely provided a top notch dining experience."}
{"text":"FINALLY.  It's about time something worthy of this location took over.  This place is perfect if I feel like being a jerk to my waistline or light and healthy.  Service is smart and efficient which is awesome since NO ONE likes lines.  I just wish they stayed open later :/"}
{"text":"Dishes are good and big portions.  It's a great place to go anytime . Even on your lunch break because they're always fast. LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Great food, location and service.   The. Best French toast    The omelette's are great too.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We waited for so long for our food. They forgot about our order and didn't seem to care when we asked about it. People came in way after us and already ate there food before we got our order. When our order came, the banana foster French toast I ordered, we so drowned in maple syrup, it was disgusting. I love maple syrup but this had a half gallon of it. Then the chipotle burrito my friend order had no chiptole sauce and was tiny. What a waste of $25. I don't recommend this place. The service is awful."}
{"text":"So I went to N Counter last week, had a terrible experience! I went as far to write a letter to 3 email addresses listed on their site... and no response. So here it is :)

To who it may concern:

 
   I just arrived back from lunch at N Counter and am still considerably upset at just what happened. I tried to use the contact 
us button on your website but it appears there is no confirmation when trying to hit send. 
  I was able to leave my office and enjoy a lunch date with my boyfriend, which is very important to me since we have conflicting schedules.  We jokingly argued where to eat lunch, I wanted N Counter for your great salads and he wanted to go to Cheba Hut for their big sandwiches... I won.  Since I am eligible for expenses at my job, when I approached the register I told the cashier clearly before ordering that I needed to pay for mine separately and will need an itemized receipt for reimbursement.  I ordered clearly a Fushion Chopped Chicken salad and a soda, he then swiped my card.  I bring up my order because I have had in the past received the wrong chopped salad because I didn't say Fusion, always learn from my mistakes, right?  After swiping my card, he said he needed to wait for my boyfriends order for an itemized receipt so our food was on the same ticket.  I let him know, that's fine as long as my receipt included my food only.  Of course after J ordered, swiped his card and the itemized receipt had all of our food on it.  I was very disappointed, because I was very clear and polite on what I needed.  After he pulled the receipt, he asked if it would be a problem?  Yes, it is actually... that's why I asked twice. So the young man went and got a \"manager\" which may be one of you on this email, he looked at me and said it was not possible to get a different receipt. I explained my needs to the manager and let him know I asked twice,  I was very frustrated to say the least but remained professional.  I then was told by the manger to \" CALM DOWN\".  I was in complete shock, I couldn't believe it.  He said this to me in front of a full line of people, I was so embarrassed.  He put in the order again, with a no make and handed me the receipt and I walked away.  I usually speak up for myself when necessary but I had no words for his behavior towards me as a customer.  We sat down outside, I am trying to shake it off and enjoy the rest of my lunch hour.  The runner brought our food and it was the wrong salad, I questioned it politely and said I ordered the Fushion chopped.  She just stared at me and I felt very uncomfortable, so I offered to take the salad and interest of eating with my boyfriend.  She then offered to get me the proper lunch.  Again I was flustered.  The salad came quickly and was able to salvage  some of my lunch date, when she dropped the salad off we realized we never got the cupcake we paid for on the second bill so we had to ask for that too.  So all in all, what usually is a fantastic  or generally okay experience and a great lunch or breakfast was awful, embarrassing, waste of time and money.  I work very hard for everything in my life, my time is important to me, I treat everyone with respect and kindness and don't deserve to feel how I am feeling this afternoon after leaving your establishment. Next time... Cheba Hut!

Respectfully,

N"}
{"text":"Mine and my families favorite spot for brunch. Everything and I mean everything is amazing here! Sautées, Smoothies, Spicy Bloody Marys, Egg Bene's, Pancakes, French Toast, Salads, Soups.....everything on their menu. We tend to make this a frequent spot to grab a bite to eat. If you want to feel even more rewarded by your visit & paying the $2 to park per hour.....take a hike up A Mountain before you enjoy your meal. Nice views of Phoenix and an intense leg workout. Then amazing food! You gotta try it. :)"}
{"text":"Fuck this place.  Run by a bunch of kids who don't give a shit about service. 

Had pretty good experiences before, but today was the last straw.  

They \"lost\" our order and no apology was made after 30 min of waiting.  

Also saw someone next to us complain someone licked the fork in the orange bin and they didnt change it out after hearing about it. 

Saw 2 orders get sent back because they were wrong.  

Couldnt find our order ticket but immediately found it when I asked them to cancel it out because we were going to miss our movie."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place was yesterday for lunch, and I ordered the veggie omelette. I specifically asked the guy taking my order if there was any dairy in the omelette and he said yes, there was milk in the egg mixture. But he then said that they could make it special for me, and crack the eggs fresh (I'm extremely lactose intolerant). When it was delivered to my table, I again asked them if they were sure there wasn't dairy in it, and they said it was fine. I ate it with a side of fruit, and I have to say it wasn't bad, actually pretty tasty. When I got home though... that's when all heck broke loose. Extreme bloating, stomach cramps that made me feel like I was dying, and oh the diarrhea. My guess is that they forgot to make it \"fresh\" for me. So disappointing. I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Pleased by the concept of this tasty treat along bustling Mill Avenue.  The wait on a Sunday morning (accompanied by a street festival) wasn't more than 10 minutes, and ample tables to choose from.  Cordial wait staff, a neat outdoor patio and one heck of a soup of the day.  I ordered the bacon burrito which was tasty-could have used a higher portion of bacon.  Overall nice dining experience, and prices are about right, maybe a tad high for portion size."}
{"text":"The food is good. Would give 4 starts except  I guess somewhere along the line I became an old man.. But something about 10am shoulder to shoulder with tons of people and techno from the DJ.. If you have a hangover avoid!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch spot with a nice pet-friendly outdoor patio.  

I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was PACKED.  You order at the counter, they give you a  \"letter\" to place on your table and someone will bring you the food (a bit like corner bakery). I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was really good...not too heavy. Great location and ambiance."}
{"text":"great people, great food, great time. mimosas on deck, chocolate chip waffles on deck, potatoes and bacon and french toast on deck; ncounter on deck"}
{"text":"I was up at 4 a.m. today.  Did a load of laundry, watered the plants, highlighted my hair, did some cleaning, unloaded the dishwasher, cleaned the pool, and patiently waited for my husband to wake up.  At 6:30 I pretended to drop something and woke him up.

I said, \"Hey!  Wanna try someplace new for breakfast?!?!?\"

He got dressed, put on his shades, and got in the car.  I love that man so much.

My goal was to get to Ncounter right when they open because I have read about how busy they get.  

I really liked how pleasant and sunny the restaurant was, and ordering at the counter was easy.  We got the Greek omelet, the basic 2-egg breakfast with bacon, and a mocha.  They have nice sized water cups too.  This time of year I really appreciate that.  

My Greek omelet was really nice.  Full of veggies and feta cheese.  Great flavors.  I also enjoyed the rye toast and what tasted like homemade apple cinnamon preserves.  Mr. M's 2 egg breakfast was very good as well.  The bacon was OUTSTANDING!  And I wish I would have shoved the toast aside to get a picture of the potatoes that came with his breakfast.  They were fried or roasted to a nice golden brown and really went well with the egg yolks.  

My mocha was delicious as well.  Did I see they use Press coffee?  That totally makes sense.  I loved it.  With two breakfasts and the mocha, the total was $21.62 before tip.  

I did happen to notice all the very fit people in the restaurant who looked like they just biked around Tempe Town Lake, or climbed that hill to the east of the restaurant.  I did none of those things.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Everything here is great. Full of students. Healthy options if you want, plenty of sweets, good iced coffee. Salads are substantial, sandwiches wide-ranging. Go to lunch spot in Tempe."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Freshly squeezed orange juice. Big slices of bacon. Moist waffles with syrup. No table service. Park on Mill street, metered parking. Two locations available. Tempe has side yard you can bring your dog, as long as on a leach."}
{"text":"Wasn't terrible, but by no means memorable. I was in town with my family for the Cardinals game and we decided to go here for breakfast. Not a bad choice but very underwhelming. We all preferred Snooze."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast place, I wish they would another cashier at the cash register since they have 2 of those, the line wouldn't be that long if they did. I GOT A DIRTY FORK WITH FOOD STILL STUCK TO IT. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars cause of the food."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place unfortunately was disappointed. We  literally waited an entire hour for our food.
When it finally arrived my eggs were cold. The \"spicy\" bloody mary was way too sweet for my taste. I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"I was in Tempe for Ironman AZ (spectating my awesome IronMOM) and stopped here twice.  The place opened at 4am for the event, so we were able to stop in for coffee and a scone after we dropped off our racers.  They were ready for the crowd and although the line was long, it moved quickly and the staff was friendly.  The coffee was good and the scone was tasty.
After loop one on the bike we decided we needed something more substantial than a scone (spectating is hard work!) and returned to NCounter for lunch.  It was packed.  But again, although there was a line, it moved quickly and the staff was friendly.  A table opened just before we got to the cashier and I grabbed it.  We both had the vegetarian omelet with a side of toast.  I don't know what the jam was but it was tasty!  I think it may have been an apple cinnamon?  Very Fall flavorful.  The omelet was big and full of good veggies and cheese.  Everything was fresh and it wasn't at all greasy.  It came out nice and hot.  I would have eaten here again had I stayed longer.  Good job NCounter!"}
{"text":"I guess Sunday is not a good day to go, to start with they had a long line for just ordering, then afterwards you look for a seat, thank God the food was awesome it made it all worthy."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened. It's definitely on the trendy side. The sandwich was really good with fresh meat, vegetables and bread. The flavors are unique - again, trendy to match the place, but quite good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my family and our dog- we wanted to go somewhere that is dog friendly and has good food and drinks. We sat outside and went to the counter to order. You order food and non-alcoholic drinks inside and real drinks at the bar in the middle. Since we were starving we got a couple muffins from the display case to eat while we waited for our food. Sadly these were frozen and so dry... not the best way to start our meal. Since this place is only partial self-service we couldn't find utensils anywhere and had to ask, I guess they bring these out with your meal and not before. The best tasting thing I had was the PB&J smoothie and the prettiest was the cobb salad. 

I would come back here for the smoothie and the ability to bring our dog, but it wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Cute little breakfast place, it was clean and had a nice atmosphere. 
I made up my own egg combo with spinach and avocado, and they were very accommodating.  Not too pricey. 
I would come here again."}
{"text":"NCounter is located on the North end of Mill Ave, near the PHX Metro Light Rail track.  As much as I hate going out to eat on Mill Ave, due to the stressful moments I have trying to find parking, this place is definitely worth it.

The restaurant has a modern industrial feel to it, as the color scheme is black, white, and gray with orange accents. It's very trendy and has a \"underground hipster\" feel to it.  Very appropriate for its college town location.  They have a large patio section surrounded by trees which makes brunch on a February afternoon seem like you're relaxing in paradise. 

Service there is very laid back.  You place your order at the front counter, you're given a letter (N.C.O.U.N.T.E.R. which I thought was pretty clever) to bring to your table as you wait for a server to deliver your food.  You serve your own drinks and retrieve any extra napkins or utensils you may need for your meal.  Seating is all first come first serve based, and the restaurant is even dog friendly.  I was really excited to see a cute Shitzu getting tangled up under a neighboring table. 

The only thing that I didn't like was the line formation when ordering.  Tables and chairs are set up down the center of the restaurant in an angular position and you are forced to maneuver your way around other guests as you walk to the back counter to place your order.  Even there, space is limited; which results in you waiting in line- standing a foot away from customers trying to enjoy their meal. 

Once in line, I was struggling with deciding on an meal.  There is so much variety to choose from.  I got to the counter expecting to see only breakfast items (waffles, pancakes, omelettes, etc) but they also offer a selection of soups, salads, and sandwiches.

For the most part, NCounter is a great spot to visit for brunch if you're in the Tempe area.  I really enjoyed the ambiance and the quick service.  It's probably not something that I would necessarily make the trip for if I wasn't living in the area- but that also comes hand in hand with the fact that I hate parking on Mill. :)"}
{"text":"Walk in coffee bistro and counter order. 
No waitress. Self serve. I was looking for more of a sit down order. 
Outside eating looking at trail. 
Near missions palm airport and hotel 
Eat outside or inside."}
{"text":"There's a parking garage you can park in. First 15 mins is free so you don't need a validation if you will be quick. It's a good breakfast/brunch place. They do have a patio so you can sit outside. You can also order from UberEats."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix's restaurant culture is certainly vibrant, but also not for the faint of heart.  Summer time in particular is a tricky time to run a restaurant down here.  Lots of people are on vacation, the downtown college campuses are ghost towns, and the brutal weather means lots of patio spaces go unused.  But with thousands of new apartment units coming into neighborhood as of when I write this, you're starting to see more and more restauranteurs get bullish about the area's swelling permanent residents.  NCounter is just the latest example of this confidence.  NCounter's flagship location in Tempe has been on my breakfast radar for quite awhile, but I hadn't yet made my way out there.  As it turned out, NCounter decided to open a second location here in Downtown as the first ground floor restaurant at the new Union @ Roosevelt apartment complex.  With a day off from work on a Tuesday, I made my way here for breakfast.

The location can be easy to pass by if you don't know where to look.  On the southwest corner of Roosevelt and 1st Avenue, you'll find the Union @ Roosevelt apartment complex.  On the east side of the building (a few steps south of Roosevelt) stands NCounter.  1st Avenue south of Roosevelt is a southbound only street so just look for it on your right side.  As its just walking distance for me, I didn't have to worry about parking.  However per my server it sounds like they don't yet have an agreement with the Union complex for parking, so you'll need to find your own parking somewhere in the neighborhood.  My advice would be to try either (1) the public parking garage next to Fez on Central & Portland, or (2) find a street parking spot on the north side of the Union complex or (3) see if there's an open spot at the KZON/KMLE radio station lot across the street.

NCounter's new location is a solid urban style restaurant setup, with plenty of space but all in close proximity to the hustle and bustle of 1st Avenue.  There's room for probably 50-60 inside with another 40 or so seating on the patio outside.  We're still in the middle of summer as of my writing this so I just walked inside and grabbed a spot at the bar.  The menu is identical to their Tempe location with choices of omelettes, benedicts, sandwiches, and other (mostly) traditional breakfast fare.  One item that jumped out at me from the get go however was the Croque Monsieur.  On the bottom is a thick cut of sourdough bread from MJ Bread (owned and run by local valley chef Tammie Coe).  On top of that are two fried eggs, gruyere cheese, ham, tomato, and a creamy mustard sauce.  I'd had a dish similar to this at Fame Caffe in central Phoenix, so I was eager to see how this stacked up.  I also ordered one of their strawberry-banana smoothies with strawberry, banana, orange juice, and yogurt.  Total cost for the food including tax and tip came to about $21.

The Monsieur was extraordinary.  A rich, creamy, savory dish and the bread does a great job supporting and absorbing the flavors.  I particularly liked the cuts of ham and the mustard sauce.  The smoothie was also delicious with a taste that was slightly sweet, but not tart thanks to the mellowing effects of the yogurt and bananas.  A good hearty breakfast to get my day underway.  The service I received was excellent, the food came out quickly, and the aesthetic layout made dining here a very pleasant experience indeed.

We'll see how it goes for NCounter down here.  There's no shortage of other breakfast spots in the neighborhood (Matt's, Fair Trade Cafe, Lola, DeSoto Market, and Be Coffee just to name a few) and NCounter's lack of street visibility and parking access will present some early challenges.  But hopefully word of mouth and their distinguished reputation in Tempe will keep them around Downtown for a good long while.  Great to have NCounter down here and a great first impression from my new neighbor."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and love this place! Fresh food, quick service, clean and cool casual atmosphere. I would recommend the \"killer\" sandwich and the egg white omelette with avocado. And it's at the light rail stop. :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast was fast and plentiful. The service was great. The staff gave special attention to the kids in our party which I greatly appreciated. They were patient and communicative."}
{"text":"Seeing an absolutely packed restaurant at noon on a Sunday is definitely a good sign that the food will be well worth the wait. People line up around the restaurant to order/pay at the counter and then scour the place to find an empty table (or patiently wait until someone leaves to get a free spot). The menu is decently-sized, with lots of great breakfast and lunch options. The bar is small but features the classic breakfast boozey items as well as traditional cocktails. 

I ordered the farmer's sandwich which is a fried egg on ciabatta bread, ham, red onions and cheese (with an ordered addition of avocado) served alongside some greens and cherry tomatoes. For $7 I thought the sandwich was decently sized (was only able to finish half of it) and pretty generous in the portion of ham and veggies. The sandwich was definitely tasty, no foodgasm here but a good start to my morning. The caramel latte was creamy but overly sweet and their regular coffee was a tad watery. I do appreciate the free coffee/tea refills and the oranges/lemon wedges for the water. That was a huge plus for any coffee drinker that needs at least a couple of rounds to fully wake up.

Overall a good breakfast spot on Mill for people of any age. The crowd is very mixed- from the walk-of-shamers to the after-church goers and everything in between. Its a pain in the ass that you can't order at your table, but they seem to be pretty successful in their current system, so props to them,"}
{"text":"Um, is this place a joke?

I really don't understand how this place has so many good reviews.  I came here because it seemed popular, and had a pretty good rating on Yelp.... but I really don't understand how... maybe all the ASU kids are impressed by the modern interior design?  Maybe they're sick of their meal plan food?  Or maybe people are just hungover and any breakfast food tastes good...

Anyways...

-The service was awful.  
Not one single person had a personality or even a glimpse of a smile.  There was about 20 people \"working\"... but doing absolutely nothing.  Workers were just aimlessly wandering around the dining room, standing behind the counter in a daze, or fist bumping their friends talking about how wasted they got the previous night (no joke).

-The place was a mess.
There was food and garbage ALL over the ground.  The drink station countertop was a sticky disgusting mess... spills, lemon seeds, used napkins allll over it.  The place was pretty busy, but any empty table was still covered in the previous customer's dishes and food mess.  (Which I didn't understand since there were 3 workers wandering around the dining room at all times).  I had to flag down a dazed employee and ask them to clear a table off for me.  And of course he just wiped even more food onto the already disgusting floor.  Seriously, food ALL over the floor.  Gross.

-The food took forever and was cold.
We waited about 25 minutes for a super simple order of food.  I got the Farmer's Market.  The whole entree was cold.  And NOBODY likes cold soggy potatoes.  It was supposed to have avocado on it, but it had one mere sliver.  My boyfriend's food was also cold, and he didn't eat it.  We would have said something to someone... about a refund or getting at least warm-ish food instead, but everyone was too busy wandering around in a zombie daze, and at that point, I just wanted to get the hell out of that disgusting place.

And there was awful music playing... like music that plays really loud in a club.  Like loud Britney Spears and hip-hop.  It was just weird.  

I would never come back here, and would advise anyone (unless you like cold food, disgusting places, and awful service) to try another place for breakfast/lunch instead.

Ew."}
{"text":"A new place in the general vicinity - gotta check it out!

We showed up and found Ncounter tucked in the back, just north of White Chocolate Grill.

The space is nicely decked out and looks very contemporary.

Fast casual concept, so up to the counter to order...I decided to try the \"Killer\" breakfast sandwich - bacon, gorgonzola, tomato, thyme, fried egg on Ciabatta (I think?), with fried potatoes.  (Presentation was nice - rectangular plates seem to be the thing these days.)

The sandwich was pretty good, but tasted a bit like they're trying too hard...not sure if it was the gorgonzola, the thyme?  Anyway...pretty good, but not sure I'd get it again.

My buddy ordered the huevos and chorizo - said it tasted like ketchup - he was less impressed.

Probably worth another shot..."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the delicious chilaquiles to celebrate her b-day. She encountered a small problem and let a server know. The manager on 6/3, Daniel, was so incredibly helpful. He was friendly and quickly solved the issue. His professional and welcoming manner made us feel both comfortable and special. 
We love Ncounter for the food and now, we adore it for the service as well. Daniel is terrific!
We'll be back and will for sure order the chilaquiles and lemon pound cake."}
{"text":"Dont let long line to order intimidate. Very efficient kitchen and friendly staff. Food arrived hot and our omelettes were delicious. Prices very reasonable especially for quality and quantity. We loved sitting on patio, too. No surprise it is so busy!"}
{"text":"I've been here over 10 times. Just like any restaurant it can be a hit or miss but for the most part  N Counter is definitely a hit! I started going here in college. My boyfriend and I would go hiking A mountain and after spending hours burning off fat we would go straight to N Counter for breakfast ( located at but not exactly at the base of A mountain)

Enviorment/Location:  To be exact N Counter is located in the heart of Mill Avenue in downtown Tempe. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from ASU  (Go Sundevils!). The actual resturaunt is super cozy and inviting. In the spring/summer we like to sit outside and soak in the enviorment. 

Food: I can never go back to I-hop after this place. Food is always fresh, always hot and 9/10 times always  freaking delicious. Everyone I take here, loves it. The portions are also pretty decent.

Service: you pay at the counter so you don't exactly have a waitress but the staff is always friendly and happy. Food is served pretty quickly, so no unnecessarily long waits

Price: I was there two day ago and  got: a loaded egg white omelet,  potatoes, a side of bacon, and a peach Bellini (alcoholic) =$19.50

I would recommend you try!"}
{"text":"It was OK.

My boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich and soup, so at least there's that. I had the strawberries & cream french toast...it was pretty cold. I'd give it a second shot for the lunch fare. The location is nice and the decor was cute. The food was just nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast Sunday morning and had a great experience.  This place is very popular, so be prepared to wait a little bit...but it's worth the wait!  I enjoyed an egg white veggie omelette with a side of fruit.  It was just the right portion and very tasty with peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes and zucchini.  Definitely a great place to grab breakfast in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Usually pretty quick service, food is always consistent and you get really good sized portions. Eggs are done perfect every time! always very good about food allergies"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm really disappointed about my experience here. I've heard nothing but great things about this place and after wanting to come here for a couple months, it did not live up to expectations.

I ordered the loaded omelette, which I recognize has a lot of meat and cheese, however my first bite was pure grease. The potatoes that it came with were undercooked and not seasoned. Then, halfway through my meal I discovered a hair on my plate, which made my appetite completely dissipate. 

This meal in total (omelette, sandwich, and coffee) cost was above average. I don't believe this place was worth the money."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty good stuff. I usually come here for breakfast with my brother on saturdays after a night out for some recovery drinks at their bar and my usual favorite sandwich, \"The natie bomb\"."}
{"text":"Very nice new chain breakfast lunch place on 1st Ave & Roosevelt. They serve beer, great coffee roasted by Cartel. First time here and I like it! My breakfast sandwich was very good."}
{"text":"Ordered Ncounter omelet and was very disappointed with the quality and taste. They use WAY too much Hollandaise and cream cheese. It tastes like something that was put together by a person with no culinary skills. They need to bring in a chef to re-evaluate the menu. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for both breakfast and lunch and the food was luscious. I want to try everything on the menu. Best thing to happen to Mill Ave. in years."}
{"text":"We went there the last two days since we participated in both days of the Rock N Roll Marathon and found it to very inconsistent. 1st day my food and my daughters food was hot and good even though they forgot the sauce for my burrito, but my wife's food was warm at best. Today I went back with my daughter and again they forgot my sauce for the burrito and my daughters pancakes were RAW in the middle! How does that happen? Then I noticed that they microwave the food before it's taken out to make it seem fresh and hot. Very deceptive and disappointing."}
{"text":"Loved the eating environment, very laid back, food is tasty!  We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Amazing staff, Gabbie and Jordan were very attentive and gave me full attention.  Had the oatmeal and a side of egg whites, which were awesome. Very cute! Will definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"NCounter might be my favorite new lunch spot. There, I said it. This Mill Avenue spot is tucked away on the quieter North end of Mill, but it deserves a visit. With a large outdoor patio, a beautiful atmosphere and DELICIOUS food, this gem is definitely worth paying for parking. 

The Cobb Sandwich is one of the best lunch picks I've ever made. With a side salad, it's the perfect meal. All the sandwiches are tasty, so you can't go wrong. And with a case of sparkly baked goods, you can round off your day with a delicious cupcake or cookie. 

Stop by. You'll be so glad you did."}
{"text":"Overall, very impressed with my meal here.  You walk in, order your food and then seat yourself.

I ordered a simple eggs, toast and potatoes.  It was good and filling.  The rest of my group ordered other things.  One of the comments that stuck out to me was \"Honestly I could have ordered any of the things we got and been satisfied.\" 

I would definitely come back to this place if I am back in the Tempe area again."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place with great gluten free options especially for people with gluten intolerances! The food was so fresh tasting. Definitely a step up from your typical run on the mill breakfast place. Has has the professionalism and ambiance of a chain and the quality and taste of a mom and pop place! 5/5 would eat here again! I enjoyed the Encounter Omelet and a delicious Nitro Cold Brew coffee from Coffee Cartel (can't go wrong there)."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for leading us to this little gem of a place on Mill Ave. From the quality of the food, the friendliness of the staff, to the ambiance, this place is fantastic! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ncounter is pretty adorable inside, cool decor, great location. Everytime I have been it's been uber crowded, which, after the third time, gets old. Good for them, but it really kills the vibe whilst screaming over brunch/lunch. The cashier/order window is in the left- back, so fight your way passed the packed tables and stand in line to order. They are pretty good about getting the food out quickly and the food...well it's decent. Their sandwiches are very good, the breakfast burrito - ehh, I've had much better. 

Overall, nice spot to check out for breakfast/brunch that isn't as pricey as Harlows, with a chic, modern atmosphere. But if it's crowded and you value relaxing conversation, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great location and interior design.  Food looked great and diners appeared pleased.  I only had coffee.  Gave the young lady behind the counter the benefit of this was their first open weekend but she couldn't seem to enter a latte in the order machine.  They need to operate coffee bar more like a coffee bar.  BUT the coffee was lukewarm and awful.  Later tried plain doffs rom the coffee dispensers.  Tasted like Folgers!  Please, you are a breakfast place- get great coffee and skip the self serve canisters."}
{"text":"Nice location, great food, decent service, cool ambiance, fair prices and great consistency. Expect them to always be busy though and to wait for seating. Also, they are not shy about wanting to turn over tables so don't expect to linger too long."}
{"text":"NCounter is hands down the best place on Mill Ave and in the Tempe area for breakfast and lunch. Although it can get quite busy/crowded at times the wait for food is never too long and always worth the wait. The staff is always friendly and the atmoshpere is great. Some of my favorites include the chipotle egg burrito and the urban caesar salad but the portebellini sandwich is by far the best thing on the menu! No matter what you order it will be delicious and made with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"We went in on a holiday so it was expected that it would be busy. We waited in line, ordered and then were confused if the food would come to us or what. We ordered two different smoothies, both weren't good. I can't say gross, but wouldn't get them again. It took about 40 mins to get our food, my chilaquiles were a big cold by the time I got them, but were good. My husband got an omelette and said he wouldn't come back. I wouldn't come back, much better places out there."}
{"text":"A friend and myself went and had brunch this afternoon and randomly chose this place. The style of service is a little different as you order at a counter then they deliver your food. We did so and sat at the bar not knowing we could have ordered and had full service there. We decided to stay at the bar and I assumed the bartender/barista/smoothie ninja would have been irritated because we already ordered and paid for our food. I totally get it as I over see 4 locally owned restaurants. Gabbie on the other hand was very welcoming and took great care of us while shaggin drinks for the entire place. Her service was spot on and very sweet. She's the reason for the 5 stars. Job well done Gabbie!;)"}
{"text":"I had the Farmer's Market: basically a benedict with spinach, tomato and avocado.  Delicious.  Hollandaise was good, ingredients were fresh, and coffee was pretty good.  My only complaint is the home fries.  They were those frozen type you can get that are too salty and dry out fast.  Fresh potatoes would be so much better.  Other than that, a hit."}
{"text":"I have stopped in twice since NCounter has opened in my neighborhood and enjoyed both experiences.  The first time I met a coworker and enjoyed a blueberry blast smoothie and this weekend we stopped in and I enjoyed a Santa Fe saute - lots of food and very reasonably priced.  Super friendly staff, bright and airy restaurant, fun atmosphere and tasty food...we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Intended on going to another restaurant but it was closed due to electrical issues in the kitchen. However, it's a good thing we came to Ncounter. They were extremely quick on getting us food, customer service was top notch, and the food was incredible!  I will certainly be coming back for a weekend breakfast very soon."}
{"text":"Best Omelet i ever had. And may father said the same. Very good service. Ill be going there again soon."}
{"text":"Come here if you are 

1. a sun devil
2. too young or too old to go to be at the breakfast club
3. want to go to the breakfast club but are too drunk to drive, walk please.

its located downtown, its crowded, its youthful, its noisy, its got decent food, creativity is decent, food taste pretty good.  

u go up and order and pay, they bring the food to you.  the crew is energetic and would do their best to fight thru the crowd to bring your food to you, bring your sauces to you :)  U get your own drink, just be careful not to run over anyone thats hungover.

for old farts like me, this is quite a nice place because it captures some of the ASU campus spirit when you are here.  it kind of reminds U of the MU at lunch time (I am sure its still busy as hell now)

come here, order some coffee, eat an omelette, oh but bring a friend, so someone can watch the seats while the other go order.  its very crowded and mostly first come first serve.  try to limit your party to like 4 or 8 people or 12, u get the idea, the tables seat 4, so if worse come to worse, you can split up to 2-3 tables but still fit everyone in."}
{"text":"I can't leave any visit to Ncounter without an order of their grilled potatoes. These are literally the tastiest things in the world and soar far above most of their other menu items I tried. Yum."}
{"text":"This place is really really delicious. I love that it's so casual and you can order at the counter so everyone can get what ever they want without having to worry about the bill at the end. The ambiance is clean yet comforting, almost diner like but staying classy all the way. But, the highlight is all about the food. I got the farmers market benedict and oh man, it was as good as a lot of brunch benedicts I've had in other parts of the country. It was so very fresh and the potatoes are crisped so crispily and wonderfully. Definitely my favorite place in Tempe."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito I had was so good I almost passed out.  This place is highly recommended for anyone wanting an upscale brunch experience."}
{"text":"I frequent downtown often for little coffee shops and brunch and just happeneded to stumble across this place. I was a bit skeptical when my buddy got the Red Velvet waffles but after take a bite of his waffles I found myself wanting to switch plates, he decline my offer. 
I ordered a loaded bacon omelet which was amazing and their potatoes are delicious."}
{"text":"My second time here. Always been great. Was expecting it to be super crowded for a Sunday at noon, but I hardly had to wait. 

Had the Chipotle breakfast burrito which was great, accompanied with a great cold brew coffee. Sat around and read a book for an hour in a lively environment. Definitely coming back. Turn up!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service. Bad review though towards who appeared to be the manager talking loudly about how his employee is going to regret only \"being with two women\". Then he goes on to talk about screwing around with women and because you've been with them one night doesn't mean \"you need to talk about their feelings\". All in for free love here but your blatant disregard for women- disgusting."}
{"text":"Currently enjoying their Greek omelette.

Absolutely no gripes about the food.  
Very generous portion, well-prepared (especially for an omelette!), and wonderful flavors.
I'm really impressed by this place.  I wish I lived in Tempe so I could come back again!

Def recommended."}
{"text":"First visit for us, our order was taken quickly and brought to our table reasonable wait time. I had the hot Jaun; which was large and filling; with the potatoes. My partner has the third avenue tuna(less sprouts and more tuna please) with chips. 
Staff is friendly and polite, atmosphere is lively as expected."}
{"text":"This is one of very few breakfast options in Tempe. It has a trendy, youthful style. Our service was a little slow and our drinks were forgotten, so we received them after our food.

I had the Hot Juan omelet, which contains chorizo and green peppers and is topped with cheese and sauce. The omelet was pretty good, but nothing remarkable. I had sme excellent bites with the spicy chorizo and wish it had more. The peppers were crunchy and only moderately fresh, while the egg was much too thick. The fresh fruit that came with my meal was quite good.

I wouldn't make a point to go here, but I would stop in again if the time is right."}
{"text":"Great original pancakes and gluten free red velvet waffles. Optional seating outside. Waited quite a while for out meal but it was good food."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Surprisingly so considered it's basically quick service. The pear havarti cheese omelette is one of the best I've ever eaten. The coffee is even tasty. Great location on north mill near ASU. Lots of outdoor seating. They're always busy but line moves fast and it's worth the wait. Can't miss breakfast spot!"}

Yelp review
Breakfast and Brunch
Ncounter
310 S Mill Ave, Ste A101
Tempe, AZ 85281
(480) 968-9288

I went to Ncounter last Sunday morning with my boyfriend. Before we went, I checked reviews and pictures on the Yelp. By looking at postings, it is a traditional brunch restaurant. It serves omelets, pancakes, waffles. All foods look delicious, and we decided to go and check this highly-reviewed brunch place.
When we arrived, we saw the restaurant was full. It provided indoor and outdoor seating. We were confused first when we went in because no one seated us. I think they should put a sign on the front door so people who come at the first time will not be confuses like us. We had to see what other people do, and follow them. Customers order at the counter and find seats by yourself. Probably because it was Sunday, there were no vacancy tables. We had to wait at the bar to see if any one left. So do not go there at weekends if you could. The environment of Ncounter was pretty clean and bright which gave us a great mood on the weekend morning. There were blackboards with hand writing and drawing on the wall. I think it is fun stuff. Also, it had a long black table inside which convenience group of people to talk and eat. It is pet friendly (patio only). I love to see sweet dogs when I eat.
My boyfriend ordered a burrito and smoothie, I ordered loaded omelet and iced latte. My boyfriend loved his smoothie. It was blueberry smoothie with peanut butter. He said it was not too sweet for a drink and the flavor of blueberry was not covered by peanut butter. I am not a fun of peanut butter, so I will not comment on that smoothie. The latte I ordered was $4 or $4.5. I think it is not worth that. It was too bitter and I cannot taste the milk. I will buy Starbucks next time. The burrito and omelet were just ok. They putted too much cheese on it. We had to get rid of it before we ate. My omelet contained ham, sausage, and bacon with side of fried potato. The size was big for me, I had to take out the left. My boyfriend thought the size was not enough for man. He ate some my omelet at the end.
One thing I have to complain is the waiting time. My boyfriend and I almost waited half hour for our food after we seated. Servers perhaps took so much time to find where we were seating.  Maybe they should hire more servers at weekends. 
Moreover, Ncounter provides drink bar with coffee and different types of drinks. Besides the drinking bar, there was a table with hot sauces. It is cool that gives customers more choices and saves more time for both servers and customers. 
The location is great as well. It is located on the Mill Ave, the center of Tempe Downtown.  Also, it is beside the rail train station, which is convenient for people who don't drive."}
{"text":"The pancakes are huge for a low price. $5.50 for 3 monster cakes! The service was also very nice and the entire place had a happy atmosphere attached to it."}
{"text":"This is a cool little breakfast place on Mill. I'm really surprised this is like the only one. They have done it right. Great breakfast combo's, little bar if you want bloody mary's or mimosa's. Lots of college kids coming in to nurse their hangover. Totally dug this place, awesome place for college town. I'll TOTALLY be back."}
{"text":"Talk about a trendy spot! I fell immediately in love with this brunch/breakfast/lunch spot on Mill Ave. the service was wonderful which really surprised me because you're in a college town. I had the veggie Benedict and it met my expectations, but really should've switched the potatoes for something else."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever. Not really much else to say. Pancakes and waffles are great, so are the omelettes. Staff is always kind and the service is great. Ncounter is always our first choice for breakfast in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Good food, indoor and outdoor seating, Bellinis and Mimosas on the menu. Unfortunately, I was turned off by the claustrophobic feeling as soon as I walked in. This place had a line almost to the back of the cafe, & seating was limited so one of us had to swoop in on an empty table and sit down while the other stood in line to order. 

Once we sat down, it took forever to get our food. When it finally arrived, it wasn't what I ordered. And we had no silverware. Or condiments. So I'm waiting on my meal, my mom is sitting there trying to be patient and not eat without me. The saving grace was that my food was yummy once I received it. 

This was a Sunday morning/early afternoon, so I get that it's going to be busy. I'd like to come during the week when it isn't so crowded."}
{"text":"Second time here in two years. Really like the modern, clean style and the healthy menu. Love eggs and had my fair share there. Prepared on the mark along with my latte, can't complain about this busy place"}
{"text":"Nice new joint the wife and I checked this out recently on an early Sunday morning - aka downtown college kiddies were still sleeping so it was nice and calm. Food wasn't good but nothing amazing, handful of options, but a nice view and clean spot. Need to return because I need to understand what the \"bartender\" was tending to so early in the morning."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't like a place like this. Calculated atmosphere with a \"Hip, Trendy, Urban Feel\". It could easily come off as disingenuous, but it doesn't! The heart is here. The food is usually marvelous. The space is \"modern\" but not shallow and soulless.   

If I had to complain... the success and location brings in hoards of the more obnoxious ASU greek life types on the weekends. After you make your way through hungover bro-dogs and sorority girls, you will have a great meal."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!  If you are dropping someone off at Sky Harbor Airport, stop by for breakfast or brunch.

We had about 9 people altogether.  So, instead of having to have everyone stand at a walk up order, my Mom and I ordered what we thought they would like instead.  Here is the list:

Breakfast chorizo burrito-Must have been that good, none left to try.

Croque monsieur actually a madame, with a couple of fried eggs topped a crusty bread.  (My meal)

Eggs Bennie-I had to have a bite of this perfect hollandaise topped creation.  Will be ordering that next time.

Banana foster french toast- the two little cutie pies finished off the sweet topping confection confection of caramelized bananas and whipped cream.  The toast had enough custardy texture inside.

Strawberry and cream french toast- Same French toast as above but covered with strawberries and whipped cream.

Farmer's breakfast-eggs, multi grain toast, bacon (or sausage) and breakfast potatoes.

The coffee, fresh squeezed OJ and choco milk were all good.

Of course, we're looking forward to dining here again!!!"}
{"text":"Dogs are welcome on the patio. The cold brew is yummy, its $10+ per person, the service is great, will be coming back"}
{"text":"This is a very cute, new restaurant in a nice location. They have covered parking available and they validate it as well. I had just a basic breakfast, eggs and bacon with potatoes. The eggs tasted like they were the fake ones you purchase in a milk carton, like egg whites when you are trying to be healthy. This place was just ok for me as far as the food goes, the service was excellent. I think I had high hopes because it looks so fancy appetizing when you walk in. I would be open to try this again, but so far just a meh."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience here. A little unexpected given the size of the place and that its on Mill Ave. Husband loves the burrito and I usually get an omelet. My son loves their pancakes and fresh OJ. Their fresh baked pastries and muffins are awesome as well!"}
{"text":"The place was busy.  Still had plenty of seating outside on their patio.  Good vibe in the place, reminds me of liberty market in Gilbert.  

I had a egg sandwich called killer. This sandwich had some cheese (forgot what kind of cheese) that was really strong.  It over powered the sandwich so I didn't care for it.  

My wife had the pancakes.  Banana fosters pancakes I think.  These were really good.  I had half of her order since she never eats all of her food (lucky me;).  

We also had a body Mary.  It was a little spicy, the way I like it.   It was not to strong, which to me is good if your having one with breakfast.   

Next time we hike A-mountain,  we will stop in there to share the French toast."}
{"text":"I have to say I have been here enough now to say it is VERY VERY INCONSISTENT! 
One day the food is good, eggs done right, potatoes good not over seasoned etc.. other days, the food is blah! Greasy potatoes, eggs have no flavor, just not appetizing. So after several times of going, I think this will be the last unless a friend demands to go there. If I have to go, Ill get a bagel or muffin and some coffee, thats it. Otherwise the food is just mediocre. Needs to be consistent! You cannot have a drastic swing in food from one time to another. Every time was different for me and my wife. thats all..."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I had been wanting to try this place for the longest time, somewhat disappointed. The whole setup up was like a hyena feeding frenzy. Of course, it was Sunday (brunch), but I wasn't aware of the order at the front and wait for your food. 

Food I'd say was mediocre. I ordered the pear omelet and my friend got the morning glory. Decent serving size. I can't really go into much detail because to me it was pretty plain. Definitely not an ideal brunch. Felt too rushed and not relaxing as Sunday brunch should be. 

Tried it once, probably not going back. Didn't quite shake my taste buds."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant , good food.  Very nice location and fun food!  Walk to Tempe Beach Park , to the Mill, Metro line."}
{"text":"Two stars cause the food is good. I have been here on a few occasions and the food is delicious but the service freaking sucks. The guy behind the bar was really rude. I asked if there was a smoothie for ashley, he sarcastically responded with \"I dont know, IS there a smoothie for Ashley?\" This is your job. You get paid to smile, be nice, and take food orders. I work at a very busy and local breakfast spot here in Tempe also so I get it. You guys are slammed. Believe me, I know the feeling.. but at least act like you care. The pretentious attitude from the young girl at the counter was enough for me to never return. I gave her a twenty and she didn't bother to give me my change. I had to ask for it... after I already put money in the tip jar. Are you kidding me? Take that shit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First timers here!!! Have to say it's just as good as we thought!!! Similar to scramble and fisrtwatch somewhat but the best part was service and atmosphere!!! Wasn't super packed even on a Sunday morning and the menu had options for everyone and everything!! Portion sizes were awesome!!! Didn't get a chance to try out the bar and good morning bloody Mary's but it's a must do next time they looked great!!!   Parking is in the garage to wear you need to have them validate ticket... so don't forget!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and I love it.
As a mushroom lover, I'd have to recommend the portobellini sandwich. Mushroom-vegetable goodness in a bun."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place! They're usually very busy so the wait can be longer than expected but it's worth it! Their strawberry waffles are delicious! Also, first come first serve so as soon as you walk in, start looking for a table, have someone in your party save the table while you're in line to order food!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend visiting from out of town in March (group of about 6).  I got the Natie Bomb which is basically a twist on a traditional turkey bacon sandwich.  The sandwich and side salad were beyond my expectations for this place (which was hard to do since I already had high hopes). 

The place was a little corky and unique.  It was pretty busy so we had to sit outside.  Living in AZ, most know this can kill an experience.  NCounter had fans and misters outside so it was actually really nice.

The only downside is it took a little long for the food considering it was all pretty much sandwiches we ordered, but it was worth the wait.  I would recommend this place in a HEART BEAT!

Keep in mind when going, it is only open until 3:00 pm."}
{"text":"So, decided to choose this place for breakfast, been here before, great Bloody Mary, this time, we joined the line waited about 10 mins ( not bad).,, my GF stepped up the the cashier, with a cheery Good Morning!! to be greeted abruptly by a snappy One Minute please!, finger in the air,,, Where am I ? Grade school, it felt like a slap in the face to both of us, as she stared into the register, clacking away... we are the Customer, at least, say Good Morning back, and say I will be able to TAKE you order in a moment...we felt reprimanded, and the last time I checked we were paying for our $40 breakfast ..
Got our coffee cups, went to the self service Coffee Stand,,, little drip then nothing,so I asked one of the runway models, if there was more coffee, he pointed to the other side,, ahhaha guess what out also,,, so we decided to go sit till fresh coffee was done brewing.,.. I am surprised, someone took the time from modeling to brew a pot... 
Ok coffee ready, went back up ... Time for ? \" hot steaming coffee.... and guess what goes nto coffee?  CREAM!, guess what was empty .... HUH larious....
Jump forward to sitting out side, delish breakfast the best lavendar scone, excellent coffee, when we got cream...
Interestingly enough, no one checked back on us, was the food ok? did you need a spoon? maybe some water? is everthing good?... this was not for short of the continuous male models wait staff,  walking in a circle, thru one door walk, stop. turn to the left, walk, stop turn to the right , look in my direction , but not actually seeing me, fixes hair, flexs butt walk in thru the nx door.... 7 different guys constant circle..
Very interesting concept....but I dont think we will stop in again.... not even for those tasty scones..
Too bad,, its so easy to get to from the West Tower...sigh...."}
{"text":"Breakfast on Mill Ave takes a leap forward with NCounter. Eggs, bacon, and pancakes were solid. Jam was excellent and the service was fast. Great option for doing business in Tempe."}
{"text":"Today was race day. One would expect a place that close to the lightrail station and the race and the center of all the insanity to be a mess. But no. 
The line that went out the door disappeared almost immediately. Everyone was so nice. The food came out super fast and was, as always, the best on Mill. The guys at the bar (that look like bouncers! And Arsenal from \"Arrow\" Hi, Arsenal!)) were patient and helpful even when given so many opportunities not to be. :] 
Honestly, one of the best places to enjoy your morning."}
{"text":"I had the eggs Benedict, which may have been the best I've ever had!! I'm not normally a huge fan of potatoes, but there's are the best, I am addicted! I also had the sunrise smoothie, and it tastes a lot like a soft sherbet ice cream, so if you're into that-- go for it. 

Overall, I loved the experience! My only suggestion would be to make it less difficult to find napkins :( I had to ask a bartender for some because there were none anywhere where customers could get them."}
{"text":"The Greek Omelette was amazing! And great cold brew! Nice patio. I'll def be back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"So glad they put an Ncounter near downtown! It's a great location and I love the ambience of the place. Our door seating is necessary for Patio life lovers. My fiancé came and tried it out and for the most part it was ok. Her sandwich was really good, it was called the Romo something.... but it was so good I stole the other half of the sandwich! I'm an omelette lover so I tried the Greek and I wasn't very excited about it. The whole thing tasted really bland but there's nothing hot sauce can't fix. We will be back to try other things on the menu and maybe even some cocktails. :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice go to on Sunday morning.  Greek omelet was good.  My buddy had the scrambled eggs and the other stuff with it.  Both enjoyed it.  Would go back if the prices were a bit lower, but I think $9.29 for an omelet and toast is just a bit much.  

I saw some old people sit down and then eventually leave.  I think they didn't realize it was order off to the side, take a number, and then wait for them to bring it out to you."}
{"text":"I went to NCounter because of Yelp.

Waaay overrated in my opinion! After you order at the counter, you have to fight for a table if you have more than two people in your group. There was relatively fast turnover, but it's annoying having to cherry-pick someones table hoping they'll leave after their last bite. But, being a Saturday morning, being busy wasn't a deal breaker.

When I received my omelette, the cheese was partially melted and rather tasteless. The eggs were rubbery like something you'd get at a cheap buffet. The potatoes were OK, but didn't compensate for the rest. Overall, the portion sizes were small and the food was just mediocre. I'm not a picky breakfast person, but I would rather go to Denny's or IHOP than come back to NCounter.

If you're looking for good breakfast in Tempe (near Mill), you're not far from Harlow's, Essence Bakery, Cafe Boa or even U.S. Egg."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and smoothie. Nice and close to the marriott!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. I order my food online from Ncounter.com and pick it up 15 minutes later. A bit pricey (if you eat like I do) and the food isn't exactly healthy (seriously, everything on the menu is smothered in butter or a sugar dressing) but it tastes good and it is really one of the only breakfast places around Mill. Their pancakes and waffles are great, though I try to just stick with the eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for breakfast on Sunday after a long bike ride with friends. Always bustling with activity, lots of which are ASU students. 

I recommend going on a day that's nice enough to sit outside, the patio is great for people watching! It is a self-serve cafe so much more casual in nature than other breakfast eateries but the food is awesome for the price you pay. 3 huge, fluffy, perfect pancakes with mix-ins for $6.50. If you love pancakes as much as I do, these are some of the best. 

If you're in the 'hood and can deal with the early closing hours, I definitely recommend this place amongst the many 'drab' eateries on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"The good:

Most of the food here is quite tasty, and fresh. Mill ave definitely needed a breakfast place. The Marathoner smoothie is my favorite thing there so far. 

The customer service is great. If you don't like something, they will take it back and get you something new...even delivering it to you if you work on Mill Avenue.

The Bad:

Wait times, almost every time I have been there are outrageous. 10 minutes for a smoothie, 25 minutes for a takeout sandwich, 20 minutes when I was sitting, waiting for my food there. 

The price. I often found myself paying close to $15 for lunch... and I cannot honestly say I think the lunch I received was worth $15."}
{"text":"I really like this concept for a quick breakfast/brunch spot, but the execution wasn't too delicious. If you know me well enough, you'll know my first thought when we walked in was \"is there booze???\" The answer is yes. I recall seeing your typical breakfast bevies such as mimosas, bellinis, bloody mary's, etc.

So you go in, scope out the menu, order at the counter, and they bring you your meal and beverages. I ordered a simple eggs, potatoes, toast and sausage breakfast, and my friend had an omelette. We had just had brunch at Maizie's the day prior and our first impression was disappointment in the portions of the food, considering the prices were also comparable. Oddly, my sausage, potatoes and sunny side eggs had the same consistency, so that was off for me. They were all a bit soft and soggy. We, of course, enjoyed the mimosa and bellini, but $5 each is a bit high considering they're $3 @ at other places, and Cafe Boa down the block offers unlimited mimosas for a fixed fee with food. 

I thought the location was great, and the Sunday brunch crowd was nice. I'm not sure what it will be like when the students come back, but I don't think I would be back to find out."}
{"text":"NCOUNTER! Wow! Clean, modern styling inside and out. Indoor outdoor seating is available too. The restaurant sits kitty corner from a swath of desert landscape complete with trails.  We loved our meal here. I went with a group and we ordered Eggs Benedict, the Chipotle Egg Burrito, and the Ultimate BLT. Everyone commented that their food was great. We were there on an unusually busy weekend (Parents' Weekend at ASU) but the line to order was out the door and trying to get a table was very challenging...."}
{"text":"Genuine NYC brunch experience.  Really good menu, with unique twist.  Great services and friendly accommodating staff.  On the list for regular breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Went in with no expectations. You select your meal, drinks, tasty treats, etc. at the counter. Take your number  and find a seat. Decor is contemporary and clean looking. Plenty of patio seating. Inside seating has as many options as the menu it seems. High tops with chairs or high tops with bench and chairs. Everything was clean and neat for a Sunday midday. 

Now the food. I ordered the Huevos n Chorizo. It was cooked properly and portion was good sized. Flavor was good to great. Only negative would be that that tortilla bottom was soaked in the runoff of the chorizo. Some don't care some will. Luckily the tortillas are folded up and was very little of it was soaked. Was great plate for cost. 

Daughter ordered the waffle that was perfectly cooked. Was fluffy and light. Very tasty and again a good portion size. 

Wife had the Chipotle breakfast burrito and was big portion. Also very well cooked. 

Overall was a good to great experience and we will return to try some other items of the menu."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are a minority. Two white customers that came in were served right away. I had a to go order, and four different employees were staring at me and refused to help me while I stood at the counter from 10:04 to 10:10. Very snooty, \"you don't belong here\" vibes. Thank you for the terrible service today."}
{"text":"Thank you again Yelpers for helping me find Ncounter.  I had the Chorizo with basted eggs. OMG, it was so flavorful and perfectly balanced.  It was chorizo, potatoes and cheese on a plate, topped with two perfectly cooked eggs on top, served with a fresh tortilla.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Perfection.  I hardly ever give five stars but I can't think of one thing wrong with my eating experience.  Fast service, delicious food, fair prices, clean, option to eat outside with cooling mist.  My first eating experience in Phoenix...bar is set high. Yummy, yummy, yummy.  My husband had the burrito and he was equally happy.  Sorry, I was too busy making food noises to remember what he had in his burrito."}
{"text":"the good: the blackberry green tea is delicious, the bread and the bleu cheese was awesome. the bad: there was only about 4oz of \"thinly sliced sirloin\" with equals ROAST BEEF,  for an $11 dollar combo (ELEVEN DOLLAR COMBO)  I require more meat, and actual sirloin..also the amount of packaging involved was shameful. The cups and togo container were the ones that are non sustainable. this is mill ave people..along with a GIANT fucking bag that looked like it would be more for a shoe store, or some retail shit. Still all in all a great lunch, so close to four stars, but the staff were just bullshitting with each other and the cooks, when I see this, and my food takes about ten mins for a fucking sandwich I get mad."}
{"text":"I decided to meet my friend for lunch in Tempe as her work is right off of Mill and 3rd street. However she gives me a funky address that I type into my iphone (instead of saying, \"hey Tasia, I work on 3rd street, just off of mill) and it leads me on a wild goose chase. Alas, I finally get to the correct destination, park, and walk to meet her in the 113 degree heat (but weather.com says it *feels* like 106, ha!). She asks me where I want to go and I say \"somewhere new,\" which is easy for me because I haven't been on Mill since 2004. She is naming off food joints as we are walking South on Mill, I pull out my Yelp app and quickly type in \"lunch tempe\" and NCounter pops up. I give this suggestion, we stop walking, turn around and look at how far the walk now is (it really wasn't that far, it was just the heat) since I didn't think about this sooner. Just then, she sees a coworker and asks for recommendations and his first choice in NCounter. We look back at each other and decide to go for it.

This place is open Monday-Sunday 7am - 3pm and serves breakfast and brunch foods. The inside was very refreshing with the cold AC, open layout, and tons of tables and chairs, including one nice communal table. They also have a small patio with misters. My friend and I starred at the large menu and decided to split the Potobellini ($8) and the Peppered Italian Salad ($8.50). The Potobellini comes with portobellini mushrooms, roasted red peppers, artichoke, provolone cheese, spinach and a balsamic mayo that is piles on a delicious grilled ciabatta bread and you have a choice of a side salad or chips to accompany the sandwich. The Peppered Italian Salad comes with grilled chicken atop of sauteed cashews, red peppers, and garlic, over romaine lettuce with an Italian Parmesan dressing. The salad was tasty, but they went a little heavy on the dressing which is a total buzz kill for me. Next time I'll ask for the dressing on the side. For drinks they offer anything from alcoholic beverages (served at a smaller counter), coffee, tea, smoothies, and your traditional sodas ($2) and juices. I opted for iced tea ($2) and appreciate that they offer a freshly brewed Blackberry-Jasmine-Green Tea and a Passion Fruit iced tea.

The service was great. The employee taking our order offered up the Peppered Italian Salad suggestion and the employee delivering our food noticed we were splitting our items and brought us out a separate plate use. We also had our table top cleared pretty soon after we finished eating so we were able to enjoy our space and drinks while finishing out conversation before my friend had to go back to work.

We both agreed that the mild sunburn and heat stroke was worth it and that we both will be back!"}
{"text":"Ncounter was a great introduction to my weekend trip to Arizona! I flew into Phoenix the night prior without an itinerary but it all worked out!

I'm an early bird and they open at 7 which was perfect! 

I ordered their House Request in addition to their Banana Walnut Pancakes. Their portions are very generous! There was so much walnuts cooked into the pancakes and placed on top! The bananas weren't too sweet and it went well with the maple syrup. The House Request has cream cheese and a fried egg inside, tomatoes and onions. I don't eat red meat or poultry so it was nice they had options! The sandwich was so hardy and it wasn't too heavy. They also have a separate espresso bar.

The decor of the place was very modern. There was plenty of natural lighting and wood grain table tops. It is a self serve hybrid kind of restaurant.  

There are plenty of metered street parking. I did notice a parking structure that also may provide parking.  

Ncounter is located right on the corner. It was easy to find and there was plenty of other businesses around. Given that I had limited time to explore, I only scoped out a fraction of the area. 

There is a cool chalk board right outside that I've never seen before that allows anyone to leave a positive message for the entire day. Messages are washed away the next morning. 

Overall, I had a great experience. The food was delicious, the facilities were clean and the service was good. I would come back again on my next visit!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times and have never been disappointed. We usually sit at the bar outside so order our food there. Not only is the food delicious, but they clearly take extra steps to make it visually appealing as well. For example, the breakfast burrito is cut in half and they melt a piece of cheese onto the cut end so it appears to be oozing with goodness as it's brought out to you. The croque monsieur is also one of my favorites, served open faced with lots of delicious cheese sauce. I don't understand the bad reviews on here, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Breakfast for lunch, had the strawberry pancakes w whipped cream. Situated on the corner of Mill and close to the light rail stop, so very convenient location and walkable from ASU. Plenty of options for everyone even the non meat eaters in your party. Patio seating is available and ordering is at the counter but food is delivered to your table. Place also has a bar so u can get beer wine some cocktails."}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of this place and how modern the interior is. The food is great and servers are too. They have an outdoor patio to enjoy the weather and you can also get drinks here too. I've pretty much tried everything on the menu and its been amazing every time"}
{"text":"The food was tasty and the space was clean. Coffee was decent. I got the breakfast sandwich, tasted great. Only complaint is it is slightly on the steeper side for the portion, but that is expected with a downtown location. I would return."}
{"text":"Catering was again a flawless experience. I depend on Ncounter for catering often. They're on time, present the food well, can include serving spoons, utensils, etc. and their coffee is great. I always get compliments. 

I understand they're now using Door Dash for regular menu item deliveries and I'm looking forward to ordering a few lunches delivered when I just can't make it away from my desk.  

I always feel like a VIP."}
{"text":"I had the flu and just needed something in my stomach so I ordered delivery through Postmates, mainly because they had a strawberry smoothie that sounded good. But since it was delivery, I needed to hit the minimum order so I added the grilled cheese as an afterthought. Oh man, let me tell you! The smoothie was good and all but that grilled cheese just might be one of the best I've ever had! I did switch the 12-grain bread for sourdough but it was melty, cheesy, crispy, spicy and ooey gooey all at the same time. Very good and will certainly order from here again!"}
{"text":"This place is freggin AWESOME!!! So far I've only had an omelette, but it was so wonderfully stuffed with spinach, toms, and feta that I haven't been able to order anything else! Today's omelette isn't as GLORIOUS as last week's but I'm still crush it!"}
{"text":"This place got pretty good reviews So I picked it for Saturday brunch. I was a bit surprised by the set up which wasn't mentioned in any recent reviews so that's one of the reasons for my 4 stars. You go up to the counter to order your meal and drinks and then they're brought to you. While I understand this, I'm a little old fashioned in that I prefer a server. Regardless, the food and drinks were wonderful. I had a Screwdriver, biscuits and gravy and some kind of eggs Benedict. All was very good and filling. Honey got an omelette, a Bloody Mary and split my biscuits and gravy. We couldn't finish everything so planned on taking food home with us which leads me to the other reason for the 4 star rating. When it came time to get a to-go box, I waited for a runner to come by. 2 or 3 were back and forth while one was talking with his buddy. For 15 minutes or so, no one even looked our way. Finally, a young man came by. Overall great place though."}
{"text":"Good portions for reasonable prices. Food servings weren't so humongous like in other breakfast joints where you feel like you hate yourself after eating. It was just right. 

When you come in, you immediately go up to the counter to order. Don't feel discouraged by the long lines - it goes by quick. When you get your number, just grab a seat and they'll bring your food to you. Easy peasy. Usually takes around 10-15 mins. Love the patio during the cooler months. 

Favorites: Farmer's market benedict and bananas foster french toast. The potatoes that came with the bene were perfectly seasoned and had a crunch on the outside. The hollandaise sauce was just perfect. Bananas foster had some fluffy texas toast-sized bread that made it much more rich and decadent. 

Looking forward to trying more....or maybe just keep sticking with those two favorites, I wouldn't mind either way."}
{"text":"The food here is honestly delicious. I got the loaded omelette with a side of fruit instead of potatoes.

I would just recommend not trying to get too fancy with your order. Yesterday I came and I tried to swap out the potatoes for an egg and the toast for an egg. they messed up the order. and today my friend tried to replace cream cheese in his omelette with avocado with hollandaise sauce on the side. They forgot the avocado, left cream cheese out and hollandaise sauce on the side, like asked. And thy overlooked his omelette. He says 3 stars, but i loved my food."}
{"text":"This place surprised me....it seemed so Abercrombie and I'm more of a Ross gal, lol.  The food was tasty and there were several options to accommodate my picky pescetarian lifestyle.  Would have given it 5 but the conversation between the to-go guy and the smoothie gal enlightened me that the smoothie was not done but she would \"make it be\".  Sadly, I could taste the few last chunks of spinach, I presume, that would have been nicely blended if she just let it finish....(I should note that I've never dined in.)"}
{"text":"I ordered the crack 'o dawn, which came with two sunny side up eggs. The toast, which I normally ignore at breakfast, was good because of the compote they serve it with, maybe raspberry? I also ordered the greyhound, which was delicious and well sized. Everything here seemed reasonably priced for the portions, and I'd definitely try it again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow nice place based on first impression. Early Wednesday on the patio.  Love the Hulk."}
{"text":"Order at counter, simple breakfast menu, great food. Small space and not a lot of tables but they do have patio tables and a bar with seating. We will go back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelming.  It looked good from the website so as new-to-towners we thought we would check it out. 

First - you place your order at a counter all the way in the back of the restaurant and then pick a seat and they bring your food to you. 

The line situation is a little bit confusing because they have \"order here\" and \"to go orders\" right next to each other behind a  stanchion so you get the awkward \"I was standing in line here\" when people who are \"regulars\" zip up to the line and then try to cut the line of five or so who formed a line behind the register assuming that to stand horizontally along the counter would imply they were \"to go\" orders 

When you order your food and drink you are told it will be brought to you but if you want cream or sugar in your coffee they tell you that it's at the beverage counter (so you have to go back inside after being seated to get the coffee the way you asked at the counter)

Our food came to us cold so that was disappointing. I ordered the vegetarian eggs Benedict (I think it's called a farmers Benedict on the menu) and literally nothing on the plate was warm. 

It probably would have been good."}
{"text":"theres a wait to order but its not too bad.. self seating..

the sweet breakfast dishes are super big on portions, but the savory breakfast dishes are a lot smaller.

environment is pretty loud so talking with my friends was a little difficult lol
i tried the one of the eggs benedict  dish with spinach, which was pretty good but i think they can do better on the amount of potato cubes -____-

we also got the banana french toast, super big, super sweet AND it was drenched in syrup with a SIDE of syrup haha

definitely will be coming back to try the other options the next time I come back to AZ!"}
{"text":"Not sure how Ncounter could possibly have less than 4 stars, but definitely deserves more attention. The location is new, but Ncounter is a staple in downtown Tempe and arguably the best brunch in town! Scottsdale has a lot to learn here. I snag the loaded omelette or chipotle egg burrito almost every time and it never disappoints. I even bring my guests here first before anywhere else and there's no comparison. I'm actually about to bring my partner with me shortly so we can chow down again! Don't second guess it!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and brunch options. I came around 11 AM on a Saturday and it was packed. The menu offered typical brunch options but everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious. My eggs were flavorful and delivered to my table in about 10 minutes. They atmosphere was energetic and feels kind of hipster but not overly so."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I have to write this place a poor review . A year ago it would of been 5 stars . But now seems like they just don't put the same effort out there anymore . Service is great . Great atmosphere !! Well let me get straight to the point . Whoever is the cook at times just cooks poorly at times . Where I don't even want to eat the food . Omelette taste old and the potatoes taste like they was made a few days ago . Come on guys . Tighten up a lil bit ."}
{"text":"The blueberry muffin is to die for! Best ever. This is definitely a gem and a must to visit."}
{"text":"I have high expectations for weekend breakfasts. I want them to be relaxing and leisurely, first of all. This place was neither of those. There were a TON of people swarming the place so the atmosphere was really frenetic and all the servers seemed annoyed and frazzled. I realize why they want you to order at the front--because if they served you like a regular place, they'd have to take off the cost of things on your bill because they messed up. So, yeah, you order at the counter and wait. And wait. And wait. We saw multiple tables get their food before us. We waited literally a half hour. We asked what was up and they said our order was lost somehow. Eyeroll. Thankfully, they got it out quickly after that, without utensils. I went to get some and found the utensil holder empty. The waitress said the forks were coming. Some kind of dishwasher delay. Uh, what kind of restaurant doesn't have forks? So then my food got cold. Worst of all, because I was so starving by the time I got to eat, the serving size didn't do it for me. It's not generous at all. It's like those gourmet places with tiny portions. I left hungry."}
{"text":"Food looks better than it is. Not impressed, especially with the more complicated dishes like eggs Benedict which had poor poached eggs.

Banana foster french toast was pretty good, if I had to come back I would get it.

Bacon was crappy and killer breakfast sandwich was crap."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. The food is good but the layout for ordering is awkward and the register staff seem to struggle.  Food service is a bit slow even for simple items like salad and sammies."}
{"text":"I love the service and atmosphere at NCounter, just not a huge fan of anything on the menu besides crazy sweet pancakes which I can't always eat in the morning. I prefer to go to smaller more quaint breakfast places but this is a fun place to go with friends in the morning and is close to campus."}
{"text":"Stopped in after morning jog at A mountain, seemed like the whole place was run by a bunch of block head frat boys. Omelette was pretty good, coffee pretty good, guy running the register was a  deutche. Probably won't be heading back but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Trendy, noisy, bright place, with lots of energy.  Came on a Saturday morning, and the place was hopping.  Good service crew, that gets the job done, cleans up and turns over the tables quickly.  You order at the counter, and they bring your food to you.  My wife had the Farm Market with only veggies.  She enjoyed the hollandaise sauce.  I had the Huevos and Chorizo, which was very good.  Not spectacular, but very good.  Portions are not huge, but reasonable size.  Our friend had the Bananas Foster, that looked really good."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for our meal, reviews were good, restaurant was full. The person who took out order was irritated to start, not sure why... I guess because they were busy. Then we waited for 45 minutes for our food. I asked a couple of times and was told they were slammed. The guy's next to us got their food in 15 minutes. When ours finally came (2 fried eggs and potatoes) it had two long dark haired in it... Not either of our hair. Ugh...I was super hungry. 

I have it back and we asked for a refund. He did come over and refunded us both which was nice but never an acknowledgement of any poor service..Anything. sorry... Never again"}
{"text":"Keep in mind, you're on Mill Ave - ASU college kid central. The staff reflects this. A bit flighty, some were really nice, though. One guy cleared and rearranged the tables and moved the umbrella so my friend and I could sit in the sun. We didn't get napkins or silverware with the food. I thought that was a bit silly. We had to hunt down the stuff ourselves, despite the fact there seemed to be tons of employees running around. The line was long and despite the large area - indoor and outdoor seating, including a breakfast bar - if you hit it at a hot time, you will have to wait in the cramped space. Claustrophobics beware! 

Now for the food. Pretty decent spicy bloody mary, definitely had a good kick to it. I'm a bloody mary fan and for $5 you can't go wrong. As a vegetarian, I was worried the options would be sparse. Not true. I had the vegetarian eggs benedict! They rocked! Never saw anything like that on any brunch/breakfast menus - and I get around. It was exactly what I wanted. Two English muffins, runny eggs (I like using the potatoes to soak up the yolks), fresh spinach, avocado and tomato slices and the right amount of Hollandaise. Wow. The potatoes were tasty - just needed a dash of salt, although I'm a salt hound. My friend had the coffee which he said was ok (but I can't judge for myself, sorry) and he had a more traditional breakfast of eggs, potatoes and bacon. He enjoyed it, though you'd really have to try and screw that one up. All in all the food was yummy and the location is great. Perfect when the weather is nice to sit outside and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dude, awesome! The food is amazing and the staff is on point. They were very friendly and easy to have a conversation with. All in all my meal was delicious, I had the Santa Fe, and my friends enjoyed their meal too. The food wasn't too expensive either. This is probably our new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place out for a while since it's down the street from where I live. I finally came here this past weekend with my sisters and I must say I wasn't too disappointed.

I had the Farmer's Market, which was an Egg Benedict, topped with a poached egg, avocado, tomato, spinach and of course the hollandaise sauce, plus a side of potatoes. I thought that it was good the only thing I didn't like was that my meal was drenched in the hollandaise sauce. It was just too much for me.

My sister ordered the French Toast with Whipped Cream and Strawberries and BOYYYYYYY did it look & tasted AMAZING! 

If anyone is around the Mill Ave area, you should definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is cute. Has a patio that dogs are allowed.  The food is delicious. But once you get the original chop salad...its hard to get anything else.  The creamy pesto dressing is one to crave! Yummyyyyy"}
{"text":"We ordered the Eggs Benedict and The Killer. The Benedict was cooked to perfection, and the Killer had great bold flavor. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best brunch places in the area. There's a lot of variety for breakfast and lunch food items. The coffee and mimosas are delicious. And the music is always on point. I'm always excited to go."}
{"text":"Food was pretty bland, had to add a lot of hot sauce. It was uncomfortably hot in the restaurant because they had the garage door open to the patio. Saw on their thermostat that it was set to 85 degrees, which is unacceptable in my opinion. The servers were not very friendly, I'm sure they were just uncomfortably hot too. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Sooooooo much promise but such crappy service.  Rude staff, food is decent  but the staff thinks they're too cool for school.  Went for brunch with the hubby, had the French toast, he the chipotle burrito...mine was cold like ice cold.  Brought me new one and was still cold."}
{"text":"Tried Ncounter for the first time today for lunch. While they have breakfast and lunch items I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat but decided a sandwich. I really enjoyed the ceddar dip sandwich w/a side of chips. While they were pretty busy for a Friday lunch we didn't have to wait to long for our order. I am looking forward to coming back and trying many more things on the menu."}
{"text":"They make a damn good grilled cheese!  How can you hate bacon, tomato, jalapeño and I don't know how many different  cheeses? It could have been grilled a bit more to make the bread more crunchy.   They have a nice patio area, a coffee/smoothie bar, baked goods, and the breakfast coming to the other tables looked YUMMY!"}
{"text":"The Hulk Smoothie was a nice green spinach based refreshment that seemed nice before a little bike up the next door hill.... it was a much and not too sweet drink. $6.49 after tax isn't too bad for price as far as this area goes. 

It seemed like this is a breakfast spot with Sone sandwiches for lunch too. From the name I wasn't sure what it was, but I'm pleased I stopped in...

Stop in for a treat..."}
{"text":"Ok, 3rd visit and no omelet today.  I had a breakfast sandwich. .  Just ok.  I still like the food and it was soooooooo busy this am.  Lots of activity!  I am on a mission now to visit here til I have tried the whole menu!!!!  3 down many many more to go."}
{"text":"I've been going to NCounter for over a year now, and use it primarily for quick breakfasts that get to include my dog on their patio!  

It has become a very popular breakfast spot for weekday mornings, especially for vegetarians and secret drinkers. 

I love it as a neighborhood spot, but don't necessarily think one should go out of their way to go here.  It has a great location diagonal from the A mountain and literally across the street from the 3rd/Mill LightRail stop. There is decent parking around and plenty of bike racks outside. 

The patio is nice, with misters that are hit or miss, sometimes not on, sometimes too wet and you end up in a wet t-shirt contest, and totally kid and dog friendly. 

It is counter service, but they do have runners that bring out their drinks and food, so have a person stake out a prime table while everyone places their orders inside.  I've never had much of a wait for for food, and they always bring out cocktails fast.

Their food is solid, the Farmhouse Benedict is perfect, they have some great bfest sandwiches, their french toast is super sweet, they don't have waffles which is a bummer, but their portions are generous.  Their b-fest cocktails are around $5 and actually a better deal than just buying juice- honestly!

I would say their downfall is coffee- it is terrible. Really terrible. I have to bring my own coffee when I come here, it is really that undrinkable. They don't have any bfest specials so if you come here often enough (and don't eat meat) you tend to get stuck in ruts, so that would be rad to see. Their misters situation can be really unpleasant. Their pastries never really look that appealing- I'm not sure if it is presentation, or what.  Their coffee/tea station is super annoying- you are supposed to grab your own silverware, napkins, drinks, ketchup, hot sauce, sugar, etc.  It is super annoying and a lot of the goods are high up!  While the food comes fast, don't expect clean up to be fast at all.  The runners really slack on cleaning up the tables and so I often have to move my dirty plate to another table to get it out of my face.

Despite these annoyances, I love their friendliness to dogs as my MaltiPoo Chloe likes hanging out here and they always offer fresh, cold water to her. The restaurant is super sclean and they have hosted the Bike to Work free b-fest, which was super awesome and supportive.

This is a solid joint appropriate for a wide range of b-festers."}
{"text":"HUGE let down! The food was nothing special, and the eggs on my eggs benedict were way over cooked. The people that think this place is great are the same people I say there wearing skull caps, and bennies as it was 106 degrees out.

Even the set up of this place was horrible! It was way to crowded with table, and it was hard to even walk around. The tables outside are bolted down and so are the seats, so unless you are the size of 6th grader prepare to be uncomfortable. 

I get that the metal seats and table look trendy and cool, but it is Arizona and when I can't even touch the table and it is hard to sit....you have made a mistake!

The menu is nothing special and if it wasn't for the drinks they offer this would be a one star place.

If you want to be go some place that looks fancy but fails to deliver then go check it out."}
{"text":"I honestly have to say, the food is absolutely magnificent, really good and unique and the atmosphere is really pleasent... if you have an hour to spend. Every occasion I've eaten here has seen me wait 30+ minutes, even get close to an hour, even though, everytime, I was one of only five or six patrons in the establishment. I understand you food is great, and that takes time, but it doesn't take 45 min to make a grilled cheese. In fact, I'm writing this as I still wait for food, and can see employees just hanging around in the back. I've worked in a restaurant so I understand the importance of quick service and urgency and there isn't any. The servers are incredible nice and I do enjoy eating here, but it can be unbearably slow at times."}
{"text":"the breakfast we had deserved 5 stars! my bananas foster french toast was dreamy. it was so light and tasty, with a little crispy on the edges. even tasted what seemed like a hint of nutmeg? damn it was good!
my wife got an omelet and said she was happy with it. 
for my beverage, i treated myself to a spicy bloody mary. it went down too easily. although i didn't really taste any alcohol, when we got up to leave, i got a little buzz on.

the place was packed on a saturday around 11am-ish. full of ASU kids and what looked like alumni. the interior is clean and bright but it is a bit congested as if they're attempting to pack as many people in as possible. there's a nice patio with misters which is where we chose to sit. 

you order at the counter and then they do the thing where you put a sort of \"marker\" thing on your table and then the servers bring out your food. personally, when i see this, i'm skeptical because i see alot of servers just kind of wandering around with plates of food looking for the customers. which is what happened to us. after a 15 minute wait, i went up to the counter and apparently they couldn't find us so we didn't get our breakfast. 

i whined a little and the manager (i think) came out, sincerely apologized and comp'd us another bloody mary. our food was out in the next 3 minutes. i appreciated his business practice. 

i hope we get to try this place again because alot of their items looked super tasty. hopefully we won't have to wait as long though!"}
{"text":"I am no expert on places around this area (right on Mill Avenue) but this is a really great breakfast/brunch place! My friend took me here when I was visiting and they have a varied menu so finding something that suits everyone should be pretty easy. I am a brunch lover so it really wasn't hard to fall in love with the place, it is a very causal ambiance and overall great experience (at least I had nothing to complain at as a visitor)! 

As a New Yorker there is few places seat you outside, the outdoor seating might therefore be my favorite part. Over all it is an excellent place for breakfast/brunch, I wish I could just work my way though their menu."}
{"text":"Cool spot on Mill with excellent food. I've had the Eggs Benedict before, but this time I tried the Chipotle Egg Burrito and it hit the spot. Great vibe and awesome staff, definitely a well managed restaurant!"}
{"text":"A very good college town greasy diner restaurant.   Not great but very good.  I enjoyed trying some. Re things and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome! Had breakfest there on a Sunday morning.  Place was a little busy but the food was really good.  I had the banana/walnut pacakes, my wife had the french toast and my 3 year old sun had the mickey mouse pancakes off the kids menu.  Everything was delicuous! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Love the restaurant won't be back parking garage states under 1 hr free parking. Went to pull out. Had to pay. The lady when they finally answered stated it was the restaurants problem. Even though there is a button for problems she wouldn't do anything about it. Sorry Phoenix I will stay in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just like their counterparts-I believe the potatoes are frozen from the bag.  Gross.  Also the whole setup is a little confusing-being that it's counter service-it doesn't seem that it's laid out very well."}
{"text":"Ommgggg today was the first day I had ever came to Ncounter and omg I was sleeping big time they are always busy and very close to my house and driving down mill I decided to go on my lunch break to get some to go and I ordered the chopped salad, its colorful and I def looks as good as it tastes it is amazing, some people may think $10.25 is high for salad and i agree it is somewhat pricey but Its truly worth it you get a little bit of everything I would suggest asking for it on a bed of kale or romaine lettuce if your a big leaf eater like me because the arugula amount is not much and I love lettuce so I had to get a side but I forsure will be backprobably tomorrow"}
{"text":"The brunch place of Mill
Ncounter is a cute place with exceptional food
The menu is very healthy, which sort of makes it stick out from the other Mill Avenue breakfast/lunch options
On my last visit I got the breakfast special which was biscuits & gravy
I love biscuits & gravy and Ncounter made them pretty good
I usually get the almost fried \"Farmers Choice\" which is pretty good for us carnivores
The coffee and cappuccino's are yummy as well
They also serve some adult brunch beverages which I like

The line can be long some days but it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"Love this place. Informal style you order at a register and they deliver it to your table - so you're getting high quality brunch but saving a few bucks. Everything is great. I loved my omelette. Bloody Mary's are great here too."}
{"text":"Food was great. You don't get a waitress. You order &PAY at the counter before you get your food. And then you get your own drink. Which is why I thought It was odd that they give the option to tip when you pay....before I get the opportunity to taste the food or know the friendly service. Seemed a bit backwards. But aside from that everything was great."}
{"text":"Waiting 45 minutes + for order.  Think they need a bigger kitchen.   

Still waiting...


Still waiting............"}
{"text":"The breakfast here in Tempe was my Saturday spot but unfortunately I am now living in Cali but if your ever in the area try their French toast, desserts and their coffee."}
{"text":"Cute concept, fast-casual breakfast place...sort of like Panera where you order and they bring your food to your table. Seating was tricky since the place was PACKED late Saturday morning. My breakfast burrito was good, and my husbands eggs benedict was great as well."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the knock is their service. I got there and I didn't know where to stand apparently I wasn't in the area of the line so the counter guy didn't even acknowledge me. Instead he was waving at some 19 year olds he wasn't gonna get with anyway.
Lets be honest.

So I ask him if this is where I stand or do I go over there? He seemed to get visibly upset like his Aspergers flared up.

I thought I would wait for my food there, but he said \"ah you might wanna grab this\" very smart alecy possibly still burnt from my simple question. 

Walked to the bathroom after my meal, there was a dude in the toilet. They have sliding glass doors to the bathroom and I had to wait relatively close to the toilet, Low and behold the guy finally gets out and it's one of the cooks. I didn't hear the sink run.

Overall I thought the food was good, I could of dealt less with the spoiled attitude of student staff."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts we've had. So many different and creative selections served quickly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is great and my office frequently orders from here for our first Friday meeting. However, I urge you to DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ORDER if you're getting it to go. Every time I have ordered from here there was been something wrong with my order. I've worked in the service industry before so I never leave a restaurant without double checking my order. However, employees should be checking it first to make sure it matches the ticket. 
Today I had ordered the portobellini for a coworker who is vegan and I specified that it was to be prepared with no cheese and no mayo, the ticket even matched said request. However, the sandwich still had mayo and cheese on it. This is not a huge ask, as it is 12pm on Friday and it's NOT BUSY. I expect a higher level of customer service than this when a restaurant isn't slammed. Management, please urger your \"servers\" to check tickets against orders!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying breakfast is my favorite meal. I could eat eggs all day long. Though that wouldn't be too healthy. I like almost all breakfast places, but was not all that impressed with Ncounter. I feel like I really could have liked it if I had ordered something else though!

It was pretty busy there, so that seemed like a good sign. We also got our food fast which was good. I got a Mimosa and the Farmer's Choice Eggs Benedict. Being the clumsy individual I am, I spilled 1/4 of my mimosa within seconds of getting it. Napkins were MIA for some reason. Then I finally found them in an unexpected place. Then could not find a trash can anywhere. That fiasco aside, the food was kind of gross. Usually I pretty much inhale all my food within minutes, but it was not that way with my eggs benedict and I was sad! It was just very soggy. So much hollandaise sauce that it masked the flavor of everything else on the english muffin.

I would be open to giving it a second try, but I was not too happy with my first experience here."}
{"text":"Very busy place, which is a great sign! My hubby had the Bananas Foster French Toast which he loved and I had the Simple breakfast with scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast. I loved the potatoes and they also provided butter and jelly on my plate without having to ask! I loved that. We will visit again soon."}
{"text":"It was ok. I personally like table served breakfast rather than ordering and getting it yourself. I did like the location, Mill ave will always be one of my favorite spots in Tempe. I was just not impressed with the food it was only OK."}
{"text":"First time to this place while traveling for business. They had great red velvet waffles, several great sandwiches including the Roma chicken, Natie and Cobb. Fun and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Do you want an amazing meal AND feel like you're stepping onto a CW soundstage? Then this place is for you. Chock full of flavor, fresh food & lots of beautiful people. The bananas foster French toast is just - just - words just cannot do it justice.  I also shared their croque monsieur and would recommend that to anyone with a mouth.  Side note, I feel like the hours this place is open corresponds nicely to the hours I'm comfortable hanging out on Mill Ave (that's another story all together).  I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I personally would have given this place three stars but the yelp scale seems to say that means \"okay\", and when I give three stars I mean \"edible.\"

The people at the cash register were really nice, it's got a good vibe, they've got delicious passion iced tea, the food came out quickly, it's right by the light rail, it's got big windows which was great for people watching (and keeping an eye on my bike outside), and the set up was nice. I found their service concept a little weird (you order at the counter, they give you a red thing with a letter on it, you stick it on the table, get your own drink, sit down, the food is delivered [fine] but it gets weird when it's almost like service starts then - someone asked if I wanted my drink refilled. Not BAD, I just found the concept...strange.)

But the reason I'm only giving it two stars is the food. \"Fresh\" is in their slogan but the food wasn't. I got the Natibomb (I think that's what it was called) at the recommendation of the guy at the counter (that's another thing - everyone there was uncommonly attractive. Again, not a bad thing, but it was noticeable that they want their servicepeople to essentially be eyecandy... just without the skimpy clothes.) Anyway. The natibomb. It has apple and turkey and bacon and cheese, all things I like, all things that can be done in a way that is both indulgent (mmm bacon, turkey, cheese) but refreshing (fresh, crispy toasted bread, nice big bites of apple.) Instead the bread was soggy with butter, the cheese was bright orange (come on, real cheddar is DELICIOUS! Don't give me bright orange!), the turkey didn't stand out, the bacon tasted pretty cheap, and the whole thing was really greasy. Like, had to drink my (very delicious) passion tea to wash the grease down greasy. The apple seemed really out of place and didn't cut down on the grease at all. My salad was kind of overdressed, too, but not horrible. 

Which is fine. If you like that kind of food, I think you'll like it there. But greasy food just isn't my taste. If you want a non-greasy yummy sandwich, try Essence Bakery on University & Hardy (they also have fantastic macarons) or The Center Bistro just up the street from Ncounter on 6th & Mill behind the brickyard. Both have local ingredients, too, which is a niche Ncounter isn't going for. 

(As an aside, another thing that was strange was how many customer service people were there. There had to be at least 7 FOH staff walking around and while the restaurant isn't small, for something that isn't even full service dining, it seemed really overstaffed. But whatever works for them!)"}

Ncounter is a nice hip place sprouted right on the north side of Mill Ave.  Brunch and Breakfast with a shot of mimosas and bellinis!  Yum!

Order like a fast food joint and seated like a restaurant.  Not sure how I like that.  Sitting at the bar is not a bad idea either to get away from the crowd...or into it I should say.  The layout of the restaurant is a tad bit odd.  When it's busy with lines you kind of line up back to back with patrons at the bar and people sitting around!  Guess you must love thy neighbor here -- wink!

I ordered the Chipotle Egg Burrito.  Presentation is a plus here!  First thought to me was there was a lot of cheese!  I'm not a cheese fan, but if you are this is your type of burrito.  With bacon, avocado, potatoes, cilantro, eggs, and a chipotle sauce it seems overwhelming, but it works.  However, I'm a texture guy and everything seems to be a one big mush for me.  If they added some crunch I think this burrito would be out of this world (tortilla chips?)  

In the end, the place is packing with students and hipsters.  Very crowded and loud if you don't mind it's pretty cool.  Outdoor seating is nice and the food is A-Okay in my book! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the concept, the food, the coffee, the atmosphere, the location. It all just works. 

You go up the the counter at the back, you order and pay for your food, they give you a card, the food gets delivered to you, you eat and you leave. There's a person who even cleans up your mess. It's simple, it's easy, it's fast and the food is just as good if not better than other sit down restaurants.

I always get the chorizo scramble thing with eggs and potatos and tortilla on the side. It's ridiculously good. It's great hang over food. They have other healthy stuff too. And booze! They've got mimosas and bloody marys. It's great."}
{"text":"I've been to the 10 P restaurant multiple times and the food has always been great. This is my first time at the downtown Phoenix location and I messed up my order. Even though it was my fault, they fixed it, no questions asked. The ambience is great the location is really nice. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast for three an hour ago, still waiting....They were busy when we got here, so we bussed our own table.  Not so busy for past 30 minutes.  Thinking about leaving."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast meetings as the food is always good and the service is prompt. 

This is my default for Tempe morning meetings."}
{"text":"I was very excited to learn that the owners of TC Eggingtons in Mesa, AZ were opening another restaurant and this time in Tempe. I went to high school and college with the owner's daughter so I know the family and how great they are. The same love and passion that they put into their restaurant in Mesa, which has more of a country feel to it, they've put into this very modern and edgy spin on breakfast and lunch. 

The first time I came was opening weekend for breakfast. After getting a feel for the restaurant we realized that you order up front and then take your order number and find a seat. We elected to sit at their coffee/booze bar and ordered Blood Marys while we waited for our food. The Bloody Marys were awesome with just enough spice to give them a kick, and the perfect amount of alcohol. When our food was ready, which literally only took 10 to 15 minutes to come out despite it being packed, they brought it out to us. I went with a chipoltle breakfast burrito and it was absolutely delicious. I felt it was a little on the small side because when I was finished I still wanted more. My girlfriend went with an omelet and it was just as delicious.

My next visit was to try their lunch and while good it didn't have the same wow factor that my breakfast did. I had ordered the Turkey and Avocado sandwich,  can't remember the exact name of it, and it was good. It tasted exactly like a sandwich I would make for myself at home. It was on regular 12 grain bread, had turkey, avocado, lettuce, and tomato on it. Very simple sandwich and it tasted that way. I was hoping to get an iced latte as well, however all they have is milk and soy milk. I've come to really love my iced latte's and mocha's with almond milk as a substitute. I don't take in dairy and as a male I try to avoid soy so my options are limited. Vanilla Almond milk really takes an iced latte/mocha to an all new level. I decided to go with the unsweetened jasmine green tea and it was some of the best tea I've ever had. Despite my disappointment in their lunch and lack of non-dairy options I will definitely be back to NCounter."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around. Gotta try the chipotle breakfast burrito and farmers Benedict!"}
{"text":"Seriously not impressed.  3 of us went all ordered different items and it was mediocre at best. I was the only one who liked the flavor of  my meal and everyone's food was cold and unimpressive. 

It took at least 20 minutes to get our meals. And it a counter order joint so u expect a bit of a speedier delivery epically  for breakfast. Idk how servers make tips or money here but that could be why it was slow idk. 

The coffee bar only had milk to offer no cream and I have a hard time with pump pots being used for dairy products....those inside parts don't come apart and there is no way they are ever 100% clean of dairy residue. Coming from a veteran of food and beverage....I would steer clear of that and ask for milk or cream on the side.

My chai tea was fantastic but it took almost 10 mins to get. I was also impressed that when I told them I didn't like melon they brought me out pineapple and strawberries  with no hesitation.  

Items ordered:
Morning  glory - the enjoyed meal 
Keep it simple - all items were cold and the potatoes were mushy.
French toast- huge portion but lacked flavor and creativity 

It's a cute spot and I'd stop in for a coffee but would probably skip the food."}
{"text":"After two hours of sleep and a flight from Chicago back to Arizona, I was very hungry and wanted breakfast within a 5 miles radius of the airport. I found this place off of Mill St, right by a Valley Metro stop. 

The interior is a mix of IKEA and Chipotle. You order at the counter, get a metal letter placard for your table so the staff can bring out your food, and you fill your own drinks. I don't mind that at all; but it seemed like 75% of the college students coming in were confused about the concept. They would huddle around the registers looking at the menu brochures, look up bewildered at the menu on the upper wall, and then look down at their brochures again. The workers would get frustrated by this and ask over and over, \"I can take someone's order here when they are ready\" to get these kids moving. 

Anyway, that's not a point against the restaurant at all--just warning you what to expect.

I ordered the strawberry pancakes and grilled potatoes. I wolfed down as much as I could--everything tasted fresh, and you can tell the potatoes weren't frozen. I didn't find anything bland--the pancakes didn't need any zest to them.The prices are a little on the higher end compared to a diner, but you are getting really good, really fresh food; not frozen, unpredictable crud from a Denny's."}
{"text":"Cool place to grab a quick meal on Mill Ave.  My dagwood sandwich was very large and tasted great!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast here yesterday. The GF had the eggs benedict, and I had the Santa Fe saute. She really liked her meal, stating she loved the hollandaise sauce. My dish was really good and very flavorful. The system here is similar to Panera, where you order at the counter, they give you a number and you grab a table. We made use of their excellent patio. Would be more than willing to return to try lunch."}
{"text":"Totally solid food. Not sit down (you order at a counter) but they have a bar and a great menu selection. When we went the line was out the door, but moved surprisingly well. They have a very well-oiled machine.

We got the meaty omelette and eggs Benedict, plus a Bloody Mary ($5, so should have gotten 2!) We liked my omelette better than the eggs bene, but both totally good.

All in all, a welcome change from the many bars, bars, oh my god we are a college town bars everywhere feeling of Tempe."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for brunch.  I loved \"the hulk\" green juice, Croque Monseiur Eggs Benedict and Hot Juan (runny egg yolks, breakfast potatoes and chorizo are a glorious combo).  It's a nice brunch spot with indoor and outdoor seating on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Not bad, average food. They do not advertise free range or cage free eggs, organic, etc but the prices are high for serving less expensive food. Have to say the service was good and their coffee cake was very good...better than Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is always amazing and the staff is always very friendly! The French toast is one of my favorites. 

There was one time when my pancakes come out undercooked. I told the busboy who promptly took them away and got a new short stack cooking for me. They brought me a cinnamon roll to snack on while I waited. This is the only \"bad\" experience I've ever had and it doesn't even qualify as bad, as they took care of me. 

The patio is also dog friendly"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing.  Had a great breakfast options and amazing service!   I was out of town visiting family and found this place and was super impressed by the service and food.   

The manager Taylor is great to, he visits with customers and make sure everyone is doing fine and enjoying their food.   

I highly recommend this place is you want great food for breakfast and lunch any day of the week.   You will be happy to go here!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews. I'm pretty picky with food and everything we had was delicious. 

Service was friendly and the order process was simple. 

I'm glad we gave this place a chance even after reading the negative reviews. 

PS I've only heard good things about this location from friends and famy."}
{"text":"Good stuff! The size of the restaurant feels a little small when the place is busy, but the fast-casual ordering style makes the place move real quick. 

I don't remember exactly what I ordered, but it was a sandwich of some sort. I would probably order something else as the bread was a little rough, but overall the experience was a good time and I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Wow. Just exactly what you want in a breakfast place.

Downtown

Quick

Easy

Good People Watching"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've visited Phoenix twice and I've made it a must to come here for breakfast. They have a great selection of food for everyone. It's gets very busy in the mornings, but the wait is worth the service and the food. Their French toast is not soggy at all and their waffles are fluffy like pancakes. Their eggs are not over cooked, and their bacon is a little on the greasy side, but they are delicious. There is sully alway room on the patio if it's packed inside. I wish the coffee was better , but their niche is breakfast."}
{"text":"Good food. Everything else about this place feels like work. If you like disorganized chaos & the excitement of not knowing what's going to happen at breakfast, you have got to try this place on a Sat/Sun morning"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for breakfast/brunch options around town, so when I heard that NCounter had recently opened, I checked out their menu online and I was sold; I knew I had to go try it out.  It looks like 16 or so others beat me to the FTR and they've only been open for a week, so I guess there were plenty of other people excited about this new restaurant opening as well.

I'm being very honest in giving a three star \"A-OK\" review, but I'm optimistic that after another visit or two, I'll be bumping it up.  The first thing I noticed is that NCounter is located in a very convenient corner location off of Mill and 3rd St (right off the light rail).  Next off, their hours: 7am - 3:05pm daily.  Interesting!  Upon walking in, I was greeted by a bunch of friendly servers...

I love the fast-casual concept where you order at the counter (hence the name, I suppose) and then get your drink(s) on your own but then your food is brought to you... I was torn as I looked at the menu as there were a handful of items that sounded good to me.  My internal dialogue went something like this:

\"Mmmmm... smoothies!\"

\"Oh wow - they serve espresso and amazing sounding coffee drinks too - very impressive but I'll skip those today since I'm avoiding caffeine while being prego.\"

\"Bloody Marys, Mimosas, Screwdrivers, Greyhounds, and more...\" I'm for sure coming back for one of those after this baby comes!\"

\"OK - back to the food menu... those wheat germ granola pancakes sound like they'd be right up my alley!\"

\"But maybe I should just go for an omelette?\"

\"That bakery case looks pretty damn appealing too with cake pops, muffins, pastries, and more...\"

After much of the above debating, I decided to order a fresh squeezed OJ and a Greek Omelette with egg whites and no onions.  For my side, I went with whole grain toast.  I grabbed my OJ and an iced water and found a table... and despite the restaurant being packed, our food arrived within 10 minutes.  

Here's where my constructive criticism comes in for NCounter: 
-A couple of onions got thrown in there, but that's forgiveable.  
-I suggest toasting the bread a bit more if you're going to call it toast; mine was not toasted!
-The verbiage that is listed with the Omelettes on the menu says \"with your choice of toast, potatoes, fruit, cottage cheese or tomatoes.\"  So I assumed my omelette would come with my choice of one of those things.  It actually came with potatoes as well as the toast I asked for, which was a bonus, but I would've prefered to order toast and fruit or toast and cottage cheese!
-The artichokes on the omelette were cold but the rest of the omelette was hot - just kind of a weird combo with each bite.

Aside from the above complaints, my food was good and considering they've only been open a week, I had a very positive first experience here.  Overall, this place is awesome and a welcome addition to the hood!  I can't wait to go back soon and try those pancakes... or perhaps a smoothie?!"}
{"text":"Quick, kinda trying-to-be-cool breakfast and lunch place.
I had the killer breakfast sandwich- I thought the Gorgonzola cheese sounded fun but honestly it didn't taste very good and I would not order it again. Potatoes were meh.
I enjoyed the bite I tried of the natie bomb lunch sandwich more. 
Cool fact about this place is they have cartel coffee, espresso and cold brew. I love cartel cold brew. The brewed passion tea was also delicious. 
Mimosa was made with fresh oj and was great size. Screwdriver is also huge and gets two hair-of-the-dog thumbs up. 
You order at the front and pick a table. If you want more drinks you have to go back up to the bar get make another purchase. 
In summary the 3 stars I devoted to Ncounter are awarded for the beverage game, which was strong. Not my favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Decided on the Ncounter Omelet, so good and gluten free!   Next time going all in for the Red Velvet Waffles.

There were lots of options for gluten free salads as well.  I was in desperate need for a breakfast/brunch menu that offers a variety gluten free options.  Very excited."}
{"text":"We love Ncounter... the kids love their Mickey mouse pancakes. The portions are great and we love the location."}
{"text":"Visited on a busy Sunday morning.  The line was out the door.  Awesome location and easy to find parking.  It took us about 20 minutes to find a table.  

You order chipotle style - order and then find a place to sit.  The staff wasn't very friendly when I was asking about popular menu items.  Seemed as though they were more focused about moving people in and out.

Although the staff didn't start me off right, the food was extremely good.  I had the breakfast burrito.  It came out with a spinach salad that had a really good dressing - a unique add on to a breakfasts burrito.  The burrito was phenomenal.  Eggs were perfectly cooked and the entree didn't require any sprucing up with hot sauce or salt etc.  My wife and mom had the farmers Benadict.  The plate was exceptional with extremely fresh and flavorful ingredients.  Three items with drinks and I got out if there just a hair over $30.  

Cheap date with great food and so so service.  If I'm in the area I'll be back again."}
{"text":"1st time here.  I was disappointed with the choice, the Chilaqulles.  The corn tortillas were soggy, & the crisp was only on the edges. 

I will be back but won't ever order any Mexican dish.   The sandwiches do look good, I will try one of those next time."}
{"text":"Great pecan apple pancakes!  Superb decaf coffee.  Servers and counter staff are bright and smiling.  Restaurant was clean.  I have already recommended it to another foodie.

IF you park in the public lot, just west of the restaurant on 3rd street and eat within 60 minutes, it is free of charge to park."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and enjoyed stellar service with Eric at the bar area. This is a really cool concept - the perfect mix of healthy, fresh meal options and adult beverages like a cucumber Bloody Mary or strawberry basil mimosa (yes please!). Only in town for a few days but will definitely be returning before the trip is over. Great prices and super friendly service."}
{"text":"Outstanding brunch and wonderful bloody Mary's! Everything was fairly priced and the atmosphere was great. I will defiantly be back any time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad, which was probably a mistake, as the other brunch options looked scrumptious. My salad was tasty except some of the greens were wilted and brown - a quick appetite killer for me (yay rotting greens!) stick with other options and you'll probably love it. The iced latte was good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love when I come to Phoenix for work because I have some of the best dining experiences in the world.

I found N Counter on Yelp and decided to stop in for a late breakfast. All I can say is WOW! My boyfriend had a veggie, egg breakfast sandwich. I tried the spinach eggs Benedict, breakfast potatoes and the red velvet waffles. Everything we ate was excellent. He actually said, \"this is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had! It has everything I love on it.\"

The waffles were magical! Like a desert or guilty pleasure. I love my eggs Benedict as it was perfect in every way.

The vibe was cool and laid back, good service, great location and perfect food. I've added this to my list of go to's when I'm in Tempe!

Pure perfection!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so this isn't technically in scottsdale, but its worth the drive. 

AMAZING food. I haven't ordered anything I didn't like and I am hooked on the croque monsieur. They also source all their ingredients locally including their amazing coffee. 

Seating here is hard to come by so if you're in a pair, have one stand in line to order and the other find a table."}
{"text":"The only reason I left off a star is because its a bit pricey. 

The first time I went I got the chipotle egg burrito and it was FANTASTIC! It was filling and actually one of the cheaper breakfasts on the menu.

The next time I went I ordered the Croque Monsieur, and lets just say... I've never ordered anything else from Ncounter again! I now ALWAYS get the Croque Monsieur. Sourdough bread topped with ham, tomatoes, gruyere, mustard, and two basted eggs. Every time I go back I tell myself to try something new like Bananas Fosters French (which looks so yummy!), but I a,ways go back to this. 

But, as I mentioned, it is quite pricey for something next to a college campus. The mimosas were over $5 and, while tasty, we're small and not a good value. I also believe the food prices may have raised since their opening. Maybe this is because of their quick rise in popularity."}
{"text":"YUM, I really enjoy the food every time I go and the service is generally pretty quick, as a result though of delicious food and good service the place is generally packed whcih is great for them but not so great for my toes when I'm trying to get to my table."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch. Daniel, the manager, welcomed us and took our order at the walk up counter. The menus are placed in a stand before you reach the counter. We perused the menu of their offerings. Breakfast and lunch is served here. 
I chose the Natie Bomb hot sandwich. It had smoked turkey, Gouda, apple wood bacon and thinly sliced green apple on whole grain bread; I chose half a sandwich with a house salad. The house salad was tasty, fresh and full of mixed greens, purple grapes and walnuts--with a light vinegarette dressing.
My husband ordered a cold sandwich: smokehouse avocado stack with kettle style chips. We both drank cold ice water for our beverages.
Our food was fresh and delicious. Every bite was like a little bit of heaven in my mouth. This restaurant is healthy. The serving size is more than adequate; you will not leave here hungry.
We will return next time to try their breakfast as they have a good selection of egg dishes, waffles, pancakes, etc.
If you are searching for a quaint little restaurant-you won't be disappointed--you might instead ask yourself where has this place been all my life?"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Get the grilled cheese.  Breathtaking.  And might I recommend a mimosa?"}
{"text":"Breakfast hits the right note except when it calls for tomato. You're five minus one, N Counter, because you have not invested in juicy plump tomatoes and instead are serving the same lifeless pink sponges as McD's. They're a shameful distraction to an otherwise zesty breakfast. I'm sure Willcox, Ariz., would be glad to provide you with tasty Arizona-grown hydroponic tomatoes from NatureSweet."}
{"text":"Pancake Fail
I have been here a few times and have always looked forward to eating here. I have recommended Ncounter to out of towners and friends. However, based on my most recent experience I will have to recommend a new place in Phoenix & Tempe.
I placed an order to go for 3 separate breakfast/lunch items. 2 of the orders were quite disappointing. 
The egg omelette request was for egg whites well that was ignored. I understand that mix-up.
Now the pancake order was a JOKE. All 3 pancakes were ridiculously burned and were promptly thrown out. I have included a picture of the pancakes. Honestly the person who allowed this order should probably be looking for a new job. I am not sure if QUALITY is a top concern any longer. 
I left a message for the manager and I hope to get a call soon."}
{"text":"Had to pay $1.50 for a parking spot out front. Not a good start...

12:30pm on a Friday and there was no line. Another bad sign... 

The atmosphere was bright, urban hipster. That's cool. The service was prompt and friendly. Lots of goodies in the display case. Yay! Things are looking up.

The Blackberry Jasmine Green Tea was crisp and fresh. Only sat for a few minutes when my food was delivered and boy, did it look good!  Unfortunately, that's where the good part ends...

It may have been the prettiest Tuna Melt I've eaten in a long time but it was also one of the worst. I used five napkins--FIVE!--to sop up all the dripping mayonnaise from this tuna salad that was spewing all over my plate/side salad/table/lap. Yuck. When are restaurants going to learn that you only put enough mayo in tuna salad to hold the ingredients together??? I'm sorry, but if you hold up a tuna sandwich and it all drips out, you've done something wrong. Such a shame because it really did look pretty on the plate... 

I was even more disappointed to find that they drenched the side salad in WAY too much balsamic dressing, so I abandoned that completely.

And the final nail in the coffin was the \"Ncounter\" signature dessert which is a combination brownie/oreo/chocolate-chip cookie. It was $4 and I only took one bite. SO DRY! Ugh.

I had wanted to try them again for breakfast sometime but I really doubt that I will."}
{"text":"Man, it was a busy Saturday, lol. I had to give this place a try since I heard so many good things about it. I walked in with a few friends and you actually order first at the back and they bring you the food later. I thought it was going to be where we sat down first then someone takes our order, but that wasn't the case. There was four of us and we got an order of a sandwich, omelet, and two eggs benedict. I got the eggs benedict and it was something new for me. I got to say it was really delicious. I loved it. The problem was that I had an appetite that day so I was still hungry, lol. 

The staff were professional and the food came out in a timely manner. I took a sip of someone's orange juice at our table and well, lets just say they serve alcohol and it was quite tasty. The vibe of the place was nice and relaxed. Every one there seemed they were having a good time and it also looked very clean and organized. If the weather was nice or whatever you feel is nice there is an outdoor patio if you like eating outdoors. All in all, place was nice, staff was good, and food was awesome. I will definitely be back here again and if you love breakfast/brunch then I'd say give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place was not expected on Mill Ave. Great food with a modern feel. Banana Foster French Toast was incredible. Smoothie was decent, but we came for breakfast anyway. If you want me to rate the smoothies I would say 3 out of 5... Breakfast was an easy 5 out of 5 stars. Do not avoid this place assuming it is the typical Mill Ave dive, it is worth the trip no matter where you live."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place from my AIRBNB guy and I love it. I can't believe I have never been here before. The portions were great and service was excellent. We got the French toast and the loaded omelet. No complaints on either. Highly recommend this place for breakfest."}
{"text":"Great food AND service!  Definitely will be back. Thanks for the Bloody Mary's and breakfast!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy breakfast place and easy location to slide into.  Not a huge menu and challenging seating, but its nice for what they offer."}
{"text":"The ncounter omelette is really good, I just wish it wasn't drowned in hollandaise sauce. The staff is friendly and the ambiance is chill!"}
{"text":"There are sweet spots for the timing of Ncounter meals, like any Breakfast/Blunch place. The busy times are jam-packed, while the slow times are still pretty full. Try for 1-3 pm if you can. It isn't as much of a problem as it used to be, as the staff has grown to accommodate the large crowds very well.

Croque Monsieur SVP, although I can never finish the whole thing. The eggs here are...awesome, simply. Never have I seen so many perfectly cooked eggs in so many styles.

The best part for me: grapefruit sangria."}
{"text":"Work in the area and been told about their great breakfasts that you can eat all day! Wandered in to friendly service staff and great eats! I got the veggie omlet and a passion tea. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Food came in a timely manner and the staff bends over backwords to make sure you are comfortable- know how things work (OK you push the ice dispenser for ice.. I am lame, thank you for not making fun of me) and make sure your spot is clean when you are finished. My next visit I need to try something else on this tasty menu! 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Very nice. Food was great, and they had an extensive menu. The food was presented beautifully, and you can order your choice of sides with everything (fresh fruit, salad, fries, etc)."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance, so the plan was to make this my new regular spot. Here's the problem though. They put so much into their fancy sandwiches and atmosphere, that they seem to have left nothing for decent toilet paper. Sorry Ncounter. But I have a sensitive stomach and often the toilet paper is the last thing I experience at restaurants, and yours must be the cheapest your TP vendor had to offer. It's really my only complaint, but it's enough to keep me from coming back ?"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent visitor, here. At this point, I don't know if my body could even function without their Strawberry-Banana smoothie at least two times a week. It tastes like it was blended with angel powder. The unicorn of smoothies."}
{"text":"Excellent choices for breakfast or brunch.  The pear omelette is a hidden gem with an unlikely combination of pear, havarti cheese, and slivered almonds.  The coffee drinks are great and were brought to our table quickly after we placed our ordered.  The timing of breakfast service was perfect, and being able to sit outside is such a treat."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food. I didn't have one of their pancakes, but they are HUGE and look very yummy indeed. Go early, as it does get quite crowded."}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good here, but the service is terrible. No one is smiling or happy to serve. They forget your requests for condiments and make you work to realize even your smallest ask. They come across as arrogant and will most likely be abandoned by customers for the many other restaurants in the near vicinity."}
{"text":"The whole fam had been eagerly anticipating the opening (how long did it take btw!) of this place. The tempe location is our fave but it's just too far away. We thought this would be our forever breakfast spot. Until we ate there. The food took too long, and it wasn't even good. Several of us didn't finish our meals. We will stay away for awhile but hope they get their act together soon."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a good breakfast place along the light rail. FOUND IT! A fast causal breakfast with a fine dining feel. Nice happy employees, clean and sunny environment.
I got the eggs Benedict (hard to make perfect but it was good) $8.5
my daughter had the pancakes with blueberries and REAL CREAM. Best pancakes and value. $6.5
Hubby had waffles with strawberries and real cream
$6.5
Then we tried the hulk smoothie. The smoothie was mostly just ice so wasn't impressed by that 5$
So fair prices for a nice breakfast experience."}
{"text":"O.M.G. I am definitely a breakfast food lover. I will choose breakfast food over any other sort of food anytime. My friend suggested this morning that we go get brunch at NCounter. I am always on board to try new things.

We pulled up, walked in and I am immediately impressed by the number of people in there enjoying their brunch. I look up at the menu and I am also really happy to see the wide range of things to try. After this trip I want to go back and try them all. This time, though, I decided on one of the \"Almost Fried\" sandwiches called House Request. It sounded so interesting with multiple types of veggies and with olive tapenade (WHICH IS MY FAVORITE) and cream cheese with an over easy egg. It was so good. I also got a side of the grilled potatoes. They were delicious. My friend and I decided brunch wasn't brunch without some morning cocktails, she got a bloody mary (and since she'd been here multiple times before, she already knew she loved them) and I got a mimosa and it was so good! 

Needless to say, I will be back to NCounter to try all of the wonderful things on the menu. Especially that Pecan Cinnamon Roll. It looked so good!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food. Unfortunately, the service is lacking where the food succeeds. The last several times I've been there, the staff have seemed highly stressed and agitated and frankly, have pretty bad attitudes. 

I think I'll try a new place for my Saturday and Sunday brunches."}
{"text":"Took the kids out for brunch after their swim lessons, just happened to stumble on this place. The staff was super friendly and attentive. Service was quick and the food was delicious. Definitely get the red velvet waffles, those were super yummy. Kids loved their Mickey Mouse pancakes. Mom enjoyed the farmers market eggs Benedict. They just opened Monday, (3 days ago), it's still nice and new smelling- so run in before the crowds do!!

One suggestion I have is maybe adding a milk substitute for the coffee? I got a latte, which was delicious, but I typically like to get it with coconut milk or almond milk."}
{"text":"Our 1 hour drive to Tempe for NCounter was worth every penny.  Great value for the $$$.  Very inexpensive meals with friendly/helpful staff."}
{"text":"Place was totally crowded everybody having fun food is great, came fast even with the crowd and it's expensive. Love it!"}
{"text":"AWESOME place - The Chocolate Chip pancakes with Strawberries and whipped cream are ridiculous. Add a mimosa and you're in business. Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I had the bananas forester. It was pretty tasty but it came out a little cold (not fresh off the stove), and it had a really weird slimy texture. The syrup was not normal syrup and I could not get over how snot-like the syrup was, in texture and appearance. Anyhow, I eventually got over it enough to eat it and it was pretty good. Not excellent, but 4 stars.  The service was pretty quick and I thought it was a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars just because their smoothies are amazing. Mimosas too expensive for size, but the smoothies trump that."}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast! Fresh healthy ingredients, very tasty. Enjoyed sitting out on the patio."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing as well as the bloody Mary's. The only downfall is the wait time. Very slow service. They did apologize and gave us a free drink to make up for it"}
{"text":"A word of advice to those eating in the Tempe area: avoid restaurants filled with trendy vibes, trendy college students, and 40-somethings dressing 20-something to relive their trendy years. Do I sound petty? Perhaps. But I stand by that statement and Ncounter is probably the best proof I can display to fulfill my words.

Aesthetically, Ncounter appears to be your standard wannabee \"coffee center of intellect.\" Sepia toned pictures of windmills straight out of the Wizard of Oz, run-of-the-mill bright wood tables, a \"bar,\" and a hand full of the self-proclaimed elite trend monkeys I just love so much to hate. What a bore. 

Now being my first, and hopefully last, visit to Ncounter both myself and the person I came with were slightly taken back by the new menu. Standing a few feet away from the actual ordering area we spent at least five or so minutes pondering upon what to eat. Everything sounded so appealing and utterly delicious! Every breakfast classic from eggs benedict (shortened to \"bene's\" ugh...) to your standard omelette had enough variations available to please nearly any palette. Already in the mood for an omelette, I gravitated towards an item entitled the \"Hot Juan.\" Chorizo, salsa, jalapenos, cheese, peppers, and onions; sounds wonderful does it not? My breakfast mate decided upon a somewhat similar option, \"Huevos n' Chorizo.\" Essentially the same dish only the eggs are served sunny side rather than in omelette form. We also ordered a side of sourdough toast and a coffee to share. **The coffee here is self serve, something I have not before seen in a restaurant. A great idea I wish more establishments would catch on to.**

Before I get into the actual food itself I want to discuss the vibe and service of Ncounter. The place is infested with what could possibly be the rudest, most self-absorbed, trendy, soul wretched, basic, and nasty clientele and staff on Earth. Everyone from the man behind the ordering counter to the bus boys to the gathering of Pitchfork Media fans (some of them were actually wearing the logo on their clothes...) exuded a vile aura of judgement. Sneering and sneakily nodding at the apparently entertaining crowd around them, each and every individual resembled a cartoon character created to fill the world with angst and elitism. I could not help but feel like an onlooker of a real life Breakfast Club. Clashing cliques of staff and customers. Is this a restaurant or high school? Also really did not appreciate my server essentially tossing my plate of food on the table and scurrying away without a word. 

Okay so you get the point, the place is hipster hell. Or maybe I'm just being dramatic. I imagine everyone will have different opinion on the matter. Fortunately, I actually do have something both undeniable AND negative to spew about Ncounter. The food resembled that of a musty and fly ridden diner I once ate at in a nightmare I had years ago. In fact, it was so insultingly putrid and revolting I refuse to actually go in depth. So instead here is a short list of single words that describe the slop I was served:
1. Cold
2. Meatless
3. Pace (yes, like the salsa brand)
4. Floppy
5. Speechless 

Ncounter serves no purpose for a foodie, which is weird because I seem to have developed a love-hate relationship with the dump over the course of writing this review. I absolutely LOVE and ADORE the fact that Ncounter is essentially the restaurant equivalent to an Old-Western brothel. The over-hyped food and foul attitude of the place keeps trendy people out of my sight much like cheap whiskey and prostitutes herded the mongrel masses of times past into a playpen of their own filthy ways. I absolutely HATE everything else about it. 

In case you didn't pick this up on your own, the ever increasing anger in the tone of my review really just represents EXACTLY how my experience played out... Also I feel ashamed I actually devoted so much emotion and time into writing about Ncounter. God, even the name is terrible isn't?"}
{"text":"I have been a long-time fan and customer of this restaurant but the experience I had on March 18, 2018 was terrible.  Granted it was the mid-morning breakfast rush on a Saturday but the staff made the situation worse by continuing to take orders and have the kitchen pump out food when there was no place to sit and no prospects of anyone leaving soon.  Some of our food was handed to us as we stood waiting on a table to open up, other food was delivered to our table 30 minutes later and finally, after 45 minutes our two veggie omelets were delivered after repeated trips to the kitchen, interrupting the texting servers and asking them where our order was.  I attempted to contact a manager to show him/her our burned omelets but could not get anyone's attention.  Finally left out of frustration without eating the burned omelets.  Not planning a return visit.  Horrible experience and more embarrassing because we had brought out-to-town guests with us."}
{"text":"I've been three times now.  I would suggest starting with the Original Chop Salad and their Chocolate Chip Cookie and a drool napkin for lunch  I am going to have to start attending meetings.  JUST WOW."}
{"text":"I love this place. They deliver on a trendy cool place to eat, very broad selection, and everything's good. I've been going here for close to a year to have brunch and I always walk away feeling well fed, never gross or bloated."}
{"text":"I was in town on business, stopped in 2pm on a Friday and the young guy at the counter was very unfriendly towards me as I tried to engage in general conversation regarding this being my first visit and I told him I was a vegan. 
Waiting for any recommendations, I ended up just getting a salad to go.
He did not smile nor did he say \"thank you\".  I pride myself on being a great tipper and for the first time ever I did not leave tip. 
As I waited for my order, I watched him interact with other customers and he immediately came to life when a couple of young Caucasian women approached his counter... thanks, smiled, eye contact, etc.
Next I saw a young Black gentleman approach the counter and his whole demeanor changed, in fact this young Black man appeared to be mentally disabled and was having some difficulty.  I watched and saw how the guy working humiliated and dehumanized the customer... laughing and joking with coworkers at the customers behalf.
When in town I will not come back to this place, I'll spend my money at an establishment that treats everyone with dignity and kindness.
In the end the food was just ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Food was yummy!! I got the French toast. 
The place was cute! 

The cashier was rude to my sister and it took a while to get our food, and we didn't get a table marker, so the servers didn't know where to bring our food. 

Overall I'd still come back but I hope their service gets better."}
{"text":"A friend and I were looking for a place that boasted delicious food and drinks for brunch last Sunday, and we decided to try out NCounter. We arrived at 9:30 a.m. before any rush, which is ALWAYS a huge plus. I felt lucky. The ladies at the counter were perky for a Sunday morning, which is more than I could say for myself...COFFEE PLEASE! 

After deliberating with my friend about which two dishes to choose out of the dozens that sounded fantastic, I ordered The Pear-- complete with bosc pear, havarti cheese, sliced almonds and bacon. My friend ordered the huevos and chorizo! These meals were tres bien and aye aye aye awesome, respectively. The Pear had crispy bacon served up in the cheesy goodness, which was balanced out by the crisp pears and almonds. I enjoyed the array of tastes present. I topped mine off with a Bloody Mary, which was served in a tall glass with just the right amount of spice. Hurray!  The huevos and chorizo was the right amount of mess. The combination of chorizo, onions, grilled potatoes, salsa, cheese with flour tortilla can never steer me wrong after any night, especially a long one. Our waters were consistently refilled for us by wandering good-looking waiters. The aesthetics and atmosphere looked and felt good to me. There is also the right amount of people-watching one can do here, from the hungover sorority types, to the bicycling hipsters, and cheery family members and friends greeting one another. I was entertained.

However, the queue steadily grew towards the door while we enjoyed our conversation and brekkie. So, while I love it, I will never go there during the rush hours. I totally understand some of the frustration about wait times. SO! That said, overall experience was fantastic and I'll get my slow butt up early for breakfast again and again! :)"}
{"text":"This establishment is everything I thought it was going to be and some. You walk in and order your food then find your own table in or outside. They also have amazing bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"Yum. NCounter. 

I can't believe I've only been to this place once; my first time being last week. 

I always see NCounter while I'm browsing Yelp and think \"I need to try this place!\". So when I finally went to lunch with two of my girlfriends here, I was more than anxious to see what it was about. 

I brought my dog so we sat outside on the patio. The patio is a great size and was all shaded so it wasn't very hot. One of the workers even brought out a dog bowl of water for my dog which was really sweet. 

We chatted over bloody mary's, mimosas, and bellinis for a couple of hours. I wasn't hungry at the time so I didn't' try any of the food, but my friend is somewhat obsessed with this place and says their food is amazing! 

The only bummer is that this place closes early (I think 3). The patio started to shut down and I was surprised that they were closing. 

Overall, if you're near Mill and are looking to get breakfast or lunch, go here."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my $10 breakfast sandwich. Bread wasn't toasted, cheese only on one side (means it totally fell apart!), and sausage casing was so tough you couldn't bite through it. 

I didn't even touch the potatoes because they weren't fresh. Really, could have gone to McDonalds and been more satisfied. 

Traveling for work, so I'll just keep trying different places."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, reasonable prices, a friendly staff and a good vibe. When I need breakfast or a good sandwich, that's the place for me in Tempe."}
{"text":"The quality of food is good and the price is fair but watch your receipt or you may find hidden charges. Gabbie J was my cashier and added an additional tip to my purchase. I was appalled by this theft! When I go to a restaurant I expect good service, food, and honesty. I work hard for my money and when someone tries to rob me I take it personally. That woman deserves to be fired and I may report you to the better business bureau because that is wrong to rob your patrons. I came here in earnest but what you did was unacceptable Gabbie. While I appreciate Lex for his help reversing the transaction it should never have happened. Please ensure your employees are quality next time. Low paid employees and in no short supply by ASU so please find ones with integrity. I will never return here and urge all other patrons to reconsider before stopping here. At the very least wait for your receipt and ensure you were charged properly."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM! This place makes me want to leave California! Have to try the Jam it is the best!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast last weekend - arrived about 10 to a packed restaurant but managed to find a couple of seats at the bar. Ordered some pancakes, the house Ncounter omelet and a couple of drinks from the coffee bar.   We were told by the bartender to go fetch our own silverware and water. Our food arrived prior to our drinks and my omelet was REALLY cold - like I mean the broccoli was still slightly frozen - too bad considering it's their house specialty - the hashbrowns were also undercooked and the cream cheese glob was just overkill on the omelet.  Our coffees finally showed up, bu they must have run short on milk since there was a two inch gap at the top of my cup.  Fortunately, the pancakes were pretty darn good.   Needless to say, we won't be making the drive from Phoenix again any time soon..."}
{"text":"ordered a variety of things, coffee was no good, thought it was the creamer but it was the coffee. got a 12oz kids milk $3.70.

food was nothing spectacular, i would say on same par as first watch. haven't been to any of their other locations, but i would chalk this up as a so so breakfast place."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased since I was part of the opening team, but Ncounter has continued to provide awesome service and dangerously delicious food for years now. It's a tough spot being right by the light rail and on Mill Ave., yet the service is always consistent. They've continued to expand as much as possible to accommodate more guests, too. And did I mention the food was to die for??"}
{"text":"Love this place and the food. Always friendly staff. Really happy there is one so close to my work in Downtown Phoenix, so I can make it here more often."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Sometimes the line gets long but usually not a huge wait for a table. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Great salads and sandwitch selection. So far I have only tried the vegetarian mushroom sandwitch and I love it so much I'm afraid to try anything else. 
The vibe is more modern and upbeat. Food comes out relatively quick.
They are very busy during lunch hours so try to avoid going there between 11pm - 1pm if you don't like crowds."}
{"text":"Visited a college town breakfast joint.  What a great experience.  Outstanding food and service."}
{"text":"Whenever friends or family are in town I always take them here for brunch because of the wide variety of great eats. They have a nice outdoor patio to enjoy your meal at too. Extra points for good music!"}
{"text":"Mill Ave has been missing a good breakfast nook, and it has made me very sad. Until now! The atmosphere is very modern. The color scheme is gray, orange, and black and boy do they stick to it, down to the orange frosted cupcakes. Impressive. I had the best french toast I have ever had in my life right here at NCounter. I have only eaten here once, and usually I don't give five stars out after the first visit, but this place is THAT good. So happy to have such a fabulous breakfast restaurant so close to home."}
{"text":"Heard it was good but waited over 20 minutes for food while everyone around us was served.  Not even that busy.  Never got a straight answer on when food would be ready.  Don't recommend."}
{"text":"While it takes a minute to get used to the minimalist service approach at Ncounter (order at the bar, seat yourself, get your own water, etc), the food and pricing easily make up for it. Had an extremely decent Eggs Benedict (sauce was good, egg was appropriately runny, ingredients were fresh), with a side of bacon and fried potatoes. They made them crispy as I asked without overcooking the egg... sounds simple, but you'd be shocked to know how rarely you can find that, even at restaurants that charge three to five times more. 

Also ordered and enjoyed a good cappuccino (tasted fresh ground and from decent beans), and tried one of the Bloody Marys as well (basil lime). I wouldn't order the Mary again, but not because it wasn't well-made; it was, and also featured lovely fresh ingredients. I just prefer a classic Mary flavor profile. Next time I will order the mimosa... definitely going back. Be careful not to hang out too long at the downtown location - if you go over an hour, you'll have to pay to get out of the parking garage. Overall, one of the best breakfast destinations in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place just based off of the yelp rating and ended up with a disappointment on my face on the way out. The layout reminds me of places I've gone to out in San Francisco. However, even though the ambience was nice on the inside and outside the food was definitely below average. The eggs were good; It's not too difficult to ruin eggs. But the pancakes, which is a signature component of the meal, were very bland. They didn't have any flavor whatsoever. It literally tasted as if the ingredients were the staple ingredients for basic pancakes. I was also unimpressed with the syrup; the thinner, the better and theirs was average. Overall, I may beating this place up and. It taking into consideration it's located in the middle of a college town. But I wasn't impressed. The staff was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Did not care for how the food was prepared. Hot breakfast with a ice cold slice of tomato  :(  it was off putting. Could not taste any alcohol in the Bloody Mary's. It just was not what we expected."}
{"text":"From the time we ordered to the time the food was placed at our table was 30 mins! Then when our food arrived it was cold! All 5 of us had cold food. It was terrible! You can tell the potatoes weren't even cooked long enough, they were soggy and cold. I've eaten here many times, this was the least busy and the worst experience! Maybe it's not busy because they are starting to make so many errors! I'd recommend a dozen other restaurants over here any day now!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here almost every day while in town for work. Conveniently located between my office and hotel, they have a simple menu of breakfast items, sandwiches, salads and smoothies. The Hulk is one of the best smoothies I've had in a while, and at $5, you can't beat it.  The employees are friendly and the place is very clean. My only complaint is that one morning, I ordered oatmeal to go. It took at least 25 minutes and ended up being quick oats, not even steel cut. The menu didn't specify, so I should have asked."}
{"text":"Came in Saturday morning for breakfast. There was a long line, but it moved quickly. I got the granola pancakes, SO got the morning glory omelet with potatoes. Took about fifteen minutes for our food to arrive. Also, we appreciated that the menu indicated gluten-free items!

Boyfriend was very pleased with his omelet and sides. The granola pancake was basically just granola thrown on to their regular pancake batter. It was good, but I was disappointed to find that one of my pancakes was raw on the inside (next to the granola). We will return, but I am going to get a different dish next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Labor Day for (hangover) brunch.  The eggs Benedict was AMAZING!  They were super busy, but seemed to handle it well.  The food came out quickly, and when the tea and coffee dispensers were out, when we told a server they replaced it right away.  Although the food was delicious, the only thing I didn't like about it was the way you went and ordered first and then found a seat.  It's kind of like an in between of fast food and sit down restaurant, which is fine, but because the place is so small I had to hunt for a table.  I eventually went and swooped in on a table while my boyfriend waited in line to order because we were worried there wouldn't be any tables left by the time our food came.  Other than that, everything was perfect.  I will definitely be back, but probably on a day when they are not quite so busy"}
{"text":"Awesome little place on Mill Ave in Tempe! It was super busy but the line went quick. You go up and order and then seat yourself. Everyone is super attentive. I had the banana foster French toast! It was sweet but very good. I would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and awesome food. The place is worth the money and I definitely recommend the waffles or one of the skillets. Clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance with a great patio.  I had the croque madam, which was excellent.  The gluten-free waffle was also great!  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of the Ncounter in Tempe but I dropped by the one in PHX last week and was so pleased! The service was awesome, KYLIE who was working really impressed my boyfriend and I and thanks to her we will be back. The service was great even as they were nearing close (this is not easy to find) and the food was delicious. The muffins are warm and the butter that comes with makes them melt in your mouth and the French toast was some of the best I've had in a while. 

Go Ncounter & Go Kylie!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the 1st time this morning and it will NOT be the last.

Ordering was easy and quick. Although the place was *packed* we were able to find a seat relatively quickly. Our food was out w/ in 10 mins after we sat down. And it was GOOD.

My husband had the cheese omelet, I had the pear omelet, yes pear. With havarti, bacon, and almonds. We both got their homefries and an english muffin on the side.  First, the muffins came w/ apple cinnamon jelly. It was So good. Their potatoes were the perfect mix of crunchy and soft, and the omelet, oh man. I knew I was taking a food risk by ordering a pear omelet but im so glad i did. Its something I never wouldve thought would taste as amazing as it did. 

Go here, but be warned, theyre only open until 3:05 pm."}
{"text":"Simply a great place to stop in and enjoy some morning chomp. Been coming here since just after they opened and have always had good food and great coffee. Let the kids spin you up a tasty smoothly."}
{"text":"We have been lost without Palette in Downtown Phx, but this place may be our new spot.  The atmosphere is great, clean modern lines and very trendy setup.  The staff very friendly the owner? walking around checking on guests to make sure everyone is pleased with their orders.  The food DELISH!  I had the plain and simple (eggs, potatoes, toast $5.50) simple and great tasting.  My husband  had the  Croquet Monsieur and loved it and for $7.50 you cannot beat it.  Great for families or meeting up with a friend.  This place is amazing and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Um, this place is amazing. I mean whew. The cinnamon apple pecan pancakes. Chile. I almost died and went to carb heaven! The seating is first come first served so be sure to grab a table the minute you eye it. Have someone hold down the fort while you get in line to order. Everything on the menu looked scrumptious, and they even care about their presentation! That never happens. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot. Ordered to-go order and took over 45 minutes. I actually believe they may have re made my order. Seemed like a lot of workers standing around and chatting opposed to working but food was pretty good when we got home."}
{"text":"Right in the middle of downtown Tempe you will find a plethora of restaurants, bars and shops.  So what made us choose NCounter?  Well first of all we wanted breakfast and secondly you never say no to my cousin Tina.  So we entered a place that normally I would have walked past, well I am super happy we didn't pass this place up.

First and foremost if you see an empty table when you walk in, GRAB IT, they are as rare as Foie Gras is in California.  Next go stand in line to order and pay or you will never get fed.  So even though this place sort of starts out like a fast food restaurant, the attention to the food served severs that connection very quickly.  The food is really good and made to order.

I ordered The Killer breakfast sandwich.  It was a \"nearly\" fried egg with blue cheese, tomatoes and perfectly cooked bacon on a ciabatta roll.  The sandwich was very tasty I only wish I had switched out the bread, ciabatta is not my favorite bread and yet this one was still very soft and tasty.  Hubby got the Croque Monsieur, he liked his meal but he is spoiled and normally eats them at a real French restaurant so he wasn't over joyed.  However they gained points when he was served a spicy Bloody Mary, oh yes my friends they have a full bar.

So breakfast was good, but it is crazy in here.  People are coming and going all the time, it's crowded and REALLY LOUD (did you hear me?)  Also parking can be challenging.  We were very lucky because we were there on a Sunday and the College students are on break (ASU is right around the corner).

All in all, I would definitely like to have their food again, but I think next time I will take it to go and find a quiet spot to enjoy a gourmet breakfast.  Oh they have lunch items too, but don't go after 3pm because they will be closed."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, delicious food, and very friendly staff!

I gave three stars because this spot still has some kinks to work out.  We sat at the bar for brunch, and were promptly greeted.  While our bartender Kurtis was incredibly friendly, he was beyond buried behind the bar.  Not only was he waiting on his bar guests, but he was making all the coffee, juice, and alcohol drinks for the whole restaurant (which was full) alone! He did not get any help in the hour and 15 minutes we were there, which was crazy to us! 

We ordered mimosas right when we sat, which took about 10 minutes to make.  Our food took over 30 minutes to arrive.  As I looked around, I noticed this seemed to be par for the course.  I had the Denver saute, husband had the Benedict and both were hot and delish!

Our food and drinks were worth the wait- this time- but I wouldn't make this a frequent spot if this is their style and standard of service.  It honestly seems like they are already incredibly popular, and just need to staff up, add a manager or two, and work out the kinks.

We will be back in a few months :)"}
{"text":"The hulk is delish and not too heavy like the PB&J smoothie. Got the Asian salad and everything was super fresh.. The cilantro made the salad. Can't wait to try there bfast.. The French toast looks enormous!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is always spotless outside and always leaves a bit to be desired on the patio. Food is excellent. It's obvious they use quality ingredients. For some items, portions are a little small for the price. For others, they're huge. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, though. Always cooked to order and always done quickly."}
{"text":"NCounter is still here and still awesome. After initially being nervous about it's well being I feel comfortable giving it the big five stars and a lot of my love. I have been here a ton of times since discovering it and have had nothing but good experiences, NCounter is my favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"First off, NCounter has such an amazing atmosphere. It's always bustling with students and is the perfect place to meet up for brunch with a friend. It's located right in the heart of Downtown Tempe on Mill Ave and is conveniently located next to the light rail. If you're not taking the light rail or getting there on foot, then I suggest parking in the parking lot behind Hayden Square Condominiums on 3rd Street and Ash. It's open, free, and NCounter is literally steps away!

Now onto the food!!! The food not only tastes amazing, but is beautifully presented. Just by looking at the plate you would never imagine that it only cost $7-$9! Though there are many more that I have yet to try, my favorite as of right now is the House Request plate under the \"Almost Fried\" Breakfast section. The olive tapenade/cream cheese combination is so delicious and the side salad gives a nice balance to the sandwich! The only negative is that the eggs are sometimes a little too runny for the sandwich making it a little difficult to eat, but is still yummy nonetheless. For those who want something more sweet then there are pancakes and french toast that are simple, but do just the trick (or pastries if you want something small). If you're not in the breakfast mood then there are also many sandwiches and salads to choose from. Although this place is always packed I have never waited long for my food and the service is always excellent. 

If you are in the area by chance or for some festivities taking place on Mill/Tempe Town Lake, then I would highly recommend stopping by here for a bite to eat. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Overall dissatisfied with my experience. Prices are a little high for what you get. They seem to have a ton of staff behind the main counter but depending on the time of day (or some other inscrutable factor?) they want customers to order everything at the coffee bar counter, not the main counter. They don't make it very clear and I've witnessed a lot of confusion over where to order by other customers. Despite so many \"cooks\" in the kitchen, simple orders take a long time coming out, even to go orders. On my last visit I ordered a full breakfast, the salad it came with was wilty (didn't realize til I was gone and it was too late) and the eggs smelled so horrible I was actually looking around the elevator I was in to see who else was causing the stink. When I got to my desk I realized my breakfast was the culprit behind the reek. Not awesome. Also, staff seem aloof, like maybe they think they are too cool for their customers. 
This place is right next to my office and I wanted to like them. But I won't be wasting any more time or money here in the future."}
{"text":"For a counter-service breakfast and lunch place N'Counter is among the best. Prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh. While you should always tip service-industry professionals, the nice thing about counter service is that you generally don't have to tip as much, saving some money.

This place gets very busy with the Mill Ave. business lunch crowd plus ASU students, so arrive early. It can quickly get crowded inside. The outdoor patio is a better option except in the hottest months (they do offer misters). Sneak around the back side for a quieter table.

Entrees I'd recommend include the Morning Glory Omelette and the Mediterranean Salad, but there are plenty more I want to try!"}
{"text":"Oh Ncounter.  I was so excited. Why oh why was my food so cold and flavorless.

I live within biking distance to Mill, so I was thrilled to see a new cool spot was opening up.  I was picturing cruising to Ncounter to grab a coffee and an omelet and going about my merry way.
Sadly, this fantasy will not come to fruition.

Understandably, the place has only been open a week.  I know how hard it can be to work out the opening kinks, I've been in service for going on a hundred years now, so if I happen to go back, I'll be happy to reevaluate.  But honestly, this isn't the first restaurant you've opened...so why the subpar food???

I can only speak about the food I tried, so here it goes:
I ordered a latte and the Greek omelet.  I was pleasantly surprised by the latte.  I get soy milk, and often places somehow manage to make it taste like wood pulp, but here they got it right! Hooray, they passed the first test!  On to the omelet.  Yuck.  I don't know what the story was with this thing.  First off, cold. Secondly, raw white onions are just not my cup of tea.  I expected them to be sauteed and possibly seasoned.  But no.  Just raw, cold white onions.  Add cold artichokes, tomatoes, and a mere hint of feta cheese, and there you have the greek omelet.  I would have hoped for some sort of seasoning...I don't even think there was salt and pepper. :(
My boyfriend got the Ncounter omelet and an americano.  Unfortunately, his were both strikes.  The americano barely tasted like espresso.  I'm not quite sure if their barista knows what they're doing.  And his omelet? wow...the presentation itself was...well...gross.  Take a look at the accompanying pics...I think cottage cheese and hollandaise sauce should be put in cups...otherwise it looks like a big, multi-colored splat.  No, the taste wasn't there either.  The hollandaise was lackluster, and that was really all that you could taste.  Damn.  I love hollandaise, I was hoping for a really indulgent, amazing, gluttony inducing, goop.  But no again.

The service was pretty good.  You could tell the cashier's were sick of the same questions, but I know how that goes.  At least they were smiling through their frustration.

I'd like to end this review by saying this: throughout writing this, I have decided to go back in a month or so.  I hope all the kinks are worked out, the cooks find their groove, and the barista gets the hang of it all.  I really would like my fantasy of a weekend brunch on the patio after a little bike ride to come true............    A five star review is in the works...I just feel it!!!"}
{"text":"Glorified Denny's is all this place is. This place used to be good but their food quality seems to have diminished. The portobello sandwich should be the spinach mayo sandwich on day old bread. Spinach and mayo being the cheapest ingredients, they def overload it and then skimp on the mushroom & artichoke. Won't be going back for anything except maybe coffee."}
{"text":"Five stars for these guys.  Great selection. Food is tight on point and creative.  Everything came out hot...even the toast!  Hit this place for a great breakfast. Wanted to try the Red Velvet Pancakes but.......   Had to think healthy..  lol"}
{"text":"A+ for food, B+ for service. Wish they offered a black iced tea."}
{"text":"I have been going here since day one and it use to be the best breakfast spot on Mill Ave in Tempe. It's sad to see such thriving business decline. The food is now served cold. The prices have been raised to not such a good value anymore. The pigeons/birds ____ all over the patio. You order food only to sit and watch 5-6 people that were behind you get theirs before you. The icing on the cake today, their POS system is down so they were turning business away. You mean to tell me you don't have a back up plan when your registers go down !?!? I know why do I keep going back ? Well honestly My Co-worker was in the same frat as the owner and I thought if I mentioned the decline to him it might get better. Pfffft they don't care. Today was it for me. To many other breakfast spots in the area now seek other options"}
{"text":"I never have a chance to try the food because my work schedule is not allowed. I ordered the hot drink to go before however I felt like this place is more like a sit down place to enjoy breakfast, than taking to-go.

Definitely will try breakfast some day."}
{"text":"N means no.  Ordered the chorizo burrito. Had only bacon. I like over easy eggs but runny scrambled in the burrito, bleh. And a rotten piece of cilantro for garnish."}
{"text":"My main thought:
If you go here, get the french toast.

I run past this restaurant frequently and I always see people eating thick, decadent pieces of french toast, draped sugary toppings and topped with a mountain of whipped cream.  I love whipped cream, if socially acceptable, I would use it as salad dressing.  So, in retrospect, I should have ordered what I knew would come with whipped cream, and therefore, be fantastic.

But, I was an hour away from attending my daughter's preschool graduation, where I knew there would be cupcakes and cookies and ice cream (and maybe even whipped cream), so I wanted something semi-light and semi-healthy.  

I was pleased to see an eggwhite omelet on the menu (it makes for easy ordering) and it sounded tasty - paired with avocado, tomato and cilantro, three foods that I adore.

We sat outside on a beautiful day.  As far as environment goes, I give this place 5 stars. It is great for people watching and you can SIT AT A BAR! for breakfast.  We opted for an outside table, right next to a girl who was eating breakfast with a baby pig sitting in her lap.  I must say, I have never ate my bacon while sitting next to a pig before - that scored a point for ambience.

Anyway, my omelette arrived  and it was very mediocre.  There was literally half an avocado embedded in my omelette, and while I do appreciate the fact that they are not stingy with the delightful green fruits, it was barely chopped and I like my avocados in manageable, bit size pieces or slices.

I ended up giving the massive chunk to my husband, who devoured it one bite.

I splurged and got potatoes (instead of fruit or cottage cheese) but they were sub par.  They were not browned and crispy, but rather yellow and soggy.  

Don't get me wrong -- the food was not bad -- I just would not order that omelette again.  But really, shame on me for not ordering what I knew would be awesome: the french toast."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong here that better management/staff couldn't fix. We went for brunch at 11am on a Sunday. I ordered for my husband and I at one register, my friend at the other, so our orders could not be put on the same table marker, even though we ordered at the same time. My friend's order of an omelette came out fairly promptly, nice and hot.  Ten minutes later our order, of pancakes and a market bennie came out stone cold. No servers asked us how things were, so rather than try and get someone to care, we just ate. My husband's blueberry pancakes had approximately 15 berries in the cakes, and a bare dozen on top. The coffee was hot, but only one of the two urns had any, and there was only one dispenser of 2% milk which ran out, so you had to visit both sides of the coffee counter to get your coffee put together.

Given that it was less crowded than normal, we were disappointed in our rather expensive ($30 for pancakes, three eggs, market Bennie and two coffees) meal. Better prices and service can be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!  Red Velvet waffles were fantastic and the Bloody Marys were wonderful. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast/brunch place to check out. They have a good selection of sandwiches and omelettes for a pretty good price (9-12$) with pretty decent portion sizes. Service was excellent and the food came out fast. Also, the wait time really depends on when you go; for us, it was not more than 10 minutes on Friday at around 12:30.

I had their 10$ breakfast sandwich and my friend had their eggs benedict. Both were pretty good; the toast was crunchy and it had lots of flavor. However, my only gripe is that the food was more on the heavy side: my sandwich had a bit more cheese and oil than I would have liked. Nevertheless, I would still recommend you try it if you are around this area."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that I eat here once a week at least this place is flame I always get the plain n simple comes with toast eggs and potatoes so good also the character of the restaurant upbeat urban and very friendly never have i once seen an unattractive or rude person working at ncounter nothing but love for this place"}
{"text":"A new breakfast place downtown? Sweet! A dog friendly patio? Excellent!
I got a waffle and Eggs Benedict. 
The waffle was really really good and the Eggs Benedict \"not bad\". 
The interior is modern and they have a nice little breakfast bar inside for immediate seating (if need be)."}
{"text":"The breakfasts here are pretty good. They have a great selection, and some vegetarian options. One time I came and the potatoes were a little dry, but other than that, all the food has been great.  I really like the cinnamony jam! 

However, if you are real coffee lover, to be frank, they don't really know what they're doing. The other day, I asked if they had half-and-half for my coffee, and they said no, they only have (fake) creamer. When I looked surprised, the barista shrugged and said he'd look into it. Today, I ordered a cappuccino, thinking that would be a safe option. But it was like 10 ounces of milk, with no foam! I could hardly taste the espresso shot. Hello: That is a latte, people. I'm sure that they could do better with the coffee, especially if the customer gives them a little guidance... which I recommend. 

Also, don't expect great table service, even if you give a normal tip. I was given an empty cup when I asked for water, and had to retrieve the water myself. Seems like it would have been easy to just fill that cup before bringing it all the way over to me, no?"}
{"text":"Cute little breaky / lunch place on Mill. Good food, vibe, and friendly staff. Pretty average lunch price wise and definitely worth checking out at least once. The dining room has a lot of tables, especially 2 tops designed for the lunch crowd. Plenty of space outside on their cool patio as well."}
{"text":"An outstanding spot to sit outside and eat.   The grilled cheese is great but the stack one is better.  Prices are reasonable and service is fast.  Get a cookie!"}
{"text":"Place was pretty much self serve service, no one greets you when you walk in, today was my first time there so you kind of don't know where to go also where to sit. It was very packed packed house. They do have a patio area to sit with misters as well but it was way to hot to wanna sit outside today. This lace reminded me of a school cafeteria. They also have a juice bar, smoothies, mimosas and bloody mary's. Customer service was great, everyone's very helpful and happy! I would go here again!!"}
{"text":"The menu has GF next to all of the gluten-free options. The options are mostly breakfast and salad but there are several choices. Potato vodka for your Bloody Mary even!!"}
{"text":"We were here for a Sunday brunch and oh lord it was packed. It took some time to get seated as it is all open seating. Food was delicious and the wait was quite a worth. I simply love the interiors and will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"I gave this 3 stars because I got the morning glory omelet and it honestly wasn't that great. Just didn't do much for me. The potatoes were good though. 

The rest of my party had delicious food. Someone had the biscuits and gravy, which were really good. The chipotle breakfast burrito was really good and the bananas foster French toast was really really good. 

There was a long line, but it went quickly. Great service."}
{"text":"Nice cafe on Mill Ave in Tempe. The restaurant is nicely decorated and very clean. They have a fenced outdoor eating areas that is nice and it is per-friendly as long as your dog doesn't eat wait-staff...lol. The ordering system is efficient (counter service with a number on your table) but it can be tedious to wait in line on busy days. The food is very fresh looking and tastes great."}
{"text":"Excellent service and their coffee is amazing! Had the basic breakfast and came back the next day to get another espresso."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but I don't like how it is set up here. You have to stand in line for your food and then go sit back down for about half an hour for them to bring it to you. Need a refill of OJ while youre eating or waiting for your food? Sorry. Gotta get back in line . Its just inconvenient. I think they weren't expecting their business to be as busy as it is when they came up with this concept. This would have worked much better for a place that isnt so packed. I will still go back nonetheless. I just wish they would change that."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast place that's hopping.  Atmosphere is good and the food is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!  A friend and I decided to try something new for breakfast and we chose NCounter because it was close to where we were gonna be and it also had so many good reviews.  It turned out to be a great decision!

Service is fast because you don't have to wait for a server to bring you menus and take your order, you go right up to the counter and order off the menu they have displayed then they bring your food to your table once it's done.  A definite plus is that they do have a bar as well so if you want to order a Screwdriver with your breakfast, more power to you.  I definitely did!

Food itself is DELICIOUS!  I ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast and I was practically licking my plate at the end of it.  The flavors blended together perfectly and the portion size was good too.  Even the Screwdriver was made with fresh squeezed orange juice and you could tell."}
{"text":"The Food was good. the environment is lively. the one thing that really annoyed me is that me and my friend I was having brunch with ordered at the same exact time but they brought our dishes out at different times. so by the time my food arrived he had already finished eating."}
{"text":"Came here on my way to the airport and loved it! The food came out quickly and they got all of modifications correct. I had the burrito, my sister the Benedict, and my mom some kind of huevos rancheros we all shared an order of the wheat germ pancakes. I would recommend everything we got. The service was also great even though there was a line the man taking our order was patient and answered the questions. The girl who brought our foo offered us sharing plates for the pancakes. And someone even stopped by our table to ask if the temperature was ok and if we needed him to get us an umbrella! We had great food and didn't need to look around at all when we needed something! Definitely worth a shot if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered pancakes for my daughter, they were just okay. My sister got a bagel with sausage, egg, and cheese. Equally  mediocre."}
{"text":"Was on a bike ride around Tempe Town Lake with friends and saw this was the closest Breakfast spot. I didn't expect much from this place, but I was blown away. The restaurant is arranged nicely and open. It even has a bar and we ordered yummy Bloody Mary's. It is a nice casual atmosphere and service was prompt. I didn't really try any of the food, but friends ordered breakfast burrito and an some kind of omelet. There were no complaints. Cannot wait to go to this place again."}
{"text":"Hip, happening cafe with lots of delicious choices. Seriously the best chop salad the world over. I am thoroughly enjoying this unique blend of flavors: Arugula, cranberries, couscous, corn, feta, pecans. Who knew the combo would be yummy, but, it is delish. The menu is exciting & fresh. Love the bustling atmosphere but chill patio. 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Delicious! The breakfast menu has the perfect range of a classic breakfast to fun items!! Highly recommend the eggs any style and pancakes. Wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great brunch food, very delicious. They have lots of hot sandwiches, which look a bit small, but they were still quite filling. They have a nice patio seating area. There was a really long line to order, and on top of that, there was a really long line to get our food."}
{"text":"Came down here to meet up with friends who were in town. My friend says her sons always go here. Definitely come early. We got here at 10 am which was good.  Busy but atill a few tables. By 10:30 it was a long line and packed.  Got the bananas foster French toast.  It was good but a bit too sweet for me. My friends got the huevos and chorizo and the other got eggs Benedict.  They liked it.  Like that the have homemade pastries. Will be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Cute little counter cafe. You order at the counter and they bring your food to your table. I got the eggs Benedict and it was delicious  I also had their strawberry mimosa which hit the spot. Ncounter was quick, easy and tasty. Definitely recommend if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Poor customer service from the counter and my food didn't come out correctly. I work in a different restaurant with the same set up and this would be unacceptable."}
{"text":"My friends and I have come here twice now for Sunday morning brunch and have been delighted with anything we order! Most recently I chose the Huevos n' Chorizo sauté and LOVED IT!! I have never had an over easy egg cooked as perfect as the one I had here! Awesome service, amazing food, prime location in Downtown Phoenix, neat interior... I'm sure it will just be a matter of time before I'm back for more!"}
{"text":"The worst experience I have ever had. I was here with my colleagues for a lunch. My order was delayed to the point where everyone else was done with their food. I tried to get to the cashier wait staff for my order was asked to wait a couple of minutes which went for over half an hour. I had to rush back for my meetings so I asked them to just change it to a To-go order as anyways there was no point keeping everyone waiting for my food. And to my horror this what I got \" A burnt Sandwich \".

You should choose some other place and avoid NCounter on mill ave. There are better ones in and around the downtown area."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place but it does get crowded on weekends so come early!  I've been here about 4-5 times so far and just love it!  Mimosas are good and they have different varieties.  The side patio is nice. They have loose leaf tea freshly bagged and delicious smoothies. Yogurt and fruit is always good, but my favorite is the french toast.  You can get it with different sides, I think fruit, potatoes, or other options available.  Definitely the best breakfast spot in Tempe."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Good coffee too. I love the chop salad. Good little breakfast/ lunch spot."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast place.  The service was great and the food/drinks were delicious!  The plates actually looked like the pictures."}
{"text":"Visited this place after rave reviews, but honestly, I thought it was average.  Kinda pricey for not full-service, and mimosas and bloody Mary's were Scottsdale-priced (small and expensive).  Breakfast burrito was ok, but a little overly greasy.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to go to Ncounter, but if I was in the neighborhood, I would try it again."}
{"text":"Love this spot! It's always a battle between choosing here or First Watch, and Ncounter always conquers! It's a busy place, but can you blame them?! The red velvet waffles kill the waffle game. Ncounter will always be a top breakfast option for me."}
{"text":"One of the few breakfast places in Tempe, and thankfully it is fabulous.  The huevos n chorizo are amazing!!!!  Fast service, friendly staff.  Reasonably priced.  I recommend."}
{"text":"My first visit and I already know I'll be back for more!  

Ncounter is on the corner of Mill and 3rd.  Metered street parking is available, but I used the parking garage farther down 3rd- first hour is free.

Large space packed with staggered tables to allow people to walk by, but I found it a little tight, and I'm petite!  There's a partition wall/counter that held the soda fountain and other accoutrements, and beyond that, more two- and four-top tables.  Lots of light shining through from so many glass windows- love it!  Ceiling fans were going full-blast; I couldn't find a table that offered respite from the strong breezes.

Ordering food entails lining up at the counter- not my favorite thing to do, but the process went quickly after I decided what to order.  Staff was very helpful and took time to double-check ingredients info for me.  I ordered the banana walnut pancakes and the Grilled cheese \"Melt Down,\" with ciabatta bread instead of 12-grain (due to allergies).  Also ordered an iced mocha.

The banana walnut pancakes were delicious, and the pancakes had a nice texture! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ncounter-tempe?select=gpDF5uw_20j-D0gth23QLg#gpDF5uw_20j-D0gth23QLg  The bananas were a tad too ripe for my taste, but not too mushy I couldn't eat them, so I didn't complain.  I asked what kind of syrup it came with and was told \"artificial syrup,\" and was offered desert honey, which had great flavor and went well with the pancakes.  I liked that the walnuts were plain and not candied.  I will have to try other varieties, as I am not looking forward to eating very soft slices of banana here again.  The grilled cheese sandwich was exquisite! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ncounter-tempe?select=qCkmJETFCMlS7adhlkIR5Q#qCkmJETFCMlS7adhlkIR5Q  Five kinds of cheeses (jack, cheddar, Swiss, American, and cream), jalapeños, and bacon, with tomatoes omitted.  Ciabatta was toasted and had great textures (crunch/crusty on the outside and soft underneath).  The slices of jalapeño gave this sandwich just enough heat and tang-- I wish I was back at Ncounter having another sandwich just writing about it!  The potato chips were good enough to add crunch, but I could've done without.  Gives me yet another reason to return- to try other sides!  Such great comfort food, I kept two thirds of the sandwich to take home and enjoy later.  Mom tried a small portion and ended up eating most of the leftovers!  That says a lot-- the sandwich kept well AND Mom enjoyed it, and it's hard to impress her with anything, especially with leftovers!!  

The iced mocha was just OK.  A little watered down.  Hope I have better luck with other beverages next time, for there will be a next time... Mom has already requested more of the \"Melt Down\" for takeout.  :)"}
{"text":"Yay! Love this place. Great basic breakfast and even better coffee. Cool vibe. Waiter remembered us from the day before."}
{"text":"I've had this restaurant on my 'places to check out' list for quite a while now. I finally got there for lunch the other day, and was so disappointed that I decided to write a review. The ambiance was great, place was nice and clean...and there was plenty of cute ASU girls in there...but that wasn't enough to distract me from how awful the food was. I was under the impression that this was a good restaurant for light, healthy fare, but that really wasn't the case. For $12 I got a tuna melt and potato chips. The tuna was more like coleslaw, and there was so little of it that I probably could have stuffed the entire portion into a shot glass. The bread was soggy with grease and butter. There was so much liquid that I could have filled a cup and drank my lunch. Gross. I would have ordered something else, but the line was much too long and I had a limited amount of time. I actually ended up stopping at a place around the corner to pick up a 2nd meal that I could actually eat. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. My friend got the cobb sandwich and wasn't thrilled with his either. Maybe I'll try again with the breakfast."}
{"text":"Wonderful fit for Mill Ave considering there was no other breakfast option. Tables were close together and could be easily pushed together in the event you have an encounter (get it!) with a stranger and want to become better acquainted. The restaurant was well staffed with friendly people striking up conversations and answering questions. 
Plus the food was terrific. (It reminded me a lot of Local Breeze: fresh, local, healthy.) The coffee is local and comes from Press Coffee. Delicious and it comes with free refills. They also had a large assortment of baked goods and I'm pretty sure I saw someone with a mimosa. I welcome NCounter to Mill Ave and wish them nothing but the best."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast!! French toast with the honey butter was delicious and make sure you get a side order of their sausages!"}
{"text":"I apologize up front to the staff who may feel this review is a bit harsh, but the breakfast experience I just had on this beautiful Sunday morning was terrible at best. First off, the place is a disaster. Its a mad rush to secure a dirty table and the whole walk up and order thing is pure insanity. Second, the reps at the counter, and the reps walking around have zero clue what is going on and answer questions in a bothered tone. 

The \"drip\" coffee was out, the Splenda was out, and then when it was filled it was watered down and tasted awful. The food was overpriced and took 45 minutes to get. All in all, if you're visiting you should really just go to a better place like US Egg or Scramble. At least you get better food with a waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal fan of this place's sister location (TC Egginton's) for many years so I can't help but be a little in love. I'm not so much of a fan on the location itself as it's a little inconvenient for me so I don't get out often. The menu is where it's at for me. The food is creative and done well."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time. Great lunch and very decent breakfast although the one thing they need to offer is Almond and or coconut milk for coffee drinkers! If I wasn't such a coffee snob I would Probably offer a 4 or even a 5 star on this place but based on there limited milk alternatives I was super sad this AM. Big disappointment guys! Milk and Soy is not healthy!"}
{"text":"Came here on a lunch break with co-workers. Pretty damn good. I got the \"House Request\" sandwich. The chef definitely knows what's up when it comes to fried eggs in a sandwich. They were perfectly over medium. Regardless of looking plain, the side potatoes were tasty. My PB&J smoothie was really good too. My coworkers enjoyed their meals. We all agreed we'd definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to checking out this new restaurant. The restaurant has potential but some keys things are missing. The coffee is horrible, they really need to up their game!  The staff had no personality and barely acknowledged us the entire time we were there, friendliness was missing. The food was good, not amazing."}
{"text":"We came here because it's pet friendly ( outside patio only). Knocked down a star because no dog menu and didn't bring my doggy bowl of water when requested. Ordered unseasoned potatoes and scrambled eggs for the pup! Their chopped salad was really good. If I had to come back, I'd come for the salad. Breakfast wasn't bad..waffles with fruit and eggs Benedict (nothing special to remember) but the salad I'll remember. My Bloody Mary costed 9 bucks. It was ok. When I want a Bloody Mary, I expect all the olives and celery and bells n whistles. Other than that, it's a good simple breakfast place.

Service was ok. Don't expect a sit down and server checking up on you. You go in, order, take a number, and they bring your food. Guy at front who took my order was nice, the server who brought our meals out was cool."}
{"text":"Food came out cold after waiting forever for it. Since we already paid because they make you order and then sit and wait til the waiter/waitress brings out the food we couldn't just have them take it off the bill.  We told the waiter and he seemed confused on what to do. The manager came and said would bring us fresh pancakes. Mind u everything was cold or barely warm but he only said pancakes.  Anyway we thought they'd be right out. But no.  It took forever again. I had finished my food by the time the pancakes came out. At least this time it was hot. But we would have much rather just scrapped the whole thing because they weren't even that good. So disappointed. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Dishes are really fresh. They are big though, so bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Well not much on the lunch menu here really appeals to me so I don't think it will be in my regular rotation even though it is pretty close to my new job. However, I certainly don't mind having breakfast for lunch every once in a while. I had the French Toast today and it was awesome! As the other reviewers have said this place does get pretty crowded, though. Even though it was past noon and it is the summer so ASU is not in session, I still had no choice but to eat at the bar. Well, I guess I did have a choice, I could have sat outside but come on, its over 100 degrees out there!"}
{"text":"First time in, was pretty crowded, food was good. Great place to grab breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, a little of everything on the menu. You go up to the front, order food, find a table and then wait for your order to come. The food is good and it's not a bad place to come to for a quicker-than-a-sit-down-restaurant-bite."}
{"text":"Awesome little place I got to check out over the weekend. 

Let's just say I had a rough night the night before so I just ordered a hot tea haha. BUT...my friends ordered some breakfast/brunch and the food looked delicious. 

It has a great little atmosphere and they even serve Frosé!! 

Next time I'm in town I'll definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"I was going to be doing ambassador work for a rideshare company during the PF Changs race and hunger struck me. I decided to get breakfast here before I ventured over to the mill ave bridge.  Man was this place packed.  But I after receiving my breakfast, Farmers Market Benedict, I learned why it was crowded. 

My Farmers Market Benedict breakfast consisted of 2 poached eggs, spinach, tomato, avocado, and hollandaise sauce over and English muffin.  It came with a side of potatoes.   

English muffin slightly toasted.  The eggs were perfectly poached.  Slightly cooked whites, barely set.  Yolk the consistency of pudding. Yummy yolky eggy pudding. If yolks that are not that pudding consistency, and you shouldn't call it poached.  Again, these eggs were perfect.  The spinach and tomato were as they should be, spinach slightly cooked, and tomato raw.  The avocado, hollandaise sauce, and side of potatoes added the finishing touches to this fantastic breakfast. 

Seriously, just thinking about those eggs alone makes me want to go back this weekend."}
{"text":"I love me some Ncounter.  I have been a fan of the Tempe location since Jan 2017.  The fam was heading out for some errands in downtown phoenix and we wanted to treat ourselves to breakfast yesterday morning. I was worried that us getting there at 9am we'd be waiting forever, like we would be at the Tempe location, but we lucked out.  

Close parking is pretty nil as there is only the garage right there with limited spaces. Be sure to get your parking pass validated, unless you wanna pay $2 for that first hour.  (still kicking myself on that one.  I had the ticket with me and didn't get it validated. derp) Once you park, go back through where the garage gates are or else you'll be looped out onto Roosevelt. 

We head inside and order.  
I get my standard (cause I'm a creature of habit. I know what I want and like) - The Farmers Market Benedict. 
J - his standard - Red Velvet Waffles
C - Kids French Toast. 

C scarfed down his French toast and said, \"Mommy this is yummy!\" J of course loved his RV Waffles. My benedict kinda fell short. The potatoes as always were tasty though!  But the eggs were just short of hard cooked.  The manager made it right though, offering to have my food remade.  I just kindly asked if I could have 2 poached eggs.  The replacement eggs were perfect. 

I doubt we'll be back to this location though.  Not because of the food, but because of the patrons that bring in their pets (that are NOT service animals) inside the restaurant and the staff (the cashier in this instance) not doing anything about it while the customers were at the counter with their dog wiggling around in their arms. Extremely unsanitary. Standard rule of thumb for service dogs = 4 on the floor (unless they're performing a specific task)

Granted, I know it is a patio friendly establishment for dogs, but one person can stay with the dog outside on the patio (and there is an gate from the sidewalk granting access to the patio), while the other person goes inside and orders.  Don't be THAT pet owner.  And the cashier should have told them to take their pet outside. But she did nothing, except gush over the dog.  :/

If I could give a 1/2 star, I would give a 3.5 for this location."}
{"text":"Wow. If you want to go eat a good brunch this is where you go. Excellent food and good service"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch joint. It's clean, quick & efficient, and serves above average food. I usually go for their yogurt & granola or original chop salad...so good! Hubby gets a range of things and has never been disappointed. It gets packed for a reason, especially on weekends!"}
{"text":"Decided to get some brunch with my boyfriend and we're probably 1 out of 10 other people in the place and first in line when ordering our food. Obviously missing the rush because after sitting multiple people walked in, however a multitude of people that arrived after us were getting their food prior to us. We waited over 20 minutes where people who barely sat were getting their food before us. Asked multiple employees to check on our order and we're never gotten back to. We're honestly appalled at this level of customer service. Just received our food while writing this and it's cold? How can something that took 30 minutes be cold on arrival? A few bites in I could tell my French toast was extremely moist and didn't seem cooked through. Asked for the manager and it turns out the person that brought us the food was the manager! Why was nothing addressed? Why didn't we get an apology for the lengthy time we waited? Or any acknowledgement at all. He was rude and unapologetic. For a place that is usually fast paced with delicious food it sure seems they've taken a turn for the worst. Very disappointed with our food choice today"}
{"text":"Saw this on Fox 10 one morning and thought it looked good. My girlfriend is a celiac so finding breakfast places for her can be difficult, especially with places that sneak flower into eggs to make them fluffier (ihop). All of the omelets are gluten free (They do state that the kitchen is not gluten free so there is a chance of cross contamination) and are quite good. She had a cheese omelet with ham, I stuck with the plain and simple breakfast. 

The quality of the food was good, I found that while my bacon was properly cooked, it wasn't as warm as I would have liked it. The eggs were cooked well but the best part of the plate were the grilled potatoes! On top of that is this apple cinnamon jelly for the toast that is a must have. The omelet was almost too cheesy but good size and not super greasy. It also came with a side, she chose the fruit which was fresh. The portions were perfect for what you pay for, I was full but didn't have to unbutton my pants when I left, which is the worst part about most breakfast joints, it really slows down the rest of the day.

To top off our meals I chose a regular coffee which wasn't too strong but had a great flavor. I'm not sure how often they change it out, but it fresh enough for my taste. My girlfriend had a caramel latte, which was really good, very smooth and not as bitter as it's Starbucks' counterpart.

The atmosphere was modern, with lots of outdoor seating. We were there on a Wednesday morning so it was not crowded and were in and out with time left on the parking meter outside. I believe that going here on a weekend would be a different story, as I'm sure it could get quite crowded. I would suggest not sitting right next to the fence or you may get a visit from one of Mill Ave's locals asking for spare change.

We will be going again, I'd like to try some of their other menu items"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my coworkers around noon. I had the Mediterranean omelet that was rather tasteless. The potatoes on the side were very clearly frozen- not fresh at all. Some of my friends had sandwiches that looked pretty good and as I was looking around I noted some good looking French toast! 
It was not crowded at all when we arrived. They validate parking so be sure to ask!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time for a late breakfast and it was AWESOME! It was within walking distance of our hotel (AC Marriot) and right on the end of Mill Street. It is a walk-up counter to order and you can choose to sit inside or out. We got the chiliquilles and the chipotle breakfast burrito and both were beyond delicious. The cold brew coffee was also incredible and fresh! The only thing was the wait time for food- we sat for about 25 minutes after ordering without any food. But, it was very busy so I don't think it was only us. 

Will for sure be returning for breakfast possibly a few more times before the end of the trip!"}
{"text":"Great food and Service! Kid friendly and dog friendly. The Pecos Grill is my favorite sandwich. I crave it!"}
{"text":"Ncounter is always packed during the weekends and rightfully so. Really great brunch spot with a good variety of sweet and savory brunch options. My usual is the farmers market egg's Benedict. The eggs are always poached perfectly. 

Only complaints are the long wait time for food during high traffic hours, which is to be expected."}
{"text":"This is literally the best breakfast joint in Phoenix. I got the classic eggs Benedict and a waffle and it was sooo heavenly. The waffles are thick and warming and the eggs Benedict was fluffy and perfectly poached and filling. This is a 10/10 restaurant and I will be back every week!!! PS they have Mr Pibb"}
{"text":"If your looking for a breakfast place with lots of choices, healthy and non healthy this is the place to go! I have been more times than i can count and I have never been disappointed. If you go early in the morning the lines aren't long, and you beat the brunch crowd! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is pretty unassuming and I wasn't looking forward to coming here for lunch on my last day in Phoenix, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I had the grilled cheese with bacon. It's made with a yummy cream cheese spread and grilled to perfection. It's served with a salad and the serving sizes were just right. My belly was full, my tastebuds were satisfied and I can't wait to try making that grilled sandwich at home! 

Delicious. Perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"A friend of ours wanted to meet here for brunch. It was pretty packed on Sunday at 1030 but the line moved fast. I got the breakfast burrito. It was good and fresh, nothing spectacular.  They have both outdoor and indoor sitting. They ran out of americanos ? or they only had coffee at that time ..."}
{"text":"Mother's Day was a bad day to take friends. But everyone enjoyed their food. The wait wasn't as long for a table (considering like vultures we scoped out any where there was a family finishing up).  Everyone is always helpful and friendly. I can only say that this time my meal was slightly cold. I won't hold it against them, and not come back because previous visits have always been exceptional."}
{"text":"Great breakfast options and the help yourself coffee keeps you wide awake as you wait for your food.  This is not a quick Panera or Corner Bakery stop.  The food is very good, but it takes a while to make.  My standard benedict was pretty good and my daughter loved the HUGE fluffy choc chip pancakes.
My only issue is the lack of free parking and for that matter available parking on busy mornings.  Aside from those issues, the food is excellent and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This place makes me happy and has a little spot in my tummy. Located in downtown Tempe at the heart of it all Mill Ave this place is usually packed. I'm not going to go into all the reasons I enjoy this place there are too many but I will highlight a few things (1) You can order online and come pick it up (2) They have a great outdoor patio. My recommendations 

Breakfast- grilled wheat germ granola
Sandwich Hot- Portobellini
Sandwich Cold- smokehouse avocado stack
Salad- Original Chop (My FAVORITE SALAD) the presentation is colorful and beautiful, taste is scrumptious, and pesto dressing is amazing 

Only downfall is it closes at 3pm too early for me."}
{"text":"Breakfast!!! 

 It was crazy busy the morning me and another Yelper went to NCounter.  Long line so I was told to order at the bar, still a long wait, actually I think it was longer...therefore just stay in the line.  

I could've eaten the french toast AND Ncounter's Farmer's Market bene (2 eggs poached, spinach, tomato, avocado, hollandaise sauce and potatoes). Delicious!  The Farmer's Market bene that is!  I will have to go back for the french toast.  I also had ordered a mimosa.  More alcohol please next time."}
{"text":"This is my fav breakfast place on Mill avenue. High quality fresh food."}
{"text":"Came here since we were in Tempe down the street from Mill.

It has a trendy atmosphere; clean, cement floors, wooden tables, bare but with large, interesting art pieces. Inside was spacious and clean. Service was friendly. You order at a counter, seat yourself, and they'll bring your food out when it's ready.

We both ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict. Both meals were wonderful. Thick slices of ham, eggs cooked perfectly, and the hollandaise sauce was perfectly seasoned. Fried potatoes came with the eggs and they tasted so good they didn't need any seasoning or ketchup, etc...

Our experience was great! We'd definitely come back when we're nearby."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely phenomenal! Walking in, the place looked very inviting with a brightly lit open space and outdoor patio. I ordered the farmers market benny and a blueberry smoothie. The eggs benedict may be the best benny I have had so far and definitely competes with Butterfields and Butters, (places I frequent). The smoothie was also great, but after a look at the cocktail menu, I was wishing I had ordered a mimosa from their line of delicious looking mimosa choices! I will definitely be back! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor seating area, very dog friendly. Don't sit in the back of the outdoor seating area because it smells like propane back there. Had some coffee and just hung out for a couple of hours. It was a pleasant experience. Didn't order food this time but next time I will, because every dish that came by looked magnificent! All of the prices on the menu looked very reasonable for the portion."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and fast which is a big bonus for the Mill lunch crowd. I ordered at the counter and had my food within 10 minutes. The tropical Iced Tea was delicious and so was my salad. I ordered the Chop, it had arugula, cranberries, corn, feta, red pepper, chicken and couscous (loved the couscous) and a slightly sweet and creamy basil pesto dressing.

I felt so good about my healthy lunch I splurged and split a chocolate cupcake with Georgie. It was moist and not overly sweet, I detected a faint hint of coffee in the icing. 

I will definately be back.."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with my meal here. I got the chop salad, which had nice, neat little rows of all the ingredients. There was a layer of lettuce on the bottom, with a row of corn, feta, chicken, cranberries, pecans, and whatever else was in it on top. I had the dressing on the side and mixed it all together and it worked out great. My friend had the chilaquiles which she always gets and she's Mexican, so I have a feeling they're pretty good here. She's a picky eater, lol. Overall it was fresh and healthy, so it hits the mark for me!"}
{"text":"The low reviews so far are interesting. My husband and I stopped in for breakfast this past Saturday and had a great first visit! Were we just lucky? Or do the rest of you not know what the hell you're talking about? ;)

I had the Killer breakfast sandwich (minus bacon), with \"almost\" hard fried eggs, Gorgonzola (fav), and tomatoes on ciabatta. The almost hard is how I try to make eggs at home, so that was a personal plus. It was delicious, and the side of potatoes was freaking great. I'm not the hugest breakfast potatoes fan, but they were seasoned really well. My husband tried a spinach/avo/tomato benedict along with a single banana pancake. The pancake was crazy fluffy and not only topped with bananas, but they were packed inside as well. Super yum.

The iced coffee was delish, although $5 per seemed a little steep. All in all, this is a great addition to the area. Welcome north, Ncounter!"}
{"text":"Nitro cold brew, decent croque madame was decent. Just passing through, it's a college kid day after place, nice ambiance."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast, and it was amazing!  The environment was cozy, modern, and friendly.  We ordered at the counter, and the food was brought to our table in about 10-15 minutes.  The food was totally amazing!!!  Perfect portion sizes, perfect prices, perfect taste!  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Had the cheese omelette and added sausage to it. Ordered a side of oatmeal and a banana and strawberry smoothie. The omelette was good, the potatoes were delicious, the smoothie a little bitter and the oatmeal was just right. Overall, I liked the food. Definitely made with fresh ingredients. If I'm ever in town again, I'll try the pancakes. They look delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Dog owners, they allow behaved beasts of all sizes on the patio. For me, this is the best selling point.

I've had a ton of dishes here, including pancakes, french toast, omelettes, sandwiches--probably 10+ meals. I've only come here for breakfast and I think they aren't open past the late afternoon.

How it works is you walk up to the counter, order your food, and pay/tip right away. They'll give you a metal table number and if you ordered a hot or alcoholic drink, they will attach a laundry clip to it so the bartender can find you more easily. I recommend their mimosa or bloody mary. Great iced and hot teas, as well. Come here before/after a walk on Tempe Town Lake."}
{"text":"They forgot about us :-(. This has happened several times before! People around that were after us have their food and I ordered the same thing!!! Very annoying!!"}
{"text":"Ncounter has the feel of an upscale urban diner. You can get all the breakfast classics but with a show of respect for quality and well-balanced flavor. The prices are reasonable and the environment is casual and inviting, if not a little cramped. Why the 4 star? It was great but it was nothing to write home about. They've taken a good, solid concept (i.e. diner fare) and delivered on it."}
{"text":"This place is cute, lots of options. However it does advertise itself to be on the healthy side and I didn't think it was very healthy. I had the veggie omelet that was soaked in grease. 

-very very busy
-semi-self serve
-Lots of seating (inside and out)
-lots of college kids
-noisy
-good for groups
-great for people watching"}
{"text":"I recently had breakfast here on a Saturday with my family.

There is a children's menu- it's just not posted on their menu board.

Delicious menu options- we were all happy with our food.

The food took a long time. A Really, really long time. It was very busy but I get hangry and hangriness leads to one less star.


One thing to note- there is only cold brew. I am not a fan of cold brew so I assumed if I ordered iced coffee that is what I was getting. I barely drank it because it's not my thing. No almond milk or non dairy creamer on the coffee fixins area- unless I missed it.

Great ambiance- I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast joint near DT Phoenix. I love the whole order first then grab a seat concept. (My personal preference, actually). I also love how employees still provide excellent service after you've ordered and paid. All in all, tasty food. Fresh interior decor. Chill vibes. A+ customer service. A solid 4 star Ncounter."}
{"text":"Right across the street from work so this was a breakfast option.

Pretty extensive menu for breakfast. I got the classic egg's benedict. Can't go wrong with this. Pretty filling. I was expecting fresh potatoes, but hey, the fried cubed ones work as well.

The co-workers enjoyed their omelettes as well."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome gluten free breakfast choices including waffles and muffins. Must come again."}
{"text":"So i got banana foster french toast and i was really looking forward to loving it seems how everyone said it was good here on yelp. I dont know what french toast they had but mine was disgusting. The sauce was so slimey it didnt even stick to my french toast or soak in it just layed on top of it.. i LOVE Bananas foster and this was NOT bananas foster..

Not to be graphic here but the sauce was almost like snot. Slimey and wouldnt pull away from the fork. I had to cut it. Let me repeat. I had to CUT sauce.. 

I took it up with an employee who just seemed to not care and acted like i didnt know what i was saying.
I then took it to the front and asked for something else. The manager i believe exchanged my meal for something else. I ended up with the breakfast burrito and it was amazing. The potatos were also amazing. Would i be back? Its very unlikely."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with friends for the Downtown Tempe Brunch Crawl, and it was very crowded. I don't think the food was anything too special.

SERVICE: SLOW. In their defense the place was pretty packed but all the dishes came out at separate times :( 

AMBIENCE: indoor and outdoor seating though be careful with outdoors because it is HOT in the summer and very few shaded areas 

FOOD: for the brunch crawl there were $3 bloody Mary's, $3 bloody Maria's, and $3 breakfast tacos. We got an assortment. The food was good but nothing huge to write home over and the tacos were tasty but nothing too special."}
{"text":"This place has great food & drinks but I wouldn't order an espresso / coffee drink again. The dirty chai latte I ordered tasted like pure syrup. I have a giant sweet tooth but this was disgustingly sweet. I couldn't taste any coffee flavor because the syrup was so overpowering. I couldn't even drink more than a few sips of it, what a waste of money! I would just stick to the alcoholic beverages next time because their barista services are lacking. Really disappointed"}
{"text":"The decor is more of a fast casual however food was surprisingly good. I had the Huevos and Chorizo and it was very tasty. I tried my friends red velvet waffles was also especially good. Yummy! You order in the front and they take the food to the table.

The coffee was ok."}
{"text":"Perfect patio!! You can't go wrong with the Benedicts (we had one regular and one farmers') and Red Velvet Waffles! The coffee was good, the staff was friendly and the prices were reasonable. Well worth the 10 minute wait!"}
{"text":"GR8 place for breakfast. Location, menu choices, and taste of food were all good. Costs was a little high for time of day, other than that would go back for the french toast and turkey sausage."}
{"text":"The best breakfast spot in tempe. Husband and I come for breakfast couple times a month. Food is always great service fast and friendly. Neat location on mill ave."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for the first time, and I had a really nice breakfast.  

Had the Farmer's Market, pretty much a play on egg's benedict but with avocado and spinach, so like egg's florentine with avocado? yeah?  The potatey's weren't piping hot, which doesn't bother me at all...I'd actually prefer them not to be.  It reminded me of my dad though, something he'd be all pissy about and want to send back to warm up....So if you're bringing a friend like that there, beware.  The potatoes were really good though, they weren't all greasy and diner tasting, they were as healthy as potatoes can get maybe? The farmer's market was awesome though, not greasy, really light, lots of flavor, and a pretty presentation.  The hollandiase sauce was the perfect consistently, not too thick, and definitely not too thin, and not drenched all over the place. The english muffin was the perfect texture..I hate when it's a hard muffin and you can't cut it, that's the worst. And lots of avocado... thank you!  People can be so stingy with the avocado....feelin' you guys! The farmer's market paired with my bellini, a cutie patio, my friends and the shins playing?  I'd say we did pretty good.





Speaking of my bellini, it was really refreshing, and mostly champagne...feelin' you again Ncounter/ bartender!  When it was dropped off she actually said, \"lots of champagne in this one\"...I was definitely not mad about that.  And what I thought was fruit inside of it, was actually a peach o ring, like that!  And I ate it at the end, definitely a champagne ring, new fav? 






My friends got the eggs benedict, the fruit and granola, some of their toast with their signature (not vignature...vig regulars what's up?) cinnamon apple jam? I think that's what type of jam it was..whatever type of jam, it was delish.  





My friends also really liked their food and the overall ambiance of a place seemingly reminiscent to LGO but over in the Tempe area.   Speaking of LGO...Ncounter's food I think is better than LGO's.  There are very few things at LGO that have blown my mind, it's just nice to go there, because it's super cute, a nice neighborhood, something for everyone, picnic tables...you know why we all like it.  Realistically I love going to LGO, because it's always a lovely time with my friends.  BUT I think Ncounter offered an awesome brunch with my friends, and the food was better.  







Ncounter will definitely be a new regs place for us... in fact I'll be back today? The salads that went by looked amazing.    






Last thing that needs to be said....GET THE PUMPKIN COOKIE.  Holy fricken mother, I think we all died and went to heaven eating that cookie.  I am not even kidding... if those were around me everyday...easily the fast track to morbid obesity.  This being said, you should defs give Ncounter a try."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for brunch! Suits well for college students because you seat yourself and order at the front then they bring the food out to you! I got the chipotle burrito, pear omelette, and strawberry waffles. All pretty good but nothing extravagant about it. 

Parking around University is not that great so I wouldn't recommend it to the normal foodie. Like I said, it's more for college students just roaming around campus and stuff"}
{"text":"Modern places like this are in short supply in Tempe/Phx, so it is great for a quick brunch.

The best part is that the parking is right  next door and the service is not crappy. Thought 2 out of the 5 times they were late, probably cz they forgot about our order. Try the chicken Focaccia sandwich with salad, it is healthy anad filling. Love the French Toast as well as the Chicken salad as well. 

A good brunch option to check out in Tempe."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTLY AMAZING!!! I try to come here before every home game I attend. The food is great and so is the staff. They are incredibly accommodating and the best part is we can sit on the patio with our dog."}
{"text":"i like the home fries here!

they know how to make a proper eggs benedict!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast or lunch!!! Great vibe and staff!! It was perfect after a hike at A mountain as it is right there. Love the outside or inside seating as well as dog friendly restaurant!!! Ordered the steel cut oatmeal with fresh berries! So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Came in today for breakfast with my family.  Arrived at 10:15.  Line wasn't very long and we were able to order within a few minutes.  However, we did not receive our food until 35 mins later - way too long.  My eggs and turkey sausage were cold.  Not happy - this place is not worth the wait.  Might have been okay if my food wasn't cold -yuk."}
{"text":"Gluten-free boyfriend and I come here frequently and love it. It's one of the few places we can both get breakfast in the area. 
Delicious food. 
Only downsides are that it is always packed and parking sucks, but that's Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a weekday. Ordered the french toast with strawberries and the build your own breakfast sandwich. The french toast was fluffy, light, and very fulfilling! For the build your own sandwich, you have different options for types of meat, cheese, egg, bread, vegetables, and a side of your choice. I enjoyed my sandwich and loved being able to pick and choose from many options.

This place is self seating. When we got there at 9:30 am, there was no line and just a quick 10 min wait for the food. There's metered parking right in front of the restaurant. This was a good first experience and I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Ncounter is the hip and happening place to be at lunchtime on Mill Ave. 

I had the chance to try this place a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised by the vast options on their menu and the quality of food. Everything on the menu looked enticing, but I ended up going with the bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado sandwich with a side salad. I placed my order and took my number to the table to wait for my yummy lunch to arrive. Once it finally did (it did take a while but they were slammed due to popular demand) my tastebuds jumped for joy with the flavors of a regular blt mixed with the egg salad (who would have thought?!?). The mixed green salad was nothing special, but it didn't need to be. Next time I won't be so healthy and I'll go with chips or something fried! Other menu items I'll be back to try will be their breakfasts...oh my goodness they sounded good. 

The environment at Ncounter is very busy, but it isn't overwhelming. Despite it being crowded they have a good system so that the ordering line goes quickly, there are clean tables and seats available for everyone, and the process is comfortable for all who walk in the door. The staff is very friendly and all seemed to be working hard to make everything run like clockwork. 

Ncounter is a top notch lunch or breakfast spot for anyone who wants a solid meal (with both inside he box and outside the box flavors) at a reasonable price. If you are hungry on Mill Ave give them a whirl!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast joint, one of favorites in the valley. I drive from Gilbert to go here. Great prices and GREAT food."}
{"text":"We had to drop our roommate off at the airport so we just yelped places around.  So glad I came across this gem.  You order first then seat yourselves, didn't seem overcrowded which was awesome because seats popped open.  We got the omelette and chipotle bacon burrito.  

Omelette- I'm super pickey with eggs.. this was SO good! Everything from the eggs to cheese to veggies were perfect.  I got wheat bread which sometimes can be grainy and dry, it was super moist and tasted great with the omelette, couldnt be happier.  

Chipotle bacon burrito- Awesome burrito the chipotle sauce complimented the dish so well and the tortilla was so soft.  

A bit on the oily side but its ok, its breakfast! 

Definately want to come back to try the eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Great breakfast in a cute little spot. We sat on the patio since the weather was great. Place is a bit cramped but worth it. Loved that it's dog friendly."}
{"text":"Had the bananas foster French toast and it was excellent. Good coffee, cute place and staff was nice."}
{"text":"Very cool and hip place on mill avenue. I like that you can order at the counter and find your own seats after. 

The food is good and the presentation is even better. I was really impressed about how they presented it! I got the red velvet waffles and I was not disappointed! 

My only negative is that this place gets really crowded and it might be hard to find seats. I would avoid going here on a Sunday morning/afternoon."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for Saturday or Sunday brunch.  I really love the food here, and the fact that we don't have to wait for someone to serve us.  The patio is great and Dog friendly right on Mill ave.  Great people watching as well.  It's a bit crowded on the weekends though."}
{"text":"Causal atmosphere that is welcoming and good food that is organic and fairly healthy."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Loved every bite of my fusion chicken salad and all my other lunch dates were more than pleased with their meals. Just dont be fooled by the \"brunch\" title. This isn't a cute little sit down where you can loyter for hours with girl friends. It's located right near ASU and so is pact with college students, super crowded-a bit like an upscale cafeteria. Nonetheless, very dainty and chill. Food is worth it I guess"}
{"text":"The food came quick for a busy day. I ordered the chipotle egg burrito which was delicious! Disappointed in their salsa though, it was pretty horrible, tasted vaguely like marinara and was served hot?? They should change that. Luckily they had Cholula. Hubby got waffles- crispy and tasty.  The bacon was flimsy and fatty though, needed to be cooked longer. You could probably just order it crispy next time."}
{"text":"There turkey pesto sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The atmosphere is really laid back. Went there for Easter and had some amazing banana foster french toast and their bacon was cooked to perfection. My sister said her yogurt granola was some of the best she has ever had."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Tempe with great patio views of the Hill and hot ASU girls walking by. I had the chorizo breakfast and it was really good and not as oily as most. Also the price is really good and under $8 for most plates. It is great concept even with the extreme busyness they had on a Sunday morning. I wish for breakfast spots were a hybrid sit down fast food spot. My friend says I need to come back for the farmers benedict so I will return."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the food here. It's always delicious. And you have to try the red velvet waffle."}
{"text":"This is going to be interesting. If it was only the look, I'd give it 4 stars for being beautiful. It's a fun-USA-Anywhere kinda place. I'd give it 5 stars except the blueberry muffins we had were so dry and forgettable. The coffee stands out - I asked- turns out its Cartel so that's a big plus.  (Shoutout to buddy and Cartel roaster, Daniel Noffsinger)
But this is going to be interesting. I saw OSB (muffins were better), Red Hut and recently People Pizza Pub Start and stall with the slick Tempe franchise feel. Roosevelt Row is so unique with an unique culture. But there are indeed hundreds of new people, unrelated to Roosevelt-Arts history moving downtown.  
Breakfast spot? 
Vovomina , Matt's Big Breakfast and Phoenix Public Market are within walking distance. 
RoRo not spoken here. So we'll see."}
{"text":"We were here for breakfast/brunch. The whole set up is confusing with people crowding by the counter with their heads up thinking of what to order. It's hard to grasp the menu on the fly and none of us ended up with meals we anticipated of having. The counter girl was conceding and not very helpful. Finally, after ordering, we got seated. The food came, but no utensils. By the time we got utensils, the food was cold. Service is below average, the food is average, ambiance is unremarkable."}
{"text":"I had lunch here about a year ago and finally got around to trying breakfast this weekend. When I arrived, the line looked really long, but it went surprisingly fast. I ordered the Hot Juan--an omelette with chorizo, cheese, and salsa, and my boyfriend ordered the blueberry pancakes with a side of sausage. My boyfriend also ordered a milk and was disappointed to find they don't actually serve you a glass of milk, but instead, they have those little Shamrock bottles. I went with the iced tea, and while the jasmine green tea was delicious, the passion tea tastes like Robutussin.

Our meal took about 20 minutes to come out. I think they might have lost our order because I notice people who sat after us got their orders first. Anywho, my omelette was good, but it was a bit too heavy on the cheese and salsa and didn't have enough chorizo. The side of potatoes that came with the omelette were amazing! I would definitely get those again. The blueberry pancakes and sausage were delicious, and even though I am a more savory breakfast person, I might order that next time.

The one thing I really disliked about breakfast is they had loud club type music playing the whole time. I know it's on Mill, but you would think they would make a different choice in music. And then in the midst of all the club music, some sad Bruno Mars song came on...it was weird.

I would have given this place 3 stars based on breakfast alone, but when I had lunch here, it was perfect! I highly recommend the Original Dagwood- turkey sandwich with havarti. The vibe was also a lot more relaxed at lunch (aka I didn't feel like I was at a club)."}
{"text":"Great food! Only downside is that it is always busy! It can be challenging to get a table, but worth the wait if you have the time."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday early afternoon which I knew going in would be the busiest time to be in there so I kind of braced myself for that. So I wasn't too shocked to show up and find it to be a madhouse, they definitely have put as many tables as possible in here. I feel at some point if a place gets this busy they need to find a way to better secure tables for people who are actually eating their food. I watched at least 4 tables be taken by people who just wandered in off the street and didn't order a thing. 

Aside from the pure insanity, the food was pretty good. It was decently priced, they gave out fair portion sizes. The staff was as attentive as you can be with how busy they were. I had no negative Ncounters (get it?) with staff so that was a plus. Overall a good experience with good food. 

I'm not one for big crowds generally so I don't see myself coming back in the future. But if you want a trendy Brunch spot on mill this is a good bet.."}
{"text":"We came for a late brunch on Saturday and the food was delicious! We ordered the classic benny, ultimate BLT, and pecos grilled chicken sandwich, and each person loved their food. I tried a bite of everything and it was all very tasty. I'm glad we came here on a whim and will probably be back."}
{"text":"Good selection on the menu,  food is yummy,  and fair priced. Can be quite busy sometimes,  mainly when classes are in session,  but overall good place to get breakfast in downtown Tempe area."}
{"text":"The bananas foster French toast was delicious but my favorite was the pear omelette! I would have never thought that the combo of pear, cheese, bacon, almonds &  eggs would work. It would have received 5 stars if it didn't take them about 20 minutes to bring out my food when it wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"First time at Ncounter and seemed super popular if the line indicated anything! You stan walk up and order your good, get a letter, and they bring it out to you. The restaurant was clean and they ran it smoothly. 

The food was super tasty and all I had was a salad and a cup of soup!! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"So fresh and delicious and affordable. Very worth a trip to down town mill and the terrible parking (parking on the street is free before 11 btw)"}
{"text":"Bananas Foster French Toast is the bomb!  Split the plate with a friend today - it was great to share... but I really wanted my own in the end!  ;)  The sauce on the toast was sweet without being too sugary.  
i love their iced coffee!  great spot for breakfast!

They have a walk up counter for ordering, makes it pretty quick!"}
{"text":"Do you even go to ASU if you have eaten at Ncounter a shameful amount of times??? I've probably tried most of their menu and I gotta tell you... It really is all so good. #1 in my heart is always gonna be the loaded omelet but since that's a very aggressive breakfast I usually just get the simple two eggs, sourdough, and sausage or bacon with potatoes. The most perfect breakfast potatoes you've ever had!! And for lunch you must get the chicken focaccia sandwich! Staff is always so nice and food comes out in a timely manner :) love you Ncounter"}
{"text":"Everything looked so Good and everyone in my party of 12 liked their meals as well.  It was very busy, but that's a good thing so if you made it later in the morning it would be a little calmer"}
{"text":"I ate here last Sunday and we placed
Our order and were served in a timely manner. My friend ordered the huevos ranchero.rdered the farmers market eggs Benedict with a side of
Canadian bacon. After trying different eggs Benedict at different restaurants across different cities, I was sad to say this wasn't the best I've tried. The hollandaise sauce was overpowering and very thick. The avocado was past its peak of ripeness and the tomato lacked succulence. I did however enjoy my cup of vanilla latte. I had the chance to try the huevos ranchero and it was mediocre at best. I would come here again but wouldn't order what I go ever again. I did like the atmosphere and loved the outdoor seating.

I also loved the way and ease of ordering. The servers were quick to give us our food and even if it was crowded their service was top notch."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I had the grilled cheese sandwich and it was amazing, maybe one of the best i have ever had! The girls are awesome that work here. Good place to cure a hangover or keep the party going."}
{"text":"Awful,people are rude.  Food and coffee are not good. They were rude to people at phx film festival. Food is not cooked all the way.  Review is true, correct the problem DoNotAttack Reviewer"}
{"text":"Blown away by the food and atmosphere of the place. I hate finding parking on Mill, but will definitely make another trip back to this place. The potatoes were DELICIOUS. They looked sort of plain, but they made up in flavor and taste. I like these potatoes more then Snooze hash browns 

Highly Recommend:
-Chipotle Burrito 
-Red velvet waffles"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Ncounter and I was disappointed. I love biscuits and gravy and they only offer it on Saturdays so I was really looking forward to trying it. The biscuit was okay but the gravy was Bland and the sausage tasted like Frozen sausage crumbles. There was also a bone in my gravy. The coffee was just okay the only thing that was actually good was the bacon. The cashier was friendly but the rest of the staff seem pretty indifferent. I could have spent $6 at Denny's for the same quality of food that I paid $12 at Ncounter. Since I haven't tried anything else here I don't want to give a negative recommendation but I wouldn't spend money in this place again."}
{"text":"This was a decent place for breakfast. It's defiantly a college town type of place. If you are looking for somewhere more sophisticated, I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I visited Ncounter this morning on the suggestion of some article about the \"Top 10\" places to enjoy breakfast in Tempe. To this restaurant's immense credit, they advertise very well with beautiful pictures, a simple but sleek interior, and great customer service.

On the suggestion of the cashier (which was a good suggestion, I might add), I ordered the pear omelet. It's an interesting but truly workable flavor combo of sliced peers and bacon with a side of potatoes. That beings said: 

- Food was unacceptably dry. There are two possibilities as to why: either the chef overcooked my meal, or my meal had been left out for a bit longer than it should have been, which leads me to my next thing 
- Long wait time. I went at 7:30 AM; there were about 8 other customers there, most of whom had already been served. My wait time was over 20 minutes, which was probably not necessary. 
- Coffee was not good. If you prefer simple, drip, black coffee like I do, you're better off getting it from elsewhere. Always be wary about the self-serve containers. No thermal container adequately masks how long ago a coffee was made, and mine was way too sour. They do have a nice menu of specialty coffee drinks which may be more worthwhile. 

I'm disappointed because this place, as I said earlier, advertises very well. Looks can obviously be misleading. However, I am open to coming back another time to give them another shot. Perhaps I'll try their Eggs Benedict next time. Until then, I shall......Ncounter other places (sorry, couldn't resist)."}
{"text":"Busy restaurant but the long line to order went thru really fast. Everything I saw come out looked amazing and the smells very even better! Loved gluten free waffles and yogurt with fresh fruit and granola. Looking forward to next time!!"}
{"text":"This place is super casual, you order at the counter. But because of that the prices are cheap and they have some good cocktails and a good super casual quick bite atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This location is by far better then the Tempe one. The food here seems fresher and staff were nice and attentive. It was a rather dead Monday, only one other couple in the restaurant. The girl working the bar was accommodating and attentive. I got the French toast with bananas (it was so good), boyfriend got a scramble and his mom got a blue berry waffle which she also said she liked. I think prices are on the cheap side, which is nice for a change considering the generous portion. I think once people get more knowledge of the location there and the apartments above fill up this place will be more of a hit."}
{"text":"I wanted this to be so good. Food is not cooked well.  You can tell it is all frozen and has that kind of aftertaste.  It also took a long time, 10 minutes for food to come out and it was empty.  Then when I got the food the eggs had been way over cooked. 

Not ben sure why I gave them 2 stars. Good cappuccino."}
{"text":"Liked the menu but maybe not as good as it sounds.  I tried the ncounter omelette with chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, cream cheese and hollandaise sauce. Filling yes but could use a few key improvements.

The tomato on top looks nice but makes for a soggy warm tomato mess. Partially steamed tomatoes can be eliminated from the world without much changing. I am certain that the broccoli was previously frozen. I know some may say picky but why not opt for fresh broccoli? A little cheaper despite a little more prep work for the staff.  (You can tell previously frozen broccoli from the texture and water that is folded into the omelette.)  

The potatoes were meh. The generous seasoning sprinkled on them tried to mask the deep fried-then put on the grill to reheat look and texture. Same as the broccoli, why not up your game and make fresh potatoes?

The eggs were fluffy and the hollandaise was standard for a packaged hollandaise. Just add butter right?

I will give this place (or perhaps an encounter and the other ncounter in Tempe) another chance as the chipotle egg burrito sounds like a winner despite having those same pesky potatoes."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Somewhat limited menu, but there is a good variety to choose from. Order at the register and seat yourself. It was pretty crowded here on a Sunday morning, but there was enough seating (especially on the outside patio), that there wasn't much issue finding a seat. My girlfriend and I both had the red velvet waffles here and they were great. Although, they were sweet enough with the frosting that we didn't use any of the maple syrup they came with. The turkey sausage was also a good side - although it was actually 3 patties, rather than a sausage link. Overall, it's a nice casual place for brunch right on Mill Ave; just make sure to get here outside of peak hours if it's hot outside and you want to find a seat indoors."}
{"text":"I've come here on two separate occasions and probably won't be coming back again. The first time I had one of their hot sandwiches, and it was absolutely drowning in grease - I used up 5 napkins just wiping down my fingers - and the chicken inside wasn't very warm. Overall, really bad.

Next time, I thought I'd try a breakfast item instead and ordered the French toast. What I got were two gigantic pieces of bread, one of which was an end (all crust --- really?) and it tasted bad. Either the bread was old, or one of the ingredients to make it wasn't fresh, because it had a strange flavor to it. 

The only good I tried here were the sides (grilled potatoes and sausage patties). The interior is also nice and modern. Otherwise, I would stay far away from this place until they learn to make food that tastes good and doesn't seem old, flavorless, and isn't drowning in grease."}
{"text":"We used to like this place when mimosas and bloody mary's were $5, now they are $8 and $9 respectivly and served in plastic glasses, yikes!! The garnish on the bloody was a lime, no celery, olive or asparagus ! There is a frozen rose for $9. as well. Really? The cheap drinks were the reason we were willing to put up with the counter ordering system, which is dumb because there are 10 servers milling around, why not just take orders? It's not formal enough to take out of town guests, but not cheap either. We enjoyed the food last time, but didn't stay this time because of the hefty drink prices in plastic cups. The bar and service staff was very friendly and inviting, so if you don't want to get your drink on, go here!!!!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite breakfast places in Tempe! It comes across as high-end, but casual at the same time. Whether you're a sweets for breakfast person, or are more a fan of the savory omelet, eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy side of the aisle, Ncounter does it all very well. They also offer a variety of well-done breakfast cocktails like mimosa, greyhounds, and bloody marys. So far I have not been disappointed by anything I've tried here.

The omelets I've had here have been incredibly fresh, all the ingredients certainly chopped/cooked on the spot. They have so many options when it comes to additions that I'm certain anyone can find something they'll like. Ncounter can get pretty creative, I personally appreciate the Greek and pear omelets, as well as the variety of eggs benedict combinations.

I've also tried the french toast and it was very fluffy, perfectly fried. Also, the french toast was huge portion-wise. I'm not sure how they do it, if they just have giant loaves of homemade bread or what but it works.

Ncounter is upscale on the inside, but carries a laid-back vibe. You order at the counter, are given a number, and its up to you to find a table to have your food delivered to. This can be one of the only downsides (though a good problem for them to have) is that finding a table on a weekend can be pretty challenging. They do have misters on the patio but in the heat of summer they only help so much. 

Overall, Ncounter is great place for breakfast/brunch on the weekend, especially with their extensive cocktail selection if you're into that. For what you get, it's not much more expensive than any other decent breakfast place in town however I don't see it being the best place for families/kids. Breakfast is going to run you $10 per person, $15ish if you get a mimosa or something like that but I can sincerely say the quality is well worth it, you won't be disappointed. Get there early enough to hunt down a decent table and you're golden. I wouldn't recommend the patio after 10/11 in the summer."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time coming here, but I was definitely impressed with the food this time. Ordered the Greek omelet, which I have gotten before but was so much better now, and the red velvet waffles. Everything was so good, nice outdoor seating, will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I would apologize for any color I may have left on your counters, walls or chairs.  I stumbled into this location after doing the Color Run.  This is such a cute new eatery.  After ordering, me and my friends could not stop drooling over all the plates that were coming out.  Everything looked AMAZING!!!  I decided to try the Pear Omelet and I was not disappointed.   Pear, Havarti cheese, and almonds.....so delicious! My friends were raving about their dishes.  Great location and awesome service!  I can't wait to go back to try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"Nice spot, cool decorating.  I had a chicken sandwich on focaccia bread and I felt like the bread was really too thin, it couldnt hold up.  Great flavors though, and still worth checking out for sure.  A nice addition to Mill ave."}
{"text":"I love coming to NCounter! Truly one of the best places for breakfast in the area. I've dined here at various times with a large group, by myself, and with a few friends. So it appears that the place never settles down and is always busy no matter the time of day nor season.

Food is amazing! I never know what to order because it's an extensive list and everything sounds tasty. Then I have to ponder the drink menu- mimosa? smoothie? Cartel cold brew? Hair-pulling decisions to make! The last few times I've ordered an omelette plate with potatoes, just love the simplicity of it. Friends also have noted love for their breakfast burrito and smoothies! They have a fairly simple bar menu for those who need a drink with brunch. The mimosas I've had are nothing special, almost too much OJ and not enough champs. 

Their people are great too. Anytime I walk up to order it's always been with a smile and a pleasant non-fake greeting. Recently the only free table was slightly dirty, but the manager came by to clean it up and apologized for not being quick enough. 

Definitely worth the time and money to visit here!"}
{"text":"Yummy OJ and delicious bacon! French toast had potential but wasn't cooked all the way. Eggs over easy were perfect!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after an overnight shift and was curious to try this place.  I ordered the chipotle breakfast burrito, cup of cold brew coffee and a turkey/bacon/avocado sandwich.  The food honestly was a let down in that the burrito and sandwich just lacked flavor straight up.  The presentations were nice, service was good but the star of the show (the food) just didn't show up.  I ended up dousing my burrito with hot sauce to get some kick and flavor.  The sandwich was over priced for what it is.  The cold brew just tasted like water."}
{"text":"Not everything on the menu is great (pancakes and burrito), but something are very tasty.  Best time to come is on the weekdays or when they first open, it's hard to find a seat on a weekend period.  

They have issues with their food and coffee being consistent from day but over time I've been satisfied enough.

Again, come early!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place to go to and I've never had a bad experience till today. And it was 100% the worst food service experience i've ever had!! i came here on a Friday morning during winter break thinking since ASU isn't in session and everyone was home it'd be quick?- nope! It's usually pretty quick here anyway, I come all the time on Sundays when it's super crazy, sometimes I can't even find a table to sit at. Today it wasn't that busy at all but yet I waited for my food for an hour and a half!!!!!! When i noticed a few people who had ordered after me got their food already I went up and asked them to check on my order and explained how long we had been waiting and how people who ordered after us had their food they said \"sorry 20 more minutes\". 2 girls sitting next to us that had ordered before us didn't have their food either! Clearly someone messed up our orders. I decided to just get a refund and leave. So did the girls next to us! and of course that took like 15 minutes. 2 hours later I'm starving. I'm usually never a person who does something like this but that was horrible."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went this morning and everything was perfect!I like the Concept it's simple you order your food first and then you sit down and they will bring your food when it's ready! i gave a 5 star review because they deserve it!  the food is delicious and you can taste the freshness of their ingredients.the kitchen is Wide open so its easy to see how they operate and you can truly see that they use fresh ingredients.its was tasty and will definitely go back plus a lot of healthy choices!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. I came in for a place that sold turkey sausage. I have to say this was the most discussing turkey sausage. I'm wondering if it was actually park now. They said it was turkey. This jam doe the today is GREAT though. I asked for more. It must be apple and honey. Anyway it's great."}
{"text":"Loved it! The Greek omelet was great! I also had a bite of their French toast and I was very pleased. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant experience. I had the special. It was a sandwich on 12 grain bread...uh yeah, its good...with turkey and chilies and strawberry cream cheese, lets see there were field greens and melted jack on there too. Nothing but a slice of heaven! 
I asked for a recommend between the special and some other good sounding salad and the staff was friendly and smart about his tip. He said he tried the special, it was really good and not a lot of folks had ordered it. He recommended I get that since I could have the salad next time. Lucky thing it was great and yes, there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Line to order has five people, and two cashiers. Very tight space, and confusing to find end of line, and which way to queue.  Noise is deafening. I make eye contact with one cashier and she doesn't motion me over. I assume she is in training with the other cashier, and keep waiting.   Eventually I walk up and she asks how she can help me!  I said there's a whole line of folks who would love to be helped.  She says, \"Well, I said I could help who's next!\" as she inserts an eye roll and huffy sigh.  I explained it is loud, so we can't hear you speak, and placed my order.  

Fortunately my experience improved from there. Soft drink selection was good, although self-service area is very tight.  Took my number to the patio and my pear and bacon omelet appeared shortly.   It was lovely, and although the sliced almonds added a strange texture, the flavors blended well.  The fruit was ripe and sweet.  Server brought silverware and a tiny napkin in a logo paper bag, cute!  He was very efficient and brought hot sauce and cleared tables quickly. 

It began to rain so I moved inside and took a table.  I could then observe clearly how the line worked when there were 15 people in  it.  Much clearer.  Glad I missed the rush!"}
{"text":"Used to come here quite a bit then it went drastically downhill. College kids that don't care about their work behind the counter, cold food, and mediocre coffee. Those three things define this place for me."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. The chilaquiles were sweet, and not traditional at all, but had a good texture despite the weird taste. The market benedict was also okay: ingredients were good and fresh, the hollandaise was unremarkable, and it came out lukewarm. At least the coffee was tasty, and the service was very good."}
{"text":"NCounter is one of those places that I'm very surprised it's not a yelp 5 star. 

I bring my girlfriend here, my boss, my parents, my friends, clients, etc. Every single time (30+) everything has been fantastic. 

Great environment, great food and nice people."}
{"text":"Chopped salad is amazing but bananas foster French toast is excessively drenched in syrup and butter, and served with syrup and butter on the side!! Environment is great."}
{"text":"Nice vibe here. Cool setting, however, the portions are a bit small. I have had 4 different things and each time I come away slightly hungry and have to fill up with water. 

I would suggest to management that the menu on the wall be changed where people can read it from a distance and two, make it legible. 

Outside of those small things, this is a very good place to try different ways to make breakfast and other items."}
{"text":"The newest installment of Ncounter opened in North Scottsdale. We ordered the red velvet waffles, croque monsieur, huevos n' chorizo, and P&B smoothie. Everything tasted delicious! The red velvet waffles were fluffy and with a white glazed, dipped in syrup they tasted heavenly. The Croque Monsieur dripped with gruyere cheese and the yolk burst into a yellow goodness that topped the humongous sandwich. The salsa in the huevos n' chorizo made the dish, and the P&B smoothie tasted just as it should, like P&B!"}
{"text":"Sweet heavens there's a good breakfast place on Mill now!

NCounter is fast, fun, and tasty. Great portions, good variety, well-executed meals. I've been three times this week, and I've noticed a few minor missteps, but it's their first week and they're off and running.

Loved the bananas foster french toast (though the bananas were a little cool, as was the bacon that came with), not sure if they use real maple syrup, since it was coated in awesome... wouldn't mind clarification on that.

A bit annoyed that they only have Minute Maid lemonade, and a few other things seem to be more quick-and-dirty versions than home-grown versions (the potatoes for instance, which are tasty, but don't strike me as homemade like Liberty Market's or Matt's Big Breakfast.)

Fantastic toast and jam, and good eggs. I tried their chicken sandwich on Foccacia today and it was delightful. Good portion, delicious, and perfectly cooked.

The atmosphere is fun, the cupcakes are dangerously dense and delicious, the seating is flexible, and the service was incredibly friendly and darn fast. 

I wish a few things were a bit higher quality, but that's because I've been spoiled to death by Matt's & Liberty's take-no-prisoners approach. NCounter is a great fit, they've done great things with the space, and seriously: three times this week, the office has trekked on down there."}
{"text":"What a great location and some good food. professional, clean and friendly service/company!"}
{"text":"Delicious place to grab salads or sandwiches on mill ave! The kale salad and chopped salad are amazing. Service is quick and place is clean. Highly recommend you go if you want a lighter and healthier option than most of the mill ave restaurant choices."}
{"text":"This place has made me a certified breakfast believer. SO and I were looking for some breakfast after a long morning of Pokehunting and stumbled upon this gem. The outside is underwhelming but once you go in, you're transported into this chic and very tastefully decorated breakfast bar with a great selection. I felt like I just left soul cycle in New York and came here for some coffee with my rich friends lol anyways, the selection was great and the simple breakfast (I think that's what it was called) really hit the spot. A new favorite!"}
{"text":"So happy this finally opened downtown! Best lunch place. The chopped salad is the best!"}
{"text":"Just got the Waldorf salad as takeout from here. OMG it was SO good. Frankly, I wasn't expecting it to be that great because this place gets an automatic crowd being on the Main Street.  The ingredients were top quality. The chicken was DELICIOUS. That's not a given. I live nearby and never choose this place because I am always looking for \"off the beaten path,\" but now I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend around ~10 or 11 am on a Saturday, and the place was packed. The line was nearly out the door. You order at the counter, get a number, and then find a table at which a waiter will come find you with your meal. 

I ordered the Original Chop Salad [$10] because the pictures that I had seen of it online were gorgeous. My friend had the Classic Eggs Benedict [$9].

The chop salad is as beautiful as it looks in pictures. It's delicious too. The salad dressing is a light pesto sauce that coats your salad just enough. I hate when the dressing is so overpowering or when the salad is drenched in sauce. 

There were some spots on the street available (you have to pay by the hour), so it wasn't too much of an issue."}
{"text":"The moment you walk in you will feel this good vibe and energy of people. Alexandra takes my order with great smile and friendliness. I had a loaded with a side of spring mix, it was a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Since the place is crowded, it takes a long time to get your order. I came here with my coworkers for lunch and we had to wait 30 minutes for food. 

It is also hard to find any empty table to sit; so one of us had to wait for the table while the rest of us ordered our food. This is not a place where you sit down and the waiter takes your order. 

Food was okay overall; it was not the best meal I ever had and it wasn't the worst either. 
I would probably go back when it is less busy. If we didn't have to wait, I would have given a rating of 3 or 4."}
{"text":"Nice out on the patio for brunch. Dog friendly as well.  Super cuteee!!! Great atmosphere, great staff 


The peanut butter cookie was phenomenal! 
I loved my portobello sammich with the salad on the side. I should have asked for the dressing on the side. They put so much dressing on it that I couldn't taste the salad.   great presentation by the way,  of course I took a picture of it. Haha :)

I am so coming back!!! Weeeee"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch spot. You would want to go here for dinner, too, but it closes at 3:05 p.m. I've wondered why it's 3:05, but I decided that maybe it's to give you 5 minutes to get in at the last minute. If not, oh well that's just my speculation. I have found it difficult to order because everything on the menu sounds good. I have eaten and loved the Banana's Foster French Toast, the Loaded Omelette and the Turkey Pesto on Focaccia. Yum Yum Yum. Oh I almost forgot I had the Blueberry Blast Smoothie and it was delicious- pretty much everything is good! They are also right next to the light rail. I like that A LOT! But beware, it's always busy, so it might not be a good place if you literally only have minutes. Another plus, is the patio is dog friendly. The patio is my favorite place to sit because of the great people watching opportunities on Mill Ave, but I wish it was a little bigger."}
{"text":"We decided to ride the light rail from end to end for something to do. We were going to get off at Mill and grab a bite at Whichwich but they were closed. Their loss. Ended up going here and it was great.  It was busy and filled with ASU students and hikers of A mountain. I got the original chopped salad. See pic. It was outstanding. If you've read any of my reviews you know it takes a lot to impress me and they did. My husband had the loaded omelette and also enjoyed that. See pic. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The line is long on the weekend, but it moves fast. They Will also take your order at the bar.  I had the pancakes and they were pretty good. It's too big for me to eat so I ended up taking some home. I also in the past tried the salad I believe it was had kale and chicken and it was very good. 

It's a good place to stop if you're on Mill Avenue. It is quite loud though during its busy times."}
{"text":"The Sunday morning hangover brunch crowd Nside Ncounter was almost exclusively sorostitutes and their frat bros wearing outfits that made me increasingly nauseated. ...We were off to a good start.

I ordered the carbs bonanza, aka the granola pancakes, aka two very large, plain pancakes with granola sitting on top of them, served with fake maple syrup. I was hoping they meant the granola was Nside the pancake, but sometimes my menu Nferences stem from too high of expectations. It was not impressive, if you hadn't deduced that from my tone, but it was made of enough wheat to soak up Nything you may or may not have consumed the night before.

Would I recommend Ncounter? Not N particular. But if you're N the area? It does the trick."}
{"text":"This place gets super busy!! But, I can see why... it was good food in a great Mill Ave location. Everything on the menu sounded good and everything I saw on other tables looked great.  If you go, just be prepared to wait in a line and scope out a table!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere! If there is something on the menu you're in the mood for, you won't be disappointed. If you pick at random, you probably won't be disappointed. When you see what others are eating at thier table, you'll wish you ordered what they have. .  . until you get yours."}
{"text":"So good! Came here for brunch/lunch with a large group. Patio seating was nice! Split the kale salad which was really good (chicken, cranberries, edamame, tomatoes and sliced almonds with a light lemon dressing) and the pecos sandwich (chicken cheese and peppers) both were so good! Good for groups and some people ordered breakfast and really liked it. Would definitely
Go back here and next time get a mimosa!"}
{"text":"Ncounter was an amazing breakfast spot! My friend and I went there during a weekday that we both had off and even though it was a little busy, the food came out at a somewhat quick speed, but good food does take time, so once we tasted our food, it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation for a fresh breakfast. I ordered the chipotle breakfast burrito and a flourless peanut butter muffin. Really good burrito! The chipotle sauce was really good and they were generous with the avocado. I often opt for egg whites which sometimes makes my food soggy, this didn't happen here. I'll definitely be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Ncounter! This is the perfect place for a quick breakfast or lunch. I've enjoyed the Chipotle Egg Burrito and the Red Velvet Waffles-TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend Ncounter!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the location. Their food is amazing. My favorite is the pesto turkey and their vanilla lattes. I usually call in for takeout because it's always packed. I love bringing lunch home from Ncounter and enjoying it on my patio. I crave it! It is slightly over priced but it's honestly worth it in comparison to other cafes and sandwich places. I personally feel like you get what you pay for. The only things I don't particularly care for is the location. I don't like searching for parking on Mill Ave just to walk into a massively crowded place where you have to shove yourself through the lines just to pay for your to go order. They really need to open another location to accommodate the number of people this place attracts. Preferably another location with a dedicated parking lot."}
{"text":"I LOVE NCounter!  They do breakfast well and have great dishes that are imaginative without going off the deep end.  If you like a Benedict and you are wild about cream cheese get the NCounter Omelets!  Seriously it is my go to item and it's like crack.  I also love that they have a protein smoothie on their menu so I enjoy my brunch with my man friend instead of getting stuck at some health food place.

With all this good food the place can get busy and slow which is the only negative thing I can say about it but I guess that is what happens when people find out that your food is freaking amazing.

I also love that I can order online for my to-go order.  Makes my life a lot easier with a few clicks of a button!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast this morning.  It was awesome!  Great Service, good prices, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Never as good as I want it to be. A façade of a boutique local goodness. Eating here is like watching reality television, in that it's very bad and we should all stop doing it

Consistently average food in a cool location with OK service. The only redeeming things about Ncounter (Jesus I hate the name even more now that I type it) are that I can crawl there from my condo and the coffee is self-serve.

The food I regrettably find myself coming back here for is the killer, a breakfast sandwich on ciabatta which is about 60% gorgonzola cheese and the rest dark personal shame and bacon.

In short, if you are trying to wake up tomorrow and do a little bit better than you did today, please skip Ncounter. This review was mostly to talk myself out of ever coming back here. Thank you for reading, God bless"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and was not impressed at all. We are local adults and have been wanting to try it but rarely have lunch time free. Everyone was served except us and we had 1 sandwich and a cup of soup and half sand. The soup was okay but the sandwich was so dry I almost choked and had to ask for some type of sauce. The pesto mayo had no flavor at all.  We weren't sure why it took 20 mins when everyone in the place had been served that came in after and when we asked if was like why we bothered. Just not happy and won't be back. Unfriendly cashier as well. I can't stand when I pay someone's check and they don't even say hello!"}
{"text":"Great eats and coffee with option for outdoor seating. Best of all....it's a dog friendly patio!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It is a winner. Price is good and the food is excellent! Their coffee is decent, but not amazing. I am a huge fan of their lunch and morning cocktails. It really adds to the appeal of the place! Parking is the biggest bummer, the best idea is to park in the A Mountain lot across the street... But you have to pay :("}
{"text":"Great! My boyfriend and I walked in and it seemed crowded. That wasn't the case once we ordered and found a seat. The menu was a bit overwhelming for the first time being there. I decided on the farmers market bene and I don't regret that decision. Coffee was excellent and was self serve. The only thing I found to be weird was that there were no napkins/silverware on the counters. When the servers bring the food is when they napkins and silverware are given out. Besides that, everything went swimmingly."}
{"text":"I went in with high hopes. I've heard so many good things. I was kinda disappointed.  I was expecting a restaurant but there was no greeter, no real service. You place your order and scurry off to find a seat. We went at about 8:30 so were lucky there. 

The food was mediocre at best. I got an eggwhite omelette that was quite bland. The coffee was like kerosene and they even messed up the bacon! Not crunchy, just kind of dry and lifeless. For the price I expected better, a lot better. 

The potatoes and the toast were the best part of my meal. As far as the experience goes, good location in Tempe. Easy to find parking.  Not bad, but certainly nothing spectacular to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Good place to eat and relax 
Clean place 
Great food 
Very helpful staff 
I am visiting Phoenix and asked the staff what to see and do while in town they were helpful on advice and polite I would certainly go back there again"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my love & my Oreo aka my puppy. It was a Sunday so it was a bit packed. 

I ordered the N counter omelette. This has all of my favorites in it. chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, cream cheese and hollandaise sauce. Everything was amazing, however I wish it came with more of the Hollandaise sauce. I also ordered the Melon Patch cocktail. This wasn't anything amazing to it. 

I really like this place a lot. The food is good and I like their outdoor patio and the fact that it's dog friendly so I can take my puppy. They'll even bring out a bowl of water for her. The only negative is I wish it was more restaurant style instead of waiting in line to order at the counter. Great place for breakfast/brunch though."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious and fresh. Modern atmosphere and delicious breakfast. I love the iced mocha and the tasty eggs with avocados,  english muffins, and spinach. They provide siracha sauce too! Mmmm

The only problem I had was that ordering area was two crowded and disorganized. It was hard to squeeze past people after I ordered."}
{"text":"When the food comes out right it's great... but it rarely does. I order extra crispy potatoes and bacon every time, every time my potatoes are cold or very under cooked. I'ts like they go out of their way to do the opposite of what I request. One time I bit into my pancake and the mix was running out, they didn't even cook it through. so I would say it's worth a shot because when its good its great, but don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in the Phoenix area! I used to live right by Tempe Town lake, and one of my favorite things to do on the weekends was to hike up A mountain and then grab brunch at Ncounter.  I always ordered either an omelet or the chopped salad. Delicious! And you can sit outside on the patio with your dog!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. So far I've had their blueberry muffin, coffee, french toast and chipotle breakfast burrito. They all did not disappoint. The breakfast burrito is very large, good enough to share with someone. I don't want to rehash what everyone else says. Come for the food and coffee - its worth it."}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and staying near the Phoenix airport. Decided to take the  light rail and was pleasantly surprised to find this place right in front of me when exiting the train. 

I ordered the eggs Benedict. Came with diced potatoes. I also ordered a coffee. Everything was good but nothing spectacular to rave about. I liked that the food wasn't greasy but the meal was slightly over priced in my opinion.

The guy at the register wasn't sure whether to address me as \"sir\" or \"man\" so he used both which was a bit weird. Haha overall good experience and a good place to come back to for breakfast. Again nothing to rave about but if you want breakfast and don't care to only try places worth traveling for, then you're good coming here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots on Mill Ave in Tempe (good for lunch too).  The food is perfect (eggs etc, sandwiches, salads) and quick (order at the counter and they deliver to your table). The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  Everything on the menu is delicious...I've tried it all.

It's right across from the light rail stop at 3rd & Mill.  There's also convenient parking half a block west in the garage.

So here are a few problems to keep in mind before you go (you should go, but beware):

1). The drip coffee sucks. If you want a good coffee drink ask for it at the coffee counter....or walk a block south to Starbucks.  

2). There is only one electrical outlet for public use in the whole place. So charge your devices before you go. No, I won't tell you where it is but if you see me there I might share it with you.

3). During the ASU school year it is usually busy. But don't let the lines keep you away. They move surprisingly fast and you will be eating sooner than if you were to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had the eggs benedict and they were average.  The place was hopping though so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"This is a Palo Alto wannabe!  It is clean, and the food is consistent for breakfast, but very uninspired.  I would say it is probably the best full service diner, I had been to in Tempe, AZ during my Sandy extended layover.  When I do return to the Tempe, AZ area it is probably one place that I may return to."}
{"text":"Love the environment of this place and there are many options to chose from. I went with the morning glory omelette and a side of fruit. The tomatoes were marinated to perfection and the omelette was super delicious. Only complaint is the weak coffee!"}
{"text":"While not the most spectacular breakfast I've ever had, there were a lot of good options from healthy to calorie-packed. Good for large parties because you pay at the counter and they bring you the food (no awkward splitting of checks). Glad to see some new places on Mill, hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch for my whole family. Really enjoyed the granola/fruit and waffles. My boys loved the bacon and french toast. Would definitely go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This place is a great pick me up and just what the body needs after the night before.  They have a good vibe and pride themselves on the atmosphere they offer.  The food is good basic breakfast food.

The day that I was there, it was dirty.  Yes it was fairly busy but they really needed more attention to the tables.  

The food was fresh and the orange juice was delightful."}
{"text":"Have never been there for lunch, but the breakfast menu is very good!  My husband loves the red velvet waffles, and I usually order the huevos and chorizo saute ... YUM!!"}
{"text":"A decent breakfast place in downtown Tempe. Not my absolute favorite, but pretty tasty and a good spot on Mill."}
{"text":"This place is packed during lunchtime. It was difficult to find a seat, but the wait was worth it. I ordered the Portobellini sandwich with a salad. I was so amazing. The ciabatta bread was warmed to perfection and the veggies were so tasty. The balsamic mayo is what really made the difference. It brought all the flavors together and tasted like heaven. I will have to come back to try their breakfast, of course. We had to sit outside and it was a bit warm, but their patio is great and will be perfect when the weather is cooler. The staff was friendly and fast, which counts for a lot when you have to order at a counter and the place is packed. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Usually when I find something I like at a restaurant, it's the only thing I'll ever order. At NCounter I have to try something different every time, and have yet to be disappointed. My only complaints are that they are on the slow side, yet they always seem to have a ton of asu students working. Would be 5 stars if the wait was less than 15 minutes for a to go sandwich!"}
{"text":"Good Brunch spot on Mill Ave! Fairly quick service. The setup is easy, an Order Here and sit anywhere flow. I have only been a couple of times, but the bellinis and mimosas are delicious. As well as the breakfast eggs, toast and grilled potatoes combo.  Parking is metered with a parking lot located directly across the street. Extremely close access to the light rail."}
{"text":"Cute little place with good food.  The breakfast every time we've eaten here is amazing."}
{"text":"I really like that Mill has another option for the working crowd nearby. With our office down the street, I was growing pretty tired of the uber college pub-deli-pizza routine, in fact I drive away from this areas most days. But NCounter is a nice addition: cool space and a much needed revival on this corner. The remodel was done beautifully and the place gets so much more traffic now than it ever did with a crepe and coffee shop. Kudos to opening something comfortable enough to sit down in but quick enough for take out.

The food has been decent in my experience. Having ordered several meatless entrees from both the breakfast and lunch menus, my consensus is that the quality and creativity is pretty much what I'd expect from any Mill Ave establishment. Not knock-your-socks-off, but much better than drive thru. The presence of some healthy options is appealing. The egg white omelette was ok, but relatively flavorless even with tomato, peppers (still raw), avocado and cilantro. I usually get the Portobello sandwhich veganized with no cheese or mayo, but they've messed up my order a few times for take out, meaning I don't realize the cheese is on there until I've walked back to the office. I do wish the counter staff would pay a little more attention when customers order, but they aren't rude.

Can't say I'm a regular, but it's good to have a decent nearby option that's not burgers and fries. I do love scheduling \"meetings\" here just to get out of the office."}
{"text":"I've been here once before, this time I was disappointed.

Cooks in the back are eating, eating, not tasting, (mind you I know the difference) in the back while they cook, stuffing bread into their mouths. I didn't see him wash his hands...
Now I can overlook that but then I ordered the Crack O' Dawn saute and it said GRILLED potatoes. Mine were definitely fried. 
But they did change them for me so I will give them one extra star for that. 

Overall, the result was a greasy plate with mediocre food. But the service was decent and the place looked relatively clean."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast or lunch.  Their food is VERY good.  When crowded, the food will arrive slowly and for one person at a time....... The staff is very friendly and the prices are not bad.  You can do some people watching while here as it is on Mill Avenue and it seems to be a college kid hang out (don't let that scare you as the crowd is very diverse)."}
{"text":"I went to n counter for lunch yesterday. It was fantastic. Definitely a place to go when in Arizona"}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast. Staff where friendly and engaging, the crowd is good looking and the coffee is self serve so you can choose all your flavourings and extras. Nice to sit at the bar and people watch! Also they offer a healthy options menu! DELISH!"}
{"text":"Great spot on Mill for breakfast or lunch. Clean & modern inside, great food, and quick service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place and as much as I also WANT to love it, there are some nagging negatives about NCounter that need to be resolved before I can.

Please note- if you request cheese to be added to your eggs, be prepared to be presented with an enormous GLOP of cheap, greasy cheese smothering the entire plate of eggs. I thought this was a fluke the first time I went, but on each subsequent visit the same thing has occurred. Last time I asked for *light* cheese and again I was presented with a massive dump of cheese on my eggs. And the quality of the cheese is not good unfortunately. It's greasier than a lot of what I \"NCounter\" elsewhere.

See what I did there? ;-)

The second time we visited, I ordered the red velvet waffles and the batter was way undercooked. I loathe sending dishes back but felt forced to because I didn't want to get sick!

On the third visit I decided to be \"safe\" and get toast. Well, hilariously the damn toast was burnt AF.  Can't cook waffles all the way through, but burn the toast.

Boyfriend's toast was also burnt. Maybe (hopefully) that will make him like this place less so we don't have to keep coming back!

I can't win at NCounter and thus, can't recommend it."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I always come here to grab a  quick smoothie from their bar. All their employees are super nice and friendly! My favorite smoothie off their menu is the PB&J smoothie. I haven't been able to try their breakfast or lunch yet but I will soon."}
{"text":"Really delicious breakfast with good coffee and a lot of choice. Much better than eating in the soulless hotel restaurant. Both high quality 'standard' breakfast items as well as more creative ones. For example, I had 'the pear', an omelette with pear, havarti, toasted almonds and bacon. Really yummy."}
{"text":"This is a great place on Mill for brunch.  I popped in in the middle of the week around 1130-12.  Surprisingly it wasn't too crowded with a busy lunch crowd. You walk in and order, they give you a number and bring your food to you.  

I had a cup of coffee and a loaded omelet with fruit as the side.  The omelet was deliciously huge and jam packed with ingredients.  The coffee was just average, I mean..it was in one of those metal towers I'm sure it was just old considering it was lunch time.  The place was very open and bright which is always nice for lunch.  

I'm looking forward to going back and trying their salad because they all looked great.  Service was fast and friendly, this is a great place to pop into for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"A really nice feel to the scenery. A very easy restaurant that was simple and cheap. Just walk up the counter, order, and wait. The only thing was how the food took a while to come out but that kind of thing happens in a busy restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious and a place I would go again."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a better addition to the downtown breakfast scene.  We went on a Monday morning and for a while were the only customers.  There were about 4 staff members, none of whom seemed at all friendly or interested in us.  We split a veggie omelette.  The omelette was above average but came with a side of obviously previously frozen potatoes.  Coffee was good.  I doubt we will be back however, since there are many other far superior places nearby for breakfast.  First Watch, Matt's Big Breakfast are two that come to mind."}
{"text":"I've found the perfect breakfast spot. Went on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was perfectly busy but we didn't have to wait for a table.  Had the Chipotle burrito and was pleasantly surprised how good this was. Probably the best I've had at a breakfast place. My BF had the loaded omelet.  He loved it (so did I). Food came out within 5 minutes.  The place has a great ambiance as well. I'm pretty picky about breakfast places but this place is great. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and this place is as cute and fresh as it can be. First visit I had the eggs benedict with potatoes. The eggs benny were delicious, the orange juice was fresh and cold, but the potatoes were average. Second visit I had the pear omelette and a little bran muffin. That may not sound good to some, but this was absolutely delicious. Great taste and presentation. The service is very friendly here and though it's crowded, it's super-clean. I wouldn't hesitate to visit again. Might skip the potatoes though."}
{"text":"I never enjoy writing poor reviews but I feel strongly about this one. This place has so much potential but fails to meet expectations... consistently.

My coworkers and I used to come to NCounter very often for lunch, it was always packed but quick and the food was always on point. Recently though, it's taken 15-20 minutes to get food (not that long in the scheme of things but pretty long for fast casual). Worse than the wait though, the food has gone downhill. We keep going though, hoping this time will be better than the next, but always leave feeling disappointed. 

My old go-to was the Foccaccia Roma-Chicken, which is still probably the best item I've had there, but lately has only had the tiniest piece of chicken. The Cobb sandwich and Pecos Grille seem like safe bets but are less than impressive.

And worst of all, I ordered the tuna melt today and it had almost 0 tuna - all mayo, lettuce, and avocado. I tasted tuna in maybe 2 bites of the whole sandwich. My coworker mentioned she had the same experience and doesn't order that sandwich anymore (in her words, \"Last time I had the tuna sandwich, I was so upset... like I'm almost called to let them know this is unacceptable\" lol... This would have been nice to know before I ordered, right?!)

Because I work in the area, I've only ever had lunch here. It's possible that weekend breakfasts are completely different. And the menu options are great - a lot to choose from and healthy options too. The atmosphere is also a plus - the patio is perfect for nice Tempe days. 

I just feel that overall, there are is little attention paid to detail. If some simple adjustments were made - both in the kitchen and with staff - it would make the WORLD of difference."}
{"text":"Superb breakfast... French toast is a must!  Awkard closing time, just make sure you make it in before then!"}
{"text":"Continue to come here for breakfast, been 8 or 9 times now and it still has yet to fail me. Today I had the santa fe sautee and it was delicioso!! There are so many options on the menu that it is hard to choose from, but I have definitely found 3 favorites on here. The turkey and avocado sandwich was not a fav.. but I'm not much of an avocado fan anyway. I definitely recommend this place to people looking for a good breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Loaded omelet (with nom nom potatoes) and strawberry banana smoothie - delicious.  

Order at the counter and then sit outside or inside.  Clean establishment."}
{"text":"For my first visit, this place was great! David and I stopped by here after a morning at the farmer's market downtown. The day was terrific for a bike ride and Ncounter was a nice spot to sit outside and refuel. 

Bike parking is available in the parking structure towards the south wall. There is a curb to protect from crazy car drivers from crashing into them.

The food was very good. I ordered the farmers market benedict, David had the chipotle egg burrito, and we split an order of waffles. Everything hit the spot. But I would say the waffles were probably my favorite part, and what I would order immediately when returning here.

Apparently, they serve breakfast all day which is a fabulous idea as I could go for breakfast anytime during the day. Their location off the Row is superb. Now, to make an excuse to bike down here again this coming weekend..."}
{"text":"This place was good, I'd been meaning to go in my time attending ASU but never found the time. We took our friends here after a morning at Papago Park and were not disappointed. The service was adequate, but the food was top notch. My wife's burrito was a little too greasy she said, but I had a sandwich and it was great.

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience. The only reason I am giving it two stars is for two reasons. One is for the delightful folks we met at the restaurant in order to not get kicked off of our table for 6. ( Yes, kicked off a table- Sheesh!) They were awesome folks though. Two, the woman who took our order was very nice. 

The restaurant is built with no rhyme, reason or sense. If it was not crowded enough they crowded even more tables into an already cramped space. They put the coffee counter in the worse strategically placed area in the entire restaurant. I got knocked over twice when I tried to refill my coffee. The restaurant itself is cut throat to get a seat and packed with angry, rude customers and staff who ask you if you are done yet. (Really? When I go out I do not want people rushing me and making me rush off my table. How rude) When we finally got a table we literally got told me could not sit there and had to move because it was reserved for 6 or more people. WHAT??? I have never seen this in a restaurant before. The waitress kept telling us we had to move. Finally, I was so pissed after she told us to go outside in 120 degree heat we went and got people who were waiting and invited them to sit down with us. We made a party table. The waitress was not happy with us. Oh well, the feeling was mutual.
The staff find it impossible to work here. They can not deliver the food or service the self serve coffee counter due to space limitations and crowds of people waiting to fight it out for a table. I had the sad misfortune to time my empty coffee cup with the staff members attempt to deliver a new urn of coffee. With that and other customers visiting the counter for napkins and such, it makes it a literally impossible and maddening task. The waitress trying to replace the urn was very rude and snappy with me. She about ripped my head off. Sorry, I am in your way lady. I am a paying customer actually trying to get some of your coffee. They really need to change the entire layout of how they do things here. I can't believe no one has ever gotten hurt or burnt eating at Ncounter. To make matters worse there is a table like two inches away from the counter. God forbid one sits at that table. 

So, \"what about the food?\" Hmmmmmm, I found the food not good at all. The coffee was not exceptionally yummy and was way too hot. I got the Banana's Foster and it was Blahhhh. It tasted weird and made me feel sick afterwards. It had some weird sauce on top of it that did not taste right and was strange to the touch. Also, part of our order was not delivered and we had to drive back to get it. My meal was also not hot enough. 

On the fair side, my friend had the ham sandwich dish that has a french name to it. I tasted it and it was okay but not good enough for the price. The brownie cookie we had was good too. It wasn't the best I have ever had but good. Their other bakery items looked promising, except maybe the bagel, which looked gross. 

The entire experience was so aggravating I would not go back unless it was winter for patio seating, and or off hours, ( But what are their off hours here? This is the second time I have been here and it was too crowded to get service) It seems taking things Togo here might be the way to go. However, then they would need to change the name of the restaurant wouldn't they?"}
{"text":"Love that this place is open until 3pm. We're late risers and never seem to make it out of the house before noon! That being said, we were there today for breakfast and the food was very good. I had the farmer's market bene and it was really tasty, although just a little tiny bit less than hot. Still good and the potatoes are amazing. Hubby had the crack o' dawn sautee dish. He said it was really good and the jelly on the toast was super tasty. My biggest beef is with the bartender/barista who lost my order for a latte while chatting it up with some girls at the counter and we had to go ask for it and then it came after my food and was also less than hot. Otherwise, I'd totally go back again as the stuff other people were eating also looked really good, including the pancakes which I have to try next. I'm hoping the orders will be timed out a little better next time."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today while visiting Phoenix. We attempted to go somewhere down the street that had a crazy wait then I called this place and they said there wAs no wait for our party of six so we walked over here. The atmosphere seems really new and fresh and modern. Lots of tables in an open space. You order at the counter and take a number. 

The service seemed like they were new. It took our group probably 20 minutes just to order cause the girl seemed a little slow and confused on the register but she was friendly. Same for the girls that brought the food out, she seemed like she was asking us a lot of questions about what else we need with our orders and such and we were like don't you work here? They didn't bring enough silverware, or napkins or waters or anything, didn't ask us if we needed ketchup or anything else either. We found it at the drink station but with how slow they were it would've  been nice if they had done more so we could just eat and not have to keep getting up during our meal to get things. 

Food. The food was pretty good. 

Eggs Benedict- my mom and I and another friend all got this and we really liked it. Except the sauce was lacking that lemony taste we were used to. So the sauce could have been improved but it was still good. 

Belgium waffle- our friend loved this, said it was delicious. She got a side of bacon and said their bacon wasn't very good and somehow lacked flavor and was to chewy. I also tried the bacon and agree it was very chewy and only flavor it had was salty. 

Red velvet waffles- other friends shared this and they enjoyed it.  

Over all the food was great they just need to brush up on their service. It was a nice brunch and we were satisfied after the first place not working out."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I think they have been open about a year and one half & I have probably been there 40 or 50 times. I believe I have had everything on the menu & I have to say it is ALL superb! The place is up beat, great staff & super food! Between the breakfast & lunch menu, you could go there every day & never get tired of it. I was there today for lunch with a friend & we sat out on the patio - just delightful all the way around. If you haven't been there you are missing the boat!"}
{"text":"You order in at the back counter...It's called Ncounter so I guess that's only fitting. Choose your own seats. I ordered the Ncounter omelette- yum! Don't get the potatoes as a side though, they're kind of soggy and definitely not crispy enough for my liking. Mix the jasmine tea with some lemonade and sit outside- it's a perfect self-made arnold palmer of sorts! Patio is great for people watching!
Bussers/servers are generally really cute. Just don't say the first thing that comes out of your mouth when you Ncounter (HAHA SEE WHAT I DID THERE?) one though...Because if you're like me, it'll go like this:
\"I'm sorry I got sweaty and sweat all over this bench. Sorry. It's hot. Sorry. Bye.\"
The cute busser will laugh and say \"It's ok,\" and then talk to the other busser about how awkward you are (probably).
Then you'll walk away awkward and horrified and you'll never want to come back, but you definitely will because the food is good and the people there are attractive."}
{"text":"It was my first time walking in downtown Tempe and decided to go somewhere for a quick bite.  I loved how the name looked like a little scrabble piece and how the table \"numbers\" were letter themed.  I ordered a green juice called \"The Hulk\" and split a very yummy, warm blueberry muffin with my sister.  The juice was good, and some of the ingredients were spinach, banana and yogurt, I believe.  Only little funny incident was when we stood up to leave and I had a good 3 quarters of my juice left.  I looked away and looked back and my juice was missing!  Points for them, for being so quick to clean up and I was able to catch the server before he tossed my juice.  No harm, no foul."}
{"text":"Have you ever fallen asleep at a night club and woke up there the next morning? I haven't, but if I ever had, I would imagine it would be like waking up in this place. NCounter could be a \"Morning Club\" where you get coffee and orange juice, after your night of martini's and dancing at the night club.

There is definitely an energetic vibe here, (maybe not everyone likes that in the morning.....so, be forewarned) there is loud music, tons of people and good food. It's a walk up to the counter sort of place, you might want to stare at the menu overhead before getting in line and delaying everyone behind you as you try to make up your mind (sorry everyone! I'm one of those indecisive persons that annoy everyone.....) I ordered an omelette (finally) which was pretty good. I'm looking forward to trying more of their dishes (including some of their healthier options, like the egg-white omelette). 

Anyways, this really is a fun breakfast stop (especially if you don't feel like going to those truck-driver diner type places and are looking for something hip and fresh...[and eye-opening!])"}
{"text":"\"The Killer\" sandwich well crafted. The Thyme was a nice touch. 

Chipoltle egg burrito left much to be desired. 
The flavors, I assume would all mesh well, if they were all detectable, which they werent. Well concieved as an idea, poorly executed in the kitchen. 

The potatoes werent great either. Obviously re heated enough to sap the smaller pieces of all moisture leaving them hard. But I didnt have to salt them, which is unusually pleasant. 

The chocolate chip cookie brittle. 

The style of dining (counter service with expo and bused tables) left me focused on the food. I call this the reverse Dennys plan. Good food, meager service.  

In short, $30 bfast for 2 when the majority of the dishes are not well executed was dissapointing. We will try again, but not soon."}
{"text":"Came here after going to the gym. Really cute place great clean food Maranda was super nice showing us all be full menu items. Fun afternoon."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place out, but the place in general was mediocre and overpriced. The girl behind the counter was pretty impatient and rude even though we weren't particularly slow and it wasn't even busy.

I ended up getting 2 pieces of pretty average french toast with strawberries that looked and tasted like they came from a can or a jar (blech), and two tiny sausages for over $10. Nothing special, and the lack of fresh fruit really just ruined it. My roommate had an omelette and while our food wasn't bad and the atmosphere was nice, it just wasn't quite worth it."}
