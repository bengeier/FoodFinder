{"text":"This place has an interesting mixture of decoratives inside, that range from a wildflowers poster to a giant egyptian fresco.  This may be awkward, but it matches their billboard outside which advertise anything from pakistani food to pizza and fried chicken.  The menu is delightful to look at, and they have made a respectable attempt at explaining the assortment of exotic dishes.    We ended up ordering (in proper rank): - Shrimp tikka masala: delicious spicy shrimp mixture with onions and vegetables, very different than your usual indian chicken tikka masala. - Lamb Biharee: a kebab made of lamb slices rolled up with an assortment of spices. The spices tasted great, but the meat was somewhat soft and somewhat chewy, and not very tender. - Beef Chapple/Chapli/Chapel: a north pakistani specialty, which is some kind of minced beef mixture. This dish was quite tough and spicy, which ended up being the least favorite of the table.  Though the only standout dish was the shrimp tikka masala, the restaurant really redeemed itself with the two breads we ordered:  - Potato (spicy) stuffed paratha, deliciously crisp on the outside and soft with the potato inside - Zaatar/Zaetar bread: a kind of flatbread brushed with oil and savory spices, another very good pick.  With all the spices in the food, the customary mango lassis had to be re-ordered... :)"}
{"text":"What happened to the owners of Bismillah? Why did they close? Did they re-open somewhere else? I loved this place!! Food was excellent and the owners were very nice and willing to go the extra mile to keep me happy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. Do not be put off by the location (on the side of an old hotel) or the, let's say eccentric, decor because the food is well worth it in my opinion. We ordered the chicken boti and the goat qorma with naan. I should note we also asked for a vegetable samosa but the server either forgot or didn't hear us, but obviously didn't charge us. However, that didn't ruin our experience at all and it was actualy lucky since we were full with the other orders.  First thing I'll mention is the naan was the best I have ever had. I can't be sure if it was homemade but it sure tasted like it and I could have made that my meal and been happy.   The Qorma was delicious. The goat is served on the bone, I know not everyone likes to pick at bones  but I didn't mind, and is cooked in a delicious sauce that I couldn't stop scooping up with my naan. Also we were asked if we wanted spicy or mild, and I love spicy food but I'm happy I chose mild so be forewarned, it has a pleasant kick.  The Boti was just as good if not better. Tender pieces of chicken cooked in some type of spice rub and served with a yogurt/sourcream mint sauce. The cool sauce with the mild chicken was great and particularly tasty when wrapped up in a bit of naan.  Is this a high end 5 star restaurant where you should get dressed up, absolutely not. However I love hole in the wall treausres like this and if you like Indian, Pakistani, or Middle Eastern cuisine I highly recommend it. Good prices, most meals 8-10 dollars with some slightly more or less. I will definitely be back again."}
