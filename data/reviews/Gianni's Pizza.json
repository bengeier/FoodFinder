{"text":"This filthy place in McDonald PA is a joke just like the employees there! I've owed a business for 17 years and never once answered the phone they way they do,talked to customers the way they do,and make smart ass comments as you walk in the place or walk out of the place like they do! They will take your money AND tips but not any criticism when they deserve it FOR ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! It was close at one time and convenient for my family to order from here,but the food is a hit or miss,we have gotten more burnt horrible tasting food from here than good food,problem is,no amount of good food or convenience would make up for the ignorance of the staff and the filth! My only tip for this place is U SHOULD CLEAN UP YOUR ACT AND RUN A BETTER BUSINESS,GET RID OF YOUR RUDE STAFF \"MANAGEMENT\" THATS A JOKE,AND CLEAN YOUR PLACE UP! This place really needs to be looked into very closely !"}
{"text":"I order from Gianni's in Mcdonald frequently and they are always very fast and always have my order correct."}
{"text":"I'm done with Gianni's.  When we moved here 6 years ago we had good pizza from them.  Now it is a total waste of money.  My last order was a large square pizza with half of it pepperoni.  The delivery guy arrived with no receipt.  The pizza had all sloshed to one side of the box.  The pizza was still raw and doughy and to top it all off, there was only pepperoni on 3 of the 16 slices of pizza.  If you call to complain they are rude and hang up on you.  Terrible service.  Terrible food."}
{"text":"Every time we order from there something is wrong.... the bill is either wrong or the food is wrong. Ordered a calzone which was just all bread and pretty much no meat and a medium pizza... the bill was $31! The deliver person had to change the price for us because he even knew that it was way too much money for 2 items.  We have given them many chances but thats it for us.."}
{"text":"This place is okay for anytime you are craving pizza and there's no other place to go....but everyone looks underage and looks like they have bad hygiene, and the kitchen looks absolutely filthy. Not filthy from the day/night of working but filthy like they haven't thoroughly cleaned their kitchen in months. I'm surprised health inspectors haven't shut them down for good."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good.. Italian hoagie was pretty terrible unfortunately. I also never get a friendly voice when I call for delivery. Wish they'd be a little more enthusiastic about getting my business."}
{"text":"Pizza is greasy. Hoagies are mostly bread and somehow always burnt. Place is known for hiring preteen girls and selling weed, I'm surprised people actually eat there."}
