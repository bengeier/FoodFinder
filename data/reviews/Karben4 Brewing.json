{"text":"Three words:  Dreary.  Bleak.  Pretentious.  I really don't understand what the hype is about.  I felt like I was sitting inside a warehouse, the atmosphere is austere and unwelcoming...and it didn't help that the complimentary popcorn was burned. I couldn't get out of there fast enough."}
{"text":"Karben4 is a beer connoisseur's dream. I recommend their Fantasy Factory and Champaign Tortoise. Their whole list is great! The staff is excellent; ask for Rudy, who has a wealth of knowledge about beer. I also had the opportunity to meet Ryan (one of the owners), who is also very knowledgeable about beer. Please do yourself a favor and visit Karben4!   I forgot to post this a while back."}
{"text":"Solid selection of excellently Crafted beers.  My favs were the the red, coffee stout and RyePA.  Sausage tray, spinach salad and Port mushroom sandwich were very good."}
{"text":"The old Ale Asylum space is definitely being put to good use. With Underground Food Collective food and snacks, I have absolutely nothing to complain about.   Their beers are solid. Some are better than others. I really liked the SamuRyePA and the Silk Scorpion. The Nightrain smoked porter is popular, but not my thing. My husband got the red, which was not red at all.   We got pretzels and deviled eggs, which were delicious. My dining companions got the open-faced pulled pork sandwich, and wholeheartedly approved. I wanted to try the grilled cheese, which sounded amazing, but I wasn't hungry enough to justify it. Next time!  All in all, Karben4 is doing very well and I think has great potential. I would like to see more variety and more refined beers (I can haz DIPA plz?) but they are off to a great start!"}
{"text":"I really liked Karben4. It's like they did an evaluation of Simon's beer tastes and decided that it was time. A line of beers based on English malt? Don't mind if I do. We definitely left with a growler of the Undercover.  The space is pretty cool. We went on a Sunday and had brunch while watching the Packers on a couple of large televisions that still manage to fit into the space in a pretty natural way. It's definitely the kind of place that has those TVs so you can watch the Packers or Badgers play, but don't expect to see them on and running 24/7. This spot is about interacting with your fellow patrons and coming together over an excellent pint.  The brunch food was simple and good - nothing to wow you. But let's be honest, I didn't drive all the way over to Stoughton (sp?) Road for the breakfast sandwich. They have a small kitchen in a spot that is about the beer and from the two meals I saw I think they have done a nice job coming up with a menu that allows them to provide enjoyable food to go along with their enjoyable beer.  So last point - can you please transplant yourself downtown? Pretty please? I'll be back, I'd just be back more if you were within a few blocks of the Capitol!"}
{"text":"Karben4 is slowly becoming to me a 'go-to.' As I'm writing this I'm trying to decide if I mean that in terms of their location on the east side or if I mean their beer overall. I've hit up their location on two occasions and have been pleased both times.   The service is fine, no complaints, they were prompt and pleasant. I had their pretzel sticks in beer cheese sauce on both occasions as it was a great price on their Sunday brunch menu. Remember this, during their brunch time on Sunday (maybe...10am-4pm??- don't quote me on those times) you can ONLY order from the brunch menu. This did not deter me at all but just FYI.    The beer was the obvious champion here and the reason it can one day receive a 5-star review from me, especially as I begin to try more and more of their brews. My favorite is their Block Party Amber - to the point where I'm now slightly hopeful every time I see the Karben4 handle that it won't be the standard Fantasy Factory (also a fantastic brew, mind you) but might just be Block Party. Alas, it is not readily available everywhere so I take it when I can get it. It's what I want in an amber ale - clean, crisp, solid body and maltiness. I have also had and very much enjoyed the Tokyo Sauna (a not-too Aley, but brightly-flavored pale ale), Fantasy Factory (their flagship IPA) and just recently a Martian Sunrise IPA which I will highly recommend to get ASAP as I believe it is seasonal.   I very much enjoy the ... industrial artistic grunge... theme and vibe they have going on at the Karben4 location. Their bar area keeps the focus on the brewery area and equipment and enhances it with an industrial, factory-like atmosphere with some gnarly décor - paintings mostly, that give you a great feel of the weird they are trying to portray in both their beer and culture.   Kudos, Karben4 and please push out your Block Party Amber to as many places as possible!"}
{"text":"My beer drinking friends say the beer is great! I have come in 3 times for lunch and the food is the best. Thursday's special is goulash, yum it got me to share with Yelp. They have their own take on food and it is the right take. The goulash is make with local pork that is fed left over mash from the brewing process. Got to be happy pig and it makes tasty pork.  All 3 meals I have had are all five stars. Stop in for great local food and beer!"}
{"text":"Great brews and good food. We sampled 7 beers and all were delicious. Food hit the spot. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great beers (if you like hoppy brews) and food. I had the grilled cheese, which was yummy. The wait staff is exceptional. I had a sampler of beers, which included the seasonal brew."}
{"text":"I've never had an entire meal there but I have always been impressed by their level of service and more importantly their beer. I usually come in the evening and the tap room is generally busy. Even though the staff is busy, they do a great job getting to every patron and making sure their beer stays full."}
{"text":"The quality of the beer at Karben4 is obviously going to be subjective. We tried three different beers and liked two of them. They're all $5 a pint. The food, on the other hand, is by Underground Food Coop, and it's amazing. I've been mourning the loss of Underground Kitchen since the fire (Forequarter is good, but it's a different genre than Kitchen was), and the small menu at Karben4 is the closest I've seen to the \"late night\" snacking that existed at Kitchen.   The deviled eggs and summer sausage sandwich were both great, but the pulled pork sandwich was ridiculous. Comparable to famous BBQ places in the South, even. It's a solid 1/2 pound sandwich, so you'll probably need to pass out for a couple hours after eating one, but it's worth it. We'll be going back for sure even though it's out of the way from downtown."}
{"text":"This place is an Eastside gem. They have really expanded well with their beer selection. My favorite is the Tokoyo Sauna Pale Ale. The food is also delicious, with homemade bare fare like soft pretzels and local favorites like Stalzy's bread, Underground meats and Frabroni pizza. This space used to be where Ale Asylum was and it really has a cool ambiance. I like what they've done with the interior. I feel like this is one of the few places in town that has a truly unique space and great, honest food.   Best words to describe Karben 4 - Low Key and Delicious!"}
{"text":"Bad food but Good beer and good staff. While a couple items on the menu are palatable, the majority of it is unfortunately awful and disappointing. Again, the beer is great and I enjoy most of them, but don't go there hungry or you'll be disappointed. Fix the food and I'd give you a 4"}
{"text":"Just when you think there is no more room for yet another microbrewery in Madison, in steps Karben4. Solid beers with terrific, knowledgeable bartenders.  Just one more reason the Madison-area is a beer lovers Nirvana!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch here on the way to MKE and were so glad we did! Pretzel app and our sandwiches were exceptional-I especially liked all the fresh produce (I had the avocado BLT). The amber ale was delicious, but my partner wasn't so fond of the \"Oaktober\" beer. Ambience was attractive (I loved the artwork) but the vibe was not particularly warm, for a taproom-- but this seemed in keeping with the brand. I'd love to return and try the Fantasy Factory IPA! The quick access from I-94 was clutch, for a Madison stop."}
{"text":"Loved this brewery! Great food and beer :) happy I made the stop. I had the Caprese Sandwich and spinach salad with a beer flight. Lots of great flavor. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Arrived around 6 pm on a Friday and there was plenty of open tables.  We chose to sit outside since it was beautiful out, but be aware that you will have to smell other people's nasty cigarettes if you sit out there. Our server was great.  Very nice and attentive.  Guy with the brace on his wrist.   We got a flight of beer and tried every single beer they had which was, I think, 10 beers.  We loved the beer!  My husband and I both had our favorites, but all were quite tasty. There is a bunch of games you can play if you want.  We started with Password but the instructions were missing and we couldn't remember the rules, so we switched to Mad Gab.  Hilarious! Deducting one star for the food.  It was far from terrible, but nothing to get excited about.  Husband had a flat bread which he said was bland.  I got a half sandwich and salad.  It was OK.  Both of us thought the portions were a little TOO small.  Next time we will just try something else.  The picture of the deviled eggs looks amazing and this place is definetely worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I love this place.  the beer, the food, the atmosphere- they are the whole package.   For the foods I always recommend the boards - especially the artisan, next to a delicious Karben4 beer there is no better way to start.  The sandwiches are great, quality breads and delicious sides - I've ordered most of them at some point and haven't had one I didn't enjoy.  I will get the daily special sometimes, but usually like the sandwiches more.  Sunday brunch is awesome,  but I feel like the Bloody Marys used to be better, maybe they use a new recipe.    I've never had problems with the service here as other reviewers have.  I was actually pretty shocked to see so many complaints about it (especially that they get better service at Ale Asylum - it's always been very hit or miss on the servers there). Karben4 does have a small kitchen, and sometimes it can take a bit to get your order - but it's worth it.  With so many delicious brews that are rotated to the tap list, order up the session and enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"Great beer. The flavors are so smooth and complex. This micro brew does not look like much on the outside but the beer is outstanding.  The service was good and the ambiance is really nice. My fiancé and I had the goulash lunch special with garlic bread. It was better than your standard goulash. I am defiantly going back and trying some other menu options that caught my eye. Brought a growler of Luck Lady home."}
{"text":"Karben 4 is my favorite type of microbrew, but the service the \"bartenders\" give is terrible. They seem so confused at how to pour you a beer and how to serve you. I gave an extra star because I like their beer. The food tastes like they microwaved it, and it took more than an hour (on a non busy day) to bring the food to the bar."}
{"text":"Great food and even better beer. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable. I will be back!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place with really good beer. The only thing I disliked was the fact that I live in Illinois and that the facility is in Wisconsin. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great brew selection, great labeling and great food. Just before you walk in it looks like you are going to a rundown strip mall. When you get in the ceilings are high, the art is great, and there is  a real well thought out visual placement of the brewery  The service girls are professional, fun and know beer. Best spot in Madison."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch on Friday, August 4 as we were driving through town on our way to visit family. We've had Karben4's beer before and were excited to try their food. The menu sounds great, but the food was very disappointing.   As soon as we sat down our waitress told us that they were out of the Reuben Sandwich and a few of their beers. We really appreciated her being up front with us- it's disappointing when you find out a restaurant is out of something as you're placing your order.  We ordered the Creamy Peppadew Sandwich with the daily side which was a Vegan Mediterranean Pasta Salad and the Caprese Sandwich with the chips. It was only when our food was brought to us that we found out that they were also out of the bread that usually gets served with these sandwiches. There are five sandwiches on the menu and four of them are made with the Stalzy's wheat bread that they were out of. The fifth sandwich, that isn't made with the Stalzy's wheat bread, was the Reuben...which they were out of because they ran out of sauerkraut!!!! I think it's poor management for a restaurant to run out of a staple ingredient, such as bread, that is used for multiple items on their menu.   Now I will say this the home-made pretzel roll that they ended up serving our sandwiches on was very tasty, but it didn't pair at all with the sandwiches we ordered. There was too much bread and not enough sandwich fillings. The kitchen did a very poor job of trying to recreate their menu items with what little ingredients they did have in stock. The Caprese Sandwich only had a tiny sliver of mozzarella cheese on it. I had to take off the top of the pretzel roll to eat the sandwich open face, but even then I couldn't taste the mozzarella and there were only a few measly slices of tomatoes and pieces of baby spinach. They also forgot to put the basil aioli on the sandwich, which we had to ask for it on the side. We ended up spreading the aioli on the other slice of the pretzel roll, essentially eating a plain roll for lunch. The Peppadew Sandwich was a little more flavorful, but again it was all bread and only a couple slices of turkey. The amount of sandwich ingredients they put on our sandwiches may have been enough if they were using their regular bread, but if a restaurant runs out of ingredients and still tries to sell the menu item, then they should make up for it and serve a better sandwich with more fillings. The Mediterranean Pasta Salad was fine, it was somewhat bland.   I wish I would have taken pictures of the food. We probably should have returned both of our sandwiches and left, but we'd been out running errands and were very hungry. Besides, I'm not one to return food and I've never returned an entire meal before.  Our waitress never once asked, while we were eating, if everything was okay. She only asked if we needed anything else. Obviously, she could tell that we weren't happy, and maybe we should have said something earlier, but she didn't even apologize for the Caprese Sandwich not having the basil aioli on it.   It was only after we paid the bill that she finally asked if everything was okay, but by that time it was too late to improve our dining experience and she didn't make any offers to anyway. All she said was that the food is usually really good- if that's the case then how could she have looked at what came out of the kitchen and think that it was okay to serve us subpar food?   Maybe we came on an off day, but we travel through Madison quite frequently and will never stop to eat at Karben4 again."}
{"text":"Okay...before going here you need to know what you want before arriving.  I've been here many times since I work down the road and there's pluses/minuses on it all.  If you want a few good beers, then you can't go wrong.  They have a great selection of many microbrew beers and you can see the warehouse from the bar.  If you want food, then it's your choice.  Their food selection is like a large list of appetizers.  They try to look high end with drizzled dipping sauce on wooden planks and a baked pretzel, but the price for that pretzel is more than I'd pay for something I can get at the mall down the road.  The homemade smoked sausage is great but the smell & price (I'll be honest here though...I love the smell) will turn some people off.  They have big screen TVs that play sports that are on sporadically and board games next to the window for anyone to play.  Sooo...it all basically depends on what you want.  Some expect beer and great food while watching the big game on TV, but your best bet is a great beer with overpriced apps while watching the game if they allow it to be played."}
{"text":"I agree with Steve L's review, the beer and food are fantastic. The service does not match your other operations.  We've had the house made pretzel, the sandwiches, and pretty much all of the beers on tap - all of which are delectable.   We have enjoyed your out door patio area.  Where it falls short is the service.   I appreciate that a brewery is open until Midnight from Thursdays to Saturdays. However, if you are going to try to get your foot in the door for your food/bar then I'd indicate that to the servers and operate as such.  We were recently there on a Saturday evening, arriving at 11:30 pm, we ordered an appetizer and two sandwiches, along with beer. Our server as great and  took our orders without giving any stink eye or rush. We sat in the patio area with four other tables taking in the cool night and enjoying their brew. As soon as our food arrived, we ate, mindful of the closing time. At 11:50 pm, another server (not ours), began to take last calls. We decided not to refill while other tables did. She came back out to the patio area again a few minutes past midnight and began to go around each table commenting, \"hey, just so you guys know, we close at midnight, right?\". That was such a turn off considering she just served these tables last calls and we still haven't received our check. Why not just cut people off if you're so intent on going home? If you want the revenue of a bar, then train your servers as such.  Next time, we'll go a few blocks down to Ale Asylum, they close at 2:30 am on Fridays and Saturdays, and we've never been harassed there."}
{"text":"I love it here. Everyone is super friendly. The muffuletta sandwich was delicious. The flatbread, pepperoni, was kinda lame & forgettable. Good music. Good vibes."}
{"text":"We went  to Karben4 over the weekend.  The female bartender was very attentive and easy to like.  The complimentary popcorn was good.  The beer was likable but not out of this world.  I will say, the food we ordered was the best part.  The portions were just right for being a brewery/bar and the sandwiches were extremely tasty.  The biggest down side is the decor, very cold and uninviting.  The walls give off a dark vibe but the lighting seems bright - sterile.  We won't be making this our \"go to\" bar but we'll probably go back for a sandwich and beer."}
{"text":"Let me preface: I am wading into the IPA pool very GENTLY...like tip toeing one step at a time. With this said, a friend recently raved about the fun time she and her hubby had here. I figured it was time to test it out... I mean we're not in Cali so it can't be too hoppy. We arrived on a Saturday evening. Parking lot in front so that beats anything downtown right away. Nice to see someone took over the old Ale Asylum building; gives me hope that Karben4 will jump up to larger scale production soon (more beer at the store!). A decent amount of people were already there, maybe neighbors but this is on an industrial commercial corner so not sure. I'd heard about the patio so we stream-lined it there. Still bright outside so no lights on, but nice either way. Service was a little \"relaxed\", but we kinda snuck in - we flagged them down. I knew right away what I wanted so without menus (already on the table), I ordered samplers and the pretzel. Little bit of a wait (5-10 min), but not bad considering I was starving.   Beer - amazing! The sampler was 6 normal beers + 2 seasonals. Each was $2. They had a nice medley: 3 IPAs, 2 amber style (both = favorites), 1 golden (kinda like a kolsch), 1 porter (light carmel stout flavor with light body), and 1 stout (heavy smoke, chocolate with medium body). The IPAs ranged in ABV and IBU (hop strength). While I can't truly give the flavor profiles yet (I'm still at \"soap\", \"floral\", and \"lemon\"), we both were able to rate and drink them (way better than a few months ago).   Pretzel - needs it's own category! I don't know what to tell you here. It's a real pretzel, with a soft inside, nice coffee brown color outside, light salt, warm, oozing heat, swiped with butter, and a good amount of spicy brown mustard on the side. This is the best pretzel I've ever eaten. It does deserve a rave review. We got two. You can also order pretzel sticks (approx 6).   Meat board - anytime someone has Underground Meats, I order it. It was not their best options but it was still good. We got the smaller version ($9 vs $17). The onion jam on the platter was the worst part - not strong enough to compliment the meat; there are better onion and fruit jams out there. The \"crispy\" pita bread was too small, too bland, and too few (I need more than 5 for a spreadable cheese AND meat AND jam).   Overall, we brought a growler and loaded up! Champagne Tortoise you are yummy. This is a great beer option for Mad-town. Better non-IPA options than Ale Asylum, closer than New Glarus, better food than Capital, but more industrial than the Dane. As for tours, not sure. I wasn't there for that, but I saw someone else had on a wrist band. We will go back."}
{"text":"Block Party has been in my top 5 Wisconsin beers for awhile now, so it was good to check out the home turf. I like the trippy artwork and the board games available to play. The patio is the place to be when the weather's right.   What's cool is that they don't sell all of the beer available on tap at the brewery, so you're getting a unique experience. I tried Lady Luck, an imperial red, and wowza it was smooth. Dark as Guinness, with deep notes chocolate after taste. My only complaint were the pretzels. They came out incredibly burnt and inedible. They literally looked like burnt sausages. Unfortunately, when we got another batch (which was thankfully fast) they less resembled cured meat but the taste was nonetheless bland. Basically, come for the awesome brews."}
{"text":"Wow does this newish brewery have some major potential! I tried their oak-aged Oktoberfest, which is an oak lover's dream. I also had a few sips of their red ale on nitro and was blown away - sweet, malty, traditional Irish red goodness.  They also have great (though limited) food. The summer sausage reuben on pretzel bun was fantastic, especially with the kraut made with their red ale (and I don't even like kraut). Add friendly service and a chill atmosphere, and you have a winner. I can't wait to come back and explore their offerings further."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a lunch beer. I had the Undercover. It was a session ale in the usual sense, low alcohol and went down smooth. I could easily have had another, but I chose to follow it up with the Oaktober Ale. It had a nice darker color and nose notes reminded me of fall yard cleanup, getting the potted plants out of the pots and off to the yard waste recycle. The bartender asked what I thought of the Oaktober. I replied, \"It tastes like dirt, but in a good way.\" Karben4 has been making some really good beers lately and I like the variety, they don't seem to be stuck re-making IPA's.  -LanceJay"}
{"text":"Needed to get some lunch and exercise so hopped on a bike at the bridges golf course and pedaled on over to karben4. Seemed liked it was down hill both ways (must of Been the sprechers). We all had the summer sausage pretzel bun sandwiches and rootbeers. They were outstanding will be coming back for the devilled egg sampler!"}
{"text":"The former Ale Asylum space takes on an Industrial feel with the dark blue, grey & green walls of Karben4. Large paintings add a splash of color but besides that the decor is minimal. I can't tell if that's the look they're going for or if the decorating in this new spot isn't quite done yet.  I'll keep my fingers crossed they're simply not done, because I feel like it still needs a dash more character and a touch of warmth. We all know I'm a sucker for both.    The beer selection is diverse and delicious ($5-6/pint) and flights are available for those who are indecisive.  The food menu is limited (translation: not a place you should necessarily expect a giant dinner, but certainly offers good drink accompaniments); everything I've had has been good.  The just-baked pretzels ($4) were piping hot although the mustard dip was heavy on the horseradish -- some people loved it but it  was a bit too spiiiicy for me.  (Admittedly, I'm a wimp.)  The deviled eggs ($5) were a nice treat and went over well, eight halves offering four different fillings ranging from traditional to cowboy to pulled pork.  My favorite was the grilled cheese ($6) which was a smaller sandwich (don't expect a ginormous dinner) but just the size I needed and enjoyable with crispy bread, grilled onions and a sweet tomato spread.   The pool table is gone but board games are in.  The new layout offers more open space and multiple cut-outs to allow you to peek into the brewery zone in the back and check out the process.  There is a modest after-work crowd, but plenty of room to bring a large group with many high-top tables to mill around.   It appears there will be a patio area in the summer so that will certainly be nice.    BOTTOM LINE:  Beer is delish, food is a-ok in my book, service was juuuust fine, I'd simply like to see the industrial/minimalist decor get kicked up a notch with a bit more warmth and charm!"}
{"text":"Located in the former space of the original Ale Aslyum, Karben4 offers their brews, pub food and brunch. We decided to head over for brunch. I expected a wait since their brunch is pretty popular, but we got lucky and didn't have to wait (I think we must have gotten there after the brunch rush). I've been checking out the menu for awhile and knew I wanted to try the Tiny Tim. The Tiny Tim offers a chance to have a little of everything for brunch (French toast, spinach salad, smoked bacon, ham and toasted pretzel bun with crumbled sausage, root vegetable hash with fried eggs). The French toast was really dry, but the fruit compote (which was more like a jelly) was tasty and not too sweet. The crumbled sausage and hash were a bit under seasoned and was dry also. I think having the egg soft fried would have been better so the yolk could be broken and add some moisture to the dish. The chicken for the chilaquiles had a nice kick, but again would have been better with a soft yolk.  The sample of deviled eggs was the highlight of the meal. The one I was pleasantly surprised by was the sriracha peanut butter. Service was good."}
{"text":"Tried this brewery for the hell of it. The beer is ok. The decorum is weird because it looks like an art gallery. There is no style in this brewery and comes off as cold and just put together with no thought. The window into the brewery looks into a not so pretty place, I would cover that. The people were nice but it doesn't have a brewery feel in any way. It's the start of something that didn't go any where. It's not a bad place but it lacks brewery character when compared to what Maddison has. It has potential and where it goes I don't know. The area is so off the beaten path and if I was not specifically going there I wouldn't find it."}
{"text":"For the beer side of this review, I would give 5 stars. For the food, I would give 3.5 stars. Service? Maybe 3 stars - average but not exceptional. I dove head first into the seasonal Martian Sunrise for my beer choice; a red IPA. It was excellent; hoppy with good aroma and Carmel-y flavor. I enjoyed it so much I had two. My date had a porter and the Lady Luck Red Ale, both of which I sample tasted, both of which were smooth and from the nectar of the gods.  For dinner, I had the Sriracha pita with a side salad. The greens were fresh and delicious. The pita was also outstanding, with flavorful cheese, tomatoes, ham, greens, onions, and Sriracha. My date had the sliders, which looked good via description in the menu, but looked less appetizing when they came out...just ground up hamburger on little buns.  I would call the food menu somewhat limited, but very typical of a Madison-hipster locale. I would go back....but mostly for the beer."}
{"text":"Best brewery in Madison by a fair margin. Location in a industrial strip mall near the airport is a bit underwhelming, but they do the best they can with the space. Bottom line - great beer."}
{"text":"We've had the pleasure of being here a few times before their grand opening, and on their grand opening night.  The guys that work here are super cool, personable and extremely generous.  The beers are all good, and I feel like they aren't capable of making a bad beer.  The atmosphere is nice and you just feel welcome.  I'm not usually a porter fan but their Nightcall is my new favorite beer.  And growlers for $12, is perfection.  We love Karben4 and tell anyone and everyone about it.  Go, try all the beers, you won't regret it.  (If you have an empty growler at home, bring it.)"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped on a cross county road trip from San Francisco. The sandwiches were great. Beer holds up our California palates. Idiot Farm, Lady Luck, and Dragon Flute were all delicious!"}
{"text":"Best beer in town. The Fantasy Factory IPA and the Tokyo Sauna Pale Ale are both excellent.   The interior is, as others have mentioned, a bit cold and warehouse-y but I like the paintings on the wall. Haven't tried much of their food but we got a summer sausage & cheese board which was more food than we expected and was a good complement to the beers.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was super torn on the rating I should give this place. On one hand, the beer is amazing. I have yet to have one that I didn't like. On the other hand, the service is downright bad. So I settled on 2 stars because to me, the service was more lackluster than the beer was great.  My boyfriend and I came on a Friday night, and the place wasn't very busy at all. They seemed to have a good proportion of staff to customers so we had high hopes. However we sat at the bar for around 10 minutes before getting a menu from the bartender. I think she walked past us 5 times before realizing we were there. It then took another 10 or so minutes to just order beer. However once we did order, she at least brought the beer to us quickly.   We decided to try the housemade pretzel with cheddar horseradish dip. It was pretty good, the pretzel was a little greasy for my taste but the mustard and cheese spread were really great. I would order it again.  When it came time to get our check, it again took what seemed like an hour (probably more like 30 minutes) to get the bartenders attention. By that time there were employees sitting at the bar drinking and she was far too distracted talking to them. I like bars where the bartenders interact with the customers and that did not happen here. Not to mention she was eating popcorn with her bare hands and then serving beer to people. That's not too bad of a personal health code violation, but it was still gross.   Overall we were really disappointed with our experience here. We do love the beer, but I don't think we'll return for a while. From other reviews it seems like their service is going downhill overall so hopefully they can get their act together."}
{"text":"Love love Karben 4 brews! They are even better on tap than in bottles!! Only had the chips and Guac for food and it was not good. They were both a kind of green goo. Tasted good I guess, just not my style- I prefer fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Probably some of my favorite beers out of all the breweries I stopped in while visiting Madison for a long weekend.  The hoppy beers were resiny and had great hop flavor!  Everything we tried at this place was awesome!  I'll definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, great fun...what more could you want?  I'm a big fan of their fantasy factory, and I also love mimosas, which made me fall in love with their version of a mimosa. Get it on Sunday mornings.  I'm also a huge fan of their homemade pretzels - try them as sticks or just a single pretzel; either way, you should get the horseradish cheddar, it's delicious.  In terms of fun, they have plenty of games for you to play there, including darts. They also allow you to bring your own games."}
{"text":"I've been putting off this review for awhile now, partially because I'm lazy, partially because I'm also busy, but moooooostly because I don't have a lot to say...  Karben4 has pretty great beer.  I can't say there was much more at the brewery than you have already had either from the store or at a local restaurant though which was kind of a bummer.  I didn't try the food or use the servers (we got beers from the bar and found a seat) so I can't say anything to either back up or rebut peoples' complaints about those.    Really?  Karben4 is a cool place to hang out and have a beer (especially their IPAs!) in a warehousey but artistic environment...with oooooookay food and service from what it sounds like.  I don't know that I would trek all the way over here from Chicago if you haven't made the pilgrimage yet but if you are in Madison, it's worth a stop because beer really is always better from the source."}
{"text":"We love this place. IPA Fantasy Factory is great. Good menu -pretty solid food options and bartenders very responsive on the Saturday night we were in doing out tour de IPA in Madison. Housed in the old Ale Asylum facility, this is a nice stop while in Madison. Hubby is an IPA fanatic and this place is interesting enough that we keep making the drive from Chicago to pick up beer and have a snack. Homemade cookies are available, love it!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for early dinner on a summer Sunday evening. We sat out on the patio which was lovely until the last 10 minutes when a group of smokers came out. I had almost forgotten that smoking is still allowed in the outside portions of Wisconsin bars/restaurants. That is pretty much my only reason for the 4 star rating. I think it would be super easy for this place to just not allow smoking, even on the outside patio. Numerous states have done it, come on WI, catch up! Otherwise the service was good (better than what was stated in some of these reviews), the beer was great and the baby portabello sandwiches were super yummy. I loved that they have numerous games stored in the window sills for you to play. We took advantage of the Jenga blocks to distract/play with our toddler as we were waiting for our food."}
{"text":"A+ for service at Karben4.  It was a March madness Saturday, and this was our first stop on a short circuit of Madison breweries.  At about 11:15am, we were their first customers through the door.  The bartender was incredibly friendly and it made a big difference to make us feel welcome in a bar that was just opening for the day.  Even though the place was empty for the first 15 minutes or so that we were there, she was in a good mood and happy to give us some information about the operation without being overbearing.    Every type of beer they served was solid.  The Deep Winter Stout, Fantasy Factory IPA and Nightcall Porter were all standouts on the flight we ordered.  The feel of the bar area is minimalist, modern, unpretentious, spacious and could double as a Tom Selleck shrine.  We never got around to asking about the artwork.  We also didn't order any food, but I was impressed enough with the place to make it a meal destination the next time I'm in town.  If you're in Madison and you want to check out the local brewing scene, Karben4 should be near the top of your list."}
{"text":"Came in here on Sunday around 3 pm for their brunch which is served until 4pm. However, we were told they are not serving brunch. WOW, what a disappointment considering they are advertising it.. Oh well.. Ordered 2 flights-decent beers,  summer sausage sandwich and muffaletta sandwiches-nothing to write home about.. Overall it was just ok, nothing less nothing more.."}
{"text":"Great out of the way place. The food was inspired and not the traditional pub fare. We had a sope and the pepperdew, both were delicious as was the spinach salad. Most of the brews were great. I'm not a fan of hoppy beers, but they had a balanced group of beers, both hoppy and not hoppy and in-between. This place is going to continue to grow!!"}
{"text":"Since we've been here last they updated their brunch menu, and got rid of our favorite the Tiny Tim. I had the hash instead which was about 50/50 ground pork and vegetables. Really greasy. Not a big fan. It'll be awhile before we come back."}
{"text":"Arrived for beerunch on a Sunday afternoon.  It was not crowded which is exactly why I like to start my beer day early.  My party of 6 spent the whole day sitting at the bar.  We sampled all of the beers on tap (delicious) and several of the food items (yummy).  A game of Cards Against Humanity kept us busy and drinking for a good part of the day.  I liked this place so much that I bought the t-shirt.  I don't live in Madison, but I will definitely stop in the next time I am on beercation."}
{"text":"Great place, nice updates so it doesn't look like Ale Asylum redux. Good beer--loved the smoked porter. Bradley Cooper lookalike bartender who also paints. Nice addition to the Madison microbrew scene!"}
{"text":"Spent the start of our day at Karben4. Excellent. Besides the excellent beer, they have Sunday brunch and their own blend of Just Coffee : K4. Bottomless!   Everyone was super friendly. We even got tips on how to score tix for the Great Taste. We tried every beer, pretzels, the Tiny Tim and the coffee. Try the maple siracha syrup. It's amazing. Karben4 does an excellent job of incorporating their beer into their food. A must stop when u r in Madison."}
{"text":"Traveling through Madison.  This place is a great place for food and craft beer.  They have build your own flights.  Plus their flatbread pizza is very good  not greasy at all.  Very fresh.  Will go back when in area again.  Server was very good."}
{"text":"BLT was amazing. Their beer, which is only a few (6) taps, is all very high quality. The music was also great. They play a lot of indie rock, reminds me of Seattle. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Good food, Beer good. Service mediocrity, 5 of us sat at a table for 6 and were asked to move to accomodate a potential larger party of 6 down the road. That never came. We were moved to the back of the resturant."}
{"text":"Wow this place was AMAZING! I went for brunch and ordered the tiny tim...but it WAS NOT tiny at all! Opened face pulled pork sandwich, bacon, ham, spinach salad, 2 eggs, and french toast all for $10! What a deal! I also ordered the mimosa, which is made with their IPA beer, and man it was delicious! I would definitely come back!   Added bonus they play GREAT music there! They also have a small outdoors area, so once summer comes you can definitely find me there!"}
{"text":"By far and away Karben4 has my favorite beers and the staff is always great! I have been here a dozen times and have never had a bad experience. My only complaint is that they don't have a downtown bar or a bar that has all of their taps. If I lived on the East side of Madison I would stop in a few times a week."}
{"text":"Beer is amazing but the food is pretty awesome too. Their deviled egg sampler is a must. Their salad is fresh and their sandwiches are creative and tasty.  I'm a big fan and try to get here whenever I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Not sure how the food is, but the beer is not too bad! We sat out on the patio on a Sunday night... and were the only people out there.  The service was pretty good. The guy was talkative and helpful when we were deciding on which beers to try.  One of the biggest problems, though, were the mosquitos. I don't generally get bitten too much in Madison, but they were out in full force in that particular location! Perhaps having a bottle of Off! or some citronella candles would help."}
{"text":"Monday, Ruben excellent, Lady Luck excellent,  service excellent, really enjoy the baby spinach salad instead of fries, allows this old guy to enjoy another beer;)"}
{"text":"Nice beer selection. Especially enjoyed the Fantasy Factory IPA (came recommended by a know. Beer Fiend)  Like the casual atmosphere and we were able to find a quiet corner  !! again, why do restaurants think they need so much noise in the background??  That being said, nothing screams \"I gotta go back\".   Good for meeting fellow Beer Fiends.  Recommend it for those guys."}
{"text":"Um yeah....I DREAM about this place! Love the beer, especially the Lady Luck.  The food is amazing! The grilled cheese sandwich and the summer sausage sandwich are out of this world. Most of the food is local, with meats coming from Underground Butcher. The staff is super friendly and I love the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This is an incredibly tough review for me to write. My first twenty minutes of my visit was amazing. We were greeted quickly and our server was on his game. This being my first visit, my server was quick and informative.  I wanted to know about the pulled pork. He immediately explained that it was not a barbecue pork, but a slow cooked pulled pork. It had no sauce. He further explained that the pork they served came from pigs which were fed the left over beer mash.  I order the pulled pork and egg sandwich. The meal was superb. Can I underline?  I will just, capitalize again and again: SUPERB SUPERB SUPERB.    The flavor of the pork was savory. The meat was not greasy and it complimented the pretzel roll and white cheddar cheese. This was served with a root hash (I chose to put mine on the side) and a spinach salad. The plate was filling without being too much food. I liked the root hash but I am glad I got it on the side. The softness of the hash would not have worked well with the egg and pork (in my opinion).  Now the star loss, the ambiance was quickly ruined. A table of about 12 people was seated near us. Karben4 has a small interior, sound travels, I get it. I am not expecting a quiet brunch. However, I am expecting to enjoy my meal without screeching children near me.  Now before I get some terrible comments, please understand I have no issues with eating near children. I do not expect them to be quiet, however I do not expect to be near five of them screaming. I was not the only patron bothered by this and no one did anything to address the problem. If this were five incredibly drunk people on a Sunday at noon bothering other patrons, I would expect something to be done as well.  We explained our problem to out server. In fact, most people in our area were staring at these children. We explained to our server we wanted to pay quickly and leave, rather than stay for another drink.  If I can not speak to a person across the table, then the problem should have been addressed."}
{"text":"Always great beer and a pleasant patio, and now the food offerings have expanded and are quite tasty, so \"hooray!\""}
{"text":"When a brewery's pale ale and IPA tastes the same, there's some laziness going on. They were out of the Tokyo Sauna because they didn't have time to make it. Wtf? The peppadew poppers are a waste of money. Cherry tomatoes, cheese, very little bacon and some burnt salty chards of something on top. The only thing that saved the bacon flatbread pizza was the basil I added to it. So greasy and BASIC! Food took forever, nothing was comped. Tip to the restaurant: when YOU take way too long to make food for your customers comp them at least a $5 drink. You are looking pretty unorganized and cheap to me. I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I am not a huge beer drinker though I will drink it socially. However, the Fantasy Factory blew my mind and made me rethink about beer many times over. We arrived late at around 10:30pm after a long flight from the West Coast and yelped any place that was on the way to our bed and breakfast. We're so glad we came here! Not only was the beer amazing, but the quiet atmosphere and delicious appetizer foods were exactly what we needed in our starved, tired state. If I have a chance to return to Madison I will definitely return, or at the very least search for the Fantasy Factory IPA."}
{"text":"Great beer and friendly service.  Just needs a little more atmosphere.  A little dark and needs some decoration.  Old Ale Asylum location!"}
{"text":"Karben4 is Sexy. As. Hell. Or at least that's how they describe one of their beers.  A local Madison brewing company, Karben4 boasts a Christmas-lighted patio and variety of delicious treats. A group of friends and I enjoyed their beer, appetizers, and main dishes. It was the perfect place to spend a Sunday evening.  Only complaint is that service a little slow and disjointed. Otherwise, our experience was great!"}
{"text":"Like the fantasy IPA and black IPA a lot. Very solid. Beers rule over everything else. I am leaving smelling of a curry form as there is little air movement there and the music reminded me of Ron burgundy rocking the jazz flute. Props to having cards against humanity on the table we were at. Great game."}
{"text":"By moving into the place formerly occupied by Ale Asylum, Karben4 had rather big shoes to fill.  I think they did pretty well.  Last weekend, I did a fun little \"bike and brew\" tour in Madison that ended with a pair of flat tires and an awful 4 mile walk back to my apartment. Our first stop was Karben 4.  Gone are the big pool table and comfy couches, and it's been replaced by sweet art up on the walls (which is apparently for sale!) and a super-chic overall bar style.  Tried a few beers and ordered a pretzel.  The beer was excellent--really. The Fantasy IPA (or something like that) had a great hop character, balanced well, went down beautifully. The barleywine, which one of my friends got, was outstanding--far lower ABV than I'm used to, but quality was excellent.  Pretzel was alright--it came in a fancy shape and half was soft and the other half hard. Personally, I prefer all soft pretzel when ordering so it was a little disappointing. Delicious mustard.  Our bartender was awesome...and she gave us the highlight of the day: a beer milkshake. No, it's not on the menu, and no, you won't be able to get it if you go in, but it was ice cream blended with the smoked porter...which was on nitro. I'm usually anti-nitro, but it worked really well for the smoked beer.  Karben4 was great. I'll be back...on a bike...soon."}
{"text":"Best craft brewery in Madison area maybe state!  Food limited but good quality and NOT typical WI bar food! Yea!  Service away from bar not always good - parking sucks - or else 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Karben4 makes some of my favorite beer, not just here, but anywhere.  Fantasy Factory IPA is on my short list of favorites, along with Nightcall Smoked Porter, but, really, everything I've had is superb and worth a try.  If you're lucky enough to be there when one of their limited release brews is pouring, do yourself a favor and have a taste.  There's not one all the time, but they have a nice seasonal rotation and some one offs.  Memorable entrants includes Oaktoberfest, Clown Nose Scotch Ale, and Idiot Farm Imperial IPA.  And you have to try their coffee stout when it returns - a collaboration with the folks across the street at Just Coffee (who happen to be my favorite roaster too, a match made in heaven!).  There's often something on nitro tap, which gives you a new look at a beer.    Karben4's menu is kind of a modern twist on bar food, made with lots of local providers like Underground Meats, Stalzy's breads, and their beers make appearances in several food items.    This is another of Madison's local places where the staff shows their pride in what they're doing.  They're happy to pour you a taste if you're having trouble deciding what to order.  I was sitting at the bar with a Lady Luck (their Irish Red) from the nitro tap, next to someone drinking the same beer from the regular tap, and the bartender gave us each a sample of the opposite beer to compare.    I'm always a bit surprised how many \"beer people\" know of K4 but haven't been there yet.  Then you tell them it's in \"the old Ale Asylum,\" and they nod in understanding.  They've really transformed the place and made it their own, though, it's a much brighter, more open-feeling space (not that there was anything wrong with the Asylum, they have their own very cool style, as does Karben 4).  If parking is full, keep going down the lot, there's more space at the end.    Superb beers, delicious food, and great atmosphere.  Definitely one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat here, but their menu looked exceptional (even had some great veggie options)... However I loved the atmosphere and their beer was the best I had on my trip to Wisconsin... Worth a stop (or a few stops) without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, pleasant staff.  Many great appetizers and beer to choose from!  We ordered salami, cheese and cracker board.  A seasonal session and IPA.  The session was so good we walked out with a growler of it!  Keep brewing awesome beer!"}
{"text":"This Five-Star is for the aaaaaah-mazing Champagne Tortoise brew!! I SO WISH this was a standard at pubs around town instead of Fantasy Factory!!! This is a wonderful English Ale with a refined flavor and superb color! I'm also a big fan of the Sunday Brunches here...fab menu that is always getting updated!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in an industrial park. The beer was good and the food menu is fresh and innovative, but the portions are small (although well priced) and my sweet potatoes were a bit crunchy.  It was worth a visit to be sure."}
{"text":"Brunch review: Who knew Karben4 had brunch? Not me until I read Steve L's review!  Now that I have a decent sampling of their brunch I can honestly say it is very good. Much more than I ever expected! The menu options are small, but I'm sure you can find something you will enjoy, because everything that has come out on my plate has been very enjoyable.  My suggestion on what to order: The Tiny Tim (it's not tiny). This will give you an overlay of all the greatness karben4's kitchen is going to cook up for you. It was enough for me to take a giant breath toward the end and say...I need to stop I'm so full.  The Tiny Tim is half the Biggie Breakfast which is Three slices of French toast with fruit compote, three fried eggs*, 4 slices of bacon, 4 slices of ham, open-face pulled pork and egg with root vegetable hash and a baby spinach salad.  Yum, Yum, Yum!!!!! The pulled pork & bacon are amazing! Full of flavor and cooked exactly how I would want any pulled pork done. Great job Karben4!!!!!! They also offer bloody Marys' and their beer mimosa. I like the bloody, but my brother was creative enough to try their beer mimosa (and let me sample it as well)....not my liking, but worth trying because it is something new for your taste buds. Plenty of parking! Easy to find off Stoughton Rd.  Brunch @ Karben4!!!!!! Do it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Killer food, beer and staff. Passing by Madison and decided to stop by. Happy I did! Let's point out their Fantasy Factory might be one of the best designs on a beer!"}
{"text":"Karben4 was one of the first brew pubs my wife and I visited after moving to Madison. After our visit we started to worry that the restaurant quality throughout Madison would be this disappointing. Luckily, Madison has an amazing restaurant scene.  Karben4, I have heard so many amazing things about you. Alas, I do not think I even want to be friends with you. Your beer has an amazing reputation, and you sound cool when strutting your stuff (serving your beer) at other bars. Sadly, your stuff doesn't strut around as well when it is at home wearing boxers and eating cheese product on the couch while watching reruns of Friends. I'm sorry, but you dropped the ball.  Karben4 has clean, innovative graphic design that I can appreciate and a reputation to match. Unfortunately, their home facility is bleak, industrial, and could be cleaner.  I understand why the beer is so appreciated around Madison and the Midwest. Sadly, they do not have the variety that I desire. If you like hoppy IPA beers, great, go drink many of Karben4's brew. The taplist is small and lacks variety for people who don't appreciate hoppy beers. Sorry, wheat and lager drinkers.  My main issue with Karben4 is the service. I understand you have a small kitchen, but that is no excuse to make a table of two wait an hour and a half for a sandwich. You weren't even at half capacity! Our server was extremely rude and inattentive. We both had empty beers and water glasses after initial service, and we were not visited the entire time we waited. I had to flag the server down to ask if it would be much longer and to get more water after 60 minutes. She snapped about it not being her fault and the issue is the small kitchen. Once we had our food, we were never asked how it was or if we needed anything.  The food, was below standards. Our bread was soggy and the sandwiches did nothing innovative. Meh."}
{"text":"Completely loved this place. My waitress was very helpful and attentive to my needs. The food menu was a lot more extensive than I'm used to for a brewery (not to mention that they had a LOT of vegetarian options). There's inside and outdoor seating. Their bathroom was very clean and stocked with some toiletries which I as a female GREATLY appreciate. There was a seemingly large parking area and over all I had a phenomenal experience. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Fantasy Factory on tap. Not sure any more needs to be said about this place. Oh yeah, their other beers are pretty darn good as well."}
{"text":"My top tier ipa was 90 min. Ipa by dogfishead, then I found this gem.... locally!  FANTASY FACTORY!!! This is my TOP beer, any occasion, any! The brewery is awsome as well, very vibrant and the food is very unique! I am so fortunate to have such great beer minutes away, keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Fantasy Factory IPA rocks!  I ordered this beer in a restaurant and just loved the photo on the front of the bottle.  2 days later, we were in Madison and I stopped in to the brewery and bought the T-shirt with the fantasy factory photo on the back.  The food menu looked awesome, but I couldn't get my family to eat here because of the time of day.  I didn't try any other beer, but I am guessing that it is all good!  I will be back next time in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing beer!!! We got a flight of everything and a pint of their beer of the day. Not one disappointment in the bunch. Every single one was worth talking about, savoring and coming back to. The ambiance was just ok... It kind of felt like it was missing something? Too little on the walls, that kind of a thing. Music was decent. They have a nice looking patio area which we were excited to check out but a woman was smoking there and we didn't want to expose our baby to it. I love that they're family friendly by the way! The location is odd - very industrial, totally out of the way (supposedly near the airport, though I wouldn't know since we didn't use it). Worth the trip if you're interested in local, top of the line craft beer."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the tasty food at Karben4. We are quite familiar with the beer (Fantasy Factory IPA is a favorite), but didn't expect too much from the food. Surprisingly delicious!! We entertained the kids with the many board games available during our lunch. Loved the artwork on the walls...each one done for a beer release. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love, love, loved this brewery. The atmosphere was super cool big but not too big. It's been a long time since I had a tasting flight and legit liked all the beers. Their food was equally as good. And I had to get some gear while I was there, I mean a cat with a gun riding a unicorn..lol"}
{"text":"Parking is pretty hard to find on a Wednesday at 4pm. Place is a little different from the typical brewery in that they serve more fresh exotic type meals rather than burgers. The food is pretty exceptional,  beers are very good as well.  Midwest Sope was pretty tasty. Would come back just not with my burger grill craving friends."}
{"text":"I enjoy Karben4's beer.  So much, that I came all the way over to the East Side to fill up a growler. The bartendress took a look at my growler and said \"we can't fill this if it doesn't have a government warning label on it.\" I was totally confused. I've gotten this growler filled multiple times in multiple other places across Madison without any issue. She wouldn't fill it. She offered to sell me one of Karben4's growlers, but no-go on filling my own, which is a Portland Growler Co. growler. \"Maybe you can go home and print off a label.\" That's it. Sayonara.   So now I'm home, and trying to find any real literature regarding these filling laws. The best I can figure is that they are completely misinterpreting the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's (TTB's) laws, which state that closed sealed containers sold by the brewery need a federal warning label. It also clearly states, on their website that growlers brought in which are not prefilled are considered open glasses and do not require the label. \"  So wise up guys. Stop refusing to sell people your beer. And, of course, if you can demonstrate information proving otherwise, I'm happy to remove this review."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to a visit for a long time. They make one of our favorite of our favorite IPAs and it was a real treat to visit twice while we were in Madison. A bit out of the way by the airport but worth the trip.  Fantasy factory IPA is the star. We also tried the coffee stout, oatmeal stout and black IPA. Can you tell Im a dark beer fan?  All were top notch! They also serve food. We had brunch on our way out of town. Very tasty! Waitstaff and bartenders were all friendly and helpful.  Cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"We went here after Ale Asylum so my memory is foggy and my perception was already altered by the time that I entered the building. Great beers though. I don't remember what I ate but it was good."}
{"text":"Wow.  The beer was really good.  Appetizers of pretzel sticks with cheese and apples with walnuts, cranberries and cheese were both really good.  Dinner is sandwich type fair but was unique and really tasty.  Really happy we stopped here!"}
{"text":"Passed through Madtown and found this place (good reviews and conveniently close to the freeway). Loved the beer choices (although bummed that two that I wanted to try were gone). Good food choices -- even the beets were good. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Wish they had better food, but the beer is great!  Also kind of sucks that their location is so close to a busy road.  I went there for brunch and sat outside last weekend and the traffic noise was pretty annoying."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and place to just hang out. It feels less like a brewery and more like a bar, possibly a pub.  Foodwise, the salami board is pretty good. There's a small selection of sausages from Underground, a good amount of cheddar, a couple spreads, a drizzle of mustard, and almost enough crostini. They could do with providing a little more crostini because it's just not enough for the board. While the board is one of the more expensive items of the menu (many entrees could be had for about $7).  Beerwise, they've got your typical lineup pretty much. Nothing exciting or cool or special, really. Sort of a lowest common denominator approach. Your run of the mill offerings. What they do with those offerings is a little better than most though. So if you're into that, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The beer at this place is outstanding!  Also the bartender was really great, we had our 2.5 year old son with us (because we are classy like that). And she gave him popcorn and chatted with him which kind of made his day."}
{"text":"Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes.   Yes.  I tried the Silk Scorpion (which is a good beer, just not the sort of flavor profile I was looking for at that moment of time), the Block Party, and the Undercover. I wish I had ordered the Undercover as my first beer because I'd have stuck with that. The Block Party was good, but the undercover was just that much better. They are doing something right out there in the middle of nowhere/east side. I hope they start distributing more around the area, as I don't like to have to haul myself many miles across town for a tasty beer.   The interior gives the feel of a warehouse with high ceilings; there is some interesting art on the walls too. Some of the walls are still which gives it an odd industrial feel but I am sure with time they will find something to fill the vast space with. Friendly bartenders. Very clean. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the little brewery that COULD.  After a long day of climbing and hiking at a couple state parks we were chomping at the bit for good beer and dinner.  Madison is a haven for breweries but I was looking for something new and off-cuff.   Their food menu is large enough to find a little something for anyone.  I watched many delicious looking dishes be brought out by servers but none sounded better than a good old fashioned BLT.  The sandwich itself was great and the side was a fresh spinach salad.  Bacon and fresh greens are sorta my thing, and they provided both in expert style.  Our server was a really helpful guy who helped me out with their beer selection.  He brought out two samples: Idiot Farm and NightCall and talked me into Block Party, which was easily my favorite of the three. So much so that I polished off the first glass in a couple minutes and had a second moments later.  Block Party sort of reminded me of a 312 but a lot better in taste.   We sat outside which is always a perk for me, but they also have a nice selection of indoor seating.  Inside they also have large canvas portraits of each of their beer labels, which were made by a local artist.  If you're in the mood, also note that they have a bunch of board games to take to your table and play.  Look, we could have chosen a popular conglomerate brewery like the one on the other side of the airport.  Sometimes you have to give the little brewery a whirl and see what they're all about.  I couldn't have chosen a better brewery to visit yesterday, Karben4 Brewing is top notch.  Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Getting 3 stars, because frankly, it was average. Beer was good - but you are a brewery, it should be good.  Service was alright, not overly attentive or charming, but she brought me more beer when I asked.   I'm not sure I would venture out this far again for a beer, but I'm glad I went."}
{"text":"Finally made it over to Karben4 for sunday brunch and it was worth the drive!  Everything on the small menu sounds amazing and everything me or my companions ordered rocked.  I got the Monte Cristo, which was fabulous. The French Toast was perfect and the ham was good quality. The egg was a perfect amount of runny.   They offer a combination platter (can't remember the name) that also comes in a half sized version, the Tiny Tim. Don't be fooled by \"half sized\" - it comes with so much food and is a steal! You get the pulled pork sandwich, ham, greens and French toast with a fruit compote. It's about the same price as if you just ordered the pulled pork sandwich (very good, by the way) by itself!   Friends ordered their special mimosa, which is juice mixed with their IPA. Not a fan of IPAs myself but my pals really enjoyed this."}
{"text":"Swung by while passing thru. The beers we sampled were well executed and tasty. Food options were also pretty outstanding.  I dug the art on the walls."}
{"text":"Good beer as always. Wish they would have some other brew besides IPA though as they aren't one of y favorites. Fun atmosphere if you come in with friends as they have some games you can play."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped in for lunch on our way to Ale Asylum. So very glad we decided to stop. Had a barrel-aged Night Call smoked porter that was just tapped and it was amazing! So tasty and warming! They had some other beers I would have liked to try. Could have gone with a flight, but I certainly don't regret my pint of barrel-aged Night Call!  The food was great. Not a huge menu but a nice selection of apps and sandwiches. I had the BLT and the Tomato, Pork, & Veggie soup. Both were really good. The bacon on the BLT was amazing and I loved the aioli on there. The hubby really liked his Midwestern Sope with spinach salad also.   Tap room was great; nicely decorated with some cool artwork. There were also games galore to play. I could see spending several hours there and having a great time. We'll be back and have already recommended Karben4 to friends and will continue!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. For starters, I didn't like the parking.  You could not park in front of the place since there were few parking spaces in what looked like a little mini mall.  You parked     in the lot on the side of the building.  No big deal, but just a little annoying.  The place itself was nice on the inside and looked clean.  Service was ok.  I tried one beer, champagne Tortoise, which was described as an english mild ale.  It tasted ok, but not one that I would try again.  As for food, the only thing I tried was the pretzel with mustard.  The pretzel tasted like the ones you buy frozen and heat up.  Not very good.  I'm sure their food is good, just not the pretzel.  I would have to say I probably would not go there again."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a weekend birthday trip to Madison.  We had a couple of beers, the pretzel, and the chips and dips.  In about 6 hours, we both had terrible chills, a headache, nausea, and the spins.  The illness hit us both at the same moment (which tells me it is foodborne illness, not a virus).  We sat at the bar by the kitchen and can't say we ever saw a bartender or cook wash his/her hands.  We also saw cold foods shuffled around from coolers to kitchen, so who knows what is going on in terms of food safety."}
{"text":"Karben4 beer is something I greatly miss now that I live on the west coast. If you guys ever want someone to distribute Karben4 beer in Santa Cruz, CA... you guys just let me know. ;)"}
{"text":"We visited last night but I waited to write the review because I was so thoroughly annoyed with the experience that I didn't want to write a review with a hot head. The service was BAD. Bad, bad, bad. Five adults + 1 well behaved child in our party. We ordered pretty simple stuff, from the Reuben to Margherita pizza to sliders and soup and sandwich. The soup and sandwich was apparently delivered to the wrong table, so one person didn't get her meal until everyone else was done. And the deviled eggs appetizer wasnt delivered by the time the missing soup and sandwich finally came, so we asked for it to be canceled. Seriously.  How many times do you have to ask for glasses of water? Or a pitcher of water? We were thirsty. Thought a pitcher would make it easier on the waitress. But after 3 requests we went to the bar to get the water ourselves. Fail.   Maybe they were busy when we walked in but the place cleared out while we waited. Didn't change anything. The bad service we got when we arrived was the same bad service we got at the end.  The bill: you'd think the late arriving meal would have been comped, right? Oh no, it was boldly added to the bill. While most of us had had enough of the madness and couldn't wait to GTFO, one person in our party had enough stamina to insist it be removed. And another person in our party (the same person whose meal was MIA), was a former server who refused to stiff the waitress on a tip. So the 10% tip we left was a gift from the unexpected bleeding heart in our party.  And upon review of the receipt today, the person who got the sliders never asked for nor got a soup upgrade -- but we were charged the extra $2 on the bill.  Overall the food wasnt bad, but it wasn't good enough to make up for the terrible experience! Whatever efforts the kitchen staff made were blunted and reversed by the server last night.   Agree with Kelsi B and Chy L and Dan M (whose review was from June 2015!) on lackluster service -- refer to their reviews for other perspectives. The problems from 2 years ago persist.  Sorry, millennials -- this place poorly represents you -- and the place as a whole poorly represents the Madison restaurant scene. Go to Ale Asylum, instead. There's a reason why they moved on up to a bigger and deluxe space on the east side."}
{"text":"If you're going here for the beer and atmosphere, this place is great!  Fantasy Factory is obviously excellent and a very well known beer in Madison, and the others on tap here are great!  However, they should not be doing food.  We got the jalapeno poppers WHICH ARE COLD.  It says it on the menu, which we overlooked clearly, and they were just not something you want to eat.  It's a raw jalapeno with cheese spread in it.  We tried the pretzel sticks, delicious!  The dip is very tasty.  Every brewery should have decent pretzels.  We were still hungry so we got the flatbread, it was ok, as good as a Tombstone made at home for less the price.  My boyfriend was still hungry when we left but were sick of spending money, so we stopped at Wendy's :("}
{"text":"amazing beer, but the food is waaayyy too expensive. sandwich, soup, and 2 beers is 24 bucks. expect more for the food price."}
{"text":"Beer selection was not all that happening and the appetizers were blah and over priced.   The pretzel rods were over done almost burnt and the cheesy sauce was so watered down it wouldn't god to the pretzel.  The overall vibe and brewery was nice."}
{"text":"Beer is solid, food offerings the night our group was there were a little off. Not as tasty as others have told me about. I'm all for going back and trying more of the menu offerings, especially when there's trivia. The space lends itself well to it, and Amy who hosted the night we were there ROCKED!"}
{"text":"Karben 4 is in the oddest lil strip one could ever see. It's a section of town I would call mid-industrial-ish. The parking is odd but once you walk in you'll forget exactly where you are.   Karben has a good vibe and a cool aura to it. The industrial montage is gone and you realize your in a funky, hip, and happening place. The beer selection is impressive and I enjoyed a few really great brews. They have a sampler that is second to none.   The food the kitchen chefs up is very impressive as well. The deviled eggs, particularly the maple bacon is beyond words scrumptious. We will be back to Karben for sure if were in Madison. Hopefully though, they one day outgrow this space and get into an area of town that matches what they have going on all around."}
{"text":"Karben4 makes awesome beer. I think they're my favorite local brewery, and everything I've tried of theirs so far I've liked. They have a great space, and they've used it really well. There are many tables and cozy booths, as well as some comfy looking armchairs and lots of bar space. They've got TVs if you come to watch sports and free popcorn. Also, they have games!   They offer some snacks as well as a full menu of food. We just tried the salami board, so I can't really comment on how their food is. The board we got had a selection of Underground meats sausages and some cheese and spreads with some crostini. Everything tasted very good and nicely complemented the beer sampler we got ($2/5oz sample).  This is a great place to come hang out and watch a game or play some board games and enjoy some delicious local beer!"}
{"text":"Beer sampler was good. Food sucked. Pretzel was dry, bland and unimaginative. Decor was sparse. Bartenders were obviously hired for looks and not experience. Eh. I like Karben4's beer, but their brewery is boring as shit."}
{"text":"We arrived about 10 minutes after they opened for Sunday Brunch. Perfect timing. Seems like it was right before the rush. They have an assortment of different size tables to sit at along with searing at the bar. Even have board games for you to play if you want (Cards Against Humanity too).   Onto the food...wait there is food? Besides the amazing beer they have, they serve a very good brunch. The regular lunch and dinner food looks delicious as well.   I ordered the \"Tiny Tim\", which is half of the \"Biggie Breakfast\". Perfect size meal for this guy. The hash was really tasty. They were out of the pulled pork so it was replaced with a ground pork. Still...very very good. The pork they use was from a local farm in Baraboo. The French toast is thin slices so it wasn't too filling which honestly was perfect with everything you get with this meal. The little salad was a perfect portion. I can't rave enough about this meal.   My wife ordered the French toast and that was good she said. I ordered a Coffee Stout and I believe that was just released yesterday. Seriously, this stout went perfect with my breakfast. Just a perfect combination. Really enhanced the flavor of the Stout.   We bought a package of the Karben 4 jalapeño brats while walking out from the local farm from Baraboo. They had a stand set up so you could purchase product directly from them. Very cool.   Karben 4, you will see us again and again."}
{"text":"Ok Karben4 you win Madison best brewery hands down. Recent visit and a flight proved that your fantasy factory ipa isn't  just a one trick pony. I do love that brew but the 8 beers I tried were solid craft beers. Great flavor profiles made me enjoy even styles I normally don't drink. Your Irish stout on St Paddy's day weekend is a winner.   Space is hipster vibe. Fun. Casual. And a bit eclectic with all the giant artwork. Fantasy factory cutouts made for great photo op.   Glad to see you have food menu too. Didn't try that but looked good from what I saw on other tables.   5 stars for craft excellence!  So glad your beers abound all over Wisconsin. Next stop - rest of USA."}
{"text":"Met a friend there for a casual dinner and drinks on a weeknight a few weeks ago.  Service was great- our server was very knowledgeable about the beers and the menu and was very friendly and accommodating. The beer was really good (the SamuRyePA was the favorite, I think) and the food was also quite tasty.  My friend and I had the grilled cheese with apples and thought it was fantastic, although we both wished we'd specified that we wanted it on the pretzel roll. The menu says you have a choice of that or bread and the server didn't ask which we wanted, so we both ended up with bread by default.  Still really good, but would have been even better with the pretzel roll.   Husband had the Midwest Muffaleta and thought is was ok, but not great- although that is really just because it has tapenade and he hates olives (he got so excited by reading the part about polish sausage, ham, and white cheddar, that he didn't read the rest of the description!) . If you are a fan of olives, you will probably love this sandwich.   Overall, we enjoyed our visit.  Good food, decent prices, and unique (in a good way) beer.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Karben 4. Their beer is outstanding. I've tried A LOT of them and have never had a \"miss\", which is really amazing. Their food is also spot on. Nothing fancy but really satisfying and great with the beer. I just feel really comfortable here and always have a great time. There are lots of great places in Madison and so many I haven't gotten around to trying that I usually want try someplace new when I go out. But I find myself coming back to Karben 4 again and again. I can't think of a better compliment than that."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch so our group did not have a chance to try the beer,  but the service was great,  deviled egg appetizer was amazingly delicious,  and the Thursday goulash special had great flavor,  ingredients,  and nice portion size. Recommend!"}
{"text":"On our recent trip to Madison, Karben4 was definitely my favorite brewery stop. The food menu is kind of short, but what we ordered was very good. We started out with the beer sampler, and thre weren't any that we didn't care for. After our sampler, we each ordered a pint. The service was also good - we were here for lunch on a Saturday and were able to chat a little with both the brewmaster and the bartender (who, like  my husband, was a homebrewer to they had a lot to chat about) If we lived in the area, we would definitely be regular visitors here!"}
{"text":"We weren't at Karben4 for too long, but we did enjoy our quick stop for a beer.   I actually had a beer mimosa, which was good, but heavy on the ginger beer. I think next time I'd ask for it without the ginger beer. For a beer, you can never go wrong with a Fantasy Factory, and my husband also enjoyed his Champagne Tortoise.   We didn't order and food, but the menu board looked good!"}
{"text":"Welcoming atmosphere with nice patio. Of course, the tap list is representative of their great beers. No liquor. Food was better than expected. Had the apple cheddar board--relatively healthy and unprocessed. Swift service. Music was varied and not so loud that it was hard to chat. Would return."}
{"text":"Madison, as much as it pains this Milwaukee boy to admit it, you are Wisconsin's new Brew City. You guys are absolutely crushing it on the craft beer tip.  After an emphatic recommendation from an eavesdropping ass chef at a local eatery, my girlfriend and I wandered into Karben4 on Valentines Day. They happened to be doing a special release of their session ale called Undercover that was aged in Chardonnay Barrels. It was solid, but in addition to having a US passport I'm also a citizen of Flavor Country, I needed more. Enter their IPA. Fantasy Factory might well be my new favorite Wisconsin beer. Absolutely wonderful. My girlfriend went with the black IPA called Silk Scorpion. It was also really good. Beyond the beer, Karben4's taproom is a really good hang. Cool art on the walls, TVs around for the viewing of athletic endeavors and what looked like a really solid sandwich menu. Can't wait to return for more awesome local beer and related shenanigans."}
{"text":"Another craft brewery in Madison, not far from Ale Asylum. They have a full kitchen and I got the creamy pepperdew sandwich with chips. Not bad, I think it's pastrami, or maybe corned beef sandwich. For beers I got the fantasy factory, which I think is their flagship, and then dragon flute, also good, and I split the new double IpA- the admiral philliams folly. It was pretty quiet for a Saturday night, but it was still fun, they have giant jenga, and the game with a ring tied to a string and you have to try and get it on a hook in the wall. It can be very fun when drunk lol All the servers were nice, service was fast. Overall a solid time, only downside is they close kinda early, at 10pm"}
{"text":"You would not think to look at the exterior of this space and think Karben4. Stepping inside is something totally different. Nice open space and plenty of bar seating. It was nice to try some of their small batch concepts. the only downside was the service was not that great. If it was busy thats one thing, It was a Sunday afternoon and no more than 6 people in the place. If they step up the service game this would be a solid 5 rating. Just not quite there."}
{"text":"I REALLY dug the Vibe of this place. The funky industrial feel is right up my alley. I loved the bright and bold artwork that was all different pictures but uniform enough to please my little nit-picky heart.  As for the beers I enjoyed Tokyo Suana, Fantasy Factory, and Rey Leys Comet. I would order them all again. The block party amber ale left a weird after taste that was quite unpleasant, bummer since I enjoy a good amber. I don't know if it was a flaw of that batch or if it was supposed to be that way. The pretzel was okay, sort of overdone so it was not soft, but the mustard was savory. Also the presentation was a really nice touch! The group next to me seemed to be digging the cheddar apple plate, definitely going to try that the next time I find myself at Karben4!"}
{"text":"I went to Karben 4 after hearing about it from a friend. My interest in craft beer, prior to my visit, was almost nonexistent. A couple friends and I sat down at a table surrounded by beautiful paintings suspended from the ceiling. We sampled all varieties, including the spectacular Nightcall smoked porter and Silk Scorpion Black IPA. Having never tasted a porter, I wasn't sure what to expect but was surprised by its flavor and pleasant aroma. Additionally, my friends and I tried a few menu items including a summer sausage sandwich and the homemade pretzel. Both were excellent. I recommend Karben 4 to all beer drinkers, period. One more thing, the music played in the taproom was excellent. It wasn't too loud, and I was still able to hold conversations without shouting at the top of my lungs. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and haven't had a beer I didn't like.  The smoked porter was great - the smokiness was subtle unlike many smoked beers.  Today I had their ESB and a black IPA ( I forget the beer names.  The ESB was great, easy drinking with a bit of hops.  The black IPA was one of the best I've had.  They do great work."}
{"text":"After watching our friends play some volleyball down the street talk of some brews began. Unanimously they chose to go to this gem of a spot. They gave me the run down on the history of the location and highly recommended all the beers. They even spoke fondly of the food items that were available.   Their pint prices are very affordable. I went with a couple of pints of Undercover Ale which was very smooth and refreshing. I also had a pint of their Samurale which was also very flavorful and smooth. My wife ordered their pretzel bites, which she loved. I ordered their chicken salad sandwich with side salad. Beyond delicious. The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgable about the company itself. They have growlers available for purchase at an affordable price so you bring some brew home.   Love the ambiance of the place. They have a dart board and board games available to enjoy with friends.   Look forward to going back to this microbrewery again for a growler with some brew and some more of their fresh flavorful food."}
{"text":"Killer beer, fab food, fun atmosphere...a must on the Madison beer scene!  Don't judge this book by it's cover (or facade)...yes it's in a strip mall type building but it's the original Ale Asylum space so there's good juju going on here.   Their food is fantastic and not your typical fried bar food.  Their deviled egg sampler is genius as are their pretzel styx.  The beer is of course also outstanding...I'm currently in love with their seasonal Champagne Tortoise.  If you're a real beer fanatic ask them about their Drinktank Growlers...we bought one recently from them and they are way cool!  They fill it, you take it home and charge with with CO2, and then you have Karben 4 in your fridge with a mini tapper for much longer than the traditional growlers (I posted a picture...check it out)."}
