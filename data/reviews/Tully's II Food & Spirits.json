{"text":"Absolutely horrible! They don't even try to make sure what their serving good! Same as service."}
{"text":"I've been to Tully's a few times now. Couple of times just for drinks (and maybe a pizza).  I've also had dinner there too.  Every time I'm shocked at how friendly and nice the staff is. The food was great! Typical pricing I thought. Overall, I find the experience and food to be great!  I highly recommend stopping in and checking it out for yourself. 

From reading the other reviews, I'm a little shocked. not sure if they went to the same place I did."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome Friday fish fry. Don't go if you're expecting anything better than slightly sub-par bar food. Their menu is pretty large and they offer some good specials, but the majority of what they have are burgers and sandwiches. Great place to kick back at the bar and have some drinks and food. Fast service. Has that \"neighborhood bar\" feel, which I like."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here and the experience was clearly better than most of the posts here but they seem to be dinner reviews. Our server was prompt and did not write down any of our four orders. The food came quickly and it was all correct and quite good. It's a little tricky to get hash browns just right. They did. We sat in back were the are four our five tables and two booths and two very nice big tvs. The bar itself had smaller tvs viewable from every stool. The separate enclosed smoking area looks awesome for a January puff. Not fancy. Far from a dive. I would go back."}
{"text":"My beautiful, biracial, 3 year old granddaughter was out for breakfast with her mom this morning and had gotten some skittles from a candy machine. The 60ish year old waitress got right in my granddaughter's face and said \"well, since you're black, all you need is a hoodie.\""}
{"text":"Horrible service, inedible food, tremendous swivel factor. But, my drink was fine.

Their advertised drink specials are good, but most concentrated on shots and low-end liquors (think Smirnoff for $3). The \"service\" at the bar was hard to come by, although there were at least two bartenders working.  I asked for a minute with the menu, and spent the next 20 minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order.

Ordered the shrimp special which was not very special at all.  Although there were 6 grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good, the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless, watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli, steamed but otherwise unadorned.  At $12.99 it was definitely not a good value.  Plus, it took for-ev-er to arrive. The gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special, and his cafeteria-style serving arrived in about 30 seconds.  That didn't make me very happy for him, however, as it looked equally disgusting.

I cannot recommed this place for anything other than a drink, although the pool players seemed to be having a good time."}
{"text":"I've made a goal this year to work my way down Monona Dr/Attwood/Willy Str eating at every place along the way.

Tullys 2 was pretty Meh. I went on a weeknight at sat at the bar. The clientele here are definitely older, fox news on the tvs, and there was a decent swivel factor on the night I visited. There was a grampa with a 10 yr old or so grandkid sitting at the corner of the bar. Ah, Wisconsin and the practice of taking your kids with you to bars for drinks.  They had decent happy hour specials for rail drinks and mass market beers. After a bit, I ordered dinner of a chicken cordon bleu sandwich and fries. They had some special parmesean herb fries that I asked to get instead of the regular ones because that sounded a bit more exciting. They were not exciting. More like they shook the jar of Kraft parm over the fries. The sandwich was alright. Not horrible, but nothing to write home about either and a tad bit dry. It took me a bit to flag one of the two bartenders down to get a side of sauce for the sandwich. I thought their prices were similar to if I'd ordered a meal from Culvers. I don't see myself ever wanting to come back for dinner. 

There is also a lot of booths and stuff for dining and several pool tables. Smokers may like this place because they seem to have an okay outdoor smoking area with tvs out ther and some protection from the elements."}
{"text":"Only giving a single star because I can't leave less. Ordered the prime rib tonight. It was horrible. When mentioned to the server she did nothing. No manager was seen our entire visit. Very disappointing. I can't believe we paid $19.00 for a slab of fat and very poor service. It wasn't even cooked to the correct temp. I definitely would not recommend this place. Just unbelievable."}
{"text":"Cold beer.  Great homemade lunches.  Good breakfast.  Service is consistently good.  Comfortable bar."}
{"text":"Awful service, rude bartenders. In town visiting family and it's not busy for the game... they ignored me for 15 minutes while sitting right at the bar. The bloody was awful and so asked for something else... they said first thing quick and snappy... well you still have to pay for that. Customer sevice and pleasntless level ZERO. I tip well but yeah... they might get a penny."}
{"text":"The brought burger had a hamburger patty with a broad cut in half put on top of the hamburger patty. The bun on the hamburger was very good the hamburger was very good it was just surprising that it wasn't bratwurst meat patty."}
{"text":"Local greasy spoon, food approaches okay but never come here by choice. Interior is basically just a standard run down roadside bar. This would be the best place to eat in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Near Madison you can do a lot better."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar food. Service sucked. Rank amateurs."}
{"text":"I was here recently for a girls birthday party and had I known what I was getting myself into I would have opted out all together!  This place is for lack of a better word, simply the worst!   I ordered the fish basket, which for Wisconsin should never be bad.  I was wrong.  I was very wrong!  

It was advertised as a fish fry when it should have been advertised a Van de Kamp's frozen dinner.  I mean I could have gone to the freezer section of my neighborhood grocery store and gotten a better meal.  It also came with these really just terrible fries that reminded me of the shoestring fries that my mom used to buy, they were bad!  Oh and did I mention cold?  Oh I didn't?  Okay, then let me do it now:  the food was cold!

I would never go to this place again.  Furthermore, I would deter anyone saying that they were going to this restaurant from going."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that the food was good. Now . . . we had a trainee waitress. I'm a retired educator, so I had no problem with that. The young lady had no order pad. We ordered ice water, and my fiance ordered a cocktail. And off she ran before taking my drink order. She forgot his order, so returned to double check. I stopped her to order my drink. We felt like we may be in trouble. When we got our drinks, they were WEAK! We ordered the AYCE lake perch and received the fish boil. By this time, we wanted to eat and run. When our check came, we saw that she had entered 2 orders of baked cod. That waitress needs 2 things: some training and an order pad. We will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not totally sure why I continue to go here, and my friends asked themselves the same thing this past Sunday. The service here is always bad. Every bar has their regulars but the bartenders need to remember that there are other patrons. If the older, dark haired guy with glasses is working, just leave. Really, any of the bartenders will ignore you but he's the worst offender. 

Tullys does serve decent food and I heard their salad bar is good but that wasn't an option on Sunday. They have a separate area for dining along with a heated smoking patio, if you're into that. Drink prices are fair and they do have specials. My two stars are for that and the fact that they're open on holidays."}
{"text":"Came it at 11:30 at night. Waited about 10 minutes for a drink while the bartender humored his locals. Ordered my beer and the bartender sprawled out my change on the tabletop. One of the few bar visits that I don't feel guilty for not tipping.

If it wasn't for the updated renovations, this would be a 1 star for sure."}
{"text":"Was expecting a decent Friday night fish fry. Got the tasteless walleye. Not good. Had to flag someone down every time we wanted service at the bar. I liked the casual, basement living room kind of atmoshere, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"We have been going to Tully's for 7 years, and always had a very nice meal and good service. Today I had friends coming from out of town, so we took them to Tully's. The meal was terrible!! The rib eyes were tasteless and very fatty. My friend ordered the Queen Cut Prime Rib, medium rare. When the prime rib was served, it was cold, VERY well done, and tough. This was the worst meal we've ever had anywhere, and we were really upset because we've always had a good experience at Tully's,  so we were completely shocked at how terrible it was. When we complained, we were told the cook was the former busboy, and this was the second prime rib he had ruined. I most strenuously DO NOT recommend Tully's."}
