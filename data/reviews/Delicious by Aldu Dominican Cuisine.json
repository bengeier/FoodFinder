{"text":"This is my favorite place to come to for lunch. It's flavorful, hot, and savory. The interior decoration is trendy, bright-colors, well-lit, and shiny clean. The owners are nice and sweet. I always order one of the lunch specials, which ranges $9-12 including tax and any extras. In my opinion, the Dominican flavors are a welcomed break from the typical heavy American lunches of burgers, pizza, fries, or even fast-food chains."}
{"text":"Omg amazing food the chef is the best at Dominican food. I recommend everyone to go here ASAP.
Owners are wonderful they make you feel like part of the family"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and so was the ambiance.  Tostones are nice and crispy and Bistec Encebollado was delicious!  My husband, who is Dominican, says that the food brought back childhood memories when he lived in Dominican Republic eating his grandmother's cuisine.  So glad to have a Dominican restaurant here in Gilbert, we will definitely be coming back here and telling others about it."}
{"text":"Take it from a Dominican this is just like eating back at home!!! Thank you Aldu and Dulce."}
{"text":"Amazing food you guys!!! Everything was super yummy, made from scratch!!! Aldo is the owner and cook, and his wife's name is Dulce (hence \"Aldu\"). You HAVE to try their various Mofongo entrees. It's well worth the wait to cook - about 25 minutes as it's made from scratch. Also try their Canoa and the juices and their tres leches cake!!! This is a MUST go place!"}
{"text":"La comida es muy rica con un sabor exelente  un moro de primera y la habichuela  un sabor riquisima  rodos es exelente sabor"}
{"text":"This is TRULY AUTHENTIC delicious Dominican food -take it from someone that's lived in Dominican Republic several years . The sancocho is amazing with their tostones ! I've also had their savory empanadas - the cheese one is my favorite . Im definitely going back to have more of their delicious Dominican food !"}
{"text":"Great to find a location like this so close to Gilbert which is mostly comprised of chain establishments.If you haven't tried the manikin feel this could make a wonderful place for your first experience. The food is fantastic with good flavor, portions are hearty and staff is friendly. Location is excellent next to life Time fitness to motivate you after you get out of here. Caribbean food is not about keep you fit it's all about flavor and enjoyment of flavors from Santo Domingo. 
The place is super clean with nice decor. They will be adding a breakfast/lunch with a better price point which is probably why I didn't give 5stars.
Would recommend this business to locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"Delicious is a perfect name for this place! I had the braised chicken and it was tender and tasty. My wife had the chicken chipotle salad it was fresh with great flavor. I also have the chicken soup which was also tasty with large chunks of chicken carrots and celery. Husband and wife who owned and run this restaurant are not only friendly but informative. Check out some Dominican food you'll love it. Also make sure you try the empanadas you'll love them too."}
{"text":"This place is slamming!
The people who work here are nice and easy to talk to.
The food has amazing flavor, made fresh, and with decent portions 
Only down side... it's pretty expensive almost every meal is 15 bucks. So if you have kids and it's a Friday night expect to be paying $50-65. 

In conclusion 5 stars on everything but the price"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Our waitress awesome! Very well prices for the amount of food you get. We will definitely be going back! This is definitely one of the better restaurants that offers Caribbean food. It's nice to have this type of food so close! My mamey shake so also so good!"}
{"text":"If you have two hours to spare this is the place to go.  The food was honestly really good but the long wait and the condescending tone of the waitress made it a less than stellar experience."}
{"text":"If you want something amazing to eat, COME HERE!!! My husband and I split a large Sancocio soup with sides of tostones and fried yucca, and we each had Morir Soñando-Fresh orange juice with milk and a splash of vanilla...we couldn't finish all our delicious sides, and are full, and most importantly HAPPY!!  The Sancocio has pieces of chicken and pork, small pieces of corn on the cob, yucca, squash...and the broth is lovely! They are going to start serving breakfast too soon..can't wait to try Dominican breakfast! Oh by the way...the coffee is all from the DR too...I wish I had a midget with me to walk on my belly so I could make room to try it!"}
{"text":"Super BOMB! This spot has fantastic food, and the service is great! Friendly staff, truly delicious food....must try!"}
{"text":"This is a new location very cozy and the Peruvian food was amazing! The menu has burgers, sandwiches, desserts and more! I definitely recommend the fried pork or the crackling Chicken Mofongo! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We're excited to have a Dominican restaurant so close to home. Ordered the pig Cuban, tostone burger, sancocho, and yucca frita. Everything tasted delicious! The sancocho and yucca frita reminded me of my childhood. Service was great and staff was very friendly. Looking forward to trying some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing being from Panama I don't get real Latin food that's not Mexican and this satisfied every craving I had so happy I found this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious is right!  I was expecting spicy, as in jerk seasoning, but this was not. That's a good thing as hubby doesn't particularly care for it.  We had braised chicken with Moro rice. Chicken was so moist and flavorful. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. Also pepper steak with mofungo. Didn't care for that as I'm not big on bacon, but that's just me. Such a beautiful presentation with a flower!  Wonderful food and will be back"}
{"text":"I lived in the Dominican Republic for a few years and this is the closest I have come to real, authentic Dominican food. I got the braised chicken (pollo guisado) with white rice and beans. Delicious! My wife had the tostones burger, which is very creative and tasted really good. They also have Country Club Merengue soda, which if you haven't had before, is AMAZING! The restaurant itself is very clean and inviting with great Latin music. I felt as though I was back in the DR. We will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Amazing home made fresh food with family-oriented staff. 5 stars doesn't even honor this place. Thank you Aldu and staff for great food, staff, customer service, time and friendliness!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I drove here from north Phoenix and will be back. I had the chicken plantain dish."}
{"text":"I came to this Dominican restaurant with my family, as soon as my wife's sister told us about it. I first want to say that, finding a good Dominican restaurant in Arizona is as rare as finding Dominicans themselves. Anyway, while the restaurant is not topically decorated as a traditional Dominican restaurant, the food will make you forget about that, if it does bother you. The place is ran by the owners Dulce; whom is so attentive and nice giving patrons an outstanding service, and her husband Aldo. All the cooking is done by Aldo and if don't see it with your own eyes, you would not believe that he's the one cooking. The food is really good and it has that \"mom and pops\" kind of feeling with how the service and fo"}
{"text":"Very Good... clean, fresh and authentic food.  The Empanadas are pretty good, rice and beans hit the mark and the steak \"encebollado\" w/ sautéed onions was like home. Excellent tropical and Dominican music in the background... very attentive service.  Let's support these guys.!.! :). I'd love to see them expand the facility and broaden their horizons with new clientele..."}
{"text":"I had to take a minute to update because we went back for dinner. First, they do have table service. Dinner was outrageous! We had the shrimp mofongo, steak and onions with rice/beans. Dinners come with a nice little salad and the dressing tastes homemade. The shrimp and steak were both delicious. We're already planning what we want to try next. The atmosphere was nice, friendly, upbeat.. good music, not too loud. The chef came out and checked on us twice. These folks are really nice and take pride in what they serve. This is our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Cute place.   We had the sancocho and the chicharrones de pollo with tostones and both were well cooked and delicious.   Food took a while to come out, but it's usually the case as some dishes are cooked when ordered."}
{"text":"Love the food and people there are very nice! I love that I can order and pick up as well!"}
{"text":"This the best Dominican food around.. from breakfast, lunch and dinner they are authentic and freshly made dishes.. the staff is warmly inviting, and genuine.. Aldu, the owner takes time out from cooking to come and say hi each time we have gone in.. If your in the area it is a must place to eat at.."}
{"text":"Yesssssssssss!! One of the best meals that I've had since I've moved to the area! I got the braised beef, beans and rice, salad and plantains. The salad was so fresh, the beans were seasoned to perfection, the braised beef? Oh my! So tender and perfectly seasoned. The plantains were the icing on the cake, sweet and so good! I'm already planning what to get for my next meal!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Stopped on a Sunday morning for a couple of empanadas to go. They are amazing! No wait at all. 

Totally friendly and amazing staff! Full bar too! I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed my repeated visits here and each time I experience something new from the varied menu!
The meat empanadas are a favorite of mine and worth tadting!
The quaint restsurant is kept meticulously clean and very presentable!
I highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"For food as good as the Dominican Republic come here! Food is very good, try the mofongo it is awesome. A little DR in Arizona!"}
{"text":"If you want to experience great dominican food, then this is the place! The Sancocho is amazing. The service could be a little faster, but the food makes up for it. I was in the Dominican for 3 months and i fell in love with the food there. Every time I go to this establishment, it rekindles my love for Dominican food! Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious Dominican Food!
I am an East coast girl with Dominican parents. I grew up eating all types of Dominican food so I am extremely picky. This place is as authentic as it gets. The food is flavorful and so beautifully presented. They also don't skimp on the portions. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just left Delicious and that it was! Wow. Finally!! A good Dominican restaurant. We absolutely loved it, food was amazing and authentic. Yes, the wait was a little long but, they're making home cooked meals! Way faster than when my husband cooks for me :p also, go to Oreganos, it's a 45 min wait for a deep dish or calzone so, don't let those reviews stop you, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the food here.  My husband is Dominican and is currently in the beginning stages of a food coma as I type this from his \"exquisite\" (his actual verbiage) pork mofongo.  The quality of ingredients, authentic preparation, and genuine care given to each dish is beyond compare.  I had sancocho for the first time and will definitely be back for more.  I can't wait to try other items as well.  Highly recommend!

(PS, if you're hesitant because other reviews say that it's a long wait, do yourself a favor and make the time.  Home cooked AMAZING food of this type isn't meant to be served in a hurry.)"}
{"text":"This place is great! Not having any luck finding any Cuban restaurants in the East Valley, took Yelps recommendation to try this place...Dominican cuisine, while very different than Cuban food, is regionally, similar.

First thing the wife and I noticed is how clean the restaurant is, which is a huge plus in our book! Some of the Dominican meals can take a while to cook, but some of the more breakfast dishes come out quicker. The wait is well worth it! Also, if you have never tried a Mamey, Google it, then try it! Very filling beverage.

Tip: Be sure to take advantage of their lunch specials as they are quite a bit cheaper than other times."}
{"text":"Definitely a wonderful spot with tasty, authentic Dominican/Latin flavor and ambiance. Aldo, chef/founder wants to make sure you that have an enjoyable experience and that your stomach is full. Big screen TV's and a few delightful Caribbean-inspired cocktails make it an even better experience. Now serving Presidente beer!!!! La Mejor Cerveza."}
{"text":"My family and I are Dominicans from NY and always looking for a spot that reminds us of home when we don't feel like cooking. This is the spot! All the food is amazing and the service is even better. All at reasonable prices. Everything on the menu that I've tried so far is so delicious and done right. So happy we finally have an amazing authentic Dominican restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and I'm already thinking about what I will order the next time I come for dinner! I love supporting mom & pop places! We ordered steak and onions, pork chunks, tostones and maduros. The rice and beans were delicious!! I can't wait to have the mofongo and garlic shrimp!"}
{"text":"I am so excited to have found this place. It is hard to find Hispanic cuisine other then Mexican in the valley that WAS missing..... not anymore. Delicious by Aldu is the spot. Truly authentic and filled with all the yummy goodness you could imagine. Come here now and experience it for yourself"}
{"text":"Yummy!  I love how every sauce is made from scratch and the quality of the food is great.  I've never had Dominic food before and now I'm very impressed!  I'm going back two days in a row, I'm hooked!

PS I had to look up where Dominica is..south Caribbean...sounds lovely"}
{"text":"Amazing food, horrible customer service, longest wait for food I have ever had to experience in my life!! 

My family (husband, two young daughters, nieces, nephews, etc) did not have to wait much to get a seat. They didn't have enough highchairs for us and my dtr had to wait a while till one was free. We were ready to order in about 10 min and our orders were not taken until about 15 min after that. Waters took a while... and then the unfathomable wait for about 2 hours! And no, that is not a typo... it was literally 2 HOURS! With babies and all! When we would ask for an explanation, we were told in a rude tone that they only had 3 people working in the entire restaurant and that everything is made from scratch. I guess they really had to go cut the plantains literally from the trees and wait for them to get to the right point. Now, if you're wanting to know about the taste! It was amazing!! That's why I'm so torn... so polar opposites! 

Now, is the food worthy of waiting 2 hours with a crying and hungry 11 month old, 5 month old, and 1 year old... I don't know if anything is worth going through that! 

We did see several people at other tables ask for their food to go cause they had to leave since they probably had a life to get back to. To top it off, I had ordered a mango smoothie from the get go and kept reminding them of it, but it never came. When the \"waitress\" brought the check, she smirked and said \"I didn't get you your smoothie, do you want it to go?\" Of course I didn't... I was done by then! 

Anyways, if you want to try amazing food, you have a few hours to spare without kiddos, and don't mind a waitress with a bad attitude... this is a great place! If not, don't even try going! 

P.S. I hope they realize soon enough that Gilbert is full of families and that is the population they are going to have to cater to....and a 2 hour wait is not very family friendly and they might be losing a lot of clients due to this."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly service. Great food! It takes time to prepare, but it is worth it! recommended! will come back again!  Great little hole in the wall, typical Dominican cuisine, well prepared."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. This was my first time trying Dominican food, and I will definitely be back to have more."}
{"text":"I have literally just found my favorite new place in Gilbert - \"Delicious - Dominican Cuisine!\" 

My husband and I just finished a quick bike ride around the canals and decided to check this place out. It is hidden within the same center as Zipps, Lifetime fitness and Nutrishop. There is festive music playing throughout the location and the entire venue is very clean and modern. I loved the sweet little decor, including the sign that read, \"Coffee and friends make a great blend.\" The service was also great, our server was very nice and attentive. Overall it was a very inviting and welcoming atmosphere; we felt like we were at home. 

We ordered two iced coffees, a shredded chicken empanada and the cuban sandwich with a side of tostones. Words cannot express how delicious every single item was. I felt that every type of craving on my pallet spectrum was reached! The additional dipping sauces provided with the empanada were also delicious and we added it to our sandwich! It was so tasty that my husband and I were mad that we had to share! Although we shared, it was still a very good size portion, don't worry!

We enjoyed our meal so much that immediately after finishing we both said that we were down to visit for dinner. I also can't stress enough that when my husband savors every bite - you've done something right!

The owners will definite know our names because we will be visiting frequently!

***UPDATE - My husband and I enjoyed it so much we came back...in the same day!!!"}
{"text":"We came back to try different dishes and everything was still super tasty. Definitely a keeper!

It was not busy either, we sat down right away and the staff was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a bomb sleeper spot...clean...great food...authentic. Flashback to time spent in the Caribbean!

Tucked away in a quiet shopping center, great date night...quick lunch...or chow down with the guys!

Mofongo is off the charts, Cuban sandwich is a slam dunk, frankly...it's all good.

Get at it foodies, time to blow this place up and get in before it's packed out!!!"}
