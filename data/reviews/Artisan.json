{"text":"Got a few portraits done so far with Jason, towards my new sleeve. Def some of the portrait work I've seen around.  Def would recommend this place. Everyone seemed very nice and relaxed environment.  Can't wait for the coffee."}
{"text":"I went to the Artisan this past weekend and got tattoed by Sara Eve. It was the best experience I could have asked for. The shop is extremely nice, and all of the artists are extremely talented, as well as personable.  Sara did an incredible job, and I could not be happier with my tattoo. I will definitely come back for my next one. 


I did however hear Sara say that she did not enjoy the cult classic \" The Princess Bride\"...I know right? But, despite that one hiccup, this place is incredible. I would recommend it to anyone looking for some quality ink."}
{"text":"My Dad ordered an espresso and I got a soy chai tea latte. My drink was less sweet and more spice than others I've had; it was interesting and kept me eagerly sipping. My Dad also liked his espresso, saying that it was stronger than he thought it would be, but in a good way! They also serve vegan treats from Onion Maiden, which was a pleasant surprise. Very kind customer service and great seating arrangement for customers. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They are always so nice. I remember there owner from Zekes days and he's just so nice. I was a bit worried the place would be a bit too cool and I am too dorky to fit in here but not the vibe at all. Everyone is so nice all the time and welcoming. I love the espresso drinks. My lattes are always delicious. I love the space and that penny floor. I just am super happy they added the cafe. Wish I could afford more tattoos. Nice neighbors. Great addition to neighborhood."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the tattoos... as I have none. But the coffee is great! I'm really impressed with the decor, the friendliness of the staff, and more importantly, the product. I tried the house special, a mocha with a homemade ginger syrup and it was quite impressive. I look forward to sampling more drinks and I'll report back of my experience is anything short of phenomenal. I'll definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"My best friend and I got a tattoo with sara Eve last night and the experience was fantaStic.  We emailed her our design a few weeks in advance and she adapted it a bit and was ready for us as soon as we arrived.  She was willing and happy to adjust the size several times until we were happy with it.  She touched up an existing tattoo that I had that had faded and made the sometimes painful tattoo fun!   

The shop is clean and cool and you feel very comfortable there.   Sara takes a lot of pride in her work and you can tell that she really appreciates her clients.   We had an amazing experience and I would recommend anyone use sara eve and artisan tattoo.

We couldn't be happier with our end result and the entire experience as a whole.  Thank you sara!"}
{"text":"Tyler really knows what's he's doing, best espresso, mocha, and iced coffee I've had in Pittsburgh.

I think I even prefer Artisan to La Prima."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because I was not here at their physical building so I know nothing of the building, but the artist and people are talented and nice/fun people
    I met them at a tattoo convention in NJ and got work done by Nathan and love how it turned out. They were very engaging in the process and helped walk me through finding what I want, how big to make it and exactly where to put it.
    If I lived in Pittsburgh and was getting more work done, I would come here. I don't and I may take a trip one day to get more work done here anyway, the idea of having a artist as talented as Nathan feels good. 
   Long story short if you want good work done come here!!"}
{"text":"These guys are hands down awesome. Each has his own style. Josh Barnes is into neo traditional and traditional pieces. Nathan Mould does geometric and dot work pieces. Josh Suchoza does really cartoony and colorful pieces. Jason does awesome realism and black and gray. I have tattoos by Josh Barnes and Nathan Mould. I also have a couple planned with Josh Suchoza and Jason.

They also have Kombucha growler shop, a small boutique, an art gallery, and a new piercing boutique. Their piercer Twitch does awesome work. I got a couple dermals on my chest from him. They are perfectly placed. 

I accidentally deleted my previous review."}
{"text":"This is my favorite tattoo and piercing shop in all of Pittsburgh! The artists are all amazing and wonderful people. I will never go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Don't know about their tattooing skills. We called and were told the only person who makes appointments was away for the next 3 days. We'd have to call back."}
{"text":"I love this small business coffee shop. My coffee passport let me to this gem. It is really cool that it is attached to a tattoo parlor as well because of the cool pictures. It was suggested to be to get the Mexican vanilla latte and this was the best suggestion ever! Highly recommend this latte!! Whenever I am in the area I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Met with Sara today for a small coverup. She was great to work with. Really wanted to make sure I was completely happy with the design. Provided great guidance on what would work best. Can't wait to get it done!"}
{"text":"My fianceé and I got owl tattoos. Sara Eve was our artist. She was very accommodating. Pricing was very fair. She took the time to make sure we got the tattoo designs we wanted. Every one else in the shop were funny, and very friendly. They were occasionally checking out our tattoos and asking questions and saying they really liked the designs. This was our first tattoos and we will be back again. Dont waste your time with other shops. Artisan is the real deal."}
{"text":"Since they opened the coffee shop, I can safely say that I've been to Artisan 400% more per month often than before. Lacking tattoos or a strong urge to get any, I enjoyed coming here to see the art installations during First Fridays, but otherwise, had no business milling about. 

That's all changed and Artisan has quickly become a staple in my coffee rotation. The baristas  are super-friendly and very knowledgable and the space is chill and inviting. Manual brews and espressos are both expertly crafted. 

They carry and brew Madcap [and Commonplace, I believe] and have a good selection of teas for the decaffeinated."}
{"text":"I didn't get a tattoo here, but I did visit the cafe and WOW!! A seriously beautiful interior and a great, relaxing ambiance. The penny floor and counter-top are so unique, I love it! They did such an amazing job renovating the place.

They offer treats from Om Nom bakery and then have vegan options from Onion Maiden too! I love seeing local business working together and offering their goods throughout the city. They also have local art and t-shirts for sale in the back. 

Tyler was working and put together some delicious drinks for us. He is so incredibly knowledgeable about coffee and his passion for it shows very clearly. He uses a digital scale to weigh out the ingredients so each drink is balanced perfectly. They have a wide variety of coffee drinks, including cold brew, and then other options for non-coffee drinkers like me who prefer tea or even matcha. If you are into latte art, he has a die on the counter that you can roll to choose a design. Make sure you take a peek at the photo album on the counter of previous designs, it's very impressive!

This spot is a great location, right on Penn Avenue, so whether you are around the neighborhood for First Friday or any other time, definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"I've had a list of tattoo plans since I got my first one five years ago, but I didn't feel comfortable entrusting them with anyone until I found Artisan. While I have a tattoo with Nathan Mould in the works (and hopefully someday a famously awesome portrait by Jason!), I took a chance on the shop's apprentice, Josh Barnes, who was offering $50 hand-size tattoos after he did a great piece on a friend. I've done pretty extensive research on Pittsburgh tattoo artists, and Josh's line work and shading holds up to some tattoo shop owners, let alone other apprentices. In several cases, I think that his work is even cleaner than more experienced tattoo artists. While his flash designs are primarily animals (check out his wall of designs for awesome stuff like narwhals and jackalopes), I asked him to design a traditional-style piece based on a character from my favorite film. He executed it beautifully and made all the changes I requested while being honest about what would look good and what would not. The session was about 3.5 hours, and I walked out with a stunning piece of art that has healed perfectly--all for $50. When I told him I felt bad about how little it cost even with a 30% tip, he said, \"I'm just thankful for the opportunity to be able to tattoo people.\" Total prince. I've continued working with him, and he's completely honest about how confident he feels in executing different styles and whether certain images can translate well to tattoos. 

Everyone at the shop is friendly and welcoming. All the tattoo artists have their own styles: Jason is amazing with portraits, and Nathan does geometric and decorative pieces. The shop is in a beautiful old building in Garfield with three stories (they just opened a piercing studio on the top floor)--a totally clean and chill place to get tattooed."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for our morning coffee.  We both had been by Artisan many times before but had never really noticed it.  However it was on our Pittsburgh Coffee Passport and so my wife and I headed over.  The inside of it is quite an interesting place. It has a floor made of pennies, a brick wall and an intricately decorated ceiling.  I am pretty sure they are a coffee shop, tattoo parlor and art gallery all in one.  So that means that there is art and t shirts hanging up all over the place.  For our coffee on this day both my wife and I both ordered cappuccino.  They came out with swan decorations in the foam with spoons made to look like skulls.  The flavor of the coffee here was good too.  My first sip was a little bitter but it quickly smoothed out the more of it that I drank and I enjoyed it.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Artisan is definitely a hipster place but they have some good coffee for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Got my first tattoo here for my 18th birthday 2 days ago. The cafe downstairs was beautiful, with a fantastic selection of donuts and scones and a friendly staff member! I got tattooed by Kati, who made my dream tattoo come to life! Can't recommend this place enough, good vibes, good coffee, good food, great tattoo artists, this is the place to be"}
{"text":"If you haven't stopped here to get a cup of coffee then you are missing out. Not only is the coffee delicious but the staff is awesome and friendly. They serve baked goods from Onion Maiden and have the vegan brownies in Pittsburgh. They do a rotating specialty menu every season with different offerings that match the season. The creme brulee cappuccino is delicious and a personal favorite."}
{"text":"I had a amazing experience at this shop. I got tattooed by kris after I saw his Instagram pictures and they were amazing. I got my knee tattooed and I was looking for an artist for a long time that I felt comfortable enough to tattoo my knee since it's a big commitment. He does traditional style tattoos and even though I didn't want full color he was totally ok with that and worked around it for me. He also is amazing at paying attention to detail. I will definitely be back to get my other knee done by him soon!"}
{"text":"If you're in search of beautiful new ink, or a delicious cup of joe, Artisan is the place to go. All corny rhymes aside, this shop rules go check em out and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Jason Angst was my tattoo artist and he is super amazing! So talented and very kind. He designed my tattoo and made it come to life. It was better than I could have ever imagined. Mel was super awesome with working with scheduling and planning to get me in before I moved from Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places. Where else can you go and get a tattoo new piece of jewelry or clothing and a cuppa or coffee? I have several favorites:
Chai tea
Cafe au lait 
Macchiato 
Latte
The manual brewing and different pots and methods used bring out the most amazing coffee flavors you'll ever experience.
Definitely a must visit local establishment."}
{"text":"I *LOVE* this place. It's a Café / Tattoo Shop / Clothing Boutique / Great place to get work done. 

The coffee is fantastic. Whether you get a plain black coffee or one of Tyler's amazing lattes, you cannot go wrong. There is always a nice selection of Vegan treats from Onion Maiden and Relish Co. on the daily. Muffins, doughnuts, cookies, bagels - but you got to get them before they're gone!

The tables are totally set up to get sh*t done. It's great. Community style seating with sliding pieces of wood to either set up a computer, or open up a good book. Free WiFi and electric outlets on the walls are present so you can stay plugged in. And - there is always good music on. 

To the back right side is a small clothing boutique with lots of great Tshirts and other clothing items that I would personally be too bashful to wear; but would probably look amazing on someone that knows how to rock a style. 

My favorite detail about the place is that the entire floor and countertops are laid in pennies. There's also a special penny message on the floor in the bathroom (fantastic touch). 

And of course - you can get inked there, if you book an appointment. Though I haven't gotten any recent tattoos, hanging out there makes me want to get the Tinker Bell hanging off a lamppost like Gene Kelly, that I have always envisioned on my arm. 

Finally - I have to mention that the owner - Tyler - is seriously one of the nicest business owners in town. He seems to know everyone that comes into his shop, and gives everyone such amazing and detailed service. He is THE BEST, and you can tell that he loves what he does with making coffee, and talking to people. He's a great example of why I love to support small business owners. 

TL/DR: great coffee and awesome owner. GO THERE NOW!"}
{"text":"Cool little cafe and coffee shop. Very nice staff that took care of us and gave us some great coffee and hot cocao. Nice artwork all around and a super crazy floor made entirely out of pennies. Pretty nice  vibe, seems like a regulars kind of place for sure but I would visit again."}
