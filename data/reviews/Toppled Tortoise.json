{"text":"The Detroit-style pizza cannot be missed! Its signature thick crust topped with caramelized cheese has made it my new favorite style of pizza, and this pizzeria does it right! My personal favorite is the addition of sweet ricotta on top. Yum!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name or location fool you. I was skeptical about it being in the king putt but the pizza was excellent, ready on time and staff friendly. I will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"After burned food, speaking with a manager, getting replacement food, and finally trying it, I can't say it's even decent pizza. It's mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I ordered an Argula Prosciutto White sauce pizza, and this is by far my favorite white sauce pizza. I have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years, and I have never found my forever go to pizza place. I loved how the pizza is located inside King Putt, makes it great for the kiddo's to have fun while the pizza is being cooked. I love white sauce pizza, and it is hard to find it, let alone to find it tasting delicious. The sauce was full of garlic, and the crust was nice and light, and the Prosciutto was fresh. Yummy stuff, absolutely recommend to take the kiddo's out and try the pizza all in one location."}
{"text":"This wasn't the worst pizza I have ever had, and I guess if I was Ina pinch I \"could\" come back again sometime. I ordered the white pizza, which was supposed to have more than one topping on it, but when I got home it seemed like the only topping on the pizza was spinach. Also, it mostly tasted like garlic."}
{"text":"It took a second to find as this place is located inside of King Putt, not its own stand alone restaurant.  My boyfriend and I ordered the deep dish meat lovers pizza and the arugula salad and it was perfect portion. The pizza was assembled interestingly with the sauce on top, not underneath the cheese. My preference would have been more sauce. Also, because of how they assemble the pizza, it wasn't \"hot\" when we picked it up and we arrived before it was finished when you would expect it to be hottest. The crust was excellent though! As were the meat toppings. They do add fresh ricotta on top which I thought I'd like but it took away from the pizza so next time I'd order it without since the pizza already had plenty of cheese. The arugula salad was simple but great. The fresh lemon provided to squeeze on top of the salad was great.   The staff was super friendly and we didn't wait long for our order after placing it online. Less than 30 minutes. I'd order from here again with some slight changes but definitely a solid pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered 16\" pepperoni + sausage + mushrooms. GrubHub delivered pizza, no pepperoni. Maybe 8-10 shrooms on 16\" pizza. Called the Tortoise, told they are giving me a full refund. TBD"}
{"text":"I ordered the deep dish cheese pizza. It honestly tasted like Pizza Hut pizza and for the price, it should have been much better. The crust and sauce in particular need to be better. I would go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"The pizza was good with the exception of the white drops of stuff on it. I'm not sure what it was. The garlic bread and spinach stuff was good but extremely greasy. Wouldn't be my go to place for pizza but I might try it again."}
{"text":"We've had pretty lackluster pizza from most places in Vegas; this one is our new favorite. It's our new go-to delivery on lazy afternoons, which we have been grumpily devoid of since moving from Chicago. Crispy pepperoni that turned into the little cuppies, and the thin crust was that perfect floppy-foldable-yet-firm new-york-style joy that is yeah, sure, a little greasy, but in all the right ways. Contained to cuppies of pepperoni, for example. (If you wanted health food why did you order pizza?!)  It's simple, classic pizza done right. No fancy frills or pears or foie gras or hootenanny, just the basics, proper.  Sauce has lovely flavor (seasonings other than \"canned tomato\"! What a shock), there was a great distribution of toppings, more rather than less, the cheese had actually been browned under a broiler for a few seconds, so it wasn't flaccid and white and gross, but rather a lovely gold, and the edges of the crust had the perfect amount of chew. There was enough there to allow structural pizza integrity, but not so much you had a hoagie bun left over after eating your slice.  My husband is crying with joy, and claims to be \"now angry at all inferior pizza\"."}
{"text":"Detroit thick crust is really good . Only bad experience is they did not have their arugula salad . Which according to waiter that worked there said it was great!"}
{"text":"I was here with some friends just killing time and decided I was hungry. As someone from the east coast, I usually have pretty high standards for pizza (at least higher than I normally encounter here in Vegas). When I ordered a deep dish pizza I was told it was \"Detroit style.\" Despite the fact that having no idea what that meant worried me a bit, I stuck with my order.  I was legitimately confused during the first few bites. I found myself expecting the pizza to get worse because what I was eating seemed too good for random pizza inside of a mini golf place. Well, it didn't. The crispy cheese on the crust, the flavor of the sauce, the way it was cooked consistently all the way through... It was all perfect. This is the best pizza I've eaten in the valley... And it's not close. Toppled Tortoise needs to be its own standalone pizzeria, and anyone who likes pizza needs to eat here!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY from this place unless you want extremely cheap pizza for 30% more cost than an extremely delicious Rosatis Deep Dish pizza just up on Horizon Ridge Pkwy and Horizon Dr.   I went here on a whim. Being a former pizza restaurant manager for some the biggest chains in the nation, I don't expect much from pizza joints but I do expect quality control and fair customer service.   This particular place is inserted inside of a mini golf place that is packed full of tweens and right off the bat screams concession stand food for double the price. If it weren't for the singular, stellar review might I add, from the person previous - I wouldn't of even touched this place. This is definitely a buyer beware scenario. The website photos are amazing. Kind of like the awesome fast food commercials that you see on tv.   Ok let's start with the obvious indicator that I was in trouble - I wasn't shown my pizza. This is simple etiquette. It gives a final check by the customer and an employee at the same time. An employee should feel proud to open that box and shout the greatest question ever;\"how does that pizza look?!\".    Didn't happen in this scenario. Instead I got the pleasure of trusting the gentleman behind the counter and making my way home to enjoy a fine cheat meal on a quiet Saturday evening with my wife. Nope. That's not the case here.   The pizza was poorly topped and sadly occupied just about 60% of the box it came in. The best and final kicker is that it was COLD! I arrived in less than 15 minutes from when I placed the order. What happened!!!??   Long story short. I called and spoke with Kaylin (hopefully that is how it is spelled). She gave me a great lesson on how their website describes the pizza and continued to argue instead of ask how she could make it right. Also had to go rounds just to essentially request my money back. (Customers - you can do that. Don't let an establishment carry on taking your hard earned dollars to be left unsatisfied and grossly false led)   In the end, owner of This pizza place - you may not make it if you continue to not care about the customer. Or maybe I'm mistaken by the guise of your location and what it truly tries to pass off as food.   Doubtful.   P.s. Previous Yelp reviewer. Since you vocalized you didn't think you liked Deep Dish until this place. Check out Rosatis, Metro or Pizza Rock. Those are much better choices in the vicinity with proven success."}
