{"text":"I love love their fried chicken wings in fish sauce (canh ga chien nuoc mam). The extra crispy wings and caramelized onions and garlic sauce are great with white rice.  Try any of their salads: the shrimp and pork salad with lotus shoots (goi tom thit) is a general crowd pleasure, the duck salad (goi vit) is a favorite of the youngsters, and the pig stomach and intestines salad with herbs (goi bao tu) is catered to the more adventurous group. For soups, their best is the crab soup (canh banh da cua) which is a specialty from North Vietnam that is not usually served in restaurants, so get it! I ask for the big transparent banh canh noodles when I order this soup. Sometimes they have it, sometimes they don't but I do prefer the banh canh noodles with this soup. I always get the durian smoothie (sau rieng) for dessert and everyone I've come here with also love this smoothie. it's sooo creamy and delectable that sometimes I come here just to grab one to go. Their durian smoothie is blended with condensed milk, ice, and ice cream (maybe) so there's just a faint smell of durian. Still gotta give you this caveat: you have to be able to stand the pungent odor of durian (smells like turpentine and onions to some)."}
{"text":"I usually stick to ordering food from Zone D'asie when I want delivery on Just Eat. Their pho is pretty good for a place you get delivery Asian food from, but nothing special.   For my full MTL Pho Hunt review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré.. la soupe tonkinoise est délicieux Je vous conseille de essayé Les personnelles son sympa"}
{"text":"Très peu cher. Bon restaurant familial. Personnellement, j'ai trouvé que le pad thaï manquait un peu de goût et que la sauce de général Tao était un peu trop sucrée. Je reviendrai c'est sûr pour essayer les autres bons choix de leur menu!"}
{"text":"Le Pad Thai est beaucoup mieux que dans les Thai Express, et toutes les chaînes de resto thai. J'ai essayé celui au poulet et celui aux crevettes, les deux sont très bons! Des gros morceaux d'oignons dans le plat, ce qui est délicieux à mon goût! Si on aime le piquant, sauce sriracha à disposition sur la table, ainsi que 2 autres sauces (une verte et une rouge) selon les goûts. La patronne est simple et accueillante.  Musique quétaine typique des restaurants vietnamiens, sans laquelle l'expérience n'est pas complète !"}
{"text":"I always come here to eat the banh cuon, cha ca la vong, bun cha ca and chao. Their Vietnamese food is authentic. Inside it is old but it is a family run business. There is always people going in and out for their take out bubble tea. The portion is generous and the price is not expensive. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to eat authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"So I came back here after a while so I had to update my reviews. Just because it's still so good. Simple, fresh, cheap, great service (really). What else can you want? It's the only Vietnamese restaurant where they proposed me the \"galettes de riz\". Those are so, so, soooo delicious. It's basically some rice paste filled with grounded pork and Asian mushrooms served with Vietnamese sausage and an upgraded fish sauce. Just note that it is not in the menu and only offered during the weekends...plus it goes fast so it's best to go for lunch.  The Pho is great and they have many other typical soups on their menu. For those you like to keep it safe and conventional I heard the fried rice and the general Tao is pretty good. It's a BYOW in top of that. Maybe not a place to take someone on a first date....But if your date is anything like me she'll enjoy going there on a week night."}
