{"text":"I have been at this location a few times now and have enjoyed it every time. I have been here with friends and family, and we have had different pizzas each time and it is wonderful. I love their Caesar salad, and their paninis are perfect for lunch. This place is even better since it is under new (in my opinion better) ownership."}
{"text":"We've been going to 3 Toms on Craig Rd since they opened... at first we were impressed by their service, food and most importantly, their support for the military.  Unfortunately, it is not the case anymore.  We went there Friday night.. ordered the $20 dinner special and when it came for the check, NO MILITARY discount.  When we asked, the waiter said he'll speak to the manager.  USUALLY, as ETIQUETTE, the manager would come over and explain why the military discount does not apply. NOPE. NOT HERE.  Whenever I've had a compliant, the MANAGER never tries to handle it.  It has ALWAYS been an \"opps, sorry, but you still have to deal with it\" attitude.  They say they are competing against other restaurants? HA!  Try TRAINING your managers first!  Its the SERVERS that saves the \"customer service\" department, NOT the management.  VERY disappointed.  WE won't be going there anytime soon.  Why bother when our concerns are never heard?"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious!   I have had the pesto cream pasta which was good.   The Spinach and Arugula salad was good, but I thought the prosciutto was over kill, it doesn't really need it.   The portions are huge so they are good for sharing.   I recommend the Quattro Formaggi, BBQ Chicken Pizza or Fig & Prosciutto specialty pizzas.  I want to try the paninis next."}
{"text":"A cute, unassuming little bistro with excellent pizza. Went here on Friday for dinner with Husband after what I will diplomatically label \"a day.\" I wanted to get a quick bite and not wait too long, despite the fact that it was Friday nite. So, we thought we would try this place as we have gone by a few times.  First, the atmosphere is very cute. Do not let the strip mall location fool you, the inside has an open kitchen where you can watch the boys on the back toss and spin pizza crusts. The decor is stereotypically \"tuscan\" -faux finish, vines, faux marble. but, somehow, it comes off as cute instead of cheesy. The service was good and fast - no wait for a table and the wine came quickly.  The wine list is abbreviated, but not over priced (one of my pet peeves!), right in line with a nicer pizza and pasta place. Husband and I shared the chicken pesto pizza, which was excellent. The pesto was not overly oiled and spiced well. The chicken on the pizza was also good - chunks of breast meat as opposed to the mystery parts often found on chicken pizza.  Very cute, little to no wait....we will def. be back."}
{"text":"I am just not a fan.   The food is a bit overpriced and it's not even good... lacks flavor.  The service isn't that good either.  And if you are lactose intoloerant, you are out of luck because just about every dish has cheese mixed in.  But really, I don't recommend comming here.  If you want italian food, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Overall, this place is great: great food, great staff, and nice decor. Only downside- it's a little pricey, esp. for just opening.   Since this place opened, we have been here twice. Both times, I have ordered a personal pizza with my choosen toppings. My husband has ordered their bolognese pasta as well as their regular marinara pasta. Both pasta dishes were really good and well portioned (especially for lunch time). As for the pizzas (perfectly portioned for individuals), both were really good  although the second time was an improvement from the first time.   Story: I love proscuitto and arugola on my pizza, as well as mushrooms and pepperoni. The first time I ordered my pizza, the proscuitto was on top and therefore dried out. The arugola had been put on the pizza before going into the oven, therefore coming out melted down. Not the way it should be prepared. I left a comment on the back of our charge slip with a couple suggestions regarding the proscuitto and the arugola: proscuitto should not be on top if working with a regular pizza oven (different than wood burning) and that the arugola should be served fresh on the pizza when it comes not (not going in).   The second time we went to the restaurant, the pizza was perfect which means that the management does listen to its customers. My husband & I are pizza snobs and we both recommend this place. In fact, my husband is having his going away lunch with his office there soon before leaving for a tour in S. Korea. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"I stopped by earlier because I was craving a margherita pizza. As I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed something strange. There were no cars outside. What is going on? I parked my car. Got out. Walked over to the front door. The was a sign that said they were closed indefinitely. I looked inside and all the furniture was gone. What happened?!! I drove by last week and they were still in business.  I still gave them 4 stars because I'm a fan. I guess I'll have to stop by the one on rainbow instead. Now where do I go for pizza in North Las Vegas?"}
{"text":"When I moved to this area, I was excited to see an Italian place nearby (considering I am half Italian).  Although nothing can compare to the cuisine I or my mother make, I wanted to try this place out because of the location.  When I went to this restaurant it was during the week, probably around 7 pm.  The ambiance is nice, basic, but still appealing.  The restaurant was fairly full, but it seemed like the dinner crowd had already came and left.    First, drinks!  The waitress had no idea about the beers they had on selection (perhaps that can be equated with her young and under 21 age).  I was disappointed immediately with this.  She did not know all of the beers listed and could not provide an explanation as to flavors, etc.   Next, food.  I was again disappointed with the menu.  The food looked and sounded good, but the pricing just did not match (we even had a coupon!).  My friend decided to try the chicken pesto pasta, which looked good, but was overly priced.  My fiance and I tried the pizza, although I cannot specifically remember what flavor (BBQ chicken maybe?).  The quality was ehhhh, and definitely over priced.  On to the last, desert.  BWAHAHAHAHA.  Well, they had an amazing looking desert tray that they brought around to the tables.  Don't be fooled!  I ordered the spumoni ice cream and it was harder than a damn diamond.  I could NOT cut it with my fork or spoon!  WTH?!  I could imagine myself being like Julia Roberts in \"Pretty Woman\" when she is pushing so hard to open the shell and it flies across the room.  The same thing almost happened to me when I tried to break off a piece of the ice cream.  Anyhow, I will probably not go back to this establishment.  The food was mediocre and definitely not up to my standards for price versus quality.    SIDE NOTE:  The offer coupons in the mail quite frequently.  Be forewarned as one will offer BOGO, and the other is only 20% off.  They send them out in two different advertising mailers..."}
{"text":"i went it to try this place and the smell of dirty mop water combined with 4 day old socks turned me off.  I didnt even eat the food."}
{"text":"Great little place...and easy to find at 83rd & T-Bird.  I've had lunch here several times. Try their pizzas, Tortellini Salad (lunch portion is more than enough - $6) and Veggie Panini...YUM!  I'm also told that the Tomato & Mozzarella salad is VERY good.  The servers are always pleasant!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza and atmosphere. Their Caesar salad is really good too. They had a great deal during the summer, where we got 2 salads, 1 large pepperoni pizza and a bottle of wine for $40."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a restaurant.com $10 coupon (paid $.40).  Both of us got the Panini and we were both very happy.  The portions were large and we both ended up taking half our sand-whiches home.  Meal came with a salad.  The house dressing on mixed greens was quite good.  Service was a bit slow, but food tasted great.  They even gave us to-go cups which was a nice gesture.    Total for 2 meals and drinks was $27 (minus the $10 coupon which they had no issues taking).  Bit much for lunch, but that was a dinner portion.  They have lunch deals, 6 different ones for $6 which all looked good."}
{"text":"The good: - children get a magna doodle to draw on,  - the wait staff is very nice,  - the restaurant is very clean - it's brand new, so that's expected, - the pasta selection is basically \"create your own\", with 5(?) types of pasta (incl. whole wheat) and at least 5 types of sauces (incl. rose), plus you can add toppings to your pasta - karaoke Fri+Sat night, - the food tastes decent, - prices are decent, if you don't add extra toppings, - unique desert menu  The bad: - the kids menu is on the back of the magna doodle, but they don't tell you that, and it's small - kids' drinks come in an adult sized to-go cup, - it took them almost 10mins to clean up (my daughter's) spilled milk - the menu consisted of pasta, pizza and paninis, not much more, - pasta toppings are $1.50 each, - my canneloni (desert) was pretty bland."}
{"text":"r.i.p."}
{"text":"Yum!  Such good food here and a great location to our condo!   We went on a week night with some out-of-town guests who are major fans of Picazzos. Unfortunately the Glendale location closed down so I looked for a similar restaurant in the area and found this spot.   We started with the spinach and arugula salad which was SO good! I loved the prosciutto and cheese combination. We also felt the need to try the tomatoes and mozzarella (might as well right?) and could have ordered an addition serving for today, tomorrow, and any day you may want some tasty cheese and tomatoes! MMM!  For our entrees we split a pizza (I had none so I cannot comment) and I enjoyed the Mediterranean salad.  Everything was full of flavor and we all left satisfied!  Not only was the food tasty but our service was near perfect!  Our server knew everything about the place and everything about the menu!  He even gave us a tutorial on the awesome plates!    3 tomatoes is a great spot and hopefully in time they can work on their interior and improve the ambiance but other than that I have no complaints!  In fact, I think we are ordering from here tonight!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell ... boring.  For some reason my friends like to come to this place and I've been several times so this review is actually a culmination of all my experiences.  For starters, ever time I come here they only have one server.  I'd like to say the service is terrible but that wouldnt be fair because there's only one person handling the whole restaurant.  The real key here is that the management/owners (whatever) don't ever get up off their asses and help out when the poor girl is swamped. Look around, you'll see lots of parched people sitting in front of empty glasses.  And speaking of management, don't think about bringing a kid here unless you're interested in dirty looks from the old hostess.  Believe me I hate kids in restaurants too but it's 6:00pm and if it wasn't for my friend and his kids eating these mediocre $20 pizzas the place would be dead so sweetheart, yes, you with the grimace, lighten up.  You're bringing the whole dining experience down.  And speaking of down.  I've seen several, several, several kids spill full cups of milk on the floor in this place because the owners refuse to stock plastic cups with lids and straws for the kids. You can find stupid metallic covers for your goofy menus but can't stock a lid. Talk about being obstinant.  OK, on to the food.  Not bad, not great.  Not quite convinced it's Tuscan but if you're lost in North Scottsdale and can't find Grimaldis and you stumble into this place you'll walk away with a mediocre Italian meal."}
{"text":"Drove by last week and it looks like this place has gone belly up.  CLOSED"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and great customer service!  We went there for the first time today and every single dish we had at the table was great!!  Hubby had fettuccine with bolognese sauce.  Great sized portion with fresh bread sticks.  Son had cheese filled tortellini with butter and parmesan.  Yummo!  And I had soup and salad....soup was their daily special of Tuscan Potato and salad was Mozzarella Caprese.  The soup was probably one of the best that I've ever had.  Simply amazing!  The salad was your standard caprese, but with toasted nuts.  Added a great dimension to the dish.  Customer service was wonderful.  Our waiter Matt was attentive without hovering.  He even asked for a military discount for us from his manager when he saw that we used a military bank.  WOW!  That type of service doesn't happen often in this town!!!  All in all, a definite 5 star experience for us!!!!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were trying to decide on lunch. I felt the need to support one of our local eateries that we hadn't tried yet.  Just off of Pinnacle Peak Pkwy and Miller is 3 Tomatoes & a Mozzarella.  We started off with sharing the Tortellini Insalata which was infused with a fragrant basil vinagrette.  This was a light and refreshing starter salad that was a perfect portion for 2.  We are pizza junkies and very picky pizza junkies at that.  So we decided to try the Quattro Formaggi pizza.  This was a fantastic pizza.  It had parmesan, fontina, gorgonzola, asiago cheese, prosciutto, roasted garlic, white truffle oil infusion.  The garlic was soft, and sweet and added the perfect accent to the prosciutto and cheeses.    After devouring more than 1/2 of the pizza, we realized that our promise to one another of \"Honey let's really try and eat healthy and not go overboard\" was a distant memory,  we thought what better way to end the meal than with the homemade chocolate chocolate chip gelato.  It was a fantastic. We shared a bowl of this yummy goodness and there was a small spoon fight at the table.  My advice, order your own ;o)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed our trip to 3 Tomatoes and a Mozzarella.  I went with my Father, Wife, and my 2 kids on a Wednesday evening. The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was fairly quiet with only maybe two or three other tables taken.   My father and I both had the pasta.  We both thought the pasta dish was expensive for what you got.  There was no included salad and there is only the choice of spaghetti, penne, whole wheat penne or tortellini (+$1).   My father wanted fettuccine Alfredo but ended up having to get spaghetti instead.  He also tried to order a brandy and coke, but the \"full bar\" didn't have brandy. I ordered the penne with rose sauce and some chicken which ended up totaling $16 for my plate.  The pasta tasted good and there was nothing wrong with the food, but for the amount of money it cost, I would have expected a salad to be included, some bread served or some more food on the plate. (I would have preferred the salad mostly). My wife got a pannini which included a small salad and it was a more  reasonable $8.50.   The kids meals were well priced, including a drink and they provided a etch-a-sketch type toy to keep them entertained."}
{"text":"Got in for a training dinner before they opened a few weeks ago. I enjoyed the food. Kind of a lunch type place or quick sit down dinner. It isnt high end by any means but the pizza was great and the past was good."}
{"text":"Nice decor, food ok (panini with salad-ministrone soup (lentil with veges),  good service, location hard to find and enter."}
{"text":"Had a restaurant.com gift card so we went to this place.  It has potential.  The decor was pleasant, but it was very noisy, I was hoping for a nice relaxing dinner.  I had the chicken alfredo which said it was a garlic cream sauce.  When I received it, it was very bland and I didn't taste a hint of garlic which was disappointing.  However on the table was red pepper flakes and Parmesan so I added this to it and then it was good.  My husband got the Sausage and Pepper pasta, he said it was good that the sausage was excellent, but was disappointed with the lack of peppers.  I have to comment that I think the pasta was a little pricey considering that we didn't receive a bread stick or a salad with it.  I don't think it would be asking to much to include some bread (any type) with the pastas. My son got just a pepperoni pizza, it was pretty good, I would get the pizza again.  I don't know if I liked this place or not, I was very disappointed with the blandness of my pasta.  I think I would give them a second try, maybe it will be better next time.  The service was great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Went there last week and the doors were locked.  Read today in the paper that they are out of business and Carvers from Bell road is moving in soon. Kinda sucks."}
