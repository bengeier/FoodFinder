{"text":"Came here during their first week of opening for a team lunch. I loved the decor and the feel of the restaurant!  For a new restaurant, the food wasn't quick and when they got busy, service was very slow... But since it was their first week, I won't be too harsh.  We arrived early and there weren't many people so we had great service. They're all very friendly and nice. But as they got busy, they clearly were understaffed.  The food was alright. Prices are definitely high since you're paying for the decor. This is a restaurant I would take a client but would not eat for lunch very often. Their daily rice and noodle specials seem more reasonably priced though! And I'd like to try their sushi burrito next time.  The food was alright. My Katsu was quite dry.... And salad was meh.  I would try them again because I liked the service and hope to think the quality of food would improve as they've been open longer.  I've posted some pictures for your references."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant and the first thing you notice is that the service is lacking, some people being given the wrong orders, long waits for your food or their bill. I got sat down, 5 minutes later and no one came to take my order I had to call someone to get my order. Probably better for take out if you don't have 1hr to spend. They seem understaffed in the front end or very inexperienced. Other ramen places run like a well oiled machine this one they forgot to oil the the machine before starting it.  Food wise I got the basic soy sauce ramen, compared to other basic ramen I give this a 4/10. The egg was not the right texture and was cold to the taste, the bamboo shoot was hard to chew, the soup had an overbearing aftertaste. I would not recommend at the moment until improvements are made."}
{"text":"One word, over-priced.  Ordered the Salmon Chirashi Don priced at $17.99! The quality of fish were fresh, but very thin. Basically around 8 pieces of thinly cut salmon served on top of rice and sprinkled with a bit of nori. I can go to get a Pokebowl at Fairview's Yoi for better variety and taste for $14.95 after tax.  My two other coworkers ordered the ramen not from the lunch special which were priced at $12.95 respectively. I tried the broth and can confirm it was absolutely tasteless and devoid of any \"shio\" or \"tonkatsu\" flavours. One of them commented \"it was almost as if this restaurant went into TNT, picked up an instant broth and tried to pass it off as authentic.\"  I also did not like the fact that the server spoke in Mandarin (?) to us when we were speaking in English to her all along. It should be common knowledge for her to not appropriate what she thought I was just because I looked a certain way. Anyway, it was nice that the lady manager came to our table shortly after and explained to us in English, but was super turned off by the staff.  The restaurant was large and had nice decor, but other than that I don't think I shall be returning."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my husband and we were greated warmly as we entered this modern and stunning decor restaurant. The menu offers variety of food! We ordered ramen,  deluxe sashimi, and deep fried scallops and all the products were fresh and delicious! I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when my friend told me they have $1 oyster on tue, so we went on tue @7:30, there was only our table, couple more tables at round 8:30. The service is great, but the food disappointed us. We have 5 adults and 3 kids, wanted to order 4 dozens of oyster, the manager/owner told us we can only have 2 dozen for $1 each, limit 1 dozen for two people, kids are not included, so another 2 dozen has to be $2 each, and keep telling us that they are losing money doing $1 each, i was like this is not cool, u advertise to attract more ppl come in, but set the condition in spot, so we negotiated to have 3 dozen for $1, 1 dozen for $2, but I felt like why I need to negotiate when u ad for $1 on tue (not saying limit in the ad), the oyster were fresh, they only offer cocktail sauce, I would like to hv spicy sauce as well for oyster. Oyster: 4.5/5. We also order other items, ramen, not impressive, skewers, thick good cut pork belly, was over charred, $5.5 for 2 skewers. chicken karrage, feel like u are eating batter over chicken meat, The rolls, pricy, $21 for their signature roll which is soft shell crab with slice beef and foie gras on top, the ingredient are expensive, but all the flavor didn't mesh well together, couldn't taste foie grass at all.   If only rate for food would be 2 to 2.5, but the service and environment are pretty good, I would give extra star for handling three noisy kids. Would come back for $1 oyster."}
{"text":"We were super excited for this restaurant to open! But that excitement ended too quickly.  We visited Sozo, probably the 2nd day they've opened.  The manager/owner gave us a very warm welcome.  She was attempting to train her new staff.  No biggies, we love seeing that because it shows she cares for good service. (Thumbs up).  To get a breathe of what they got to offer we ordered a sushi roll (manager recommended Spider-Roll), Katsu-Don, and finally, recommended again by the manager, their ramen - we asked for tonkotsu.  Seeing we were the 1 of 2 table here, the food come quickly. The spider roll came first. It was a nice start, the rice isn't warm, the seafood was fresh and the roll seems bigger than average. A bit pricey, but I give 3.5/5.  Next the Katsu-Don came. 2 words. Over done. The egg should be a bit watery. 3/5  Then the ramen came, we noticed right away the broth isn't white-ish. Ummm, then the manager quickly told us, \"we made it special for you ... we added some miso\". My wife looked at me and was not impressed. Seeing it was their 2nd day, I said to her, let's give them a shot.  But after the 1st two disappointments, I was not surprised that this bowl of ramen will not knock me off my feet. Folks, it was super salty. Believe me, I'm a ramen addict :)  I'm one of those who line up for an hour to get into the other more popular ramen restaurants in the city.    This Japanese restaurant is so close to our work and home. Very disappointed. I'll consider giving them another shot with my mother. But my wife will probably not.  PS. Don't move the bowls and plates on the table. Unfortunately, they might be a bit too new and it leaves scratch makes in their table.  We told the manager, so she's aware.    Highlight of the visit:  Ordered tonkosu ramen and they added miso, as a special surprised, ?!?!}*]^]*£}!¥\¥_]+#. Sorry ... we're Not impressed.  Food (Taste): 3/5 Food (Presentation): 4/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Fun Factor: N/A  Free Wifi? No (can use next store)"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to have a new Japanese restaurant open up around home and when I heard that they had a $1 Oyster Special featuring oysters such as Fanny Bay, French Kiss, Acadian Gold and Malpeque on Tuesdays, between 5-9pm @sozo_ramensushi, I had to drop by and check it out. We arrived a little late (around 8pm) and unfortunately all that was left were Malpeques. The oysters were good - fresh and delicious but I was really looking forward to those Fanny Bays and sadly Malpeques just don't make the same impression.  As for their other food items, I would probably pass on the sushi here. We ordered the Supreme Sushi combo ($27.99) and were quite disappointed. The combo comes with 4 nigiri & 4 aburi sushi pieces plus one mango maki (8 pieces). For me, the mango roll was a complete fail. Aside from the slight sweetness that comes from the small bits of mango and mango syrup on top, the overall roll was quite bland. The rice was a bit dry, under seasoned and lacked flavour. The biggest problem was the proportioning of the roll. Over 75% of the roll was filled with avocado and cucumber - both of which have very mild flavours. I would have liked to have a bit more crab and tobiko which would add some saltiness and also help to balance the sweetness of the mango on top. The cucumber was also very weird as it was julienned into incredibly thin strips which left the roll feeling somewhat gritty in terms of texture. For the nigiri and aburi, we were given pieces of kampachi, scallops, salmon and tuna. These were all good but nothing extraordinary.  The Homemade Aged Black Garlic Sauce Soup Deluxe Ramen ($12.95) on the other hand was quite good. The broth was what stole the show. The black garlic added a rich sweet flavour and soup had extremely smooth and very natural earthy flavour. The result was a very homey broth that left a really nice aftertaste in your mouth after drinking it (I really did drink all the soup in that bowl!) The chasu was tender and flavourful and the noodles were not bad. The only thing that needed work was the egg which still had a fairly runny yolk.  The space is large and spacious and the manager and staff were really nice and friendly. However, I do have to mention that we ordered a dozen oysters and were only given 10. When we asked about it, the waitress apologized after counting the number of shells left on our plate. She brought out two more oysters but they seemed smaller and not quite as fresh for some reason.   I will probably be back for the buck a shuck (hopefully early enough to get some Fanny Bays) and the ramen but will forgo the sushi (mediocre and overpriced) in the future."}
