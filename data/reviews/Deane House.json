{"text":"A recently renovated Deane House restaurant is now owned by the same people as the River Cafe, inheriting the Cafe's combination of sophistication and historical ambience. We went for happy hour in the Tenement Bar which is on your left when you walk in, so this review is just for the bar. The space has a large sunlit banquette seating area which is quite nice. Happy hour consists of selected wines by the glass for $7-8, and $6 select draught. The bar menu has about a dozen items in the $12-$18 range, including rabbit perogies, salted cabbage with chicken liver mousse, lamb ribs and more. Definitely carefully prepared dishes made with quality ingredients from local suppliers, and not something to munch on mindlessly. The menu is \"vegetable forward\" so don't expect the ratio of liver to cabbage to be high. They are seasonally revamping the cocktail menu, so we'll have to go back and report. Overall we enjoyed our time there, it's a nice atmosphere with nice food to match, even if it's a bit pricey to regularly hit up just for after work drinks and comestibles."}
{"text":"Four of us went to the Deane House for brunch before we toured Sunfest in Inglewood.
We all enjoyed our meals. Two of us had the eggs benedict with smoked fish and it was fantastic.  I tried my husband's sourdough pancakes and they were amazing with great flavour. The other plate was duck eggs with sausage and that went over well too.

The portion sizes are perfect. The service was a bit odd, with someone in 'training' It just felt a bit over the top for a brunch and kind of intrusive. I guess it's better to have to much service than too little? We couldn't hear our server over the ambient noise.

The atmosphere is lovely, unfortunately we couldn't eat outside because it was a bit cool. The surrounding garden is wonderful and the house is great. A minor complaint would be the noise level due to the echo and hard surfaces in the \"porch\" area. We couldn't hear our server. It also felt a bit crowded. 

I would definitely come back. It's too bad the restrooms are on the 2nd floor as it's a bit tricky for accessibility.

{"text":"Decided to stop here for lunch... came back for dinner. Food delicious, ambiance lovely, both indoor and outdoor setting available. Portions perfect, well presented, and each mouthful tantalizing. A must when in Calgary."}
{"text":"A historic house turned restaurant in Inglewood, this place is perfect picturesque location for brunch, lunch or dinner (and many weddings!)

So it's no question that they are highly sought after for brunch, and I really appreciate that the Deane House takes reservations. 

We trekked through a snowy morning and nestled in with some teas and London Fogs while we studied the menu. I honestly had a hard time choosing! The breakfast items that caught my eye: saskatoon berry sourdough pancakes (with lemon balm, maple syrup and chantilly cream), the smoked arctic char eggs benny and the croque madame. Ultimately, the asian twist on the duck confit perogies won me over (braised red cabbage, fermented squash and beet dashi).

Although very delish, the sour beet and cabbage offset the richness of the duck well, I felt the portion was quite small (five perogies is more of an appetizer than a meal). I foraged a bit of pancakes and hashbrowns from my dining mates to fill up.

Overall, a great experience with the quality of food, service and view. I'd definitely return and try something heartier."}
{"text":"Finally open and worth the wait. Went for the tasting menu $100/pp and it was excellent! The menu is what the call vegetable forward, which means you'll eat more vegetables than meat, but honestly that is totally fine as you get enough of both and the vegetables are so well prepared.

The service was excellent too. You could tell they are very concerned about their customers have an perfect experience. Our waiter Travis was super helpful and a really nice guy. All the staff was excellent and they even gave us a tour after.

Best new restaurant in Calgary by a mile!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant, and Deane House was the perfect location to celebrate our USA Thanksgiving.  The dining room is simply charming, with an inviting bar and river view.  The food was very good and service unpolished, but well meaning.

The specialty of the house, Roast Chicken, was moist with a nice Applewood, smoky flavor, but weirdly smothered in salad.  The lettuce leaves were huge, and it was as if you had to go on a hunt to find the chicken.  This salad concept was a huge mistake.  The chicken and potatoes should stand on its own.  Scrape the salad \"frosting.\"

My brisket was tasty, but had a Corned Beef flavor, which wasn't bad, but certainly didn't taste like classic brisket.  Because of the food discrepancies, I cannot give Deane House five stars, but it is a very nice restaurant, with a maturity lacking in the 17th Avenue eateries.  Sometimes, trendy gets a bit much, and the comfort of Deane House is quite welcoming."}
{"text":"Came for a get together brunch with my girlfriends before the break was over! The interior and exterior is very nice! The food was good, I ordered a eggs Benedict with Arctic char (hash was crispy and eggs were cooked perfect!). The staff were also very friendly. Note, they charge 18% gratuity for larger groups and water costs a dollar."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the edge of downtown...right as you cross the bridge into Inglewood. If you haven't been to Inglewood lately, it has a new vibe and has become more developed, more trendy and more lively. Including the Deans House, which has been an historic house in Calgary that I'm assuming was transformed into this unique restaurant.

The wait has been long for me to finally see what this House was all about. The restaurant itself is really neat and true to its home comfort style of restaurant.

The brunch menu has plenty of options and items you'll want to try... Such as the rabbit Perogies. 

First impression of the restaurant was pleasant, cozy, and very trendy. All the customers seemed to live a downtown trendy lifestyle...interesting atmosphere. Maybe that's just the Sunday brunch crowd.

Overall, I would recommend this place to friends. A nice location that makes you feel you're at a country house."}
{"text":"Clean bright tidy room. Loved the food. Lunch menu has rabbit duck ...the view and atmosphere is fantastic"}
{"text":"There are just some places that once you try them, you constantly are reminded of your experience & keep wanting to go!
Dean House is one of those places. 
Even the experience of walking from the parking to the front door is so unique & calming.
The place is buzzing during weekend brunch, which is the time when we visited. 
Once you take in the interior chic & elegant decor, you know that you're in for a treat. 

We actually chose to sit at the bar, which was great, coz the bartender was also really friendly. He made us his signature cocktail which wasn't even in the menu. 

Despite the busyness, everything arrived on time with beautiful presentation. 

A must try brunch in YYC :)

{"text":"Went for a lovely brunch for a friends 40th. Really impressed with the refurb they did. We were seated on the porch with a view of the river and it was just lovely.

As we went on a Sunday they have free corkage, so we took 2 bottles of more expensive champagne to celebrate. The waitress was quick to make sure they were on ice and cold for when everyone arrived. Glasses were given to us straight away too.

As there were 6 of us we ordered and then passed plates around so everyone could get a taste. Had a couple duplicates of the below.

1. Soft Poached Mans Organic Eggs, with Smoked Red Lentil Hummus, Goat Feta, Sumac ($15). Great bread, hummus was a spread on the bread and the goats feta was delicious. 

2. Sunny Side Duck Egg, with Toasted Sourdough, Grilled Merguez, Harissa Yogurt ($16). Ducks eggs are delious I discovered and you should too! Merguez sausage had amazing depth of flavour and the yogurt added the right balance to the richness of the duck eggs.

3. Duck Rillette eggs benedict, with buttermilk biscuit and mustard hollandaise ($16). Creamy slightly spiced hollandaise, duck rillette was more of a patty that they had grilled up under the eggs. Crisp but still soft and juicy. Great dish.

4. Driview Rabbit Perogies, with rabbit sausage, fermented carrots, buttermilk carrot puree ($18). This was a clear winner. The presentation was beautiful, and then you tasted the dish. Rabbit perogies are the only way forward as far as I am concerned. A most delightful treat.

We shared a dessert, cant remember which one, but know that it was gone in seconds.

Definitely a bunch on the higher end, but also higher end products and so well made with great presentation. This is the place you go to have a long leisurely brunch with people you enjoy spending time with. Find those people and go.

Reservations highly recommended."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars but this was a really great dining experience!! We made a reservation for the Big Taste menu and were pleasantly surprised at the level of service and the combination of ingredients in each dish. The server was extremely friendly, took us on a little tour of the haunted library and was extremely attentive. I would definitely return as this was a memorable dining experience and a delicious 5 course meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! Loved my whole experience there, we went on a sunny Sunday a few weeks ago and I've been meaning to write a review. I loved the sourdough pancakes as well as the delicious perogies. It was two of us so we pretty much shared everything, we ordered the fried chicken and biscuit sandwich and omg! Its so good you it'll make you want to smack your mama. I can't wait to come back for dinner!
Its nice to see a restaurant with such a diverse wait staff. Absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"Four of us came for a late dinner - and in a word, it was fabulous.

First of all, the house itself is gorgeous and having the restaurant in the house allows for more quiet, intimate tables in the various rooms. We were seated in the enclosed wrap-around terrace.

We all started with an aperitif - there were some really unique offerings. They went down smoothly with the warm bread and butter that was delivered. The other three ordered off the menu (lamb & boar) but I ordered the duck special, which was sublime. I have to admit that I was embarassed by the fact that I cleaned my plate so well that it looked unused!

We weren't planning on ordering desserts but when I saw a pot de creme on the menu I was sold. It was as delicious as everything else that I had eaten that evening.

This restaurant is too expensive to become part of our regular rotation but it is wonderful for a special event or a bit of a splurge."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a date night but we chose it for a romantic birthday celebration! The service was great and the food was so excellently prepared! You can't go wrong with anything you order. We were here in the winter so there wasn't much of a garden outside but the ingredients were local, fresh, and of the highest quality!! Definitely worth return visits to try their seasonal items. 
The House was intriguing and had a romantic yet trendy ambiance."}
{"text":"Great food! Atmosphere is amazing but service was slow slow. A glass was broken and we waited over 30 minutes for a drink. Waitress forgot my wine and then my husbands drink. She was a total scatter brain. We would have to verify what we ordered and ask again. She needs some training. I'd recommend the place based on the food quality."}
{"text":"When my typical brunch spot was booked for a wedding, my friend and I decided to head to Deane house after hearing many positive things. I enjoyed the patio music and the atmosphere at the bar. We were promptly served and quickly ordered. I had the blue berry pancakes and my friend had the fried chicken and biscuit sandwich. I found my meal to be absolutely delightful while my friend afterwards said his meal was  a 2/10.

That being said I am not rating this place higher for two reasons. One was the charge on the bill for water. $1 for filtered river water reeked of a cash grab despite how pretentiously it was described on the menu. Lastly, when I received the bill there was a card stuffed in the leather envelope informing me that I had just dined at one of the top 10 new restaurants in Canada. It came across as arrogant and uptight. If you're REALLY one of the top 10 new restaurants in Canada that story should be told in the food. My final verdict would be that it's worth checking out. Just don't order the tap water."}
{"text":"After my second time here, and another great meal, and seeing my friends clean off their plates, I can recommend this place from the bottom of my heart. 

The food was so good. Creative, but not in an inaccessible or snobby type of way. The flavours were addictive and satisfying."}
{"text":"Finally was able to stop in here for brunch after a failed attempt to come by a few month ago. First off this is the most adorable historic house, it's right next to the river and pathways so it's a very natural setting with lots of great light. We were sitting on the outside section where they've turned the wrap around porch into an enclosed area to sit with comfy seating and a beautiful view of the river. Our server was friendly and welcoming, she kept our coffee topped up while we perused the menu, there was a wide range of choices from classic breakfast options to perogies and sandwiches. We ended up going with the classic choice of pancakes which were delicious, light, fluffy and totally fulfilling and the squash and farro egg dish which was well reviewed by my two friends who tried it. Overall we had a great visit to Deane House, it's a gorgeous place with a great menu. It does get busy though so I would recommend making a reservation before you go. They also have a parking lot for patrons on the east side of the building just off 9th ave."}
{"text":"When the weather's perfect for al fresco dining, there are a few spots in Calgary worth making reservations for. Deane House offers live jazz on their patio during Sunday brunch, so add it to your short list. I tried a sous vide poached duck egg on \"shrimp and grits\" and my wife had oxtail pierogis, and we finished with two different desserts, a chocolate paté for me and a creme brûlée for her. Our servers were attentive without being overly solicitous. Linger, and enjoy an experience you won't soon forget!"}
{"text":"Big Taste gave my gf and I the perfect opportunity to try Deane House for the first time. A few of our friends had tried here before and did not recommend we go but we wanted to see for ourselves. We were not disappointed. The ambience was great, we had a great view of DT, service was very friendly. 

The first 2 dishes of the gourmet menu were good but nothing amazing and we were starting to think we should have listened to our friends BUT the poached egg that came after was incredible. Both our eggs were cooked perfectly and they brought out this nice teapot to pour the duck broth at the table. Every dish after that continued to improve our opinions. By the end of the evening we were pleasantly full (not to the point where we struggled to finish our food) and we will definitely be back to try the regular menu. 

One thing to know if you decide to try their big taste menu next year is the entire table has to either get the big taste menu or order off the menu. No mixing. Which is sad because we actually had 2 other friends who wanted to join us but decided not to come as they wanted to order off the menu. I hope they don't have this restriction for Big Taste '19"}
{"text":"Amazing New Year's Eve dinner experience. We had a 5 course menu and my boyfriend got the wine pairing. We loved all the dishes! I will say though that the rabbit was a little strange. I appreciate the form and the style but I'm not a big fan on pate type dishes but it was pretty. Haha our server was great and timing was on point. The ambiance is fun and I loved that it was an old house converted. We sat downstairs but if we ever come back I'd like to see upstairs!"}
{"text":"Deane House is River Cafe's newest sister restaurant. We decided to come and try it for Big Taste after our first lunch at Q Haute Cuisine. Yes, two lunches. Winning.

The inside is absolutely stunning. The setup makes you feel like you're eating outdoors (without being outdoors).

The Big Taste menu was $15.00, what a steal.

- Moroccan spiced red lentil soup - we were worried that would be heavy but the soup was delightful. The slightest kick. Really refreshing and bright flavour.
- 7k Ranch longhorn burger - the bun was perfect. The garlic aioli was tad too sweet and overpowering but the longhorn was meaty and tender.
- Dent corn grits - corn grits has a very unique texture. It was creamy and gritty (for better use of the word) but after a few bites, it starts to taste the same and feels like you're eating mush. A whole plate was too much. Lucky, we shared. The pumpkin seeds and roasted vegetables gave a much needed contrast but couldn't save this dish.
- Lemon Saskatoon squares - the lemon squares were a perfect two bite dessert. Light and citrusy.

Will have to come back to Deane House again for the full experience. Solid first visit."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. Since we made last minute reservations, we were sat outside. Which was perfect because it was another beautiful day in yyc. There was a wedding happening when we were seated so we felt a little bit like we were in the middle of a private event. A bit awkward. However, no one seemed to mind so we carried on. Location is beautiful. Grounds of the restaurant are well looked after and they have such a beautiful garden. Just note that the freight train is right across the street and the restaurant borders a very busy road. There wasn't any music playing outside so you will notice the road noise for sure. 
We had another adult and 2 young children with us. Not really thinking much of it, the menu was definitely tailored towards adults only. However, the kitchen was kind enough to offer grilled cheese or hamburger with chips. Kids picked the hamburger and chips, which was not a hit. A little too fancy for their liking. The free sour dough bread offered was a nice touch. Do I dare admit that I had 4 pieces??? They offer still or sparkling water, without an extra cost, which I can truly appreciate. We skipped the appetizers and went straight to the mains. Two of us had the halibut, cooked perfectly might I add. The other guest had the duck, another dish cooked perfectly. I do want to mention that while it was all so tasty, the portions are on the smaller side and most main dishes cost $43+. I did end up trying the cheesecake which made me a happy camper. It's a must of you come here for dinner. I also need to mention that the service was great. Very friendly and attentive. It's a must try considering the history of it being haunted and all...."}
{"text":"New favourite restaurant in Calgary. Beautiful location, large portions and a menu that is updated often."}
{"text":"Go for a mid afternoon brunch. This place is so delightful. Server staff are brilliant. 

Our server, Katie, was super friendly and attentive. The food was great and the selection of drinks was splendid.

Hot tip is try the Danish. It's perfection."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever ordered here has been delicious and creative. Quality, locally sourced ingredients matched with friendly, knowledgeable staff and service really make the dining experience top notch. I wish the 2-top tables were a touch bigger, or at least spaced out further so date night conversation was more private."}
{"text":"Wife and I had a very nice dinner at historic Deane House on our last night of our Canadian Rockies vacation. Nice way to spend the evening. The building and herb/flower garden are beautiful. We had hoped to sit on the big patio, but staff called us in the afternoon to switch our reservation inside due to thunderstorms (nice that they called). The entire staff was very friendly. The food was creative and tasty using fresh items from their garden. They try to use as many locally sourced items as they can. We also ate at their other restaurant (same owner I believe), the River Cafe which was also very good."}
