{"text":"I have decided to change my rating after my experience there tonight.  I went at about 5:00pm and there was already a good crowd at the Bar so I sat at one of their booths.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when you go to a restaurant and  they ignore you, and that's just what happened.  I sat and sat until I saw one of the guys at the bar who I saw order his food get his dinner and finished it.  Honestly, I try to not judge a place off of one experience but after waiting for close to 25 min without even a hello, I doubt I will ever be back.  It wasn't even like they were super busy, I watched the bar tender and the other waitress talking it up with all the people at the bar a looked at me but never came over.  I ended up just leaving."}
{"text":"This place is awesome since the new management took over.. Vince and his crew moving to the west side to provide a great place to unwind is refreshing. As most of us west side peeps know, there's not a whole lot of options but now we have one. To sum it all up..... The \"New\" screwballs(99 pub and grill) = LEGIT\"!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday afternoon for a beer and bite to eat. Shared a pizza and an order of boneless wings with my dining partner and was pleasantly surprised. The pizza had a nice homemade crust and plenty of toppings and the boneless wings we're what I would call above average for pub food. The service was good but the place was pretty empty. All and all a successful lunch. I would visit again if I was in the area"}
{"text":"Under new ownership, and I have been invited back. I will give it another try. I really like this place. I want to make it my go to place. Can't wait."}
{"text":"Screwballs is my new go-to dive bar for HH at the end of a heinous work week!  It is in a spot that doesn't get much traffic, so the reviews are true that the service isn't so fantastic...but that's because there is usually only one server/bartender and a person running the off track betting window.     But, the bar food is tasty and the drinks are too.  The bartender, who has been the same guy both times I've been in, is still very helpful and apologetic if he gets super busy.  He stays on top of it pretty darn well for being the only on there.  Poor guy.  The last time we were in, there was a 2nd server and the service was quick and the food came out in a super speedy fashion.    Try the fried zucchini and the garlic cheese bread...sure it's probably just some quick frozen fare, or maybe it's not.  But, there is something about it that tastes so delicious with a cold glass of brew.  I do love their hot wings as well for as inexpensive as they are.    It's worth going in for at least one visit.  You may or may not like the service, depending on if they are understaffed.    On the other hand, if my review gets more people in...then they will start bringing in a 2nd server every time and no one will be able to complain about it anymore!!"}
{"text":"Good food pizza wings beer prices are ok happy hour is good I would come back and tell others"}
{"text":"Went back into Screwball with friends and its under new ownership.  Yeyyyyyy it is lively and fun again.  Good food good service. Cold beer.  So happy to have another little place to hang around."}
{"text":"I stop in hee to eat lunch, grab a sandwich or salad for lunch. I like it during this time because they aren't overly crowded and I know I can get in and out of here quickly and back to the office. Girls are friendly and I love the new look!!"}
{"text":"Me and my son was out to get a quick bit to eat... I tell you what. There was 1 waitress and seemed she had her children there ages around 7 or 9 years old....she gave us our drinks and went and played with her kids....really.....waited 25 minutes and we left....no classnever going back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Beer was ice cold, and there was a real funny nice guy behind the bar I think he said he was the new owner... anyways great food, cold beer and great staff. #Winning if you ask me!"}
