{"text":"I'm Vietnamese, so this place is the worst Ph√≥ I ever had. The broth was super sour and had no real taste. It was probably the same sensation as licking someone's athletes foot. I won't be coming back here anytime soon. Not recommended. Maybe for white people, yes."}
{"text":"Came with 2 other people at 8:40 on a Friday night. We were the only customers :( My friends used to come here a lot but under a different name. Kind of sad that it became so quiet.  We all got the house special, the meat was pretty bland. The soup, though, it feels like it's missing something, an ingredient or something. Or it might be really diluted. It doesn't taste bad, just not enough flavour. I wish I had the courage to tell them cause I think it should be an easy fix....but how do you tell people nicely that the food is not good enough?"}
{"text":"This place has been hear for a long time under various names. The current restaurant is not bad. The noodles are good and the fact that they give you a real hot pepper with your beansprouts is a nice touch. The only issue I have is with the broth. It's okay but inconsistent."}
{"text":"Pho Hong Ha used to be Pho Hoa which is a franchise Vietnamese restaurant.  Aside from the front door sign and the name, Pho Hong Ha is exactly like how it was use to be Hoa. Maybe it is in transition? or maybe that's no point being one of the franchise anymore?  I was lucky to order the large portion of Pho as it is kind of like a medium and good for a snack or light lunch. The broth is not bad, quite savoury. The noodle though is the dried type and so thin that it is more like a vermicelli...  The service though is lighting fast! From the moment I ordered to have it appeared on my table was like less than 2 minutes!"}
