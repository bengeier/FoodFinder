{"text":"Seated right away, got drinks fast, got our food pretty quick as well. It was well absolutely delicious. Best breakfast I've ever had! Lived in this town for 7 years and never stopped in before, will definitely be back and highly recommend!!"}

{"text":"Not a very good place for Sunday Brunch.  Went by today for Sunday Brunch and it turned out to be a disaster.  I wanted Breakfast items but because I walked in at 12:03, was told that breakfast ended at 12:00 and I was out of luck.  A momemt later, a young lady polked her head out the kitchen and announced that breakfast was closed.  OK, move on to plan B.  Order the Flounder Plate off of the regular menu.  Sorry, out of Flounder or for that matter, any Seafood. Forget the shrimp as well.  Move on to Bar- B-Que plate and guess what ... our of Bar-B-Que.  Finally determinded they had hamburger steak so ended up ordering that.  Came with French Fries, Texas Toast the a Side Salad.  Salad was very small and the greens were very wilted.  Hamburger steak was not very good and the fries were under cooked. The Texas Toast could have used a bit more time in the oven because it was obviously frozen and had not completely defrosted before in went into the over.  Not a good experience.  The atmosphere is more like an old Bonanza Steak House but I will admit, the service was very good.  Just not good enough to warrant coming back since I did not get what I wanted for lunch."}
{"text":"Place was packed so I thought that was a good sign. NOT! I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with squash casserole, buttered corn and cornbread. The breast had been fried at least twice and was burned and dripping of grease. The wing portion when I pulled it apart bleed onto my place. The can was straight up from a can with no seasoning whatsoever. The Sahara Desert has more moisture in it than the slab of cold cornbread that was thrown on my plate. BUT the squash casserole was edible so I will give them a star for that and the waitress never let my tea glass get empty. Don't think I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This building has seen a lot of restaurants come and go. It has a neat atmosphere if it were taken advantage of properly but the food needs to stand out too! I like to eat at places that are very creative with food or their food is so good you wonder what they do to make it better than you can at home. That being said, I can prepare the dishes on there menu just like and more than likely better! With the abundance of fresh produce and meats provided in the area I don't understand why they use so much frozen products! The hamburger is not fresh ground but rather bought in the 10# chubs and the vegetables are mostly all fried! The deserts are: well let's just say not homemade but mostly out of a can or store bought! The menu is a little to big and that just leads to quality issues. The daily special is the same each week and the price is roughly $10 for lunch not include tip! I'm not so much on price but the food needs to support it. Their shining star for food would definitely be the potato soup and that is a must have for me. It is very light and creamy with good bites of potatoes chives and bacon, it is always consistent. I guess if you're one to judge service quality then they deserve a praise but I'm after a good eat! This is southern cooking that anyone can do with little training required."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the only ok thing here. Tried lunch 3 times and it was not good at all. The waitress the last time was so sweet and apologized because the cooks had been messing up and cooking bad all day. She compensated our meal and done all she could to make up for the sub par food."}
{"text":"The staff here is VERY nice. The building has a lot of character. I really like the wood floors. I ordered a egg plate and my husband ordered an omelette plate. Once you eat down the street at Billy's you can tell a BIG difference. Billys barbecue in Mt Holly is better tasting breakfast, more food (you will a Togo box) bigger space with TVS and faster service (more waitress) And A lot cheaper!!! Will I be back Nope. Would I recommend to others, sure! Also why is there a computer/makeshift office in the dinning area?? I don't understand that. Why is there a $.40 fee for using a credit/debit card??? I've never been to a restaurant that does this."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people dislike this place so much. For what it was, it was a very pleasant experience. If you don't know, Stanley is quite literally the definition of a country town. Is one road-with a train that runs through it. So don't go into any place here expecting a 5 Star, city like experience. With that being said, i really enjoyed Friendly's. It had wonderful charm to it and was very inviting. The staff were all extremely kind and went out of the way to serve us.  The menu was very simple, a diner menu. I got a grilled cheese and French fries and it could not have hit the spot more. Fries were perfectly cooked with a nice crunch and the grilled cheese was the same and not greasy at all which is always a plus! The prices were amazing, we got two meals and a drink for 14$-can't go wrong there!  If I am ever in town again, I would definitely come back and try some more items from the menu"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, decent. For what this place is I think they do a great job. It's a inexpensive country diner with fast service.  My wife and I stopped here on our way back from picking up our Christmas tree on a Sunday morning. The service was extremely fast and the food was decent.  Was the food amazing? No, but my bill was $14 for both of us and that is amazing. I would definitely stop here again next time I'm in town"}
