{"text":"We have been ordering from this restaurant for two years and they were great so I don't want to give our experience below three stars. What prompted me to write this review is our most recent order.  We ordered a rotisserie chicken meal with two sides and drinks for ~40$ . Order came fast---but we received wilted lettuce salad (looked like two days old, stems browning, tomatoes saggy),  and an overly salted - smelly chickenm overly salted salad dressing. Food received did not indicate freshness, except for the potatoes - they were good.   Also, we were surprised that the rotisserie doesn't come with sauce anymore.The chicken did not have any sauce on it, in fact it was flavourless and smelly. It tasted similar to loblaws / superstore bought chicken.  This is is very unfortunate since we have been ordering from this place for years. We will have to find a new place with better food quality."}
{"text":"Food is extremely fresh and chicken is always tender and juicy. Its a hidden gem in the emry village and town of weston"}
{"text":"I ordered a 1/4 chicken dinner with potatoes  and salad instead of rice & they forgot the chicken.......didn't notice until I got home. So I basically paid $8.25 for potatoes and salad."}
{"text":"A family owned business that is a hidden gem. The staff was really nice and the food was excellent. I got the family pack and it came with a great quantity of side. The potatoes were soft and perfectly cooked and the chicken paired with the home made hot sauce was great!"}
{"text":"I ordered food off of Uber eats,  so I don't know how the place looks on the inside.  So I will just be scoring on food and service.   I ordered the half rotisserie chicken entree (comes with 3 sides and I chose rice,  potatoes and I am pretty sure I selected shrimp patties but got salad) and 2 pasteis de nata.   Service : I got a very pleasant phone call after my order.  Totally was unexpected, but  glad I did get a call. The woman who called asked if I would like hot sauce on chicken or on the side. I asked for both and both I received. The woman was very nice and helpful!   Food: I am Portuguese and have had my fair share of Portuguese chicken, I also am pretty critical when it comes to it.  The chicken was great,  very moist and had lots of flavor. The chicken had hot sauce on it,  and it came with the hot sauce I asked for on the side. The rice was pretty good and same goes with the potatoes. A ton of places can't cook the  potatoes right,  but they do them well here. Salad was good too. Only \"issue\" I have with the entree is that the salad wasn't separate from the other food. I know that packaging can be pricy,  but if the salad got soft or soggy that would have not been good. Now onto the pasteis de nata....  The custard was really good,  but the pastry was rather tough and made them unpleasant to eat.   Overall this is a great Portuguese chicken restaurant and  more people need to know about it. Will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
