{"text":"This place is great! I was drooling looking at all the healthy vegan and gluten free options. I ordered the tacos which were very tasty but ended up being less food than I wanted... I would advise to go with on of the other delicious options. Everything else we ordered looked and tasted great however. The young man who rang up our order was charming and friendly. This is a great find!"}
{"text":"I was not looking for a gluten free restaurant, but just something good for brunch. And this was perfect. The service was great and he food was amazing and so were the coffee options. A must try even if you are not looking for a gluten free meal."}
{"text":"There aren't many places I can eat that use the same high-quality ingredients I use in my own home: whole-grain gf flours, grass-fed meat and dairy, local honey, etc.  Cafe avalaun has high standards, and it shows in the flavors of their foods.  Don't complain about the prices, which aren't bad at all when you consider the costs of the raw ingredients.  You get what you pay for, and at this cafe you get real nourishment along with delicious and creative options."}
{"text":"I AM SO EXCITED THEY EXIST!
As some reviewers have noted, prices are higher than you might anticipate. However, you have to recognize the price of the ingredients they are using are much higher than a typical breakfast cafe. (coconut flour, for one, is not cheap!) Given that, I am quite impressed their prices are still reasonable.
I will start with the good and end with the not-so-good. So far I have gotten a crepe from here, as well as their \"Fast Sammy,\" which is an egg/cheese/meat (bacon I think?) combo on a buttermilk biscuit. Can I just say, I know this might not sound like a compliment, but the biscuit sandwich reminded me of my long-lost days ordering Shmiscuit from Scheetz, and eating this Fast Sammy made me oh-so-happy. (it is actually much higher quality - don't let my comparison scare you!)
I got the Grazing Goat crepe, and my dining partner got the S'mores crepe. The S'mores was VERY sweet; definitely a dessert more than a breakfast, but it was very good. The Grazing Goat was quite good, however I noticed whenever I got a piece of beet in my bite, as it stood out and didn't seem to meld with the other flavors.
The only real negative is that, based on the crepes we ordered, there didn't seem to be anything special about flavor combinations. I had in fact made GF/SF/etc crepes earlier that week for myself which I would venture to say were on par with what we experienced at Cafe Avalaun. However, I so appreciate how attentive they are to the GF population, and it sometimes is nice to have someone else make you a massive crepe and not have to worry about cleanup or anything. And that biscuit. Man. I have yet to replicate a solid GF biscuit, so if nothing else, those will keep me coming back.
I also enjoyed the overall ambience, and that they have windows to allow people to look into their kitchen (where I could see the tray full of buttermilk biscuits ready to go!).
Will enjoy revisiting whenever I am in the area. I wish it was closer to Akron!"}
{"text":"Finally, a healthy place that gets it right. I haven't had a bad meal here from the crepes to the desserts to the breakfast sandwiches and hot chocolate.  Friendly staff, healthy ingredients, and delicious food. Stop by and support this local gem. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Delightful! I had the frenchie fru fru crepe with pesto and Brie! 

Great balance of herbs and creamy Brie. 

The crepes are light and filling. 
I love that they support and use local farmers for their food. 

A must try for a breakfast and lunch. 
I will be back again!"}
{"text":"As someone who has Celiac's, my recent trip to Cafe Avalaun was more like a pilgrimage. A restaurant that is completely gluten free? Yes, I've been waiting to go here for what seems like forever. Now here are the things I wished I would have known before I went. First, this place is difficult to find. It's tucked away perpendicular to the street in a tiny strip in the middle of seemingly no where. We only found the place because our GPS told us we missed it, and could see it better driving in the opposite direction of the way we came. Second, this isn't a traditional restaurant, and admittedly the word Cafe in the name should have alerted me to this fact. If you have ever been to a traditional Dutch pancake place, you will know what to expect. After reviewing the chalk board menu of crepe options, you can head over to the cash register to order your Choice. Everything is ala carte. Beverage selections are limited to mostly coffee (no juice or many cold options) but if you want water, you can grab a Mason jar and fill it up at the little station at the back of the narrow seating section. Once you have made your purchase, you seat yourself and they will bring your food to you. There is a small section with bakery options if you want to order to go or as a treat after your meal. Lastly, the food. Crepes come in both sweet and savory brunch options and run about $10 a piece. Everything tasted good, but best of all, I don't have to wonder if I'm going to get sick at the end of my meal. I can eat whatever I want, completely worry free. I would, and have paid a lot of that kind of peace of mind. I just wish I knew what I was getting into when I walked in. I didn't even know about the water until the end of my meal. The service was a little...cool? They weren't unfriendly, but they weren't particularly helpful either, especially considering the Cafe wasn't busy at the time we were ordering. Even the food itself, was quite frankly, a little underwhelming. Maybe it was because I had built this place up in my mind, but it was decent, but nothing to convince me to go again. And I understand that this is a health conscious Cafe, but I would have killed for a packet of Splenda to put in my coffee (apparently I am that person). If you need to eat Gluten Free, give this place a try. The relief of knowing the food you eat won't make you sick is something you need to experience."}
{"text":"Wow what a gem. Great coffee, yummy crepes (both sweet and savory) and I can't wait to come back and try the amazing sounding salads and soups. Comfortable spot to linger and enjoy. Stumbled upon this place but no question we are coming back! Didn't even realize it was all gluten free until we were deep into reading the menu. UPDATE: delicious paleo bowl with shredded beef, greens, sauerkraut over a veg mash - enough to take some home for lunch tomorrow! Kale salad with pistachios and orange was good too. Have to come back to try the apple pumpkin soup!"}
{"text":"We had a breakfast crepe and coffee here this AM. Upon suggestion from the man at the counter, my husband I shared the \"Hash It Out\" crepe (sweet potato mash, bacon, and maple syrup crepe topped with a fried egg). Delicious!! Nice coffee selections as well, also espresso. Very cute little cafe in a a small strip mall that inside  reminded me of a cool place one might find in a college town, but in Warrensville Heights! The man behind the counter was super friendly and clearly proud to be a part of the place (maybe even the owner?). We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a GF dream come true!  What's even better than a 100% GF menu is the fact that everything is mouthwatering delicious. The crepes are really good, but the panini's are amazing.  I've had both the turkey club and the vegan roasted veggie. Beyond perfection! The baked goods are also divine. They use grass-fed butter and make every item on the menu from scratch. Even my non-GF friends love this place. The staff is super friendly and helpful to navigate any other allergies, offering dairy free, soy free and nut free options as well. Thank you Cafe Avalaun for bringing such a delicious need to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Some of the best baked goods and crepes I've ever had -- gluten-free or otherwise. You'll want to get one of everything. It's that good. 

Highly recommended for all, but an absolute must-visit for people with celiac and gluten-sensitivity. The place is truly 100% gluten-free -- you won't find anything like it in Cleveland at this time. 

A new Cleveland gem, and a godsend for those with food allergies."}
{"text":"You must order ahead for pickup (you'll still have to wait when you get there) if you have any time restrictions or anywhere else to be. This place moves at a TURTLE PACE, taking their sweet old time as if the customers' have nowhere else to be. 

If you don't call ahead and order at the counter, you've got a half hour wait just for one crepe. Completely ridiculous. I was almost tempted to go behind the counter and make my own. And while I was at it back there, make all the other disgruntled customers' crepes as well. 

It should be called \"Restaurant Avalaun\" because the word cafe, to me at least, means that it can be a quick in and out. This is far from quick. 

Disclaimer: I'm leaving this review without tasting the food."}
{"text":"We took our friends who were visiting from Europe to Cafe Avalaun and we were so pleased. The best latte I have had in a very long time. The menu offers a different breakfast option that is fresh. The service was great too. We plan to visit again!"}
{"text":"Great place to go be a pompous ass. Speaking of which,  there was a minimum of one in my face for the duration of my visit.  The place is ridiculously overcrowded.  How the fire department has not shut it down is beyond me. Service sucked and crepe was undercooked.  Do yourself a favor and stay away!"}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Avalaun today for the first time and ordered the Turkey Club Panini on a recommendation from the staff. I REALLY wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, my panini was one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had, especially for the $14 (including tip) that it cost. The bread was warm but all of the insides were cold. Not just room temperature but actually cold. Something about eating cold, slimy bacon just really rubbed me the wrong way. The turkey was also not shredded as they describe on the menu. It looked like the turkey was cut into large chunks and then cooked (vs. cooking entire turkey breast and then shredding). The 4 round chunks of turkey were not good on this panini. 
When I took my plate up to the counter with only two bites missing from my sandwich, the staff did not even ask if everything was alright. I wish the whole experience would have been better but I will not be visiting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was great. My wife has a gluten and dairy allergy and this place was friendly and accommodating. The whole place is gluten free. Most importantly the two paninis and chocolate cookies we had were delicious. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and it is gluten free.  My sister and I love to go there.  Our favorite is the lemon crape. I get mine with the blue berries and extra lemon, she only gets the extra lemon.

One of the reviewers below said their crapes weren't fresh.  All I can say is they make them right there where you can them pour the batter on the crape maker.

One of my other favorites is their Mexican Jumping Bean it is their wonderful creamy spicy hot chocolate with a shot of espresso.  I haven't had a spicy hot chocolate like that since I lived in San Francisco.  Most places add some cinnamon and think they are done. They are so wrong.  You've gotta bring on the heat."}
{"text":"This place is EVERYTHING positive the reviews claim it to be. No seriously, I mean it. Gluten sensitive or not, this place is legit....delicious! 

My 69 year old mom was recently diagnosed with Celiacs. We are FOODIES so after several months of mourning, we are born again, and seeking the best, most delicious, GF options the restaurant world has to offer. With that being said, we have been as devastated UNTIL coming here. Great food, excellent service, total WIN! Do yourself a favor, give them a try! Thank me after."}
{"text":"The best place for crepes or breakfast in general. Everything is absolutely awesome and the girls that work here pay attention to every detail!"}
{"text":"The good news = Food is delicious... Fantastic crepes.
The bad news= very poor service, breakfasts came out 15 min apart.

Prolly best to avoid on Sunday's.

Nice people."}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten free cake for our anniversary and it was wonderful. They were very easy to work with and were basically willing to make whatever I wanted."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Opened up close to my work (within walking distance) and even offered discounts for local business employees! The food is amazing, I can't believe it's all Gluten Free! I don't have issues myself, but coworkers, friends, and family all have. It's great to be able to go somewhere with them and not worry if there will be anything they can eat, or if there's any contamination to worry about. Their options are great too! Who knew a cheese-steak crepe would be one of my new favorite things. I highly recommend it to any and everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a warm cozy environment.

The chef owner is very hands on and creates unique experiences to suit your needs and diet. Whether you are looking for a unique meeting environment, a healthy meal for your family or yummy pastery, this place doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place up for quite some time and finally decided to give it a try. It's so cute and super artisan hipster in terms of vibe - wood tables and chalk writing for the menu. 
The best part is that it's all gluten free and the Menu also has denotations that indicate \" nut free \" or \"vegan\" and such- that's the bomb in my opinion.
They specialize in crepes and I ordered the croque Madame and S'mores- both were so good. I had the braised beef paleo bowl and it was amazing. My friend had an omelet and while she liked it, it was sort of mediocre. The prices are on par with other menus of the same caliber- 13 for my bowl and the crepes were 11 each. They have great coffee and the service is super friendly and efficient.
Overall, it's a really cute place and one to check out for a brekkie or lunch break."}
{"text":"Finally!  An independent cafe in the eastern suburbs!

Great place for breakfast and lunch...  Coffee bar format.  Their specialty is CREPES and gluten free. Breakfast, sweet and savory dishes.  Also they have a mouth watering display case full of bakery goodies all made on site.  

Try the Monkey-Bee-Nuts:  bananas, sunflower seed butter, and honey drizzle in a steaming hot crepe.

This is the kind of cool vibe place you would expect to find in Ohio City --- Get yourself to the intersection of Emery and Richmond, head south and its on your left.... Go there now!"}
{"text":"Cafe Avalaun is a fantastic establishment with excellent food and great customer service, but there is a reason for my three stars.  If you're like me, atmosphere is probably important to you.  Cafe Avalaun is cute and has a fun menu, but it's a little overwhelming to read it, drawn on the wall as it is.  Worse than that, the space is tiny.  For the first ten minutes of my visit, I was pushed into my table.  I had to get up and ask three tables to scoot down a bit, because there was room for all of us, but things had shifted.  It is not the fault of the cafe that the space is limited, though built in booths would solve the problem of cramped tables.  However, until that problem is fixed, you may won't going on a day when it is not crowded.  I ate here on a Sunday and the wait was slightly longer because the cafe was full.  The food was so good I would not hesitate to return...and if you have dietary needs, you're gonna l love this place. But if crowds bother you, pick a slow day, because this place crowds easily.

Five stars for everything but the space."}
{"text":"Nice cozy breakfast place.

We got the No-tella (sweet) and Scrapple Dapple (breakfast) crepes.

No-tella was a typical Nutella with bananas and berries crepe. Yummy as usual.

Scrapple Dapple was more unique and yummy. It had some fried \"scrapple\", eggs, and apple in them. Still not sure what scrapple is but it sure was tasty.

We also had the Citron Jasmine Tea in a pot to share for 3. They had a big tub of honey on the counter you could use if you like that in your tea. It was a light flavored tea with a hint of citrus. Yummy."}
{"text":"I applaud what they are doing food-wise and theme-wise here.  I love that they have Paleo offerings, too.  But my Croque Madame crepe had no seasoning whatsoever in it so the eggs were bland.  The little one got the banana and not Nutella crepe and said it was good.  The hubs got a cinnamon roll, took one bite and said it wasn't good.  All in, the prices are over-reaching a bit when the food quality isn't consistently good, thus the 3-star rating.  I hope they can fine tune the food to make it great because we need more places like this one!"}
{"text":"Slow service, and an idiotic layout that leaves one seated practically on top of the other patrons. My dish was sitting on the counter for about fifteen minutes. I had to go ask the server if it was my meal before she realized that indeed it was."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Walked in, saw it was busy and had a great atmosphere. Not exactly sure what happened but food took just about 45 min to be prepared. Waited 20mins alone for the water jug to be refilled and to get my latte. The food was average to us. Frenchie fru fru tasted bland to me. Food is pricy, which I didn't mind paying since the ingredients are high quality but You have to retrieve your own food, clear your own table. As my husband stated, \"the price you pay for the food and experience was not worthy.\" Left disappointed in the end."}
{"text":"My gluten free Ohio adventures continue.  I found this place online and to be honest their website is wayyyy more generic than the actual cafe.  
So first off, there is tons of parking and the cafe is on a corner and readily visible from the road (aka yay for me finding it without really trying).  Upon entering it has a bit of a rustic/hip feel.  There are chalkboards on the wall with the menu written on them in very nice handwriting and their display case is filled with gluten free pastries immediately visible on entry.  The staff are super nice and helpful.  
After about 3 seconds of indecision i chose the 'not'ella crepe with strawberries AND bananas, a caramel frappe and to round out my gluten free collection of course I HAD to purchase their travel mug.  My caramel frappe came first and it was deliciously sweet and silky.  It was the perfect drink for a very hot day.   Anyway, while sipping on the frappe I was treated to a show.  That is to say that the crepe station is readily visible and I got to see my crepe crafted :D   
The crepe was soft with a bit of a crisp, overall it tasted like a crepe.  So yes the flavor might not be a new experience; however, it was nice to experience crepes out and about.  Overall, it is the kind of place that makes you want to stay longer just for the atmosphere.  It really is nice to visit a completely gluten free facility and I would definitely come back.  Until then I will enjoy my wonderful travel mug to remind me of the experience."}
{"text":"It's a nice concept, the crepe I had (fru fru frenchie) was mediocre at best. Although my husband loved his roasted vegetable panini and coffee. A little pricey for a cafe in Solon. The place was cute with all the rustic country theme."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday to kill an hour in between meetings while in town on business.  I had a turkey panini on quinoa bread, an almond milk latte & a cookie.  Everything was tasty and fresh and the staff was super nice and personable.  Free wifi, clean bathrooms and great ambiance.  I'll definitely come back if I need to kill time before seeing clients in the area again.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's a pleasure and appreciated to have a gluten free restaurant!
This is my second visit.
The food is good.
It's not fabulous!
My first visit I had a paleo Deja Vu bowl. It was lacking any real exciting layers even though it was braised beef, whipped white veggies, greens. Lots of room for improvements in taste and servings. The size for $12.00 was an estimated 4 ounces of food. 
Today we had Philly crepe and Notella and beet and greens salad.
Decent just not exciting. 
No stomach ache though!
We will be back."}
{"text":"Checked this place because hello, crepes, and because of all the amazing reviews. I have to recommend you do the same! The crepes steal the show with fancy options like the Grazing Goat that I got (honey goat cheese, fresh blueberries, beets, walnuts, and spinach with a balsamic vinaigrette) or the homey Clevelander that eats like the best perogie I've ever had, which my friend ordered and I was lucky enough to taste. Interestingly done house made pommes frites or jalapeño poppers top the ever-changing seasonal apps menu, and you can also get vegan bowls piled high with grilled veggies, or grilled sandwiches, special teas and coffees, and any of your crepes made like a breakfast burrito if you prefer. You make your very hard order/decision at a traditional cafe counter and watch the crepes made in front of you. Little touches like the cook adding extra blueberries to your order or them making the ice tea fresh because what they had in the fridge was from yesterday make this plate just as cute and cozy as can be. Check out the photos, check out the reviews, but above all else--check out the gooooooood food. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I found Cafe Avalaun through a Facebook Event. I was in the area and took my mom there because she has celiacs and eating out is difficult for her. What an amazing find!  We were greeted warmly. The clerk walked us through the menu after learning it was our first time there. Our lunch was fresh and delicious!  The staff was friendly and accommodating. We will be going back as much as possible!  Would love for them to open a west side location!"}
{"text":"We come here for quick work meetings. 
Wish they had a location in University Circle.
Great service, great coffee, great food (everything is gluten free too which is nice).

LET ME KNOW WHEN U MAKE MORE BROWNIES BC THAT WAS STRAIGHT CRACK"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is fantastic. I had their \"grazing goat\" crepe and it was fantastic--like a fresh salad in a crepe. The crepes are made to order and they're incredible light and soft. The goat cheese wasn't too overpowering and the caramelized walnuts added a nice crunchy texture to the otherwise soft crepe. I also had a cup of their drip coffee and it tasted wonderful. 

The service is great too, everyone is so friendly, love the atmosphere., it's super chill and kinda hip. They serve water in mason jars!

 I definitely want to go back at some point to try one of their breakfast foods...maybe splurge and get the keto coffee."}
{"text":"Service was great. The Mexican hot chocolate is delicious. Unfortunately my omelet was burnt which was a little disappointing... I wouldn't mind trying it out again. Love the concept of the restaurant, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Who ever knew that such a small delightful place would sit in a near empty shopping center, overlooking a vacant Country Kitchen that has stood empty for 20 years? In an age where corporate food franchises seem to be on every corner, seeing a locally owned cafe with delicious food, creative dishes, and healthy options is like the sun beaming down from an overcast sky! 

The menu leans heavily on breakfast items, wirh various choices of crepes and omlettes, as well as panninis and baked goods, such as muffins. While crepes are a tempting choice on any day, I opted for the vegetable pannini and Mexican hot chocolate. The pannini was excellent and came with grilled portabella mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and several other items - simply fantastic! 

The hot chocolate was made using a high quality, dark chocolate powder and had a slight touch of cinnamon and cayenne pepper... wow! Some places you find on purpose, others you stumble upon, like I did. If you're in the vicinity of Emery and Richmond, I highly recommend you try this place, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This is honestly my favorite place to have lunch in Cleveland. I stop in whenever I am in the area and get one of the crepes and a beverage. Everything has been amazing and the staff is so wonderful. I believe it might be the owner, but she always recognizes me by my glasses. :) it's one of those small details that always makes me feel welcome. My favorite is the Oh Canada, but I also like the Frenchy Frou Frou a lot. I've never had anything I didn't like from here. The fact that it is dedicated gluten free is amazing. It honestly reminds me of some of the places I like out west in Oregon. I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!!!  
I can't say enough about this place! The MOST INCREDIBLE CREPES!!  My try the Clevelander Crepe!! The banana bread! 
Cafe Avalaun is 100% gluten free!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry that my daughter and I have to be contrarians to most of the reviews.  My long standing vegan daughter and I, a crepe fancier, were both excited to try the Avalaun for lunch.  I ordered the Za and Annie had the vegan bowl with rice.  Both dishes were lukewarm and tasteless.
\The crepe was rubbery, but I don't know if that has to do with it being gluten free.   The coffee was also lukewarm, which is inexcusable since Panera uses the same type dispenser and their beverages are always hot.  Since we arrived later in the day  - 1:45 - they probably did not want to make a fresh pot.  I prepaid a 15% gratuity upon ordering, for service that was no better than at Chipotle.  No one ever bothered to stop by to inquire if we enjoyed our meal.  
Obviously, we did not."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my mom and grandmother we all had crapes I had mine with strawberries, banana and maple syrup, and a vegetable omelette services great staff is very friendly Love you healthy options food taste fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"This place is great! I have been gluten free for almost 4 years and I wish I would have found this place sooner! I had the not-ella crepe, and it was great! I am usually hesitant to try new GF-labeled things (it usually results in me throwing the $$ directly in the trash), but I was MORE THAN IMPRESSED with the fluffy, non-grainy-tasting crepe. The not-ella and the fresh banana were wonderful, too. The sugar cookies are my favorite from the bakery, and I can't wait to try more things. Next visit, I'll be getting the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"What a nice restaurant to eat there. as well as the atmosphere is very friendly.
The service is very good, very polite and respectful employees"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast . Crepes are more like pancakes and extremely sweet . Coffee was good . Cute environment but was not impressed with quality of the food for the high prices. Overall disappointed."}
{"text":"The concept is great and the food is 4-4.5 star quality. But, it takes a while to get your food and it is narrow and seating is limited. The vegan chocolate donuts that we had were amazing! Don't come too hungry, that way when the food is ready, you will be :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for a Sunday breakfast. Don't come if you're in a hurry. Not a fast place. The ambiance is cozy. Got crepes and a yoghurt parfait. The crepes were ok, your average crepe. Yoghurt parfait was very small for the price. Overall pricey for what is being served/service."}
{"text":"This place is small and cozy, but definitely full of potential! Doesn't taste gluten free at all! Had  crepes! (sweet and savory) Will definitely be coming back!!
I went back recently and they had a gluten/free dairy free brownie that was really good but very sugary!"}
{"text":"Came here today with a friend for lunch and loved it! My friend and I are both gluten free (I'm a newbie) and we found the taste of the food and freshness to be phenomenal!! I got the Nutella crepe with banana and it was so delicious! The place is rather small, but was a great cozy spot to sit with a friend and enjoy the afternoon."}
{"text":"The east side needs a small French Cafe and Creperie, like I need oxygen, and viola, this place opens up. It's been around since Nov. 2015 and I barely noticed. When I moved east, I missed Le Petit Triangle Cafe. This place matches Le Petit, with such a flair for authenticity and creativity. Inside it looks and feels like a slice of Paris.

Check out the menu with their delicious and creative crepes in three varieties: breakfast, sweet and savory. They are open until dinner and have a dinner menu as well. The latte I had was superb, kind of like the ones you can have at Rising Stars Roasters.

The place is run by a real chef with real creativity. I knew it from the use of mason jars as water glasses, which is a true indicator of great eats IMO."}
{"text":"I took my daughter to this cafe this morning as a treat. We were excited to discover this cafe through a mutual friend who also has dietary restrictions. Chef Brian offers a variety of menu items that are paleo, vegetarian, and vegan friendly. All menu items are soy and gluten free, and the chef works with you to make your dish dairy free (i.e., substituting coconut milk for cow milk; Daiya cheeses, etc.).

Ever since we were diagnosed with dairy and gluten issues, eating out usually means a lot of frustration. Not here!

Many local vendors are supported, from the photography on the walls, to the wonderful organic herbal teas. The decor is rustic merged with industrial chic. It's very casual and laid back. Service is very friendly, and we both enjoyed our meals. 

If you want someone to prepare your meals, Avalaun now offers Friday Night Popup Dinners! More details are on their website.

We are definitely going to support this wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but it was the worst experience with crepes in my life. I know how to cook them, and I was so disappointed after I had tried a couple of them there. They were uncooked and not tasty at all."}
{"text":"Good crepes, good atmosphere! Heads up, the chai tea is very meh. I probably wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"A nice, cozy little place. Totally gluten free for those of you needing it or living that lifestyle. They also offer some dairy free, soy free, and/or peanut free options. It's a nice little find in this area.

I got the Clevelander crêpe and it was fan-damn-tastic! Cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and mashed potatoes wrapped up in a light crêpe with crème fraiche on the side. Almost like a massive pierogi. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!  Tight quarters and takes a little time, but well worth the wait.  All gluten free, but tastes delicious.  Great coffee too."}
{"text":"OMG - this place is soon good!

We stopped by on our way back to MI.  I wish we lived in Cleveland so that we could routinely partake of this deliciousness.  I had a roasted veggie crepe with pesto (not a menu item).  My hubby had the \"hash it out\" crepe and that was divine.  It was fun to go to a place that was 100% gluten free.  He is not GF, but he couldn't even tell.  I bought a cupcake and cookie for the road. They also have almond breeze, so I had a wonderful chai latte.  The only thing we would have passed on was the kombucha drink.  I guess that is just too healthy for our tastebuds. 

I also bought some Cleveland Kraut to bring a little bit of our hometown back to MI."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED for diners with allergens!

This place is amazing!! I stopped in with my mom recently. Everything here is 100% gluten free. They also have MANY other foods for anyone with dietary restrictions. The owner/operator was really nice. The only reason I took one star off was because the food was mostly reasonably priced for how healthy it was made but the coffee (and other beverages) was outrageously priced. $9 for a bulletproof (keto) coffee, $2.50 for regular old coffee. 

I got a loaf of Gluten Free Italian bread - 3lb loaf was $14 but THAT was worth it!!! Best I have had, ever."}
{"text":"We ordered the Giddy Up crepe and Hash it Out crepe. Both were excellent! We also ordered the chai tea latte and their signature Mexican Jumping Bean (a shot of espresso in Mexican Drinking Chocolate). Both were delicious, though they could've been a little hotter. We also waited about 10-15 minutes to get our drinks, and then another 10 for food. But there was a family of 6 ahead of us, so it's understandable. It is certainly more expensive than the average cafe, but the quality of their ingredients is far above average. We wanted to try so many more things on the menu, so will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Never write reviews but the food was delicious. It looks like a cafe you would see in Tremont or Ohio City as was said in another review. We will be back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for so long!!!!  And I had no idea how close it was to my job.  So one day after water aerobics I decided to try them out.  And let me tell you!!!!  It was the best decision.

They have vegan and gluten free options that are quite yummy!!!!  That day I decided to treat myself and try their vegan carrot cake cupcake!!!  Oh my goodness!  You must try this!  It was so delicious.  I am dreaming about it currently. The meal that I had was very savory and flavorful.  I forgot the name of it but it was the vegan bowl made with cauliflower rice.

They even have a meal plan service that folks could use.  Since I know how close it is to my job, I will be back for all my lunch needs!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. I come here every week and absolutely adore their food. Becoming gluten free was challenging but this gem allows me to get a taste of all the things I miss. Their yellow cake donuts with chocolate ganache are to die for. I'm fact, anything with their chocolate ganache is amazing. The only downside to Cafe Avalaun is the slowness of service. Don't plan on coming for a quick bite- give yourself at least 35 minutes , even for take out. It's worth the wait but sometime taunting as you see others around you enjoying their meals in what seems like half the time."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5. Great place for something different. Really good crepes and good quality in presentation and taste.. The coffee is a little light, but if you dine there, you can help yourself.  The lemon curd and walnut is so fabulous, I'm still thinking about it. I also ordered the frufru savory crepe which was excellent. My friend ordered the Notella and there wasn't much fruit in it, but a lot of the chocolate, not an ideal balance. I wish they would make a deal to do 2 crepes for 16$. As good as they are, an individual bill of 25$ for 2 crepes and a coffee  isn't something I'll do regularly. if they were open at night, I would get just a sweet crepe for dessert,  but since I'm going for brunch on the weekend, I gotta have both!! Can't think of many Clevelanders who would just order one crepe...  Regardless, everyone should try this place once."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for the Valentine's Day Pre Fixe menu and all I can say is O!  M!!  G!!!!!!!  Chef Brian and his staff OUTDID themselves with this menu.   I was so torn about what to order... cuz it all looked so amazing.   I started with the French Onion Soup.   I decided on this when I heard a neighboring patron say it was the best French Onion Soup he had ever had in his life.   Let's just say I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!  IT WAS AMAZING!  Then I had the Ribbons salad, which I enjoyed very much.   My main course was the Gnocchi.  It truly melted in my mouth.   My gluten eating husband loved everything as well (ps he had the roast chicken and whipped potatoes.   It came with Brussels Sprouts which he doesn't like, so I got to feast on those too.  They were as good as candy!  We ended with a plate with 4 different desserts. One was better than the next.   I don't usually eat dessert, but it was worth every.  single.  bite...  We WILL be back.  I know I already said it, but Brian, you truly outdid yourself."}
{"text":"This place is truly deserving of a 5-star rating. Upon walking in, you get that French café vibe. Small, few tables, coffee in the air, and a menu that is simple but significant. They catered to gluten-free, vegan, ketogenic, vegetarian, and carnivorous dietary needs. I am not a big crepe fan, but I decided to give it a whirl and ordered the Frenchie fru fru. It consisted of roasted chicken, house-made pesto, mushrooms, fresh spinach and brie. Perfect distribution and amount of ingredients within the delicious, crispy pocket of heaven! 

Was it a little expensive? Sure. Was it worth every penny? Absolutely. This place concerns itself with high-quality ingredients that patrons are consuming and frankly, you get what you pay for. 

Although it did not include table service, the workers were kind and concerned with our experience. The music was hip and soft but still something you could ignore if having a conversation or reading. The coffee was fantastic (fair trade) and I even ended up buying the last half pound of Peruvian in the place. 

If you do find yourself at this hidden gem and are debating whether the chocolate chip cookie is worth that extra mile on the treadmill, let me tell you right now, it is! 

Delicious everything."}
{"text":"What a truly excellent find!  This cafe boasts a completely gluten-free menu and also caters easily to other food sensitivities (dairy, soy, nut, paleo, etc). The food is very tasty, the flavors combine wonderfully in their crepes and sandwiches. They have a tasty Mexican hot cocoa, too. The cookies are kid-approved!"}
{"text":"ALL THE STARS! I love when my Yelp app helps me find new places. I discovered this lovely café after a visit to nearby Ahuja Medical Center.

This place oozes originality and familial warmth. I loved reading the story in their entryway about being a family owned business named after their mother, Avalaun. The café is 100% gluten-free, born out of their need to address medical issues of their son. 

In the most inconspicuous location of a strip mall, Café Avalaun is really something special. The ambience is warm and cozy. I love the chalkboard menus, stencil wall quotes and dried flowers on tables. They also have the most beautiful eclectic art stemming from photos of their mother, with her at the center of a tree of life made of forks and spoons. 

Everything in this café is open concept, ranging from the seating to the ordering counter. As its café style, they'll bring your food to you, but you won't have a server. My Mom and I split two crepes (Croque Madame and the Nutella Banana), and it made for a lovely breakfast. When in doubt with crepes, choose a sweet AND savory. They also have a fancy coffee selection and fantastic loose leaf tea options. 

The staff was incredibly thoughtful and cared about our experience. I loved supporting this beautiful little café...especially when they make you feel part of the family!"}
{"text":"Went on lunch today. Absolutely amazing. So nice to get something made fresh and to order. The Lemon Bar on buckwheat crepe is a MUST! Roasted veggie panini was really good too. Already looking forward to next visit."}
{"text":"Finally gluten free that tastes like gluten! They have a great selection of crepes, build your own omelettes, specialty coffee drinks, and food specials. 

The crepes we got (s'mores and not-ella) didn't look filling at first it once you dig in they're the perfect amount. And they taste good! Gluten free is usually hit or miss but I will definitely be back even though I'm not GF at all. They source from lots of Cleveland locals which is an automatic plus for me. Can't wait to go back and try the sweet potato hash! Can't go wrong with the bakery items either. 

Definitely don't knock this GF place until you try it out!"}
{"text":"I'm frequently around Warrensville Heights so I decided to give Avalun a try. I didn't know it was a gluten free bakery and I had never been in a gluten free establishment. I had a savory crepe ( the Frenchie Fru Fru) which obviously tasted a bit different then a regular crepe but not too much that it seemed obviously GF like some of the things you pick up in the supermarket. I wasn't a huge fan of my crêpe but then again, I'm not used to GF food. I did however love my coffee! They serve real macchiato not the Starbucks's kind. 
Perks: free wifi, easy parking, wide selection and nice place to study"}
{"text":"Great GF spot, though the food is really great even if it wasn't gluten free! Definitely the best spot in Cleveland for Gluten Free'ers, or crepe enthusiasts.

Everything is just well done period: Crepes are inventive and well executed, I've had almost every one on the menu and I'd order any one of them again. A great added bonus is that they use Snowville milk for coffee creations and other, I personally like the Mexican drinking chocolate.

Great place with great people at the helm, it's friendly and inviting. Three thumbs way up! That's right I borrowed someone else thumb!"}
{"text":"The best cup of coffee ever...pumpkin latte!  Ventured forth and had the Cafe Avalaun Crepe!
It was delicious!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The coffee was great but the omelette soggy... 
Service was excellent... The coffee and the service will make me go back and try another item on the food menu. I just wish they had a better location than a small strip mall."}
{"text":"I finally made the trek to the east side to try this gluten free cafe. All I can say is, I guess it's good they don't have a location on the west side, because I would go completely broke coming here.

Having gone gf, all I've wanted is a decent biscuit so I can have a quality breakfast sandwich. It happened! Their biscuits taste amazing. I would never know they are gluten free. I wanted to try a crepe too, but I couldn't eat both. I ordered a scrambled egg and cheese biscuit, Home fries, lavender lemonade, and a vanilla cupcake, all made from scratch. I even saw the staff make my individual serving of potatoes. 

Atmosphere: cute and small. It's definitely a cafe, you could not bring large parties here to eat, but it's perfect for a solo meal or you and a friend. The walls are a nice muted lavender color, and the tables are a dark wood. You can see the kitchen from most spots, and there is a serve yourself water dispenser set up.

Service: everyone I talked to was very sweet. It appears that the staff do everything, from taking orders, to cooking and cleaning. They were all working hard the entire time I was here.

Overall I can wait to come back. I really want to try a crepe, and a veggie bowl with cauliflower rice. Of course I'll get more biscuits as well. I'll actually eat all the biscuits. So don't order any. They're mine."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Great dedicated gluten free facility!! Will definitely return!! I had a Paleo Bowl with braised beef that was just mouth watering!! I love that they have other allergen options, as well. I can't have any dairy, and that was not a problem. They had dairy-free cheeses and almond milk available. This made me a VERY happy camper!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out Cafe Avalaun because of my dietary restriction where I have to avoid milk. This restaurant offers dairy free, gluten free, meatless free options for all those experiencing strict diet restrictions. 

I ordered one of their paninis which are made on gluten free bread and I also got a coffee. Now, for someone who has a very severe allergy, I'm sure this is great, however I think it is very over priced for what you are getting. It does taste alright but it needed salt, like everywhere. The coffee was okay but again, exteremely over priced. Now my sister-in-law who has lupus and cannot have gluten, lives for this cafe, so i think it depends on what you are looking for. As I have said though, get ready to spend some money because this place does not come cheap."}
{"text":"Layout, cleanliness, food quality, and service are all great. I was always ok paying a little extra for food due to the above and always knew across the board prices were slightly inflated due to no competition in the area. Today I was charged $7.50 for a 2 shot 12oz vanilla latte, that price doesn't even exist in Manhattan - let alone Warrensville Hts,OH. It's beyond obnoxious to be told that a 12, 16, or 20 oz latte comes with a single shot of espresso and that an extra shot was additional $1.50+. Double shot latte should be standard and if not that sure as all not $7.50."}
{"text":"My boss had my coworkers & I meet her here for a breakfast meeting. The girl at the counter was the absolute sweetest & just genuinely nice. She helped me figure out what kind of coffee to get & didn't seem annoyed that I wasn't sure what I wanted. 

I wasn't expecting the food to be so good! I got the Oh Canada crepe & it's changed my dislike of crepes. It was huge & packed full of eggs, cheese, potatoes & sausage. You definitely get your moneys worth.

 I liked how cozy it was inside & the giant, handwritten menu behind the counter. I would MUCH rather hang out here with my coffee & a book than at Starbucks! I know I'll be stopping here before work from now on."}
{"text":"Uhm, so wow!  Love this place!  Everything I've tried is so good!  Eric who makes good and drinks is super friendly!  Eating here makes me feel better about myself lol  If you don't like cookies that taste like pure sugar then don't get a cookie, I will say that... but I love them so I'm not complaining, just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Wow blown away. Never knew this place existed. I'm very pleased with my order. I ordered an omlet (spinach, cheddar and bacon) with a side homemade biscuit and some berry compost. Omg soooo yummy  i hope i have enough food left to take a picture lol. Definitely will be back. Customer service was awesome. Lots of smiling faces."}
{"text":"Cafe Avalaun is a solid breakfast/brunch/weekday lunch spot in the Beachwood area. Totally gluten free if that's important to you, but even if it isn't - this is a very solid place to grab a bite. 

The first time I went there I was BLOWN AWAY by how good the Oh Canada crepe was - sausage, eggs, potatoes, cheese, maple syrup. Delicious! 

A couple of months later, I brought a couple friends back for lunch and I ordered the same thing. While still pretty good, the Oh Canada wasn't consistent with what I'd experienced the first time - the sausage inside was completely different and overall just wasn't as flavorful. 

The service is friendly but can get pretty slow when they are busy so either call ahead for takeout or plan to wait a bit at busy times. 

I will head back as I work in the area sometimes and hopefully if they sort out the some of the inconsistencies, I can bump this up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you have dietary restrictions, Café Avalaun is the place to go! No more sacrificing taste! These crepes were so good, you couldn't even tell they were gluten free!

Once you walk into the café there's a large window that you can use to look in the kitchen and see what's really going on behind the scenes. The entire place had a very earthy / hipster vibe, which I loved. 

I tried the s'mores crepe and a bite of the Nutella crepe. If you're in the mood for a sweet breakfast, this is the place for you. They do offer more hearty crepes that had ingredients like eggs and cheese, and those looked delicious as well. 


I will definitely be back to Café Avalaun next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"If you are celiac, gluten sensitive, or not you can't get better than Cafe Avalaun.  It is completely GLUTEN FREE and they have options for everyone!!!! Egg free, nut free, dairy free, paleo, they leave no one behind.  
If you need certain items it is best to call ahead and order.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go to Cafe Avalaun for a while now and was super excited to finally get a chance to try their crepes! The indoor space and decor was really cute, but I was a little disappointed. The space was smaller than it seemed like through other yelp reviews, and the crepes didn't quite live up to the hype. Everything had either bacon, sausage, or some sort of pork in it, so if that's something you can't eat, this is definitely not the place for you. I did ask them to take out pork in my breakfast crepe, but that left it with scrambled eggs and fried apples, which tasted too sour and bland at the same time. 

I did not get a chance to try other menu items or any of their coffee, but I left the place feeling dissatisfied. Everything seemed overpriced for what you're getting. 

Besides the pork-in-everything and slightly overpriced menu, though, the space was really cute and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Avalaun for the first time for brunch today with a friend.  I ordered a dairy free crepe with bananas, walnuts and honey.  After taking 1 or 2 bites I noticed a hair on my plate and asked for a new order. The second one they brought was raw and I sent it back and the raw batter left a bad taste in my mouth.  The cook said she could remake it but the coconut batter does not cook well and it would taste the same.  I was so disappointed that no manager or owner even came to apologize.  Also I ordered an omelet to go to bring to my husband and it was made incorrectly and I had to wait awhile for a replacement.  Far too many mistakes in one visit.  Most likely will not return!"}
{"text":"Cafe Avalaun knows what they're doing. Their crêpes are delicious and the coffee has always hit the spot. 

I'm usually a picky crêpe eater because I've lived in France, but the ones at Cafe Avalaun have the perfect consistency. I had a crepe with honey, nuts and sunflower seeds and it totally hit the spot. I can't remember the name verbatim but I do think it was a monkey-something. 

The interior is small but comfortable. The tables are big enough if you want to bring your stuff and get some work done. The staff has always been friendly and helpful when I couldn't make up my mind."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant ever and the first completely gluten free restaurant in Ohio. 
Fabulous food, scrumptious baked goods, delicious special dinner nights occasionally. 
Fantastic breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Just got home from this lovely little cafe! A few Fridays a month they have a special menu on fridays night and is open til 9pm! This Friday was Italian night! Everything was gluten free!!! I mean EVERYTHING! They also have a bunch of stuff that is labeled for dairy free, soy free, nut free .. etc... 
  Our table got the fried calamari with marinara sauce to start. It was pretty darn tasty! A tad bit chewy... but we aren't in Miami here .. it was still very good! The bread in was the bomb..  
  My husband got the chicken parm... omg soooo good! Perfectly cooked and crispy! My daughter and I got the meatballs and garlic bread... we ate it all up and enjoyed every bite!! 
  Our friends got the gnocchi with a wine sauce! Omg I think I ate half his plate 

   All the desserts are to die for!!! They had gluten and dairy free CREAM PUFFS!!! Hellllloo how can you not love this place!!"}
{"text":"Yelpers, oh Yelpers, why have you forsaken me? 
We were expecting a great experience with all the 5-star reviews, but we left hungry and a little grossed out.
The concept is great, but the execution falls really short; first things first, yes crepes can be sweet OR savory, but they shouldn't be sweet AND savory. Crepe commandment number one? Thou shalt not use sweet crepe batter to make a savory crepe. This place has committed a deadly crepe sin. 

We were in for lunch, and ordered two Italian wraps. Nowhere on the menu did it say the wrap (which had salamis, mozz cheese cubes, crisp lettuce, tomatoes, and garlic aioli) was wrapped in a crepe. And furthermore, they used a dessert crepe. The sweet flavor of the crepe clashed with the Italian fillings, and the delicate texture of the 'wrap' couldn't stand up to the tough salami, or the crunchy lettuce. These poor conflicted wraps, they were just terrible. 
Moving on, we had also ordered a 'not'ella crepe, again, great concept, poor execution. The homemade (Nutella inspired) filling was way off, the cocoa was much too potent, overwhelming any hazelnut flavor which may have been present. If you're going to replicate Nutella, and smother a dessert crepe, you'd better get it right...otherwise, just use the real thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
To add insult to injury, they scattered a generous amount of toasted hazelnuts all over the dish...adding crunch where it just doesn't belong, or at least isn't needed. A more purest approach wouldn't kill these people.
Also, the place is pricey, we spent just over $30 for two Italian wraps (which are served alone) and the dessert crepe. 
To their credit, the place is clean and cutesy, and the staff was pleasant and friendly. The pastries and coffee looked good...maybe a breakfast visit would have elicited more stars..."}
{"text":"I took my wife here mid-road trip on her birthday. We were excited to try some of their fancy gluten-free and dairy-free crepes. I had the Scrapple Dabble on the dairy free coconut batter. It was okay.

Pros:
100% gluten-free and well marked for other allergens
Nice counter staff

Cons:
Based on the food photos and web presence, I assumed this would be a little bit fancy and was excited to visit. It's a long and narrow cafe and definitely casual/coffee-shop vibe."}
{"text":"I'm so angry that I lived down the street from this place for years and only just discovered it recently. Their crepes are SO so good. I tried the one that I believe was called \"The Stuffed Goat\" which was full of all of my favorite things. Arugula, beets, goat cheese, blueberries, and drizzled with honey! 

Cafe Avalaun is certified as a 100% gluten free food service - but I couldn't even taste a difference. In fact, I think it was better than any crepe I've had with gluten. Gluten free is usually not my thing, it's been my experience that gluten free products are bland and dry BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE HERE AT ALL. This meal truly screwed any preconceived notions I had, and I'm glad it did!

The menu is really diverse and more than just crepes - breakfast, soup, salad, paninis, etc. I also sipped on one of their drink specials though I can't remember the name (a tea drink with turmeric) 

I will surely be back to sample more!"}
{"text":"I'm not into gluten free options however I'll make an exception for this place. The savory crepes were fantastic. You won't even think that you're eating a gluten free crepe. The downside- not enough seating for groups or small families. I hope this is something that they can address soon."}
{"text":"This is a great place for this GFer. I like the bakery selection as well as the sandwiches...and must try crepes soon!  I have purchased local products there, too, like honey. It's a nice touch. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love!!!! If you didn't know already EVERYTHING is gluten free. If I could give 10 stars I would. Of course eating anywhere where you feel safe is great, but there food is delicious!! I got the philly cheese crepe made with the dairy free coconut crepe and they also offered me dairy free cheese instead of the regular! It was soooo good. Last time I was there I won a $25 gift card for celiac awareness month! I will defiantly be going there in the mornings and taking advantage of the take away pizza nights. They have options for anyone with allergies or food intolerances, and everything is labeled and that is just the BEST"}
{"text":"Wrong combination of crepes ingredients especially DON'T TRY MANKEYS BEE-nuts!!!!  even coffee is sour !! Giving two starts only for the nice waitress."}
{"text":"I've been to cafe Avalon several times but have given up hope. I love the idea behind a paleo friendly restaurant that touts grass fed butter. The food is one hit to four misses. I had a crepe that was delicious, but other meals have proven quite lack luster.  The chicken fingers and a waffle was startlingly bad. The chicken pieces were tiny, over-cooked and sparse sitting lonely over a plain waffle. The sides consisted of something that looked and tasted exactly like corn syrup, versus maple syrup, and a splash of buffalo wing sauce. For $11 this meal was a joke. No sides, not even grass fed butter! No fruit or other niceties, just some dried up chicken slivers and a waffle.  Although some dishes are fine, but not exceptional, the portions are tiny and the prices are huge."}
{"text":"We went to Cafe Avalaun for a special Halloween event tonight. It was just as wonderful as we expected. We decorated GF cookies, ate fresh made GF corn dogs and salad. They served GL funnel cakes. I haven'Thad one of those in years.  They had some amazing dairy free hot chocoholic, lemonade with lavender, and apple cider. The owner mingled with customers and we could see him dipping and cooking the corn dogs. I invited a friend who is vegetarian and the owner cooked fried cheese dipped in corn batter, so a cheese dog I guess you would call it. He was so accommodating. We met some other similar minded customers. He had arts and crafts and even a Halloween costume contest, which he judged and he was dressed like a referee. The food here is amazing and so are the people. ."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Crepes were scrumptious, service is delightful, and attention to leaving a green footprint is wonderful. We will be back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"In the most unlikely of places, you can find this little cafe 

You'll be able to tell immediately that this place is health conscious; you can substitute almost any of their menu options to be dairy free or vegan. Even their bakery is gluten-free. For a small cafe, it boasts a pretty lengthy menu. While the standout is the crepes, they also offer paninis, salads, breakfast sandwiches, even vegan tacos! They also make some decent coffee beverages, and plenty of loose leaf teas to try from. 

We ended up getting two savory options (I'm not usually fan of sweets)- the Scrapple Dapple and the Oh Canada. For $10 each, it was a little more expensive than I expected for a cafe, but the portion size was pretty big and it did fill us up. I liked the crepe itself, but to be honest the rest of the ingredients were lacking. There wasn't a lot of flavor and it's easy to tell that they don't have a full kitchen to prepare the menu items. The combinations sound interesting, but in practice, it just falls short. You might have better luck with the sweet options, and although it didn't impress me, I'll admit this is probably the best breakfast you can get around here. 

Overall though, there's a lot of good in this cafe; it's cozy and quaint, there's plenty of seating. I think if this place was in a more up and coming area, I might be more critical. However I'll award it the benefit of the doubt for being in an unexpected area, bringing healthier options to where there may otherwise be yet another pizza wing joint."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, first rate service!
EVERYTHING is Gluten Free! Finally a place to go and enjoy a meal without worrying about food sensitivities. We
enjoyed their Italian pop up dinner tonight immensely. My daughter was especially delighted in being able to eat her two favorite dishes gluten free, Calamari and garlic bread. Everything was delicious, the portions of all their food is very generous. Second time here and will continue to recommend."}
