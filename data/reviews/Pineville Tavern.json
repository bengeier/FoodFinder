{"text":"I work off Westinghouse. Found the reviews on yelp and decided to try it. It is hands-down the best burger joint that I've found around here. As others have said, it doesn't look very inviting from the outside, but the staff is very friendly and the food is fantastic. A great find! I try to go here a couple times a month, which is a lot for me as I don't eat out most days. Just try it. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside, but their burgers are handmade to order and are thick and juicy.  Awesome.  Good onion rings, too!"}
{"text":"Flew into town from the West Coast, and this was the only place close by that Yelp showed as open at 11pm. I was really hungry. From the outside, it did not look too inviting. But, again... I was really hungry. I was served by the owner and by Melinda who was bartending. They claimed to have the best Buffalo wings in town. Wow, they were not kidding. I had the best wings I had ever had and I lived in NY state  for 4 years. They were so good that the next day, after a work related steak dinner I went back.... For wings. Don't let the exterior of the place scare you, this is an absolute must visit if you are in Fort Mill, SC."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such great reviews.  It's a dive.  Dives are good but it's a small dive with what you'd call regulars playing country music which I hate.  Not eating here, a drink and we're out!"}
{"text":"This is truly a dive bar!  I've only been there once but it felt like home!  Wings were big and meat and cooked perfectly. Sauces were good enough that I would get them again. Lisa the bartender was witty, quick with the jab and not afraid to dish it out with the regulars. Craft beer selection so-so but some cheap dive beer favorites were on tap. They have a few pool tables and a small band stand - seems like a place where you could have a lot of fun when crowded or a good chat when it was slow. Not sure if I will get a chance to return but if I feel the need to find some friends in low places....."}
{"text":"OEPN LATE!!! Don't let the outside steer you away from this neighborhood gem. Friendly owner and kind employees. Great burgers and wings. 9ft pool tables. Live music and Karoke. Very clean and neat. If it's near closing time call Don and tell him you are on your way to get some of his good eats. He'll keep the grill on for you."}
{"text":"Read reviews about this place  decided on a late lunch with a friend and we both ordered burgers.  Our sides were a salad each. The salads were plentiful and the veggies fresh.  It consisted of iceberg, grated cheese, chopped onion and diced tomatoes.  The burgers were amazing for a bar.  Hand pressed, cooked to order, fresh condiments with your choice of cheeses. Our server was attentive, but not overly so. We were only  customers in the place  except for a lone guy at the bar.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, but it's clean, has booths, tables, bar and pool tables.  Probably a great place at night on the weekends to hang with friends."}
{"text":"Got to up their rating to five stars. One year later and I'm still going here at least once a week. I've expanded my selections to burgers, grilled cheese, wings, tater tot's, onion rings oh my.  The only thing they're missing is a quesadilla. My coworker and I have been lobbying hard for this, but so far they haven't listened. But we will wear them down, considering we are in there at least Once a week.  Lol.

 What sets this place apart is the service. They really are friendly and my coworkers and I have become regulars. It's just a great place people, go visit! Get the juiciest burger you've ever had."}
{"text":"Fantastic wings! Parmesan Garlic was the best I've ever had & Goose Sauce is a fun sweet & hot house sauce. Super affordable, hole in the wall wings & beer!"}
{"text":"all good lunch today, Great wings and the burger tasted fresh and cooked perfect. This is not a fancy place at all,  GREAT SERVICE from the bar tender and the co owner/cook, Thanks again!!!"}
{"text":"Great dive bar, burgers were fabulous-lots of pool tables for fun. Friendly and good sevicdt"}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here! The first time, my husband ordered a burger and he swears it's the best burger he's ever had! I had the wings both times, the first time with BBQ and the second time with their \"goose\" sauce.(a tangy, sweet BBQ with a kick, they'll let you sample before trying) The wings are really good,hardly any fat and super crispy, my favorite! The bar tender is super sweet and always puts up with my crazy drink orders! I love dive bars and this is one of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"I have tried all the wings in town these are the crispest and the goose sauce is amazing. If you chase after great wings this place is a must."}
{"text":"Local bar and grill with awesome food and service. Burgers and wings are terrific. And these wings are not the dinky sized ones other places serve. These are big ones. And delicious. Super friendly service too!!"}
{"text":"Yum. Great bar food and friendly employees.  Had a great time here.  Why all the lengthy requirement to add words? Food was food. Service was good. Go try them out."}
{"text":"Celebrated a friends birthday at this bar their menu is pretty small however for bar food it was very good.  The wings were good n they make a few of their own sauces delish a little heat as least for me. Hamburgers very juicy an great taste. Chicken fingers were good love their fries w like a nacho cheese sauce. The owner is very friendly an they have bands sometimes. Great local place of which I love to support local more so than chain places. I wish this place the best n I'll b back I can see myself there for football on Sunday's if they will put the Steeler games on Here we steelers here we go . Check this place out if ur in Pineville right near Tyndall furniture ."}
{"text":"I stopped in because I had a really long day and the reviews were great.  I was greeted with a smile and had great service. The bartender,  Mike is very personable and fun. I ordered a burger and tots. The food came out smoking hot and delicious!! My burger was juicy and huge! I would definitely visit them again."}
{"text":"I had just checked into my hotel and was looking for a small pub with some local beer and some good wings. Being from the Buffalo area, I am pretty picky about my wings. However, this place does wings right. They were huge and tasted like real Buffalo wings. The Goose sauce was great as well. The bartender (Melinda) was talkative and extremely helpful. Also, this place is CHEAP. I couldn't believe my bill when I saw it. Would have gotten five stars but the bun of my burger was absolutely ruined. It was so soggy I had to use a fork and knife to eat it."}
{"text":"The burgers. Oh my. So good. Clearly not a frozen patty. A large half pound burger. Way more than I can eat. And tater tots cooked perfectly. It's a simple place. Lots of local folks. Service was great. I'll be back for sure!"}
