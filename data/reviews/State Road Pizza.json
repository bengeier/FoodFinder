{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place! We have tried others but always go back! They do all our sheet pizzas for parties and they can do it with a half hours notice!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Parma! Just moved here recently and have been trying all the local pizza shops and this is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Great for the price, good customer service also. Wings are ok, wasn't a fan on their Jo Jo's."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wings and great service.  The owner? was super nice and funny.  Definitely going back soon"}
{"text":"Still really good pizza - hot, room temp, or cold! That can't be said of many places. Looking at you national chains.  Their jojos have to be the best around. Seriously, they are not hunks of potatoes marginally cooked well like the competitors. Yes they are smaller, but that is why they are cooked correctly, and you get quite a bit in an order.  Spaghetti dinner is meh. Wings are pretty good, but not a fan of the cajun dry rub ones, though the wife loves them.  Again, get a website!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy it! Good chewy crust and cheap! I love getting pizza here because it's fast and good!"}
{"text":"Mmm...I've technically been a happy customer of State Road Pizza for over 20 years because they were my family go to, but tonight was the first time I ordered in a looooong time as an adult.   Everything I want in a pizzeria. Kinda homemade tasting but also kinda with that little bitta extra grease you can't get at home. They don't skimp on the sauce or the toppings. We ordered a half sheet too, which a lot of the area pizza places seem to suck at. Not here! The breadsticks are also not just not gross (like a lot of O.B./Parma pizzerias), they are truly delicious. Also got some fried cauliflower with our order tonight which was a real treat.   The price is right, the pizza is perfect, and I'm wondering why it took me so many years to come back. State Road Pizza is as good as I remember it being as a kid."}
{"text":"First time here! chicken wings were the bomb and huge! biggest wings in my area! Pizza was also very good and not greasy  I'm very pleased with this Pizza place. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Last week ordered a 3 topping pizza, could hardly find the onions or bacon. This week much better. They have to find some standards so people can find there toppings.  Still love there pies. Best in Parma."}
{"text":"My friend at work rated State Road Pizza in his top 5 local pizza places so I had to try it this weekend. A small was around $7. It tasted pretty good. Nothing to really separate itself from everything else in Parma. I could probably do a blind taste test and not pass. They are all good and all very similar. I may as well just stop going to all these different places. Actually, I can't. My hillbilly neighbor recommended Santo's Pizza in Middleburg Hts. He is a pretty big guy and I trust his opinion. He seems to know every little Mom and Pop pizza shop around the whole city."}
