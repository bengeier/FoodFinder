{"text":"I was here the other day for lunch and, as expected, there was a bit of a line.  That's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true. But waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood. When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits.   When I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.    First off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.  Fruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.  Aunties and Uncles loses points in service. The service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the College & Bathurst area."}
{"text":"This place is so good, the atmosphere is nice and the food is affordable. I was sold when they served a baked pear alongside their waffles. I like that they have coffee instead of only espresso things."}
{"text":"Heard SO much hype about this place for the longest time. Finally decided to check it out. Wow. Just wow. The service is pretty damn bad. Whoever owns this place needs to add another server on the floor. You can't have one waitress seating people AND taking orders AND running food AND cashing people out. She was very short with us and made us feel dumb for asking any question. But I'm not blaming her because I've been in that situation before. It's whoever is in charge of staffing. The food was pretty average. It's the same stuff you would get anywhere else. Just served with a side of extreme sass."}
{"text":"1. Food was great and reasonably priced.   2. Waitress (at the time I went) was rude and had poor table management.   Waitress/Hostess seated groups of two's at tables meant for four's. Later on, comes out and says I don't have table for group of four's only two's. Better table management would've moved the line a lot faster.  Waitress was rude and made snark replies when asked questions.   Summary: If you can tolerate a long line up, the place is worth visiting.  If you can not tolerate a poor service where the waitress was disrespectful and took her stress out on the patrons, I suggest going to other places.  (I'm in this category)"}
{"text":"Unlike others, I found the service quite satisfactory and not rude at all. Yes we had to wait, but we got frequent updates on when our table would be ready and the number of people we had in front of us.   However... the food just kept me wanting more. It is cheaper than other places (most items are less than $10), but not only was our food not done well, it was cold. We sat near the kitchen and I saw a Croque Monsieur sitting on the counter for a good 10 minutes. I was in one of those states where I really hoped it wasn't mine, but sure enough, it was. When it came, it was stone cold and rather unappealing.  Note: cash only."}
{"text":"had brunch with friends last Sat, lovely setup, lovely staff. but the serving was really slow, might due to the small kitchen. food here is cheap, abt $10 each. but our expectation was higher since it ranks one of the top brunch spot in toronto.  its very popular tho, ppl lined up during the whole time while we were there."}
{"text":"Torontonians love their brunch. Unfortunately, this also means brunch spots don't have to try very hard once they have an established reputation.   Our visit to Aunties and Uncles started with the waiters ignoring us for about 15minutes despite plenty of open seating. This was followed by approximately a 30-45min wait for our food once we ordered. I won't even go into how they screwed up the  order itself. There was also a healthy side of attitude from the waiter.   So yeah, come here if you have 3hrs for brunch and don't mind being treated like it is your privilege that you even get a chance to eat at this place."}
{"text":"I came here for Friday brunch with about five friends to celebrate a birthday. We were already aware that the restaurant was very popular and didn't take reservations so we were prepared to wait for a table. I had been there with my husband once before and had enjoyed the lovely Belgian waffles so I was looking forward to going again. By the time I arrived, there was already a small line trailing outside the door. The place has a lovely small patio with picnic tables and has a nice casual feel. Inside is small but cosy and kitschy in a very endearing way. Now it appeared that there were only two staff working the whole restaurant. This understandably slowed down things but it took over ten minutes for them to even acknowledge us or ask how many were in the party, how long the wait would be, etc. We were pretty easygoing about it though and in about 25 minutes we had a nice picnic table all to ourselves. By this point, we were starving. Our server was pleasant and efficient, but service was very slow. We had to ask another server to grab ours so we could order. If there had been one more server on, things would have run a lot more quickly.   I ordered the Cinnamon French Toast and once it arrived, I remembered why people line up to get in the place. It was so good. Three generous slices of toast with syrup on the side and fruit (strawberries and melons). The toast also has a salty tinge, Im not sure from what, but it really adds to the flavour. I could only finish two slices and the side of fruit before I had to call it quits.  IMPORTANT NOTE: They only take cash here and the receipt doesn't list what you ate only the individual prices, which makes it hard to separate your items when you don't remember how much your meal cost. We just ended up splitting it 6 ways to make it easier.   Overall, the food is really wonderful and if you are willing to wait and be patient with the service, it may be worth it to you. To tell you the truth, I probably won't go back simply because I would rather go to a greasy spoon and get food faster even if it isn't quite as good. I did not enjoy my French Toast as much as I could have because by the time it came my way, I was way too hangry (hungry and angry) to really slow down and enjoy myself."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a Wednesday so thankfully seating and service wasn't an issue. The guy was friendly and helpful, which makes me think this is a restaurant much more suitable and enjoyable for a quiet weekday.   I know the mismatched furniture and decorations are overdone, nothing special, yada yada..but I enjoyed it seeing as I haven't been to many restaurants like this in Toronto. It was pleasant and gave my eyes something to explore while you waited for the food.   I had their Vegetarian sandwich Pan Bagnat sandwich, it was fantastic. My memories absolutely terrible but I recall there being sun-dried tomatoes that made the sandwich particularly tasty.   All in all, come on a weekday when it's less busy and you're not in a rush, and it'll be lovely."}
{"text":"DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE HYPE. Sorry but I really cant understand how this was the highest rated Toronto breakfast and brunch restaurant.  First time you yelpers have steered me wrong and Im pissed... Food was medicocure at best, Im sure this place has been around a long time and maybe I would need another go at it but I just dont want to. There was nothing appaling about my visit, except for the 12 pairs of rayban wayfares I counted on the patrons waiting outside to be seated. Went on a Saturday around 11am, and the two us waited an hour to be seated. (After reading reviews we were actually expecting that) Food came out 20 minutes later and it just wasnt worth it. We got the egg tacos and breakfast pocket as recommended on yelp and it was just ok.  Ingredients tasted cheap, and overcompensated by too much salt and onions. yuck!  As we left my boyfirend summed it up quite truthfully, \"I would have rather just eaten at a Sunset Grill...\"  (Not knocking the grill, just putting it into perspective) As a recommendation, if you actually appreciate breakfast food, go to Lady Marmalade on Queen East. Food is incredible, and they actually have Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:50am on a Sunday morning. Waited 40 minutes for a table for 2. (This was what I expected, as I had read prior reviews on Yelp, so I did not have a problem with this.) The hostess guestimated a wait of 25 minutes (I don't blame her for being under, since I can imagine it's hard to predict.)  NOTE: Go to the front of the line and put your name down on the list. There were other people who just joined the line, but did not realize they needed to have their name on the list, which is what it went by.  Had the Breakfast Pocket and Cinnamon French Toast. Was it yummy? Yes. Was it worth the wait? No.   Took really long for them to bring the food. Spent 2/3rds of our time there waiting and 1/3rd actually eating.  Also noticed that their seating system, namely upstairs, is very inefficient.  Despite a long line-up of people outside, there were two empty tables around me that remained empty for a very long time. Hostess did not do a good job of realizing there were empty tables. (This isn't a problem downstairs as customers would see the empty tables and point them out.)"}
{"text":"The place is great!  Food was outstanding (I got omelette of the day, spinach/havarti/zucchini), homemade ketchup / jam was awesome, bread was different and great, staff very friendly.   It's a very casual place, not fancy, just a comfy dinner.  I am excited to go again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Aunties & Uncles. I have heard great things about it and that it is one of Toronto's best brunch places. The food was great but I have never experienced worse service in my life. The second we arrived there we were not greeted properly by the server. We were awkwardly standing in front of him for a few minutes until he would acknowledge us to seat us. It seemed like we were asking SO much of him to give us a seat. Then our waitress came over, cut right to the chase, didnt ask how we were doing etc. and just asked for our orders with a scowl on her face. Neither of the servers there looked happy to be working, they looked seriously pained to be serving customers. It seriously felt like we were inconveniencing them by being there.   I hope the owner of the restaurant realizes that his employees are the worst I have ever seen and lack basic customer service skills."}
{"text":"It's a cute little restaurant nicely decorated with vintage taste. I went there around 1:30 on Sunday for the first time, and yes, two couples were waiting. But I guess they were waiting for the seats in the patio because I found some empty seats and tables inside which I could be seated shortly after my arrival.   I ordered the omelet of the day with potato salad, which was quite the quantity and fairy priced. It was very good, actually, but not like \"the best.\"   I would recommend this place to everyone who wants to enjoy their morning & afternoon with friends, boy/girlfriends and families in happy and cozy atmosphere. You won't be disappointed. But if you are expecting the best branch you've ever had, maybe there are more options to be explored."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Environment is charming and cozy without trying too hard.  I had the special omelette with havarti and red peppers with a side of hash browns and challah toast.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The chef pumps out the food so quick and still looks relaxed and happy."}
{"text":"I am coming to this place for the last 7 years. Always amazing food. Nice atmosphere.  Omelettes are my thing in this place. They always perfectly done. Mmm their potato salad. I can not stop eating it. If you have a sweet tooth pancakes here are a must!!! Great place and great price. 5 starts breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Our first day in Toronto got off to a great start with brunch here. One big mistake was each ordering a meal rather than sharing one. Generous servings. Swiss, bacon, and egg sandwich with grilled peppers was very good. Hash browns were exceptional, crunchy outside, tender inside, I think I detected a hint of garlic. It may sound crazy,but,the ketchup was amazing. Good service, funky atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here many times, always good home cooked style food. Generous portions and fast easy going service. Get's pretty busy for the breakfast/brunch crowd, bit of a hipster hangout, but who's complaining?"}
{"text":"I just moved to Toronto and this was my first dining out experience.  Was digging the atmosphere on my jaunt to the bathroom.  Had to wait a minute for someone to come out.  Turns out the person worked there because I found her pen and pad on top of the toilet--scribbled on the front were the words \"tacos no meat\".  Little did I know she would eventually be my waitress AN HOUR LATER.  I am certain I wouldn't have waited that long if someone ANYONE had had the human decency to come out and greet us and put our name on a list and communicated just how backed up they were.  Tables opened up, but no one was cleaning them.  When I tried to engage one of the people that worked there, they acted as if it was the biggest inconvenience ever to ask them a question.  In any event, I don't want to waste any more of my time here, but needless to say the food was definitely not worth the wait or the attitude.   Obviously, no child ever says to their parent they want to work in the food industry when they grow up.  We all know you don't want to be there, but if you're convinced you're so amazing you don't belong there THEN ACT LIKE YOU'RE SO AMAZING YOU DON'T BELONG THERE!!!  We'll believe you through your generosity and good service."}
{"text":"We are from Montreal and had a plane to catch at 2 from island city airport. We needed to be there by 1:30 so we arrived at 11:15. Not only did we wait in line for an hour (we were told to get in line), but when we got to the front and explained our situation, the very rude waitress told us it was basically too bad as there would be another 30-40 minute wait for our food. We asked if they could bump up our order as we had waited in line for an hour and she was awful: she said we should have told her this before we waited in line (even though she had told us to!) and we are now on our way to find another breakfast. I don't know if any other restaurant where you wait so long to be seated that doesn't have a quick turnover once you order. Disappointing and would never go back there."}
{"text":"I came here on a thursday so thankfully i did not have to wait to be seated! I opted for the breakfast pocket which tasted quite lovely. It was super flavourful and had that yummy home made taste that i love. Theres nothing over the price of 10 bucks which is awesome especially since the portions are quite big. The server that i had was super hilarious and sarcastic so i had a lot of fun with him. Seriously try this place out!"}
{"text":"I love the decor. The food is really good, too. Well worth the sometimes very long wait."}
{"text":"I was craving brunch and decided to check this place out as I heard alot of good things about it from BlogTO and yelp. Sadly I was very disappointed....   My friend and I went during a school day so thank god we didn't have to wait in line as I was starving. Stepping into the place,  the interior was very hipster, cute and homey.   As for the food...  My friend ordered the fish tacos which wasn't bad but not crazy delicious either. I ordered the blueberry pancakes and let me tell you how much I regretted that choice. (NEVER ORDER THE BLUEBERRY PANCAKES. I REPEAT NEVER.) They weren't even cooked properly so I was basically eating raw pancake batter; it was gross, tasteless and absolutely nasty. I felt very nauseous eating it after.  Secondly, they didn't have ice and when we asked the server why it was because they didn't have space for it. WHAT KIND OF A RESTAURANT DOES NOT HAVE ICE?!?! because that was my first time hearing that. Also the service wasn't the greatest but he made of had a bad day so I'll just pass on reviewing that.  Overall, this brunch place was a big let down and personally I think it's just the hype because it definitely didn't live up to my expectations of what I have heard. Usually I wouldn't care so much for the service or how the place looks as long as the food is good and mouthwatering but the food here was okay and the blueberry pancakes were terrible. Hence, I, definitely will not be coming back for a second round.  To Note: I did overhear the server and chef talking about how the grill wasn't hot enough for the pancakes. The fact that they still decided to serve it to their customers is a big NO NO."}
{"text":"I read a lot of good reviews for Aunties & Uncles and always saw a crowd waiting to get in on sunday mornings. So one sunday i braved it all to get a spot and order some of their well regarded brunch items. It was good, typical greasy spoon breakfast served in a heart warming, greasy old diner. I liked the atmosphere, the coziness and the warmth (literally) coming from the centrally located kitchen. However i did not find anything special or unique to write home about."}
{"text":"Amazing food for their price. Cute place, but the place is overrated. The lineups on weekends are wayyy too long."}
{"text":"I love that place! Waiting in row for half an hour is definitely worth it having your breakfast here! Its very cosy in here and you gonna feel like back in The 50's. The food, at last but not least, is incredible good! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This spot is so good, I almost didn't include it in my reviews. Truthfully, if I wasn't so desperate at this point to keep coming up with places, I would have kept it to myself. It's like a house with mix matched cutlery and plates. Two floors of total living room feel. The waiters all have beards (except the girls obviously), and are a perfect reflection of the clientele, a kind of west end hippy musician type with beards and lots of hand-knit sweaters.   West end hippy musician types aside, the breakfast here is fantastic and in the summer they have a great little patio. This place is so good, that you have to be at least a three-peat booty call before I'll take you here the next day. Fo real."}
{"text":"Aunties and uncles has a delicious grilled Canadian cheddar with bacon. This goes really well with their homemade ketchup. I've been to this place several times and I always end up getting the grilled Canadian cheddar. The pancakes were good but not fluffy enough. Be prepared for a long wait on the weekends. Also, it's cash only which is inconvenient"}
{"text":"I love this place, great food, good price and it is like Queen St west from 20 years ago."}
{"text":"This place have gained popularity in the last few years for its weekend brunch After thinking for a long time I finally arrived o. A Saturday, but lord the Sunday brunch was crazy. All the restaurant in that matter were pretty packed.   Had to wait for more than an hour,  we ordered food but it came after another 15mins. Finally when I was ready to eat a full on lunch I finally got my breakfast.  The food was not too bad, but the wait was probably not worth it. Will try it once again."}
{"text":"I visited this place on a Friday morning last winter. My oh my the wait is kinda long, probably around 40mins. I was with a pregnant friend of mine so she waited in the car while I half-freeze myself standing near the door.   Don`t expect for fine Chinas when u dine here, this place is unpretentious with hip servers. Which makes the ambiance quirky-charming.   I had the breakfast taco while my friend had the club. What i had was good but not mind blowing. I like their freshly brewed coffee, it doesn't leave you with a sour stomach. I will comeback to this joint and try the French toast. Looks like its everyone's top meal to order."}
{"text":"I don't get why a place with such fashionably bad service draws such staggeringly good reviews. Yeah, the food is tasty and yeah, it's cheap but the snobby service is enough to sour the whole experience. As much effort as I make to strategically seek out local businesses to support in this city, Aunties & Uncles is not one I will revisit. Unfortunate, as everything else about this place is worthy of a U-turn.  I serve and I work hard for my tips. Here's a bit of advice from server to patron: If the server's effort is beyond flatlining, just don't. Gratuity is earned, not entitled."}
{"text":"Dropped by around 2 on a Saturday afternoon  to find a line outside. Luckily my boyfriend and I were able to grab a seat immediately since there were only two of us.   The breakfast pocket was amazing! The pocket (focaccia bread) was filled with perfectly cooked scrambled eggs, pemeal bacon, cheddar, tomato, dijon and ailoi. Oh - and my favourite part, the caramelized onions. Definitely one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. I was also surprised by the size of it too. It came with two large halves... all for only $8.75 which included a choice of potato salad, hash browns or salad. I went with the hashbrowns which were prettty chunky and consisted of regular and sweet potatoes.  My boyfriend went with the banana oatmeal pancakes ($7.50). They weren't light and fluffy.. a little bit on the denser side because of the bananas, but it was not bad. Nice and crispy on the outsides. Although I wasn't totally in love with them, my boyfriend really enjoyed it.  What a great ltitle hipster-filled brunch spot. Great food and great prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Aunties and Uncles is everything everyone says it is. I had the breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs, chorizo, red cabbage and salsa.  The menu said it came with coriander sour cream on the side, although mine tasted nothing like coriander.  You have a choice of potato salad, green salad or hashbrowns with your breakfast and I chose the hashbrowns.  They were total pan-fried yukon gold and sweet potato goodness.  Comfort food if ever I've had it!  As is my m.o., in addition to my savoury dish, I ordered a sweet dish -- in this case, the cinnamon french toast.  They make it with challah bread and it was simply divine.    I asked for a cafe au lait and the server sort of stared at me, so I explained that it's just a latte with more milk and less foam.  She brought me something that was perfectly fine, but I don't understand why it's not on more menus?  As I was leaving, a table was seated next to me and someone asked for a cafe au lait.  I just smiled to myself. :-)  I was a party of one and had to wait about ten minutes before I was seated, even when I got there at 9:50am on a Sunday.  Be prepared to wait.  Whatever time you spend waiting, though, will be given right back to you ten fold once you take your first bite at Aunties and Uncles."}
{"text":"Went here today because of the rave reviews. I was totally underwhelmed.  Service was slow (in every respect; from getting our name down on the list, to getting a table, to getting food. It took over an hour and a half from arriving to actually having food in front of us), the waitresses were rude and from what I overheard when somebody asked, they use battery farmed eggs for their breakfasts. Not exactly fitting with the whole bohemian vibe they seem to exude.  Food was strictly meh. No idea why this rates so high and why people are queuing to get in. I will not be back and neither will the rest of the people I came with."}
{"text":"Breakfast burger with brie and bacon.  Breakfast tacos with housemade chorizo, beans and eggs.  Yum yum yum!  Loved the olives that came with.  And service was relaxed (=if you're in a rush, you may say slow) but very very friendly."}
{"text":"We were prepared to wait (based upon other reviews) and wehad to wait about 35-40 minutes this past saturday. Food was good but not fancy. I had the cinnamon french toasts."}
{"text":"Went on a tuesday at 12 noon. Got a seat after a 5 minute wait. Place emptied out 20 mins later though. Our simple right-off-menu table of 3 took 40 minutes to make. Even just getting our drinks (tap water and 2 juices) took 12 minutes after ordering.   The food was amazing. Worth the wait IF you're not on your work lunch hour. Had the walnut brie pear sandwich, breakfast burger, soup and salad. Their side potato salad is to die for, I want to buy buckets of it.   This place opperates on a lazy weekend clock every day I suppose, which is unfortunate as people should avoid it if they're working folk. Clearly they're not hurting for business though, so I suppose it fills a niche.   Based on other reviewers though, I wish their servers and cooks moved much faster, gain a higher turnover and make more money to expand. I could see this food going franchise if their timing was fixed.  Also, there are still places that do cash only! so antiquated."}
{"text":"The line up outside is definitely a good indicator of the delicious food inside. Not a place to go to if you're in Amy sort of rush, but for a leisurely brunch, this is a wicked Toronto spot. Both my and my friend's meals were delicious and portions were generous! Very reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"Pros: Food Price  Cons: Everything else  We got there and there and there were about 3 couples in front of us so we decided to wait around as it didn't appear that getting a table would take too long. Just as we were about to be seated a couple showed up that put their name on the waiting list previously but missed their name when it was called. The server still proceeded to seat them ahead of us. Believe it or not, this actually happened three more times. Apparently you can put your name on the list and show up any time you want and you will take precedent over those that actually stuck around to wait it out.  Upon questioning the server about this policy, she rudely responded that this is how they have been doing it for 12 years and that we would just have to wait.   Eventually we got seated after about a 35 minute wait only to be served by the most dull, disinterested waitress. She literally did not say more than a few words over the entire time we were there. I had to ask for a coffee refill even though she could clearly see my coffee mug was empty the 10 times she had walked past us.   The service was just truly terrible and it is unfortunate because this place has a lot of potential based on the food/location/decor. I have been to other places in Toronto with both better food and service. Skip it unless you go on an off-peak time because this place is definitely not worth the wait. The people who have given this place good reviews clearly are accustomed to this type of poor service, which is rather sad."}
{"text":"Small restaurant. Long wait but worth it. Breakfast burger was unreal. Croque Monsieur was awesome. Hash browns were great. Potato salad had too much dill."}
{"text":"I went to Aunties & Uncles after searching \"pancakes Toronto\" and reading some Yelp reviews. The line up both times were long (20-30 mins). There were a couple of times when my friend and I would decide to go somewhere else because of the line. The inside is very retro and homey, albeit tiny.  The two times that I actually sat down I was so satisfied with my meals. Their pancakes and french toast are really delicious (who doesn't love bananas in their pancakes?). What I really liked about them was that the fruits served with the pancakes and french toast was poached pear! It went wonderfully with the pancakes and french toast.  The second time I went I had something savory, the omelette. My friend had the breakfast pocket (she really liked it, said the bread was really good). My omelette had spinach, green onion, tomato and havarti. It was a really nice combination of flavours in the omelette (probably the best omelette I've ever had). For the sides, we chose has browns and potato salad. The hash browns were fantastic, cooked red skin potatoes (MUCH better than the deep fried frozen stuff). The potato salad was also spectacular, with dill and dijon. I loved the salad, but my friend said there was too much dill.  If you can stand the wait, or time your breakfast/brunch, do give it a try. It's really good food."}
{"text":"A funky little diner that seems to popular no matter what time of day or week you go.  Note: cash only.  Menu has some great options to choose from including daily specials.  Had the Breakfast Tacos (Scrambled Eggs, Pinto Beans, Cheddar, House-made Chorizo Sausage and Cilantro Sour Cream on Soft Corn Tortillas) was served with home fries (of the hash brown from scratch variety!!!)  Serving size was ample without going over board.  The meal was tasty and satisfying especially for the price.  Scrambled eggs.... which can be a gamble in a restaurant were done just right... not runny or dry.  Much appreciated.  Also appreciated the modest amount of cheese that didn't overpower the dish.  Coffee.... average diner coffee, nothing to get excited about one way or the other.  Table service was average.  No complaints and no wow's either.  The washroom facilities are a bit of an adventure - down a steep set of stairs into the basement.  As far as basement washrooms go.... a decent effort had been made to keep it bright and clean.  Not a lot of space and no hook to hang a coat.  Went on a week day so had no problems getting a table.  Sounds like there are lengthy waits over the weekend.  Final note:  the website gives the address on Lippencott Avenue.  It's on Lippencott Street."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's worthwhile arriving early, that is true, but we went at 10am on a sunday and we were seated without any major wait.  Service was friendly, understanding, and very quick -- more on that later.  I had scrambled eggs with bagel, greens, and fruit. Eggs were perfectly \"baveux\", just the right texture between raw and cooked. Bagel was fine, fruit was nothing to write home about, some cantaloupe and grapes. Greens were a basic mix. But I enjoyed it overall.  One friend had the breakfast tacos, which were excellent. Decently spiced with the right proportions of ingredients.  Another friend had the pancakes -- banana oatmeal today. If you order these, beware, it IS a giant pile of stodge. 3 pancakes is heavy and could be too much if you're not into that. But the flavour was good, the batter was nice and fluffy, and they provided enough syrup to go with.  Our fourth member had the belgian waffles. He later said that he would rather have had the pancakes, but I was very impressed with his waffles. Too often belgian waffles are dry and boring, but these were exceptionally crisp on the outside, while being light, fluffy, with just the right amount of egg in the batter. I tend to avoid belgian waffles because I'm usually disappointed, so I'm no expert, but these were definitely the best I've had and I would order them without a second thought.  Coming back to the service, the reason that it's so quick is that they have obviously standardised a lot of their recipes. In the kitchen they must have giant piles of everything -- scrambled eggs, potatoes, fruit, etc. -- which they just spoon onto your plate. So if you're extremely picky, and like your eggs over-medium \"just so\", then you'll probably be disappointed. But as someone just out to enjoy a summer brunch on the patio, it was a welcome change not to wait 40 minutes even when it was busy.   And plus the price is reasonable. Less than $10 a head, with some people ordering coffee/tea. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place will serve you the best breakfast you can find in the area. Maybe even the city, as I have not been to a diner that even comes close to as good as this place is. They even make their own ketchup, which is delicious and tangy. Everything I've ever had at this place has been spot on. I never, ever regret going/waiting in line.  The servers are really hardworking amazing people that do their best in a work situation that is jammed literally every time they're open. Give them good tips, they really deserve it. They might not be smiling ear to ear when they see you like an asshole, but they are kind and that's all you as the customer should really expect of them. Get over yourself.  I love the servers, the food, the decor, and the feeling of satisfaction that I have every time I walk out of this wonderful little diner. Keep on doing what you're doing Auntie's and Uncles! Never change. The basic take away here: This place is great if you are not a whiney adult baby that needs their diaper changed."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the service was just fair. We had to ask our waitress for water refills and my boyfriend asked for more coffee and never got a refill. I ordered the omelette of the day and a half-size of the banana oatmeal pancakes (I was craving savory and sweet) and both were delicious. Definitely an excellent hipster spot, but like many other posts suggest...you can anticipate a long wait.   Final suggestion to staff: A smile and some drink refills can go a long way!"}
{"text":"Definitely get the banana oatmeal pancakes. Also highly recommend the potato salad. Even the toast is amazing.  Worth the line up and the wait."}
{"text":"Cute and kitschy, with a very nostalgic feel. I prefer this place in the summertime, because they have a nice big patio and the line goes more quickly. Unless you go early, the wait can be very long. However, the service is friendly, the portions are generous and the prices are reasonable. Great challah toast!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the popularity of this place. Everything on their menu can easily be made at home for a fraction of the cost, and you won't have to line up and wait to be served for AGES. Not worth it at all there are many many many far better brunch restaurants in the city. Like come on it's just basics please do something at least a little interesting!"}
{"text":"Alright food, shitty shitty SHITTY service. I guess it's a \"hip\" spot. It's just a wanna-be Mimi's (back in the day on Bathurst just north of Queen, best brunch spot of all time that unfortunately isn't with us anymore...)  Would not suggest this spot. Wanna-be people. wanna-be food."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not necessarily worth the wait. I've been there more than a few times when the wait is more than 40 minutes (sometimes in the rain) for a table, and while the food is good, it's not THAT good. The service is also often slow, and the usual hostess gives one the impression she thinks she's doing you a favour deigning to serve you. Also, fair warning: bring cash. They don't take anything else."}
{"text":"A really great breakfast spot.  My fiancé and I stopped by here on a weekday morning (so there was no wait).  We split the banana oatmeal pancakes and the pan bagnat (a Mediterranean inspired salad on focaccia).  Both were delicious, especially the pancakes (some of the best I've ever tasted).  Combined with the friendly service and reasonable prices, this place is definitely a winner."}
{"text":"Getting a table at Aunties & Uncles for brunch may require a wait but it is sooo worth it!  Their French Toast is to die for, prices are fair, and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"What can I say? Love!  I'm all about trying new places for brunch but when I just can't risk a bad experience off to Auntie's & Uncles it is! Several visits and never a bad experience.  You will wait in line and it will be worth it. I recently realized that I always order the breakfast pocket sans bacon. I can't help it...it's just sooo tasty! I broke my funk with the omelette of the day which was heavenly. Well played Aunties & Uncles - well played!  Go there - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious food-- definitely worth the wait!  Banana pancakes were amazing... and the decor inside is unique. Will definitely come back if I'm in town."}
{"text":"Low to no hope upon first sight.  Boy was I wrong.  For a small place and kitschy decor it was big on service and taste.  A definite brunch spot for any who are looking for something non mainstream. Club sandwich was amaz and burger was uber juicy.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Overall: This place is an experience to go to. IF you are looking to have spear hour and a half with your friends. Places is very interesting on the inside, homey, filled with hipsters of all kinds:)  Good: Food was really good on two orders (classic club sandwich, pancakes with pear) and just mediocre on the last one (waffled)  Bad: Portions were tiny, we went with 3 small girls and two of us left hungry...I could not imagine this portion to feed a guy....  It took us 1 hour outside in the line and then anther 40 min inside to get the food.... Server was pretty abrupt and avoided coming near the tables so people would not complain about the wait...."}
{"text":"Omg best brunch ever. The place is a total dive/whole in the wall...but sooo good. It has been moons since I have been there but I remember getting the BLT on challah(ironic I know) and it was amazing. This place always has a long line up."}
{"text":"Two of my best girlfriends and I visited Aunties & Uncles over St. Paddy's Day weekend for an early breakfast after reading really good reviews. We are all brunch/breakfast food fanatics so any time a place gets a four-star review or higher, we know we just gotta check it out for ourselves.  I can't speak for my friends, but personally I found this place to be a bit hyped up for what you get. We all ended up ordering the banana oatmeal pancakes with a side of peameal bacon and homefries (minus one of us who substituted the homefries with potatoe salad). I found the service really quite slow here and it wasn't even busy. We arrived at 9:30 am on Sunday and the place was moderately filled. By the time our food came around I was a bit disappointed at the flavour and consistency of the pancakes. If it wasn't for the maple syrup and the fact that I was starving, I don't even know if I would have finished them. The overall flavour was very bland and it was really the gritt of the oatmeal that gave it any kind of sustenance. To me, pancakes should be light and fluffy on the inside. Instead, these pancakes were too gooey for my likes (pretty sure the banana wasn't cooked enough). The peameal bacon was fine as were the homefries. I do have to say that the dill potatoe salad was very good and a group behind us ordered the cinnamon french toast which I would try if I ever go back.   I don't want to bash this place because it does get good reviews so I am thinking that maybe my pancakes just weren't done properly.   Give it a try but I would recommend ordering their french toast or an egg dish."}
{"text":"I've always liked the food here but we rarely go anymore because only idiots line up for food. Sooooo.....we were heading to the market for breakfast early on a Saturday morning recently and A & U's is on our path and I suggested we stop in there instead as it was just opening and there were only a few toque-wearing hipsters mingling around (Whew!) We grabbed a patio seat and ordered pretty quickly.   The server brought some water and proceeded to spill my glass all over my crotch. Hey little fella, time to wake up! I'm a chilled guy and was not upset about it but her response? \"Well at least it was only water, right?\" Oh right, just water. How about I do the ice bucket challenge over your way-too-pierced face and clown make-up and see if you are okay with it? Perhaps offering a free juice or some other token gesture would have been a good idea since you now made me look like the hobo sitting across the street with the giant piss stain (Actually maybe he just ate there too?) Attention too-fucking-cool for you hipster servers: You are there to do a job. Pretend you like it so customers feel somewhat welcome. If not go get another gig.   Oh yea the food. It was tasty. Like I said I've always enjoyed the food here. Solid breakfast. This lack of professional service is becoming a way too common theme in T.O. but it's a shitty job, we get it. But it's still a job so try a little harder. It won't go unnoticed we promise!"}
{"text":"Heard great reviews about Aunties and Uncles and decided to give it a try.  It was definitely worth the visit the food was incredible.  We ordered the omelette of the day, the breakfast tacos and the pancakes.  Both the potato salad and home fries (with the home made ketchup) were outstanding.  The pancakes came with cinnamon coated fruit and real maple syrup.     Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because we went on a Monday and it was still a significant wait.  If you have a lot of time to kill, check out this restaurant.  There are only 2 cooks in the back and 2 servers running the show so you have to give them your patience because the food is made to order."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so badly. The food is consistent and good, and it's super close to home. However, with each visit my disdain towards Aunties and Uncles grows due to the extremely poor service I've received.   It's one thing to receive poor service once. The server is having a bad day, the kitchen is backed up more than usual, etc etc. I understand that this happens. Nonetheless, I have now been here a few times over the span of a couple of years and the service has remained unpleasant with each visit. My boyfriend and I ate here for breakfast, and it was busy but not busy enough to justify the service we received. After waiting around 50 minutes for our food, we noticed that everyone who was seated on the patio around us had received their food except for us. It is imperative here to note that my issue with this stems from the fact that many of these people had been seated welllllllll after us. It's also important to note that we didn't order anything out of the ordinary or with special modifications that could have possibly made the food take longer to make.   This would not be a huge issue if it was at least acknowledged by our server. However, it seemed as though she was blatantly avoiding us and never approached or even looked in our direction between the (long) time it took to place our order and pay for our bill. To be honest, all we wanted (in addition to a water top-up which we never got) was some sort of explanation as to why everyone around us got their food before us.   My feelings towards this place were not made any better during my most recent visit, when our server spilled hot coffee all over my legs and made no apology at all. So so much potential, but the staff need a serious attitude check because a whole place - regardless of how yummy their food is - can be ruined by poor service."}
{"text":"The management of this place needs to get its act together.  I feel a bit of a drama queen/megabitch writing a review for a place where I've never actually eaten the food, but my experience waiting for a table this afternoon at A&U was ridiculous. I'm a regular at places such as Bonjour Brioche and Lady Marmalade; I don't mind waiting for brunch, nor do I get overly irritated by cash only policies or even the slightly snobby-trying-to-be-Parisian-and-failing-type-service in places such as the above...but I do expect to see more than one staff member working the floor at 1pm on a Sunday in the supposedly 'best brunch in Toronto' cafe.  We waited for 25+ minutes behind about twelve people (none of whom were seated in that time) and eventually politely asked the waitress why there were two glaringly empty and available tables ready, with no one being seated in them. The waitress laughed and explained that the kitchen was backed up so there would be no point seating people. I sort of get that, and she was polite in her explanation, but the fact that the other staff member was running around doing everything while this individual stood there doing nothing was irritating to say the least.  How hard is it to call an extra staff member in to cover the rush period?! Retail/hospitality management basic no. 1.  I got the sense that the staff didn't care whether we stayed or left. We left and went elsewhere.   Then I come on Yelp and see that this phenomenon of only having one or two people working on weekend brunch time is the norm here. What the hell?!   I'd love to end this review on a positive and say something like ''despite this, I'm eager to return and try the food'', but I live in the east end, and while I wouldn't rule out a return here entirely, I certainly won't be travelling across the city with the specific aim of trying this place after the disappointing experience today.  Proof that service is just as important as the food served."}
{"text":"Good location. Warm welcoming home kitchen atmosphere. Fair price. Ordered banana oatmeal pancake. I will say it is average. Delicious but nothing special. It is not puffy enough for me. They just put the oatmeal on top. I expected more. Kind of disappointed because of me high expectation. But still a cute place to go."}
{"text":"Food looks great, kitchen folk look focused and on point. The service is absolutely atrocious. The owner needs to send in secret diners and observe some of the service staff. Send in a few difficult diners and see how quickly the initial disinterest turns into well you can go fuck yourself."}
{"text":"It's been six months since I've been here so perhaps my review is a little skewed but I found this place to be pretty overrated too be honest. It's essentially a glorified diner if that's your thing. Don't line up, go to the exceptional Voodoo Child around the corner instead.  Oh yeah and cash only."}
{"text":"Decent food. Wait was estimated at 15-20 and took 40 minutes. The chicken bacon club wasn't bad and the brie black forest ham was quite decent. Not 5/5 but the price was right, a 3.5 in my books, 3 for the wait. Will come again on a non-weekend to try other items."}
{"text":"We went to this place because it had awesome reviews. We did not sit inside so didn't get to see the vintage look but sat outside as it was a beautiful day! What a great front patio! Lots of space to sit outside. For breakfast I had the breakfast pocket and home fries. It was alright. There was not anything special. The sandwich had Dijon mustard that tastes like it was tarragon Dijon ; it complimented the sandwich quite nicely. The downside was that the potatoes were a little al-dente and as I recall this is a pasta requirement not a root veggie requirement. The eggs, well they looked different and tasted different, they made me think of the pre-mixed scrambled eggs you buy in a carton. I thought I was crazy to think this but my friend also brought it up.   All in all this was a good breakfast place. Would I order the same thing next time? Probably not. Would I go again? Sure."}
{"text":"Followed the Yelp crowd to this popular brunch spot and I do want want to thank all fellow Yelpers for it. We had the breakfast pocket and burrito and both were fantastic. Those dill and Dijon potatoes everyone was raving about was worth all the hype. Extremely friendly staff and service was prompt which is nice when your waiting for your first meal of the day. Can't wait til summer to enjoy their brunch on tha patio."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Simply the best brunch in this part of town. But go early - sometimes you might have trouble getting a table, and you WILL have to wait half an hour for your food. Be prepared to spend a lot of time getting to know your breakfast companion while you wait!! It's worth it for the delectable french toast and sandwiches, though."}
{"text":"My friend loves brunch and decided that we needed to try this place out. Luckily we came on a cold, cloudy April day so that wait was only 20 minutes. Yay! I love the feel of the restaurant. Very old diner like with a hint of grandma's kitchen. The smell from the food was intoxicating.   I ordered the Breakfast pocket with potato salad. Let me just say, great portion size for what we were charge (I couldn't even finish it!). Food itself is simple but delicious (nothing fancy, just plain brunch food). My friend enjoyed it because of the fact that it was exactly what you expected from it.  Overall, I would come back to Aunties & Uncles if I ever wanted simple brunch food that is filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"Had brunch here - good food, good staff. Breakfast tacos were decent, fries were delicious. Got a table right away but after we arrived there were a lot of people waiting. The staff was very friendly and the food was filling and affordable. What else can you really ask from brunch? (NB cash only!)"}
{"text":"Waiting is a part of the experience, but well worth it as you get inside (or out)  - inside is my favorite due to the amount of knick knacks and being within earshot of the kitchen banter. It reminds me of someone's cottage, and the food is just as home cooked. It's my favorite place to go with a few pals on a lazy Sunday"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once and yes I waited (for about 20 minutes outside).  I wouldn't go in the winter for this reason alone.  However, once seated we were served quickly and the food was delicious.  It definitely is cozy inside but everyone seemed to be in a good mood so it worked.  I would go prepared to wait and knowing that the space is small.  Then you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has gotten lots of fan fare, and has some good attributes, but my latest experience there was sub-par. It's tiny, so you always have to wait and they seem fairly slow an turning over tables. With a giant line outside we still waiting 25 minutes for our food after ordering. The pocket sandwich was disappointing, particularly the bread but the whole thing just didn't do it for me. Egg was boring, sauce lacking. Their home fries are great, but to be honest there are many other places in the area I'd rather go."}
{"text":"Who are these hipster aunties and uncles and why are they so popular?  After numerous recommendations to visit Aunties and Uncles, I finally did this Sunday afternoon at 2pm. We figured it was smart to go just before closing so it'd be dying down by then... wrong! We still waited 30 minutes for a table.  Now, many enjoy A&U's decor but for me, it was just an example of using the term \"hipster\" to be not well-put-together. Like, that hideous staircase leading up to the second floor? That's just a case waiting for Occupational Health & Safety. I do like restaurants with unique character, but this place looked like it's owned by a bunch of Hoarders who couldn't be bothered to collect decent/matching tables and chairs and unloaded any random crap onto the walls. It was a very faux-homely vibe...  Anyway, onto the food. My food was GOOD. I had the daily omelette which contained mushrooms, spinach and havarti!!! Yay!!! It was a really excellent omelette. They actually loaded up the thing with lots of mushrooms which, for a mushroom monster like myself, is like a shiny new ornament for Christmas. If it wasn't for the fact that I actually have chest tightness each time I eat a big greasy breakfast out, I would've finished every bit of my plate (yea.... I should stop, I am definitely slowly killing myself). The hashbrowns were also really good: soft potato chunks with salted crispy on the skin.  My girlfriend had the Breakfast Pocket... I don't think it's my thing, but seems to be a very popular choice!  All in all, it was a good experience minus the decor (which for some may be experience in itself), but I don't think I'll be going back soon just because I should probably not seek out a heart attack so often.   atmosphere - 1/5 service -  3/5 food - 3.5/5 price - 4/5"}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving breakfast food at 11:30 and reached out to yelp for a little help.  Aunties & Uncles got rave reviews, so we ventured out in search of exceptional brunch.  The food. was. awesome.  I'm a little harsh on here, normally, but it was great.  I ordered the banana oat pancakes.  They were fluffy, had great banana flavor (without being overpowering) and were just enough to leave you comfortably full.  They came with a side of fruit, which worked perfectly.  The hubby ordered the eggs with bacon and toast.  The bacon was thick cut, a little peppery, crispy.  The eggs were cooked to perfection.  Hell, even the toast was interesting (thick cut sesame bread, buttered, yum).    So why didn't I give it 5 stars?  A) I left smelling like Auntie because we decided to eat inside and B) You're surrounded by douchey hipsters at all times.  Unfortunately, when not looking forlorn, homeless or pensive, they carry on conversations.  Ones you're forced to hear while trying to enjoy your pancakes.  *sigh* No place is perfect, but we'll definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"I left Aunties & Uncles feeling pretty underwhelmed after reading Yelp reviews and listening to recommendations from friends.  I arrived there at 10am on a Saturday morning. That's pretty damn early to need to wait for a table, when there were 2-3 totally free (and cleared off) yet a healthy gaggle of people waiting on the benches and chairs beyond the patio.   The host was on double-duty as a server, and when we asked about getting put on their wait list he seemed to bulldoze by without giving us much instruction beyond giving a hint that we should just join the herd outside and ignore our hungry stomach gurgles.  We wound up waiting about 15 minutes which, again, I find to be pretty ludicrous. But I digress.  I asked if their Tacos (made with Corn Tortillas according to their menu) was gluten-free since it's a heavily sandwich/pancake-dominated menu and I felt like getting more than bacon n' eggs. When I asked, our waiter gave a kind of doe-eyed/distracted blink, then said yes, so that's what I ordered.  Tasted great - worth the stomach ache later? Absolutely not. Wouldn't take their word on that again. Let this be a gentle warning to food allergy sufferers. I'll stick to the classic bacon/egg combo next time if I do go again. If.  Service was poor - we needed to nab our server to get a refill on our water. Where was the dedicated coffee server who meanders the halls, generously refilling our stained mugs to the brim, like in most of our brunch Toronto joints?  Two words about this place: Whomp whomp.  Aside from being allergic to what I thought I could order, food was otherwise OK - tasty hashbrowns but meh potato-salad. I think I'll just stick to my staple brunch houses: Lady Marmalade and Shanghai Cowgirl."}
{"text":"Last week was my vacation week and I had a whole list of restaurants I wanted to try.  But to my disappointment, most of the fine establishments were closed.  (What!? other people go on vacation too?!) Yes yes, I'm sure you can relate to how NOT understanding I was:P haha   To my delight though, Aunties and Uncles was still in full swing and my cousin and I made a day out of it with brunch starting here.  The first thing that I noticed was the line people waiting.  I did take Vivek's advice and ate a little before but the wait wasn't absurdly long (15-20min?)  We had about 3-4 groups in front of us.  Decor: This place is definitely going for the old school retro style.  Not CLEAN, retro like those 50's themed bars but more like a home in the 50s with random antique display items and tools.  Definitely a very homey feel and I'm sure older folk appreciate the ambiance tool.  Like some restos, you need to strategize your clothing attire.  This place will have you smelling like Aunties and Uncles all day. The kitchen is pretty much open concept.  Luckily, I was seated on the second floor so my clothes didn't absorb too much of the fumes.  Food: Everyone keeps on talking about the Breakfast Pocket so that was the obvious thing to order.  Boy did it deliver with it's flavor but let me emphasize that it ain't no pocket.  It's a sandwich because I don't recall the bread being like a pocket....or maybe the ingredients were so abundant that the pocket ripped into two (i'd believe it).  So if it was a pocket that simply exploded to become a sandwich, I'll call it a Breakfast \"Pockwich\".  So this Pockwich comes stuffed with scrambled eggs, peameal bacon, cheddar, and some other ingredients that slipped my mind with a side of hash browns, which I hoped were the crispy kind but just simply roasted stove-top potatoes kind of(boooooo too healthy!).  Me, being greedy, ordered a side of bacon which received praise from the waitress:P.  Bacon was crispy and decently thick. I even put a piece in my Pockwich to amplify the taste.  I did force my cousin to eat one though because I'm not a bottomless pit.  Oh the ketchup is home made and has a bit of kick to it! definitely try it out!  Service: Solid service. No complaints here.   Overall: A solid brunch joint but perhaps the ventilation could be improved.  Perhaps, the cutlery should not go along with the old school feel because it looked a bit dirty:P  And oh yea, don't trick me with the has browns:P haha It'd also be nice for the resto to post their standard menu on their website so people know what's available.  Then again, that's what yelp is for right?"}
{"text":"I would agree with \"mediocre at best\". Everything is prepared on a greasy flat top and is pretty heavy in taste and texture. It's a pretty standard \"diner breakfast\" with higher prices and an attempt to be dressier than it really is. I don't understand the lineup and I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We had brunch at Aunties and Uncles today, and we were surprised to see a long line up on a Tuesday afternoon. We waited about an half an hour before we got seated to our table. The waiters seemed busy and unfriendly. We had the breakfast pocket, breakfast tacos and the apple crisp pancakes, potato salad and home fries. The breakfast pocket was over powered with Dijon mustard and the onions were not caramelized like they were suppose to. It was eatable but nothing special. The potato salad was quite good. The breakfast tacos were terrible. The tacos them self were so old and stale that they had to serve the tacos with two taco shells on top of each other because they were breaking apart. The home fries were slightly burned, but eatable. The pancakes were the only dish we were happy about. At some point the waiter said that she is brewing more coffee and will be soon back to fill out our coffee cups, but she never did. The decor is funky but doesn't make up the lack of food quality.This is one of the most overrated restaurants in Toronto and would not recommend it to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Brilliant Breakfast Joint!  I have to say, if it was not for the raving reviews, I would never in a million years have entered this restaurant.  Because from the outside, it is basically a worn & tired hole in the wall.  The theme carries through to inside; it is basically an old home that was never ever renovated.    Right away though, you are reminded it is not just a house; the kitchen is located dead centre of the first floor and you can see and smell what is cooking the moment you walk in.  Even though the whole place looked a little tatty, I love open kitchens so right away I was more relaxed.  Boy oh boy, was the place ever packed.  And we arrived at lunch time!  The staff were all young and looked like downtown locals, but were very friendly and attentive.  There are seatings both on the first and the second floor.  Going up and down the staircase can be somewhat of a challenge, because it is steep and narrow.  There are also food servers buzzing through, so keep an eye out or you might wear someone's breakfast!  The place is decorated with articles, photos and magazines from the 50's.  The tables were from that ugly early 80s era (or pretty, depending on your tastes) which in the context worked out very nicely.  Let's talk about food.  Ooooh so delicious.  Since everything sounded so good, the four of us split up and ordered something different from the menu.  Waffles - Ooooh yeah.  Totally rocks.  Crispy outside, fluffy inside and probably Willy Wonka's favourite.  French Toast - Nice thick homemade slices, accompanied by poached pear and sprinkled with cinnamon and icing sugar.  Yummo.  Breakfast \"Pocket\" - A sandwich with scrambled eggs, peameal bacon, caramelized onions, garlic mayo and tomatoes.  The sidekick was a potato salad that was equally impressive, with dijon and dill notes.  Traditional Breakfast - Scrambled eggs, bacon and home fries.  Executed very nicely; the bacon was thick and crispy, eggs were ultra fluffy and the home fries were well seasoned.  This place really shames the popular chain breakfast restaurants.  It also sets itself apart from the typical drabby scene that makes you want to go back into bed; this place encourages you to wake up and go.  I am a fan for sure."}
{"text":"We love brunch, so when we popped by the atmosphere was very inviting and the food was completely satisfying. We had the Breakfast Pocket w/ home fries (incredibly filling), and the Cinnamon French Toast with poached bosc pear (Fantastic). The menu easily warrants another visit for us because there's just so much to try!! I was on the fence between the daily special of an omelette with spinach, kale and Swiss chard    The Coffee was tasty and the service was good, keep in mind it's cash only when you go. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Yes, people, it is as good as they say.   If you can get over the humility of standing in line for 40 minutes for eggs, the payoff is, for the most, part well worth it. This cramped establishment does their best to keep people flowing in and out and you can whittle the wait time away people watching/judging. Unfortunately, this place isn't particularly baby-friendly, as the hostess insisted that the party in front of us, complete with stroller, be seated upstairs. Understandably, the mother didn't feel comfortable leaving her stroller by the front door and had to ramble the thing up the narrow stairway. Like what? Not like you're busy taking care of an infant or anything!   Despite that gaffe, the rest of the experience is most enjoyable. There are lots of nostalgic knick-knacks around the place to the senses tingling, ready to burst with joy when our plates of perfectly cooked eggs arrive. Thrillingly, the toast is that challa that everyone can't stop talking about, and it's delicious. Be sure to ask for their delicious jam on the side (they don't bring it otherwise), which adds a fresh sweetness to the buttery bread.  All in all, enjoyable! If you can avoid going on weekends, I'm sure it would be all that, with a little less stress."}
{"text":"Classic classic classic. This place should be in a movie. It just looks so good. Prices are low. Quality is high. The decor is wonderful. It gets busy so be prepared to wait for a table. Worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favourite place to come for brunch in the city. Their specials are always great and you can never go wrong with a delectable breakfast pocket. I absolutely love their potato salad as well. Its a must try. Get it like I do, half mixed greens, half potato salad.  Take it from me, this place is worth the wait. Everytime."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled cheese - I had the Brie and Pear one and it was a rich mix of sweet and savoury (salty) that paired nicely with potato salad that had a more light taste."}
{"text":"The food isnt worth the horrible service.   Rude aggressive staff. Told us to wait outside in a -10 weather in a rude tone:\"you have to wait outside, okay? \" while he shoved me with his hands. Keep your hands to yourself.   We left at a heatbeat and we're never going back."}
{"text":"Rolling out of bed at 9:30 this morning, I realized we might actually be on time for the \"brunch window,\" that illusory ten-minute period between when brunchers with children leave and brunchers with hangovers show up, when line-ups disappear and breakfast eats are truly available on-demand. Alas I was mistaken, and we waited the prescribed 30-plus minutes for a table. Brunch al fresco is not an easy thing to find in this city.  (Pro Tip:  Get coffee before going for brunch. I pre-caffeinated at a nearby coffee shop, which made the wait bearable.)  I don't mind waiting outside for a seat, as long as I don't wait an unreasonably long time for food once I'm seated, and as long as the food lives up to expectations. Aunties and Uncles failed on both accounts today. The menu is still great, but the delivery fell short.  I love fresh grapefruit juice with brunch and was lucky enough to get the last glass before they ran out - at 11:30. My companion opted for coffee, which is quite good here if you're not too hip for drip.  We ordered.  And waited.  We had been seated for close to an hour before our food arrived. This was a significantly longer wait than the neighbouring party, who appear to have received \"rush order\" status after heading in from the patio to enquire about the timing of their meal. Great for them, although I suspect it held up our order even longer.  The food itself drew mixed reviews; my companion's take was more generous than my own. I had the western omelette of the day (ham, caramelized onions, havarti) and I chose a complementary side of potato salad as well as an extra side of peameal bacon for a double-shot of the Other White Meat. My companion went for scrambled eggs with a choice of three sides (greens, cottage cheese and bacon were hers), later declaring her appreciation of such a flexible menu offering.  I was less than thrilled with my omelette. The egg was thick and heavy with no integration of the ingredients.  The resultant presentation resembled something of a bulgy, overstuffed burrito. It tasted fine, but it's hard to make eggs, ham, cheese and onion taste bad no matter what you do to them. The potato salad side is a great offering for brunch, although I remember being much more excited about it on previous visits - this time around it was just fine. The peameal was fine too, although I would have expected a bit more of a serving than the two dainty slices I enjoyed.  My companion was happy with her meal. The scrambled eggs were chunky, just the way she likes them, the greens were substantial with a memorable dressing and the cottage cheese was as-ordered. She enjoyed the bacon, too, although she surrendered the undercooked, chewy bits to me.  All said, this was a disappointing experience.  Aunties and Uncles has a simple, limited menu (there are no fried or poached eggs on the regular menu, for example) for which a lot can be prepped in advance.  They should be able to deliver a high-quality product on a reasonable timeline.  This didn't happen for us.  Both NOW and BlogTO readers have recently chosen Aunties and Uncles as the best brunch in Toronto.  I'm not sure what to make of it.  Did they just have an off day?  Are they coasting on their reputation?  Or have the brunchers of Toronto just lowered their standards?"}
{"text":"I dont understand why the fuss??? its regular breakfast food in a small kitchy restaurant with depressing hipster music. I dont understand why anyone would put up with the absurd wait times here. food was okay, enjoyed the goat cheese and I think sweet potato could haven't been squash in my omellette. my husbands flank steak was decent but portion was small. part that really annoyed me is they only take cash. its 2014 ppl"}
{"text":"We went to Aunties and Uncles on a Wednesday morning. There was a 30 mins wait.  Ambience: (2.5/5) It is nice that they want to preserve their old school vibe, but the place could definitely do with a makeover.  Service: (3/5) Service could be better. Also, its 'Cash Only'!!!  Food: (4/5) We had scrambled eggs, toast, potato salad, Pan Bagnat with coffee. They have a simple brunch menu. Food is served home style, nothing fancy at all. It was reasonably priced for a good sized portion. When I was done, felt a little stuffed. Food was good.  Overall, good brunch place if you want to have homey food and if you don't mind the wait!"}
{"text":"Breakfast/Brunch: not normally my favourite meal of the day BUT when done incredibly well, I can make an exception.   Thursday, around 11:00, the wait was only about 10 minutes long. The one server in charge of the whole shebang was running the show excellently, remembering the order of everyone's arrival and seating them accordingly. The place is tiny and as adorable as the name itself. Patio season, get here already.   I ordered the breakfast pocket, minus bacon and my sister ordered the cinnamon French toast that came with poached pears. And so we shared! We were provided a transitional plate, very nice touch.  -The breakfast pocket was delish on foccacia bread, fresh tomato, cheese and scrambled eggs. But hello, forgotten caramelized onions! That's the best part! Made me sad.  -The hash browns were insane. SO good and herb-y. Confession: normally I dip my hash browns in maple syrup but the thought didn't even occur to me. They were great on their own! -The french toast was also lovely, as expected and a really generous portion. - Poached pairs: my new fave and went so well with the French toast and maple syrup.   All and all, it was a great experience that I'm glad I didn't have to wait hours to try. For the most part the service was awesome, despite the fact that our waiter kinda disliked my sister. Very nice to me though! Awkward but he was very understanding when I \"hit a wall\" with my abundance of food. If you can snag a table, do it."}
{"text":"I tried, I tried 3 or 4 times. But I just don't get the hype. Just look at the pictures here on yelp. It's pretty much bog-standard breakfast food without any inventiveness. The omelettes are pretty run of the mill, and even the vaunted 'breakfast pocket' is little more than a breakfast sandwich.   Maybe because it's relatively inexpensive? If you want no frills straightforward brunch, it'll serve you I suppose, I just like a little more inventiveness in this brunch-crazed city. I think the fame and lines is getting to the staff too - each time they seem weary and indifferent.   Maybe they too wonder what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"To me, this isn't so much a fancy brunch place as a really great breakfast joint. The menu is short and simple; the eggs are PERFECTLY cooked.  I bow before a cook who can consistenly make an omelette that's firm and yellow, not burnt-brown and falling apart. Aunties and Uncles does this every time. The only other place I know in town that does is Jacques Bistro, where the omelettes are twice the price (and, btw, worth it).  When I saw the croque monsieur, I thought it was just a pretentious way of saying grilled ham-and-cheese on challah. But when I tasted the subtle dijon, I understood. It makes the sandwich.  We've lost most of our old-fashioned diners (Stem, RIP). Aunties and Uncles is carrying on the tradition. Bravo!"}
{"text":"This sounds weird, but my favorite part of the entire meal was the ketchup. Their homemade ketchup is SO GOOD. I ate ALL of my hasbrowns (which were good too, but normally I take a few bites and push them aside) just so I could have something to dip in the ketchup.  We were lucky and somehow didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes for a table, though it was a rainy Thursday morning. The food took awhile, but the kitchen is very tiny, and we had coffee, so life was good. The breakfast food was decent. If I lived in the neighborhood, I think I would come here fairly often. The food was good, but not so outstanding that I would make a special trip for a repeat meal on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Went for brunch recently and the experience was pretty blah.  The coffee was weak and tasted more like hot water with milk and sugar; that wasn't a great start.  I had the banana oatmeal pancakes which were nice in theory but I had to kind of saw through them with my knife they were so tough.  Real maple syrup was a nice touch and the highlight of the meal (other than the company I was with).  The biggest downer of the experience was the server, who seemed pretty miffed that we were there.  I'm not sure if she was having a SUPER bad day, or is just generally surly, but she never offered us a refill on our coffee, took forever to take our order, never asked how anything was, sort of slammed the plates down on the table etc.  I'm going to chalk it up to something really bad happening in her personal life, but in my personal life when I'm out for brunch visiting with a loved one it's kind of a drag to feel like you're inconveniencing your server to get a single (over the course of an hour and a half - one refill) on our coffee.  I dared not ask for water.    Brunch is not a complicated food group; there are a lot of options in Toronto.  I doubt I'd ever go back."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 6.5/10 Food: 7/10 Atmosphere: 6.5/10  Service: 8/10  After hearing great things about this place, my expectations were pretty high. The Sunday afternoon wait was around 45 minutes (to be expected).   Overall, Aunties and Uncles feels lackluster; like it has lost what once made it great. The inside is very kitchy/has that cool diner feel, but I couldn't help feel that it was dirtier than it should be. I appreciate the quaint, but not when accompanied by a dusty feel (at one point, a long \"string\" of dust floated down in front of my friend's face!)  I had the brie/pear chutney sandwich. It was fine/good - the bread was great and I love brie so that was good. One of my friend's sandwich boasted sun dried tomatoes, but when the meal came they were just sliced ones. Was it the brunch rush that made them skip this or have they just not updated their menu?  THE BOTTOM LINE: you get the sense this place was once glorious, but as of right now, is not doing enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, simple decor, prices are fair, busy on weekends as others mentioned, breakfast cooking just like mom makes (yummy eggs, hash browns, french toast, pancakes), has a patio."}
{"text":"This place does not take reservations or phone numbers so you have to be mindful of the time the hostess tells you to come back for. We waited about forty minutes (which was fine because there are a lot of coffee shops close by where you can grab a drink). The decor was cozy and the table we sat at was large. The service was perfect, very nice waitress and the food came in a good amount of time. We had the coconut curry soup with peas and it was delicious. For our main dish, we had the Breakfast Tacos and Bagnat Sandwich. Both were good. The tacos were a little on the bland side and the sandwich tasted like a salad put into a sandwich (which was good of you like Greek salad).The bread for the sandwich was very fresh and tasted awesome. The homefries were excellent and so was the homemade ketchup. The potato salad was great - not just loaded with mayonnaise but had a lot of flavours in there. Overall great breakfast spot but maybe not worth a 40-minute wait in the cold."}
{"text":"There is a reason why there is always a line-up at Aunties & Uncles (A&U), it is because it is soooooo good!  I was here on a Sunday just before 10:30am and had to wait for about 15 minutes.  Get there early if you want to limit your waiting time.  I had their daily special omelet and it was fabulous - gooey, perfectly seasoned.  I loved loved their hash browns, which goes well their homemade ketchup.  They had a descent cup of joe.  I will definitely be back.   Remember payment is cash only!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, nice servers and cozy atmosphere! I really enjoyed that the fruit side wasn't the typical unripe cantaloupe most places serve. I will be going back so I can try more of their lovely menu!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while, yet I found the food experience, well, mediocre both times I went (pancakes, omelette). IMO Slightly bland food, interesting chic retro place, prices sorta OK if not cheap.  I'll probably go to Aunties & Uncles again to people-watch and try a few more things from their 'comfort food' menu. Not that I have a desire to go out of my way for this place, Bonjour Brioche is much closer and probably better, but if I were nearby Aunties I'd go again."}
{"text":"Delicious and sunny and happy! My favourite spot for breakfast / lunch! Cute little patio, adorable interior, friendly service. Amazing coffee. Breakfast pocket is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Vancouver and staying in the area. Went to grab coffee this morning and saw the line up and figured it must be good. Went back an hour later and still had a line up. It took about 30 minutes to get in. We were seated upstairs, on first glance of the menu it seemed pretty simple, simple can be good though. Ordered the scrambled eggs with bacon, toast and home fries. It was super basic, I mean basic basic.  It baffles me why people get so excited over what is super simple diner food in a place filled with second hand junk with food that's just fried and plated as is.  Our waitress, an Irish girl was pleasant but clearly stressed out by the large table near us who were quite rude and question everything on their bill.  I'd say jazz up the scrambled eggs, improve the bacon quality and buy better filter coffee and it'll be worth $15 a plate."}
{"text":"If you time it right, or at least dont mind waiting - this is (in my opinion) the best brunch spot in all of toronto.  The cinnamony coffee is always excellent, and a side of sweet potato hash is to die for. Service is fast and friendly, tables are small and space is at a premium but thats to be expected.  My favourite order is the breakfast pocket, Ive tried to recreate this at home, only to fail. Something about the caramelized onions and sweet/tangy mustard combo. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Its pretty big, and I usually end up with half as my lunch later in the day. Second favourite order is either the peach pancakes special or the french toast. Both come with boiled pear slices (just go with it) and real maple syrup.  Perfect music selections as well, and the walls offer enough oddities to keep you entertained while waiting for your noms. Or if you get a good table you can watch the kitchen make your food."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place, I had to go try it out. I had the breakfast tacos my partner has the bacon oatmeal pancakes. My tacos were ok. Not well flavoured and didn't inspire any 'wow' for sure. The oatmeal banana pancakes were good but I found the portion ( these are pancakes) were small. Latte was good, coffee not so. The wait for the food was long."}
{"text":"I love going to this brunch spot in summer. Getting a little breeze and banana pancakes on the patio. :) But you need to be there early to avoid the long line. Given by the capacity of their small kitchen, the waiting could be very long. I'd rather get up early, be there at 9 and watch all the people lining up for a patio table.. :)) I also recommend their breakfast pocket and breakfast taco. BTW, the price is really good."}
{"text":"I came here expecting a new diner experience and ended up with something that was not worth the trouble or the hype. :(  I had the breakfast burger (I know, odd choice right) and the roasted pepper thing tasted slightly off, and the whole burger was not what I was expecting, even with that fried egg.  I guess I should have stuck to a regular breakfast menu with eggs and bacon, but even what my friend got looked unappetizing.  I don't even want to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"This is the diner I was looking for when I was travelling across the country.  A place that time forgot.  A time traveler's dream.  Where the clock is literally stopped dead, and lying on its side.  Where the radios lining the wall haven't worked for decades.  Where the people have never heard of yelp (gasp).   We came for here for breakfast and I got the breakfast pocket, which was more of a breakfast sandwich.  The sandwich was pretty much what you'd expect, greasy, with much too much aoili, but otherwise pretty good.  The hash-browns had sweet potatoes mixed in, which gave it a bit of color and flavor.  The orange juice was freshly squeezed (at least we were told).  Overall, the meal was a bit too heavy (or hearty, depending on how you look at it) for me.   The conversations were lively and friendly, if that's what you're into.  A little back and forth between the cook and the customers to make the meal go down smoother.  (Is that a saying?)."}
{"text":"Don't want to wait?  Go on a Monday at 9:30 a.m.  It's not busy then!  Anyway, I liked the 50's kitchen vibe of this place, and the food is definitely a step above the regular diner fare we've been sampling for the last many months.  To be fair, this is a little more upscale than the places you'll find on my breakfast list (see link below), but if careful, you can still get brekky for under 10 bucks.  The scrambled eggs, though a bit on the skimpy side (2 small?  1 extra large?), were tasty, the potatoes were delicious and the multi-grain toast was very good.  The french toast looked great, and they offer real maple syrup.  The service was efficient if a little uninspired.  I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was just okay! We were lucky enough to only have to wait 15 minutes for a table for 2. I was satisfied with the food but didn't really like my dining experience. I feel like this place is way too small.  You'll leave smelling like food because of their open concept kitchen that doesn't have the best ventilation. I really hate that, so even though the food was satisfying I probably won't be back just because of that. It's really casual, so if you're in the neighbourhood and the wait isn't that long, you should definitely give it a try.  Oh and their homemade ketchup wasn't very good, but that may just be because I'm used to the Heinz garbage!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for brunch. This means an hour or so wait on the weekends, even when you put your name down at 10:15. You can easily wait at a cafe nearby, though you have to check back in at the time they tell you, and you might have to wait a bit more after that. Is it worth it? Definitely.  The food is great! We were sipping on warm apple cider while waiting for our orders, and that was fantastic. I ordered scrambled eggs with 3 sides: bagel, home fries, and peameal bacon. I also tried my friend's pears which seemed to have been boiled in syrup? Whatever they did to it, it was amazing. I tried their challah toast with jam: so good. And their home fries with house made ketchup is ridiculously yummy.  The decor is an eclectic mix of vintage signs, old model trains and the like. Lots of photo ops everywhere you look. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I visit this place on every trip up from Buffalo. Auntie and Uncles is by far my favorite Toronto breakfast spot. Yes, there will be a wait, and you will have to stand outside, but its worth the wait. The place is extremely small, kind of divey but I think its perfect! If feels like you're sitting in grandmas kitchen back in the 1940's. The waitress remembers us every time we come back, I have no idea how because we have only been there 3-4 times. She's great though and super friendly. The food is also very good, and cheap. We both had the breakfast sandwich special which was a sausage patty, fried egg, chipotle aioli, caramelized onions, cheese all on a toasted roll. YUM! It also comes with a side of there delicious home fries. This place is great, and continues to be on of my favorite brunch/breakfast places!"}
{"text":"Long wait times on weekends but great food and service. We had the chef's special. Try the home baked fries."}
{"text":"I was here 12 years ago and then I went again last year.  Although on the first visit the waitress was copping an attittude but if you look at it like \"hey everyone has a bad day\" then it will be OK.  Eggs, eggs and eggs and eggs and bread. Did I say this was a good place to go for eggs?  I loved the challah bread that they served with the omlette of the day.  People who travel from the east coast and other places will appreciate this place. A must for breakfast or brunch on a Sunday of you are in Toronto for a visit."}
{"text":"!!!!EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE!!!!!  Went here the other day with friends..had the stake burger which was great. Stake was cooked perfectly. I would've easily given this place a 5 star, but the servers we're just rude. I had no clue why and maybe we just happen to be unlucky to get these two but the chic was so snippy with my friend and when I asked for the bill at the end the guy that served us was just as catty. I asked to put my bill together with one of my friend...I didn't know how it works here but anyway he's like \"I'll bring ALL YOUR BILLS together!\" He could've easily told me he can't split the bill but he just snapped for no reason.   I do not like giving people bad reviews based on a single experience, Lord knows some of the staff here are fantastic...but this single experience just stuck out cuz it was just random.  I don't ask for much with my meal experience...bring the food and the bill at the end and am happy but they went out their way to be total A HOLES. Totally uncalled for."}
{"text":"Waited about 40 minutes outside in late winter at noon on Sunday. Had high expectations but staff was kind of rude. Breakfast burritos looked good on the menu but I could barely finish the soggy $9 worth. Left feeling not quite satisfied and overstuffed but a cheap meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"the breakfast pocket is amazing - I have no clue what else they serve because it's the only thing I've ever ordered.  The decor is charming and retro - but perhaps could use a little update (if not just a good scrub.)   Thank goodness for their summer patio because this place is small! Go early or prepare to stand in line."}
{"text":"Love love love. The potato salad is awesome. So far I've tried the breakfast pocket and the breakfast tacos and both left me feeling very satisfied. The sidewalk patio is great in the summer. Prices are reasonable, service has always been good and I've never had to wait for a table (both times I've gone at breakfast on a weekday). My waiter today was a riot."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. They don't acknowledge guests in line. There were 2 tables of 6 empty for the entire 20 minutes we waited,  8 people left and still the line was not acknowledged. Sad. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Visited this place on Yelpers' recommendations while in town on a Monday morning. (We had a little wait of 5 minutes before a table opened up, so I cannot comment on the long wait described in other reviews before sitting down).  I don't know why the overwhelming sentiment on Yelp, as well as the topic dominating most of the descriptions of this place is the fact that this apparently a 'hipster place' and you should 'wear plaid' or 'look like a homeless person' to 'fit in'. Seriously? Who cares? Maybe it's different in Chicago (home of arguably the best brunch places in the U.S.) but when I go to a breakfast/brunch place, I go there for some great BREAKFAST/BRUNCH/I-NEED-SOMETHING-TO-TAKE-THE-EDGE-OFF-OF-THIS-HEADACHE-FROM-THE-EVENTS-OF-LAST-NIGHT food. This isn't a bar where you meet people of a certain type, this is a food place. The focus should be on the FOOD.  As for the FOOD, this place is absolutely amazing. The Breakfast Tacos are a must have. The soft tortilla had the perfect amount of crispness, and the portion sizes were just right. Biting into the breakfast taco, the tortilla hangs around briefly before melting in your mouth before you taste the amazing, just spicy enough made-in-house chorizo that blends perfectly with the made-in-house sour cream. Wow.   With the side of freshly prepared hash browns/potatoes, there is a reason why people tend to flock to this place off the beaten path for some excellent food. The care and attention to detail in the delicately seasoned, perfectly crisped potato side accompanying the rest of the meal is an absolute delight, with, again, the perfect amount of crispness blended with a spice blend that adds a little extra kick to the dish.  Yes, the service can be a bit better, especially in such a small place with only so many people eating at a time, but the food overwhelmingly makes up for the lack of attention to your half-filled water glass or coffee mug. The attention is shown where it counts the most - in the food on your plate - and when I return to Toronto, this place will absolutely be on the list of places that must be experienced again."}
{"text":"The kitschy decor that looks like the antique roadshow and grandma's living room adds to the fun charm this small, quaint place offers. The food I also will say lives up to the expectation.  The breakfast is the perfect size in my opinion - not too large where you feel like you are shoveling back a small child, but not too small like a chi chi brunch. You choose your eggs, sides, meat, etc and they serve it up fresh and tasty. I got an egg omelette, bacon, potato hash and a side of fruit. I would probably have skipped the fruit and gone with a different extra since it was just pears in syrup. The hash is flavored amazingly, I'd honestly order just a plate of that if I could (MUST GET).  Be prepared to wait in line outside if you are going during brunch or breakfast (especially post-hangover sunday or saturday). It is worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Cramped, long lines and cold weather...minimal seating and a busy location. Somehow 'Aunties and Uncles' makes this recipe a huge success.   The interior is right out of the 50's, strange trinkets make for perfect conversation pieces and the food truly rocks. I've dined here once before, I remember it curing a hangover from hell and being impressive but I was super wowed today.   Great service, a grandma's kitchen stuck in time atmosphere and the much-loved refillable coffee will runnith over. God I love Canada.   Go for the specials, they taste fresh and are a little out of the ordinary for the breakfast hour. I dug into the havarti, cheddar, swiss macaroni with potatoes/sweet potato homefries and coleslaw. A side of braised pears satisfied the sweet tooth and food coma quickly ensued. Huge recommendation."}
{"text":"It's a solid breakfast place. It's less of a ~sunday brunch~ type of place and more of a great everyday diner type place. I come here on weekdays when it isn't super busy.   I love the ol' cozy vibe here. The food isn't particularly memorable, but the decor sure is!"}
{"text":"omg best brunch ever. The place is a total dive/whole in the wall. It has been moons snce I have been there but I remember getting the BLT on Challah(ironic i know) and it was amazing. This place always has a huge lineup"}
{"text":"SO AMAZING! I was skeptical at first, but as soon as I walked into the place, I was instantly charmed. The old-long drive-pit stop feel was to die for! The food was really unique, service was great and price was reasonable!! Would come back fro sure!! Took my partner here as a birthday brunch, and we loved it!"}
{"text":"?????????????? (????????????????????)??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????2??1????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"- this place is dirty good. - their breakfast pocket is simply amazing. scrambled eggs, cheddar, peameal bacon, dijon all packed into some killer bread. - my buddy had a pear and brie sandwich and said it was really really good. - homemade ketchup. come on. i like it. - there was about a 30 minute wait, but it was worth it.... however, any longer and i would label myself lazy for waiting in the cold because i didnt want to cook breakfast for myself. - word to the wise, go early. if you show up at noon on a sunday, you'll be waiting for a WHILE. - one last thing - you will also come home smelling like breakfast. their exhaust pipe splits off. one end pushes the exhaust outside, and one end back into the dining area."}
{"text":"Finally! A restaurant that understands that brunch isn't just for the weekends. A friend of mine in Toronto recommended this restaurant to me while I was in town on business. I met a business colleague here for brunch. It's a small, cozy and cute little place on a road that seems harder to find than I would have hoped for. But the locals clearly know this place, because both upstairs and downstairs were packed. We waited around 20 minutes for a table.  I started with a hot chocolate, which on this cold day, was a much needed insulator! It had great flavor, but wasn't too rich, which is usually my biggest complaint against some hot chocolates.  To eat, I ordered the breakfast tacos (eggs, chorizo, cheddar, cilantro) with \"hash browns\" and a side of cottage cheese. I loved the hash browns, but they weren't hash browns. They were much closer to home fries in how they were cut. But they had a great flavor and weren't greasy at all.  The tacos also were great! Now I LOVE chorizo, especially when it is spicy. I expected a little kick, but received none. This was a sweet chorizo, and it worked perfectly with the other ingredients. I added some of the house made sour cream, which was just perfect for it. And unlike most restaurants of this nature (small dining area, hipster crowd), the portion sizes were good too.  If I have extended trips to Toronto, I will make it a point to find time for a meal here."}
{"text":"I love the food at Aunties & Uncles.  The scrambled eggs and poached pears are truly delicious and I have enjoyed every morsel of food I have consumed from here.  Unfortunately you really need to time your visit in order to not wait in an endless line with a gaggle of hungry hipsters. I had the privy of once living on the other end of lippincott at harbord.  I miss those days. Strolling down to Aunties and sitting on the patio reading my school work  with the sun hitting my face and enjoying coffee, fresh oj, scrambled eggs, and poached pears. ahhh.   The décor on the interior of the restaurant is very kitsch and fun.  Seating capacity is limited in the off season-there is a decent sized patio for finer weather.  Service is decent depending on who you get. I am not one to single anyone out, however, there is one bearded server and I am not sure what his problem is.  The last few times I have gone into Aunties & Uncles he has been so terrible to my friends and I.  So, I would suggest going for breaky during the week and if you are going to brave the weekends, try going right when it opens.  I really do love some aspects of Aunties & Uncles.   Cash only establishment.  Prices are reasonable and within market value.   I highly recommend this food joint.  But make um understand its Westside foe life!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast downtown Toronto hands down!   After hitting this breakfast joint for the first time I was forever changed. Never had I had such simple yet not so simple breakfast that left me SO satisfied. From the outside, I never expected it to be as good as it was. The retro decor and ambiance of this little diner adds to the great experience of eating there. When I found A & U's ranked #1 in blogto's Top 10 Brunch I wasn't in the least bit surprised: http://www.blogto.com/toronto/the_best_brunch_in_toronto/   Whenever I'm blessed enough to hit A & U, I typically order either the breakfast burger or breakfast pocket, or one of each and split with someone (thx Saira). I have tried the banana pancakes, peach crisp pancakes, and French toast. Just ridiculous. The French toast is deliciously fluffy served alongside poached caramelized bosc pears and garnished with powdered sugar and syrup. Everything I've eaten there is bang-on. But let's talk Breakfast B's.   Breakfast Burger (subject to change at any time and a special):  The best version I experienced was on focaccia bread. The patty was so soft and fat oozing with homemade goodness. The type of patty that is so rustic and deformed falling apart and crumbling in your mouth. The focaccia is smeared with tomato sauce, an egg, and chevre cheese. My god, the chevre melts all over it as you eat. Solid portion as well.   Breakfast Pocket (subject to change at any time/signature dish):  Focaccia as well, stuffed with scrambled eggs, chorizo sausage, cheddar cheese and caramelized onions. (I'm taking a break from writing here for a few min. because I'm losing it recounting this)   Back...   The home fries look like chunky orange mashed potatoes and are cooked through. They truly are much better than most places like Wimpy's for example and their nonsense  1/2 cooked home fries. Still I do not order the A & U's home fries, I order the potato salad style potatoes. I call them the Dill & Dijon potatoes. It's a potato salad screaming dill, dijon, mustard seeds, butter and freshness. The sharp cool flavour is unreal, I definitely perma-fiend them.   The beauty of Aunties and Uncles is the simple menu. In my eyes a menu for a restaurant should always be small and changing from time to time with the exception of several signature (perfect) dishes. I have (subject to change at any time) up by the breakfast B's because I've gone before and the cheese has been swapped with Havarti, and the sausage with bacon etc etc.. That is because they purchase what they get and whatever they feel like that day. I love it.   This restaurant is only open Tuesdays to Sundays from 9am-3pm. In most cases a sign of an amazing restaurant (ie. Pizzeria Libretto). If you show up at A & U's Saturday morning you better be early, or be prepared to wait up to an hour. The best time to go is during the week at any time between 9-3. Have fun losing it at Toronto's best brunch venue."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about first there is nothing to choose off the menu. Service is very slow, staff unfriendly and I got food poising. Not recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"If your lucky you will arrive when the line up is short. The food is pretty good! I usually go a 4-6 times a year, as I work fairly close My colleague and usually order the same things... Club house sandwich and the girl cheese sandwich! Usually we leave beyond happy! Recently the lines and service has taken too long. Not worth the wait. If you have unlimited time for your lunch or brunch take a chance! It can be really delicious if you catch the chef on a good day! When we went last week, my club was a bit dry and my colleagues grill cheese hardly had any cheese... sad face. The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is that when we have gone in the past we've loved it! There are a few things that make this place wonderful: The salad greens Potato salad The homemade ketchup  The zainy interior design  And the fruit they add to the breakfasts  Plus you can order cottage cheese!"}
{"text":"I'm torn on this place. I've been a few times for brunch during the week and avoided the weekend rush. While I really enjoyed the food, the service was more than lacking. The male server that I have had on all of my visits left a lot to be desired. Getting a refill on coffee is near impossible and the one time we tried to get his attention to ask, he held up his hand as if to shush us. He spent more time playing with his phone instead of tending to customers, and when he did come to your table he looked annoyed to be there. While the food has brought me back a few more times, the lack of even basic customer service will probably stop me from going again."}
{"text":"If I could, I would eat at Auntie's and Uncles every morning. I went there yesterday (after a long hiatus from going there) and was still so impressed. We luckily got in before the rush and waited only a minimal amount of time.  My BF's father started reading the menu and asked \"where's the standards\", which the gentleman serving us promptly said \"you don't want standard\". ... which is quite suiting for this breakfast joint. While my BF and his father chowed down on the breakfast hamburger, I stuck with my favourite, the Pear, Walnut and brie sandwich. I crave this sandwich in my sleep. I haven't even mentioned my favourite part yet.... I love being able to watch two cute guys make my meal in front of me... there's not hiding in the back ... their Kitchen adds to the atmosphere of the venue.  One last thing... I hope they never change the music. It makes my dining experience that much better."}
{"text":"Their omelette of the day and cinnamon french toast is pretty darn stellar.  Pros: Reasonably priced, great food with good quantity, good vibes, \"homey\" feeling and patio.  Cons: Cash only, Wait times can be long (but worth it) and unpredictable for both getting seated and your food."}
{"text":"Family Time. Sunday Drivers. Morning Church Service.   Weekly Cleaning.   Brunch escapades.    All of the above topics have to do with taking it easy and chill-axing on a Sunday.  No stress and no work.    Brunch is a bit of an odd-ball. It's loud, bustling and the lineups can be a tad outrageous, especially when everyone wants to go to 'the best' brunch place around'.    Aunties and Uncles is no exception.    The service is quick and friendly but the spacing limited.    The menus are simple and straightforward but if you don't ask what the specials are, you might never find your perfect dish (mine is the Foccacia bread breakfast egg pocket).  The seats and tables are at least 25 years old but so are the park benches you find yourself sitting on for hours, reading the latest Atwood novel.    The food is fresh, tasty, and homemade.    Belgium waffles are to die for.   Eggs (whichever way you want them made) will cause you to reach a new level of egg-stacy (Yes, I actually said it).  With a few other greasy-spoon diners in the area, this one definitely has the least lingering amount of lard and the staff is uber-friendly!    Pay respect to all your forgotten relatives and visit Aunties and Uncles!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday afternoon and still had to wait for 10mins, but it was worth it! We had the breakfast pocket with home fries, bacon n egg with potato salad and greens, and banana oatmeal pancakes....everything was delicious, staff were friendly. Wish they have better coffee....why can't we have a place like this in our neighbourhood!?"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing brunch place, you will not be disappointed. There are pros and cons as every restaurant has but I think the quality of the food outweighs the cons by a long shot.  Pros: - THE FOOD! It's incredible! You can see them make every order in their open kitchen and they have a rotating menu of specials as well as a standard set of breakfast basics that they're perfected. Their home fries are amazing and come with homemade ketchup! I'd also recommend the peach pancakes if you're lucky enough to visit on a day when they're serving them. - The location: It's conveniently located on College St, a short walk from UofT campus or about a 10-15 minute walk from Queen's Park subway station - Food is really affordable, with most dishes coming under the $10 mark  Cons: - The wait for a seat on the weekends is pretty long, you're guaranteed to wait at least 40-60 minutes for a table. And you can't make a reservation either. - The decor and ambience isn't the greatest. The actual building seems like an old house that's been repurposed as a restaurant and the decor is very mismatch-y and \"run down\". Tables are placed very close together and can be cramped. Although once you get the food, you don't really focus on those things anymore. - The wait for the food also took a while after ordering. This is probably because the kitchen is quite small and it takes time to turn around so many orders at once. - They only take cash.  If you're an avid brunch connoisseur such as myself, I'd recommend checking out Aunties and Uncles at least once in your life for some amazing brunch food."}
{"text":"I love this place. So tiny and cute, doesn't seem to fit more than 10 tables if that. It has been at this same location for about 18 years which is incredible for any restaurant along the college strip which has a notorious turnover rate. That shows this is a classic. It is a very chill atmosphere, that being said don't go of your in a rush because service is amazing in the sense they take the time to speak to tables individually for awhile, however it can make it a legnthy dining experience. I love all the menue options- all great options for amazing pricing. This is definitely worth checking out when in this neck of the woods- it's one of my new fave breakfast joints without a doubt!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning, and it was truly enjoyable.  The food is all fresh and high quality.  The staff was friendly.  I had the banana oatmeal pancakes, she had the breakfast tacos.  Both were excellent choices.  I can understand why some might find service to be slow; they run a minimal staff who didn't seem to have any issues with service - but we are not the type to be in a hurry for things like this anyway."}
{"text":"Today's visit sparked some interesting debate about how to Yelp.  Each consumer \"consumes\" each experience differently - taking with it their own personal knowledge, background and perceptions.  With it, we all write Yelp reviews trying to best help other consumers understand our vantage point so they can pick and choose which information they absorb.  I really like Aunties & Uncles.  I am in the restaurant industry.  I understand it's extremely difficult to run a really small restaurant when it's always really busy.  They have two people in the kitchen, constantly making fresh from scratch food for everyone waiting.  And it's not a small menu - there are lots of options.  There are two wait staff, running around trying to refill waters, coffees, and service other needs.  Despite these set backs, A&U does something great - it serves great food, and good service.    But because of these set backs, it's a long wait for A&U.  I didn't mind the wait because they have seats outside for the sole purpose of waiting.  I felt like the guy manning the door knew whose turn was next. Then, once inside, you've got a long wait for food.  I didn't mind the wait because I could see the two people in the kitchen working their asses off - and everyone who came before us got served first, and everyone after us got served once we had our food.  The food itself is fresh and delicious, and the coffee is great.    The bathroom in the basement had a door that didn't close.  At all.  Despite numerous attempts.  This could be seen as a negative.  But when I told the waiter, and asked if there was another washroom, he let me use the upstairs washroom (perhaps a staff washroom?) and I appreciated that.  Again - some people might see having a customer washroom that was \"out of order\" as a negative, but I found a solution that met my needs.  If I'm not crazy hungry - this is where I want to be for brunch."}
{"text":"I went here for a late sunday brunch, at around 2 pm. There was a fifteen minute lineup. Not bad, it was a beautiful day.   Once inside I found the decor delightful. Old signs and books etc.   The service was sub-par. A little slow. Luckily the bookshelf I was seated next to filled the gaps with conversation starters.    I had the breakfast pocket. HUGE portion. 2 sandwiches. The pea meal bacon was not the best I've had but the eggs were scrambled to perfection with cheddar cheese.  Dijon mustard gave the breakfast sandwich so much flavour I didn't even put hot sauce on it.  The bill for 2 breakfast pockets and 2 ice teas was $25 and change. Very reasonable.  I recommend coming here later in the day as I did.  Had I come earlier and waited in a long line, this would have been a 3 star review."}
{"text":"The food is so good.  But the service? Leaves something to be desired, especially when you're there for bunch and all you want is a cup of coffee!   My fav: French toast. yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"I have had breakfast here maybe 4 times over the last few years. It's not bad. I'd never dare go here on a weekend however because the line is just INSANE. Many times I have attempted to go here for breakfast but due to the line up I end up eating at Nirvana or Sneaky Dee's (yes when I am that hungry I will end up at Sneaks).  I enjoy the decor and the fun flavours of the daily omlette but there is definately better breakfast out there (best breakfast in the city is a tie between Niagara Street Cafe and Lady Marmalade). This is however the best breakfast place in the College Bathurst area."}
{"text":"There were 6 groups ahead of us so we walked around the area for 30 minutes, we passed many empty restaurants with no wait but decided to go back to Aunties and Uncles.  To my surprise there were only, 7 or 8 sets of table seating 2 to 4. This place is small, no wonder the wait. But it was worth it, the food was sooo good! We had the Brie grilled sandwich and the Canadian cheese sandwich with yam tomato soup. Yummy! Hash browns were awesome too.  They have homemade ketchup. Who the heck has that. Maybe it was the long wait but the food was really good."}
{"text":"Down to earth and very hipster-like. This small restaurant which is located just around a corner is tight spaced with a bit of a wait. I'd say the wait was totally worth it though. The food is simple yet quite flavourful. Decor is cute, cozy and retro with wooden chairs which weren't the comfiest. I came here for a brunch with 4 other friends and overall experience was good. Only downfall I'd say would be the tight space.  Our waiter (looked like shaggy from scooby-doo) was quite friendly and checked up on us frequently to see if we needed anything else.  I will definitely be coming back to this cute retro area when I need time off to just simply relax and enjoy a savoury meal."}
{"text":"Divey atmosphere but charming and food is quality. We went on a Thursday just before noon for brunch and sat outside on the patio in front of the restaurant, there was a short line of people waiting to be seated after us- if you have a big group, you'll likely need to wait. There is an indoors too but it's small space overall. Also, cash only :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a sunny Wednesday afternoon, and thank god, did not have to wait for a table.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Club, which had real chicken breast, crispy bacon, fresh tomato and aioli on that delicious crusty challa bread.  It was an excellent sandwich!!! The side of potato salad was good, but could have done with more dill and less dijon, in my opinion. The homemade iced tea was dynamite!!! Perfect for a hot summer's day!"}
{"text":"Great ambience- homey + hipster.  Really yummy food- i got the Cinnamon French Toast with Bacon + apple cider and everything was great.  Good service- unpretentious and warm Reasonable prices  I'm sure it's crazy on the weekends, but it was perfect on a Monday afternoon and i was seated immediately- not even half full"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.  I don't understand why some people think this is the best brunch in Toronto.  Have they not eaten at Mildred's or Lady M?!  Don't get me wrong, the food was good - but the best, no.  Aunties & Uncles is like eating in your mom's kitchen in the '60s (or if you are from the shwa like me, the 80s).  Even the smells are the same.  But, it is not as good as mom's.  The menu is small, but they do have daily specials.  I opted for the scrambled eggs with challah toast, potato hash and greens.  I also had some mighty fine fresh squeezed orange juice.  The eggs were soft, supple and perfectly done.  The potato hash were to be a mix of regular and sweet potatoes with seasonings.  It was oily and tried to hard to be flavourful.  I also didn't like that when I was leaving I saw a few large tupperware-type containers with the potato hash just sitting in there.  It looked like compost.  The greens were fine, could have had a bit more seasoning as I think they had just been tossed with ok-quality olive oil.  The challah was amazing.  Perfectly toasted, sesame seed crusted and not too sweet.  Exactly how I like it.  The staff are quite laid back and friendly.  The decor, I guess I get it, but it could use a good cleaning, in my opinion.    I got to A&U just after 9 on a Sunday morning and had no problem getting a table.  Service was lightening speed quick.    Maybe if I hadn't heard such hype about this place it wouldn't have been such a let down.  I am also a fan of cleaner, prettier, stream lined decor (ala Mildreds), so the second hand stuff doesn't wow me.  I did like the encyclopedias that were on the shelf next to my table.  I don't remember the last time I saw encyclopedias!"}
{"text":"It's good if you're a poor hungry student  Lineups are long. Staff is rude. Food is okay. Enjoy."}
{"text":"So I had the omelette of the day. to be honest I don't really remember what was in it, but I think it was spinach, cheese, tomatoes and onions? It was great! nothing amazing but it was good.  but OMGGGG the potatoes that came on the side (they call them hash browns, which is stupid because it was not hash browns, it's just roasted potatoes) were A-MAZINGGG.  the next time i go back i will order whatever main im having and also a side of potatoes on the side for MYSELF.   They make their own ketchup which I know alot of ppl rave about too, I don't care for ketchup with my brunch so no comment there. Make sure to go early so u don't get caught waiting in line.  Also, the service is really really slow but I would still go back another time for the potatoes :)"}
{"text":"Tied for my favorite breakfast/brunch place during my vacation in Toronto. The side street location was pleasant for sitting on the patio. The downside to the patio is shared tables, where you get to listen to the adventures of a 20-something on their latest trip to Europe.   I really enjoyed the food. The breakfast tacos were great due to the bean/chorizo layer, but the eggs on top were just kind of there. I'm glad I took the advice of other Yelpers and had the potato salad for a side- delicious! I also really liked the daily pancakes my boyfriend got, though he found the plum topping too tart.   Overall a top notch place, and one I'd go back to if I had more time in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have known of this Aunties and Uncles for almost a decade and every time I have visited during the weekend, there is always a line.   In fact the record for me was about four years ago, one nice summer day, the line up was (and I literally counted 'cause I was curious) nineteen groups, couples, etc in line. That was ridiculous. So needless to say, my group of four did not wait... that time.   Now the food is really good, if you area talking from a greasy spoon and fillin' sort of way. Also the one thing this place has in spades is kitsch value... there is a certain retro vibe you  hardly ever see in other places... or perhaps at the odd whole in the wall on Queen West or Cabbage Town. Inviting, very cosy, very low-key and very unpretentious.    I have always enjoyed coming here although it is always hard to get in, but I seriously recommend it. Specially if you have never been here before. It is a nice experience, regardless of what you order *cough*eggsbenny*cough.*   Just remember, this place IS small, and thus the line-ups. So if you are going to come, either come hilariously early or border line closing time, however for the best experience, which is what I would recommend specially for first timers, then sorry, you are going to have to wait and bite the bullet.   Also remember, during the Summer the lineups seem to be less, but that is merely because they have a patio which basically doubles the seating space of the locale.   Seriously, Aunties & Uncles is an institution of both brunch and the hood it is at. Worth at least the one visit."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite brunch spot in Toronto! Yes, on weekends, you're gonna wait. Some of the wait staff are a bit unfriendly, but others make up for it. I get annoyed at people complaining about the restaurant in regards to wait time, since the volume of customers they get is not under their control. Its all about how they handle the situation and some deal better than others. (Fanny Chadwicks for instance fails at this.) in my experience, aunties and uncles has always been efficient in turning over tables and finding a way to get food out quick. Our server was friendly, our food was fantastic (oh my god, the breakfast burger) and so reasonably priced. It would be 5 stars, but another server was a tad rude and the whole cash only thing is a drag."}
{"text":"I had been really interested in this place but heard from numerous friends that it was overrated and filled with raging hipsters.  So, every time I scheduled brunch I avoided it based on the lineup that went out on to College on the weekends.  This past Friday I thought, YES, perfect timing for early brunch since I was off in the morning!  My friend got there early and I was scheduled to meet her at 11am.  She put out names on the list.  I was at College and Augusta when she called to say they refused to give her our table because I was not there yet.  She informed the server I lived in Kensington and would be there literally in 3 minutes.  The people behind her said, \"Please, seat her we don't care!\"  To which the server responded that was not allowed and when my friend tried to respond to that said \"Look, I'm not going to argue with you.\"  SO, we ate elsewhere.  Just because you have a tiny hole in the wall restaurant with minimal seating and people think its cool, does not give you the right to be so rude and disrespectful.  I've worked in retail, I know people can be jerks.  But I also know that my friend is not a jerk and this server was being obnoxious.  I will never eat here solely based on this experience and hope other people avoid this place and the hype."}
{"text":"Quirky service but great food give this diner a must have experience for brunch! Go with the potato salad as a side as other helpers have suggested. Breakfast tacos bit spicy for me but coffee & orange juice was fresh and blueberry pancakes that my hubby had were scrumptious! He didn't even want to share...lol!"}
{"text":"One of those super popular brunch places in Toronto on most people's bucket list however was disappointed with the overall experience when I came here with a gf on a Saturday afternoon.  Atmosphere: Very poor. Liked how there were benches outside on the patio. Didn't really find anything different from the way the restaurant was designed.   Price: Not bad. Most items are under $10 which is reasonably priced for a brunch menu.   Presentation: Pretty average. Food looked good but nothing over the top.  Taste: Excellent. Ordered scrambled eggs, fruit, ham and potato salad. Can't go wrong with scrambled eggs and fruit. Potato salad was excellent.  Portion: Good sized portion for me. I finished all of my food and didn't feel too over stuffed.   Service: Extremely poor. Waited 30 min for a table and staff were not friendly whatsoever. The food also arrived at a reasonably slow pace."}
{"text":"one sunny spring saturday morning we decided to go out for the best brunch in town. we did expect a line up.... we came prepared (well most of us) - we all had a mini breakfast at home.... we arrived at 1130am (well some of us later) and we were 4 at the beginning, 5 later and ended up being 6 (people were joining as we would text them that we're still in line and they still have time to join us) we waited in line almost for 2hrs.... started at 1130am... got a table just after 1pm.... did it worth it?...  well the food is great. I had a cup of gazpacho and sandwich with brie, pears and walnuts (delicious!). and the prices are super amazing (only paid $15 for all with tax and tip included) but man, the wait....  this place is a bit too small for the crowd that wants to get a seat in there. the patio only has 4 or 5 tables. and inside there are maybe 3-4 more small tables.  so I'm totally happy I came out and tried out this place but I'm not sure I'm ready to wait for my food for as long again...."}
{"text":"I can see why people might be quick to whip out \"HIPSTER!\" upon seeing the inside of this nice little restaurant, but I don't think that applies because everything about Aunties & Uncles feels sincere.  The waiter paid just the right amount of attention. The burger was filling as hell and had a pleasant homemade feeling kind of like the burger Eddie Murphy's mom made him in \"RAW\". There was no pressure to leave once my friend and I were done, despite some people waiting at the door.   Overall, I highly recommend this place and I know I'll be going back to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:  This place looks like your grandma's home with a creaky narrow staircase, 70s tables and chairs, and retro wall decor. There is always a line up here and for good reason. The little dish washing station in the middle of the dining space is a warm, homey touch. Next time, I might just show up in my PJs because it feels like you're eating comfy at home.  FOOD: It's got the best (Western) breakfast in town and the portions are huge. You can eat for under $10. For something a lil different try the Grilled Brie Cheese sandwich with pear chutney on amazing challah bread! The side order of potato salad with dill was so creamy!  CONS: They only take cash :("}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast/brunch/lunch gems around. It's a little tucked away, but any Toronto downtowner knows this as an excellent place to eat."}
{"text":"I went last weekend to have a chicken club and my girl ask for scramble eggs, the flavour was just perfect,  this time I taste such a love in every dish (everytime is always good of course). The pancakes was just perfect, toast outside and inside soft with the right balance of salt and sweetness of the banana.   Any minute I was waiting outside was worth it, I really feel like my grandma or. Auntie is cooking for me.  I would rate 6 if I can.   Ps : i love your Al green playlist"}
{"text":"This place gets rammed the moment they open, luckily I got a table but right after my coffee came so did the crowd.   To be honest there's better (I enjoy more of a  traditional style) breakfast joints that I rather go to but they do serve up from pretty unique items that's other places don't usually have, oh and the potato salad is out of this world. If you never here before I would recommend changing that because theyre busy EVERY SINGLE DAY, for a good reason.   The decor and restaurant is dated giving it a retro/hipster vibe, the employees are in street clothes so it's hard to flag down a server when everyone looks like customers lol.   Price is fair for the portion and location but in my personal opinion it could be better (refer to bracket above lol)"}
{"text":"Very good stuff. However the banana pancakes (2/5) were not good (to sweet) in my opinion. The cinnamon French Toast (4,5/5) and breakfast sandwich (4,5/5) with mashed potatos (4,5/5) on side were very awesome though. The Tacos get an ok (3/5)."}
{"text":"Last night I had a few too many PBR's at the Vampire Weekend show and was in need of some tasty vittles to soak up all the awfulness.  So donned my mostly clean Marcel Marceau wife beater and headed to my favourite haunt, Aunties and Uncles.  My GOD I just love this place!  I feel right at home with the retro tables and chairs.  Also, I used most of my rent money this week to buy a totally deck scarf at Urban Outfitters so I really appreciate the prices here.  Super cheap.  The waiter dude was kind of a dick to me, but I think that's cool.  I like completely stupid shit that doesn't make any sense - like wearing glasses when I have perfect 20/10 vision.  I also had a really difficult time getting the a refill on my coffee. And the check.  I'm assuming he was just being ironic.  Kick ass."}
{"text":"Really, who doesn't love home-style brunch food? Thank God for Yelp as I found this place on the fly in Toronto and it was really worth the walk over. There was about a 15-minute wait for the two of us, but again, worth sitting outside for.   The menu at Auntie's & Uncle's offers a somewhat eclectic home-style assortment of sandwiches, breakfast foods, burgers, etc. I had the omelet special, which had tomatoes, leeks and cheese and came with this delicious sweet potato-potato hash and excellent challah toast - Another place where portions are enormous! My friend had the breakfast burger (basically a burger with a fried egg on it) and that looked great too.  The service was really friendly and fast, and the place itself is adorable with kitschy retro decorations, a mish-mash of your grandmother's furniture and an overall fun vibe. The prices were excellent (I think my omelet was something like $7.00) and overall, this is a highly recommended breakfast or brunch spot. I look forward to coming back in the summertime when the weather is nice and we can sit outside."}
{"text":"After giving up many times due to the wait time, I finally went!  This brunch joint is no doubt POPULAR.  I went during the G20 summit and it was raining so it cut down the waiting time to 15 minutes... perfect plan.  I don't remember what they had, apparently the menu changes quite frequently.  I had a nice breakfast sandwich of some sort with Challah bread, which was delicious.  I had a side of honey ham, DEE-LICIOUS.  It was all so so delicious.  Tip:  - If you go, plan to wait.  That's just the name of the game - If you sit inside, you will smell like Aunties and Uncles all day  Overall, a worthy experience if you have the patience, once you get in, you will experience a nice greesy home-cooked meal that will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I dont get what the hype is about. Besides pasta, I consider breakfast one of the easiest meals to make. Bread, eggs, potatoes, people have been practicing cooking these things for centuries so you'd think they have become pretty hard to mess up, yes? I had gone twice before on a weekend to Aunties and the wait was approx 45 mins each time. Finally went on a weekday when it was dead and were immediately sat. I ordered the breakfast pocket and they made a big deal about subtracting the peameal bacon. My friend ordered the chicken club and both were less than mediocre upon first bite. The food got more nauseating the more we ate, and the \"hash browns\" had a sour taste to them. Potatoes - my brother who thinks processed cheese is a food group can make potatoes.  People have lived off these staple items since dinosaurs I don't understand potato inconsistencies. Both of us had that weird feeling where you're still hungry but feel like projectile vomiting everywhere after eating here. If you like feeling that you have the stomach flu, check it out."}
{"text":"My favourite meal to go out for is breakfast/brunch. We went to A&U when it first opened but did not go back until two years ago when it  became one of my regular places.  This happened because I ordered the waffles.  I could happily eat these every day.  Unfortunately the waffle iron has been broken for the last couple of months.  I will be happy to give more stars when the parts arrive and the waffle iron has been fixed.   Best not to go when you are very hungry as the wait can be quite lengthy. As it is an open kitchen, I find my clothing smells of what has been cooked."}
{"text":"Funky, hip, and trendy are apt descriptions of Aunties & Uncles. Based on the 4.5 star average review I get my buddies to walk 2 miles Friday morning right after we checked in our hotel. I hoped it would be worth it.  We actually walked past it. The side street it's on is fairly residential is only one of two businesses on this part of the street. With a picket fence and a laid back atmosphere, seating can be a wait since a table for six may have two people seated there. It's apparent that there are many regulars with waitstaff greeting some by first name. There is also many families, I'm guessing those who live in the neighborhood. The decor on the inside reminds me of home basements that are used for the kids' playroom, and with the formica tables the era is the 1950's.  The choices weren't expansive but enough. I enjoyed my croque monsieur with the potato and sweet potato hash. My friends had the steak sandwich and the breakfast taco. They found the steak sandwich to be good, but appeared to be luke warm at best. The breakfast taco was fine, but would have enjoyed a larger portion. I think the problem we found was that the waistaff was not as attentive as they could have been. I believe this is due to them being used to having so many repeat customers and people not being in a rush to eat and go. So I'm not surprised why there would be long waits on weekends. It's not a huge place and people like to hangout there. So if you're hungry make sure to get there early and take public transportation."}
{"text":"It's like I died and went to heaven and breakfast was being served. This place is an absolute dream. I love the banana pancakes, sandwiched between the pancakes are bananas and oatmeal.  The food here is honest and non-fussy delicious and the atmosphere is just great, like you walked into a friends house for brunch."}
{"text":"\"I thought love was only true in fairy tales Meant for someone else but not for me. Love was out to get me  That's the way it seemed. Disappointment haunted all my dreams.  Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer Not a trace of doubt in my mind. I'm in love, I'm a believer! I couldn't leave her if I tried\"  Thinking of Aunties & Uncles, reminds me of songs from the 1960s rock pop group Monkees. Perhaps it's the kitsch adorned walls, the hipster vibes and threads or the greasy home cooking that reminds me of a time when butter was never second guessed. Butter should never be second guessed.  It's almost impossible to get into Aunties & Uncles without a wait. If you want to skip the line all together, you'll need to skip a night of drinking or camp out after bar crawling to get to the front of the line by 10:00am. If you get there by 11:00am you'll be dealing with a small crowd but should be in no later then 25 minutes. Once in, you already can sense why its worth the wait.  Highlights: 1. Great ambiance and lots to look at. They've done a great job at collecting some precious articles from decades ago. There's a few questionable items but all in all it works together.  2. Always the same chefs in the small open concept kitchen. If you get a chance, try to watch them at work. It's like a rhythmic food trance.  3. Food is wickedly buttery and amazing. The sammie is something else. A sumptuous buttery onion bun, packed with greasy eggs, tomato, mayo and avocado. (subbed it for bacon). 4. Affordable. A lot of brunch places are offering eggs for $12 + which I think can be a pretty big rip off. For two you can walk away with a $30 bill. That's with drinks as well.   When I'm feeling like a greasy breakfast of high quality goodness I instantly think of making a hop over to A & U...sometimes you get in, sometimes you don't, but it's worth the try."}
{"text":"Small and cozy, a little crowded, but the BEST banana oatmeal pancakes! Srsly, eat the pancakes... Breakfast pockets also good, fresh squeezed juice, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Really delicious brunch here! The wait was a bit long, but it was what they estimated so we couldn't complain. The grilled cheese was fabulous, as was the tomato soup (soup of the day) and the banana pancakes. Another friend had one of the breakfast sandwiches and loved it! The potato salad was A++ and I wish I had gotten some to go! Will definitely return next time I am in Toronto!  It is cash only and pretty small, so not great for a big group. But grab another friend or two and do yourself a favor and fill your stomachs here!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Berkeley and love the ambiance here, nice old school vibe and super friendly waitress. Ordered a veggie omelette with bacon on the side, with a salad.   Super fresh and came out fast. Had a great conversation with my friend Neil and loved the experience here. A must visit brunch place in toronto, one of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"I think I was a bit harsh on Aunties and Uncles the first time around. It really is an A-OK breakfast spot. Last time I was in, I shared their daily omelet and peach pancakes with my friend. Both were really, really great. The service was a tad on the slow side but the peach pancakes definitely made up for it.   I won't go out of my way to go to Aunties and Uncles, but it IS a good spot to go to when invited.   Cash only fyi."}
{"text":"On a rainy Sunday morning, Aunties and Uncles reminded me of having a heavy brunch back at home... but not at home.  Reality sets in and reminds me of my laziness to prepare my own breakfast. Alas, this was a great experience so it turned out to be well worth the 4 minute walk I took from my home.  As I said before, it was a rainy day. As per Sunday ritual, instead of church I headed to a new brunch destination. This time a place I've passed by countless times, unknowing of what it was or why crowds waited outside every Sunday.  Auntie and Uncles is a cozy and small restaurant with 2 floors. It had the layout of a house with old kitchen tables and busted chairs, childhood pictures hung on the walls, and other old memorabilia from the early 1990s. It was way-back play back to put it simply.   After a few minutes of waiting, we were ushered to the 2nd floor which was a small room with 7 tables. All seats were occupied of course.  The menu was short and offered scrambled eggs as the only egg preparation. Naturally I wanted meat with my brunch, so I opted out for the Breakfast Pocket.  Warm and soft focaccia bread filled with caramelized onions, American cheddar, scrambled eggs, tomato, pemeal bacon, with dijon mustard and aioli as spreads. It was really good, something I would want to eat everyday if it were 0 calories and 0 fat. The best part of the meal was the hashbrown sides. A combination of sweet and regular potatoes fried on the skillet. These hasbrowns aren't crispy and oily but rather steamed-like and not greasy. Still really good, considering that I am a sucker for fried potatoes.  My girlfriend had the Breakfast tacos with the same sides. Delicious as well. Her favourite part was the cilantro sour cream. I think the cilantro had nothing to do with the generous slathers of the stuff on her two tacos. I thought they were good, she thought my sandwich was better.  Overall, Aunties and Uncles offers a unique dining environment that reminded me of home despite the fact that I'm Asian... The food is good and the prices are reasonable. However, both my gf and I agreed that we weren't coming back anytime soon. I guess it just wasn't special enough. After all, we felt like we were eating in someone's kitchen minus the family conversation. It's cute and hipster-ish, but not great. Staying in and making breakfast instead wouldn't have been a bad substitute that day."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere. Food is good for the price and location is decent as well. Service is a tad bit slow .. and will definetely not recommend a party of more than 4 to go as you'll be there for a long wait as the space is tight."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. I had the banana oat pancakes and my bf had the breakfast pocket, and we both had a warm apple cider after a long (and cold!) wait outside. My pancakes were the BEST I've had in Toronto - I also really appreciated having actual maple syrup instead of the typical cheap \"table syrup.\" My bf's meal was ok - they subbed a different kind of bread for the focaccia, without telling him - disappointing. We did raise the issue of the food substitution with our server, who was polite, but did not offer any remedy. If it weren't for the surprise food substitution and hour-long wait, I would have rated 5 stars. Will be back but perhaps not super soon."}
{"text":"I am going to briefly write about a couple of the few spots from the Toronto trip.  First of all, Philadelphia has a superb restaurant scene.  While I truly believe that Jonny, Tim and I hit up the best brunch spot in the city (at least top three), I rattled off a half dozen from my hometown that topped it.    So Sunday morning in Toronto we roll up to Auntie and Uncles.  At 10am we had to wait about 25 minutes for an outdoor table, which wasn't bad at all.  The decor on the place totally rocks.  It's a tiny spot, and most of the tables are outside.  There's an awing that can extend to cover the whole dining area, which is great.  Inside is decorated with cool, old kitchen and home antiques.  All the food was cooked in an open kitchen right in the middle of the joint.  Everything about this place was cool.    Our servers were very nice and mostly attentive.  The menu was pretty small, but everything looked great, and no one minded.  There were also a few specials for the day.  I really could have ordered a few things off the menu and been happy with my choice.  We all put our orders in and enjoyed the perfect weather.  I had the breakfast burger, which was delicious, from the bread and meat to all of the toppings.  Best part was the potato salad that came on the side.  I'm not sure how they make it, but it's super.  All of the food here was delicious (I tired Tim's fish tacos as well) and the portions were perfect.  The best part might have been the price.  Compared to what we normally pay in Philly, this place was cheap! $35 brunch for three with coffee and a nice tip?  You bet.  If you're in Toronto, I recommend making the trip out to this great little spot."}
{"text":"yay!! my first yelp.ca review! i love it - the five stars is for the food, atmosphere, the name... i hate waiting, so i would most likely skip weekends, i love going weekdays! but the last time i was in town, my only chance to go was on a monday - the day they are closed! :("}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I did really love it. Service was a bit weird though, our waitress wasn't very communicative! However, my croque monsieur was excellent. It feels like you're having breakfast in someone's living room in the 1960's. Super kitsch."}
{"text":"Disappointing from start to finish.  We went to Aunties and Uncles after reading their positive Yelp reviews.  We should have listened to the negative reviews as they were much more accurate.  The food was inconsistent.  Home fries and oatmeal banana pancakes were very good.  Omelet was runny and the regular pancakes were under cooked and had to be sent back.    What really ruined our meal was the service.  We went on a Tuesday morning and the restaurant was almost empty.  My wife's and my breakfast were delivered within a reasonable time, but my son's pancakes came out a full 12 minutes later and then were still undercooked.  Nothing worse than waiting for an extended period for one person in your party to receive their food.  The waitress apologized, but did nothing to compensate us for our ruined breakfast.  It was obvious the cook had not made the pancakes until we had asked where they were, but the waitress just said they take a while to cook.  Come on, if you can't deliver three meals at the same time when your restaurant is very quiet then you shouldn't be in business.  I nicely told the waitress that we had come only because of their Yelp reviews and that they had not lived up to them.  I also suggested that she should not charge us for the pancakes that were delivered so late.  She did nothing.  Don't waste your time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here today after reading about it being the best brunch in town. The waitresses were very unenthused and attempted to spend as little time as possible with you. I got the omelette of the day which had asparagus, red pepper, onions and Gouda cheese. It was definitely yummy but I wouldn't say it was the best omelette I've had. The home fries were really yummy crispy and full of Rosemary. Idk if I would agree it's worth the wait. I think it's a little over rated but still a good solid brunch."}
{"text":"The breakfast tacos were delicious along with the potato salad...  Cash only spot was the only con here"}
{"text":"While waiting for a friend to join us, my friend and I looked in front of us at a line up of approximately 15 ppl or so half of which were holding a neighbourhood coffee shop's COFFEE.   A warm drink on a COOL March day was probably a good idea while we waited 45 minutes before we even got into the crawlspace that fits approx. 4 ppl just inside the door where they can fit the next group in line to warm up prior to getting seated for their meal.   It's almost CRUEL when you're one of the few that stands inside while watching the other 20+ ppl freeze outside.  Remember the scene from Titanic when everyone drowns in the frozen ocean?  One of those moments when you can't do a thing but you know you had to help others or else you'll have the memories of regret for the rest of your life.  While walking towards a rickety stairway a la haunted house, I got a glimpse of the tiny kitchen no bigger than a condo kitchen area. Assigned a tight space upstairs we sat feeling like SHAQ in a VW beetle.   A browse of the menu revealed mostly Ciabatta style breakfasts that looked like it contains many unorthodox ingredients unlike Mel's Diner style breakfast places (R.I.P).   The Ciabatta was tasty knowing that it contained such things as Eggs, Pea-meal Bacon, etc... It's pretty hard to make that combination of ingredients taste BAD and I guess they priced it reasonably in that neighbourhood.   I don't know WHY I asked for the Salad as my side. It's not like I eat Salad as my Cereal in the morning. After eating such a Savoury flavoured breakfast sandwich, the Greenery just took all those tasty memories away. I'll try for the other sides next time.   After freezing my Aunties&Uncles out there on the street and starving, any food and drink would have been good for me. If I didn't freeze out there, maybe I can have better taste-buds to rate this place fairly."}
{"text":"Situated near the university, it's more of a home remodeled into this cool homey breakfast joint (the upstairs restroom includes a space where the tub was!). You enter from the front area where there is outdoor covered seating (great on nice sunny days). There's seating inside on the first and second floor with a lot of random knick knacks on the walls. Ordering-wise, you have to get the Cinnamon French Toast! You won't go wrong there and you definitely won't leave Aunties & Uncles feeling hungry. The slices are huge, sprinkled with powdered sugar and maple syrup on the side. The fresh fruit rounds out the meal. We came on a Monday morning around 11 am, so we got seated right away. I'm sure weekends are more packed. Parking will be a challenge so nab any street parking while you can!"}
{"text":"Finally found the time to visit this popular brunch joint. This place is definitely busy, though I only waited for 15 minutes on a Sunday at 11am, the line quickly grew as we sat and waited for our food. The wait for the food took foreverrrrrr, much longer than the wait for the seats.  I ordered the chicken sandwich with the home fries, it was good but I wouldn't say it's the \"#1 brunch place in Toronto\". I think Toronto has a lot of other great choices to choose from with a shorter wait time and better food."}
{"text":"The sandwich special with sausage, havarti, and caramelized onions was awesome! My partner had the breakfast hamburger (a burger with an egg on top). We agreed both were pretty filling. The home fries were awesome.  Service was friendly, though the wait for two fairly simple sandwiches was a little long (at least ten minutes). Cash only.  The selection is also pretty limited, though this may either be because we went on a weekday, or it's a good thing they specialize in a few simple dishes.  I would probably go again, on a weekend to see if the menu is a bit bigger!"}
{"text":"Pretty plain breakfast food. Nothing excellent but nothing terrible either. Kind of expensive for breakfast."}
{"text":"THE brunching spot in Toronto (to date)!   For an intimate fun setting and an appetizing menu, this is the spot to go!  Think: modern 1930's diner fun! The sunny yellow walls brighten up the space, juxtaposed with dark rustic wooden accents, and decorated throughout with frames of poppy coloured classic poster ads. I instantly smiled when I saw the menus! How cute! Bright tangy orange with comic-like fonts.   The kitchen is the centre hub of the space, with smaller rooms to each side. We lucked out with the corner table in the back of the one of the rooms, overlooking the entire restaurant! Best photo spot!   THE FOOD The three of us ordered the omelette of the day, spinach, mushrooms, and cheese. I was immediately sold on the mention of \"cheese\".  The omlette was stuffed with creamy spinach and oozing with melted white cheese, stringy & chewy just the way I like it! It comes with a choice of 3 sides (mixed fruit salad, hash browns, or greens). The bread, oh the bread! It was soft and buttery heaven! When we bit into it, the three of us had a simultaneous moment of silence.  As an I occasional cafe drinker, I ordered a latte, but found it too bitter. I asked for an extra dose of steamed milk to cream it up, but that didn't seem to have any effect. Sadly, it became an abandoned cup of joe.   THE ATMOSPHERE Brightly lit, tall ceilings, narrow aisles! The seating space felt a bit tight. I'm on the petite side (5'2 and 111 pounds) yet my seat touched the person behind me. So if you are bigger or taller, or simply like a little more elbow room, sit in the aisle seat.   THE SERVICE Service was quick, but not sure if we were missing anything. The waitress said the condiments on the table were jam and ketchup, but, although they looked different, my friends said both tasted like berries. Hash browns with jam, not recommended.   THE PRICE RANGE We each had an omelette and 1 breakfast drink and split the bill three-ways. $15 per person with tax and 20% gratuities! I'm not complaining!    TIP: Lineups galore! Be prepared! Don't come too hungry! We came on a Sunday, arrived at 10:00am, and waited 20-25 minutes.   GET THERE Convenient to get to, and easy to spot. By TTC, get off at Queen's Park Station, take the Westbound (506 High Park) and get off at Bathurst Street. Walk back (East)(opposite direction of TTC) about 20 steps and make a left @ Lippincott St. You can't miss the colourful exterior!   Coming back here? Hell-to-the-YEAH!"}
{"text":"This  place is SOOO cute with decor of mismatched plates, chairs and cutlery.  Food is great! But get there early because there can be a long wait!  One of my favorite brunch spots in the city!"}
{"text":"we came here for lunch around 1pm on a Monday but the small cozy breakfast diner was full. the wait was short even though there were two groups before us and the place only had ten or so tables.  the decorations were retro, reminiscent of the 60s, with old advertisements, signs, and paraphenlia from that decade.  it had a really homey and comfortable feel (:  the menu was simple yet unique.  cinnamon french toast, pancakes, and belgian waffles for the sweet dishes, and a variety of sandwiches with hash browns or salad for those craving a savory meal.  we ordered the cinnamon french toast and breakfast pocket.  the cinnamon french toast was served with cinnamon poached pears.  the french toast was not overly sweet and a tad bland without syrup.  it was made really well and had a good texture.  it was a good match with the pears but overall just an okay dish.  the breakfast pocket on the other hand tasted amazing.  the foccacia bread was crunchy and fresh.  it was so good i ate it on its own.  the rest of the pocket (cheese, caramelized onions, peameal, scrambled eggs, etc) was equally amazing, a perfect amount of saltiness and moistness from the melted cheese, melted onions, and aioli sauce.  the pocket was well made and i would definitely come back to order this!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch place in the whole world.   The eggs are creamy and that hint of milk really makes it that much more filling. The toast is also milky. What butter do they use because I need it! Their bacon tastes like breakfast sausages but feels like bacon. And their home fries? Omg, stellar.   But wait. Their ketchup is legitimate tomato sauce. It's probably the French's brand but I love that it's more tomato based and less of the \"let's see how sour we can marinate this tomato\".   What I super love about this delectable gem in Toronto is their decor! Yeah it's tiny bit it's a huge throwback to the 60s. Almost all their chairs are different and they never match. It's got moxie.   And I really love their cute little half tables by the wall. Yea I can't fit more than 2 plates but it isn't really a place for parties anyway. Their food is absolutely amazing.   Also, free coffee refills. An essential part of every brunch.   I need to live here."}
{"text":"hubby's been talking about this place forever... so on this sunny saturday we wandered to aunties and uncles.   first off, line up takes forever. we waited about 30 min for a seat and there were only 3 couples before us. there's quite a few seats but it seems that the servers are in no hurry to maximize occupancy or customer flow. a little infuriating when ur standing in line and hungry but quite nice because you don't feel rushed or squished with people you dont know. i guess the best thing is to get there early.  i got the breakfast pocket, hubby got breakfast taco. both were quite good. hashbrown is a decent side to get as well. it is A LOT of food, i ate all of it and felt so gross afterwards. it's definitely on the greasy side and if go when you're hungry.   coffee was okay, kind of weak. staff's pretty chill about everything, kinda of interesting.   cool decor over all. will come again, maybe."}
{"text":"The food is great, it's well priced and the service is nice. The side salad, potato salad and home fries are all great. There's really nothing short of perfection here, once you sit down and are ready to order.   The only problem is how long it takes until you get to sit down and order. On a weekend, be prepared to wait up to (and sometimes longer than) an hour. Waiting that long for breakfast just isn't worth it. There's always a line and that takes aunties and uncles from 5 stars to 4 stars for me. I know it's not their fault, but it's part of the experience that. If you don't mind waiting, or there happens to be no line. This place is one of the best breakfast options there is."}
{"text":"This place is *okay*. Unlike what the huge line up outside suggests I definitely don't think of it as amazing.   The good: - the prices (the 'how' for the line up) - the outdoor seating - the menu variety  The bad: - the line up  - the service (it's hella slow) - the food:  well, it's not terrible per se, but it's certainly not good either.  missing so much flavour and creativity it's incredible.   The lowdown: If you're looking for a cheap and hearty brunch in the downtown core and you have an hour to kill waiting in a line up and another 30 to wait before receiving your meal and some hella awful service this place is your jam."}
{"text":"Long wait. Very small place. Very good food. Get the breakfast pocket. Very hipster place full of college kids, so after a long night of drinking this is a definite place to come cure a hang over. Oh yes and how could I forget the 80's music in the background :-)"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is so popular.  I was sat at a dirty table, and everything surrounding me looked unclean.  There were flies buzzing around the entire place. Our waiter, who was rather apathetic and had a snobby attitude, kept asking me if I was ready. He was really rude and rushed me and my wife and in the end my wife ended up not ordering because she felt too rushed. I ordered a burger and it was dripping with grease. It was disgusting. The waiter was just goofing off with his friends instead of being attentive to his tables. Their art on the walls have dust on them.... maybe they should think about cleaning instead of talking with their friends. They think that they are cool because they have school chairs( which they probably stole from King Eddie next door) for their seats, but they are not cool, they are uncomfortable and remind me of a sad time when I was bullied at school and always sent to the principles office.. I do not need to be reminded of this time during what should be a nice brunch with my wife. Aunties & Uncles? More like Sad and Depressing!"}
{"text":"A lot of hype about this place which is mostly warranted. It has got a quaint hipster feel with a solid repertoire of brunch fare. My friend had the breakfast pocket - cheddar, peameal bacon, garlic aioli and egg...solid. My scrambled eggs, bacon (just the right crispyness) and challah toast were hearty and above average.   The wait can be killer. Got there just after the first rush and had many people staring us down to leave as the mid day sun started beating down on them. Is it worth the wait...hmmm. Still, the food was as high quality as the Senator (my other go-to brunch place) and the outdoor \"shaded\" seats were enjoyable.   I'd go again for sure if it wasn't past 10:30 on arrival."}
{"text":"I like this place for brunch but my only problem is that I usually never get a seat before half an hour, so I've started avoiding them.   But awesome food, great ambiance and really good service. If you haven't been there - you should try this place once at least - it's amongst the best brunch places in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with some friends on, I believe, a saturday.  The burger special (which I had bun-less of course) was not bad.  The fried egg, brie, and roasted red pepper toppings made up for the somewhat dry patty.  Though the brie was quite mild (i.e. bland).  The french toast was also so-so.  I think the ideal french toast should be made of  thick bread slices rather than thin, and fried to the point that the toast is slightly crisp around the edges, but moist and fluffy on the inside.  In contrast, the french toast I received was made of thin slices, and had a homogeneous and slightly mushy texture.  Their bacon was a little under-cooked.  It wasn't horrible, and it's around the corner from some good friends of mine, so I might conceivably go again...  but strictly speaking, I'd rather just go to Starving Artist!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   Definitely a go-to spot in the city if you want a guaranteed tummy-filling, I-need-a-nap-now, I've-died-and-gone-to-brunch-heaven dining experiences.  You've been warned, there are lines to wait in for a delicious meal here, which can range from 20 minutes on the very lucky and rare occasion, to well over an hour on weekends. This can be a deterrent in inclement weather (waiting outside in a snowstorm? ...not so fun), when faced with hunger pangs or accompanied by an impatient dining companion. But it's worth it.  Things to get here which have never failed to delight my taste buds:  1) Breakfast pocket - extremely flavourful and packed with yummy breakfast items (scrambled eggs, bacon, cheddar, caramelized onions), a specialty of the place which I've never quite found a comparable for elsewhere. If you try anything here, I'd recommend this.  2) Breakfast tacos - I find variations of this dish can sometimes be less than tasty at certain other brunch spots, but not here. The cheddar is nicely sharp, the refried beans are flavourful, and it all comes together in a nice combination of flavours and textures in your mouth.  3) French toast - I've mostly tasted this classic via bites of other people's orders, but my friend swears by it as his favourite in the city, and he almost exclusively eats french toast when brunching (why, I will never understand, given the plethora of options available)  One caveat: you likely will smell like what you've eaten for breakfast the rest of the day after coming here. This could be a good or bad thing. Depending on whether you like to relive your breakfast dining experience throughout the day (not as bad as it sounds)."}
{"text":"A&U is a long-standing institution for brunch. It has that cool boho vibe with fairly-priced food and decent portions. Breakfast pocket is pretty stellar for the hungry ones; peameal back bacon is on-point. Come on an off-day or arrive early to skip the brunch wait time i.e. come before 10AM, at least."}
{"text":"So, aunties and uncles is really pretty, the deco is nice, the food is good, but they don't have WiFi and I found the service awful!!  I don't like when restaurants don't think about foreigners haha and I had to ask some words that I didn't know to the waitresses (like challah) and they were like eye rolling all the time... I almost didn't want to tip them"}
{"text":"Best bacon and eggs in the city.  Hands down.  Aunties and Uncles is another one of those food places in the city that is run by late 20-/early 30-year-olds but this one is definitely my favourite.  Serving only breakfast and lunch, they've garnered themselves a clientele of repeat customers that wait for 30-45 minutes during weekend brunch just to get a table.  They have a small menu, and always have 4 or 5 specials, which always sound delicious.  Over my past 6 months of regular attendance, I have not once been disappointed.  The staff there is friendly, but sometimes they come off as snooty.  I choose to see it not as snooty, and more as the kind of wait staff that is not all bubbles and lollipops, the kind you will see pretty much everywhere else.  Bubbles and lollipops are nice, but so is personality. Speaking of personality, (segue!) this restaurant has it.  With old vinyl chairs and never match and walls that are plastered with all sort of memorabilia from times gone by, Aunties and Uncles works to maintain that 'classic' feel.    If waiting in line is not your thing, be sure to get there early, as the line tends to form at around 11 on the weekends.  Your other option is to go during the week, when you'll almost never wait. In addition to being closed on Mondays, I've discovered that the store is always close on the weekend of a holiday (ie. Labour day weekend).  Keep that in mind when deciding to go."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in toronto. Actually foods are not extremely delicious, moreover coffee is disgusting but the atmosphere makes you feel like home. I live very far away from my family so the decorations feel me like i visit my grandmother's place  i usually eat the omelette of the day..."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so hyped. We went there after hearing good things about it on a fine Saturday morning. There was a huge line and we had to wait for 45 minutes before getting a place (further inflating the hype).   We ordered the usual omelates and stuff since we didn't want to eat the special burger in the morning,the food was nothing special or extraordinary. There is a very hipster ambiance to it, perhaps that's the attraction? Coz the food certainly wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff was lousy. Went on a Saturday so naturally very busy. But then staff the place accordingly? Was told it would be a 30 minute wait. Waited for an hour. Sat down and felt rushed the entire time. I get it, you're busy. But don't make me feel like I can't chill and digest my meal.   Was interrupted during my meal 3 times as a \"please leave now\" within 20 minutes. Yes, I was only there for 20 minutes after waiting an hour.   I used to go to this place about 3 years ago all the time before I moved. Because the food was rad, staff was attentive and chill, and great ambience. But now, I guess they feel secure enough to treat customers poorly. What a shame. Aunties and uncles suffers from a common epidemic in Toronto: that which becomes great, we push out. That which was great becomes very bad. Would not even step foot in again."}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast joint: french toast with bacon, or the breakfast tacos. And don't forget james and his perfect lattés. And if you don't like banana pancakes as my 7-year-old doesn't, russ will do a batch of plain. great place. alway worth the wait."}
{"text":"love their omelet!!  good : good price/ friendly server bad : only cash/ u should wait in the line/ location"}
{"text":"So rude. I never give 1-star reviews but think it is absolutely necessary in this case.  Barely acknowledged our existence when we arrived (inside I was already thinking 'f-this, lets go', but we were with a few other people) then acted as if it was a complete nuisance to bring us food and coffee. Food was so-so.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch with a group of 4 people, after hearing great things about the place and constantly seeing lines out the door. I agree with all previous Yelpers that the wait is insane. They had multiple empty tables for 2, but wouldn't seat anyone in the line until the first groups were seated, which didn't make any sense! Anyway, when we finally sat down to eat our drinks were promptly brought to the table - the coffee and fresh juices were great. We collectively tried the following items: breakfast pocket, potato salad, cinnamon french toast, and breakfast club. They were all generally really good with the exception of the breakfast pocket, which I found to be overly buttered and served on dry bread. In fact it is not really a pocket at all but rather a sandwich.   All in all, it was a fairly good meal but not something I would line up for again."}
{"text":"We go here pretty often. almost every weekend.  We ONLY go for the pancakes and home fries  The service is horrible, the serves are often rude and seem annoyed that they're there.  If the food wasn't so good I would be giving this place one star for bad service"}
{"text":"Aunties & Uncles ? What the hell is this place?  It should really be called: \"An awkward family meal at my 2nd cousins and the guy she's been seeing off/on for 3 years\". Because that's what it felt like.  Word of the Review: Awkward   We decided to not go at a peak time as we knew there was often a line up...  so we showed up after the brunch rush to get a quick helping of food / caffeine.   There was a SMALL line, but the turnover was just embarrassingly slow... people waiting at their tables cash in hand for a server - with the folks eagerly waiting  by the door to sit down - it was like the music shut off during musical chairs and we're just idling until the play button gets hit.   New Word of the Review: Waiting   So we waited and waited until a few tables got clear and the server starts seating the single customers at tables of 4 so that larger parties have to wait even longer to eat - I get that it's a first come first serve basis, but if they developed a system where the single diners eat together, they wouldn't be so spread out. Also the servers seemed aggravated as they passed by the doorway through the line up of customers - If folks are in the way, ask them to wait outside, or put our names on the list don't scoff at the business WAITING to eat at your establishment... in fact just acknowledge us as a people at the door rather than barreling by with one glass of water in hand.   New New Word of the Review: System   Our server seemed a little too cool for school with his dead pan customer service technique - I get it, you aren't the most chipper about serving brunch at A/U's after a long night of drinking sidecars at Montauk, but a smile and friendly greeting would have been nice - even if you faked it.   New New New word of the Review: Put up or Montauk  Food took an average amount of time despite sitting right next to the kitchen - literally sitting beside it as the kitchen is right out in the open. But with the place holding 6/7 tables with a limited menu, I was hoping it would be out a little sooner.   Food was middle of the road brunch food - as was the price, and although I was satisfied with the meal... I found the whole experience uncomfortable. The chairs, the heat from the kitchen, the overuse of garlic in all their food.... the whole place didn't jive with me despite it's home style kitchen atmosphere.  I'd probably pick a handful of other places over A/U's, and would only go there if there was no line - nothing else open -  AND IF IT WAS THE LAST RESTAURANT EVER, AND THE MONKEYS WERE PEOPLE, AND THE PEOPLE WERE ENSLAVED BY THE MONKEYS AND DIDN'T TALK, BUT THEN THE ONE FROM SPACE COULD TALK AND I BET THE MONKEYS DIDN'T LIKE THE TALKING PERSON SO THEY CAPTURED HIM BUT NOT ALL THE MONKEYS HATED HIM BECAUSE ONE OF THEM DIDN'T AND HELPED HIM ESCAPE BUT WHEN THEY ESCAPED THE OTHER MONKEYS FOUND OUT AND THEY WEREN'T HAPPY ABOUT IT.  New New New New word of the Review: Montauk the Planet of the Apes."}
{"text":"(Please note that I went on a SATURDAY afternoon)  I would give 3.5 because I had to wait for over an hour for a table of one AND an additional 35minutes for my food to arrive. But I upped to 4.0 stars because their food is pretty on point and the staff also accomodated by giving a free (half) pancake-like-thing (which was actually kind of chewy and hard). It was the fact that they acknowledged my patience (which is not alot actually!).   I finally went today to take it off my to-go-to list of restaurants in Toronto. It really is great! The retro style decoration cannot be found anywhere in Toronto and makes it feel like you're in someone's home.   First thing I noticed sitting down was that the table was sticky. It was probably the finish on the wood coming off but I was too hungry to really care.   I got the Breakfast Sandwich with Salad. It was scrambled egg (soooo good), with carmalized onions, peameal bacon and mustard in a focaccia bread (super soft!). It was so amazing....it MELTED in my mouth. Total came up to just under $10, plus tax around $11.  The staff are pretty friendly and quite approachable. It was really nice of them to make-up for the fact that I had waited almost 1.5hr for my table and an additional 35minutes for my food.   I would come here again in a heartbeat but the hour wait would probably make me re-consider."}
{"text":"If you are willing to wait for close to an hour on a Fall Sunday, your appetite will be well rewarded!  We were a group of 5 squeezed in on a corner table!  I ordered the cheesy omelet (gouda, cheddar and ....? I forgot!) and I love cheese. It was soft. The omelet had just the right consistency. The home fries had a slight creamy taste - a flavour undetected until my brunch companions pointed it out!  And the challah bread was a gigantic, buttery, delicious treat. That toast in itself could be a sustaining breakfast!  Even the diner coffee was a step above the usual grind!"}
{"text":"Came here twice, and both times just as satisfied (and forgot that was it was a cash-only place...).   The most recent one, I got the omelet of the day which was with spinach, havarti (!!), and other assorted veggies. For the price of only $8.75, you get that + I had the potato salad and tossed greens. I'm not much of a fan of potato salad, but for this one I'll make an exception (would of been super if they made it sweet potato salad!).   Both time I came have been on a weekday brunch, as I've seen how it gets during the weekend and I would like to keep this review as happy as can be.   The service is decent, and the only thing that bothers me is the cash-only policy... you can't tell me I'm the only one who forgets?!"}
{"text":"After seeing this place get a bunch of great reviews, it's about time that I decided to give this place a try so my friend and I ventured out to Aunties & Uncles for some grub!  Before I start reviewing this, HOW DOES THIS RESTAURANT NOT HAVE ANY ICE? I asked the server if I could have a glass of ice so I can pour a hot cup of coffee in it since it was so hot and humid today. I'd even pay extra if I had to, but the server told me that they ran out of ice and don't have anymore. WHAT? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?! I was absolutely devastated, I'm not the type to lash out about these things but really? NO ICE? I wanted to cry. Their excuse was that they didn't have enough room for an ice-box. They should really invest in one, just saying.  Inside, the decor was very old school with the mismatch of furniture similar to Lady Marmalade's decor but a little bit more run-down and antique looking. They have a open kitchen as well but it was very tiny.  The service here was attentive and the servers were very polite and nice.  Now onto the food, I ordered the breakfast tacos while my friend ordered their blueberry pancakes.  It took a while for the food to come but I wasn't really worried about that since I'm very patient.  The breakfast tacos were alright, kind of tasteless but it filled me up. I liked the meaty salsa-like sauce in the taco, it gave the tacos a nice zingy kick to it. I had two side dishes to choose from, potato salad or the hash browns and I chose the hash browns. Why would you call it hash browns when it's just potatoes lightly panfried. I was hoping it'd be little fried bits of goody goodness of potatoes but it wasn't. Very misleading.  Now onto the blueberry pancakes....oh where oh where to start....I'm speechless. Just thinking about those pancakes makes me want to hurl. It tasted horrible. It didn't even taste like pancakes. It tasted very undercooked and nothing tastes worst than undercooked batter of any sort. My friend almost died from eating it (exaggeration but seriously, it was that bad).  So my final verdict is that I will not be visiting this establishment ever again because it just wasn't worth my money and time.  I've had way better tasting brunch elsewhere. I don't understand the hype for this restaurant, I really don't. I wanted to love this place but this restaurant was lacking in food quality and taste. Who knows, we might've went on a bad day but the food was sub-par.  The truth hurts but it just wasn't an enjoyable food experience, I'm sorry Aunties & Uncles, I really wanted to love you like how the others love you but I just can't. I'm deeply sorry."}
{"text":"I've heard about how great this place is but never went because I would always hear about how incredibly packed it is. But I managed to make it one rainy weekday about 30 minutes before they were closing.  Yes, the place is pretty hipster. The people working there all looked borderline homeless with lumberjack shirts and beards to match. But they all seemed nice in a \"don't really give a fuck\" kind of way.  I had the Breakfast Pocket I believe it was called? It was insanely delicious. After I finished the first half I was wondering if I could tackle the second, and I came in feeling quite hungry. The coffee was alright but I don't usually get too picky when it comes to my daily caffeine.  The decor is interesting but reminded me a little too much of a redneck Northern Ontario vibe. The photos on the wall of old graduating classes were enough to keep my eyes occupied, but other Salvation Army themed furniture made me think of uncomfortable moments in places like Angus Ontario.  The price was right. In and out very quickly and felt very satisfied with the food I ate. Plus I was a tad hungover and didn't feel sick eating things like eggs and peameal bacon, so they must have done something right."}
{"text":"I'm much like everyone when it comes to this brunch spot. Had to try it because it's always on that list of must-go-to's. The line-ups. Does it live up to being line up worthy.  Well, if you know the line is coming. Grab a coffee and wait with someone easy going so the line just doesn't matter too much.  Customer service is spot on. When you ask what is good and they don't say the ubiquitous 'everything' line - I'm more than likely to believe them. She was right. Their hash browns and pancakes were the absolute highlight. Without a doubt I was surprised by the pancakes. I rarely order them and I must say best I have had in the city. They weren't dense - they were light, fresh and flavourful.   Honestly, I would love another plate right now.  I ordered the croque Monsieur which had that lovely melted cheese and ham heaven. I would definitely order that again.   Though there was a lineup. We didn't seem to feel pressure to move on - in fact, we took our time and ordered more food. Always a good sign people.  I fear this place is not a good place to line up for in the winter. That I just couldn't do because the spaces inside aren't As plentiful ."}
{"text":"I'm a big breakfast person so I do have high expectations for breakfast places. We decided on having breakfast here based on yelp reviews. The food is ok but not worth waiting 30 minutes to be seated. The only memorable thing was the fact we had the peameal bacon which we found out was authentic canadian bacon.   Just a tip: Bring cash because they're actually cash only."}
{"text":"5 star for the food and service 4 star for the location  We've had three different sandwiches with three different choice of sides. All of them are well-prepared and very delicious. Especially the aunties and uncles club!  My favourite side is the home fries, which is a whole potato. Also the ketchup taste very good. Yes, also the grapefruit juice.  The place is an interesting location to be, however parking is very very annoying."}
{"text":"Only cash!! Went on a sunny Sunday. We had to wait around 35 mins. to get table. Once i got inside I knew this place was overrated. The \"fresh juice\" was totally fresh, but from a box lol I ordered the Breakfast Pocket with Potato Salad while my friend had the Banana Pancakes. It was good and filling. But i don't think i would spend my time to get a table there again."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts in the GTA, but don't be in a hurry as the wait for a table, and then for your food, can be almost unbearably long. Worth the wait? Oh yeah!  You will leave very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I've heard and read a lot of hype about Aunties & Uncles. Unfortunately, for our little brunch crew it didn't live up to the experience we were hoping for.  Spent about 45 mins in line waiting for our cramped little table - which I'm fine with and understand is often a necessary price to pay for good food. Sadly, the food was decent but absent of any standout or exemplary qualities.   The only thing that really stood-out was the group of 4 sitting (in what would eventually become our table) for over 30 mins chatting away, table long cleared-off and bill payed, as if they had no idea of the huge queue of hungry people clearly visible through the windows. Go to Starbucks if you want to sit around and chat!  End Rant."}
{"text":"I have had amazingly delicious breakfasts in many cities and towns all over the US and beyond.  I am going out on a limb and saying, it was the best breakfast I have ever had.  From the grilled brie with pear chutney and walnuts on brioche to the blueberry pancakes, home fries, everything we ate was so ridiculously good.  Fresh ingredients, homemade ketchup, the nicest people cooking and serving, truly a memorable experience. Thanks guys, see you next time around."}
{"text":"Best brunch ever! The waitresses were really nice !  Definitely the place to go to if you want to enjoy a good burger for breakfast. Be sure to arrive early as it's reputation is growing. You might find yourself waiting in line If you don't."}
{"text":"We waited patiently in line for about an hour for a table at Aunties and Uncles, which really built up the anticipation.  We were in search of Toronto's best brunch and had read up on a few reviews which said that this was THE place.  The food was GOOD, but nothing spectacular...the eggs and Canadian bacon were good (it's hard to find good ole Canadian bacon in Toronto!), and the potatoes were quite yummy, but nothing which would stand out as \"bring-me-back-here-again-for-more!!\". The french toast was pretty average as well....cooked crispy with a bit of cushy softness...nice taste, but nothing that will stick out in my mind...  The prices were good, but we forgot that it was cash only, which made us make a trip to the local neighborhood ATM, which always is annoying.  Still looking for Toronto's best brunch................"}
{"text":"So...the consensus seems to be:  It's busy on the weekends.  No surprise there.  Here's a tip:  Go during the week.    This joint is indescribably charming.  The decor is sort of shabby retro/rustic; the music is 70s light hits (think \"Rhinestone Cowboy,\" \"Oh What A Night,\" \"Hooked on a Feeling,\" etc.); the service is entirely casual and the atmosphere convivial.    The menu is rather limited but you should find something to tickle your fancy, either sweet or savory.  I ended up with the breakfast pocket, which is not pockety at all.  It's a sandwich on a plain focaccia:  eggs, peameal, cheddar, tomatoes, carmelized onions, and dijon/garlic aioli.  I loved the Turbo from Lakeview but this sandwich was nothing short of phenomenal--the perfect combination and balance of ingredients.  Maybe my favorite breakfast sandwich in recent memory.  The simple, lightly dressed green salad was good too, as was the fresh orange juice.  There's nothing to disrecommend this place except that they were apparently having problems with wasps on their patio."}
{"text":"This place is definitely more about the \"decor\" than the food.  Pros: - coffee was good  - cheap! - banana pancakes were good, but something I could make at home.  Cons: - the chutney in the Brie sandwich was not pleasant  Meh... I've had better, could have skipped on this one."}
{"text":"\"All the hype can't undo undercooked food coupled with indifferent service\"   After all the rave reviews, I so looked forward to visiting this venerable establishment. The setting quaint like a small town hideaway nestled less than a block away from a major thoroughfare. The offerings: an all-star line-up of breakfast classics. How can one falter from such a winning combination?  A server with a mighty chip on her shoulder and adding insult to injury, a kitchen putting out pancakes that were thoroughly undercooked is how!   The sandwich board that blocks entry into their patio, prior to opening, states they are open every day from 9:00 to 3:00. While I can't speak to their closing time, they open when the server is good & ready. On the day I visited several minutes after nine despite the lineup and already searing heat. I suppose allowing customers to just sit comfortably while informing them that orders would only be taken once they open was too much of an imposition for her.   Diners were not served on a first come, first served basis either. Being first in line didn't seem to advance my place in this coveted institution one iota. As other patrons who were clearly behind me in the queue were served first.   Although Blueberry pancakes are not on their menu, several reviewers have praised Aunties & Uncles rendition. A request for these meant another delay while my haughty server had to check with the kitchen.   On first appearance and bite, this was a welcoming dish garnished with fresh strawberries and blueberries. The very outer edges slightly crispy and outer ring nice and fluffy. What followed in the very centre of the dish, a thoroughly unpleasant surprise: it seemed undercooked. Another bite confirmed with an unmistakable texture of raw dough... yuck! Given how long I had waited in line, place my order and for the food to finally arrive there was no desire, which would mean another delay and possible debate, to send it back.   A long-held fond wish to eat at Aunties & Uncles came crashing down with a rather remarkable thud."}
{"text":"Yeah, so this place just isn't that good.  Definitely wasn't worth the 45+ minute wait.  Sure, it's kitschy and cute and since you're probably a smelly hipster, you won't notice the lack of cleanliness... but I'd have been just as happy with a medium double-double and 3 timbits, and I would have saved myself $25."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on the last Friday of our Toronto vacation.  The atmosphere is a hodge podge of eclectic memorabilia and knick knacks. A funky vibe.  Our waiter and the grill man were both friendly and gregarious. The service was on point.  Our breakfast was awesome. The Banana Oatmeal Pancakes (with a side of sunny-side up eggs and bacon) were outstanding. My other half had the Omelet Of The Day and loved it.   And the price was very reasonable (as compared to other places we had breakfast at during our stay).  If we travel back to Toronto, we will definitely have breakfast here again."}
{"text":"So I haven't been here in ages and never on a weekday. Bonus: No weekday lineup - YAAY! Tip: CASH ONLY PEOPLE! I was curious to see if the quality of food had been maintained. Yep! We sat downstairs, (love the surroundings - all decor from mostly the 50's - formica kitchen tables, signs, wall decorations, tons of stuff to look at) there were 2 or 3 tables full on the main floor, but it was definitely not packed. We had the scrambled eggs (choice of 3 sides - I chose potato salad, peameal bacon and mixed greens) and he had the Breakfast Pocket. The eggs were good - nothing amazing, but nothing to complain about, the potato salad had a nice flavour kick of added dijon mustard. The greens were great - lots of zingy arugula thrown in along with a bit of spinach. The peameal was good. The Breakfast Pocket was good - a bit dry. This is the only place I would order homefries from - they do it right - crispy with onions! They do bring a side of (house made?) ketchup that has added kick and spices in it. It was definitely as good as I remembered - great attention to detail, food-wise. Unfortunately, hipster dude server was really doing the minimum (which didn't take away from the food, but did affect the overall experieence). Note: Not wheelchair accessible - washroom in basement or upstairs. I'd come back for the food."}
{"text":"The long lines to get in are puzzling until you experience the slow service... seriously, what do they all see in the place except for a little charm and an American style brunch menu? I had the Brie and pear grilled cheese and someone thought it would be cool to drown it in some crappy dried herbs (in high summer--tip for restaurants: use real, fresh herbs when readily available, I do at home so who wants to eat your expired McCormick spices when paying big bucks?) and garnish with ketchup (yup, you heard right). Granola and yogurt, passable. Maybe you should try the eggs, I wished I'd ordered an omelet or something else. No one offered water (is that a conservation thing now?) and we couldn't get the server to bring the bill to let the next poor victims in from the hot sun. Lines are inevitable here, if inexplicable. Maybe you'll have more luck."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I just ordered teh wrong thing, or if I'm just not a fan of this place. I had heard great things about it so I thought  iwould give it a try. The decor inside is cool, it's vintage and quirky.   I ordered the Scrambled eggs with bacon, home fries, and fruit. The eggs were ok. Homefries were good but kind of bland. The bacon was not that great, it was really thin and dry. Teh fruit was poached pears with cinnimon (I think) and it was not good (or maybe just wasn't what I was expecting)  The cappuccino was prepared very quickly and was pretty good  Prices are low, so if you're looking for a cheap brunch spot with some different options, this might be a good choice. I don't think  I would come back given the amount of delicious brunch spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for brunch because it was one of the top rated brunch restaurant on blogTO. We arrived around 12:30 and there was already a long line outside the restaurant. 45 mins later we get a seat.   I got the breakfast pocket which I really enjoyed. The bun was nice and crisp and the mustard sauce was amazing! I got home fries on the side which were alright (I prefer the super crispy deep fried ones whereas these ones are just panfried) and they were served with homemade ketchup which I personally did not enjoy as much.  I wish the wait for our food wasn't as long but seeing as they make everything in house and fresh, I can understand why. Overall food was good, definitely VERY filling as their portions are very generous. Will keep you stuffed for a while."}
{"text":"Food and prices are great but service is slowwwwww and nothin' but attitude. Also, it's cash only, which screams bad hygiene and money laundering. It's worth going to try it out but it's unlikely to become a regular brunch place unless you live super close. Specifically on the service side, we had to ask over and over for water refills (honestly just bring a jug if you can't be bothered to come check on people) and had to wait way too long for ketchup and jam. It's a tiny place and there were a bunch of people working so I can't really understand the slow service."}
{"text":"This place is very good, but I think it has been overly hyped and have some doubts about whether it's really as good as its supposed to be, at least based on a single visit.  Decor is funk chic.  I am sure the kitchen is very clean but the dining room does not appear to be so.  I had a special of banana pancakes with walnuts, which were delicious.  The egg dishes of other members of our party were good too.  Though only open for 90 minutes at the time of our arrival, they told us they were already 86 on the waffles.  We arrived fairly early and a very short wait in line, though the kitchen was quite slow in producing the food.  When we left, the line was way down the block.  My personal feeling about this place is that it is a pleasant place to go if there is no line, but I would not wait for two hours to be seated - it is not quite that heavenly.  Given the small number of table and slow pace of the kitchen, any waiting line does not move very fast either.  Service was quite friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto on vacation and came here after reading an article calling it the best brunch in Toronto.  It was good, but not great.  I loved the atmosphere but best brunch in Toronto?  They do standard items well: everything was tasty and the portions were big but it wasn't mind blowing.  And the service was poor- very very slow.  We waited 30 minutes to get seated (totally fine) and then waited an additional 30 minutes to order and another 30 for our food to come.  Good food but not worth the 1.5 hours we waited for it."}
{"text":"Just okay. Honestly, overpriced for what you get. And customer service? It was as if we weren't even there! I had to get out of my chair to ask for more coffee. Food was just mediocre. Would NEVER come here again."}
{"text":"Overrated.  I was totally prepared to wait (based upon other reviews) and actually only had to wait about 45 minutes.  Maybe even less (and this was on a Sunday).  And, I spent most of that time enjoying a delicious cup of coffee from Manic around the corner (grab a cup and come back to sit on the benches out front of Aunties and Uncles - better to enjoy the WiFi, my dears...)  The food: A-OK.  Got the banana oat pancakes, which were... interesting.  They had a strong yeast taste to them.  Not really my thing.  But they came with some really good fresh fruit.  Also got the breakfast tacos.  They were tasty.  But would I wait 45 minutes for them?  Probably not.  For me, the obnoxious hipster crowd was a detractor.  I mean, the girl sitting next to me at our picnic table could not have been any more annoying.  And then her friend would not stop blasting hipster music out of his cell phone.  So, if you like waiting for long periods of time and hanging out with hipsters while eating A-OK food... go for it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a brunch date. The place is cute and charming. The menu selection is basic for a brunch place - which I actually liked. I ordered the french toast - very well made and tasted great.  The reason I give this place a 2 star is because THEY ONLY TAKE CASH. I mean, come on, it's 2013. Credit/debit cards are the norm - most people don't carry cash with them. I had to go around looking for an ATM, spent 4.50 to withdraw. I would rather them have a card machine there and charge me a fee than make me go through the stress of looking around for an ATM.  I won't come here again just because I hate all these new places that are opening up that don't take credit/debit."}
{"text":"I'd been waiting to try this place out for quite some time, and glad I finally did. Had the breakfast pocket which was really good. Opted for the potato salad instead of the hash browns since potato salad is something that isn't often served with breakfast. Their potato salad was pretty good, but a little salty. My brother had the hash browns and they were out of this world. If this is your first time going, do not forgo the opportunity to have the hash browns.  The service was good. Waiter was attentive, knowledgable about the menu, and no mistakes were made.   Atmosphere was cozy.   Definitely recommended, but prepare to wait to get a table!"}
{"text":"Tiny little hole in the wall.  Crappy slow service.  It wasn't even busy in there but they seemed understaffed and brunch for two took 2 full hours.  I watched a waiter (or manager?) yell at another waitress that was working on the floor.  It was really inappropriate, and turned into a heated discussion which should have taken place behind closed doors.   I ordered the breakfast tacos and hashbrowns which were admittedly excellent.  I felt really ill for the rest of the day though (probably too much grease), so it wasn't worth it.   Really wished they had a mimosa on the menu, but alas they don't appear to have a liquor license.  Settled for a latte, but they brought me a black coffee instead.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Food is well priced and tastes good. Waiters and waitresses were kind and respectable as well as quick with their orders and bill.   Would be a perfect mark if not for the wait time."}
{"text":"I went here a long time ago, before I knew of yelp, and returned recently. The only issue for me is I'm vegan, so there's really only one or two things I can eat for breakfast at this place. which does suck, I know. Everything looks amazing. I just stared at everyone's food as it went by. If you're not vegan... go for brunch here! I like that's it's in house and has the old diner feel. It would be a cool place to take people from out of town. Except there's not much air circulation, so you'll leave smelling like fried potatoes, which is kinda gross and a pet peeve of mine, but whatever.   The potato salad is great. It's vegan. Vinaigrette based with some spicy dijon. Much better then the tradition mayo based potato salads. Other then that, I'm sorry I can't speak much to the food but I can tell it's delicious and it is a reasonably/cheaply priced brunch. Just a heads up, you'll be waiting a long time for a table and outside. There's only seating room inside, so don't go if the weather is bad!"}
{"text":"For the price, this place ain't a bad brunch option. The scrambled eggs weren't half bad. The OJ was nice. I'de say you're going here more for folksy atmosphere than the food.  Their omelette topping choices are not exactly varied. Their featured omelette for the day I went had cauliflower in it. cauliflower?  if you want a killer brunch, hoof cafe is my pick. nobody in the city does pig like those guys."}
{"text":"The wait was long but the food is good. I had the Grilled Brie Sandwich with Pear Chutney and Walnuts on Challah (added bacon as well).   Try to go early in teh morning to avoid the lineup...  Service was friendly and quick..."}
{"text":"Short version: disappointing and overrated. Service is slow, cold, and inattentive. Food is ok, but doesn't justify the service or the wait. If a brunch place doesn't serve booze, you know it must be about the food, but the food here definitely doesn't live up to it. Sunday brunch hour - how can you only have two waitresses staffing AND hosting???  Long version: We came here after hearing so much about it on BlogTO, which listed it as the best brunch place in the area. I'm really into brunch, so we were pretty excited about checking this place out.  By 11am on a Sunday the place was already very full and there was a small mob outside waiting for spots. First issue came up pretty quickly - the hostess-waitress didn't have a systematic way of taking people down. You're supposed to just wait until she comes once every 15 minutes or so to address the hungry mob and put your name down. As a result, it's not a very fair or organized way to take down names - she took down people who had just gotten there before people like me who had already waited 15 minutes.   They have long tables in the patio, so if you're a party of smaller than 4 you'll probably be seated at the same table as strangers, as we were. This wasn't really a problem, but they don't really have efficient system of seating. We waited for 30 minutes plus the 15 before our name was taken down, which was frustrating because there were many empty patio spots - it seemed like the waitress really just wasn't good at seating people efficiently.   We ordered the burger special - brie, bacon, and egg on a burger. We also got an order of the blueberry pancakes. Maybe I'm used to something different, but the menu seems very limited for a place that *only* serves brunch - only one type of pancake, french toast, one burger, two kinds of omelets. They had run out of waffles before noon on Sunday. Really?  It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive. We also asked three times for an extra plate and hot sauce, which just never came. Silverware was visibly dirty, and we got a healthy eyeroll when we asked for a new set. We ordered the egg easy medium instead of easy over - the waitress definitely seemed a little annoyed that we were trying to customize our orders.   When the pancakes came, they were pretty much raw. Like, batter oozing in the center raw. The waitress tried to convince us it was \"the way it always was.\" Well, we weren't about to eat raw pancakes. We sent them back (another 10 minutes) for some french toast, which was just OK but took another 30 minutes to get to us.   The waitress retaliated by ignoring us for the rest of the morning. She would make a circuit and fill up everyone else's waters except for ours - including the party sitting at the same table as us, but would obviously skip us.   The unfriendly atmosphere and solidly medocre food meant we were ready to rush out ASAP. Too bad we had to wait another 30 minutes + forever each for our waffles to arrive, and then our bill to arrive, and then the bill to get settled, etc etc."}
{"text":"It's no secret that to get good brunch in this city you are going to be waiting.  I was meeting a friend here and got in early, so I had to wait for her anyway and got a table after about 20 minutes or so.  I then had about another 15 minute or so wait for my friend, and the staff were nice enough to let me hang and drink coffee while I did.  Very cool decor, loads of kitschy stuff to look at making for a chill and cozy atmosphere.  Menu isn't very big and yet I still struggled with what to get - everything sounded oh-so-good.  I opted for the Great Canadian Cheddar with tomato which came on challah bread and chose greens on the side, and you can't forget the house-made ketchup!  It sounds odd, but this sandwich reminded me not to forget about how insanely delicious cheddar is. I hadn't had straight up cheddar cheese this good in a long, long time and it was oozing out of this perfect challah masterpiece. The house-made ketchup is so tasty my friend asked for her own dish of it since she was using so much of mine.  I asked for a side of fruit as well, which I was told was poached pears - I wasn't happy to hear this (not a huge pear fan) but got it anyway.  Turns out, poached pears are nothing like eating a raw pear and it was really good - the pears were soft, juicy and sweet making for a perfect end to the meal.  Dying to go back and try more, service was quick and accomodating as well.  Be warned, they're cash only!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, good service and cool interior design. The only negative here is that you will always need to wait to get in and it's not good for large group of people. However, their food always made me wait outside for it."}
{"text":"Aunties and Uncles  I woke up on Saturday morning whining to myself that I was starving, sleepy, didn't feel like getting out of my pajamas, brushing my teeth, or cooking.  And then suddenly everything made sense.  I phoned up my best friend, walked out the door, took a whiff of my armpits (not bad) and in a flash there we were waiting in line (yes, always) at Aunties and Uncles.  Aunties and Uncles is a hole in the wall restaurant just off College Street.  With it's beaten up kitchen, somehow surviving from the fifties, black and white photos, and random conglomeration of antique chairs and tables, this no-bull brunch place is an old-school wonder suitable for families and hangover sufferers alike.  All the breakfasts come with heart-warming challah and potato salad and the French toast (made with challah as well) is out of this world."}
{"text":"Those banana oat pancakes are to die for.  The omelete was pretty standard and basic!   Such a warm and cozy ambience inside here!  It's almost as if you are visiting an an old house from the 60's.  The wall art and decor is all interesting to look at."}
{"text":"If you are in Toronto and havent gone yet, you better make some plans for tomorrow.  We were lucky enough to go on a day where there was a 2 minute wait while they cleared a table. The music was great (Billy Joel) and the place was cute/kitschy but didnt make you feel uncool. The staff was pretty friendly with all the patrons. Im pretty sure we were the only newbies there.   My husband left us at the door so he could go and try to find parking. We figured it would take lots of time to order and for the food to come. WRONG!! The service is super quick and the food was out in what felt like 5 minutes. I felt like such a loser telling the guy to please rush it cause we have an apt to get to across town. He had assured me it would be quick...i didnt believe him...and I was totally wrong.   The hubster had the cinnamon french toast with poached pears and was raving about them all the way through, i took a few bites and have to agree. I had the scrambled eggs with hashbrowns and poached eggs. The hashbrowns were so damn good, especially with the wonderful roasted garlic.   Our bill with a latte and cofee came to 21$ including taxes....awesome! See you again soon!  PS I would also like to include that they totally calmed down my son who was really not interested in being at a restaurant after waking from a nap. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Why do hipsters love this place so much? I'd heard amazing things and was underwhelmed. I think people are just so into mismatched china from the 70s that they stop paying attention to food.  Charming and hip interior, food is ok."}
{"text":"Super cute space, great music to get those weekend vibes going! We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table at 12pm on a Saturday and nearly the amount of time again for food - most likely because there was only one server. Other than that, the server was friendly as were the kitchen staff, the food was pretty tasty too (but probably not worth such a long wait) - I had the veg omelette with bacon and my friend had the breakfast tacos. Their homefries are sprinkled with delicious spices - I could eat them for days! It's a little bit odd, but the show stealer was the challah toast - so delicious and buttery with a pinch of sweetness, pop some jam on top and you've got yourself a main and dessert! We also saw the pancakes and Chicken BLT go out to another table - I would love to return to eat that for a late lunch!"}
{"text":"Service is incredibly slow. I read the reviews before coming and thought it was weird that anyone would dock so many stars for bad service. Now I understand. It took me about ninety minutes to eat here, and I was only actually eating for twenty of those minutes. I walked in right after two people were seated. There were seats available. I made intermittent eye contact with the servers for at least twenty minutes before I was seated. My order was taken in a reasonable amount of time, but the food, just a burger and salad in a quickly emptying restaurant (I came nearly two hours before closing), mind took atrociously long. Servers were brusque, bordering on rude. One server refilled my water and spilled a lot on the table and my foot and did not even apologize or acknowledge what had happened.  Food here is a bit salty and fairly greasy. It's too bad I like their breakfast burger so much."}
{"text":"A pretty solid breakfast/brunch spot. We went on a weekday morning so the wait was nonexistent. I really liked the decor and the patio seating in the summer.   I had the Croque Monsieur without ham and my dining companion had an omelette. Both were delicious, and the serving sizes were generous. With the home fries and toast, Aunties & Uncles is a great budget-conscious brunch option, which is important since they're cash only. two entrees, plus a drink was about $25.   Service was attentive until we got our food, then we had to ask for more water and the bill took forever, even after we asked for it. These are fairly minor issues compared to how tasty the food is. I would definitely come back again to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast place I've been to. From the breakfast nook tables to the handmade ketchup this place is the shit"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Maybe I will give it another try. The place is cute but the service isn't very good.  We waited 20 mins in line which was ok as we made the decision to wait.  But we then waited 45 mins for our food. Not once did they come over to see if we wanted more coffee or to refill our waters.  The food looked good and my first bite was good but I found a hair in my sandwich. They handled it ok and offered me a new one and I know this happens even in clean places but I had already lost my appetite between the wait and the hair that I decided not to eat so I can't really comment on the food."}
{"text":"We were a group of 4 and went for brunch on a cold winter day. The wait was insane, almost an hour (after being told it would be half an hour or so). The waitress was rude when we asked how long the wait would be, and the efficiency in seating people was really subpar.   When we finally received our food, which took about 45min, it was mediocre at best. I'm quite disappointed after reading all the good reviews. The deco was cool but service and food made the overall experience just a 2 star. Will not be returning again."}
{"text":"Soup + omelette of the day every time, never fails to disappoint.  Service isn't particularly fast so don't go here if you're in a rush. But if you have time, it's a great place to get breakfast.  I can't really point out anything that's particularly good, since everything that makes up the omelette of the day is so damn good (challah toast, hash browns, and omelette). Though they give you the option of hash browns / salad / potatoes. I go for the hash browns every time.  The place gets pretty busy at around 11~12, I'd go early."}
{"text":"I have yet to find my breakfast place in Toronto. What I really look for is someplace cheap that knows how not to mess up my eggs (that's a runny yoke with absolutely no uncooked egg white) and doesn't have to defrost their homefries, which you think would be easy but you would be surprised. So when I heard about this place just around the corner from the university I was thrilled. I decided to try it out with my friend on weekend.  So you would think sitting outside in the beating sun for an hour and a half in order to get into Saturday brunch would turn a girl off, but I saw it as a positive: I figured the hungrier I was the more amazing the food would taste: wrong.  Don't get me wrong, there was nothing horribly wrong with the food, but these are my issues: - My eggs were undercooked - The fruit on my plate looked like it had sitting in the sun as long as I had - 15 dollars for eggs, bacon and a coffee isn't terrible, if all of these things are amazing, but this is a little mediocre. - Last but not least, people need to learn how to season properly (I swear it makes everything better)  The service was pretty good and the waitress was very friendly and then the minute she dropped off our plates it was like we were invisible even though the place had significantly cleared out before that happened."}
{"text":"There's nothing in the world quite like eating your eggs whilst surrounded by dead people's stuff. Old trading cards, mismatched tables, dusty trinkets, and mouldy plates add to the overall charm of Aunties and Uncles. This place truly is a MUST when you're in the mood for some authentic food poisoning.   The staff are there! The bread is stale! And the fruit salad is actually stewed pears! Who doesn't love a fruit salad made from stewed pear?! (It's the best way to prepare the words worst fruit if you ask me!)   But, the thing I enjoyed most about Aunties and Uncles, has got to be their steep stairway leading to the upper-slop-dining-headquarters. If you didn't already have a broken hip, you will now! A couple friends of mine went flying down that deathly ramp! Good thing the staff were there to do absolutely nothing.   I bet even if I was high their food would still taste bad.   Ugh.  With that being said, If you're ever in the area, and I hate you, do stop by Aunties and Broken Ankles."}
{"text":"Aunties and Uncles - Lippincott Street, Toronto - 3/15/10.  Yelp is a wonderful tool. With it, one can find the best places to try next if you have no other ideas of where to go. When you're looking for breakfast, for example, just search for that and pick away. Mrs. Bellyman did so the night before and turned up this Aunties and Uncles place in TO. It had all of the criteria that made it sounded like a perfect place for food:  - looks a little dumpy  - great food  - extremely limited seating  - eclectic atmosphere  With all of the proper variables in place, Belly Family headed over to fuel up for the day. So glad we did! Bellyman went with the omelet of the day, which was a tomato, asparagus and some kind of cheese (sorry, it was a very esoteric one Bellyman has never heard of, so Bellyman has forgotten it. It was only there that day, anyway.) It came with a side of grilled potatoes (they called them home fries. Bellyman repeats: if they're not FRIED, they're note FRIES!) and, get this: challah bread toast!  Mrs. Bellyman had the eggs and potato salad (Bellyman knows. Weird combo, right?) also with challah bread toast, and a side of yummy, salty peameal bacon. Little belly had the banana pancakes. Belly Parents also split a serving of home made ketchup (catsup?)! Gotta love a place that makes their own ketchup (catsup?)!  When Belly Family was done with breakfast, there was nothing left on the table but plates. Every single bite of food was devoured, it was all just amazing. The staff was friendly, and service was fast. Mrs. Bellyman would be hard pressed to drag Bellyman to another location for breakfast when in Toronto!  Verdict: Bellyman approves!"}
{"text":"Our first \"real breakfast\" in Toronto! We found this place on Yelp as it was very close to our AirBnB. We ordered the scrambled eggs with toast and double bacon and the banana oatmeal pancakes. Both was delicious!! We also both had a latte which was good as well.  Service was really friendly and fast, unfortunately this place only opens between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. - so we cannot go again at some time in the afternoon for a late brunch / early dinner. That really is a shame... :)   The patio is also very nice! :) Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not as amazing as the hype and the line suggest, but a great breakfast spot nonetheless. The service was friendly and I dig the homey, Value Village inspired decor - appropriate given the clientele.  The menu is simple and prices are very reasonable. The waffle ($6.25), served with delicious poached pears, was quite good. The scrambled eggs ($7.75) were good, but nothing special. The eggs came with choice of 3 sides, we went for cottage cheese, fruit (aka poached pears), and some delicious buttered challah toast.  I also scored a side of potato hash ($1.75), which was absolutely perfect. The potatoes are super tender and nicely seasoned. The orange juice ($2.50) was great as well and tasted freshly squeezed.  A good cheap breakfast/brunch option."}
{"text":"Once upon a time my friend Amy and I got drunk at a Christmas party one Saturday night. As we stumbled back to my place we discussed how great it would be to wake up early and go out fro breakfast the next day. We went to bed at 4 am. We woke up at 7 am.  We got to Aunties & Uncles at 8:45 am. And it was amazing.  First off? HANGOVER CURE! Yeah. Maybe it was the mix of great food and David Bowie playing in the background. Perhaps the cozy decor soothed our souls. Either way I felt fantastic.   The staff are super duper friendly cool. They let Amy and I in early because of the cold. They didn't get mad when I kept asking for water every two seconds. Thanks Aunties & Uncles staff!  Lovely! Be back soon!"}
{"text":"VIBE  It's kitsch. It's cute. It's homey. There are always tons of people waiting for a table.  They do have an upstairs though and man, that stairwell is steep. On a Sunday winter afternoon (around 1 p.m.) I waited 40 minutes for a table. So make sure you book a good two hours for your brunch date.   WE ATE  I had the special - omelette with mushrooms, arugula and havarti and hash browns. Delish! But I wonder if it would have been just as good if I wasn't ravenous starving because of the wait. Dining companion had the brie cheese with potato salad. She loved it. The potato salad isn't your typical fare - it's actual potatoes covered in a creamy dill sauce. YUM!  Freshly squeezed orange juice made it right. I will say no dish is over $10. It's quite fantastic value here.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Better than a visit to a relatives house if you can stand the wait. There's a reason I come here sporadically. Try to go on a weekday if you can."}
{"text":"i really like this place. Its always really busy though and not big enough to accommodate the high demand, which means they could raise their prices, but they don't, which is nice. Good food, friendly staff, well priced. More places in toronto should be like this."}
{"text":"Came in on Friday afternoon for a nice lunch on a rare day off work.  The wait for a table was a bit of time, but well worth it.  I was a solo diner and the wait staff made me feel right at home.  I had felt bad about taking an entire table to myself, but they told me not to worry -- the restaurant was small and they served people at individual tables.  Latte was wonderful, and my omelette and home fries was delicious!  To the woman who skipped the line and barged in on my table:  My agreement to allow you to sit with me was through sheer politeness.  It was not to ask for company - I was really looking for a nice quiet lunch for myself (I'm sorry if you felt otherwise).  Your insistence that you were there to provide me company despite the wait staff asking you to wait for a table and after customers who came in before you were does not justify as an excuse.  Your need to make conversation with me was not part of this agreement, and I was especially offended by your sheer disregard that you felt that you were justified to skip the line because you had short lunch hour.  Your outward justification that you were keeping me company implies that I solicited such company and conversation -- which I did not.  You were mistaken.  I, too, have short lunch hours at work -- unfortunately, I must eat at my desk at work as a consequence.  I don't take much time off work, but I was hoping to have a quiet lunch, which you did not permit but your sheer rudeness - thank you for showing me how fellow people can be so inconsiderate.    I hope that your future interactions with the human race are more considerate.  Perhaps you can reconsider your choices of lunch venues if you are short on time.  And your assumptions that solo diners want company is quite offensive - please refrain from doing this on a frequent basis.  Thank you to the wait staff for trying to allow me to have a quiet lunch."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place looks so adorable!! Love the multicoloured picnic tables and the all the plants. The food was also great and the eggs are a homerun! I had the pea-meal BLT and they melted cheese over the eggs-yummm! The reason that I didn't give 5 stars is that the service is quite slow. If you do decide to stop by, set aside a solid hour if not more as it will take you a while to get your food."}
{"text":"Every so often I will do a search of the top brunch restaurants in Toronto.  Without fail Aunties and Uncles appears in the Top 5. It seemed inevitable that I would be visiting this establishment to see for myself if in fact the food was as good as the reviews claimed it to be.  I am lucky to have great friends who are always willing to accompany me on my explorations to find Toronto's best brunch establishments. On this day in particular R & S joined me on my visit to Aunties and Uncles.  It was quite sunny and approximately 24 degrees. Perfect patio weather I thought.  Great for me since I love the sun, but based on the line-up at the restaurant, not everyone wanted to sit in the sun. So my friends and I lined up and waited for a table indoors. There is something about a line-up that increases one's expectations. I am one of those suckers that lines up to enter a store or restaurant when I see a line of people. Well hey, if there is a line, it must be good! Right?! Well, not necessarily.  We finally got a seated after waiting approximately 25 minutes. Not bad I thought. But then again, like I mentioned before, I like the sun.  We were seated in a corner in the back of the restaurant and it felt quite cozy. The restaurant did not have air conditioning, but on this day it felt bearable. We received our menus which had a 50's feel to them, and the three of us found the array of options acceptable.  Generally when I go for brunch I like to get a regular portion of a savory dish, but I always find myself craving either some French toast or pancakes.  So as usual, I scanned the menu for a side that would satisfy my sweet cravings, but there were no French toast or pancake side options. I was disappointed about that.  Not being very adventurous when it comes to brunch (I like the standard bacon and eggs breakfast), I decided to order the eggs (sunny side up), peameal  bacon, hash browns,  and a toasted bagel with butter for $8.25. R decided to try the Croque Monsieur for $8.25 and I encouraged her to try the potato salad since I had read many reviews noting how incredible it was. I would have tried the potato salad myself, except that I hate onions and there was a chance that there were onions in the mixture. I will never eat anything with onions in it. I did have to double-check with the chef that there were no onions in the hash browns. To my relief there were no onions!  S decided to get the eggs as well, except she chose to get challah toast (huge plus for me since I am quite partial to challah bread-large slices of bread with a hint of sweetness-what's not to love about that?!), and bacon for $8.25.  With our orders in, we chatted and caught up on each others lives as we usually do when having brunch. We did find ourselves trying to get the waiters attention on several occasions for coffee refills. In fact, I had to physically get up and search for our waiter to finally get a refill. It is disappointing when establishments that are successful, overtime lose interest in maintaining high service standards as it seemed to be the case here.  At the arrival of our food we took a moment to assess it. It seemed necessary considering all the hype this establishment has received. Were we floored? No. But we were satisfied. The portions were decent, the bacon was crispy, though a few minutes longer and it would have been considered burned. The hash browns were a bit of a let-down since what I received was one large piece of potato that was quite bland in the middle. It needed to be cut up into smaller pieces and then fried with at least some salt. My eggs which were meant to be runny were overcooked which prevented me from dipping my bagel in it as usually like to do with my toast and eggs. R seemed quite pleased with her choices, though she did not really agree that the potato salad was the best she ever tasted and S felt this was a decent breakfast.  Was this place worth all the hype? No. We agreed that we would certainly not be willing to line-up again for 25 minutes for the food and service we received. If we are going to line-up for food, we expect good service and some wow factors in the food we receive. Don't get me wrong, I love simple food, but I like simple and tasty, minus the \"diva-esque\" attitude.  As we got ready to leave we looked outside at the line that continued to form and grow and asked ourselves, \"really? Should we tell them that it is not worth it?\"  Ultimately, one should give the restaurant that year after year continues to fall in the \"Top 5 Brunch Restaurants\" a shot. Now I can check it off my list and say, \"yeah, been there. It was alright. Nothing special.\""}
{"text":"Well worth the wait on a Saturday. Delicious food. Maple-glazed pork tenderloin and eggs. The perfect cure for a hangover, I think."}
{"text":"Aunties and Uncles topped many lists that i have read declaring that they serve the best brunch in town.  On my last visit to Toronto, i decided to see what all the hype was about.  Upon walking into the joint, it screams nostalgia, with the knicknacks  and overlaping layers of wallpapers this placed screamed history.  We were met not greeted at the door, by a server who seemed very uninterested in serving us.  We weren't feeling super welcomed, but brushed it off and starting surveying the menu.  I ordered the standard breakfast plate, however you do not get to choose how your eggs are cooked, they come one way, scrambled.  I don't know if it is because they say a true cook is judged on how well they can cook eggs, and they play it safe and only serve them one way.  Anyways they came to the plate and they were good, but i do prefer them over easy.  The bacon that accompanied it was delicious. The potatoes with the addition of sweet potatoes was unexpected but totally welcomed, they added a nice sweetness to the standard starchy potatoes.  They serve the toast without jam, so i then had to wait for our server to come and ask him for jam, which they could have saved a step if they just asked if u want jam.  They make their own and i can see that they don't want give it to people, who aren't going to use it, they just need to serve their guests better all around.  My sis ordered the pancakes, and i can honestly say they were the worst pancakes i have ever had in a restaurant.  They were bland, and rubbery, when they should be fluffy.  We also had to wait at least 10 minutes to receive our check after we were finished eating.  Overall i liked my dish, but i could not go back solely because they food isn't worth dealing with the terrible service."}
{"text":"This might be my favourite brunch place in the city, even if only for one specific menu item. My big brunch dilemma is always, \"Sweet or savoury?\" but when I come here, hands down, the answer is sweet.  Okay, so. A ton of people here are complaining about the long wait. It's the truth! This place gets packed, especially in that neighbourhood, especially on the weekend. I've waited over an hour for a table for 2 in the winter, which is crazy, but it seems like the norm nowadays, and A&U is a very small place that just can't fit the amount of people that line up faithfully after a long night of drinking Sunday morning. Plenty of places in the city have long line-ups for brunch these days...It's just something people need to accept, and come prepared for. There's a reason why a dozen people lineup for an hour on a weekly basis; the food is just plain good and delicious! There are other places out there that can seat you quickly if that's what you're after.   Anyway. I'm one of the weirdos who will stand outside in the dead of winter for a plate of my favourite cinnamon french toast. It comes with caramelized pears which are probably the best part of the dish. I can't get enough! It's pretty plain and simple french toast, but there's something about it that is so different than when I make it at home. I've tried their other menu items, like the omelettes, pancakes, and sandwiches but the cinnamon french toast is by far my favourite item on the menu.   The place looks like a little old 50s house transformed into a restaurant. It's full of kitschy items and decor which really make it a fun place to be. The tables and chairs are old wood and have a well-loved and worn-in feel...I really do love it.   I haven't been in a while and now this review is making me crave that cinnamon french toast...I highly recommend this place, but be prepared to wait at least 30 min during peak hours, or come during a weekday and you could be seated in less than half an hour. And make sure to get the cinnamon french toast! Damn, it's good."}
{"text":"We were lucky and didn't have to wait too long to sit inside the small establishment.  The decor of this place is cute, but the washroom downstairs feels a bit like a storage room.  I ordered a hot chocolate, and scrambled eggs with bagel, potato salad, and breakfast sausage.  The food and drink tasted ok, the portion was fine, but the sausage was undercooked and it gave me an upset stomach.  Not sure why this place was considered one of the best brunch restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"They don't have eggs benny. :( So sad! I need eggs benny with homemade hollondaise sauce at every brunch place...  This place is way grimey and old looking. Traditional? Retro? Outdated and dirty. They even have rusty tin cans from the olden days for charm.  One of the servers didn't seem to really like her job. The place is small, cramped, and full of hungover people, so maybe her job is stressful.  Breakfast was ok. It was so blah I don't actually remember what I had. Omelette of the day maybe? zZzZz... Pancake servings are huge though but they looked pretty gross (by my standards) but my friend liked them.  Nothing that stands out at all. Hoof Cafe, Yasi's Place... Even Milestones has better brunch. This place is nearby so I might be back but it's unlikely."}
{"text":"With only a few small tables, a simple-yet-well done menu, and such great prices, it's no wonder that there are constantly line-ups at Aunties & Uncles.   Off of the brunch-centric card of eggs, omlettes, sandwiches, and soup, I chose the Belgian waffle. The light and fluffy waffle sided with chunks of juicy cooked pear and extra runny and not-too-sweet syrup. The freshly squeezed orange juice was pulpy and refreshing and made the perfect flavour combination.   The decor is made up of a mish mash of vintage children's books, action figures, and a non-functioning oversized clock. As long as you can get a table, Aunties & Uncles makes a great spot for relaxing on any lazy afternoon."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the wait.  Sure the decor and homey feeling of mismatched old school kitchen and chairs is cute but the food is nothing special and the lineups - even on a weekday in good weather - is crazy.  If you are hipster phobic, don't even think about going here!  Service was slow and having to ask several times for the bill was frustrating, no wonder the lineups are so long."}
{"text":"It took me forever to get here (like 2 hours), but it was worth the food and experience! THe most AMAZING banana pancakes. I still dream about this. The decor of the place is super cute... reminds me of someone's home in the 70's (although i wasn't alive yet) .....  The wait is LOOONG.. but so worth it. I would come to Toronto just to have this!"}
{"text":"the atmosphere of this place is unbelievable! seatings are inside and outside. it's nicely decorated with oldies and makes you feel like you're back in the 1950s. the food however could be better. i ordered the french toast because that's my go-to comfort breakfast food. it came with 3 slices of toast and a portion of fresh fruits because it was too small to be a side. the toast was dry and there was hardly icing sugar or butter with mine...it was only enough for the 1st piece. it didn't taste spectacular. the orange juice was alright. i expected more from this place because of the hype"}
{"text":"The food here is great and cheap. One of my favourite places for brunch. The only downer is that the place is so small and quite popular that theres usually a line just to get a table."}
{"text":"I came here to see what the hype is all about. Huge disappointment. The food was good I guess. But the wait is just a major turn off. I understand when the restaurant is packed so I have to wait outside. But it was NOT. I saw at least 3 empty tables outside and 1 inside when I arrived. They have been left empty for at least 15 min. And the other dining tables which meant to be for 4-6 people were only seated with 2 people. I really don't understand why they do that except MAYBE they want people to see a line outside which may attract more attention. I don't know. But people in the line can see clearly that they can be seated but was told waiting for no reason. Also I don't understand why they have to make people line up outside instead of putting their names down. I understand there may be more administrative work for them but our time is as valuable as the staff in the restaurant.   Other than that, the staff was super nice. I mean, I would be super nice too. There is absoultely no pressure working in this place. I can take my sweet time to serve anybody at any time I want.  Also, I wish they renovate and clean the bathroom. I understand they may want to preserve that old country look, but dang!"}
{"text":"This place is solid but not worth the lineups. I've never left dissatisfied with either the food or service but neither is anything more than above average."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, horrible service and expect to wait because everybody wants to eat here, but the food is worth it.   Definitely get the peameal (Authentic Canadian Bacon) sprinkled with corn meal for Brunch."}
{"text":"Prepare for a little wait especially on weekends.  The Breakfast Pocket and Breakfast Tacos were delightful."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday but still needed to wait for 20 minus.  I love the rustic and vintage style.  I had scramble egg with p. bacon and fruit.  I was recommend to have the home fries. The bacon and egg were prefect but according to my friend, it wasn't as good as his last visit.  But the dish is great overall. The most interesting is the fruit; it's warm pear with cinnamon.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap for the portion you get. Pancakes at ($7.50) with a small side of fruit and of course, MAPLE SYRUP! Delectable. Texture of the pancakes were light and fluffy. Didn't get many banana chunks, a bit dissapointed there, but still very delicious. Not rich, but just right. Overall, it was delicious and I will be going back to try their other menu items! Oh yeah, and the atmosphere is just cozy especially on a lazy morning when there's no line ups yet, just a few people doing their own thing. Absolutely love it. *Thumbs up*"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the wait for a table on a Saturday or Sunday is ridiculous! What is Toronto's fascination with brunch? So many people weren't there when their names were called it was kind of hilarious. I'd go elsewhere too but my guy really wanted to try this place. So we waited. We dropped off his phone for repair. We went furniture (window) shopping. We came back and waited.  Finally having been seated on their quaint patio, we once again WAITED 20 minutes for our order. See the theme? It should be called Aunties, Uncles & Waiting! My guy's breakfast burger - brie, bacon, fried egg and something else was wolfed down so fast I thought he might choke. I took my time with my omelette - generous amount of goat's cheese and roasted peppers with challah toast. We also ordered an extra side of bacon, for the price I think the order was more than generous.  I have two complaints about the food (other than the waiting): firstly, neither of the potato sides were good - the potato salad was more like a dijon salad with potatoes and the hash browns were overly salted; secondly, my omelette was swimming in juice.   A&U is a decent place, but I don't understand the hype. It's good but it's not 1 hour long lineup good."}
{"text":"Aunties and uncles are definitely one of the best brunch places in Toronto - the taste of the food amazed me at my first vist, especially their KETCHUP - yes, the damn KETCHUP. The homemade sun-dried tomato ketchup have always stunned me. Also, I love their club sandwich. The chicken breasts are properly grilled, and severed along with the crispy toasts. It makes my mouth watered just by thinking about it.  However, there are lots of things this place could have improved - their services are slow, which I understand since it's always busy. If you want to have a visit to Aunties & Uncles on a Saturday/Sunday morning, you better come here really early because of the usual lineups. The lineups can make you wait for more than an hour, which is really painful especially when it's winter. I'd suggest the restaurant owner to design a proper waiting area. As for the people who want to try Aunties & Uncles, I'd suggest you to just order takeouts. Also, the diner is really tiny, and the restaurant usually has a really greasy smell (although some people would argue that the smell is how a \"traditional\" brunch place supposes to be). Also, some of the food options are not that great. For example, their bacon is way too salty and greasy. It is not a good idea to have that kind of food in the early morning."}
{"text":"Arriving at Auntie's and Uncles kitschy little store approximately 10 minutes before opening I was glad to see that there was no line - given some of the reviews I expected something like Dottie's True Blue Café with people lined up 20 deep at opening.  As the doors opened up myself and two others made our way in and were allowed to sit \"wherever we like\" - approximately ten minutes later every single seat in the place was full and a small line had formed.  Handed a menu as I walked in I was oddly seated for nearly 15 minutes before orders were taken and coffee offered because two of the employees were actually sitting at a table eating their breakfast - not exactly professional, especially for a place so busy.  Once orders were finally placed I have to admit I liked AU's  design and concept - incredibly fresh food cooked right in front of the customers and a set menu plus daily specials based on the cook's whim.  Coffee was served quickly once my server finally finished up my meal, but unfortunately the only sweetener options were splenda and plain sugar - call me crazy but I quite like Equal.  Coffee was adequate but certainly not designer - a relatively acidic blend no better than Tim Horton's - and refills were slow.  Arriving only ten minutes after I placed my orders, both plates were brought together and both were piping hot and fresh from the kitchen.  Having spent the duration of the wait discussing the irony of my neighboring diners being Torontonian basketball fans and myself an Ohioan hockey fan I had to laugh when my neighbor stated that I \"ordered too much\" and that there was \"no way I'd be able to eat all that\" - he didn't even know about Nadege.  Having selected one sweet and one savory, a \"special\" and a \"menu item\" I figured I'd have a nice sampling of what Auntie's kitchen could do.  Beginning first with the sweet special, Banana Ricotta Pancakes with cinnamon, fruit, and pure maple syrup - these were excellent.  Having had ricotta pancakes once in the past and being largely impressed by the moist pockets of cheese but not sold on the cake texture, Auntie's and Uncles offering was vastly superior to the last incarnation with a light and airy dough laden with caramelized cinnamon bananas and perfectly complimented by the somewhat bitter yet bold maple syrup.  While I'd have preferred the syrup warm this small oversight didn't hurt the dish and I was glad the kitchen didn't make the choice to slather the dish with butter like so many others do.  The second dish, a menu \"savory\" that I'd read rave reviews of honestly didn't fare as well as the pancakes.  Entitled Grilled Brie with Pear Chutney and Walnuts on Challah, I honestly found the dish relatively lacking in flavor.  While the bread was beautiful with a mild sweetness coming through the buttery grilled exterior, the pears were largely flavorless (strange given the season,) and the timid brie was vastly overwhelmed by the bitter/earthy walnuts.  Well prepared, no doubt, and improved with the addition of some of the syrup from my pancakes, but definitely not something I'd order again - a sad statement considering my love of brie, pears, and grilled cheese in general.  All told I guess I just don't get the fuss about Auntie's and Uncles aside from the \"cult appeal.\"  While the pancakes were indeed excellent, the fact that they were a menu special does not assure them to be available daily and the overall \"aloofness\" of the servers was rather off-putting.  Mediocre coffee, an average sandwich, a limited menu (and don't even get me started on the bathroom)...while I don't regret the trip and mostly did enjoy my breakfast at Auntie's and Uncles, in hindsight I'd have rather spent my money on some more of Nadege's delicacies."}
{"text":"This is a good brunch spot.  It gets super busy on weekends, though.  People line up even before the place opens.  That's what I did to ensure a spot.  The service in here is good and the wait staff pretty chill.  I do like the food, and the only reason this place doesn't get a five star is I don't think the food necessarily justifies the waits.  They definitely serve a mean brunch, but I have had just as good without the wait."}
{"text":"I went a million years ago and loved it -- had the banana pancakes I think but the next few visits I either got thee too late or the line was too long so I haven't gotten back The house is amazing  It actually a converted house! So freakin cool"}
{"text":"Me and a friend stayed in Toronto for a few days late last year at the Planet Traveller hostel just a few doors away. We were recommended A&Us by the hostel staff for breakfast. When we arrived it was packed and we were put on a wait list and recommended the coffee shop round the corner whilst we waited. A lovely coffee later we sat and ordered the grilled cheese, mine with 'pea-meal' ham, tomatoes and Canadian cheese with hash browns on the side. It was truly one of the most satisfying meals I've ever had and we agreed me would - and did - return before we left the city. Obviously you worry that the second time wouldn't be as nice but it was even better. Jam packed and generous it was a great start to the day and I miss them dearly. I would not that the staff are perhaps not as warm and welcoming as they maybe could, and should, be but the atmosphere was great, the coffee lovely and the food unforgettable."}
{"text":"Got the banana oatmeal pancake for take-out. Around $8 I believe. It's quite delicious! And I think it has some cheese in it too which is an interesting twist. Personally I like those light fluffy soft pancakes over the more dough-like consistency. Nonetheless, still yummy!"}
{"text":"For me, brunch is one of those meals that you will always be ravenously hungry for, which usually makes it all the more delicious. I mean, if you wanted to just wake up and fill your belly, that's why breakfast exists. By nature, brunch is something you stand in line for, something you anticipate throughout the week, something...poetic.  I came to Aunties and Uncles with high hopes and great expectations given the numerous positive reviews. Being the sneaky dickens that I am, I came later in the afternoon on a weekday in an effort to avoid the notorious line. After being seated immediately and perusing the menu, I decided to order the Pan Bagnat -- described as a sandwich of arugula, cucumber, sundried tomatoes, red onion, olives and tomatoes on warm focaccia -- with a side of hash browns.   Despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't very busy, the food took forever to come out. After the lengthy wait, I eagerly bit into my sandwich only to find that the bread was cold, hard and dry, and the contents seemed to be devoid of all flavour. Where was the tang from the olives and the mild spiciness of the arugula? Where was the mellow sweetness of the tomato and the bite from the red onion? I pondered these questions thoughtfully as I continued to basically stab myself in the mouth while consuming my lethal weapon of a sandwich. My face was literally wounded and sore from the fact that the bread was so dry, but my hunger urged me to continue. To top it all off, \"service\" consisted of a guy in a Canadian tuxedo shuffling around and throwing stuff down on the table.    I left Aunties and Uncles with emptiness in my belly and in my soul. I will continue to reserve my weekend mornings to stand in line elsewhere."}
{"text":"First started using yelp on my latest trip to Toronto, this place looked sweet from the reviews. And everyone who raved about this place was right. Tight little joint, small menu , with what I would say award winning flavors. Sorta hipster, but I'm alright with that. Old School espresso machine , eclectic decor made for a relaxing late morning breakfast. Glad I went on a Monday because I hear later in the week the waits can be 30-40 mins.  I believe it because everything they do looks great and the space isn't all that big.   All in all I gave it 5 stars because our server, kindly led us to do some exploring and told us about cool places to go where it is not full tourists. So thumbs up to you dude!"}
{"text":"My east coast cousins were in town and we all wanted some grub; I think Aunties & Uncles was a fitting choice!   I ordered the Aunties & Uncles club, which is essentially a BLT with cheese and aioli. It was tasty but nothing overly amazing. The waitress didin't make eye contact and generally seemed uninterested in everything we said.   We asked to split the bills in two right at the beginning and she told us to tell her again at the end. When we were done our meal, another waiter plopped our bill down (not separated) and told us it was too late to split it.  Despite having liked my meal I am not sure I'll be coming back here again. You see I am impatient! I understand why there are wait times at The Black Hoof, it's food is unique, exotic and AMAZING. But brunch is well, brunch and with no real stand out on the menu I didn't think i was worth the 25 minute wait... on a wednesday afternoon!  Oh well at least the prices were super cheap."}
{"text":"Search for the best brunch places in Toronto and this place definitely comes up.  The long line-up was the biggest turn off for me.The service is really slow too.  The interior,although very cramped, has a very warm feeling to it which I liked. The food was good but nothing exceptional.I ordered an omelette with a side of potatoes and I enjoyed it.Although I did not feel there was anything that made it special or I would want to eat it again.  Overall, a decent brunch place if you have time in your hands to wait in the line-up."}
{"text":"If you don't want to wait in line for 20 minutes to an hour on the weekends you MUST COME WHEN THEY OPEN. If you don't and complain about the line up after 9 you don't know what's up.   Yes, they are a little snobby here but the price, food quality, and quantity is so worth it. There aren't a lot of places in the area where you can get brunch for two for 20 bucks that's actually good. I've been here about 5 times and the only time I noticed a drop in quality was when it was super busy on a Saturday.   The breakfast tacos are filling and flavourful - house made chorizo sauce under perfectly scrambled eggs - yum!   People complaining about the staff or how they need more staff or whatever clearly don't get it. Aunties and Uncles has a great business model and are always busy so why would they change anything? I don't personally expect to go to a restaurant and be treated like god's gift to humanity - just as long as the food is good and the price is right."}
{"text":"Went here around 10 am on a Sunday morning with a group of 5 friends and waited about 30 minutes for a table. I got the breakfast tacos with half salad and half home fries. The tacos were pretty tasty and I loved the spice mixture on the home fries. I've waited less time for better brunch food though."}
{"text":"Funky art on the wall - simple dinner set up but very hip vibe.  I tried the French toast -  and it's was rocking, not to soggy in the middle - bread was great and right amount of cinnamon.. Had to do the side of bacon...;)"}
{"text":"You want to know the secret to getting into this secret Brunch society?  Either you come right before they open, or right before they close.  Yes, that's the motherloving secret.  If you come at 2:30pm (they close at 3), if you get there at 2:40, that's perfect.  The prices are great. The food is fantastic, and the ambience is fun and kitschy."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Aunties & Uncles. I love breakfast, and A&U is well-known in Toronto as a key breakfast joint, but due to its popularity, there's often lines out the door. If you're impatient like me, you'll look for an alternative, but I gotta say... it is worth the wait. If you like high quality for low $$$ then come here. Sister had the croque monsier, my mom had a grilled cheese, and I had french toast. All three were great and service was solid. Will return, if i'm up early enough to beat the rush!"}
{"text":"Horrible wait negated a yummy but fatty meal. 2 hours total meal time, including a mere 10 minutes of eating. If you enjoy queuing, becoming famished, then wolfing down really heavy food with lots of butter, oil, cheese, and egg yolks, then Aunties & Uncles is the place for you.  Toronto foodies: PLEASE STOP ENCOURAGING THEIR SLOW SERVICE. Thank you.  Gory details about the wait: Arrived at 12:00pm Saturday, queue of about 9 people, 4 parties ahead of us. Seated at 12:45. Ordered immediately. Only 3 tables were served while we were waiting for ours. Food arrived at 1:20pm. Finished eating at 1:30pm. Yeah, we were hungry after the 1 hour 20 minute wait and devoured our food. Waited again for the bill. Waited again for change. Finally left at 1:50.  The food was good but not amazing. You can get similarly good tasting fare elsewhere for much less time invested. You know, by going to restaurants that serve you food shortly after you arrive.  We ate:  A Belgian waffle (the crispy Brussels kind, not the soggy circle Liège kind) and it was a bit soft, too doughy, but the flavor was good. You can probably make better at home.  Omelet cooked in heavy butter with Bocconcini cheese, spinach, caramelized onions, diced tomato. This was one wet omelet. The juice ran out all over the plate and made the otherwise crispy buttered toast soggy. The potato salad was overwhelmed by vinegar.   Grilled cheese sandwich of heavily buttered sesame bread slices, egg, peameal bacon, and caramelized onion.  We paid: about $25.  This food is HEAVY. It's possible that anything cooked with this much fat will taste good. (Try buttering your arm and eating it while you wait in the queue.)  Apparently it takes 35 minutes to cook the above. Maybe they like to wait to do prep after seating customers? Maybe they only have 1 working grill space? Maybe the chef is just insanely slow?  The waitresses were nice but took forever to bus the tables. There  were only perhaps 14 tables total. Small place. I would not call it cozy, since the chairs are cheap and uncomfortable. It seemed most people knew that they'd be waiting, and apparently wanted to contribute to other people waiting, so they stayed to read a newspaper, book, or just chatting for 10 - 20 minutes after finishing eating."}
{"text":"I just went to A & U for an early weekday lunch and feel like I should be writing a review, even though I don't have anything much different to add than what previous posters have said...  What I can emphasize is that if you have the chance to go at an off peak time on a nice day it's pretty unlikely to disappoint... very relaxed, lots of space, capable service.  As for the food, the sandwich special I had (challah bread, egg, peameal, avocado, cheese, I forget the oil/seasoning they used) was excellent and more than filling.  Personally I wasn't blown away by the side dill potato salad, for me it was ever so slightly soggy but good otherwise... maybe I'm just not such a fan of potato salad.  Very good value.  Sandwich and potato salad side - $8.50, coffee $1.50, plus tax and tip."}
{"text":"Showed up on Sunday morning to clusters of folks lingering outside, looking hep. Turns out they were waiting for the privilege of eating at Aunties and Uncles. The wait is (really, really) long, and you feel as lucky as a liver donee when they call your name. Brunch was superb, and the Canadiana decor kept me entertained while our meals were being cooked (within plain view, I might add).  Obligatory Title Pun: RELATIVELY speaking, Aunties and Uncles is a great choice.  Menu Readability: Single pager lists the essentials.  Need to mention: Have a little something to eat before you go. Seriously, the wait is that long.  What this place teaches me about myself: I am willing and able to wait for eons just so I don't have to prepare my own breakfast."}
{"text":"Cute little mom and pop vibe on college street. Weekends expect to wait 30mins to get a seat. Sandwiches are great but a bit pricey. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"Ohhhh.....brunch. One of the greatest amalgamations of two words and always delicious, especially if you have it at Aunties & Uncles. It's gotta be the cutest little brunch place tucked away on Lippincott with a great outdoor space and eccentric decor.   I've walked by during peak hours (think Saturday and Sunday hangover mealtime) and the lines are just ridiculous. Bonus, you'll be able to hang with a bunch of hipsters out front and look cool (umm...yeah). Seriously though, if you can make it here during the week or at off hours, you likely won't have to wait, and may even score a coveted bench on their patio area, which is lovely in the summer.   Friendly service, and their signature potato salad that they serve up as a side is really worth trying. Also, try the breakfast tacos and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning for brunch and WOW! We were lucky enough to live in the area and catch the first seating but by 10 minutes after they opened, there was a line about 4 parties deep. And I can definitely say this is for a good reason.  We ordered the breakfast tacos, the cinnamon french toast and a side of the home fries. The breakfast tacos were the bomb; a palm-sized pocket of egg, beans, chorizo and melted cheese wrapped together in a warm corn tortilla is hard to beat. Every bite was better than the last with the exception of the last one when sadness creeps in. The french toast was tasty as well with strong notes of cinnamon and a dense texture that soaked up maple syrup really well. The home fries on the side were delicious with parts that were fluffy and light and other parts that were crispy. The dish came with a side of spicy aoili that brought out the flavor and texture of the dish.  Will definitely be back to try some of their other items. Pro tip: arrive early or expect to wait! We got there 15 minutes before opening and waited (they have cute, little chairs to make the wait a little more pleasant) and we still barely got a seat."}
{"text":"I LOVE breakfast. Just this morning the first words out of my mouth were: \"I want to go to a pancake house.\" I commit to breakfast. I am married to breakfast. Love, love, love breakfast. When in Toronto recently, I got to have a day of doing exactly what I wanted and what I wanted was breakfast.  Like Zingerman's Deli in Ann Arbor and Edzo's Burgers in Evanston, Aunties and Uncles isn't just awesome; it is COLLEGE TOWN awesome. Let's start with getting there. Aunties and Uncles is off College Street and is tucked around the corner a little bit so, if you are parking, you should drive around the block and park on the street. There are also some parking lots as an option. I am emphasizing the parking because, when you are hungry and on your way to breakfast, not finding parking is like not having oxygen. I was hungry when I started driving to Aunties and Uncles, but by my fourth time around the block looking for JUST ONE parking spot, I was making wide declarations like: THEY BETTER HAVE THE BEST CINNAMON FRENCH TOAST I'VE EVER EATEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE. (The capital letters were necessary.) Planning and a little luck have a lot to do with a well-executed breakfast adventure.  Like most college towns, the area has the feeling of oh-whomever-lives-here-does-NOT-know-how-to-do-their-own-laundry-yet. Everything is just worn down and grimy. There are several bars with Jager Meister signs in the window. Also, places named \"Fred's Bread\" and \"Cloak and Dagger\" are here. Oh college towns, never change.  Aunties and Uncles is simply one of those places only college towns can produce. Years of scrambling, batter-making and warming processed animal products makes this kind of layered yumminess that looks kind of gross on the surface, but is predictably wonderful.  At Aunties and Uncles, there were vintage kitchen goods, signs, and tins. Also, LOTS of hipsters. No one had an article of clothing on that was made in this century. Shoes maybe, but not clothes.  The morning I was there, they had no waffles, but did have blueberry pancakes. It made me wonder what they put in their waffles if the components are SO different than pancakes that they couldn't offer them. The french toast was incredible and the coffee was exactly what I needed. Aunties and Uncles is cash only, so bring those loonies and toonies with you when you come.  As I was driving away from Aunties and Uncles, I saw lots of graffiti and a couple of moose (mooses? meeses?) on balconies. Each house looked like it was having a garage sale because there was so much debris, although no one was awake yet. If you come early to Aunties and Uncles, you should be able to get a table because no college student would fight you for it. They won't be up for hours after you are done. This is one of the primary advantages of old age. Take advantage of it."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast and lunch.  Great service, Great food.  Does get busy on weekends so get their early for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was ok. The service was pretty bad. Sat with an empty water glass most of the meal. Even after I asked for more water, it never came.  The server found time to text on her phone, but not fill my water."}
{"text":"This place rocks the casbah. The breakfast tacos are awesome and the burgers are fantastic. Service was great. Really fun vintage decor. If it weren't in fucking Toronto, I'd go here all the time."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  I ordered a Belgian waffle with pears and I was not disappointed.  This waffle tasted unique - a bit of cinnamon in it and a lot of egg, almost like French Toast.  Staff is responsive and really friendly, and you gotta love the retro shabby chic decor.  I would heartily recommend for a Toronto brunch.    I would've given it more than four stars, but five stars would have to have been a perfect breakfast (awarded only to L'Avenue in Montreal for me!)"}
{"text":"If you expect to wait less than 30 minutes for a seat at Aunties & Uncles you'll be grumpy and disappointed. Just accept the fact that you'll be waiting a MINIMUM of 30-60 minutes and you'll be a much happier brunch attendee. Just be thankful that they have a spacious awning and benches for you to sit on while you wait, unlike some other popular brunch places. Also, if you're a large group (4+) please don't come to Aunties because there's hardly any room for you.   Now that those sobering facts are out of the way, let's talk about the actual food. I ordered the scrambled eggs combo with hash browns and toast. The toast was of the challah variety with sesame seeds on top but it wasn't 'sweet' egg bread the way I like it. It was semi-buttered but an extra bowl of butter came our way so I was happy about that. The hash browns were actually just boiled and fried potatoes and sweet potatoes and they were SUPER good. The scrambled eggs were poorly cooked (kind of soggy) but I was so famished by the time our food came that it nearly went unnoticed.   With only two people sweating up a storm in the kitchen I was surprised how quickly our food came. I love the washrooms in this place - the one upstairs is literally an original \"apartment bathroom\" with a curtain, bathmat and other things that make it seem like you're in someone's apartment.   Get here early to avoid the dreaded peak brunch line! You might \"only\" have to wait 30 minutes! Bring a book and make sure it's something by Dave Eggers, Miranda July or David Sedaris so you'll fit in with the other hipsters in line. Faux eyewear recommended."}
{"text":"You will definitely need to wait for a table here but I think the wait is worth it - at least if you don't have to stand outside in the rain or snow. Portions here are large! I had an omelette with sauteed butternut squash, leeks, kale & Harvarti - absolutely delicious! Loved the Potato Salad too - a perfect mix of dill, Dijon and spices.   The place has a old school, vintage feel with posters and artwork from different decades and mismatched chairs. Cash only!"}
{"text":"There is a line of about 15 people and a family of 3 (one being a child) was seated on a table for 6. A couple has been seating on a table for 4 for over an hour after finishing their meal. There is no meal that justifies their unpreparedness for seating logistics. Seriously."}
{"text":"Went in thinking this place would be amazing and it turned out just good. My omlet was really heavy on everything but the egg and the challah toast was good  but retrospectively I think I much prefer it un-toasted, savor all its softness. Coffee was solid and the potatoes salad was unexpectedly great.  My wife's banana oatmeal pancakes were incredible. If it wasn't so hard to get a table I might go back."}
{"text":"The day I learned I was within walking distance of this constantly name-dropped establishment, I had to prepare myself for the day I actually could get a seat for a weekend brunch.  It was glorious. It was kitsch and greasy and delicious and worth the wait and made me realize that Toronto is just that much more amazing for being home to Aunties and Uncles.  And then I learned that it is open during the week from 9 to 3. And I just can't get enough.  I only order one thing because I can't fathom not ordering it, so when I say that the grilled brie and pear chutney on challah is simply beyond, it is. It's beyond. Why would anyone ever order anything else?  Oh, and always order the hash browns.  I do have experience with ordering a variety of beverages, consisting of juice and coffee. Coffee has free refills, hurray, and the juice is always delicious but expensive for such a small glass. I personally recommend the water.  Anyway, the wait kind of sucks on the weekends, but if you can afford to go another time during the week, go then. But not all of you, because I really don't want to wait outside in December.  Oh, right, and the whole reason you want to go there to begin with is that it has a really awesome vintage kitsch motif. Check it out. It's not pretentious, it's fun. It kind of makes you want to pretend you live in the 70s, are roughly eight years old, have a shaggy bowl cut and a striped sweater tucked into your bell bottoms, in a completely nostalgic way.  And remember: it's cash only."}
{"text":"Amazing, well priced, and delicious. I had the banana oatmeal pancakes which were quite possibly some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I would recommend this place to anyone who will listen."}
{"text":"Being over 30 and not to be found in tight pants or being in love with the 80s, I ended up resisting the urge to hit Sneaky Dee's.  Just didn't feel like I was cool enough (and my stomach isn't in quite the fighting shape it used be).  And I'm ok with that.  For one, I felt myself getting even cooler cool points by going down the street and getting my breakfast at the charming hipster oasis Aunties and Uncles.  Impossibly perfect potatoes, comforting coffee and eggs to call home about -- it was all working here to make for a brilliant start to the day.  Say yes to the Breakfast Taco!  Service was casually awesome and even though I had to listen to our neighbor blah blah blah about her skinny dipping escapades in Europe for most of the meal, our outdoor picnic table setting was... lovely.  Yes, lovely.  One of the top five Toronto meals."}
{"text":"Great brunch place. The staff is friendly and the bartender keeps the drinks coming. They are very chatty. We visited from NYC and the staff exchanged stories. The pancakes are a must."}
{"text":"Long line to get in but we sat relatively quickly. Wait staff was nice but the food took a long time to be served. The food was ok- I had the breakfast tacos- but nothing worth coming back for. Not sure what the line up and the hype is about."}
{"text":"One of the few places my cousin and I could find open for brunch during the weekday (or even during the holidays).  First thing you notice coming close to this place is the savoury aroma in the air of good eats.  So just follow your nose if you're around bathurst and college.  It's a quaint little place with helpful staff and friendly atmosphere.  But seriously elbow room only and little to no waiting room - so if you don't have the patience to wait outside in Toronto winters (or if you don't own a $500 winter jacket like almost everyone else...I digress in my jealousy) I'd suggest walking along.  We should up at around 10:30 and waited about 20 minutes for a 2 person table.  Any larger parties beyond 4 you could tell would require a little more patience.  Both ordered the breakfast pocket with hash browns (and an extra side of bacon for my cousin's inquisitive palate).  Breakfast pocket consisted of scrambled eggs, melted cheddar, peameal bacon, slice of tomato, & dijon mustard on a focaccia bun.  It honestly wasn't a pretty picture, so the tastebuds were in for an unexpected treat.  Incredibly savoury and really everything you could want in a breakfast sandwich.  I'd also suggest adding a bit of their homemade ketchup to the mix for an extra bite to the experience.  The hash browns were quite good, but nothing spectacular.  Probably because it was a bit misleading.  We were expecting the crispy fried kind, but they were simple rustic potatoes on the stove top.  All in all, some good eats, definitely worth the try and better than your average \"eggs and bacon\" kinda place."}
{"text":"Great food, Banana Oatmeal pancake and fresh fruit very amazing. However poor service, only had one waiter during busy breakfast hours. She was overwhelmed and it showed in her attitude, it's not her fault. I think if she had help she would be able to interact with the customer better. Overall I would visit again, just can't be in a hurry its a place you have to take you time."}
{"text":"Very very very slow. Got here at 940am and finished the meal at 1140. The food became not as impressive when the service is so compromised"}
