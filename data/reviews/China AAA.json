{"text":"I came here with my friend who had been here before. I had Gen. Tsao chicken which was on special for $6.99 and a spicy yellowtail roll. Portions were huge. The spicy yellowtail roll was twice as large as usual.  The food was fresh, tasty & well spiced. I rarely eat American style Chinese food, but eat authentic Asian food most days. This was a wonderful change of pace.  I'll be back and I'll recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"We have ordered from this place several times and this place is wonderful. I never have had a bad dish from here and I love the noodles. Also, the driver who delivered the food to me and my husband was very polite. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Delivery took an hour and a half! The potstickers were deep fried and small. The general Sao chicken was soft and chewy. Go to China Bistro way better food"}
{"text":"I don't generally write reviews, but this is one time I am. We ordered our food (over $50). We placed the order at 5:55 pm. At 6:40 the online application said it was on its way. At 7:34 still no food. So my son calls to find out they are just now making our order over 90 minutes later. Needless to say we canceled our order. Horrible service. Instead we went down the street to chopsticks and had our order in 15 min."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here dozens of times. Every other order there is a mistake; nothing to stop me from ordering again, but white rice instead of brown, not enough sauce, forgot the ginger, etc. This last time... Will be the LAST time I order from them! Horrible customer service, the woman on the phone blatantly told me I was a liar when I said I had used the Yelp email coupon for free delivery and even showed the delivery guy what my total should be in confirmation as opposed to what the receipt he wanted me to sign said. When you give your order over phone, they barely speak English so often have to repeat multiple times and when you question, she walks away from phone or says ok and then gets order wrong. Delivery guy speaks no English either. It's so frustrating! But to treat a customer so blatantly ugly is just inexcusable.         Oh yes, she tried to call me back and say she made a mistake, only after eat24/Yelp called them and told them to call me, but too little too late... You can't call customers liars and be rude and expect them to be ok with it!!!!! Epic fail by China aaa....better off ordering from somewhere else and getting what you ordered every time!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and the food came very fast and the delivery man was very nice but the food was horrible. I got the curry, I don't know what kind of meat it was. It was chewy and tough and tasted very wrong. I also ordered a California roll and tuna roll and both rolls were very salty and very small. Will never try this place again."}
{"text":"As a Las Vegas regular, my family and I have made it somewhat of a tradition to eat at China AAA.  It's not necessarily what you would call a classy restaurant; however, its the PERFECT place to eat if you want an authentic Chinese meal for an unbeatable price. They have a large variety of plates with excellent lunch specials for everyone. This restaurant has it all; fresh food, great service and generous portions at an awesome price. If you like Chinese food you HAVE to try it.  :D"}
{"text":"Been ordering take out here a few times now, and I must say, I really like how fast they are on the delivery.  I love the sauteed veggies (both broccoli and spinach), Add that with some noodles like the house Lo Mein and you'll be a happy camper.  The boyfriend is super fond of the mongolian beef.  Will be ordering take out from here on the regular :)"}
{"text":"I eat or order here for delivery at least 3 or 4 times a week. Fast food and friendly staff. Sushi and bento box are also on the menu. My favorite has to be the Dynamite or Las Vegas roll."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Everything that we ordered was blah. I can't believe that this place averages 4 stars. Yelp reviews just lost a whole lot of credibility. The best part of our meal was the fortune cookie. The spring rolls were mushy. The sushi didn't look or taste fresh. The noodles in the chicken lo mein were decent but the chicken tasted sour. The chicken teriyaki was bland and the recipe needs an overhaul. We all felt ill after the meal.  About 5 hours after the meal the person in our party that ate the chicken teriyaki threw up - classic food poisoning. Never again."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, clean environment, spotless bathrooms. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I order here all the time mostly lunch but at least once a week. We call and ask a question, they just agree with everything we say on the order for an individual meal and I go to verify and she says well.... It's more for a family?  Like you understood everything I just said to you and knowingly try to get my money for something I clearly wasn't ordering. Then as I'm asking to clear it up if there is an individual meal or not there's all of a sudden a language barrier and she sits the phone down and never comes back as I hear customers being rang up. This is poor service. Being so rude one time will lose my business."}
{"text":"Love the lunch specials that they offer.  It's a great price for the amount of food you get, and it's always delicious.  They have no problem with substitutions or special orders which is nice too."}
{"text":"Update: I am now officially super stoked about China AAA. Nobody does it better, without charging you $100. This place is just downright amazing. There is really nothing more to say. Just go get some and find out for yourselves. :) P.S. Try the Taro slushy. Purple actually has a flavor, and it's not grape!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Driver forgot half my order and he had to come back because he left it in his car. Who knows what he did to it. Portions are small. Disappointed in their customer service."}
{"text":"Good service and quick for family take out night. I like the sushi roll options. The menu is pretty typical for a Chinese take out delivery place but it is consistent and good. The family dinner options are great and economical for a large family like ours. I am a bit put off by how busy they always are but I guess that's also a good thing for them."}
{"text":"The food is great! I especially love that they deliver. So hard to find someone who delivers sushi and it is good sushi too. I absolutely love the sushi burrito and volcano roll. That calamari is awesome and the pot stickers and spring rolls are good as well. Great price and great service they are always quick."}
{"text":"I can't even try it Because when I got it to go it was a mess and I actually needed to get another plate to eat it. All my husband wanted while in the hospital was this. Not to mention I had to already go back in to get chopsticks and forks. So sad:( the food is fine, but not worth the mess."}
{"text":"Tried this place when we were over in Henderson.  It's a typical Chinese restaurant but also offers a variety of sushi which was nice. Food was good and the staff was friendly.  Walked in and placed an order and I was out the door in about 15 minutes.   When back around there we willing again."}
{"text":"Just found any random Chinese Restaurant because I needed delivery, and I scored! Their food is delicious and there portions were huge! Fast, friendly, and bang for my buck. I'll be getting dinner from them once a week. So yummy!"}
{"text":"I wanted Shrimp Egg Foo Young, and they told me that they do not make the gravy anymore. So I ordered it anyway and it was horrible.  I'm from New Jersey across the bridge from NYC and have never heard that before.  I mean, how can you make this meal without the gravy?  How?"}
{"text":"I've been here about five times and every time everything is perfect. I'm picky and I'm vegetarian and I don't like fried food so they work with me. The portions are huge for the price. They do a lot of takeout and a lot of to go orders. Sometimes there's quite a few people waiting to pick up food but they are still extremely fast. The dining room is small but clean with an Asian theme. The employees are nice. :)"}
{"text":"The food is yummy and plentiful. We ordered mooshu pork and there was enough for five hungry people! We added chicken lettuce wraps and they were very tasty. In the end we took home as much food as we ate. This location seemed to have a lot of people grabbing takeout. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love that they deliver sushi, and it is really good sushi!  My favorite is the bento box for $8.99, you get a sushi roll, salad, 2 egg rolls and an entree as well.  So much food, so yummy, a great deal!"}
{"text":"When you grow up in LA or San Francisco you have a specific idea of how Chinese food is.  This is not it, they put way too much sauce or too less, and tend to over cook.  Do not order through grub hub, we've had so many issues doing that.  They're really nice people, but that doesn't fix the food."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area a month ago and wanted Chinese and figured I'd try here. The delivery time was amazing ! I ordered at 7:36 and the gentleman was here at 7:50! The food was delicious as well. Loved the potstickers and the house fried rice and the fact they use huge shrimps in the fried rice! Definitely ordering my Chinese from here for now on"}
{"text":"Great place! Food was good, price was even better and the servings are huge. Delivery was early. I highly recommend China AAA to anyone."}
{"text":"this place is definitely my go to if i want chinese food delivered to me fast. i absolutely love this place. they have a wide variety of food you can choose from and they always deliver their food hot and ready to eat. their customer service is great too, i ordered two beef chow fun and they were out so they gave me two other items for free! what a deal! my favorite dish to get there is definitely the spicy chicken wings, if you haven't tried them out yet you're missing out! china aaa you're my favorite chinese fast food place!"}
{"text":"Got the family pack last time I went, everything was really good. The portions were big and it tasted great. Very happy with the entire experience.  I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"We moved and had to find a new Chinese place to order from. Everything we've tried has been great! Great value and they are always so fast! I'm glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Food is good, especially when you want delivery.  They are very nice and super fast!"}
{"text":"Dirty place. Received citations from Health Department in the past. Was closed before and open with this new name. China AAA. Be careful"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and after an hour wait the order was wrong. Called to report it and they argued that it wasn't wrong. They finally agreed to make the correct item and bring it to us. After 45 more minutes, still no replacement food. Called to cancel and they offered to make us a free roll next time. There will not be a next time. Way to many other Chinese delivery restaurants to ever try this place again."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese for this area, solid. Their spicy chicken wings are some of the best though. They also have some pretty decent sushi. I usually order delivery and have not really had any problems."}
{"text":"First time ordering food great 10 out of would come again ... when I walked in I saw ppl eating Bento sushilols good"}
{"text":"Loved it! Absolutely loved it! Placed an order for three lunch entrées to be delivered to my work. They arrived in just about half the time I was quoted. I literally had my food on the table fork in hand and was eating in under 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Fast. I'd recommend The general tso's was crispy and decent flavor. The honey walnut shrimp was a little mayo-y for me."}
{"text":"Great food , have ordered here a few times usually dine in. But todays delivery driver was super rude. Basically shoved the bags of food into my wifes arms. Things like this cause me to spend my money else where. The food was already paid for but i guess i wasent waiting on the porch so the driver could toss it out and go.delivery was 10mins ago"}
{"text":"Great box lunch, tasty and plentiful. Good service, casual dining in and fast takeout."}
{"text":"https://www.ktnv.com/news/dirty-dining/roaches-at-repeat-offender-china-aaa-and-more-on-dirty-dining  I loved coming here but will now go elsewhere due to their continued issues w/roaches. Ownership may want to rename the place to China FFF since they are far from being an A."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Chinese restaurant close to our hotel near the South Point Hotel and Casino. We found this on Yelp and decided to try it. We hit a home run this time. We had the sweet and sour pork lunch special and the cashew chicken lunch special and a small wor wonton soup. All were excellent. We had leftovers on everything so I won't have to figure out lunch for the next two days. We will definitely return to try other things. The fried rice that was part of the lunches had more flavor than many we've had over the years. All in all, a winner!"}
{"text":"For fast food greasy Chinese food....this is not bad, as long as your expectation is that.  Definitely stick with the Chinese options. They offer Thai and Sushi dishes. Not a fan of those.  I ordered:  Orange Chicken (really good- Lots of chicken!)  General Chicken (really good - lots of chicken!)  Sweet and Sour - (sauce came on the side - wasn't bad, just ok)  Mongolian beef - better than expected  Lo mein - wasn't a fan, pass  Chicken Fried Rice - Good  Chicken Pad Thai - (Huge portion, lots of meat, just lacking spice and real flavor. Again, stick with the Chinese options)  Yellow Curry Chicken - Not good   Again, if you are looking for fast food, greasy, delivery option Chinese. Not bad, definitely not my favorite."}
{"text":"It is our first time here. We ordered the family meal for pick-up with pepper steak, shrimp lobster, fried rice  and egg drop soup. For about $30 with tax it was pretty good. We are impressed.  Good serving sizes. It was worth it. Egg drop soup was bland but the rest was pretty tasty in my opinion.  I didn't know it also comes with complimentary 2 egg roll, crab rangoon and 2 small tempura. The tempura  were tiny  LOL but I can't complain since they are just complimentary  :P  My order was served on time which is a big deal for me because I have ordered thru Yelp on a couple of places who couldn't meet the time promised. I mean, if you can't commit to Yelp pickup then don't offer it.  Anyway, we're  pleased with this little Chinese joint and we'll order again.  ***PS restaurant is very small, not cozy at all. I'm not sure about cleanliness. I try to observe that next time. Hopefully they are good at keeping everything clean."}
{"text":"I live Chinese food, but unfortunately, the Mongolian Beef I ordered had enough grease in it for about eight normal orders. There was literally a pool of it in the corners as I tilted the container."}
{"text":"I like Bento box set. Fried rice come together with box set so delicious.  I recommend don't order Mu Shu. Taste very salty. Again so salty, super salty!!  I don't know why so salty? I guess maybe Chef was crying when he cooking my order..."}
{"text":"First time ordering the food was so good and was earlier then expected and everything was still hot. Wonderful going to order from them again."}
{"text":"This is for China AAA your food is nasty of Write three and comments on here and you seem to go in there and and delete it but if I see is gone and will do it again the orange chicken it was dry no taste and show me how do you mess up chow mein  it smell Bad"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've visited this place and by \"a while\" I mean a year or two. They definitely added some things to their menu that attracted me to come today but oh how disappointing it was. I might have had high expectations for this place because their chicken wings appetizer and combination fried rice was to die for ... or it used to be anyway.   Ordered two bento boxes, one with beef broccoli and one with general tso. Both delicious but nothing past ordinary. I asked the server how much one order of rice can feed and she said one person so I ordered two and OMG! By my judgement it could have fed four people. Their rainbow roll sushi was generous in fish but it was tasteless and a bit dry.   We were the only ones there and had to flag the server more than once. The tables were sticky and one of the guys that worked there picked his nose and didn't wash his hands prior to touching things on the counter.   I probably wouldn't choose this place again even if I wanted sushi and Chinese food together."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service and reasonable prices. I ordered food for dine in. Service was quick- a little too quick. I had a cup of egg drop soup. It was served quick and hot. Almost still boiling which I think is great. The too quick was the entree arrived a minute or two behind the soup. I would have preferred to get the soup done before everything else arrived. I ordered the kung pao with shrimp, beef and chicken. It was very good and hot. I was disappointed there were only three shrimp. The were not very big either. Otherwise there was a lot of chicken and a fair amount of beef. For the most part it was a reasonable amount of food for the price. There was a ton of veggies which is good if you like that. I didn't need that much so there was a lot of celery left on my plate. Good food and hot, reasonable prices, a good option especially when you want delivery."}
{"text":"Booo! This visit wasn't as great as the other.  Ordered the sweet and sour shrimp and the cake noodle.  The shrimp in both dishes tasted like dirt.  I was so looking forward to the sweet and sour shrimp.  It looked good and there was a lot of shrimp and big pieces.  The service which is usually great have been poor the past couple of times we came.  The noodles seemed less than usual and in a smaller dish.  Our plates they gave us to eat off of was dessert plates.  You only get one mall bowl of rice to share.  So disappointed because this was my go to for the wor wonton soup.  I don't think I will be coming back after this visit.  My stomach is upset after eating here and I can still taste the dirty ness of the shrimp."}
{"text":"Good food. Fast delivery considering it was right at noon that I ordered. Hit the spot and will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Great service, lunch specials are great value and the fried rice super good. Impressive service is hard to find but our drinks were never empty and our food came really fast."}
{"text":"Really great Chinese food. My #1 just because it is closest. It is honestly not that great compared to the where I am from, but it is great for Vegas. I have had a hard time finding Chinese food here, maybe because of my expectations. As with most asian restaurants, they serve a variety of cuisine, but your best bet is sticking to the Chinese dishes.  My other favorite is NY Chinese food."}
{"text":"My number one go to place for Chinese food! I don't go anywhere else! You're always greeted with a friendly smile and they make an effort to talk to you and converse with you. The food is delicious and reasonably priced and the establishment is always so clean and smells fresh. Highly recommend this place and I will always keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Sushi Delivery order for dinner and it was WAYYY faster than I expected. Like magic!  Good sushi too :)"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered their lo mein noodles with chicken. Wasn't that great. Too much sauce was put in and was way too salty they also loaded it with garlic. Every bite I took had at least 15 little pieces of garlic. Also ordered an eel roll and the sauce was way too sweet. A miss on both.   But their simple fresh sushi rolls were pretty good. Spicy tuna was spicy, very cold though, felt like they froze their tuna before serving! But their yellowtail was perfect!   Portions were big so for the price I don't mind paying for their simple rolls or entrees, but if I really wanted good sushi or Chinese food I'd go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food is too salty and lots of MSG. The service is not good at all. I was ordering and the waitress just left to attend to something in the middle. Will not go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. It's like the Jimmy Johns of Chinese food!!! Always so quick, fresh and delicious!!! Great spot."}
{"text":"Meh. I hate giving bad reviews unless it's absolutely necessary. We ordered via grub-hub, delivery was quick. General Tso chicken was oily and bland. It wasn't the worst I've had but it wasn't good. Pad Thai was mediocre, again very bland and mushy in consistency. The curry beef didn't even smell like curry, the color was almost grayish, overcooked.  The seaweed salad was good, and the white rice was fluffy. Other than that, not a fan.  This may help some people: they DEFINITELY use MSG and a lot of it. I had a horrible allergic reaction not long after we ate dinner. Full body hives, itchy throat and the works :-( I wish Chinese restaurants would stop using it, it's so unhealthy and causes so many bad reactions.   There's too many good restaurants in town to revisit a bad one. Never again."}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly service. That bento box lunch is a winner! Spring rolls are perfect with just the right amount of crunch and the avocado rolls were great."}
{"text":"Got the chicken lettuce wraps and a couple hand rolled sushi. Not to crazy about the sushi... Lettuce wraps were really good, though! Would offer those again. I ordered take out, which got to my house pretty fast! Only about thirty minutes! Maybe next time I'll order something other than the sushi, I'm sure it'll be good."}
{"text":"Best delivery it always comes early and it tastes so good. I eat here almost everyday and their food always leaves me happy and full"}
{"text":"We were on this ice of town and we're craving Chinese food. Checked out yelp and this is where we ended up. The food was mediocre, we ordered combination fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, beef lo mein, and egg drop soup. The combination rice had large pieces of shrimp which we loved. But everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and decided to give this place a try as it was highly recommended to us. So glad we did!! We ordered the Crab Rangoon, Shrimp Fried Rice and Sesame Chicken. All were spectacular. Especially the Sesame Chicken. SO tasty. Absolutely go there. It's clean and very well maintained and the staff is super friendly. Did I mention the food was awesome?!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and even forgot I ordered from here before! It's like a totally different experience. Their delivery sucked when I last ordered but dining in I was impressed. The food was delicious and the staff friendly and restaurant clean even in the bathroom ++!  The order taker served me to my table and everything. Not sure what the change up was but I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch special with huge portions and egg drop soup!  We ended up taking half of the meal home.  Great price.  We have lived nearby for around a year and just now tried this hidden gem.  Close to Albertsons and worth the search.  I wasn't a fan of the salad dressing but everything else was delicious!"}
{"text":"Just to clarify this was a 4.5 Star Visit.  Looking to have some food delivered to the house while out driving around, decided we were close enough to stop by.  I am allergic to sesame oil/seeds. They use vegetable oil and only have sesame seeds on the sushi which is why they get 4.5 stars because my spicy tuna roll came out with sesame seeds which the promptly remade with absolutely no discussion.  We enjoyed: Miso Soup (L) $4.99 House Lo Mein (Beef, Chicken, & Shrimp) $7.25 Lunch Benton Box $8.95 Served 11a-4p 2 Sodas Total: $25.38 after tax. We will be ordering delivery very soon."}
{"text":"Really fast delivery - Food was piping hot - some strange things though... The chicken in the chicken chow mein was fried???? - WTF????? It wasn't terrible, but definitely not what I wanted. The walnut shrimp is GROSS - I order this everywhere and this one had a really sickly tangy sauce on it - YUCK . General chicken - their batter is kinda \"fluffy\" so there is a lot of fried dough before you get down to the little niblet of chicken. Ahi tuna nachos - NOT little chunks of diced fresh tuna but more like a tuna mashed up paste on the wontons. Fried rice was good - just reaaaaaly greasy - but still good flavor. Crab rangoon - fine. Wor wonton soup - fine."}
{"text":"I seach yelp and decide to give a try from this place , the sushi is really fresh ,the service is not bad. I think i will come back again ."}
{"text":"I always order sushi delivery from here and it's always excellent! Prices, delivery time, quality = two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I order here every time I want bomb ass egg rolls. You wouldn't think this hole in the wall Chinese spot would be ass good but it's definitely worth it. I love this little delivery place."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would.  This restaurant is the entire reason I finally got a Yelp account.  I should have run out of the restaurant when I saw the huge black curtain hiding whatever it is that goes on in that kitchen.  The food itself was oily.  Mediocre, at best.  I should have listened to my gut (no pun intended) when it told me to stop eating.  The morning after I ate here, I felt nauseous and light-headed.  Then a few hours later, I finally threw up.  An hour or two after THAT, I threw up again.  Turns out, my entire family got sick that day.  I reported the restaurant to the Southern Nevada Health District.  I'm so angry with this place that reporting them to the health department wasn't enough for me to feel avenged, so here I am, warning anyone who will listen to stay far, far away from here.  That is, unless you enjoy food poisoning-- I don't know your life."}
{"text":"When you're starving, everything tastes great!  Right?  Wrong!   I really wanted to have an amazing, satisfying Chinese \"go-to\" within minutes of my house but China AAA didn't \"bring it!\". We were a family of 6 tonight, we ordered kung pao chicken, chicken fried rice, lemon chicken, chow mein, potstickers and won ton soup.  The good:  won ton soup, kung pao chicken and chicken fried rice. The meh: chow mien The bad: pot stickers  The ugly:  lemon chicken I'll start with the good... The  wonton soup had great flavour, lots of vegetables, nice large juicy pieces of shrimp and meat, the kung pao chicken was very flavourful, had lots of fresh vegetables and peanuts (YUM) and with just enough heat that my kids didn't gag. The chicken fried  rice was also very tasty and had a decent amount of chicken and mixed vegetables without being too greasy, it's hard to go wrong with chicken fried rice IMO. The meh, you know, the chow mien was just ok, a decent filler, but thats it....Now for the bad... I did not like texture of the potstickers they were wrinkly, charred and stick to your teeth gummy.  And now for the ugly...the lemon chicken was breaded and pounded flat, reminiscent of school lunchroom chicken. I was looking for shape and texture and it wasn't there. There is an offer for free egg rolls with your order, Im not positive but I  believe the minimum amount is $25, but they won't give it to you unless you ask for it... The service was just average.  Bottom line:  the wonton soup, kung pao chicken and chicken fried rice were good enough to get again so I will be back for those. The service and staff were fair,  no smiles, just doing the job."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. The wor wonton soup was extremely salty, tasted greasy and the wontons were so over cooked they were  disintegrating. Pad Thai was not at all like Pad Thai... the sauce wasn't anything resembling any Pad Thai I've had in the past... it tasted like over cooked fettuccini noodles... the chicken wasn't stir fried it was like they bought a roasted chicken at the grocery store and pulled it apart and through it on top of the over cooked pasta. The vegetables they had thrown in were mushy and the scallions were cooked until they were a dark brown. I'd never go back.  It was gross"}
{"text":"Shrimp fried brown rice.  That's something I didn't think was possible until I asked these guys.  The food is good and the service is decent.  It's not 5 stars because unfortunately, even if you call minutes ahead of time, delivery is faster than in store pickup easily.  It's a bit weird, but other than that a solid place that I would still recommend in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"New owners took over & bam what a diffrence. The food is the bomb with great selections. The prices is worth the amount of food you get too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Both times I have been here the food is amazing, and the service is quick, friendly, and precise. The Mongolian beef is by far the best I've had, pretty much from anywhere I have ever been, and I have lived in and visited over 12 states."}
{"text":"I started getting take out from here because I recently moved, and it is by my house.  I have to say that this is one of the best fast food Chinese places in the area.  So far Everything has come out great.   I have had the mapo tofu, the sesame beef, and the chicken wings.  The portions are fantastic for the price.  Everything was nice and hot.  The Tofu was super silky and soft, and both the chicken and beef was very crispy and tasty.  The flavors were on point for a crispy, sweet greasy salty dinner.  I really liked everything.  The biggest issue was the amount of oil in the mapo tofu, but other then that this place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Well, the food arrived quickly. That's about all that can be said good of this place. The egg drop soup was downright gross. How they managed to make it so thick without giving it any flavor I don't know. We didn't know the wonton soup had shrimp. as a result, my girlfriend with a severe shellfish allergy is now dealing with the repercussions of that. The Orange chicken merely tasted sweet. Not orange. just sweet. Like all they did was used colored corn syrup. Same exact thing can be said for the lemon \"sauce\". The fact that the orange sauce and the lemon sauce and the egg drop soup all looked identical should have been a warning. The sesame beef was pretty much the only thing we ordered that had actual flavor, but that flavor was an overpowering sesame. I wish I had something good to say about this place. Just moved to the area and need to find a good chinese delivery. Guess I'll keep looking. How this place has such a high rating is beyond me."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. I ordered chicken teriyaki, not what I was expected. Their version of chicken teriyaki looks like steamed chicken, cut up and they poured thick gravy look like teriyaki sauce. server was nice. There were only me and another guy at the restaurant. At 12pm, maybe its their lunch time so they put 2 tables together and everybody were eating there, all 7 employees. To me, it's kind of wierd. They could've take turn having their lunch break so they still have employees paying attention and serving their customers."}
{"text":"Love the House Fried Rice. My favorite item on the menu. The rice is never dry and the added meat is moist and tender. And the prices are great!!!"}
{"text":"Almost a five-star.  Good food with quality ingredients, with fast delivery.  They messed up order and gave me chicken broccoli instead of general tso chicken.  Of course the delivery guy was gone by the time I figured out the mistake.  Chicken broccoli was still good, but I was just craving for general tso chicken that night.  It is not a big deal as mistakes happen.  I would order from this place again."}
{"text":"This isn't amazing Chinese food. This is the greasy Chinese food that you're craving, it's sort of good and you don't know why. I've had much better. I'm sure you have too. But, this is cheap and a lot of food. Which is probably what you want right now."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place for Chinese food!! Low delivery charge, and they're very quick to deliver as well!!! Also have very good sushi!! I suggest the sushi burrito!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good ans the people are always so nice and helpful. They get the food ready fast everytime we show up and the girls are always so polite and smiling. Will keep coming back"}
{"text":"Great food, clean bathrooms, quiet, and cheap. The lady running the counter was on it, like a service ninja. Real attentive."}
{"text":"I always order them through grubhub usually for lunch. My favorite is their sushi burrito so I get that and some soup or an egg roll. I ordered today at 2:20 pm and by 2:38 they were at my house. I do live quite close but that is still amazing service. I also love their food. It's delicious and cheap and you can't go wrong with their service"}
{"text":"Thumbs up! Delivery is fast food is hot and so delicious!!! Delivery charge is cheap will definitely recommend! Thank you"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! If I could give it zero stars I would because neither I nor my girlfriend could stomach more than a few bites of anything. Honey Walnut shrimp and orange beef taste like perfume. Everything we had has a strange off flavor. Crab Rangoon like burnt wanton and old cream cheese. Would never return and I wish I could give them all this nasty food and get my money back. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from grub hub. They were super fast and the food was super delicious and hot.. I will definitely be calling whenever I'm craving Chinese food. Great for lazy days!!"}
{"text":"Honestly....5 stars.   My husband and I love Chinese food... But we don't always know where to go in the area around our house. All of the places are brand new to us. So this time we decided to look up something on Yelp and try it out. Wow... All I can say is... This totally paid off. We've ordered from other neighboring places before... And those have not really worked out. Not only did those places not work out... But they were absolutely terrible. This was a huge gamble.   I didn't keep close track of the time, but I know that the amount of time from when I placed the order to the moment they showed up at the door was so fast that I was actually confused and thought a neighbor was knocking at our door. That right there was incredible... I know pizza places that take way longer than that.   The food was just so... Delicious. My husband and I were so happy. I know this sounds weird, but coming from Reno we have a lot of amazing Chinese food places to choose from and living in Las Vegas...not so much. Maybe it depends on the area.... I don't know... All I know is that we will definitely be coming here again and we will definitely keep ordering food....and eating...all of it :)"}
{"text":"The fired tofu and vegetables with sauce so good!! Beef Lo mein and fried chicken wing also our favorite. And they delivered food so fast. My husband and me give them five stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Very oily and appears they mix their chicken, pork and fish all in the same oil. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Chinese places on this side of town,  and this place is possibly the worst I have encountered.   I saw the reviews were either great or horrible so I didn't know what to think,  and just prayed it would at least  be average. My prayers were not received.     We ordered pick up through yelp,  it gave us a crazy wait time, so I called to verify time.   They told me the correct wait time,  and then got a message through yelp as well with updated wait time.   They were ready about 10 minutes after time estimate with the food.   The bag was heavy as heck so I thought,  ok good portions that's great,  and prices are low maybe there is hope...   So we got crab rangoons,  chicken fried rice,  normal fried rice,  orange chicken,  and the Singapore noodle.   Crab Rangoon was OK, only thing that was not awful. However,  the dipping sauce had the weirdest after taste.  It was like concentrated tap water.   Also no spicy mustard sauce in the bag we got just lots of soy sauce,  which makes no sense with the items we had.     Fried rice was obviously loaded with msg.  It had that heavy salt and almost chemical flavor.   The onions were still to raw and took over.     Orange chicken dry just like the other reviewer had stated,  and the flavor was one note.   It just looked congealed and sad.   I didn't touch the noodles because I couldn't handle spice that night.. And I was mildy afraid at this point.   So yes I don't care how bad I'm craving Chinese,  this place won't do anything but make me bloated and disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious! I was looking for a new place and decided to give them a try. The War Won Ton soup was fresh and tasty. I was very impressed with their speedy delivery. I will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Been sick in bed and craving some WOR WON TON SOUP.  So I had to use my yelp knowledge and find a Chinese place that delivers which is very limited.   Found CHINA AAA and surprisingly they had some Japanese food you can choose from.   I found my WON TON $5.95 but not WOR WON TON- it was ok and I don't like when the Won Ton seems to be all wrappers and not much filling.  Had lots of stuff in it such as veggies, and meat.  I got busy eating the other stuff so will have to truly rate this next time when it's fresh.  The HOUSE FRIED RICE $7.25 was pretty good.  Lots of stuff in it, meat, shrimp, chicken, port, and not over soy-sauced.  Thumbs up. HOUSE CHOW MEIN  $7.25  yummy.  Lots of goodies in it as far as meat and shrimp and beef...and not at all greasy like it usually is.  Thumbs up. CRAB RANGOON  (8 Pcs) $4.95 ok/so-so.  I'd say the ones from Panda is better.   CUCUMBER SUNOMONO SALAD= typical salad.  Not bad.   HOUSE SPRING ROLLS 2 for $2.95....It had a surprise..not all veggies and had a big shrimp in it.    So....for now....they got three STARS.   Not bad.  I like to try it again for second chance before they go on the GREEN list or RED list.    They get a bonus thumbs up for DELIVERY and only cost $2.00.  That's pretty reasonable considering how much gas costs nowadays.    It's pretty good when you're sick and can't fix yourself some food or go and get some."}
{"text":"We've ordered takeout at on least 3 different occasions from this restaurant and they were very polite when taking our order, extremely quick to deliver and the food was always excellent. Never was an order incorrect, were we disappointed with the amount of food for the price or did we have a complaint of any kind. We're about to place another takeout order and I felt that it was finally time to share a review. Give this place a try, but remember that the minimum order is $10.00 and the delivery fee is $2. I really like the Hong Kong Chow Mein; the vegetarian in the family has tofu options and there are appetizers for the family to share as well. The hubby loves the Orange Chicken (old faithful). Hope you enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"I always order delivery from the same Chinese restaurant and yesterday I decided to try out someplace new. This place had good reviews on Yelp AND they deliver.   I placed my order at around 8:30pm and my food was here before 9pm which was shocking because normally places take extra long. I was already very pleased. The food was also great! I ordered the chow fun noodles, beef w/ spicy garlic sauce and honey walnut shrimp; which were ALL GOOD! The honey walnut shrimp was seriously the best I've ever had. It has a hint of lemon in there which made it super good and not too rich. The portions were perfect as well.   Think I found my new go to Chinese delivery :)"}
{"text":"Just decided to order some  food to be delivered. My first time...Mid Afternoon today. It arrived in half the time ( 5 stars for that).  Everything was so good.....especially the Wor Wonton Soup...... I was really impressed..... Oh, I never give 5 stars the first time...but if I get the same service and quality the next time, it's a done deal. For now I would but it on your bucket list for last minute.meals to be delivered. P.S. They do love there salt.....Just a heads up....."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese in Las Vegas. Always delicious. Always super fast delivery. Always great service. I have been ordering from here for 3 years and will continue as long as I'm near."}
{"text":"How does this place have so many stars? I'm not a fan of giving so low of a rating, but sometimes it has to happen to warn others.   We searched Yelp for Chinese delivery and decided to try this place.   The poke salad was awful. I know it's fish, but it tasted fishy and had an overwhelming smell of fish. I hesitated, but tasted it. It tasted like metal and seaweed.   The Pad Thai...ummm...if you even want to call it Pad Thai. It was bland and the chicken was questionable. Not sure it was even chicken. Plus, it didn't even have crushed peanuts. Don't bother ordering this.   The orange chicken and fried rice were the only things that were edible. Even if this was the only thing we ordered, I'd only give this place 3 stars.   Long story short - never ever eating here again."}
{"text":"I am a first time customer at this sushi restaurant. I was recommended through yelp. I ordered the dynamite roll and rainbow roll by pick up. When I got there about 15 minutes later, my order was ready. I was very impressed that by the time I waited behind a gentleman, and it became my turn, my food was ready. The sushi is really good! I just recommend less onion on the dynamite roll. But I plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service, fast delivery, great prices. Ordered directly from the yelp app, hot fresh food was delivered with a smile around 20 minutes later. Delivery driver was very nice as well. Broccoli chicken and cream cheese Rangoon were great. Will definitely order again. Thanks for great service!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and very friendly staff.  I usually order it for pickup but this time i decided to eat in and i loved it.  The display of food on your plate actually looks like something you would get in an expensive restaurant.  Staff was very nice and checked up on us just enough times to make sure we were satisfied but not annoyed.  The food here is very tasty. Come check this place out"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and delivery was super speedy given the time of night I ordered.   I've struggled to find decent Chinese food in the valley, and this is one of two restaurants I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing. Huge portions of food and the service is great! The waitress is always very nice to us and always makes sure we have what we need. Great Chinese spot!"}
{"text":"Came in 5 minutes after 4 o'clock so I had to pay extra for the lunch bento box. (My only complaint, considering I was outside looking at the menu and then had to wait to be attended) I had a crunch roll and general tso's chicken. I was really pleased with the whole meal, everything was good and the lunch portion was a lot of food, I had leftovers. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I've dined in and ordered delivery several times. Always good! And delivery always comes early :)"}
{"text":"Honestly the food was pretty bad.  The Orange chicken was dried out garbage, ended up throwing away the entire thing.  The curry chicken that I ordered mild  was too spicy to eat and had a very weird taste to it.  Just overall bad.  Only gave an extra star because very fast delivery , so I imagine the service is good."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try due to all of the positive reviews. What a mistake. This was probably the worst Chinese food I have ever had. Ordered three meals and ended up throwing all three meals away. Beef was inedible and the chicken was not all white meat. Terrible. Will never be back"}
{"text":"Came based on the inexplicably high rating here on yelp, very hungry. Long story short, all 5 of the items I ordered were bland and of the same poor, soggy consistentcy you find at panda express.. Except with less flavor. The kung pao was NOT spicy at all and the honey walnut shrimp was a soggy disgrace for the price, sorry guys. The positive reviewers most certainly have NOT tasted really good Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is my first time came in here for dine in. Owner made the rolls and sushi for me. It was so good. Amazing! The spider roll is warm inside with fresh taste of cucumber. The hamachi nigiri just superb. The appearance is outstanding the fish is perfect cut for the among with rice. Just love here. Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"We ordered for a delivery tonight and it was so good my family really love it...the guy who did the delivery was so nice. The roll was yummy"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this Chinese Food! My husband and I have decided this is the place we will order from now on when we are in the mood for Chinese! They missed our edamame in our delivery so I called the restaurant to let them know. They apologized and had the delivery guy at our door within about 10 minutes. He had our edamame and a couple of spring rolls for our trouble. We appreciated how they handled the mistake!"}
{"text":"Normally they are decent, but today I ordered the Tuna Poke, and it was horrible. The greens tasted like dirt, and the pickle ginger tasted like mold, I loved the speed they deliver and I like the staff. Just this menu item was yuck."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The food is okay when we're craving \"Chinese\" but don't want to drive to china town or sit down in a restaurant and want to eat at home. We enjoy the Hong Kong style crispy noodles, fried rice and orange chicken. Our least favorite is their honey walnut shrimp. The first time it tasted funny like floral and bitter. We called and they apologized explaining that someone might have put too much lemon powder. They gave us a credit which is why we decided to go back a second time. The second time we went back we decided to order the honey walnut shrimp again. This time I didn't go and sent my sister. They let her try it before she left and she said it was ok and better than before. However when she brought it home and I tried it, I still didn't like it. Although the floral and bitter flavor wasn't strong, it was still noticeable and present. My husband and I both could not stomach it. Fortunately everyone else could tolerate it enough to eat, but we all decided we no longer will be ordering that. Other than that everything else was good or ok. The portion sizes and prices are decent."}
{"text":"Super prompt delivery, very nice and always smiling when they deliver! I've never once had an issue and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here on Saturday. Walked in and three employees standing at the counter they just stared at us like they never seen customers.  Finally one of them gave us menus.  The beef curry I ordered was the worst I have ever had. I've traveled extensively in Asia so I know what it should taste like.  It was very salty.  We had to ask for napkins, chopsticks, as the server didn't give us any.  Also ordered wings omg so salty couldn't eat them.  I don't understand how this place can stay in business there were no customers and seven employees working.  My advice is ur craving Chinese food go elsewhere fast."}
{"text":"This place was really good and the delivery was really fast. Singapore needles are definitely highly recommended. I'm new to this area and I will definitely be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"First time trying this place tonight as I was craving Chinese. I am definitely the type of person who gets a bit nervous trying any type of delivery service because I have had bad luck with getting orders right in the past. But China AAA was excellent service! They delivered fast!! They said it would be 45-60 mins but it came in 35! And everything was correct! Woohoo! And the food- wow! So yummy! The shrimp lo mein, egg drop soup and volcano roll were incredible! We got more food but those were my favs! I will definitely be ordering delivery from China AAA again and again! Thank you for the fast delivery and wonderful food. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Bomb Chinese food! Taste very clean and so much flavor. Not like those places in every shopping center you see or have been to. This is authentic Chinese food"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was good, we ordered pork in black bean sauce and shrimp in lobster sauce. Restaurant serves in family style. The one downside is they're Chang (stingy) with the bowl of rice. But I guess we could ask for another bowl. The food is good. I don't know what the others are complaining about. To me if the service people can't speak English, it's pretty authentic. Those other ppl who complain about the taste must be regulars at Panda Express, which everyone knows is the standard to compare all Chinese cuisine to (sarcasm intended). Get off your high horses ppl. Food is food. You don't like it, go to McDonald's across the street, maybe that's more to your liking."}
{"text":"Beware this place was just on dirty dinning for roaches if i was you I'd  stay away from this place and go  pandas across the street"}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering, I'm so impressed! !! So delicious, best sushi rolls I've have in a while, i had it deliverd and everything still came crunchy. I ordered the Rolling Hills Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Spider Roll, and Honey Walnut Shrimp.  My favorite was the Las Vegas roll!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Food was delicious and very quick arriving. Definitely will order there again."}
{"text":"My go to spot for general Tso chicken. It's best if you can eat it fresh as it's still crispy but even if it's soft the sweet and salty still goes well with rice even if the texture isn't there. They have a great and inexpensive lunch menu. I think all of the items can be made lunch portion but I'm not sure."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese resturants I've had in vegas. Not only are te prices great but the taste of the food is amazing. I have gotten food 3 times from here and I've been happy every time. They also deliver an it's fast! I love how this place has sushi too! It's pretty cool to have found a place that delivers sushi. And believe it or not te sushi is bomb. I got the dynamite roll. Sooo good! I will be a weekly customer here"}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place.  I grab takeout about once a week after working out next door.  The house lo mein is amazing, and definitely check out the Spicy Tuna Nachos.  Friendly staff, and great food, fresh & fast!"}
{"text":"We are sushi lovers and tried sushi  from this place. While the place itself might look like a general fast food or take out near a supermarket these guys did their job perfect.  Sushi are very delicious and when dining in are served very beautifully. The service was also perfect with complimentary soup and ice cream.  We will definitely visit it again on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"If you want simple and good Chinese food, this is the place. Delivery was literally 15 minutes for me. Thank you !!"}
{"text":"I usually just order their lunch roll special to go however me and my boyfriend decided to eat here for lunch . They have really cheap lunch specials and pretty decent food . I havent really had any bad experience here . Just your typical fast food chinese restaurant . Only thing I didnt like is the food being a little too salty for me. Service was fantastic there was two girls checking up on us."}
{"text":"i love this place, its run and cooked by all chinese people.. across the street from my house!! fast speedy and made to order!!"}
{"text":"My wife likes this place because the sushi delivered, is actually pretty good quality. But I, not a huge fan of sushi, usually order something else. Every time I do, I request a high spice level, and always get severely disappointed.   Of the dishes I've ordered... Spicy Garlic Chicken (Really good!), General Tso's Chicken (Okay). I've ordered the General twice. Once at spice level \"spicy\" and once at \"very spicy\". I feel like the \"spicy\" was more than what I got when I ordered \"very spicy\". Either way, they both COMPLETELY lacked on heat.   When I order \"very spicy\", I want my mouth to be on fire. This was as mild as can be. No kidding, it had ZERO heat. It's like they don't pay attention to customer's orders and make whatever they want.   This was probably my last time at China AAA"}
{"text":"We are in love with the Bento Box! It is really too much food, but not complaining! Sushi was decent, chicken was Great and we really liked the vegetable rolls too. Overall, great place for fast food Chinese."}
{"text":"This place has probably one of the lowest delivery fee among all the restaurants that deliver to my place and one of the lowest minimum order, but the food is definitely very good for the price. So far I've ordered the moo goo chicken (if you like things on the light side), the Singapore noodle (if you like curry), the chow fun, and Kong Pao chicken. For chow fun, I hate it when all the rice noodles are clumped together and when you eat it, one side has seasoning and the other side is just plain white. The rice noodles in chow fun does not do that here. This is when I can tell the chef is skilled. Kong Pao chicken is just what I expected also. I'll definitely be coming back if I'm craving some Chinese take outs!  P.S. I'm not sure about the non-typical Chinese dishes that's on the menu and I don't think I will ever try it. If you want pad Thai, go to a Thai restaurant, if you want sushi or raw fish, go to a Japanese restaurant. Why would you want to eat non-Chinese dishes at a Chinese restaurant is out of my concern, but I can guarantee that you will be disappointed. Don't let the menu fool you. Hope this helps :)"}
