{"text":"This place is amazing! Great food and service. Plates are unique. The country plate uses the world's best gravy. Will be back to bring the family."}
{"text":"We we found Served on Yelp while we were visiting Las Vegas for the weekend. It was about 6 miles from our hotel, but worth every bit of the drive. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile and the staff was extremely friendly. Then we started with the food.  They brought toasted  bread with a pesto spread that was delicious.  From there it got even better... The pork belly burger was amazing!!!!  The best burger I've ever eaten.  We also had the pork belly fried rice and the Wellington burger.  Every bite put a smile on our faces (and we can be tough critics).  The meal was so incredible we had to have their desert which was a berry bread pudding.  We would highly recommend this restaurant and the staff that they have working here.  The Chef came out to greet us and ask how our meal was, which is unusual these days.   Wish this restaurant was in San Diego as we loved the entire experience and will definitely come back again.   Go visit... you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional and the food was beyond expectations. What else could you ask for? What I pleasantly surprised by was how perfectly cooked and seasons the ingredients were. I ordered the Peruvian Lomo Saltavo and it has an intricate combination of flavors. Each perfectly cooked, not too burned or over salted which most places don't give much attention to detail. There was only one exception and it was a little too overdone on the garlic for my taste. Overall I believe this is our new breakfast/brunch place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, but had to try it  because I am familiar with Chef Matt from his previous restaurants. Everything was delicious. Chef Matt came out to greet the guests and check if everything was to their liking! I was even lucky enough to be brought a complimentary appetizer; Scottish egg ... which was delish! Nice and quaint little spot with big healthy portions! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was super yummy!! My hubby ordered Pork Belly Eggs Benedict and I got Korean tacos;) everything was spot on! Even the homemade kimchee!! 

The menu is very diverse...something for everyone! The service is spot on...I didn't get her name but she was super sweet to my little one who just found her voice. 

I don't understand how people take the time out of their day to write rude and inconsiderate reviews. If it's not ur cup of tea...you don't need to return. It takes a strong and courageous person to open a local restaurant...and if the food is delicious...it's a local spot I will support!"}
{"text":"First, the staff is very friendly and our lovely waitress took care of our every need. Good luck if you're an indecisive eater because every thing sounded so good! I ended up ordering the Pork Belly Benedict and the thai hollandaise sauce was killer! YOU MUST TRY THE BACON.. I am excited to go back and try all of the other items on the menu that caught my attention."}
{"text":"Great food, very good service, reasonable prices.... the only reason not a 5 star was décor."}
{"text":"Wow.  Rarely do you find a menu like this.  I wanted everything, finally settling on the BBQ burger.  It was phenomenal.

I shared a berry French toast with my SO, which was equally fantastic.

Don't miss this place if you're in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"The server was so bad it over shadows the chef's food.  Like Maya Angelo once said \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\" \"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\"  This was exactly our experience.  Stay away unless you'd like to be \"Served\" passive aggression, borderline racism, subpar attention and a side of bad attitude."}
{"text":"This restaurant was incredibly good. It is a little out of place with its location in the back corner of the shopping center on Horizon Ridge and Valley Verde. The menu is very unique and it all looked really good. Local owned business. The owner came out to check on us. The food was cooked very well if you like medium rare burgers and salmon. Flavors were so good. Good happy hour. Much more like a restaurant you would find in CA or on the strip."}
{"text":"The breakfast was amazing. Very original twist on classic fare. Service was fantastic. Make sure to make a reservation, especially for brunch"}
{"text":"Um...... awesome plating and presentation, high quality food, decent price...... you better come and try this place. We had the tempura apple pancakes and Huevos Rancheros. Amaze balls."}
{"text":"salmon panang had the most amazing curry sauce i've EVER had no joke ive had all kinds of curry sauces ive been eating it my whole life and this one is by far the best i've ever had garlic rice and vegetables were great and fish was delicious cooked and served perfectly my favorite place for breakfast or brunch love it"}
{"text":"Really, really good food! Unique menu, too. Great little place, good find. Loved the shrimp tempura tacos."}
{"text":"I came into Served having no expectations or desires beyond a hot plate of calories to burn after a long drive up from LA. Instead, I found delicious, gourmet quality food at a decent price. There is a normal wait for the food to be cooked, so if you're used to microwaved stuff you may get antsy, but it's quick in relative terms. The servers are very nice, down to earth people, and my waitress Jamie always made sure my glass was full and I had everything I needed. 

I went from having a terrible day and an equally terrible headache to feeling content and relaxed, the bahn mi I ordered was perfect, succulent and crispy pickled vegetables balanced with the juicy, incredibly tender pork belly. The only thing I would change is adding a bit more cilantro, but I'm the kind of person who really likes cilantro. 

If that wasn't enough, the chef and owner Matt came out to ask me how I liked it, and he was very friendly. But what impressed me even more was his 4-5 year old son holding the door for me on the way out, even while taking a box outside for his dad. Clearly Matt knows how to raise children as well as he cooks, and the overall experience at Served shows his dedication to making a great dining experience. I'm glad I just moved in next door and I'll probably be eating here every day now!"}
{"text":"Great Food!   Chef even came out and asked how we liked our food!!!  Waiter was VERY friendly!  Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try out a new restaurant for the hubby's bday. We decided to choose Served over Kitchen Table because neither of us had been there before.
Our waitress was pleasant. We tried the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict. There wasn't much pork on it, and the pork that was on it had lots of fat. It was served with potatoes, which were kind of cold. 
We also tried the Bi Bim Ba. Nothing to write home about. The rice was hard and crunchy. So much so, that we asked the waitress if we could hair have fresh rice. We know that fried rice is usually made with old rice, but it made it almost inedible. 

There was nothing that made me want to come back. A little overpriced, and the food wasn't all that great. And since portions are small, you kind of leave feeling hungry. 

I am glad I tried it out though, because I like to try small businesses."}
{"text":"First time visit. We saw reviews on Yelp and looked good! I had the pork belly Benedict and my wife had the soft shell crab Benedict. Both were excellent! Jamie and Amanda were awesome! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So many great things to say. Food was so tasty & thoughtfully prepared. Loved the selections, generous portions!! Thanks to my husband for stepping out of his comfort zone with the same ol', same ol'.   This place is quite a find. The menu has so many different selections I plan on coming back many times over to try them all. Hubby devoured his Wellington burger & don't leave without trying the bacon. Chef stopped by to ensure we loved our food, nice touch. And yes, we loved it!!"}
{"text":"Long wait for the food even though the restaurant wasn't busy. Had the Bibimbap, the meat was very though and flavorless."}
{"text":"Food was not only delis but very pleasing to the eyes!!! Edible flowers was a very nice touch n we enjoyed every bite.  Will be back next time we r in town."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. It took around a half hour... But was worth the wait. You can tell the owner cares about his food, and pleasing his guests. Glad to support a local business, and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my family. The hostess was very pleasant and held the door for us. My father ordered the carne asada tacos, my husband ordered the Wellington burger, my mother ordered the shrimp tacos and I had the Korean BBQ plate. Everything was DELICIOUS!!!!! My husbands hamburger patty was so moist and juicy and was by far the tables favorite. We saw that pupusas were on the menu as well and being Salvadorian we were immediately intrigued. The chef kindly brought out a pupusa for the table to share. What a great twist on a pupusa it was was soooo good!! Def will be back when we are in town. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. The food was presented perfectly and flavors were amazing. Every detail was perfect from the chips and salsa appetizer to the enormous pork belly burger my dad got. We were all very impressed and will return for sure. Service was outstanding as well, we met the chef and told him how happy we were with the food. Very nice people!!"}
{"text":"I hope that this place makes it because everything was top notch!  Prices are on par with other breakfast joints.  The owner/chef was very personable and came out to check on everything.  He was very attentive and did not seem to be \"going through the motions.\"  Beware the Thai rice!  Spicy hot for you!!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place & it was super yummy. The servers were really friendly. There portions are really big & they have a variety of different kinds of foods. The chef came out to see how everyone's food was at one point & thought this was unique.  We really appreciated being greeted by him. We would love to bring people here to try it."}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch, kinda bummed about the fact they are not serving dinner for me to try next time. Back to the review, what makes the review a five star is the service and of course the food. The chef always make sure all the food coming out of the kitchen is enjoyed by their servers as he comes out of the kitchen to greet and check service. Very good thing for me as a foodie.... 
We ordered the soft shell benedict, french toast, and a bunch of goody stuff and all is exceptional. This is my new go to place evrytime i get here in vegas. Will follow them when they start serving dinner....more power to the staff and crew of this establishment."}
{"text":"The food at this place is amazing. This is our second time eating here, and again the food was much better than our expectations. I ordered the miso pork belly burger. Beef patty, marinated pork belly, arugula salad, tomato, pickles, wasabi mayo, provolone cheese on a brioche bun. It was amazing. The chef takes time to go the each table and ask how is everything. Who does that? We definitely will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Went for lunch. Had the chicken wings, yummy, burger with pork belly, awesome!and salmon Penang.  It was so great, we are going back for dinner tomorrow"}
{"text":"If you think you've had Nutella pancakes before, think again. They have a special right now that involves deconstructed Turon, Nutella, and Oreos. Sounds too sweet, but it's just right! Also had the green eggs and spam, the corned beef bread pudding, and longsilog - all hits! The chef came out to ask us our thoughts and made us feel welcomed! Excited to see how the specials evolve next time we come! Wishing this place makes it back to NYC with me. :)"}
{"text":"Luxury Filipino-infused brunch without the luxury price or noisy Vegas strip crowds!

There's too much to say about this place; I'll stick to what I look for in a dining experience.

Troi, our server, truly wanted us to have a positive and fun brunch experience. He cracked jokes and was incredibly attentive - not too much though. Believe me, if you want to do bottomless mimosas here, make sure Troi is your server... trust me.

Free starter of cinnamon/sugar chips and banana/Nutella spread. Creamy! The chips were too addicting, had to push them away. Had to save room for my monstrous brunch!

Here's what we ordered: Green Eggs and Spam, Tocilog, and Barbacoa Benedict. The garlic fried rice was super garlicky with the Spam breakfast. It wasn't as garlicky with the other two; different batch? Eggs and Spam breakfast slightly salty - it's Spam - and the rice portion could've been bigger. Overall everything was four-star.

They understand how to really cook eggs - by the way, eggs that are dry and have no \"run\" to them are over-cooked. Not an opinion, culinary fact!

The pickled papaya ticked the sweet/sour box, the braised barbacoa melted in the mouth, the green Filipino butter on the eggs was a treat, and the poached egg was buttery perfection. I will return to served!"}
{"text":"My family just temporarily relocated to the area. I am a breakfast food lover! Served is conveniently located close to our new home. I had the BAM slam. It was outstanding ! A lot of food. The bacon must of had some kinda of caramelized sugar on it, tasted great. My waitress Gene was very personable and her service was great. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great little place! Had the huevos rancheros, huge portion for reasonable price and so very tasty! One of the best dishes I have ever tasted! Friendly, fast service, Jaime is the best! Go in and enjoy, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I have long been anticipating the grand opening of Served.  Their menu is extensive and has something for everyone.  You can tell the chef has carefully hand selected each menu item and each dish displays his creative genius.  From a Korean BBQ Plate to a Roasted Pork Belly Bahn Mi to Longanisa Tacos, there is sure to be something on the menu for everyone.  The only downside is trying to decide what to try.  Here's my advice, bring a bunch of people so everyone can sample different things.
My buddy and I ordered the Miso Pork Belly Burger and the Roasted Pork Belly Bahn Mi Sandwich.  Both were delicious and very flavorful.  I enjoyed my sandwich so much so that I decided to order the Shrimp Tempura Po'Boy Sandwich to go.  Again, amazing flavors.  I am so happy that this hidden gem has opened up close to my home.  I can say without a doubt  that this will be my new go-to breakfast/lunch spot.  Do yourself a favor and get served at Served!"}
{"text":"I'm always supportive of new places in the Henderson area, so I was really excited to try this place that was getting good reviews. 

I went in for brunch and the entire experience was very mediocre. First, the ambiance is very odd. It's in a business park and the space feels like it was meant for a commercial business. Also it felt as though they didn't have air conditioning so it felt like a sauna the entire time we were there. 

The food, which is always the most important part, was not very good. I ordered the Filipino breakfast, which is one of their most popular dishes. The eggs were fine, but the garlic fried rice was so hard it was inedible. I know you're supposed to use leftover rice, but it was so hard it seemed undercooked. 

I probably wouldn't recommend this place. Just go to kitchen table which is in the same complex."}
{"text":"Crispy crabby goodness! Great coffee to give you that morning energy. With a side of amazing service!"}
{"text":"Dry corned beef no hollandaise sauce. Won't be back. The waitress revommemdef the dosh. Guess they wanted to get rid of bad food."}
{"text":"Delicious! The fresh, diverse, and unique flavors are satisfying and relatable. Their generous portions will not leave you hungry. Staff was friendly and accommodating! It is obvious much care is taken when prepping these thoughtful ingredients to create such tasty meals!"}
{"text":"So we live in the neighborhood and finally decided to try this place.  We came at about 10:30 on a Thursday, so the place was not very busy.  The decor is simple and rather cheap.  The prices on the menu seemed rather high for a breakfast/lunch place.  Our expectations, at that point, were not very high.

What a surprise!!!!  The food was the best we had in the neighborhood and we have other places that are fairly good.  What's more, the portion sizes were large.  I had the pork belly bahn mi and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  It had a good amount of pork belly and quick pickled vegetables that were still crunchy the way I like them.  My wife had the bread pudding and she couldn't stop raving about it.  The balance of flavors was clearly superior.  It was large enough for 2 or 3 meals.

Now you have to understand that I rarely rate food places high because I am an amateur chef.  My wife has not liked ANY restaurant since we moved here last year and she is very difficult to please.  She loved it.

The chef came out and we spoke to him.  There are several items on the menu I'd like to try.  I prefer out-of-the box creations especially with an ethnic touch and there is a lot for me to try.  They have a large burger menu and their burgers are made with ground short rib meat.  That's one I have to try.

They do have a limited staff so I would imagine service will be slow if there are a lot of customers.  Everything is made on the spot so it is extremely fresh.  That will take some time so don't come here if you are in a rush or have small children who aren't patient.  Also, if ambiance is your thing, try elsewhere.  But if you come to a restaurant for the food, this is one of the best places you can try."}
{"text":"One of the Best lunch and breakfast places I have ever eaten at. The people who work here are really nice. This is my second time here and I would come again"}
{"text":"First time here. Korean tacos are the bomb. Not your usual menu.  It's always nice to see the chef come to your table and ask how everything was. Can't wait to come back. Thanks to Yelp and the previous diners for their recommendation."}
{"text":"Loved this local place. The best and most beautifully delicious food. We will go there for sure when we are in Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"All I can say is...Yes! Yes! Yes!  We had Spinach Salad, Corned Beef Hash and The Turkey Bacon. Ambiance is perfect for any occasion. Service outstanding. Prices are on pace with the large portions and high quality."}
{"text":"Came for Brunch!! Excellent! Had the BAMSlam. The owner agreed to do an omelette with the eggs! Never had a more fluffy, perfectly cooked omelette! So so good! I wanted to skip the bacon because of the fat but decided to get it! Thank goodness! No one can do better with bacon than this!
Overall a perfect breakfast! So filling and satisfying! You must come here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant may be a baby in terms of how long it has been opened, but the food definitely exposes the chef's complex abilities. We were in town visiting from Northern Cali and found this gem tucked away and I can passionately say, the food was not short of AMAZING!! The food we had was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. You first start off with complimentary chips and salsa but it's not just your typical chips and salsa. The chips were uniquely seasoned which only enhanced when you added their wonderful salsa to it. It was soooo good that I could just eat it on its own and walk out satisfied with a huge smile on my face. 

On to the main course, my dish was the Turf and Side Benedict which had filet mignon, mushrooms spinach atop 2 slices of sourdough and can't forget the béarnaise sauce. The hubby had a pork belly Benedict which was equally delish! It was accompanied with some potatoes that were cooked with perfection. The whole meal was exquisite with every bite. 

A lot of credit to Matt, the chef, who came out to greet his guests and get feedback on his dishes. Something you rarely see and only see at high end restaurants. It shows his concern and passion for the work of art that he creates and brings to your table. Thanks Matt for a wonderful brunch. 

There were a lot of mouth watering dishes on their menu that we look forward to trying in the near future. Highly recommend this place to everyone that's in the area. Don't pass off this place cause you will be missing a lot!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast. Huge portions. Best blueberry pancakes. Baked berry French toast even better!"}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing! The Chef came out to the tables and spoke with everyone. My husband is a burger lover and he says the burger he ordered here was by far the best he has had. We also ordered the tacos and the chicken wings. Both were delicious. We plan on making this restaurant a stop each time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Every plate was elevated. Im not a dessert guy but the French Toast is a must have. Ono fried chicken was sooo good"}
{"text":"Keep going back for more. Love the eclectic fusion of flavors. Excited to hear they are expanding hours."}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying out. Interesting menu and great food. Everybody was super nice"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me??? Look at this gorgeous work of Art! Corned Beef Hash Bread Pudding Benedict! I stopped by on a whim craving something different and WOW! This was amazing!  In fact, where I was sitting near the door, the next few guests that walked in, I pointed to my breakfast and said \" This was AMAZING!\" and heard both tables ordering the same!

The corned beef is soooooo tender and delicious..it is brined for over 6 hours..sitting over a huge pile of perfectly cooked potatoes and crispy (outside) chunks of Marbled Rye (bread pudding style). 

To make it even more eye popping it's served on a warmed black slate..Wow! 

This is something I would never have normally ordered..(I came in craving an omelette), but I went with the servers recommendation and so glad I did..I'm so full I'm taking the other half home!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, presentation was great. The chef came out and asked us how everything was, service was also great! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First off our server was awesome. He was always attentive and very nice. The food was phenominal. Alot of love went into each dish! The chef was a humble guy named Matt and he is very passionate about what he does. It shows!! The picture don't them justice but we were very surprised that stumbled upon this gem!. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First visit to this delightful little gem in Henderson! Food was delicious and such a unique menu. So many wonderful sounding choices we will definitely be back. Jaimie the owner took great care of us. Even bringing out samples of some extra things to try. My husbands club sandwich was the best he ever had! Chef Matt comes out to each table to make sure your meal is to your liking. Great service and delicious food! Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is small, but the food was good. There is construction all around it so I am contributing the bad sewer smell that hits your senses as soon as you walk in to that construction.  Add to that what ever scent they were using to try to cover it up and it was a true assault on the first impression of the establishment. They were having problems with their coffee machine so the coffee was not hot , but it was very flavorful. I just wasn't able to add the cold cream to my liking. I will return after the construction in the area is farther along."}
{"text":"Went  to  Serve  based on prior Yelp reviews.  Had very good service.   Server was there to answer any questions  we had about the menu.  The menu  has a big variety of different  things I had previously  never heard of.  Food was very good.  Also, chef/owner came by to see if we were satisfied.   Glad we came there."}
{"text":"Went to another place but wait was too long, saw this place on yelp and I was glad I came. Had the short rib Benedict and it was AWESOME! My wife had the pancakes which were beyond fluffy. I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The longsilog was wonderful and chicken wings was so flavorful and juicy. And the service was great! and the owner came out to talk to us which was awesome..Very satisfied,  will be back."}
{"text":"Multicultural perfection is all I am going to say!! Absolutely blown away at the taste of this food, I went Peruvian for my entree and an appetizer of some of the best bacon I've ever had. Served is the type of place I will go back on a weekly basis!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to for brunch. Their menu is so well made that every dish is delicious, not just certain dishes. Their restaurant has a cute classy family style to it, it's very welcoming, and the waiters and chef are all so friendly.

For drinks, their Mango Melon Juice is fresh made in house daily and is absolutely refreshing. I get it every time I go here.

For breakfast, their Portobello Eggs Benedict or Pork Belly Benedict is so delicious. I don't personally like eggs benedict, but I actually really love theirs.

For lunch, their Ono Chicken Wings was very delicious with a twist to Hawaiian sweet and tasty flavors. The Pork Belly Banh Mi is a fusion to Vietnamese sandwiches and had meat that was very moist. On the lighter side, the Spinach Salad is very simple yet one of my favorites. The Miso Pork Belly Burger is one of their signature dishes and it does not disappoint. As you bite into it, you can see all the juicies bursting out from the burger and it is served with crispy potato nuggets.

Complimentary chips (with a secret seasoning) and salsa are served.

Love the food here, love the service, love the atmosphere, only wish this place opened for dinner!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Been 4 times now and chef comes to our table every time, just to make sure we like everything.  We love everything!!!
Hidden gem and as much as I want them to be slammed, I love that every time we have gone, we haven't had to wait for a table.... new weekend brunch spot!!!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviewers have this place right. Being a restaurant manager, I was surprised how phenomenal the food was. Chef touches tables making sure guests are enjoying which is rare to see in Vegas. He came to my table and took time to ask about my experience. He has passion and I can definitely taste the Passion behind the dishes. Great local discovery. Awesome service. I will be back for sure. Must try the salmon curry dish, on point and delicious."}
{"text":"This is arguably the best breakfast I've had at a restaurant. I will definitely make my way back before going back home."}
{"text":"Me and my friend tried served for the first time today, i read a lot of reviews on yelp before coming here. 
So I read that this place can get pretty crowded( it does, some people came today but ended up leaving because of the wait time) so I went ahead and placed a table reservation , luckily when we got there a table was ready for us so yay! 
Our server was great, he knew a lot about what they actually serve.
I got Matt's Omelette and let me tell you this, it was everything I look for in an omelette ! The flavor hit the spot definitely ! And I also tried their blueberry pancake, and that thing was packed with blueberries, good fluffy pancake and not too sweet.
Overall this place is a great breakfast/brunch spot , one thing I can suggest though, is we need more \"SMILES\" in this place :)"}
{"text":"This was one of the most memorable meals I have had in Las Vegas in the past 15 years. The food was out of this world. The staff was attentive but not intrusive."}
{"text":"I was \" SERVED \" with an incorrect order and a lack of customer service.  I would recommend going to McDonald's, at least incorrect orders and bad customer service is to be expected there."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad. I pretty much ate my own creation since I don't like eggs & that was the main part of the meal. It's nice they're flexible. It was also nice to see the chef come out to see if you're enjoying the food. Some nitpicks: the food was warm and I always like it served hot. Also, it was a bit pricey for what I got. However, I may try them again since there were several things I would like to try."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  We tried several different food items and they all tasted excellent.  I am Korean and I've had a lot of great bibimbap so I decided to try their version of bibimbap.  It was delicious!!  It was definitely different from traditional Korean bibimbap but the taste was excellent in a different way.  My husband tried their Wellington beef burger and he said it was very filling and satisfying.  This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"June 22, 2016 
I found this restaurant on yelp. It's only 5 minutes from our house. Small, quaint, and quiet. Located on 1770 W. Horizon Ridge Suite 100. It's in the back area behind the other businesses facing the street. Look for the large banner. I believe it just opened up about a month ago? Perfect location since it's close to our home. Plus....drum role please, they serve breakfast throughout the day! :) That's always a plus when you have a little one who loves pancakes. We ordered a breakfast sandwich, mimosa, pupusa, and blueberry pancakes. You'll receive a complimentary chips and dip. Chef Matthew came out to greet us...I told him my daughter loved his pancakes. 
Flavor & Price 
Blueberry pancakes 5/5 $8.00
Breakfast sandwich 5/5 (my husband was hoping for a round croissant sandwich?) $9.00
Pupusa with fried bananas 5/5 $12.00
Complimentary chips 4/5
Mimosa 5/5 $7.00 
Everyone enjoyed their meal and the service was great. So we'll definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"I will say that the food has been the major draw to served but the service has kept us coming back. My girlfriend and I live anywhere but close to here and we make the trip happily nearly every time we are in Vegas. The chef walks the dining room every twenty minutes or so and seems to check in with every table and actually seems to care whether we like the food! Also have to say Troy our server was great and truly we never saw the bottom of the mimosa's because he's a champ. 
We've only been twice so we haven't sampled much of the menu yet, but everything has been amazing and I really don't think you can go wrong. They seem to have pretty much the same menu except they change the style of the items. 
Will say food is good and service is great wouldn't have gone out of the way to write a review of Troy wasn't as good as he was"}
{"text":"We were seriously blown away by Served. Our server was amazing- clearly enjoyed his job and took it seriously. He gave great recommendations and was on top of everything- service went just as it should. He was super friendly and made it a point to interact with our crazy toddler as well. Service was definitely on point and we definitely appreciate it! 

As for the food- it was equally as incredible. The loaded potato nuggets were insane, and they even topped them with an amazing cheese sauce (it seriously was so good!) I got the BiBimBap which was so good, just the right amount of spice and a perfectly cooked egg! My husband got the Lomo. Which was also incredible and cooked to perfection. The coffee was great as well!  Highly recommend this place to anyone who likes good food and great service."}
{"text":"First time in yesterday. Super impressed! Inventive menu, generous portions, fabulous presentation, and decent prices. I ordered the BLAT sandwich with the sweet potato fries. Thick, delicious, smoky bacon (although it was sweet...fried in brown sugar maybe? Yummy, but not my preference). Two thumbs up on the sweet potato fries. Husband ordered a Korean sandwich and the truffle parm crispy potatoes. I didn't try his sandwich but he said it was great. The truffle potatoes were amazing but rich. Looking forward to coming back and trying many more meals!"}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant last weekend and it was an absolutely amazing experience! It's a small place tucked into a shopping plaza that's right by my house so location is perfect for me. I called to make sure there wasn't a wait and the woman on the phone was very pleasant and also greeted us at the door with a huge smile (she guessed I was the one who called). I had the roasted pork belly tacos that were absolutely phenomenal. I also tried the mac salad which was great yet a tad bit on the dry side but everything else greatly made up for that. The chef came around and asked how our meal was and listed the ingredients in our dishes since we loved the diverse tastes. A little bummed I couldn't have a Bloody Mary with my meal but the mimosa made up for it. Waitress was terrific and anticipated all of our needs well! Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"I received my Yelp shout out on this restaurant and decided to give it a try. After a bit of research I was excited about the menu....so today was the day.
RELAX....CHILL...DONT GO WHEN YOUR IN A HURRY. The restaurant was not that busy for lunch but it took longer than a usual wait to receive our order. BUT......it was well worth the wait! Everything......and I mean from the fried potatoes to the Thai rice,fish tacos,to the chicken sandwich was AWESOME ! Cudo's to the chef. Mathew??? I will make this a regular stop cause I want to try everything on the menu. 
If I was to make a suggestion it would be to our waitress Jamie. Talk more to your guest...keep them tuned in on wait time....SMILE...be happy...customer service,friendliness,and appreciation will go far. 
Thanks for lunch.....yours customers
A waitress

{"text":"The food was amazing! I was so speechless an Asian I have a pretty high standart of Asian meals, I'm so glad to found this place on Yelp when I was just craving for traditional bibimbap. Their bibimbap is wayyyyyy too good!! And their happy hour taco is a good deal.. best fish taco I've ever had!"}
{"text":"First visit: Very nice, believe me, I enjoyed my brunch very much. Fantastic French toast and s portobello Florentine, very nice indeed. All of our friends meals also impressive in appearance of full and fantastic flavors. We sat next to the kitchen door and every plate caught our attention! Fantastic!

One improvement I would like: cappuccinos please. I enjoy a cappuccino with breakfast and brunch.

Second visit, about 4 months later: the food has noticeably changed from our memories. Bigger portions and greasier, heavier food. Not sure if the cooking staff turned over or what but we felt the quality had diminished and we likely won't be going back a third time."}
{"text":"We come here often and usually enjoy our meal. Choose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday, sadly my order came out wrong. Sorry Chef Matt, but this time your cook missed the mark. You had left for the evening."}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by a huge menu that has everything from Barbacoa to Bulgogi. Impressively, flavor and presentation are carefully perfected in every dish. Can't wait to go back. Everything was delicious. Must try the soft shell crab benny, and kimchi fries."}
{"text":"Got there during brunch time and it wasnt busy. seated right away. Its a small restaurant even though it looks big outside. It was dark inside though. My friend and i had ti readjust the curtains on request cause the room needed light! The service was alright. Food tasted good. The menu is creative. Asian fusion food. I had the green eggs and spam. Delicious. Items on the menu was a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"The waitress got my order wrong then 15minutes brought out the same dish. They finally got me the Asian BLAT that I ordered. 
They weren't very apologetic about the mistake. There were only 3 tables in the restruant at the time. 

Pork belly was great. The rest was unimpressive. The texas toast was too thin, wimpy for the sandwhich. Dishes are carb heavy especially with the sides. The food is good just not $15 for a sandwhich good."}
{"text":"The restaurant is able to make tasty Asian-American fusion foods. We were looking for a brunch place and found this on a whim. This is a tiny restaurant that has a homey feel to it. 

Upon sitting, they give you \"tortilla chips\" dusted with cinnamon sugar with a Nutella dip. This may sound sweet, but it is not that sweet and the Nutella was whipped and very light. I had the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict. It was topped with a Thai Chili Hollandaise sauce that was slightly too spicy for my liking, but it was smooth and creamy and paired perfectly with the marinated roasted pork. There was a little too much fat on the pork belly that was not rendered enough, but the overall flavors of the pork was delicious. It paired perfectly with the sauce, where the sauce accentuated the natural flavors of the roasted pork. This was served on a bed of toasted sourdough crostini, where it soaked up the flavors of the pork and the sauce. There was not too much bread, which was good as it did not overpower the pork

My boyfriend got the Longsilog, which is a traditional Filipino breakfast of fried garlic rice, eggs, and longanisa, which is a Filipino breakfast sausage. They make their own longanisa and it was cooked to perfection, with a crispy outer shell, giving it that classic \"popping\" sound when the casing breaks. The sausage itself was slightly sweet and salty, though not overpoweringly sweet. It was accompanied with their own seasoned vinegar, which is a classic pairing with this type of sausage. The vinegar was not as strong as expected, which was great because a lot of times a strong vinegar can mask the flavors of the longanisa. In this case, the longanisa was the star and paired well with the garlic fried rice and eggs."}
{"text":"Very generous portions. There's a reason the menu says \"ask us about our half portions\"!!! I got the BiBimBap which was served on a PLATER could have easily fed two adults, maybe three. The owner and the chef both came out and checked up on us multiple times. Very kokua & ono restaurant! Can't wait for them to open for dinner as well!"}
{"text":"After reading all the high ratings, I felt confident about having a great meal here. 
Normally I don't write too negative of reviews, because every meal can't be perfect every time.....
But I have to say, this place was disappointing. I'm always willing to pay higher prices for exceptional food. This food was average at best. Nothing different than an average breakfast chain. 
Overpriced for underwhelming food. 
I ordered over easy eggs, and they came way over cooked. I was then up-sold a side item, which he ended up forgetting to give me. But he said, \"you won't get anything like this French toast anywhere\" wow! I was excited to try this French Toast winner. I'll just say, sigh, disappointing. 
The service was confusing. With the high price point, you would expect good classy service, but this guy was, how should I say it, tacky, rude. Made the poor little girl at our table so uncomfortable with his \"just kidding jokes\". Made constant silly jokes, forgot a part of my meal, and when I asked about it, he made me feel like I was wrong. I basically had to argue to get this French toast, that he convinced me to try. This server blew it. When you pay $25-$30 for breakfast per person, your server should be attentive and kind. 
Our table left paying over $65 for an average breakfast and decided we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Finally, a creative progressive breakfast-ery in Green Valley.  The food was beautifully plated. The huevos rancheros were tasty, and the blueberry pancakes lived up to expectations.  The Filipino dishes were good, but more fusion than traditional.  

All in all, a great Sunday morning spot !"}
{"text":"This is an excellent fusion restaurant. Family friendly complete with a kids menu. Great customer service. Owner even came to check on us more than omce! They even brought is an appetizer on the house while we waited because it was so busy. Thanks for a great experiwnce!"}
{"text":"the food creations here are as beautiful as they are tasty!! from brunch to dinner i'm always impressed and full service is good too."}
{"text":"The location of this place was a little hard to find at first.  However I'm so glad we decided to check it out after reading reviews on Yelp.   This place is definitely a must, the food is amazing.  If you love the Kitchen Table you'll love Served even more!   Everything on the menu is worth trying.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was one of the best breakfasts we've had in a long time! The pork belly eggs Benedict was flavorful and the potatoes it comes with spicy, and the apple bread pudding French toast was divine. Staff was prompt and friendly and the chef is also the owner. The lunch menu looked good too so we will be back."}
{"text":"Stay Away!!!!!
        Upon arrival at this restaurant (if you can call it that) we were seated by an unenthusiastic waitress. The trouble began from there when we had to wait for a rather long time for our food. When complaining to the restaurant staff we were greeted with excuses about the wait, not results. 
        
         One of my family members got the, rather small, flank steak tacos that were supposedly served with chips however no chips were served. Another member of my family ordered the huevos rancheros which when brought out was cold and had soggy tortillas. Now the meal that I ordered was the chicken and waffles which was a rather bland and unsatisfying meal. 

        When complaining about the poor quality of the food the chef promptly came out to apologize. However when complaining about the chicken and waffles I ordered he explained to me that \"everyone likes it\" and \" that it is brined beforehand\". This condescending behavior from the restaurant staff should not be tolerated and I implore anyone reading this to again...

STAY AWAY!!!!!"}
{"text":"This spot is awesome, better than Craft Kitchen and Kitchen Table. We had the green eggs and spam and the corned beef hash and eggs. Flavors are on point, service is great and location very convenient. Our new go to for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning for some brunch with the family and we were pleasantly surprised! The location is kinda weird almost hidden if I hadn't book marked on Yelp I would never just happen to find this place on my own. 
   The inside is very simply decorated and the shades were drawn down which perhaps made it even more simple. Perhaps some sunshine and change of color on the walls would do wonders! 
   With that said I did not give a damn about the atmosphere because the food was awesome!!! My boys 2 an 11 yrs shared a side of bacon and the burger with tater potatoes. The bacon was delicious thick slices and had some sort of glaze on it that had my 2 year old fighting for the bacon! The burger was juicy  and delicious and they obsessed with the potatoes tater thingys! My husband ordered the Filipino breakfast with longaniza and fried rice and I order the cheese pupusa's topped with beef and an over easy egg both were Nom Nom Good! 
   This was not your ordinary multicultural menu these were some fancy and delightfully unexpected dishes and we will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Please do your comparison of every single other breakfast brunch place in the valley and tell me how this  place can justify the prices they charge!!  I give them an A for staff.  Price is a little high for breakfast, however it was brunch."}
{"text":"This place is sorta hidden but the food is amazing. The price is very reasonable for the quality and amount that is served. I got the ono Wings with garlic fried rice and I really recommend it. It definitely has a nice brunch vibe that I can see my friends and I hanging out in in the mornings."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Food orgasmic!!!!! 
From the cinnamon sugar with Nutella dip for free during breakfast! All the way to dessert, bread pudding French toast is heavenly!!! Amazing food."}
{"text":"Honestly the best breakfast I have ever eaten just try it you'll be happy! And the complimentary cinnamon chips and sauce are addicting! I will be back when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Small breakfast joint with delicious food and great service.   I would recommend trying the Pork Belly Benedict or the Shrimp sandwich.   Both of those are delicious."}
{"text":"This was a perfect breakfast spot for the family! I shared the BAM slam with my daughter and my husband had the huevos rancheros. Everything was so flavorful and the service was great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I've reviewed Served before but it's an amazing food experience. The chef owner and his crew always comes up with awesome new food ideas, and the waiters are very passionate about food and flavors as well. It's a small comfortable little restaurant that has room for at least two big parties (8-10 people). Troy is such an excellent server and is clearly a lover of flavors. I've been coming here every so often for a while. I showed up for the thanksgiving special. Thanksgiving you have to reserve ahead of time and it's 30 per person for the turkey only option + all you can eat sides + dessert. Everything was delicious as always, Turkey was moist, candied yams hit a high sweet note with what tasted like vanilla extract, cranberry sauce had some amazing citrus notes, the veggies were awesome, the chunky mashed potatoes and gravy were excellent. There were some drawbacks, the cornbread+stuffing mix was a bit dry and under seasoned, and the guy who cut our pie slices at the end cut them super small and wonky. But overall everything was wonderful."}
{"text":"The food was great! The chef personally comes around to make sure you're enjoying the food, I think that's awesome and he's really cool. They have a very good menu, lots of options for brunch as well as lunch. I'll definitely be coming back to try the tacos and burgers etc lol the entire menu looks well worth trying"}
{"text":"Omg. That's all I can say every time I take a bite of the food here. The tempura bacon pancakes are out of this world, the barbacoa benedict has this amazing spinach and broccoli salsa that is to die for, and I cannot drink enough of their unsweetened Mango tea. The people that work there are sweet and take great care of you. The amazing chef and owner, Matt, comes out to check on every table. Plus they have a great happy hour 7 days a week!!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and boys took me here for Mother's Day and we loved it! I decided to go outside my comfort zone and ordered the soft shell crab bennies. DELISH! The crab was perfectly crispy (not greasy) and light which complemented the miso hollandaise and eggs perfectly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I thought the presentation of the food was absolutely phenomenal, and the service was awesome.  The apple pancakes were the best ever!  Cora S."}
{"text":"I don't hand out 5-stars often, so when I do, I am truly impressed. 

On our recent trip to LV, we stayed in Henderson, away from the hustle and bustle of the LV strip. Yelped a couple spots we wanted to check out for brunch and I am SO GLAD THAT WE MADE A STOP HERE AT SERVED. It wasn't packed when we arrived so we got seated right away. Our servers were exceptional. So friendly, so quick, and so personable. 

The establishment is small, hip, and very clean. Lots of parking and in a very nice neighborhood. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely be back there to try out the rest of the menu items. 

For this trip, I got the longanisa breakfast. Let me tell you... my belly was SO HAPPY. Something so simple, but was so delicious and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend got the miso burger and he loved it. I look at the picture I took and I'm salivating over the thought of their food. You can be adventurous or a little more on the traditional side. Whatever floats your boat. 

All-in-all, it was definitely a great experience. No reason for me to give anything less than 5 stars. Excellent job, Served! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love that the ambience is quite and cozy. Since they don't have any loud music there, it is easy to hear conversations. It is good for meeting up with friends and catching up. The food is delicious too. We ordered corned beef hash and Longsilog. Both dishes were great."}
{"text":"This is my third visit. I love this place. Now they serve your food on heated slabs of slate. For an eye popper, order the corned beef burger with  hollandaise sauce and egg on a brioche.  Ridiculously delicious !!!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a whim and really, really lucked out.  It was fantastic.  The berry french toast was simply amazing. The green salsa (huevos rancheros) was hot, but very tasty. Buttermilk fried chicken and waffles was on point.  I will be going back to try out their lunch menu and will absolutely go back for brunch."}
{"text":"I had the benedict portobello and it was amazing! The sense of community there is great."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch at Served yesterday and everything we ordered was a hit!

We tried the ono chicken wing lunch plate (wings were cooked perfectly and had a light crunch, the rice had a tasty sweet soy(ish) sauce drizzled on it, and the mac salad was tasty and didn't have a heavy mayo presence), the shrimp tempura tacos (tasty \"yum yum\" sauce, shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly), and the bam slam breakfast (awesome bacon).

Service was really friendly and attentive. The chef/owner even stopped by our table to make sure that we were happy.

We'll definitely be back to try other items - they have a really diverse menu. So glad we tried it!"}
{"text":"Wow. ...just a great local joint! The staff is very friendly and I never had better potatoes anywhere.  Had the softshell crab Benedict which was very good and unique.  I think the chef even came out to check on the customers. I'm glad me and my wife took the trip here and will come back for more"}
{"text":"Small cute place, but the food was awesome!! Had the apple pie tempura pancakes and miso burger with pork belly. Both highly recommend. Not only do they have the 15% off with check in but they also do 20% off take out!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Hearty servings and wonderful service. We appreciated that the chef came to ask how our food was. The Crispy Baked Berry French Toast was soooo yummy."}
{"text":"Love it here. Great staff and service. This is my spot. I have yet to find anything on the menu I don't love. Matt really knows how to come up with an amazing menu. Don't missed out on this hidden gem"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! It is quaint and definitely has that relaxing, intimate feel. My husband and I died over there food!!! They give huge portions and amazing quality! I definitely recommend. And they have bottomless Mimosas!!! Who does that?!? Shout out to Troy our awesome server. He was so personable and friendly :D"}
{"text":"This spot looks like it has a lot of potential. Location is in a business park with limited signage, somewhat hard to find even if you're looking for it because it's just an unexpected area. Menu has something for everybody, from Korean to Hawaiian to tacos and burgers. 

CHIPS & SALSA: Loved the salsa, chips had a light spicy seasoning on them that added flavor. I would consider adding on the guac on another visit. 
TACOS: Our table ordered the tempura fried shrimp and the fish (tilapia) tacos, both were solid. Trio of tacos is packed with protein, liked that they didn't skimp like other places. The sauce on the fish tacos had a nice kick to it.
ASADA SALAD: Definitely get this with a side of salsa, I liked that more than the creamy vinaigrette dressing. Meat could have been cut a little smaller for easier eating, but had good flavor. I like that the salads include beans for extra protein.

Decor is a little limited, but the cute plants on the tables are nice. The dark carpet and curtained-off cooking areas almost give this spot a banquet hall feel. Staff were very friendly and polite. Menu is fresh and seems to be going for a fairly healthy slant, which I appreciated. They offer all-day breakfast, would try those dishes on another visit."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. It was our first visit and we were excited because we like supporting local eateries. Plus I heard good reviews.

Our party of four arrived shortly after they opened for breakfast. We were one of three tables. The server was nice and promptly took our order. He forgot my drink, but no worries.

We got our cinnamon rolls right away and were off to a good start. Delicious. Then we waited. And waited. And waited for our meal. 

I could see the panic showing on the server's face as he kept looking at our table to see if the food had been delivered. It had not. Yet instead of coming by and honestly explaining there had been an issue with getting the food to the table timely (maybe it hadn't been entered, maybe the kitchen was behind), he avoided our table like the plague. No check in, no coffee refill, nothing. It wasn't until we finally lost our patience that I asked another server what was going on. She apologetically checked. She came back to say 5 more minutes. This is after watching other tables who were sat after us receive their meals.

Then the meals came out at different times. My daughter ordered the kids French toast, and while the description on the menu just says \"mini French toast\" I am certain she got the adult version...with berries, almonds, etc. I asked this other server if this was the kid version and she said yes. OK fine.

Hers came first, then my son's, then my husband's and she said enjoy and walked off. It wasn't until I flagged her down did I ask about mine. Looking surprised, she went back to check. Eventually our original server brought mine with a very lack luster \"sorry.\"

The food was good. Not amazing but not bad. In asking for the check, we did receive a 10% Yelp discount, although I never mentioned Yelp. The other server was again apologetic but by then it was too late.

I worked as a server and a bartender for years in a restaurant, also opening five restaurants for that company and managing one overseas. The FIRST thing we told servers was to be honest with guests and to do damage control when mistakes were made. At the very least, the original server, upon noticing we hadn't received our meal, should have come to the table, apologized for the mistake and offered something to tide us over or at least show he was working on it. I used to teach my staff that a gesture like that goes A LONG WAY in saving a customer. Or the manager could have come by. Or the bill could have been comped (not what I was looking for).

But nothing was done until I got upset and flagged someone, anyone down to complain. Which again, was too late at that point.

I wish them well but don't plan to return. I hope this can be used as a learning experience for the staff. We all make mistakes. But it's how mistakes get handled that makes a difference."}
{"text":"Great food and great service with no wait! My sis and I split the tempura apple pancake dish for breakfast and ordered a side of turkey bacon. The portions are huge which is why we split 1 dish. That brought the price down to a normal breakfast out, also. Chef Mike came out and checked in us. And the hostess/waitress was very nice and friendly! Same parking lot as Kitchen Table but I much more preferred Served's food."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place !! Chef even comes out to the table and checks to see if the customers are happy with their food!! I had the corned beef hash and substituted my potatoes for garlic fried rice! I loved everything about the food from the taste to the presentation."}
{"text":"Came in to find the BEST Pork Belly Burger I have ever had! The atmosphere is trendy but still comfortable. Great service staff made us feel very welcome and they were very accommodating. Chef Matt came to the table and  introduced himself and to talk food great place ....will be back!"}
{"text":"I usually do not write reviews.   However, since this place took FOREVER to bring us our food.   I figured I use this time to say how S...L...O...W  this place is.    We have been sitting here for an hour waiting and waiting.   I really don't know about the food but the wait is HORRIBLE.  We FINALLY received our food and one of the dishes was cold. Had to send it back.  It wasn't the waitresses fault. They did the best they could. I am a business owner so it is always sad to see a business doing so bad.    I hope the owner get to read this review and make improvements.    Maybe less waitresses and more cooks.    I WOULD NOT go back to this place."}
{"text":"5 stars are SERVED!

The quaint restaurant SERVED is hidden but I'm glad its found.  Chef Matt has such a creative mind when preparing his dishes.  I was happy to get a chance to speak with him about his food.  The staff are very welcoming and friendly. We were fortunate to have such an attentive waitress in Jamie.  She was great in helping us in our food selections.  

The tables are SERVED with a basket of house made chips and salsa.  I fell in love.  The chips have an amazing seasoning that are great on their own.  The salsa is so fresh.  Very light and refreshing. This girl would be happy with a meal of his chips.  

But I couldn't stop there.  A friend and I shared a few entrees - the Asian BLAT Sandwich & the Blackened Salmon Tacos.  Both unique and tasty!  The sandwich is set apart with the flavorful pork belly and miso vinaigrette arugula.  I chose it to be SERVED with sweet potato fries.  They seem to have a light tempura coating which I loved.  Again... Unique and tasty.  

The blackened salmon tacos are built with a vinegar slaw.  Very light, very flavorful! The salmon is fresh.  The mango salsa tops it off perfectly.  

I really don't know if my meal could have gone better.  SERVED is a true asset to this city."}
{"text":"If you are looking for OUT OF THE NORM and ECLECTIC food then THIS IS IT!
A place you and your guests are bound to remember.
Off the beaten path, easy to access and with plenty of free parking this place is a hidden gem.
The reason for my top rating is not for the above but for the quality and taste of the food!
This is eclectic done right!

Great combinations! - thanks for letting me adjust the kind of bread and hollandaise sauce to suit my preferences.

Great presentations! With edible flowers, stone serving platters etc.

Done right! Cooked the way it should be, not over or under.

Great staff and service! Madeleine and Candice (I hope I've spelt these names right) were Very Nice!"}
{"text":"Great, new spot in the Henderson area!

Literally about 5 mins away from work so my coworkers and I decided to take advantage and have lunch here on a Friday!

Menu full of choices! Breakfast, lunch and dinner covered! From Korean, to Filipino, to Latin, to American - seriously what more can you ask for!

I decided to try the following :
*Ono Wings & Rice - about 6 meaty wings on top of white rice, drizzled with really light teriyaki-like sauce and scallions! Also comes with Mac Salad. Simple yet comforting! I would do without the Mac Salad since I felt like the lack of flavor/taste! Other than that def a safe, must try dish!
*Pupusas - about two in one order, comes with plantain, cheese, braised beef, topped with slaw, red sauce, sunny side up egg and queso fresca! Not the traditional pupusa I've had in the past but still pretty tasty! Shredded braised beef completes the doughy pupusa and love the added egg on top too!

BIG portions, so great for sharing!

You get seasoned chips and salsa, similar to the bread and butter concept, while waiting for food!

Chef Matt, I noticed, comes to every table to make sure everyone is pleased and doing well. I think when a chef/owner shows that little gesture it makes the place just extra bit more special, shows pride and care! 

Definitely want to come back to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious, eclectic gourmet cuisine. That's what Served is all about! You want a dish with pork belly, kalbi, or longanisa, it's here.  Fried chicken? They've got it. Burgers?? Chef Matt Meyer has got it covered too. 

And it's no ordinary meal either. Chef amps it up!! Like Ono Wings...marinated, seasoned well and crisp skin, so ono! He also can modify, and takes special request if time permits. When I was sick, he offered to make me soup. How awesome is he?

Never fails when someone in our party orders the Miso Pork Belly Burger, heads turn.  Not only is it visually mouthwatering, it comes through with the quality beef used and the pork belly made to perfection...every time.  

I was in there couple weeks ago when Chef Matt said he was planning on making a Scotch Egg, BUT ..with a Filipino twist to it by using Longanisa instead of sausage. So this past weekend chef made one for me and bestie. Wow!!! I applaud the execution first of all. With the bread crumbs golden brown and the combo of the longanisa, hard boiled egg, paired with Thai Basil rice. Sensational!---Makes great yolk porn pix too apparently. I put that sucker on blast on IG that weekend.  That's why lately you've been seeing foodie'ographers ordering and taking pix of it...lol

Even it's a small restaurant, it's good for groups. Been here multiple times and they easily accommodated our impromptu Framily gathering, crying babies, toddlers and all. The tables are not cramped in. Staff and service have been fantastic. When the chef is not busy in the back, he is out in front meeting and greeting his customers.

You'll find Served in the complex across from Macdonald Ranch subdivision. It's tucked in the back left corner opposite of Kitchen Table restaurant. Cool how Chef Antonio offered his help and welcomed Served into the neighborhood as well! Love how our community supports local business! So see you soon at Served!...but make sure you save a Scotch Egg for me!"}
{"text":"Food is interesting and well executed. Very high quality. Eggs always cooked perfectly. The staff is lovely too!"}
{"text":"I can't put words together to describe the amazing flavors that they are serving here. Let me tell you this, I got served, and I will be back to get served again! Try this place, it's simply fantastic! Great people, amazing food, amazing service. Nothing but love inside these walls. Truly a great experience to be had!"}
{"text":"Although it's hard for a Healthnut to find something on this menu....it was delicious.  I had the southern bennie made with sweet cornbread on the bottom. Nice change from the typical....and that's the best thing about this place!!"}
{"text":"So amazing food was great and loved everything they had to offer
Service was awesome. Deff a great place for a  meal when you dont know what youre craving"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!!!  Great menu!  Food is unique and fun.  Atmosphere is just ok.  Wish it was at a better location since it never seems busy and it deserves the attention!"}
{"text":"Little hidden gem! This place offers s variety of breakfast and lunch dishes with a Latin/Asian twist to them. I ordered the pork belly sandwich, which was delicious, accompanied by picked veggies and jalapeño. Great portions too! The service was great, everyone is friendly and the chef tá me out to see how we were doing. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Like everyone else you need to order the pork Benedict! It is too good to be true. I am going to try to resist coming back all the time for those. It will be hard if I am showing some clients their future homes around this spot!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and I'm so glad I did. The staff was so friendly, Mark was our server. We walked in and was seated right away. The place is small but very clean and trendy looking. The menu is upscale and prices are a little more than what you might want to spend on a typical breakfast but the food is worth it and not your ordinary eggs and toast. I had Green Eggs and Spam for $15, not bad at all price wise. The eggs were scrambled with green thai butter, garlic fried rice and spam.....ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! My husband had pancakes with tempura bacon, he liked the bacon but said it was a little much. It was like a pancake fried with a piece of bacon in it. He said pancakes were great. My father in law had the Triple Decker Turkey Club. He said he loved it. The turkey is real turkey, not deli meat and it's huge. Overall our bill was $51 but I would pay that again, no problem for the amount of food, quality of food and service."}
{"text":"So this place is deceptive looking. It looks like it could be a hole in the wall - but it is far from it. Trendy food, varied clientele, and delicious food combined with great service."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the search. Location is a little hidden but not hard to find. Their food and service is top of the line. I've been here 2 times this week and I'm so glad I did. I've yet to be disappointed. Definitely check them out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went there this morning at 8:15 am. a Saturday and they're closed. How do you call yourself a breakfast and lunch spot if you open at 9? Call yourself a brunch place. Maybe I will give them a chance to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"I've been to several of the breakfast/lunch only places that have opened in the neighborhood recently. I often wondered what really differentiated them from getting breakfast at Denny's or IHOP. For most of them, the menu is fairly routine and the food is ok but nothing to write home about. None of that is true for Served. This is a fairly small restaurant ( maybe 20 tables) hidden off of Horizon Ridge Parkway. You really have to know that it's there because it is not visible from the street and could easily just drive by. At Served, the menu is anything but routine. The breakfast menu is loaded with items that you cannot get any place else and you certainly cannot make it yourself at home unless you are a Gourmet Chef. As soon as you order, they bring a basket homemade chips that are coated with cinnamon and sugar. In addition there is a side of a Nutella dipping sauce. Wow is that good. Very tempted to just eat the chips and Nutella and skip the meal. Needless to say I didn't do that. I ordered the Matt's omelet. It looks like the size of a 4 egg omelette but it is egg whites only. It is loaded with turkey, bacon (lots and lots of bacon), spinach, yellow peppers and topped with avocado. It comes with a side of potato nuggets and toast. Has to be the best omelet I've ever eaten. My buddy ordered the triple-decker club sandwich. He ordered it with a side of sweet potato fries. He loved the sandwich. But I thought the presentation was what was really spectacular. Our server, Hunter, did an outstanding job despite the fact that he's only been on the job 3 days. The restaurant manager, Jamie, came by several times to make sure everything was going well and to give us a little history of the restaurant.
This is why people go out for breakfast. Outstanding service and food that you could not prepare for yourself at home. I definitely will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Yummy, and very interestingly new! The menus on Yelp show an obvious Filipino spin on Chef Matt's menu selections..until we read on. Next, we looked at the pics, and suddenly...ooohs, whoas filled the car. The restaurant is in an unassuming spot in a strip mall, but this food doesn't belong in a strip mall...the Crispy Baked Berry French Toast is a specialty of the house and the work put into it shows..its edges were crispy and the berry syrup was good not overly sweet as one might be afraid of. The Soft Shell Crab Benedict..mmm mmm and easily a group favorite. The Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict was another favorite..the Corned Beef was definitely, or at least tasted, like it was made in house..now if you're Filipino, the Tocino Chef Matt serves up with Tocilog is worth trying..a good unique flavor that will never be confused with Orientex or other mass produced Tocino. Chef, great food! Next time I'm in town i would definitely go back. Please let me know if and when you move to another location in late spring.."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  There were six in our group, and we were all blown away by our meals.  We tried everything from burgers, sandwiches, tacos, egg bennies and the Korean BBQ plate.  Not a one of us was disappointed.  The chef nailed it and stopped by our table a couple of times to check in with us.  Service was great, we were not rushed, all of our meals had amazing flavor and presentation, and cannot wait to try this place again."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Service is slow. Understandable it's Sunday brunch and the food is going to take awhile. It wasn't my first time here and server never offered chips and salsa which had always been complimentary in previous visits. Than waiting for 15 mins to order is another downgrade. Brunch arrived and everything was great. Fast forward waiting another 15 mins for the check. This would've been alright if it was large restaurant. But with only 12-4 top tables and 4 servers that is unacceptable. Again awesome food but service is in slow motion."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner there a couple of weeks ago. My filet was fantastic, great service and lived the deserts. A little hard to find but don't give up you won't be disappointed. Go to Serve."}
{"text":"Business lunch on Friday and the place was empty. It is a sign of poor quality - NO. Food was great, service quick. Chef came out checking on us. Had their special of the day. It was plenty of food and tasted very good. Hopefully they'll extend their hours soon so it will be good place for dinner as well."}
{"text":"Three stars. Expectations were high from me coming in due to the great reviews about this place. We left this place feeling uncomfortable, uneasy, & heavy, not in a full stomach way. Heavy as in energy-wise. The energy in this place is really, really low. It did not give us a good dining experience. I truly wanted to give this place a great review but i just could not. I will give credit when credit is due & based on my history of reviews, I will also fairly give a negative review when it's due. 
Our server Cassandra was an exception. She was sweet, nice, & patient with this patron especially after I told her that it's our first time in their establishment. 
There were two people, Jaimie and Phil who approached our table, well, Jamie just kind of talked to us in passing, & each of them explained why it was so slow. We were the only people who were there at the time (see video) & there were two older couple who was there when arrived. They said it was because of the \"It's a beautiful life\" event that may be causing the slow turns and that the young people who frequent their establishment are all still asleep with hang overs, either way, we did not care why they were slow. It just felt like there was so much explanation being made to justify why we were the only patrons there. IT REALLY WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. Not to mention just how eerily quiet it was in there. Talking in low voices seemed like the whole place could hear our conversation. 
The food, however, was good. We ordered and shared the Pork belly benedict and the crispy blueberry french toast and the flavors of these dishes were good. But sometimes good food coupled by a negative familiarity do not make for a stellar experience. 
I TRULY HOPE THAT THEY WILL ONLY IMPROVE AND GET BUSIER BECAUSE \"SERVE\" HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL."}
{"text":"This place was seriously a big surprise! The staff was amazing and the food, no words can describe! I had the panang salmon, and I swear, it was by far one of the best meals I have EVER had! I never finish everything on my plate in 1 sitting... well, I did this time! It was perfect! My bf had the Wellington burger... simply out of this world! I can't wait to go back and be surprised again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The decor is nice, the server was so friendly and attentive, and the food was to die for! My friends and I went for a late weekday breakfast, and the menu is very unique. We had a hard time deciding what to get. They bring out complimentary cinnamon sugar chips with a Nutella dip that is amazing! I had a custom 4 item omelette with the most amazing maple bacon in it. It was a huge portion with a side of potatoes. One friend had the crispy baked berry French toast, which was delicious and had homemade whipped cream on top. The other friend had the breakfast sandwich, which was also delicious and had that same maple bacon on it. It's a worthwhile trip just for the bacon! Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and exceptional service. Chef Matt has created a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Had the 3-item Custom Burger with avocado, cheddar and fried egg. It was delicious!!! And they even stayed open a few minutes late so I could pick up my order. The staff was friendly, the portions are generous and the atmosphere is wonderful. I also recommend the sweet potato fries, yummy!"}
{"text":"Service is wonderful, chef is very nice, comes out to greet every guest after they receive their meal. The food is beyond phenomenal and the presentation is gorgeous. A snack comes out first while waiting for food, that's always amazimg as well. We come here at least once a month
 Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I only ate here once and will probably make an effort to eat here again for another special occasion (price wise it is out of my budget to eat here frequently). I had the tempura apple pancakes which was delicious. I only wish that the apples didn't have the skin on then I would have enjoyed it more. Portion was big and the pancakes were simple just the way I like them. 

I love the potato nuggets. Crispy, seasoned potato skins generously sprinkled over roasted potato nuggets. My friend had a Filipino breakfast dish which she enjoyed. 

Here is some tip:
   If you are coming with more than 4 people, or special occasion, make a reservation. This restaurant is small and you might be waiting long if you just walk in. Especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"A kind of odd looking restaurant in a nondescript ambiguous shopping center. But don't let that fool you. Inside is a trendy looking establishment with tasty food and excellent staff. Limited but unusual and well done fare"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Varied menu reasonably priced. Outstanding service. Chef visited table. Had Banana croissant French toast that was amazing. Will return to this hidden neighborhood find."}
{"text":"Wow, truly a hidden gem. This place is worth checking out! Excellent food served on unconventional plates. How fun is that? Place is cozy and quiet; perfect if you want to avoid busy areas.

My kid had the green eggs and spam. 5 stars in his book. I had the corned beef hash and eggs, with portions crisped to perfection, served on a slate. 5 stars. Wifey had the tocilog Filipino breakfast - beats your typical filipino joints that serve breakfast. - 5 stars.

This place is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and the food is so good that we wud love to come back again in this short  period of time we have during this trip. Highly recommend the food. Looking Forward to another trip here again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and fresh service was excellent. I recommend the chicken and waffles and the daily Mac n cheese"}
{"text":"Nice spot tucked back off the street. Decor is really nice. An upscale breakfast brunch place. Found it on a whim. Brought my 6 and 12 year old sons for pancakes and they did not disappoint. 
The server works the entire room of 8-10 tables and she was efficient, friendly and helpful. The menu has the specialized breakfast fare with some fine twists. If you're looking for straight down the middle breakfast this isn't it. Glazed bacon, interesting (and tasty) potatoes, thick cut corned beef hash... this is breakfast with a posh side.
I go 4 stars because I get the sense they are trying a bit too hard to be upscale. It's okay to ha e some standard items for the kids. Hot chocolate, apple juice and regular bacon is a good start. I'll be back but probably with some business clients. When it comes to the kids I will look elsewhere only because of the menu choices."}
{"text":"Service was amazing.  First time here didn't know what to get but our server TROI broke the menu down to us pretty good.  My boyfriend got the Wellington burger let's just say he ate it all.  I got the tocilog made with pork belly that was pretty good too.  Excited to return here to try the rest of the menu. It's very different and delicious. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I had brunch at Served today.  The soft shell crab was delicious and our waiter Robert couldn't have served us better!  The Chef/OWNER Matthew Meyer came to our table to see if everything was to our liking.  You really should try this place,  I know you will return again and again like I do!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype at this establishment. Hubby, son and I tried this place out for brunch because we were really intrigued with their menu. It's located in a really low key plaza and the place itself is very clean. The server was very friendly. Hubby ordered pork belly benedict. I got the tocino, which was made in house, and egg plate. We ordered my son a burger with sweet potato fries. Pork belly benedict was average, I felt like a lot of the appeal of this place has to do with how they plate their food but in my honest opinion I feel like it was doing too much. The tocino was good, but I felt like it was so fatty I wasn't left with much desirable meat to be eaten. My 14 month olds kids meal was probably the best dish on our table. The burger was wonderfully made and the shoe string sweet potato fries were delicious. I feel like it was overpriced and the quality of food did not justify the prices. We were told that they do a happy house with tapa style dishes that we want to come back for. Until then, three stars. Glad I tried it but probably won't come back unless it's for trying happy hour."}
{"text":"Ingredients for a perfect Sunday - brunch with the hubby and Served! This was our second time here and it has become one of my favorite brunch spots. Service is excellent, the food is delicious and offers an elevated take on \"simple\" dishes.

I've had spam and rice at least 100 times during my lifetime, but I've never had it like this! Salty and a little spicy, the flavors work so well together. I love a good homemade jam, so of course we ordered the toast and seasonal jam. Lastly, their brewed mango iced tea is refreshing and a great compliment to any meal.

The decor is modern and simple, yet the small space still feels inviting. As with other great brunch spots on this side of town, I only wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and the food was pretty good, service needs a little work though. We were greeted immediately upon entering, although the hostess/waitress looked at us a little weird, I am not sure if she was busy or what, but I got the feeling she assumed we were two little kids coming in to eat ( I look very young for my age and I took my little brother with me), she stared at us for a little while before asking if we wanted a table. The place is larger than other places around the same area (such as Kitchen Table), good for large parties too. Water was brought out immediately, drinks were not listed on the menu and we were not asked if we wanted something else besides the water, the lady who sat us came back and asked if we were ready to order. The waitress was pretty friendly but it seems that they were under-staffed so she did not really pay attention to us. Pretty much took our order, delivered our food then gave us our check. Our water was not re-filled either. 

The chefs did come to each table and asked if everything tasted good which was a nice touch. 

I got the Soft Shell Crab Benedict which was pretty good. The biscuits were soft on the inside and grilled crispy on the outside, so buttery and fluffy. The hollandaise was not too creamy, the crab was pretty big and very crispy. The breakfast potatoes were cold when served, overall pretty good dish. 

My brother got the Pork Belly Miso Burger with Mac Salad and this was also pretty good. The patty was thick and cooked medium, the pork belly was a BIG flap of pork belly, not thinly sliced... a very big and thick burger. 

Pretty good food, would probably come back to try other items if I am around, hopefully they are fully staffed next time. The place was also on the warmer side, it felt a little stuffy, good thing it is nice outside, I think the place will be pretty hot and stuffy during the summer."}
{"text":"Served is a hidden gem that is absolutely delicious. I have eaten here at least 6 separate times and their food is always outstanding. They take a personal touch on everything and add their own flair to meals making for a truly unique and enriching dining experience.

We had a great great server named Cassandra who was extremely helpful friendly and knowledgeable. We enjoyed the appetizer of cinnamon chips and banana Nutella, which was delicious.

Now for the main course.

We enjoyed orange and guava juice mimosas, both of which were delicious and water melon juice. This was some superb water melon juice.

This particular occasion we dined upon the special that was a prime rib sloppy joe sandwich with horse radish macaroni salad on the sandwich itself.  The truffle Parmesan potatoes on the side were glorious! 

This place is truly spectacular and has a great welcoming vibe the minute you walk in.

One cannot forget their absolutely delicious bottomless mimosa options. If you are ever in the area, you need to look up Served. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, really great food and awesome service. Loved panang curry. Lemon chicken was great too. Hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"The service was spectacular. The food was phenomenal. We ordered a portobello Benedict and a pork belly Benedict. Both beyond surpassed our expectations. You have to try Chef Matt's homemade jam... I asked if they sold it by the jar and they are hoping to soon. So delicious! This was a quiet restaurant, perfect for a lazy Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly. Tacos were phenomenal and I'm picky with tacos for sure made my top 3 of best tacos I've had. Seafood so fresh it was refreshing. My boyfriend ordered the Miso Pork Belly Burger, it was huge but was so delicious he had to finish it. Our server, Manny, was one of the best servers we've had and was the cherry on top to our experience at Served. Very satisfied with this restaurant, plan on coming here each month with our routine trip to Henderson."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch. The service was definitely lacking. Although the waiter was attentive and friendly, we had to wait a long time to get the food (even though the place was half empty), we ordered a side that never came out, and upon reading yelp reviews before posting this I learned apparently they have complimentary cinnamon chips? Never got those. However, I give it so many stars because the food was AWESOME. Perhaps a little overpriced ($25 for a Benedict is a little much, even if it is short rib). That being said, I'm always willing to pay more for food if it's good, and it was. I went back and forth between giving it 3 or 4 stars because the service really was not good. Ultimately decided on 4 because the quality of the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Ono chicken wings were excellent! Had the shrimp tempura po boy, fish tacos, and spinach salad. Everything was delicious... will definitely come back! Kudos to Chef Matt!"}
{"text":"Solid food offerings. We tried it for the first time because my DH is craving meat. He got the Tillamook burger. It was so good (I took a bite ;)) the crispy Tillamook cheese was phenomenal. 

I got the soft shell crab tempura poboy and it was good. I don't know if it's worth $20 but it's good. 

Also DH ordered their Bloody Mary. It has bacon in it and it's sooo delicious  

Seems like they have a good happy hour menu too. 

We will come back!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find, the food presentation was first class and the food had an incredible burst of flavors . The short ribs are the best breakfast I have had in town. Go for the Soul  Bennie"}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say about this place. I was looking for a place to eat and I found this place on what other place then Yelp! 

There's plenty of parking at this location and it was packed at all when we went around 12p. The restaurant has a nice ambiance too it. I really liked the look of the place. The staff is nice and I really liked how the chef came out and talked to some of the customers. To me, that means a lot for a chef to come out of the Kitchen. 

The pricing ranges from $9 to about $25. The food is amazing here. I ordered the burger with pork belly on top with potatoes and it was ONO! I had to cut it in half or it was too big for me to eat. The beef patty was very juicy and tender and everything just went well together. Here's the link to there website.

http://servedlv.com

Again, If you're ever in the area, go check this place out! I wish we had Served in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Had a special occasion that the Chef opened just for our work party, this is a gem with so many interesting flavors! The barbacoa pupusa was delicious, short rib was tender."}
{"text":"They have extremely cool menu options! Great breakfast food with a Filipino twang on some of the entrees. Didn't get to try any of their lunch options but I'm excited to go back and try them. Food was very good and the service was lovely. I ordered the huevos rancheros and my sister ordered green eggs and spam, they were both delightful. The hostess and waiters were very attentive and friendly. The Chef came out served the food himself and came out a second time to make sure we enjoyed our meal, so it was overall a great experience."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in town. Great service and the food was amazing. It was great to have the Chef come out and ask if we're happy with our meal. Will definitely go back. BbQ burger was amazing. Definitely recommend everyone to try it."}
{"text":"Awesome tabling and unusual menu combinations. Have tried a little of everything from tempura tacos to chilli cheeseburger to the French toast. It's all worth a try. 

If you're looking for something good and different than most restaurants, this is a great place."}
{"text":"I really love this place, especially when Chef Matt is cooking--it's definitely better. Served has a wonderfully diverse menu that reminds me of mom's cooking with the great flavors, but sophistication of a very talented chef. Faves: Pork Belly Benedict, Ono Wings, Pork Belly Tacos, Pork Belly Burger, Bahn Mi. All the pork belly dishes are divine, as are the benedicts. The berry french toast is to die for. Honestly, I have loved pretty everything I've tried. Only thing I'm not a big fan of is the potato chunks. Sometimes I just crave fries with my burger."}
{"text":"Go to this place now!  Served is a quaint little spot in Henderson with a chef who has big ideas and the skill set to pull them off splendidly.  The restaurant is quaint and rather small which is totally fine as it seems more inviting this way.  I happened to go on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all which rocked.  The service was great and waitress was very attentive and kind.  She told us a bit about the place and the chef and how he makes just about everything from scratch which was pretty awesome to hear.
Now to the food.  It rocked!  I got the miso pork burger which I assumed to be a burger made of pork but it turns out the miso pork came on top of the burger which made it stand about 66 inches or so tall.  Literally every bite oozed juice, that's how well it was made.  It was outstanding and the mac salad on the side was quite refreshing and a good accompaniment.  The rest of my group got the tempura shrimp po'boy, the banh mi, and the berry french toast, all of which, according to them, were fantastic as well.   
I don't know if it's because it wasn't that busy or because this is just how he is but the chef came over and welcomed us after our meal and thanked us for eating there, asked us how we enjoyed it, and if we needed anything else which was an extremely kind gesture.  I am definitely going back here and want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great place! Went in on a Saturday morning and was seated right away. Ordered food from the menu however the chef was trying out new creations and offered my husband and I a sample! Happily surprised!"}
{"text":"This out of the way breakfast spot has a great variety of dishes to choose from. From your typical breakfast sandwiches to some tasty Salvadorian and Filipino dishes, which I was not expecting. 

Being Filipino ourselves, my mom and I decided to order the Longsilog, which is a traditional Filipino breakfast sausage dish. The sausage(longanisa) was delicious and meaty. It also had a slight charring on the outside, like it was cooked over a grill. Not typically how it's served, but tasty nonetheless. The longanisa was served with three eggs, garlic rice, garlic vinegar, and a side of atchara(pickled papaya). I feel the dish could have used more rice, but that could be just because I liked the rice so much. We also ordered a side of Kim Chee, it was pretty mild. 

And I can't recommend their cucumber juice enough!  Light and refreshing, it reminded me of honeydew. Perfect end to my meal. 

Overall, great place. Service was quick and attentive from both the servers and chefs. I look forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"This is a must go to restaurant  Lunch this time. A hamburger from heaven cooked and seasoned perfectly. 12 Oz
Patty with lettuce tomato onion pickles AND Cheddar cheese was my choice OMG mind blowing sweet potato fries.If you like M's burger you will LOVE THESE. My wife would not try another dish she was enraptured with their crispy French toast.
I watched the attentive staff go from table to table to check on needs always responding to requests with NOT A PROBLEM. To top it off chef matt comes out to ensure he hit the mark.Let me tell you he hits the BULLSEYE."}
{"text":"The lomo saltado and corned beef hash was outstanding! Our server Jean was very courteous and I love how the chef walked up to see how our food was. Only problem is that they should be open later hours so I can come back for dinner. Delicious! Will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"One of those places that isn't smacked dap in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. Its remote but cozy. Very smooth atmosphere, casual and simple decor. Walking in the host greeted us and sat us down very promptly. Service was very attentive, nice, and on point with our order. Wellington burger was on point! Not overly complicated with a bunch of random stuff on it. Medium rare the way it should be. Swiss cheese, wild mushrooms and above all sunny side egg. Liquid gold that just gave it extra push of deliciousness. Chef came out to see how everything was which at a lot of places I don't usually see. I would definitely take a trip back here to have another food experience like the one I had at Served."}
{"text":"We saw this place on yelp and thought we'd give it a try. Unfortunately, yelp also lead us to believe it was all day breakfast but that's not the case (breakfast ends at 2pm). That was no problem, however! 

We tried the loaded potato nuggets (Which were only 5$ since it was happy hour.), the bimbimbap, the french onion soup, and the shrimp tempura tacos! All the food was absolutely delicious. The galbi in the bimbimbap was amazing and the shrimp tempura was nice and crispy.

I think the bacon in the potato nuggets was candied since it was slightly sweet, which I loved since it added a little something different. 

Since it was dinner, they gave bread with a green chile ,poblano butter spread. That was amazing. 

Service was good, our waitress was really sweet. Definitely need to come back to try breakfast, soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food! Colossal tip of the hat to the owners of this establishment, recommend this as a breakfast lunch and dinner destination"}
{"text":"Delicious and wonderful food presentations. The servers were extremely friendly and Chef Matt personally came out to make sure the food was cooked perfectly for us. He even asked us how we could improve the food. That shows real passion for what he does. I just love the concept that you can get food from around the world. I had the longsilog which is Filipino sausage (longanisa) with garlic fried rice, 3 eggs, and pickled veggies. Yum! I'm always into a place that offers food that my mom used to make. You can also get Mexican, Thai, and Korean food there too. They will be offering dinner service soon. I'll definitely be back for that! Please support this new business! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is overpriced. $16 for French toast and $20 for Salmon Benedict you're better off on going to a regular diner like Baby Stacks where there are no frills and items are reasonably priced . The food wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't amazing and for the money you're paying I was expecting more."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough off this place!!!!
My breakfast, brunch and lunch options were outstanding.... But now they have a happy hour 7 days a week, 2-6pm!!!!! Great sampling of happy hour foods!  
My all time favorite is chef's corned beef hash for brunch.  Best I've had!  EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"First visit. I had the soft shell crab eggs Benedict; it is incredible. Great menu selection and service is excellent. Great tasting coffee."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday 03/31 at 10:30 am ish. We were looking for a new breakfast spot to eat while being on our vacation and this place caught our attention on Yelp. We got seated right away as we walked in. The server was really friendly and answered all of the questions about the food that we were confused about. Then we put in our orders. I'm not sure if the restaurant was short staffed today but the food came out longer than we expected. It probably took about 30-40 mins for our food. One of the reason why it didn't get 5 stars from me. The server was working by herself and she was doing a very good job. Maybe they were short staff in the front too because I noticed the staff in the back started coming up to the front and help her. Great job to the team work there. I would most likely coming back but there should another server in the front to help the poor girl out because it was busy morning! Food was delicious! I will come back again to update my review!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! The location and overall scenery in and outside is a little sketchy. But the food was amazing and very unique! Definitely recommend you try it if you are the type to try new things!"}
{"text":"We came here around 5ish in the afternoon and found ourselves being the only customers on a Saturday night. We chose our seat and was greeted by our server Troy. I tell you.. he has the best customer service my fiancé and I have ever encountered. He helped us choose the most popular dishes on the menu. We ended up getting kimchi galbi fries as our appetizer.. huge portion! My fiancé ordered the miso burger which was a 16oz steak with flavored pork belly in their special sauce and refreshing arugula!! I ordered the Peruvian lomo Saltado which was pieces of beef, caramelized onions, cherry tomatoes and plantains and topped with 2 sunny side eggs. Delicious stuff!
We loved how the chef kept checking in on us asking for our opinion on his dishes. 
What I love most about this restaurant is the fusion of different cultures and flavors that the chef has created. I almost wanted to cry when eating our food."}
{"text":"I hate to give three stars to any restaurant but this is what yelp is for... honest reviews. 
This place is a little local spot which made the prices a little unexpected. 
- Soft Shell Crab Benedict $20 ... there was such a small amount of crab that I could not understand the $20 for basically an eggs benedict with no meat. The sliced potatoes were the best part of that dish. 
- Apple Pie Tempura Pancakes $12. The portion size was large and it came with tempura fried slices of green apples. The pancakes themselves were good but the sauce from the green apples was pretty sour. We ate about a third because we were hungry but didn't take the left overs. 
- Fried Chicken and Cornbread French Toast $12. It's possible the menu said how many pieces of chicken and french toast but it was under entree so expected and entree. What came out was three regular to small size chicken wings and three fast food sized French toast sticks. This should not be served as a meal but rather as an appetizer... maybe. I was the only person that ate from this plate and was sick to my stomach most of the day after the meal.  
- Watermelon juice was the juice of the day and we left two cups of it untouched because, well, it just wasn't good. I think we paid $13 for a small and a large juice. 
The chef did come out after our meal and ask how everything was... I didn't say anything about the food to him because I knew there would be nothing else on the menu I would want to try and I was not feeling well by that point. Spending $75 on a meal (after the drinks and tip) and feeling slightly nauseous and still hungry after, will leave anyone writing a mediocre review.  I chalk this place up as \"not for us\" and keep it moving."}
{"text":"Slow and disorganized. Walked in as party of two on a Saturday afternoon, the guy who greeted us was nice and said 15 minute wait with two parties ahead. No problem but then we noticed a lot of empty uncleaned tables, the wait staff running around in circles, loud music and shouting coming from the kitchen. The people in front of us got seated and sat and sat and sat with just water to show for it. Then a party of four comes in saying the had a reservation which was for over 15 minutes ago and they seat those people right away. We left and went to kitchen table, got seated and food ordered within 10 minutes of leaving served."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and served very quickly even for our party of 8. The only thing lacking was a bigger selection of juices. ...cranberry, pineapple  ect. Can't forget to mention the cornbeef hash was incredible! We will be back."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4x now. I think this place deserves a bigger better location. The menu continues to grow Every time I go in. I always get the Turf Benedict -something like that - it's so good every time I get it I can't stop ordering it to try something new. I also enjoy the cinnamon chips with the pudding dip they give to you. I haven't ever been during lunch so it's never been busy.. the chef always has came to ask how we liked our food and I find that as great service. Awesome place overall!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  Coming back from Boulder city we simply lucked out and found this place for lunch.   While we enjoyed a place almost to ourselves, I fully expect it to be packed next time we come to visit.  And we'll definitely come back!   We had Cesar salad, shrimps Po-boy sandwich and chicken wings.  Everything was delicious, and chicken wings were \"awesome\" according to our 11 y.o.- and that's high praise coming from him :)"}
{"text":"I was visiting the area to scope out rentals as I plan on moving to the area soon and came across this restaurant on Yelp. I really enjoy unique food fusions so that's why I decided on trying this place out as my first bite to eat, but I decided to get the Crispy Baked Berry French Toast. (The menu states, \"variations of a cinnamon apple available upon request,\" but I was told they actually don't do that anymore so I went ahead and ordered it as is). Although I am not a huge fan of berries in general, I actually found the balance to work out well and enjoyed every bite. 

The host was kind, the waitress was very attentive, and the chief did a great job with the food and making sure we were happy. 

The restaurant inside is somewhat limited seating so I could see it being rather crowded on weekends. It's a somewhat upscale place, but I noticed baby/toddler chairs stacked in the corner so they are kid friendly. Depending on how crowded they are would probably determine if I would bring my toddler though due to it's size and overall feel of the restaurant. I will most definitely be returning though."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is out of this world. Came for lunch on Tuesday and back for breakfast on Thursday. Everyone needs to try this restaurant. Lunch had hot dipped turkey. Today pancakes with tempura bacon.  Husband had green eggs and spam!!!"}
{"text":"Served: 
Now open for Breakfast, Lunch and DINNER, so there is no excuse , treat yourself and let chef Matthew Meyer take your palate on a magical mystery tour of delicious delight.
The ambience is casual but the menu is explosive with culinary combinations that will have you salivating in curiosity. A fusion of foods where east meets west. 
The servers beam with pride as they present you with artistic succulence. Savour the presentation before experiencing a harmony of tastes that melt in your mouth. Your tastebuds will dance in rapture with each forkful."}
{"text":"interesting food. If your vegetarian tell the chef to make something special and unique for you. He won't disappoint."}
{"text":"AWSOME and different selection. Glad we opted to come here. Corn beg and hash plate was phenomenal. Shrimp and pasta again great. We will definitely be back. Oh yea the chips and salsa are unbelievable. We will definitely be back. Thx served"}
{"text":"This looks like it will be our new breakfast and brunch go to spot, the food was great and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. My wife really enjoyed the Filipino dish that she had and the soft crab Benedict was also delicious, if you go here then I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"A true gem!  Food and service are top notch.  Do yourself a favor and check out Served!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome brunch here. The bennys are legit and the bacon is amazing. Soft Shell Crab Benedict and the Turf and Surf were both different and tasty. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"No joke this was one of the most delicious restaurants in this area.  Went with 3 friends yesterday to celebrate a friends birthday and were very surprised how yummy it was...all 4 of us really enjoyed our meals.  They have vegetarian and non vegetarian food. Check their hours...I don't believe they are open for dinner...yet.
Will absolutely go again."}
{"text":"After just a moment reviewing the menu you'll get the idea that this place is run by the chef...and you'll be right.  We've enjoyed a total of six different dishes and each was more delicious and flavorful than the last.  I have noticed over the course of the last month the crowds are building and I expect the wait to soon become as intolerable as its neighbor Kitchen Table, but I guess that is the price one must pay for truly good food."}
{"text":"Upon picking me up from the airport last weekend, my best friend wanted to take me to this super cute brunch spot called The Kitchen Table. Well, as luck would have it, The Kitchen Table had an hour wait and I was HANGRY. We began searching Yelp, looking for something close. Served popped up, less than a quarter of a mile away. We went there instead and boy, am I glad we did!

We were sat immediately and waited on by Mark. He was attentive and informative throughout our entire visit. He told us all about the mimosas, the complimentary cinnamon sugar chips & nutella dip and a little about himself also.

With the company of my best friend, my guava mimosa and the sweet, sugary chips and dip, I was on cloud 9 - it couldn't have gotten better! But it did. The food came out promptly and cooked to order! I had the green eggs & spam...OMG! Best brunch dish EVER!

Overall, 150% satisfied with my A+++ experience. I am so glad I missed out on The Kitchen Table."}
{"text":"Came here after an eye procedure and the food was to die for. It's hidden in a shopping center under construction. But you should definitely go and try this location. The chief comes and greets you as well as hand delivers the food. The presentation was beautiful as well as the taste of the meal. Will be back"}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful the food is to die for the service was so amazing and to have the chef come out and check on everyone was the greatest. They only thing I could say is that I wished they were opened all day so I can come for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Best place to eat. Love love love"}
{"text":"I love the food here!  We had longsilog, pork belly Benedict, and pious a topped with beef and egg! The service was awesome, even the Chef came out to say hello! The atmosphere here is amazing, definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I had the miso pork belly burger and the thing is huge! I could only finish half of it but it was delicious. The presentation of the food looks good. Since its a new restaurant it is a bit understaffed I think. It took a little long for the food to come out."}
{"text":"The food was great, a tad pricey, and service was very friendly but a tad slow. Had to look around for our waiter to take our order. Given they were a little bit busy, it was understandable. We had to wait for decaf coffee to be brewed and was never offered a refill. My mom who got regular coffee was offered a refill though. Overall great place and would come back for the breakfast."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, server was personable and chef came out to our table! Delicious food and FULL menu! I was nervous about the quantity and variety on the menu at first...I am sometimes under the impression of quality over quantity. However, everything that came out of the kitchen was delicious. 

I went in a group of three. As an appetizer, we got an order of the Lumpia Fillipino Eggrolls...Very tasty and served with a sweet chili sauce and vinegar mixture. Entrees--I ordered the pupusa...It was a perfect portion and was beautiful. A cheese pupusa with a nice helping of braised beef and a perfectly poached egg. Another ordered the kabocha curry--large portion but DELICIOUS. The crunchy, battered and fried kabocha squash paired nicely with the creamy curry sauce and rice. YUM. Lastly, the avocado pancakes were ordered. My two acquaintances really liked them...they tasted \"homemade\" (thank goodness right?! ha) and were very fluffy. However, I was unimpressed...seemed too standard. I was expecting something much more out of the box when the menu says \"Avocado pancakes\".

This is a great restaurant in an unfortunate location. Needs more foot traffic and more successful businesses around it."}
{"text":"I can't review the food because I called to make reservations and they kept me on hold for over 7 minutes and hung up on me. If you are going to ask your customer to make phone reservations, perhaps you should implement better phone service."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to leave the comfort of our neighborhood and trek 30 minutes to celebrate my mother's birthday at this tucked away gem. 

First thing to note is that they recently started serving dinner which was beyond amazing. The food is fresh, flavorful and extremely thoughtful. We were a party of 8 and each of us ordered something different. The steak was well prepared including the burger. My uncle had the enchiladas which he literally devoured in 5 minutes. My dad ordered the tacos with kimchi rice which he said was fresh and nicely spiced. My mother had the shrimp pasta which not only looked stunning but was cooked perfectly. 

Now for my dish, I ordered the Kabocha curry with rice and spring veggies. I was stingy and only allowed my mom to have a piece since after all... she's the birthday girl. The curry is fragrant and works well with the tempura fried squash and rice. I also ordered a side of kimchi which I ate on its own. 

The service down to the desert and attention to detail really made tonight special. The chef and his staff are exceptionally kind and rounded out our experience. We discussed visiting again for Served's famed brunches. 

If I were to describe the cuisine I'd say it's refined, culturally influenced and very thought out. There are menu options for a spectrum of foodies. 

Thank you to the chef and his team (I forgot the name of the young lady who ran the door - she's so sweet!!) My mom really enjoyed her birthday!"}
{"text":"We found this place on our way out of Las Vegas.  It was incredible!  Extremely creative menu.  Really nicely decorated interior, with very friendly and attentive staff.  The meals we had were excellent, I had the pork belly eggs Benedict, and my husband had a shrimp tempura poor boy.  We both loved our food.  The red potatoes on my plate were sooo good, I had to ask the Chef how they were done. We had excellent fresh squeezed orange juice and the coffee was great also.
 It's a fairly new restaurant and the chef owner was out of the kitchen checking in on people, and asking how everything was.  Lovely person, and very talented,  I hope this takes off, I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, and delicious food! The Asian influences and fusion were so original! I am Filipino and Japanese, and my fiancé is Filipino - my fiancé loved the longanisa tacos, and I enjoyed the shrimp tempura slider and kimchi fried rice -SO YUMMY! The owner/chef comes out to say hi to everyone - he is very friendly and personable. Our dining experience was very enjoyable, and we will be telling all of our friends to come here. We will be back! Thank you Served!"}
{"text":"So once again, thank you yelp for showing all the amazing food photos of a place and making me \"have\" to go there... oh and for already knowing what I want to order before I even step foot inside. The hubs and I  (Ok, ... I) tried this place out on a Saturday and I was excited to try the long silong based solely on yelp photos and reviews. The space was really small, though tidy, and there were only 2 other tables occupied. I have to agree with some of the reviews on service, was a quite a wait for drinks, especially when there was no one there. Our server was friendly, though, and have recommendations when asked, so  we ordered and waited. And waited. And waited. When we figured that surely the food would arrive any minute we received chips with paprika and salsa. Hubs loved them, unfortunately they were way too spicy for me. When our food finally arrived, he had three barbacoa Benedict, it was beautiful and the portions were huge. Unfortunately for me the garlic rice was way, way, way too garlicky for my taste (and I have always believed there is no such thing as too much garlic!). The sausage was AMAZING though. It came with a side of vinegar and the other server I pulled aside (couldn't find ours, in fact she never checked on us at all) when I asked what it was for said she drowns her sausage in it, and what a great tip, wad delicious. 
All in all it was a nice place, but I had to leave 3 stars because of the lack of attention by service (ours at least), and the fact that I could only eat 1/2 of my meal. I couldn't even say anything about the rice because the first time we saw our server after ordering was after my husband had already finished, there was no point. I will probably give this place another try and will ammend my review if it changes, and I hope it does because this spot has potential and I love small businesses."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!

This place is absolutely amazing. The food is fresh, delicious, and authentic. The servers were very attentive; they always kept our glasses filled and checked up on us constantly. I came here with my husband and his family and we were a group of 14. While we waited for our food, the chef gave us complimentary chips and salsa and THE BEST chicken wings ever made. My husband got the Longsilog and Korean tacos and I got the breakfast pupusas. We were very impressed with the customer service; the chef/owner even gets out on the floor serving food and chatting with his clients. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service needs a lot work. Not a place i would crave but they have some interesting options. I would go back just not run to it. They really need to work on the service and the time it takes to get your order. We were sitting outside on a very hot Henderson/Vegas day and felt pretty ignored."}
{"text":"outstanding is all i have to say. super friendly and fun staff and the chef came over and personally greeted us and even gave my boyfriend a suggestion. and then came back and made sure he loved it! the food was beyond words. they even gave us these little cinnamon sugar chips with banana nutella dip that were out of this world! think about it..what brunch place gives you appetizers like some give you bread or chips? no where! that was such a fun little teaser to help tide us over. they were so good we could have filled up just on that. the food was not only incredible, but also prepared and presented beautifully. i was blown away by this place. i will absolutely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of local small restaurants because we have so few memorable ones in Vegas. Served feels like a small restaurant it's easy to get behind. The chef comes out and asks how the meal was, the service is efficient and friendly and the location is where people live. Not on the strip or downtown. All pluses to me. The food goes bold. In my book that's a big plus. Even if it isn't a perfect result more restaurants need to get more creative. Too many in Vegas go for the boring, easy route. 

Having said all that, I felt the vibe of the restaurant as a bit lacking. Maybe if they had a bar with a tv or a brighter decor it would help. It does feel a bit dark in there. But that's a minor criticism. 

Coffee is tasty and I tried the soft shell crab Benedict. I think the execution on it was excellent. It has flavor and a good crisp crab. I really enjoyed the Benedict muffin. Tasted fluffy and freshly made. I didn't love the potatoes. A bit mushy. Next time I think I'll ask if they can make them crispier and then those would be perfect. I didn't love the crab Benedict. It was a bit heavy for me. But that could a personal taste, not an indictment of the dish. I want to comeback and try a simpler dish next time. I'm hoping they have turkey sausage or something healthy I can get next time. That's the only way I could come here regularly. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My first impression of Served was not good. The place was small, the prices seemed expensive and the place smelled really bad, like sewer gas. We actually almost left because of the smell.
However, after they delivered our food I was blown away. The presentation was amazing and the food tasted fantastic. The pupusas was awesome, I'd definitely recommend it. It all goes to show, a good chef beats everything else."}
{"text":"Found this place on a whim and it didn't disappoint.  Has a variety of options to choose from.  A bit on the pricey side.  But, if the food is good then I consider the value to be there.  In this case it was worth it.  We ordered the Green Eggs and spam (GR&S) and the Korean Fried Chicken (KFC).  The GR&S matched the namesake served over a garlic rice with a side of delicious ginger slaw and a vinegar sauce.  The garlic rice was simple tasty, very good. Wasn't sure what to do with the vinegar. Only issue was the eggs were unevenly cooked and not to they way I ordered them.  I ordered over medium and one came out over hard and one over easy. The KFC was topped with amazing Kim Chi and served with a side of crispy seasoned potatoes and skin that were very good.  I would recommend this restaurant to any self proclaimed foody or anyone looking to try food off the normal beaten path."}
{"text":"Watermelon bottomless Mimosas! All we tried was great: Bento box, Curry, Salmon tacos, Shrinp Tempura tacks and Chipotle Chicken tacos were good."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant so far! Amazing food! Is a small restaurante but is everithing 5 starts"}
{"text":"Great breakfast for ppl who enjoy something different; more for foodies. Not your standard breakfast at all. Very creative flavors and the plates are beautiful."}
{"text":"A very nice little brunch place with Asian twist the typical breakfast foods. The service was excellent and the chef even came out to talk with us!  They give you cinnamon chips to start.  Had the huevos rancheros and the tempura pancakes.  We even got to try the berry french toast!  Out of everything the French Toast was the best but everything tasted good.  It is on the pricey side but the portion side is generous. Will have to stop by for lunch sometime to try that menu!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The chef goes the extra mile with incredible delicious flavors! The menu has a wide variety and includes the freshest ingredients. It is so refreshing to go to a place that pays attention to detail, taking pride in what they serve. Finally a great place to eat that isn't a \"chain\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Served is a neighborhood Gem. The menu is full of wonderfully unique creations and the food is absolutely amazing. I just found out about this Resturant from the new Green Valley magazine that I received in the mail. 
We went there for lunch yesterday and breakfast today. Everything we ordered was Delicious!!!!!! I even like how some of the food is played on unique slate trays. Can't wait for them to move into their newly designed space. 
Can't get enough of this food."}
{"text":"Best food EVER! I ate the corned beef tacos  and my husband ate the pork banh mi sandwich and both tasted so amazing. The server also brought us cinnamon chips with banana Nutella...delicious! The chips were flaky and the Nutella had the perfect amount of sweetness. The staff was very nice also. The servers kept checking on us and even the chef came out. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm one of those lucky, unfortunates that didn't get the enjoyment from this restaurant like all the other Yelpers...

The service was decent... until it got busy.  The wait on food was horrendous. 

We got the berry French toast.  It was super delicious, but just DRENCHED in that berry syrup, which made it soggy from the get-go.

The Ono wings were my fave.  They had good flavors, just wish there were more sauce on them or on the side (waitress was too busy, so we couldn't ask for more sauce).

The burger with the mushrooms... do not get it. They were the greasiest burger ever.  My fiancé and I wanted to split the burger, I see what the chef was trying to do, he wanted to do us a favor and split it for us in the kitchen, but he didn't have to add more oil or grease or whatever it was then put it back on the grill insides down.  So when that happened, it dried out the meat and made everything else inedible. 

And they didn't have bottled water... the girl told me, \"our water is filtered though.\"  Ok, thanks... I'd hope so."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food here is done with a mixture of a lot of cultures and fusioned together in the most delicious way! I always try something new every time I go in there and I'm always happy with what I get! The people are very friendly there and the chef/owner always comes by and asks how the meal was and if everything was up to par!!! Can't get better service than that!!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a find! The service is exceptional and the food unexpected. We were brought complimentary chips and salsa (yum!) and then ordered from the breakfast (served all day) and lunch menu.

I had Matt's omelet with crispy potatoes. Delicious flavor. He had the BLAT - it was out of this world fantastic. Adding an order of sweet potato fries was perfect with the large portions. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Brunch is my favorite thing to do on the weekends. We came here based on yelp reviews eventhough when I looked it up the photos on yelp did not look that spectacular for me to be excited about visiting,at least in my own visual perspective. 

For a Sunday this place is empty. Okay it could be some factors but for a Sunday it's a bit odd for it to be just us (1 table) This is my first time to be \"the only table\" to be served, so I guess I expect to be served well, granted we are the only table. I can't complain about the service since it's only us.  It'll be weird if I have to wait 30 mins for a dish. We tried the grilled pork belly benedict and french toast. For the Pork Belly Benedict, it was just alright nothing that would want me to come back & try it again. The meat and fat ratio is more towards the pork fat and the potatoes are extremely dry, bland and cold. As for the French Toast I like the crunchiness but nothing epic. The presentation looks different from other yelp photos. I guess it depends on what fruit toppings they have available. I wasn't asked for any choices, they just came out with blueberries. Overall the food is just okay, like I said nothing that would want me to come back.

This is my first Sunday Brunch that I felt I didn't enjoy my whole brunch experience at all. I think the food is a bit over priced too. I don't mind spending my hard earned cash for good food but I also expect  a total good experience in trying out your restaurant. I really hope SERVE could thrive in the brunch scene.  The potential is there but just not today."}
{"text":"Dude, I'm still sitting in here amazed at what I just had. Was skeptical at first, never having been here before, let me tell you; when you see the chef come out with the huge sized burgers still sizzling, the whole room goes quiet with amazement. They have a great variety, and seem to nail everything they make! 

I had a Bahn Mi, and that pork just melted in my mouth, while my significant other had the most spectacular BLT (which comes with this amazing thick, caramelized bacon) 

Truly remarkable gem of a place. Should be a staple in your schedule if you want to treat yourself."}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time and it was fantastic.  The food not only looked amazing, but it was amazing.  I highly recommend going there for a great meal."}
{"text":"Great food here! Honestly Nothing bad to say, I definitely enjoyed the pork belly burger ... IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE I CANNOT FORGET!!"}
{"text":"If you want 2 dead ants in your ketchup, definitely come to this place. I'm disgusted and don't even want to think about how many bugs are in their kitchen."}
{"text":"WOW served impressed me when you first walk in it has a weird feel almost doesn't look like a restaurant. Most places don't have carpeting you can't see or here the kitchen even though it is only on the other side of the wall. 

Let's get to the food now most food seems to be slightly on the healthy side I ordered the Galbi tacos OMG!  so freaking good and check out the perfect size mini cheese cakes a nice addition to clean my taste buds. 

The service is just as good as the food wait staff is very helpful Served is located in the same center as Kitchen Table but on the other side of the center. GET HERE SOON"}
{"text":"I got served so hard. 

I hope there's still room on the 5-Star bandwagon for me to ride along. I mean, there aren't too many places in Vegas that have an excellent brunch service and Henderson is lucky enough to get two spots in the same parking lot. \"Served\" is in a low key part of Henderson, hidden from the main street in a space that looks like an old office for a medical practitioner, so needless to say this location could use some design love, but it definitely didn't take anything away from the food. 

The food, OMG. The food. I went the Miso Pork Belly Burger and that came with seasoned fried potato wedges. This was tough to eat just based pure size, but all of that jaw work totally paid off in full! The Pork Belly was so tender and melted with each bite, sometimes pork belly can be overly salted or chewy and that was not the case here. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium with just a hint of pink in the middle and still super juicy! The potato wedges were crispy outside and soft on the inside definitely fresh cut, seasoned and lightly fired. 

Every table comes with a housemaid chips and salsa, which was very fresh and a great snacking option to get the pallet ready for action. The service was super attentive and very fast; chef even came out at one point and asked about the meal. Great hospitality and service seems to becoming the way of the buffalo in this town, but the force is strong here at Served."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time just now through uber eats! Forgot to take pictures since I was starving from studying all morning but everything looked just as good as the other pictures I've seen here on their yelp. 

Short Rib Benedict $23: Braised short rib in chiles and spices with queso fresco, cilantro, hollandaise sauce, and 2 of the biggest poached eggs I've ever seen served on sourdough crostinis. This one was probably my favorite out of the 3 items we tried. The short rib had rich flavor like it had been slowly cooked for a long time and was basically melt in your mouth and the poached eggs were perfectly runny (which is amazing since they stayed intact through delivery). The sourdough was also super sour which I love! And if you're ordering through uber eats, they had the hollandaise and short rib au jus in separate containers so nothing got soggy! Also the potatoes we're soft and seasoned with a little spice, really flavorful. 

Apple Pie Tempura Pancakes $14: Diced apples sautéed in butter, brown sugar, cinnamon on top of fluffy pancakes with tempura apples. The description on uber eats said they also came with walnuts, whipped cream and powdered sugar but I didn't get any of those which I'm sad about but the pancakes were really light and the apples had good flavor, tasted come citrus in the apple compote as well. 

Miso Pork Belly Burger $17: 8 oz Angus beef patty topped with marinated roasted pork belly, arugula salad with miso vinagrette, tomato, pickles, wasabi mayo, melted provolone cheese on a brioche bun served with your choice of crispy potato nuggets, sweet potato fries or mac salad (I got the potato nuggets). This thing was massive! Oh my goodness. I could only taste a little bit of this guy after eating part of the benedict and pancakes but the flavor was awesome. The wasabi mayo gave it that needed spice that cut through the richness of the pork belly and cheese and the vinagrette also helped as well. I will say it was on the salty side, makes sense because of the miso and pork belly but the flavors were awesome. You got savory, spicy, salty, and creamy all in one! Crispy potato nuggets were also a nice twist instead of getting regular french fries. 

Overall, the quality of food was awesome especially for getting it delivery. Only took 40 minutes and I live 20 minutes away from them! Can't wait to actually try many more of their fusion dishes in person!"}
{"text":"Go Here NOW!
You just gotta try this place.
Small, tucked in a quiet business complex off of Horizon and Valle Verde really close to the cleaners.
I really hope they make it because it's Great.  :)

The Menu
Breakfast and Lunch only... open 9-5.  Breakfast is served ALL DAY.  WooHoo!  I'm a breakfast person so I love this.  Although, for my first trip I didn't have breakfast... next time.
Their menu isn't HUGE but they have a lot to choose from!  
I'm loving the fact that there is a Filipino sausage on the menu used in a breakfast dish as well as in tacos!  Yes.... tacos!  Oh Yea!
They have almost everything... from full sized \"entrees\" to sandwiches to salads to tacos to a baked mac n cheese \"of the day\".  So much to choose from.  Everything on the menu sounds D-lish!
The influence is American Comfort foods with a Flair of Asian in some dishes.
The prices are VERY reasonable for the quality of food and the size of the portions.  

The Food
My mom has been several times and she has loved EVERYTHING she's ordered to date.  
Today... we shared the Longanisa Tacos and the Asian BLAT.  
The tacos were piled high with sausage and an Asian slaw.  The crisp and slight vinegar from the slaw perfectly complemented the sweet savory Filipino sausage.  You get 3 of them in an order and while they look like street taco sized... they are filled to overflowing with yumminess!
The Asian BLAT had the most succulent pork belly I've tasted... MELT IN YOUR MOUTH. The avocado, arugula and tomatoes on the sandwich were fresh and all these flavors just melded so nicely that I could have kept eating if there was more.  It comes with a small side... I opted for the mac salad which is not your ordinary mayonnaise-drenched mac salad. Oh no... I don't know what the dressing was but it was not heavy and it was not salty.  

The Service
Friendly, quick, on top of it!
Jamie the hostess/server was friendly and quick to get our ice tea, and quickly refilled them (I was thirsty) several times.  They were never empty.  I love this!  She also didn't rush us nor did she hover while we were trying to decide what to get.  It was like she just knew when to come over. 
The chef (Matt) also came out to say Hi.  And since my mom is something of a regular now, he chatted with her about a couple dishes and stuff.  It was so nice!

I'm excited to go back to try their Baked Berry French Toast and their Portabello Bennie for breakfast and I really want to try their Bi Bim Bap as well as the Pork Belly Bahn Mi and all of the tacos.  :)

They do Take-Out so call ahead and swing by to pick up lunch or dinner.  I know I will.  :)"}
{"text":"Not sure what the negative review was all about but we really enjoyed this place.  Waitress and staff were very polite and food was Awesome.  If your looking for fast food quality don't go here.  If you want well prepared and excellent tasting food in a quiet soothing ambiance this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Came from Cali to NV. Had lunch at Served during their opening weekend. Really good, quaint, and cozy restaurant. Foods were amazingly delish! Shared the shrimp tempura po'boy and portobello veggie sandwiches with a side of sweet fries. Sandwiches were good portioned, with delightful presentation, flavorful, mouth watering taste goodness! Not your usual sandwich blend. A definite must try! Will be back again and again.."}
{"text":"Great service and food. The Benedict had perfectly poached eggs and a nice crispy bun. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Day after Christmas, there's no way I am eating turkey dinner left overs for breakfast so I hauled my family to Served. I've been wanting to try this restaurant for months now and I was not disappointed.  Our server was super nice and energetic.  My daughter and I ordered tocilog and longsilog, definitely a cultural dish on one of the islands in Southeast Asia.
The tocino meat tasted homemade, lightly sweet, seasoned perfectly but the meat was cut too thick.
It was hard to chew.  I was expecting a thinner slice of meat.  I got a bite of the longaniza (sausage), it was lean and tasted fresh, seasoned just right.
The server stated that they cure their meats and make sausages from scratch. They do taste fresh and homemade.
The dish came with this amazing garlicky pan fried rice, pickled papaya (only a spoonful, hoping for a decent size), 3 sunny side up fried eggs. They even have the exotic blend of white vinegar for dipping the meat.
Our other  guests ordered the Seoul Benny Benedict and it looked yummy, anything with Korean grilled short ribs is heavenly! the Huevos Rancheros breakfast looked like a hot mess (lol) on the plate with so many components on top of each other but  it tasted equally delicious accdg to my friend. I wish I had a bite to kinda' give you more of how the flavors came together. 
The Benedict's menu is a must. It's definitely a fusion of flavors and this restaurant offers an eclectic menu that keeps you wanting to go back for more and try some interesting  dishes. 
A great place for breakfast!  
This is a minimalist, casual dining joint.
The chef comes out and takes his time to greet all his diners...impressive!"}
{"text":"the food i had today was just ok. I liked the taste of my food and the way it made me feel as though i was in peru. But i felt that the portion size was too much and somehow overwhelming in flavor. But i also felt that my service was just ok. I love that the chef came out to see how it was, but the waitress who is new (i'll give her that) added on things we didnt ask for (which she did fix i appreciated) but she just gave my friend sweet potatoes without asking her what she wanted as a side, and her burger was practically raw. I think its a great concept nice place but they need to clean a few things up... oh and my water had black things floating in it twice even after i asked for a new one."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Went in this morning for brunch. 

Specials: Short Rib Benedict - delicious! Short rib, cooked to perfection. Potatoes were also tasty and yummy.

Filipino Breakfast - tasted like how we grew up with. 

Ono Wings & Rice - fried chicken wings with a sweet soy based sauce. Rice was a little hard than what we are use to, but we were still satisfied.

Toast with homemade strawberry jam - bread was toasted perfectly and that butter and jam was delicious! I'm craving it still! 

Overall yummy! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! The food was unsurpassed! OMG! I'm in love! We had the apple pancakes and juevos rancheros and they were insanely good! It was look good porn! The presentation and the taste, the flavors were impeccable! Very neat very clean and friendly! It's a must!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Super flavorful and they have good quality coffee. Friendly staff and service was great. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely a must try in Henderson for breakfast, everything I ordered was flavorful, tender, well portioned, and best yet well prepared. The Benedict de buco was AMAZING and the pork belly was cooked to perfection! Service was great, make sure to ask for Mike, very relaxed and professional. It's always such a nice touch to have the chef and multiple staff check on your experience. Absolutely will be back VERY soon!"}
{"text":"Good service because servers are always right now top of your table due to the cramp space but good service none the less. Paid just under $60 for two people at breakfast. Based on the quality of the food would have gladly paid $18 before tip but not a penny more.  If you are bored and have no reguard for money and or food quality Served is a very viable option."}
{"text":"Just had an interesting experience at this place. Our large group was greeted by a waiter who came to the end of our male dominated table and announced the bottomless mimosas that they offer on the weekends. Then, he turns and looks at me and says, \"unfortunately this lady can't participate. But, she can sit back and observe you gentlemen enjoy.\" I have no idea why he said this?! I wasn't planning on ordering one, but was appalled at this comment. We have a large party half of which are 13 year old boys. Is he assuming that since I'm \"the mom\" I have to take care of everyone? I was also holding my four month old baby when he said this. So, new moms can't enjoy mimosas? And, how dId he even know it was my baby or my kids? I just feel like a lot of very sexist assumptions were made very quickly. This guy was out of line. 

The food was actually great!  Interesting combinations of flavor and huge portions. The chef even took the time to come out to check on our food, which meant a lot since they were super busy. If not for the asshole server, who should be fired, this would definitely get five stars."}
{"text":"This place is good. We went for lunch one day and it was extremely hot inside the building it almost felt as if the air conditioning wasn't working. The food was alright I was expecting there to be more flavor. The staff was all really polite. All in all it was a good experience but not a great experience."}
{"text":"Wow.. was looking for something other than the tradition diner breakfast.. and so happy I stumbled upon served. The Filipino breakfast was amazing,  very fresh and the pork belly was outstanding.. no crazy spices or herbs just fresh flavors. Highly recommend for your non traditional breakfast!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and came across this place on yelp. Despite all the reviews I figured we can give it a try. The place is very hidden, so you really need to actively look for it. It is a very small hole in the wall place with probably about 12 tables. We got seated fast however, sat at the table for over 15-20 minutes before someone came over to get us drinks. Workers just kept passing the table and seemed they had no idea what was going on. After we got our drinks we were told a server will be by to take our food order. Add on another 15 minutes before someone came back. The menu has very interesting options. The food was the best part of our experience. The food was delicious and very tasty. The presentation also was appealing to the eyes. Overall the customer service was horrible. Not once did they offer a water refill. A server never checked in on us.  This place has potential if they can get the team on board."}
{"text":"Outstanding food & excellent service! My husband, daughters & I enjoyed it! Very cute ambiance and the staff is remarkable, always checking if we need anything. And the chef would come out after the food is served just to check it was made to your liking! Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We thought we would try this place since the Kitchen Table down the street had an hour wait. 
Service was good but food was just okay. 
Ordered corn beef hash and eggs since the server said anything with corn beef was excellent. Was pretty disappointed as the corn beef was pretty dry and stringy. 
Hubby had breakfast sandwich with one egg over medium which came out over hard. Bacon was so sweet he couldn't eat it. 
Kiddo had pancakes which were very good. 

Would recommend passing on this one."}
{"text":"A great little place with wonderful food at reasonable prices, and friendly young staff that even folks living in the neighborhood might not have heard about. When you go and like it.. tell all your friends and family!"}
{"text":"Every time I've came to this restaurant I've tried something new and I've never been disappointed with the food or service. The food is unique in taste and offer a pleasing palate of flavors."}
{"text":"Went to this place randomly and it ended up being awesome! Big portions, tasty and unique. The cheese sauce was delicious and the people there were super nice. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Been there twice and both times were amazing. Try the BBQ Burger or the beef enchiladas, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch many times. Never disappointed. Always great food , drinks and friendly staff. I highly recommend this place if you live in Henderson"}
{"text":"Glad I  found this place! Food was delicious and presentation was on point. The head chef came out to say hi, which I thought was pretty cool.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Me and the lady ordered the spam and eggs, and the berry crispy french toast.   It was the most flavorful spam and eggs dish I've ever tasted.  The crispy french toast was just perfect.  
I would recommend coming here, the service is great and the food will speak for itself."}
{"text":"Sooooo... 6 months later and was a completely pleasant experience, the customer service was excellent & Chef Matt did not disappoint!   
Would recommend Served to anyone, especially friends visiting from out of town, the overall experience represents Vegas well!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing and so was the service. The chef came out to check if we were enjoying our meal. We loved it. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here on my birthday 10/12/17 and I was not disappointed. There was only one server , but let me tell you , he did it all and with a smile on his face. I forgot his name but he was so awesome, he was the host , the busser, the server, he was so sweet and just a lovely person. He made my birthday even better.
I tried the portobello Benedict and that had to have been the best tasting mushroom I have ever had in my life. It was roasted to perfection as were the other vegetables. It takes a lot to impress someone with some simple veggies but chef did that and more. 
My other half had the bacon tempura pancakes and he loved them. The visual for both of these dishes was splendorous. We have been talking about getting takeout from there for a while , but the dine in experience was worth it. The chef came over and greeted the guests , which was icing on the cake. 
They officially have a repeat customer

Shout out to the gentleman doing it all and the chef!!"}
{"text":"We were looking to try someplace new and found this American-Asian fusion restaurant. It's tucked away in a business park, but don't let that deter you from coming. This place is absolutely amazing. You need to try the longanisa fried rice. The bits of pork has hint of some sweetness and tanginess, so good. The nurse came with shallots that are delicious. The place has excellent ambience."}
{"text":"Great little resturant nestled in the corner of an unassuming office complex!

The food here is Korean fusion brunch! How awesome is that?

We got the Bibimbap and the Korean short rib benny. Wow both was packed with flavor and that savory spicy taste that I can't get enough of.

The only draw back was the portions was on the slightly smaller side. Next time I will have to order two things, but of course I'm a big eater.

I will definitely be back to give them another go soon."}
{"text":"Seems like one staff person was doing the work of three.  Food selection not so great.  We ordered drinks and 5 minutes later the wait staff informed us that she was \"just about to\" bring the drinks out.  There were only 2 customers there.  We ended up leaving."}
{"text":"I personally thought it was great! The one I was with thought it was just okay lol. But oh well. 

We came in like mothaeffin tourists on a Monday morning because Served showed up as one of the best foodie restaurants in LV. 

The service was fantastic. Our server made us feel right at home and she was warm and kind to us all throughout. She's also got honestly the most personality I've seen in a server in a long and hot minute. 

We ordered the Truffle Mushroom
burger and the Korean BBQ plate. The food, as massive as it was, was kind of a let down. I think it may not have been seasoned or flavorful enough and there was a lack of sauce on both plates. 

We would love to come back but...we live in LA. But we'll keep it in mind!"}
{"text":"We met for a family breakfast here this morning and honestly everything we ordered was fantastic. The smaller space made it feel more like home than eating out and the service was absolutely wonderful. This may be our new Sunday brunch place. Accommodating our family of 11 is mo easy task, but they did it and we loved the food and the experience."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Happened in here...heard it yelped well. Pleasantly surprised...delicious food, beautifully served. The chefs came to check how the food was. Definitely a gourmet and innovative flair with interesting blends of flavors and high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to grab lunch, but had a taste for breakfast. Quick Yelp search yielded Served. 

Served is a breakfast & lunch only. I tend to be drawn to these types of places since they only have two meals which leads to a small menu to focus on.

I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and 1 pancake. The Corned Beef Hash was outstanding and likely the best I have ever had. The pancake was excellent. It had the light crispy texture that comes with cooking with lard. I think there is some serious cooking going here."}
{"text":"Hidden gem up by MacDonald Highlands. My wife and I ordered the Scotch Egg and the Pork Belly Banh Mi and both were some of the best dishes I've ever had.  The menu had more dishes I was looking forward to try when I come back.  The service was excellent and even the chef came out to greet guests and check on their meals.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with very friendly and accommodating staff.

For some reason we waited 5 months between having brunch and our first dinner experience. Now I wish I had those 5 months back just so i could have eaten at Served more often.
I say this with four dinners under my belt all of which have exceeded expectations. When you are first greeted by the menu it might be intimidating for someone who hasn't enjoyed asian influenced food before, but every dish I have had from the entree section has been the perfect blend of cultures. If you haven't had it yet just try the Pupusa. It is a perfect blend of well seasoned meat, cheese and thick corn tortillas. The other dish I would say not to pass up is appetizer chicken wings. There are enough to be an entire meal with great flavor to accompany. 

Most importantly is that on multiple visits chef Matt has come to check on his work which simply adds a wonderful touch to a restaurant that he undoubtedly cares greatly about.

I would recommend Served to anyone who wants great food and great service from a neighborhood location. Don't forget that they can also do take out or delivery!"}
{"text":"Just an awesome meal.  Fusion to the max.  Burgers, sandwiches, brunch/breakfast dishes - all with the American/Korean flare you had hoped for.  I recommend anything pork belly but you can't go wrong with a sandwich or burger.  I came on a weekday and breakfast options were still offered, so I'm not positive what changes for weekend/brunch offerings, but I'm intrigued and would definitely come back to test it out.

I had the I had the Asian BLTA with pork belly and an egg.  Huge sandwich on Texas toast.  Honestly, impossible to eat, but forking and knifing it didn't take away from any of the flavor.  Sriracha it up and you're good to go.  I asked for spicy and it had no heat whatsoever, but it was still perfectly cooked and crispy.  Sweet potato fries were a little salty/underwhelming, but I do like a sandwich that comes with a side complimentary so I can't complain on that.

At Served you receive a full meal so expect to pay about $15 per person at least.  You will be full and content and surprised by the uniqueness and the beautiful presentation of the food.  You will feel taken care of by the staff.  As a restaurant, I also really like the cheap alcohol Happy Hour menu beginning at 2:00pm and the free Wi-Fi.  Give Served a chance for sure if you ever venture to this part of Henderson."}
{"text":"visited during happy hour and was able to order a few breakfast menu items, so we tried the soft shell crab benedict, green eggs/spam, pineapple fried rice, crispy pork belly tacos, kimchee kalbi fries, and all the happy hour sliders. we especially liked the flavors in the pineapple fried rice and the crispy pork belly tacos. i really liked the whole strip of bacon in the soju blue bloody mary. the food is on the heavier side so i would definitely come here ready to eat! its delicious and well worth the value!"}
{"text":"Just left Served. Start off with the waiter Manny is really nice and knowledgeable of the menu and gave me some good recommendations. I decided to go with the Pork Belly Benedict and it was delicious with a little bit of spice and the plate was beautiful. For dessert I had the berry bread pudding and it was very bland, it needed some sugar or salt maybe. They will improve it. But i was very happy with my entree and service."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. I do. Although there are some great ideas here, the execution doesn't do it for me. 

Someone's a bit heavy handed with the msg here. Had the Soft Shell Crab Tempura Benedict.. yikes. The MSG. THE MSG. don't lie to me and tell me you don't use it. I'm Filipino, I'm familiar with the after effects it leaves in your mouth. Then I don't know if it's the grease they cooked the potatoes in, or the over use of salt.. but yuck! I spit out the potatoes. 

Spam & Eggs, eh. It's spam. I like spam, but the dish.. is it worth the amount they're charging it for? No. Again, it's Spam. The Thai butter is a nice touch on the eggs though. 

The Chicken wings? Nice taste. Again, worth the price? Probably not. $7 maximum, easily at a local Hawaiian or Korean spot. 

Biggest disappointment would probably be the soft shell crab tempura. I heard such great things, and was let down. Would I visit again? Maybe. Maybe not. Wasn't exciting. Inflated pricing that was just \"Eh\" food. Couldn't justify it."}
{"text":"Chef Matt is amazing! Not only is the food amazing but the chef is down to earth and humble. Nice man who cares about his customers and wants to make sure you enjoyed every bite. I've never seen a chef come out to greet his customers and even fill up drinks. The whole staff had amazing service. We will be back."}
{"text":"I went here today with my sisters... upon entering we were greeted and seated, both the hostess and server were very nice... the server got us all situated, took our drink orders and left us all alone to look over the menu. When she returned with water in to-go cups, she took our orders (by memory, didn't right anything down). Our food came out shortly after and sure enough somethings were not right. My eggs were more over-medium then they were over-hard, which is what I asked for... I didn't get the side of avocado I asked for and our drinks never came, NEVER CAME... the food isn't all that great but i guess its tolerable if your hungry... do yourself a favor, stay home and have breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal, a fusion of culinary creativity in a cozy, intimate environment. The chef/owner Matthew Meyer, was humble and gracious enough to take the time and personally check on the entrees and how our experience was. This is a man that takes his work and passion seriously, which, in a city overwhelmed with service options makes all the difference. Sorry for the half-eaten entrées, the food smelled too good to wait. If you're coming for brunch, you NEED to request Troi, he's the only one in this town that understands the true meaning of bottomless mimosas, and made a perfect suggestion for my and my girlfriend's plates as this was our first in a series of return visits."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast spot. I've never had longanisa anywhere besides a traditional Philippino restaurant. It was so delicious! Not sure what brand the coffee was, but it was so much better than you usually find at resturants. Cinnamon sugar chips while you wait were such a nice surprise. The chef checked on us which is so nice to get personal service. The waitress was very attentive and nice. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance and I'm definitely glad I did. Food is amazing, service is amazing and the chef/owner comes by to make sure you enjoyed your meal. Give it a go you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully creative American AND ethnic cuisine.  Breakfast food, sandwiches and creative main courses.  A mix of korean Benedict's, phillipino fusion, so very interesting and tasty.  Matt, the chef/owner, personally comes out and checks on you.  Manny gleefully refills your bottomlessness guava mimosas!  A serious find in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I don't normally post reviews, but I had to help spread the word about this fantastic restaurant! We were a party of 4 and everyone devoured their plates! The berry French toast was incredible along with huevos rancheros - the green salsa was amazing! The personal touch is what put this place above all others! Ordered my dish w/out beans and the chef brought me some on the side, personally, suggesting I try a bite. He wasn't pushy, just passionate about his dish! He was right...they were great! Also had the papusa on suggestion and that was a dish of incredible flavor and different from anything else I've ever had. This place is a must try!  Ask for Joe the server!"}
{"text":"My best friend is in town and I wanted to take her to my favorite brunch spot, which *was* The Kitchen Table. However, the wait was too long for how hungry we were, so when we looked for other options we discovered there was another brunch spot in the same parking lot: Served. So we figured we would give it a try. It's difficult to even know where to begin to review our excellent experience. The service was stellar, the menu was unique and offered something for everyone, and they offer complementary cinnamon chips and Nutella dip to start you off! Delicious. The food was spectacular, inspired, and presented beautifully. I was given the wrong order by mistake and the speed with which the mistake was remedied was unreal. I ordered the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict and it most definitely lived up to the hype. The prices are a tad higher than what I would normally go for, but it was definitely worth it. 10/10 would go back again, as I now have TWO favorite brunch spots!"}
{"text":"Last minute to the airport and found this hole in the wall.   It is eye rolling good!!!  I am extremely impress with the Miso Pork Belly Burger and the truffle nuggets.  The location and deco isn't the best, however we are here for the taste and they well deserve 5 stars!   

The patty, pork belly, sauce are well balanced!  Along with the truffle nuggets.  Yum yum!   If you are in Vegas.  Must try!  :)"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place with interesting menu. You can try filipino and traditional American dishes. Good atmosphere but strange music and service is just okay. Pancakes were delicious! Bacon wasn't my thing."}
{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast/brunch spot. Lots to choose from on the menu. I had the short rib benedict and my man had the longsilog. Love the fusion they've incorporated into their dishes. My short rib fell off the bone... it was THAT tender. Everything is made fresh, very flavorful and the presentation is impressive. Customer service is great - the waiter was very attentive. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for the second time today and was just as impressed with today as I was with my first visit. The food is just beautiful and really delicious. Today, we ordered papusas and a pork belly benedict. Both were awesome but the winner was the papusas.

I would definitely return just based on food but have to add that both times I've been in, service has been excellent. There are a few fun looking menu options I need to explore and we will be back :)"}
{"text":"Served ? More like waited forever to get served. 

This place has great food. I compliment the chef 100% .. 

Sadly the service is what gives this place such a low rating, from me at least. Our Server, tall gentleman, had no personality. He wouldn't smile nor did he greet us upon arrival. I'm very observant of my surroundings when I go anywhere, and one thing I did notice was how unfriendly he was towards our table. I noticed him greet everyone else and laugh with certain customers, but he obviously didn't seem to want to extend the same courtesy towards us. Aside from the lack of customer service, our glasses of water, were just that. Glasses of empty water decorating the table. They were rarely filled. Mind you the restaurant was not packed, mayber one or two tables besides ours. At one point my friend asked for a refill and they only refilled the cup half way. Laughable. 

Food took forever, waited about 1.5hrs .. At this point more customers had arrived and were fed and on their way long after we arrived, but way before we received our meals ( 4 tables total - I kept track ) .. but we forgive the chef, because like I said, the food was pretty good and he graciously came out to greet and ensure we had received all our entrees and to ask if everything was okay with our meals. 

I've worked in the customer service industry .. food/hotel/retail .. for years and I pride myself in ensuring that whomever I am assisting in that moment, that when they leave me, they've left satisfied. ( I've dealt with pain in the ass idiot customers ) but even I've always kept my game face on. And we were far from the closest pain in the ass anything. 

I've never left a table without showing my gratitude. Sadly this time I did. 

But once more, food was very tasty. The chef knows his stuff (try the tacos, langosina burger and the ono wings) .. and hey maybe our server might like your table, who knows, but for now and probably ever (because I won't be bringing my business back to this establishment) my rating sticks."}
{"text":"Too many strikes on this one - NEVER going back now!  We came here several times from Oct-Dec - at least 5-6 and really enjoyed the food and experience.  We finally discovered that Served offers a military/veteran's discount of 50% their meal!  Wow - amazing!  So, we show up for a family meal (with 4 veterans/military, 2 other adults and 2 children) and our served says that since there are so many of us we are simply going to get a 20% discount for the table - talk about a bait and switch...not a happy customer...  However, we really loved their food so after a few months we felt like it was time to give them another chance... So that was today for our family of four.  We showed up and were told it would be about a 25 minute wait - not bad and worth it.  After about 45 minutes we are told the next table is ours - longer wait then expected but still time to give them another shot... So we walk in to be seated when the next table opens up, we were then informed that people with a reservation just showed up so now that table is theirs, but the NEXT one will be ours...SERIOUSLY!!!!  We just wasted almost of an hour of our day for no food!  Suffice to say - we left so as not to waste any more time in our day.  We will definitely NEVER be returning now.  This is not how any business should operate!"}
{"text":"We just got Served. Amazing spot, lots of variety and fusion of foods. Everything was prepped well. The bacon was amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Not your typical menu with lots of interesting choices. The service is great, and if the chef/owner is not swamped he comes to your table to ask about the food. I have never been disappointed. It's a great find."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews, my friend and I decided to eat Saturday brunch.  Perhaps it was because we highly anticipated the friendly customer service and unforgettable food that others on Yelp described, we were so deeply disappointed.  It was hard to find though we have lived in the area over 15 years.  Tucked away in a multiple strip mall, the signage and exterior are minimal and the interior was bland.  The long narrow room with beige walls reminded me of a place you go to get blood tests. 
 
There was only one other customer  who left after looking at the menu. The waitress, Amanda was very nice and helped us understand the menu.  She said it was the last day for that menu, it was being completely changed the next day.  This should have warned us, but we laughingly asked for items that were going to be carried over to the new menu thinking we would get the best.  WRONG.

 We ordered The Wellington burger and pork belly Bernaise.  Despite the lack of customers it took a long time for the food to get to the table.  My friends burger was medium, not medium rare, and the sweet potatoe fries were dried out and over salted. I did not taste the Bernaise on my eggs, because the pork belly pieces (laying on the side of a hot stone which served as a plate) were shriveled and not even hot to the touch. And the tater tots were burned. Amanda apologized and took it away. Since we had not been served at the same time, I had a bite of my friends burger and decided to order one as a replacement. Amanda came back to the table to tell us the fryer was broken now and Fries were not available. She then said the chef would make us a complimentary dessert.  When I bit into the burger it was very well done, though I ordered medium rare. I couldn't eat it either.  At this point the Chef came to the table and dropped a creme brûlée plate on the table saying \"here is the dessert YOU requested\".  We had not! Small blueberries and 1/2 of a strawberry was on one section of the top and the rest covered in whipped cream.* He immediately began telling us we should not have complained, that even though he didn't eat this kind of food.  ( He said he ate \"clean\"), customers raved about the dishes we ordered.  He was clearly angry and not interested in hearing our opinions.  In fact, he said it was our opinion not the general consensus.  After 5 minutes of bickering, he left and Amanda brought us the bill minus the cost of my burger.  We left a 40% tip for the waitress but regretted the gesture because the chef would get the wrong idea.  So, this is the reason for this review. We want to spare anyone else that is looking to have a meal were their tastes are of concern...and frankly where the chef is proud enough to eat the food he cooks. Overcooks!

*After Chef left,  we found why...the top was not carmelized..it was black (burnt) and disguised by the fruit and whipped cream.  Shame on him!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good place.
I've never tried Filipino breakfast till than. Very good twist (fusion) between American and Filipino traditional food. 
Definitely recommended. I wish I lived closer so I could try other items on their menu.
But I will be back as soon as I get a chance to travel to Nevada again."}
{"text":"Great service and Great food! The best experience Ive had in a long time! Im definitely going back. The chef came out to ensure we were enjoying our food! Highly recommend the miso pork belly burger with sweet potato fries! #ToDieFor"}
{"text":"Delightful and Delicious. Great staff (thank you Miss Linda for making me feel welcome & suggesting a good wine with my meal)
Matt (owner/chef) comes out and greets his patrons and ask how his meals turned out for his guest . Who does that any more? Very personable, food was really, really good. A lot of flavor and color . I'm going back."}
{"text":"If I based this solely on food I would give this place 5 stars. 

The service is lacking here. When we walked in we were stared down by other guest and nobody to greet us right away. After waiting we were sat but the attitude of the server was just not pleasant. Super nonchalant and you could tell he didn't want to be there. I don't know about you guys but that definitely throws me off and puts a bad taste in my mouth before the food even gets there. He didn't make any comments about the menu, didn't ask if we've been in before, didn't take our drink order (another server did), didn't make any suggestions. All he said when we were ready was \"what can I get you?\" Blah.

Anyway, the dishes we got were beautifully plated and delicious! We got the Peruvian lomo saltado and the green eggs and spam. We shared an order or the sweet potato fries. I appreciate the fact that my dish came with a side of vinegar as a dipping sauce lol. I couldn't finish my food but everything was so good. The sweet potato fries were in a tempura batter or something, but they probably made it to my top 5 fries lol. The prices are definitely a little high but I'm guessing it's because the quality of food. I definitely want to come back to give the other items a try."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent food. Good service. I love seeing the owner/chef front of house. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with some friends and I was surprised that they recently started serving dinner since they usually just do breakfast, brunch, and lunch. I guess I got lucky that time lol. It was kinda empty when I went, but at least that meant we were able to order quickly.

I ordered the salmon togarashi which was pretty good in terms of taste and visual aesthetics. The skin was crispy (very important for me) and the fish was cooked very well. If i had one thing about the dish that was iffy, it would be the hollandaise sauce. Keep in mind that I generally don't like creamy, saucy things, so I am biased. The sauce just felt kind of out of place for the dish and I think it would have been better if they used a different sauce (but I guess they were trying to incorporate some brunch aspect to the dish). I also think this is the first dish I ever had with flower petals (unless it was something else lol). The veggies and mashed potato thing were delicious! I wish they gave me more, but this is a more classy, upscale place so I definitely understand the smaller portion. My friends ordered the salmon curry dish (their only complaint was that it was a little too spicy, but I didn't try it) and the miso pork belly burger (which looked delicious and it was pretty huge).

The overall experience was decent, but I wasn't really blown away. I might consider going here to check out their other items for brunch or something."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my husband for a quick bite. This menu is very interesting. My poached eggs were perfect. The service was excellent, and some of the best coffee I've ever had at a restaurant. Good job!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Served...quite frankly, I am not a huge fan.  We tried the soft shell crab Benedict (bleh...there wasn't alot of flavor profile here.  One bite was good, but then it was monotonous  throughout).  We also tried the miso pork belly burger.  I remembered I liked this better than the Benedict. But again, not very memorable.  I do remember that Debbie's selection, the scotch egg was unique and tasty.  We also got the fresh juice of the day.  I don't remember what it is, but I do remember that it was bland.

Will I give this place another try?  Have not yet decide..."}
{"text":"We found out about this place and decided to check it out since we live 5 mins away from it ! The staff were very welcoming and the food was AMAZING ! It's probably the best breakfast place I've ever had. Better than 5 star hotel breakfasts that I've tried ! Will be coming back here very soon :)

My new go-to breakfast place !!"}
{"text":"What an incredible find! The food is amazing and staff is really nice. You have to try the crispy rice with avocado, delicious. The green eggs and spam were great. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Outrageously delicious, hot turkey sammich with jus, horsey sauce, and provolone was best I've had in memory. Wife's breakfast sammy had candied? pepper bacon and the best hashbrowns in the city. Can't wait to go back and try everything else!!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came up from Kingman, AZ for a work event and we decided to try something new. We came in and our waiter, Manny, instantly sat us and got our drinks. His personality is unique and I appreciated that he called us by our first names the entire time. The wait on the food was minimal and the presentation was impressive to say the least. This was a perfect option for those times when everyone wants something different. The cook/owner Matthew came out to introduce himself and got to know our names as well. Overall, this is a great new restaurant and we definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!  My friend ordered the shrimp tempura  po'boy and I got the corned beef Benedict which comes on an amazing rye bread pudding. Everything is excellent!  It was more than I'd normally spend on breakfast but i ended up taking half home so It sort of worked out.  I'd prefer an option for a smaller portion at a smaller price. I'm not a light eater but the bread pudding was just too dense! The only thing keeping this place from being a five star review is the price point and the out of the way location. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Just took my cousins from out of town to eat here for brunch on Sunday and I can't remember the last time I've been wowed like that. We ordered the blueberry pancakes as a starter and they were amazing. The girls then ordered Juevos Rancheros and they were fantastic with an authentic longonisa sausage that was both savory and sweet. I ordered the pork belly Benedict that came with some fantastic Asian spices and a sweet chili sauce. It was honestly the best pork belly I can remember. My cousin ordered the corn beef hash and I was delighted at it's complex almost holiday spiced flavor profile. Everything we ordered was spectacular and we can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"A nice small breakfast spot located across from Siems eye center and Dr. Tran's office.
I'm not familiar with this area, so it was difficult for me to find this place.
Came here for late breakfast.
The waitress (blond lady) was very nice and cheerful. She suggested me to get roasted pork belly benedict. Korean boiled eggs caught my eye so I decided to try that also. She said Dr. Tran always order Korean boiled eggs when he's here and it's delicious. My food came out in 25 to 30 min but it was nice that they give complementary chips and salsa. 

Roasted pork belly benidict... Delicious! Poached eggs were perfectly made. Roasted pork belly was exactly like \"Char siu\" you would get in some Ramen shop. Very fatty and melt in your mouths. I was expecting to get muffin type bread but the bread was like french baguette toasted very hard. I couldn't cut with the knife so I had to pick it up with my fingers and ate it. 

Korean boiled eggs... When I saw \"Korean eggs\" on the menu, I thought of \"Korean sauna eggs\" which you would get in Korean spas (they roast eggs in hot sauna for hours) but completely different thing came out. It was exactly like \"Nitamago\" or \"Ajitama\" you would get in any nicer Ramen shop. Perfectly done sweet soy sauce flavored Nitamago. I loved it!

It was nice for the chef to come out and talk to every customer that was there. He was a very nice person. He explained me how to make perfect Nitamago (well, Korean boiled eggs) with vinegar and stuff. I don't know if he's a owner chef or head chef but I hope this place gets a lot of business!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Monday morning and the place was empty. My husband ordered the berry French toast and it was delicious! I ordered the portobello Benedict--it was just okay. I was disappointed at the lack of portobello mushrooms, there were only a couple for the whole plate. The presentation for both dishes was beautiful, but my breakfast was just a little lacking. For the price, I think we would rather go to Kitchen Table."}
{"text":"Becoming one of my favorites!  The service is great, and the Chef comes out to meet you personally.  My family and I eat here at least once a week and maybe more.  My favorite is the Korean BBQ plate and Panang Salmon.  Small little hole in the wall restaurant, maybe hidden, but very much worth finding.  This food here is top notch, off the hook, awesome."}
{"text":"On the hunt for a brunch spot I remembered seeing Served on my IG page from some followers. Served sits behind some other businesses off Horizon Ridge so you may not see it from the road.
They offer ordinary breakfast items and some items that your not going to find anywhere else. I had the crispy pork belly tacos. they were savory and sweet with the sugar cane vinegar slaw and pickled papaya. Pork wasn't very crispy but still  full of flavor. Served with a side of beans and Thai fried rice. 
the other dish I had was the Bi Bim Ba. marinated flank steak, different vegetables that have a kimchee taste with a poached egg and rice topped with hot sauce. A dish I was uncertain about was glad it was something I ordered. Meat was very tender and melted in your mouth and the hot sauce/kimchee combination was perfect with the poached egg on top. 
With so many options this is a place that will keep you coming back to try their different creations."}
{"text":"The food was beyond expected in the bet way possible. Lots of love and knowledge of Filipino cuisine was put in. Granted, I only ordered a breakfast item which was the longsilog, it still very much reminded me of a traditional homemade meal in a more gourmet presentation. Thank you for a delightful meal and service!"}
{"text":"Will def be back. Interesting menu with bold flavors, lots of options and great service. Will be back fo sho"}
{"text":"Great service! The menu choices made it very hard to pick just one thing!  The longanisa was delicious and it was a nice touch that the chef came around personally to ask how everything went."}
{"text":"12 of us came in today. The server was great to serve us. The food was absolutely amazing. All 12 of us ate every bite and the chef even comes to your table to check on how your service was. Highly recommended. Stellar service."}
{"text":"Great food... The fusion of flavors, and made from scratch entrees are remarkable. Not to mention their occasional specialty menu the Chef Matt puts together is off the chart, especially his scotch egg encased in longanisa...delicious... soft shell crab Benedict... beef hash Benedict with home made bread pudding... Ect.... you need to try everything."}
{"text":"Just left this place. 
It was delicious. I had the pupusas with eggs and meat and plantains........ It's was truly amazing. The chef nailed it. Will definitely be going back and will bring my friends. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"There is amazing, beyond belief and just OMG, served exceeded all of these. We were the first two guests of the morning and had come for breakfast. What we didn't know, is that our meal would be gourmet presentations and a collection of fresh flavors that just melted in your mouth. The Apple pie pancakes could fill 3 adults, the berry French toast was amazing covered in and around with enough healthy naturally sweet berries to give a weeks worth of antioxidants. The staff were professional polite and genuinely wonderful."}
{"text":"No surprise, this place never ceases to amaze me. The detail in preparation & quality of food is simply outstanding. It's been almost a year since I've been back but I'm glad I did. I always find my self savoring every bite. Thanks to our waiter Troy! Very friendly staff and awesome service. This place simply can't be beat and I will continue to recommend this place to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"I love Korean food, and I love this place since it's a marriage of American and Korean cuisine. The establishment itself is on the smaller side and it was pretty packed when I came on the weekend, so be prepared to wait a little if you come at a busy time. 

The wait is definitely worth it, since the food here is packed with flavor, and the service is super quick. I got the Korean Spicy Pork Bulgogi Benny, and it was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. The bulgogi was equally sweet and spicy and succulent and was topped on a mochi- like rice patty. I highly recommend it. My partner got the omelet, and loved it also. I loved the complimentary chips with salsa (the crisps was very well seasoned). 

I enjoyed everything here except for the the Kimchi Galbi Fries because they were overly sweet. The fries themselves were sweet (sweet potato fries), and they were topped with a saccharin white sauce and a kimchi sauce. I felt like I was eating sauce with a side of fries. This dish could work for others, just not for me. 

Served is a a millennial and foodie friendly joint that has unique fusion comfort food sure to please any taste. I'm looking forward to coming back here to try more."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. We had the berry French toast and the bam slam. Bacon was thick and flavorful, Pancakes fluffy but crisp on the outside, and the potatoes were crisp and seasoned. It's a smaller place, kinda dark, and pretty busy. Took a long time to checkout because of the lunch crowd filing in and the backup at the computer. But our waitress was kind and kept checking in. Oh, the chef also came out to check on the tables during our meal. I think that's cool and shows the pride he has in his place. We will be back and would recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Delicious GF options. The presentation was excellent- we could tell it was chef inspired restaurant. 

The coffee was right on point and I am a coffee snob. 

The service was personable but quirky -but in a good way. 

We would be back if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"Great find!!! Small place, but we were seated right away. The chef/owner comes out to check with each table after receiving their food, a great personal touch. The wait staff was friendly and awesome! When asking the waitress for a to-go cup for my hot coffee she kindly explained they don't have any hot go cups, but that she would gladly make me an iced coffee, which was so great! The portions are huge and we weren't complaining. Food is fantastic, you have to try this place! We will be back:)"}
{"text":"There isn't enough stars to justify this place. Let me just start by saying stuuupppppid fire   best breakfast I've had in Las Vegas   Staff was friendly  chef made sure everything was good   The bacon was so good   The soft shell crab Benedict was amazing"}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM worthy of multiple foodgasms.

I live in the northwest but had an errand near 215 & Easter so pulled my bookmarks and this was close so I stopped in.  It's tucked in the back of a small business center but not terribly hard to find.  Seating area is small but not tiny. Wait staff was friendly, helpful but didn't hover.

They serve breakfast and lunch.  I arrived at 11:30AM perused the menu only to find so many things I would love... but I stuck with what I went there to try.. Pork Belly Benedict.  Egg was perfectly cooked (amazing how many places can't poach an egg correctly!), sauce was flavorful, topped with microgreens, a little something spicy (jalepeno?) and all that on top of a few thick slices of pork belly on sourdough bread.  The flavors were spot on perfect.  Even the side of potatoes were perfectly crisp and hot.

It was so good I ordered the pork belly hogie to go with the intent of giving it to my neighbor.  Ssssh!  It never made it there.  The combination of pork with the pickled veggies was a perfect way to cut the fat... sort of like how Carolina pulled pork uses the apple cider vinegar.  Soft roll, some kind of sauce, a little heat but not much, pork belly, crunchy pickled veggies... once again the perfect combination of flavor.

The only thing I can say wasn't spot on isn't even worth deducting a star.  It's probably just a matter of personal preference.  I found the meatier part of the pork belly a little dry.  I think it's probably braise/roast vs some sort of BBQ or perhaps frozen vs fresh... but with everything perfectly seasoned and a great combinations of flavor, it's fairly minor.

The chef/owner came out to check.  Seemed nice, genuine and interested.  I had just finished eating and was basking the the afterglow of a foodgasm so I didn't really talk as much as I normally would.

The bottom line is I would drive the 25 miles again tomorrow to eat there again... and I might!  it's clear the chef has a great palate or at least compatible with mine!"}
{"text":"Great food n service .. very nice tiny place ... I love their decorations n the centerpiece on each tables .. will definitely come back"}
{"text":"With brunch being one of my favorite outings - I give this place high praise for not only their presentation, but the taste of their food.  The tempura apple pancakes were fantastic and are definitely a new favorite.  The serving sizes are generous and sharable - thumbs up all around.  We most definitely will be back again for those pancakes, as well as to try one of their many other appealing entrees."}
{"text":"This place is a laid back gem! With so many over-rated restaurants in LV it's really nice to find a spot with a young, talented chef mixing things up. (Instead of older famous chefs mailing it in). Chef Matt Meyer  is taking the best from various food cultures and putting his own spin on things. Kinda like Bruce Lee did with martial arts. 
Your meal starts with house made chips and salsa. Real good. From there feel free to explore the ever changing menu and discover your own favs!
  If your a fan of eggs benny then you'll love the hollandaise sauce. Fusian? Try east meets west meets south. This place has tons of interesting creations with a chef that empties his heart and soul into this establishment.  
 Do yourself a favor and check in here."}
{"text":"Good food.   Slightly upscale/casual dining.    Prices were a little higher than I expected,  but the quality and presentation of the food was good."}
{"text":"Philthy Reviews..... A Henderson restaurant featuring Filipino food that's better than some Filipino restaurants

Why go:  Because the menu offers up an amazing mix that deliver   Read on....

Tocilog: Basic Filipino breakfast raised to awesome heights.  Tocino, garlic fried rice, and egg.  Simple right? You'd be shocked how bad some places make this.  Not here.  Matt gets garlic rice like I haven't tasted for a while.  Tocino was just right in fatty goodness. 

Pork Belly burger:  see photo  this belly busting goodness is breakfast and lunch.  Henry said it was perfect but huge  He was just mad he couldn't fit it all in his mouth.  Juicy and sumptuous

Tempura battered bacon and pancakes:  I didn't mean to order this  I really just wanted the bacon but I don't think server understood me  I wasn't as clear as I could be  but no regrets.  It was amazingly baconey.  Pancakes had an amazing batter.  Bisquik batter it was not.  It was elevating. 

Ono plate: Chicken wings and spam and garlic rice(upgrade).  Perfect meal.  No chili for me though. 

I can't say enough about this spot other than eat here and I will be back when I'm in town next."}
{"text":"What a great little breakfast place! A hidden gem that's for sure! Everything is so fresh and tastes so good! If you are in the area it's a definitely go try, be careful though this place only has about 10 tables so space is very limited. But high recommendation to go try some breakfast food. The chef who is the owner came to the table and couldn't have been a nicer person too. And prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"This is a small, yet very chic restaurant. The decor is simple, but I liked it. Decor wise, I would suggest a 3rd curtain covering the opening near the back, it'll hide the boxes and other things patrons might not want to see. The restaurant is in a office park like location and is in the back off of horizon ridge

6 of us came in today for brunch, due to the small size of the restaurant we waited a few minutes for parties to leave so 2 tables could be put together. It looks like you can also make reservations. 

It started to get quite busy after we were seated, which led to a long wait to get drink orders in, then a long wait to get the food order in. The servers were doing their best to handle the crowd, but they just couldn't keep up. We ordered the food and then waited a very long time while munching on cinnamon chips with chocolate nutella dip - tasty but definitely not good for you!

Our party ordered the French toast (We wanted this as a appetizer, but it didn't work out that way) it was dense, crunchy, sweet, and pretty good. There were 8 thick pieces (about a 4th of a piece of white bread, but maybe 2.5 slices thick), covered in syrup, berries, and completely melted whipped cream. 

3 of us ordered corned beef hash bread pudding Benedict's  (2 of us got them, mine was given away to a different table), one pork belly Benedict, 2 of their version of grand slams. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, but thought the bread pudding on the hash was overcooked. I was able to try a bite, I loved the hash part. All people ordering Benedict's thought the poached eggs were overcooked. 

The grand slam people liked their very crispy bacon (some may say overcooked) and pancakes. Since I never received my food I polished off the French toast instead. The waitress apologized profusely for the oversight, she had the chef cook me up an order and I asked for it in a to go container - it'll make a nice dinner. She comped my meal and gave the table a 10% discount because half the table received their food about 10-15 minutes before the other half. It was a nice gesture, especially since the meals range from about 12 - 25 per plate. 

I appreciated the waitress very much, she was swamped so I don't blame her for the food incident or the fact that some drink glasses didn't get refilled. This is when you look at management and wonder why they can't staff properly for Sunday brunch when a good majority of people go out. 

I think this can be a good place, the chef might want to undercook a bit as I feel plates may be waiting under heat lamps, and they definitely go onto hot plates which continues to cook things. The waitress says weekdays are less busy, so if you're interested try at that time. 

Service 4/5 - they are busy and I could tell trying their best to keep up. 
Food 3/5 - beautiful presentation, just a bit overcooked which can give an off flavor, bread pudding was not well received 

Average 3.5 - but I'll give them a 4 for effort."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had the Salmon Panang Curry again. It is just the best Curry one could imagine. So delicious.  Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"There is a 15% off your entire bill coupon on yelp when you check in. Walking to the door we weren't sure if they was open or not. There wasn't many cars in the parking lot. When we got through the door, the waitress greeted us and walked us to our table. This restaurant is smaller and it holds about 48 people. But the way it is set up, it doesn't feel crowded which is nice. Chef Matt also came around to each table to check on how everything is tasting. 

The food is kind of like American Asian fusion. They have Asian dishes like filipino longanisa, garlic rice, pork belly, etc. For the American dishes they have pancakes, eggs Benedict, bacon, burgers, etc. 

$19: i ordered the miso pork belly burger with sweet potato fries. The burger is huge! You have to open your mouth wide to take a bite. The burger comes out medium rare. The pork belly melts in your mouth and the sweet potato fries are really good. 
$13: My little brother got the green eggs and spam. The spams are thick pieces. You can taste the garlic in the rice, without it being to overbearing. $18: My boyfriend ordered the Korean BBQ plate. It was ok. The plate was small compare to the price we paid. The prices are a little bit pricey. The burger was the best thing we ordered out of the three."}
{"text":"This is the second week I went back. I enjoyed it the first time and the second time was just as good. I tried both the french toast on the menu (one from last week and one for this week). I am actually craving for the banana french toast croissant.
I also had the meso pork bell burger and sweet potato fries. Food are of high quality and the flavors are amazing. The owner (head chef) checks on everyone to see if the food is good and to see if everything is ok. 
I live in Summerlin and will drive to Henderson for Served."}
{"text":"This place was so appealing to me even though the menu is very red meaty. I saw a few veggie and fish dishes that sounded amazing. Took a friend who was concerned that there was nothing she could eat but I'd already perused the menu on Yelp & knew there was. I had the Kabocha curry and it was spicy & full of veggie goodness. I even had leftovers the portion was generous. My dining mate had pineapple fried rice which was loaded with raisins and nuts and she loved it, too. Service was friendly and helpful since it was our first visit. Cassandra was energetic and handled several customers without missing a beat. The fresh watermelon drink was refreshing and perfect companion to the spicy awesome curry. I will bring my meat eating husband and friends here for sure and try other things like the Kimchi fried rice."}
{"text":"OMG this place is delicious! Went there for breakfast this morning with a couple of my girls. I had the smoked salmon benny- wild caught salmon (not nasty farmed!) smoked in house. It had the BEST delicious smoked flavor... SO good!! And the accompanying potatoes- sooo flavorful. To die for! They even brought us out some cinnamon chip things with nutella banana dip.. 
I can't wait to go back and try more dishes! A little hard to find (right across from Tran MD)  but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is lacking significantly. Although, the presentation of the dishes is absolutely beautiful, my entree was not very flavorful. I ordered the soft shell Benedict. I do have to say that their bacon is absolutely amazing. I will not be back, though."}
{"text":"It's only a matter of time before the wait for a table becomes the norm. This is the best food in the valley. Creative and innovative dishes. We started coming here 8  months ago and thank god the service has improved. Still some of the best food I have had in any part of the world. Location is a little awkward but that means you can get a parking spot easily. Don't miss this gem. I wish they would open one in my town Scottsdale.if I could rate 10 stars for food then I would."}
{"text":"OMG, I love this place! Tiny little restaurant, super cute. We got there at 5 p.m. and we were the only people there but several other people arrived shortly thereafter. They bring chips and salsa to the table and both items were outstanding. Fresh homemade salsa and if I had to guess the chips were probably made there also. I ordered the corned beef hash with egg. The waitress told me they quit serving that item at 2 p.m. however she would ask the chef if he would make it. So glad he said yes! Possibly the best corned beef hash I've ever had. My friend had the Miso Burger that came with sweet potato fries. Well, I couldn't help myself I ate all those sweet potato fries. Seasoned perfectly!! I am so keeping my fingers crossed that this tiny restaurant makes it here in Green Valley because the food was simply marvelous."}
{"text":"WHAT ARE THESE CINNAMON CHIPS EVERYONE SAYS THEY GOT?! I just had to get that out for a second.

So I came here around noon on a Saturday, although I'm a little disappointed I didn't get some cinnamon chips because they look tasty. Okay moving on..

So I have the huevos rancheros, but it was made with longanisa. Anyone not familiar will longanisa, it's a sweet sausage that's usually red and served for breakfast. It added a different taste and I'm a fan! Served definitely adds a twist to all of their food. 

That being said, some of their breakfast plates seem kind of basic for the prices so I would probably opt for one of their more interesting plates.

The service was very attentive. Our server always kept our water glasses filled. She was very friendly. I'm definitely a fan and will be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Holy Crap! This place just blew our minds this morning...hubby and I came in a little after 9am because other places we drove by were just stupid packed and we wanted to sit somewhere comfortable and low key with good food. I've been eyeing this place for a while now and what a perfect time to try them out. We sat by the window, we had a new waitress but she did great with timely service and great interaction. They serve chips with a yummy banana nutella spread while you wait for your meals.  We ordered tosilog for the hubby, green eggs and spam for me and shortstacks to share. The meals were delicious and hit the spot for us...we were so into our dishes that we didn't even get a chance to dig into the shortstacks - we ended up taking them home for a later splurge. I was a little bummed that they upped the prices by a couple dollars from what is listed on their website (someone needs to UPDATE that stat), but in the end it was still worth it. Eggs were cooked perfectly for both meals, the green thai butter used on mine gives it a nice kick of flavor and spice. Spam pieces were fried just right, not underdone (yes, this is possible) and not overdone. The tocino was marinated pork belly - again, great flavor and texture.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the little details incorporated into each dish...garnishing was spectacular! The chef even came by our table to check on how everything turned out - that was a very nice touch...From other reviews, it looks like kitchen efficiency can be a hit or miss I guess depending on when you get there - glad we got there when we did, because when we left, the crowd certainly picked up and it appears that the kitchen got backed up from what another review states of their experience from today as well - I remember seeing that couple come in with their baby, it's too bad they didn't get a spectacular experience.  Hubby was greatly impressed with this place and that says a lot as it's very hard to please him. We are fans!"}
{"text":"TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. I find it ironic that the name of the restaurant is \"Served\" when that is anything but what we got. I will start by saying that I was hesitant about going originally because I thought the prices were rather expensive for a local breakfast/lunch restaurant. However, based on the good reviews, we decided to try it. 

First thing to note upon walking in is that the decor and ambiance was a complete eye sore. The host seated us almost right away which then turned out to be our server as well. Drinks were ordered and served quickly. After a few minutes of reviewing the menu, we did have a question about the half portions. While asking about the half portions, the server began answering the question and then walked away while in the middle of explaining because he saw people coming in who needed to be seated. 

After a few more minutes, we placed our order. About 15 minutes passed and we began wondering when our food was going to come out. The server approached our table and asked what it was that we had ordered. This was a little concerning after we had placed our order 15 minutes prior. We reminded him of our order and continued to wait for our food. Another 15 minutes passed and no update on our food or what was going on. There were a total of 5 tables seated in the entire restaurant. A couple that came in 15 minutes after we arrived already had their food being served. Tired of waiting and with no explanation of what was going on or attention to our table considering the low volume of customers at the time, we decided to walk out. I work in the service industry and I can say that this was extremely poor customer service and organization.

If you are going to have high end food prices, at the very least, the guest is to be provided with their correct order in a timely manner with exceptional customer service to justify the prices. We received none of the above and decided to walk. No desire to return."}
{"text":"Hello Matthew,
 You are correct, when you came by our table we did tell you things were fine. If you would have checked with your staff you would have been informed that I did complain to the server that the bacon tempura was not good prior to you coming to our table. I would have thought that he would have informed you as the place wasn't to busy. We did hear him tell the kitchen staff about it. Plus if you had looked at our plates when you came to the table, I would have thought the pile of batter on the plate would have been a clue? If you didn't see it then you surly saw it when it was cleared from the table. I didn't fell it necessary to complain twice, your staff should have informed you, that is just my opinion on that. The other thing was the server did ask about a replacement, I declined. I also paid the bill in full without any compensation for an un happy customer. 
As for you being a small busy, I am trying to do my part for you. Our first meal there was great! This is an opportunity for you to hear from your customers and maybe take a look at things that need to be tweaked or changed. 
I wish you well.
This is what Yelp is for to inform and hopefully help."}
{"text":"The food and coffee were both good and that's half the battle for a breakfast spot! I had the green eggs and spam and I already can't wait to go back to try more. The layout of the restaurant is kind of odd -- the restaurant is small and it feels cramped while you are eating. The servers were both very nice but seemed to lack polish. Everyone has to start somewhere, though, right? Will be back."}
{"text":"My sister and I try to find restaurants that our 91 year old mom might enjoy, so when she and I couldn't get into another restaurant down the street last Sunday we swung by Served to check them out.  The place looked closed so I got out of the car to try the door; very glad I did as they were open. (Maybe invest in a \"We're Open\" sign?). There was a 10 minute wait as they were full but once we were seated our waitress immediately set us up with our drinks and explained the different menu items to us - different being the key word here.  There were several Eggs Benedict - I chose Pork Belly Eggs Benedict  and was deliciously surprised, the eggs were perfectly cooked and the French bread base was beautifully crisped and seasoned - along with a few Filipino breakfast items and an egg dish with green Thai chili.  There was also Huevos Rancheros with langonisa - whatever that is - that I'll try next time.  My sister had the Bam Slam consisting of two perfectly cooked eggs over easy, fluffy pancakes, crispy yet soft on the inside potato nuggets, and house bacon.  The bacon was overly sweet for our taste; they coat it with brown sugar and pepper, might like the option of regular bacon...

My only complaints relate to their selection of tea: my sister ordered hot tea and all they had were herb or green teas, no Earl Grey, Breakfast or any sort of black tea and they only offer Mango flavored ice tea; I was almost able to disguise the taste with lots of lemon.  Expand the tea selection, offer plain bacon (or less brown sugar) and you'll have a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new restaurant for breakfast/brunch today so thought we'd give Serve a try. We've eaten close to this establishment before and knew of it from driving by, and also from the Yelp reviews. 

We arrived today (Saturday) around 1030'sh. It's a small restaurant, but there were seats immediately available, as opposed to our usual restaurant where we have a 30-minute to hour wait. 

We were greeted with warm smiles and our waiter was nice and friendly. So far so good.

The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from. We ordered mimosas and water to start. After speaking with our waiter about what he recommends, we opted for the Barbacoa Benedict and Huevos Ranchero. We waited approximately 10-minutes for our meal. 

The plates came out with food looking outstanding. Beautiful and appealing to the eye. Large portions too. Then...we took our first bite....HOLY SH$T. I would've slapped my momma the food was balls to the wall legit, delicious. The Barbacoa Benedict is out of this world. Hands down the best Benedict's I've ever had in my life. Blown. Away. The Huevos Ranchero were ri-effing-diculous. Amaze. 

You know that feeling where you're torn between being pissed off because it took so long to find a gem of a restaurant, but it's so f#cking good that you're also ecstatic?!?! Yep. That was today at Served.

The chef and owner also came out while we were eating to check on everyone. Super cool guy who definitely knows his food.

Go here. Eat here. Unbelievably delicious. Going back tomorrow. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were delighted that Served is open for dinner along with happy hour (which alas we missed).

We LOVE the food for breakfast and lunch and had a wonderful meal for dinner.  I had a BLT with avocado.  I didn't count but there must have been 8-10 pieces of bacon and the heirloom tomato was amazing.  My wife had salmon tacos which were just terrific.

We had chicken wings as an appetizer.  They were with a somewhat asian flavor and without a doubt the best I've ever tasted.  (Of course, this is my reaction to most of what I've been served, at served)."}
{"text":"Not one thing was bad here! Everything was amazing! Bread pudding French toast is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great food we have eaten breakfast here a bunch of times but tonight we tried dinner and it did not disappoint. Very creative and tasty food can't wait to go back and try sometime else. The wait staff was excellent very friendly which in my book is as importantly the food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome service. Matt and Mike are incredible chefs. Definitely try it out, you won't regret it and presentation is on point"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Ordered the smoke salmon Benedict and the huevos rancheros. They have large portions. I was a bit thrown off by a guy who worked in the kitchen because he had a massive confederate flag tattoo on his arm and just looked generally unkept, but other then that everything was good."}
{"text":"Super tasty and very innovative!  Kudos to the chef!

I hope people will give this place a try because it's really worth it!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty ballin but pricy in my opinion. I went during brunch and it was kind of empty and secluded (not sure if that's always the case).

Service: We got served right away (probably because we were the only ones XD) The lady who served us was very nice and gave some great suggestions. She also filled our water frequently (very important to me!)

Food: I got the Asian BLAT which has pork belly. This sandwich was bomb! I could have eating it without the pork belly and it will still be bomb. Whatever dressing they used was delicious. The pork belly was really nicely marinated but fatty (I love it but if you don't like a giant junk of fat, maybe not). The problem for me was the pork belly was so big that I couldn't actually eat it in the sandwich. I took it out of the sandwich and cut it up and ate it in between sandwich bites. It came with potatoes which was good but I didn't really care for it. My friend got the green egg and spam with garlic rice. I didn't try it but the garlic rice smelled delicious!

Price: A bit on the pricy end in my opinion. I think 12 for my sandwich was decent especially because of the big pork belly. Spam and eggs are cheap so I couldn't justify paying 11 for green eggs and spam even with garlic fried rice. 

Ambiance: We went during a quiet time so the place was pretty empty. Inside looks really nice so this is a great place to go for a nicer meal with friends or on a date in my opinion (especially if you like trying more fusion style food)."}
{"text":"Third time here and I'm completely hooked. The service is genuine and friendly (huge improvement). The food is creative and amazing. I've tried the shrimp tacos and soft shell crab Benedict's and both I would return for. My mother in law raves about the huevos rancheros too. This is our go to spot for any meal"}
{"text":"Very good food we both got Benedicts. loved them! Bloody Mary's were great and Kona Brewing beers service was good. Chef/owner came out to make sure our food was good also"}
{"text":"Served is one of my favorite spots for breakfast and brunch. I would actually be here a lot more if it wasn't located in the boondocks (i.e. Henderson, NV).  Chef Matt is the best and don't be surprised if he leaves the kitchen to check up on you.  He's a really nice man, very generous, and passionate about his customers.  The service from his staff is just as good too.  The menu consist of an American style breakfast with an Islander twist to it.  

My Favorites:
-The Breakfast Sandwich ($10) - One of the best breakfast egg sandwiches that I have ever had.
-The Ono Wings and Rice ($10)
-Longsilog (Filipino Breakfast / $10) - 3 eggs, longanisa, & garlic fried rice.  
-The BAM Breakfast ($11) - 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 3 eggs, toast, & potatoes.  
-Asada Steak & Eggs
-The Miso Pork Belly Burger
-Chicken Breast ($5) - Not on the menu, but he'll serve it if you ask for it. 

Servings are huge and expect to get a lot for your money. Almost everything on the menu is $10 or less.  Nothing is more than $15. Chef Matt has talent, he's very humble, and I recommend Served if you're ever in the area for breakfast/brunch. 

Wish List:  Bring back some of the dinner options.  Chef Matt attempted to open for dinner a couple of months ago.  He served dishes ranging from salmon to steak. I had the opportunity to try most of his dinner entrees and all were on point.  The filet mignon with foie gras is amazing and the price was less than $40.  It's just too bad that he ended up squashing dinner.  Filet mignon for brunch?  Sold!!!


2017 Yelp Review #20"}
{"text":"I visited at 9 am on a Saturday morning for breakfast with my God-daughter (who loves Spam) along with her mom and sis.  I've heard some great things from foodie friends of how some of my favorite foods from Filipino and Korean dishes are fused perfectly with traditional American breakfast and lunch.  That kind of reminds me of Marvel Team Up comic books back in the day.

Service: 4.5/5 Our waitress was very friendly and attentive from beginning to end.  She answered all the questions from two high energy girls with much patience and a smile.  I direct messaged the business on yelp for a reservation request and got an immediate confirmation and response. Sweet..

Food: 5/5  Interesting and very tasty dishes on the menu.  Great fusion dishes offerings for breakfast and I went with The Seoul Benny: Two scallion pancakes topped with kim chi, pickled radish, Korean short rib, two poached eggs & hollandaise sauce.  The ingredients tasted high quality, fresh and was cooked perfectly.  I was especially happy with how the poached eggs and Korean Short Rib complimented each other.  Great vision.

Value: 5/5 Tasty dishes prepped with high quality ingredients for under $20 or slightly over is what I look for in value.  When I find it, you know i'll be back.  Definitely be back here for lunch soon, ijs.

Ambiance: 4/5 A very small restaurant that looks like a long wait is inevitable if the timing is wrong.  The tables are spaced perfectly and I enjoyed the over sized plates our breakfast entrees came out in.  Very foodie friendly, I dig it.

Summary: I often tell my friends that the Vegas Valley has low key transformed itself into a foodie mecca.  The celebrity chefs and restaurants on the strip are great but it's restaurants like Served that is the catalyst for this transition.  When you're getting interesting, high quality dishes around the $20 range, there's definitely competition compression with higher end restaurants.  The Free market keeps everyone honest and on their game, watch out!
Quote from the 2004 movie -You got served
\"Y'all just mad. Because today, you suckers got served, Served, SERVED, SERVED!"}
{"text":"I rarely leave 1 star especially for a restaurant...ESPECIALLY FOR A NEW LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANT!!  However this is exceptional. We entered Served after seeing Kitchen Table had a 45 minute wait. No problem. It's Sunday brunch. Everything's busy. We walk in and it is very small and quaint.  There is a family of 5 waiting at the host stand ( not talking to anyone) and we are behind them. After waiting several minutes with no acknowledgement I walked around the family and walked up to the hostess. She looked at me briefly then turned and began talking to the family. So I went back to the back of the family. After several more minutes the blonde hostess/server ( which by the way is always a great idea) walked by us and said \"it'll be a few minutes\". That is our first sort of interaction.  Okay still no problem. It's busy I understand. Now she walks by again and says \"a few more minutes is it just two\". I said yes she walked away. At this time the family is sat and we are alone up front. Then a few minutes later a couple walks in behind us. I watch as minutes go by and no one acknowledges them either. Finally I hear the man say let's go somewhere else. And they leave ( not a great way to lose business in a competitive industry with a heavy hitter in the same parking lot. It would seem to me that you probably can't afford to lose customers.). Anyways we finally get seated. The waitress (same as blonde hostess) says \" just water?\"  I reply \" yes , and\" she walked away before I could speak. We were ready to order. Waiting a while we looked at the menu and had decided. ( we grabbed our own menus, were not offered). So i was ready to catch her on the water flyby/drop off. Well no chance. She dropped and ran. ( this place has maybe 12 tables with 4 servers and a busser guy). Well we waited and waited.  I made eye contact with many people and the chef/ I believe owner.  Nothing. After about 12 minutes waiting we left. Hungry.... disappointed. Won't be back. Thanks. Great work. Still looking forward to Kitchen Table."}
{"text":"I was not expecting Served to be exceptional. It was. Few places turn out new things that are truly worth going out of your way for. Few places turn out traditional  items in a way that are truly worth going out of your way for. Served does both. The chef is a young superstar. Go."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The items on the menu allow you to explore famous dishes around the world in just one restaurant. We ordered the Longsilog, Crispy Baked Berry French Toast, the Huevos Rancheros, the Softshell Crab Benedict, mimosas and coffee. Every dish was absolute perfection, and the mimosas were very light and bubbly. There were 2 Filipinos and a Mexican in the group and we were all very happy!! The one thing I was unhappy about was the decaf coffee. My decaf tasted bitter, so much that I asked for another cup. Unfortunately, it was still bitter, so I couldn't enjoy a cup of decaf. I tasted my friend's regular cup of coffee and hers was not bitter, so it must be in the decaf coffee they chose. Please fix the decaf blend, because then it would have been the best breakfast ever!! However, even with the coffee flop, I honestly can't wait to come here again! If you're deciding between Kitchen Table and Served, definitely choose Served- you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I don't come here everyday, but I am a repeat customer and do on occasions go out of my way to come here. This place is a quiet joint, but even with that sometimes has slow table service. For examplex today we sat there for nearly two hours and not because we were having some revolutionary conversation we were sucked into. Food is amazing, no doubt. You must try this place for yourself and create your own opinion. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Place is off the charts! You never guess that this place serves some of the best food in Vegas...they play with some exotic dishes...using color and textures to amplify each bite. It's a wonderful place to enjoy Brunch. The chef walks around to make sure everything is up to his standards. Truly a gem!"}
{"text":"Gonna try out a new tl;dr thing today.

PROS:

(+) solid treatment of proteins overall
(+) French toast is god tier
(+) delicious happy hour items (some of which seem to be lifted directly from regular menu and heavily discounted) [HH: 2-6pm daily]

CONS:

(-) inconsistent service on my two visits
(-) inconsistent potatoes
(-) some issues with \"charring\"

=======

Served is the most recent arrival of a breakfast/lunch renaissance in Henderson, with three local-centric restaurants offering food that's a step up from diners. Daunted somewhat by the variety of reportedly delicious dishes, I finally found a nice opportunity for a lunchtime meal with a trio of diners, including a friend visiting town and her colleague. I also made a follow-up solo visit during happy hour.

The menu looks pricey compared to the other \"brenaissance\" spots, but all of the entrees in our group meal fell in the $11-$20 range, which accounts for most of the breakfast/lunch menu here. These dishes are big enough to share, and we ended up with copious amounts of leftovers.

But first, we had to wait. It took over 35 minutes for us to get the order, and the kitchen gave no recompense or explanation. They brought out cinnamon sugar chips with a Nutella dip, but even that took 20 minutes and seems to be a free snack for all diners according to other reviews. I truly hope that this was an isolated incident.

When we finally received our food, our server announced the wrong order as the benedict. I barely caught it before first bites. I later learned that our server was brand-new, but that's still no excuse for that or for her relative inattention throughout the meal.

Baked Berry French Toast ($16): I was almost ready to forgive everything after the first bite. The bread-pudding-as-French-toast was awesome. The juicy berries, crunchy sliced almonds, sweet bourbon glaze, and even the rich whipped cream were all perfect complements. I could've devoured the whole thing without flavor fatigue and been satisfied for breakfast.

Roast Pork Belly Benedict ($15): all the pork was tender enough and pretty tasty. The julienne chilis brought heat in some bites. The poached eggs were a little overdone, with at most half of the yolk staying in glorious golden liquid form. Unfortunately, half of the potato hash was overdone if not \"charred.\" The seasoning was fine, but there has to be consistency/evenness in the cooking. Also, I just realized that we'd intended to order the \"Crispy\" Pork Belly Benedict, so that's another newbie server issue. Nobody else noticed, so I guess it's not-much harm, not-much foul?

Lomo Saltado ($18): ...not much consistency between plates either. The potatoes on this dish were actually a little undersalted. The dish was good otherwise, with the beef containing the salt, the plantains providing the expected sweet and tender accompaniment, and both tomatoes and red onions turning out properly cooked.

=======

Eyeing the 2-6pm daily happy hour menu, which prominently features tacos ($3 each, 6 options), sliders, ($5 each, 7 options), and the loaded nuggets appetizer ($5 a plate, 2 options), I came back a couple of days later to give them another shot. I got an experienced server who walked me through several of his favorite menu items. I went for a varied, big order, and I stopwatched the arrival of the tacos at about 15 minutes post-order; the sliders and nuggets followed within 10 minutes after that.

Each taco comes on two semi-crispy 4-inch tortillas, and none which I ordered were spicy. The Birria was a delicious marinated beef taco that tastes like something traditionally Mexican. The Fish isn't the fluffiest, but it's crispy and goes well with the provided lime wedge. The Shrimp Tempura was easily my favorite, with plump shrimp popping in my mouth with every bite. Its mother would be so proud.

I went for the sliders corresponding to the priciest burgers, the Umami and the Wellington. They're maybe 3 inches in diameter at best, and they come skewered. The only notable missing ingredient compared to the full-size version is eggs, but they were both still delicious, albeit a little salty. The Umami had a nice monkfish liver and I loved the yuzu aioli, but the nori was too clunky and hard to bite through. Shredded nori would've been better. As for the Wellington, I loved the cheese and crispy potato strings, and aside from one or two burnt mushroom bits, I can see why this is my server's favorite burger.

Finally, I eyed the Longanisa Nuggets and realized that I had to get a to-go box. The plate is massive. The egg was also omitted here, but it was pretty good and very filling. I loved the cheese, salsa, avocado, and sweet sausage. The potatoes were more consistent this time, but they're not excellent still.

Served turned out to be a pretty good place when considering the best parts of two visits. I'll definitely return for HH and I'll probably give more of their regular menu a try, including their on-again dinner."}
{"text":"I found this place here on Yelp and saw really good reviews. So, we decided to go try them. This restaurant is cute and little. Very well decorated and the hostess/waitress (wife of the chef) she was very nice and helpful. I got the bread pudding fruit French toast, very delicious! And also very filling lol, I took home half. My husband got the burger with tots. He was very happy with his good :) we also saw the chef so it was pretty cool to see him communicating with his guests. We will back :)"}
{"text":"So...where to start, let me say for the most part the food was good. Not fantastic. Not amazing. But good. The service? Abysmal. Seemed like unless a customer is of Asian decent you had to wait for everything. Chips and salsa were tossed at us. Took forever for the server to take out order. Even longer to get a coffee refill. Once the food arrived it was okay. My husband's bacon was barely cooked though, rendering it inedible. Save yourself the time and go to Kitchen Table at the other end of the parking lot. Outstanding food. Outstanding service and mimosas & bellinis to beat the band."}
{"text":"Found restaurant off Yelp, great hidden gem near my home. 15% off with Yelp Check In. 

Restaurant is on smaller side - 48 seats or less. Comfortable, casual vibe. 

Salmon panang is flavorful, spicy and not salty. Salmon perfectly cooked with crispy skin, not dry. Great assortment of vegetables and just the right amount of sauce. Rice reminded me of Thai sticky rice but I'm not sure, taste great tho. 

Cheeseburger was a hit, huge by the way. 

I appreciate the owner/chef touching tables and engaging with guests. 

Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich I ever had. My pregnant wife ordered the short rib Benedict, and the server and chef were very accommodating by making the hollandaise sauce to-order by cooking it more thoroughly. Wonderful experience and amazing food!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Arrived during the week just after they opened and was the first table to be seated. I was a little concerned there wasn't other customers but the place started filling up soon.

I went with the corn beef hash which is made in house with request of rye bread. The corn beef was lean and lite tasting, potatoes cooked perfectly with farm fresh eggs. I tried the Filipino sausage, garlic fried rice and it was solid tasting too. Servings are generous here and the owner/ chef came out to see how we enjoyed our meal. Service from our waitress was cordial.

If your into breakfast like myself, you'll heart dining at served."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on Yelp and noticed the reviews are better than at Kitchen Table. After eating here I realized why. This place is attractive and the staff is friendly and attentive. And of course the food is spectacular. I got the soft shell crab Benedict - everything was cooked perfectly. The eggs were delicious and the sauce and biscuit - melt in your mouth! The soft shell crab was crispy and tender. The potatoes were hot and delicious. Beautiful presentation. Plenty of food - my husband was happy to get the leftovers! My mom got the green eggs and spam - the Thai butter was delicious and the spam was delightful! We also got two mimosas that were also very good! I like this place much better than Kitchen Table which is practically next door. I will be back! Can't wait to try it out for lunch! So happy to have this place so close to home!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch! 

I ordered the bam slam, and it came with 2 eggs, spam, potatoes, and pancakes! This place is kinda hidden, in a newer plaza but all the food was delicious! The portion wasn't big, but it was enough for 1 person. It was delicious, and I loved how soft my scrambled eggs were. The only downside was my pancakes seem to be more burnt than I wanted. I like my pancakes more soft and fluffy! 

Overall, it was a good experience to eat brunch at while I was visiting Vegas. I'd come here again if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in this area, hands down. It's tucked back into the corner of a business-type plaza, so the location is not obvious. I crave their breakfast hash and make special trips here just to order it. They also have some unique burger options. I have tried one of the burgers, but typically stick with the breakfast items. The last time I brunched here, the complimentary appetizer while we waited for our entrees was cinnamon pita chips with a banana Nutella dip. Oh man! It was an extremely tasty combo. 

The service here is always excellent and the chef (he may be the owner too?) comes out to ask how everything is tasting. Just writing about this food makes me want to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Quite pleased with another small business eatery located not too far from my home. Served was the choice for eating out with my workout pals one day to celebrate a birthday. Having never been to Served I was at first a tad apprehension when we arrived at noonish and it was almost completely dead minus a table of customers finishing their meals. 
Our table of thirteen was seated at the back of the smallish place, and natural wooden chairs and tables, large windows with light set the relaxed mood. 
Menus given, there is a breakfast side and a lunch side, as well as beer and wine. Mimosas all around minus myself who got a cold IPA from Kona Brewery started the soirée. A platter of French toasts bites and a couple bowls of homemade chips, cinnamon sugar with Nutella and cheesy spicy chips and salsa. Delish. Food ordered varied from breakfast to lunch, but everyone commented that it was excellent and I have to agree. 
Bill for 3-4 bottles of champagne, appetizers, twelve plates of food and my one beer, $250 minus tip. 
Service was friendly and attentive, and when we left the place had filled up a lot. 
Would return."}
{"text":"I was \"served\" at SERVED my $12.00 \"house roasted Turkey\" sandwich on everyday Wheat bread with it's \"side\" of Mac salad.  Sorry Served but really $12.00 for Turkey that that has been sliced so thin and I mean it was so thin it was translucent and completely tasted like something out of an market bought plastic package. (actually some of the market brands are much better tasting than this so call house roasted turkey was. How about some nice thicker cuts of turkey on a $12.00 sandwich??  The Mac salad side dish was really good but it was served in a thimble size tin cup that is usually used for something like Ketcup."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I know I could here two months straight, try something different every time and still give 5 stars. Terrific food, great staff, phenomenal experience. The recommendations were absolutely on point and explained very well to some one like me who is not refined when it comes to food. Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Pancakes, tosilog, green eggs.  Ohh man I'm in heaven. Everything is delicious .  Service is great .  Chef Matt came out check on us.  All I can say I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. I can't believe this place wasn't packed when I went. We shared the pork belly Benedict and the soft shell crab Benedict. Presentation and the service also spot on. my new fav breakfast spot and will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I eat out quite a bit during the work week and I'm always looking for new places to try vs. chain spots and this one was a random Gem of a find! The food was fantastic gourmet style but without the price! It's small and cozy warm lighting great place for lunch with friends or a date! The chef came out and introduced himself the server was a doll check it out. I felt like I was supporting local business too."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  I came in for brunch on a Saturday about 11 AM and was immediately seated by the hostess who then took my drink order.  I had the smoked salmon Benedict.  Everything was so fresh and tasted perfect.  Service was great and the mimosa was even better!  Definitely coming back here!  It's like strip food but decent pricing and close by.  Yay!!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this resturant! From the friendly & efficient service, abundance & variety of the menu, and most importantly the delicious flavors of the food! I can't wait to come back and I might just be a regular! 

It's in a business park, the building in middle, on the corner, not near the street. Lots of parking and easy to find. Interior and bathroom is clean and trendy. 

Server Shawn and Chef Matt was very attentive and quick. Matt has a great attention to detail and really makes his food with the utmost quality. They made sure I was doing well, and food was to my liking. I also appreciated the small detail of a warm towel it wipe my hands. 

I highly recommend all the Happy Hour (7 days a week, 2-6PM) items I got:
$3 Shrimp Tempura Taco
$5 Umami Slider 
$5 Ono wings 

I also asked the chef for an egg and he made me a delicious Ramen egg. I got the mango iced tea, and thought it was okay at first with one packet of sugar, but surprisingly complemented and balanced my meal very well. My meal had so many savory and unique flavors, which I love, that the drink was a nice way to calm it down. 

The creme brûlée flavor of the day was an orange cream and summed up my meal perfectly. Not to sweet, just right! The fresh oranges on top was a nice touch. It is a good size to share and since I was so full I couldn't finish it myself. 

I wish I had a bigger tummy to try everything on the menu, but that will have to wait for my next visit. Instead, I got some food to go for my lunch tomorrow! 

I love the fusion flavors of this resturant and it looks like there is something for everyone. I highly recommend this resturant and happy hour if you're eating alone or with a group. Great food to share!"}
{"text":"I have two things to say about this restaurant - Pork Belly Eggs Benedict and bread pudding french toast.  So delicious.... we have to share.  

We've only strayed once to order the apple pancakes that are also a masterpiece.  Some day I want to try the Short Rib Eggs Benedict, but it is hard to pass on my first two choices, because they are so yummy and I dream about them.  They have a bread pudding corn beef hash dish that sounds very interesting also.  All the food looks good.  They also have some Filipino favorites as well if you are into that.  There is something for everyone.

The staff is friendly and eager to please, the chef has come to our table every time we have been there...a very nice touch.

This place is a hidden (literally) gem, in the back of the parking lot on the corner of Horizon and Valle Verde.  The location means not everyone has discovered it yet so it is not crowded....yet.  If you love great food, that is unusual you will love this place."}
{"text":"I usually take at least 5 minutes to decide what I want off a menu, however at Served, it took me 15 minutes and I was still hemming and hawing when the waiter came. The menu is filled with the most interesting, mixed plates and it's hard to decide what sounds really appetizing and what sounds a little too weird of a combo.
The restaurant is very small and has what looks like leftover carpeting from a previous tenant. First walking in, I was a little worried that I had chose the wrong place and that the Yelp reviews were all a lie, but DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU AWAY. 
Corned beef bread pudding benedict: Oh. my gosh. The texture of this plate was perfect. Corned beef is usually too salty for me, but the one at Served didn't have me downing waters. I wasn't too sure what part was bread pudding and what part was benedict, but the combo worked. 
Pork belly benedict: Separately, the benedict and the pork belly were not the best I've had, but the combo made it good. It was all a little dry, but after popping the egg, it was fine. 
Blueberry Pancakes: We ordered something \"normal,\" just in case the \"cultural favorites- redefined\" dishes didn't work out. The pancakes were definitely some of the best I've had. Huge stack for a much lower price than other entrees on the menu! 
The serve breakfast and lunch all day. The presentation of the food is adorable and the waiters were very friendly. It's the perfect place to come with a date, a SMALL group of friends or even maybe your hip mom. It's too small for large groups and their eclectic menu may be too much for grandma and grandpa, if their idea of breakfast is 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon and hash browns. 
It almost hurts me to write this review. As much as I want Served to succeed, I also want it to stay secret and hidden. The restaurant is so small, I'm worried that coming in on a weekend would be impossible with a bigger following."}
{"text":"Delicious! My first visit. I have been hearing rumblings about trying this place so I had to stop by. I came in on a Saturday for brunch. First impression walking in was this place is smaller than I would have expected. The server sat us and was very friendly. My friend and I shared the pork belly benedict and the  shrimp tempura tacos. Both were amazing, but my favorite was the tacos. The shrimp was nice and plump and the sauce was just amazing. I was actually sad that I only had 1 and a half because we shared.The presentation and color of the food just screamed, \"eat me!\". I also had coffee, which was so smooth. Yum! 

The owner came by and checked on us to see if everything was going well. I did not realize he was the owner at first and I didn't catch his name, but he was very respectable and was really genuine about making sure we had a good experience. 

Served seems to be picking up by word of mouth because driving by I would not have noticed it. Maybe they are planning for all the doctors to come in from the nearby offices? This place needs to be in the district! I hope this place picks up and can get a bigger, better location. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Really good food. We ordered the Peruvian lomo saltado and the corn beef, they both were delicious. I'm originally from Peru so I was excited to try their lomo saltado. It was all good. The coffee was great too. It's a nice little place. It might need more lighting, otherwise it's a good place!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the Horizon Ridge area.

I found this place on Yelp after searching for a Saturday brunch spot. It was off the beaten path but I decided to give it a shot after drooling over the photos posted on their Yelp review.

To start the staff were super friendly and thorough in explaining the menu. We had mimosas while deciding on our meal.

I had the pork Benedict and I was actually sad when I took my last bite. Absolutely delicious. My dining partner opted for the Oreo crusted banana Nutella French toast. I sampled it and loved it. It was very rich and more of a dessert than breakfast.

I'll be moving to Las Vegas soon and I will make this my go to brunch spot."}
{"text":"Served is quickly becoming one of my favorite brunch/breakfast places in Vegas. I was almost surprised that they weren't as busy when I called ahead on a Sunday morning. Even so, I can see Served becoming ever more popular based on food alone, and if this place isn't on your list of go-to's for brunch, it should be.

The waiters/waitresses are so inviting and friendly that you feel like you're part of a community of sorts. The chef came out and introduced himself to every table, and I think it's the small things like this that make you want to come back and bring all your friends.

After you order and are just waiting for the food, you get some complimentary snacks. You know how Mexican restaurants give you chips and salsa or how an Italian restaurant gives you bread and olive oil? Well Served goes one step further and gives you cinnamon sugar chips and a Nutella dip. The dip itself is pretty light and gives you just enough of that chocolate hazelnut flavor without feeling like you're dipping the entire thing in a jar of Nutella. 

We got the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict and the BAM Slam with blueberry pancakes. The BAM Slam was perfect. The breakfast potatoes aren't your average deep fried/dry potatoes. They have a crisp exterior and a soft, warm interior. They definitely have a heft to them. If you're not careful (like me), you'll eat all the potatoes first, get full, and realize that you still haven't tried the rest of your food. First world problem, I know. The bacon is thick cut and has a little sweetness to it. The pancakes were fluffy and cooked well. The roasted pork belly benedict was really well prepared as well. All the flavors balanced very well.

Overall, the food is incredibly well prepared, the service is amazing, and you most likely won't be disappointed when you come here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem - amazing food, you literally can't go wrong with anything you order! Oh and happy hour is every day until 6pm! The best!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! Food options were very different and I was excited to see an Asian Fusion style breakfast. We all had different dishes, and each were solid. Service was good as well. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Now that I've been here three times I need to update my review to reflect how much I love this restaurant. Each time I return I find that improvements have been made to a place that is already so great. 

The menu offers a great variety of options. On the weekends they offer both lunch and breakfast options. Breakfast options not only include dishes like benedicts and French toast, but also Filipino breakfast items. The lunch menu is extensive as well and includes burgers, salads, tacos, and more Filipino dishes. It would take awhile to work your way through all of the menu options. The chef also seems to experiment with new dishes often which further adds to the nice variety of menu items.

Every food item I've had here, lunch or breakfast, has been delicious. Most recently I ordered the Short Rib Benedict. Every last bite of this was delicious. The short rib was tender with a delicious flavor in every bite. The sourdough bread instead of the traditional English muffin was a step up from the usual. The bread was buttery and the poached egg was perfectly prepared. The hollandaise sauce was tasty. The breakfast potatoes on the side were crispy and nicely seasoned. My husband had the Teriyaki Burger which was out of this world and paired with also out of this world Crispy Potato Nuggets on the side.

The service is always friendly and welcoming. Our waitress on our recent visit was great, checking on us frequently and providing friendly service. During two of my visits the chef came out and talked to all of the tables to make sure everyone was happy with their food. I love when a chef/owner cares enough to come out and talk to their customers."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Group of 5 of us everything we ordered was good if you are here for breakfast French toast by far best French toast I've ever had! Chef came out checked on us really nice guy will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!!! Delicious food, beautiful presentation, and friendly service. Also a family friendly restaurant. Chef was so kind, he came to our table to make sure we enjoyed our food and he even offer to bring us some bananas for our little one. So sweet! What an amazing dinning experience!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and prompt. Portions are huge and well made. The head chef even came out to greet us and ask how all the plates were. Will go back again. If u like breakfast with an Asian twist, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visiting from out if town and was recommended by local. Party of six went and all were very impressed.  Great variety of choices certainly not your average burger stop!!!  Staff friendly and knowledgeable .   Line should be out door if in l.a.!!!  Was on 2 week  driving trip and this was best of all!



In Vegas about a month later and decided to try again -  not disappointed - best flan I've ever had.  Worth going out of way just for the French toast -totally unique!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and it was another fantastic experience.  The food and service are amazing.  The chef has come to my table each time to be sure everything is just right .  It's apparent that the chef takes great pride in his work from the presentation of the plate to the flavors in each meal. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Loved the menu at this place. I went in for breakfast and tried the Longsilog (Filipino breakfast) and my boyfriend got he Bam Slam. I loved the garlic rice and the Longanisa sausage! My boyfriend loved the bacon and pancakes. Both meals were super filling. This place is small but service is great and we didn't have to wait long. I look forward to trying the rest of the menu for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here today everything was fresh and tasty really liked the potatoes seasoned just right our waiter was Mark gave us first class services the only bad thing I can say is it was a little on the cool inside the restaurant"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new near our neighborhood and we were pleasantly surprised with the delicious food served at SERVED! The food portions are extremely generous but so tasty we actually finished all of our dishes .  They served some traditional Filipino favorites that I loved and my kids devoured the tempura apple pancakes and corned beef hash.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food was great. We walked in a bit hesitant because of the dark room and dirty carpet. Unfortunately that can turn someone away. We ordered and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was! Seriously. I would suggest that management just get a new floor (finished concrete or tile) as some may think dirty floors equal dirty kitchen which was not the case here. 

Burger was great"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Serve was an unpleasant one, but Chef Matt personally invited us back to give it a second chance.

Chef Matt brought us the Crispy Baked Berry French Toast,  Soft Shell Crab Benedict and Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict, which were all amazing.  I have never been a fan of egg Benedict because of the hollandaise sauce and Chef Matt changed my mind. The hollandaise sauce was perfect on top of the perfectly cooked egg. The portions were just right and the presentation was beautiful.

I can appreciate a business that truly cares about their customers. We will be coming back to try the other culinary delights on the menu."}
{"text":"Out of this world good! I walked in and was greeted by a lovely lady named, Linda. Being that it was my first time, Linda, recommended I try the soft shell crab benni. This dish was definitely 5 star quality. It was $18 or $19 bucks but so worth it. Chef Mark came out to make sure everything was on point. And he brought out a nice sample of the BBQ Eel with quail egg on a tiny toast of bread. Perfect combination as well. I'm looking forward to coming back to try more amazing dishes. Great food. Taste & prevention. 

Ps. They open from 9am-5pm. Dinner hours are in the near future."}
{"text":"Served is an awesome place in Henderson to get a great meal at a great price. Seriously get the french toast, it's amazing. The owner is super nice and the staff are always friendly and accommodating, especially when I go visit with my two year old."}
{"text":"Very low key, unpretentious place with great food and a super inventive menu.  The chef was personally very attentive and came out to check on us and was eager for feedback, knowing we were out of towners in Henderson for business.  

I mentioned to him that the food was spot on, and expressed surprise about the portion size and super reasonable pricing.  His response was that he wanted his patrons to feel like they got great food and an even better deal.

With the variety and quality of the overall menu I see this place as a can't miss for the next time i come out that way.  Give this place a chance if you have an appetite for something different... Strip quality food at off strip prices."}
{"text":"All I can say is amazing. Best food I've eaten in awhile. Great service and food was brought out by the chef himself. Will def be back for seconds and thirds. And from the empty plates and the \"oh my god this is amazing\" from others around me I think they would agree."}
{"text":"Portions are huge. Food was very tasty. Can't belove this place is right next Tim my neighborhood and I never went."}
{"text":"We went back for my first  dinner experience , my second time to eat here, my partners 5th...
The food was excellent. Service was  perfect....
One of the most eclectic menus in our city.   Breakfast is a real special treat.
Try this wonderful little surprise in Henderson. You will not be disappointed.
Ciao"}
{"text":"So so good. I've had it on my list for awhile and so glad I finally came. This chef loves all the same stuff as me. Some Peruvian, Korean, and more. The chips and salsa are even delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! Lots of unique dishes, great for breakfast and lunch. Nice change from the typical brunch places."}
{"text":"First timers here! Found out about this place from yelp and got drawn in by the amazing pictures. The server was so friendly and funny and helpful. He was very personable and a joy to talk to. The chef even came out to see how everything was. The food was absolutely mind blowing! I had the pork belly fried rice....10/10 recommend. My friend had the Wellington burger...a little pricey but amazing overall. I enjoyed this place and can't wait to be back especially to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"The food here is indulging. Big portions, Filipino and cultural undertones. You can also find breakfast basics if you're so inclined to share your breakfast table with basic people who like French toast and things. I have tried the Huevos Rancheros and the Salmon Curry. I HIGHLY suggest the salmon curry. The edges are charred slightly, the rice is delicious and the curry is flavorful but not spicy. This dish is hearty, and has cute little vegetables along the plate. The chef always comes out to ask how your meal is-which is just lovely. They also have fresh squeezed juices. They might even have little secret fruit trees in the back. Not sure. Either way, if you're in the Hendertucky area, check this place out! The only downfall on this place is it's lack of comfort and aesthetic."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I had the soft shell crab Benedict and loved the lemony sauce and tempura-fried crab. It is hard to find because it is in a building behind a building. We drove around until we were rewarded by the entrance. Kind service. Met the chef! We'll return soon."}
{"text":"I've loved Served for years and really need to come here more often. I'm happy that they're now open for dinner on certain days because the dinner menu is just as delicious as the menu they've had for years.

The space is tucked away and you wouldn't know it existed unless you were specifically looking for it. The dining area is small, but modern.

Everything I've ever had is delicious, creative, visually appealing, and cooked to perfection. The flavors are well developed. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Most of the time you'll even see owner/chef Matt Meyer come out to make sure your meal is going well, which demonstrates the level of care Served is trying to give its customers."}
{"text":"This is definitely a must try joint.  It's hidden in the back of a business complex. It's a small cute restaurant that offered Asian, Peruvian and American food. I opted for the Pork Belly Benedict and I was not disappointed.  The pork belly was very tender and not too fatty.  A very thick cut, about an inch I would say.  It's over a sour dough instead of an English muffin which was a great choice.  The hollandaise was not thick and not runny.  The house potatoes was amazing and had a little kick.  My mom ordered the homemade longsilog and it was perfect! They even added atchara (pickled papaya)and vinegar which is unusual at most American places. The service was great! Cassandra was always refilling our water and always so pleasant to talk to.  The chef came around to check on us and offered to get us anything else.  Something rare now a days."}
{"text":"We got Served!... 

Fish tacos and the secret menu item, Justin's Special. Troy was our server and he gave us very good recommendation. The fish tacos were very crispy and full of flavor. Justin's special was a great upgrade to the KFC burger for my very hungry friend."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. You can tell the chef here personally has his hand in every meal that goes to the customer. Sits back off the road just a tad but it is well worth it. Great job!"}
{"text":"We went for a brunch here. They did a really nice twist on all menu items. The ambiance is more like a hipster diner and the staff is quite friendly. If you are looking for an upscale fun meal, check them out. Your taste buds will appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Reviewing this comparatively new restaurant pains me because I want to favor owner/chef restaurants that feature innovative menus, but our experience was truly underwhelming.  I initially decided against dining here after reviewing the menu and discovering prices were relatively high, but changed my mind after reading many stellar reviews.  

I had no problem locating the restaurant in the business park, but on arrival it looked to be closed at 10AM on Tuesday morning.  There is no parking immediately in front so we trudged over and tested the door which was open.  Our charming waitress said the blinds remain closed in the morning because of the heat generated from the sun.  The restaurant is very ordinary with minimal attention given to aesthetics.

In a less than surprising decision, my wife ordered the baked berry French toast (sliced bread pudding, seasonal berries, sliced almond, powdered sugar and a barbecue glaze). I initially ordered the corned beef bread pudding Benedict, but was told the kitchen was out of corned beef so my second choice was the roasted pork belly Benedict served with breakfast potatoes.  Both entrees suffered from overcooking including my eggs, sourdough crostini and potatoes. Her French toast was cut into small squares that were totally dried up even after adding syrup. 

The absence of any other customers during our entire visit may suggest others have come to the conclusion that the elevated menu prices are not justified by the quality of the food."}
{"text":"The pork belly benedict was amazing!!!  The flavor of the pork belly was to die for and the breakfast potatoes were perfectly seasoned.  5-star all the way!"}
{"text":"What a great lil breakfast/lunch spot in Henderson! The space is not big, but it's really clean and inviting. Quite a few people were already there. Families, couples, and small groups were dining. Upscale casual would be the decor. We were greeted and seated right away and were given cinnamon sugar chips with I think cocoa-cream dipping sauce on the side. It reminded me of cinnamon toast crunch. Unexpected and yum! I ordered the KFC - Korean Fried Chicken sandwich with potato nuggets for the side. I did ask for the Kim chi, relish, and anything that would have been on the sandwich on the side because I wasn't sure what to expect. The chicken is really tasty and really crispy. I added the kim chi, relish back into the sandwich and it marinated and slightly softened the crispy chicken which was much tastier than my original thought of having everything on the side. The potato nuggets were well seasoned and not salty. Actually everything I had was just perfectly seasoned and the presentation was well executed.The Spare Rib sandwiches was really impressive along with the sweet potato fries. Quality and freshness is definitely the cornerstone for the chef. At the end, I was really full and so happy I came to check this place out. I'm glad to know there's such a special spot like this place for breakfast and lunch. Prices are moderate, but the selection and quality is well worth it. I didn't get a chance to catch the server's name, but she was friendly and attentive. Also, there business card says they do catering so I will keep this place in mind for special events. Overall, great quality food, friendly service, and a chef that can really cook. This place is legit! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is tucked away and unless you were actively looking for it, you wouldn't even notice. I visited with a friend and her kids and they already had a table ready for us as we walked in the door (the server had seen us getting out of the car).

To start our meal, we were served Cinnamon Chips with a Banana Nutella Dip to start and whoa, this was beyond delicious. The chips were light and crispy (there were other seasonings as well, however, I can't remember what they were) and the dip was fantastic. I believe this is served during breakfast/brunch only?

At the urging of another patron, my friend ordered their coffee and it was very tasty! I had found out where they get their coffee, but of course, I can't remember and I don't know where I had seen or heard it. Either way, I've seen people raving about the coffee in multiple reviews, so the coffee is a must.

I like the uniqueness of the menu and the play on classics; that's my favorite type of dishes. So, obviously, there was so much I wanted to try! Even though we were there during breakfast, they still offered their lunch menu (so awesome).

Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict ($17): Fresh marble rye bread pudding, corned beef hash, poached eggs, and hollandaise. I was the most excited about this plate because it bascially combines my favorite foods into ONE MEGA DISH. The bread pudding was a really cool because it was made to be more savory and the rye gave it a nice distinctive flavor. The corned beef hash was very tasty and had a nice crust. The \"benedict\" of poached eggs and hollandaise rounded out this neat combination. The eggs were inconsistently cooked; one was a decent poach whereas the other one was way overdone (no runny yolk). Anyway, this dish was absolutely delicious and something I'd order again! Side note: I just realized the menu says it's served with breakfast potato, but I didn't get anything.

LongSiLog ($13): Filipino breakfast; three eggs, Longanisa (sausage), garlic fried rice, Atchara (pickled papaya), and vinegar sauce. A traditional Filipino breakfast with its own mash-up of a name; Longanisa, Sinangag (fried rice) and Pritong Itlog (fried egg). Though I have experience with longanisa and garlic fried rice, the combination of ingredients and flavors was new to me. The overall flavor profile I got was \"vinegar-y\" and almost sour because of the pickling and sauce. I didn't really love it, but it is a good dish and I'm sure if you grew up with LongSiLog, this is a welcomed comfort meal."}
{"text":"Love the creative and fun approach to the menu. The concept of the restaurant involves blending the flavors of American, Filipino, Peruvian and Korean cuisine. The outcome is mostly surprising and gastronomically satisfying. The cinnamon crispy flat bread with a serving of blended Nutella and banana was a creative substitute to the traditional bread. The tacos come with a serving of rice and white beans which was tasty. I would visit this restaurant to try their food!"}
{"text":"Matthew & I arrived at Served after a somewhat rough morning. Being a 23 year old female, I just can't help my mood swings but somehow I can always be pacified with a nice breakfast & an absurd amount of coffee. 

Make sure you have Google Maps up & running when you set out on your breakfast journey because this place is a little tucked away. Located behind a doctors office in a somewhat empty center, we wondered whether anyone would be home when we got there. Don't let its remote location turn you off though. Once inside, we were greated warmly and seated in a quaint spot by the window. The decor is simple, yet elegant and modern and the service was timely and efficient. 

The menu itself was unique to say the least. My craving for breakfast food drew us in, but we quickly switched our focus to lunch when the menu revealed that all their items have an Asian twist to them. 

I ordered Papusas and Matthew ordered the Corn Beef Hash. The food was beautifully prepared and the ingredients were fresh, but we came to grub on some good food and unfortunately the meal was better on the eyes then in the tummy. 

As pretty as it looked, both meals were rather bland and lacked any sort of distinct flavor. The beef on my papusa was slightly overcooked & therefore a bit dry and its accompanying coleslaw lacked the spice & flavor that typically gives this dish its wow factor. 

Matthew's hash was good but not great. The hash itself consisted of a rye bread concoction (or so it tasted) as the hash, and a minimal amount of beef. As a real CBH lover, he was hungry enough to eat it all, but not thrilled enough to come back. 

I'd say this place is worth a visit depending on what you look for in a restaurant. If good service & presentation is high up on your list of requirements, check it out. If you're a food connoisseur with a perfect palate, a different breakfast joint might better suit your fancy."}
{"text":"Had the Korean tacos. Beef as delicious however, do not get the garlic rice. Very greasy and it should be called mashed garlic instead.  Service was slow. Expect a long wait."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how to rate this place based on our experience. We were the first people in the restaurant and by the time our food was ready, the entire restaurant was full and EVERY SINGLE PERSON had received their food prior to us. We asked if we could just pay for our appetizer and drinks and we would leave but our food had just finished so they made it to go and STILL charged us! Oh with a $7.00 discount haha! Not sure if it has anything to do with race but just gonna say that I am Hawaiian Japanese and my husband is black and we were the ONLY colored family in there and both military. It's unfortunate because I was really excited to finally try this place."}
{"text":"One of our best breakfast/brunch finds. The menu consists of plates that are a fusion of our favorite breakfast items and Korean, Filipino, and Peruvian flair. Everything we ordered was delicious and flavorful. It was my \"cheat meal\" and every bite was totally worth it
Service was also excellent. The staff was very attentive, welcoming ,and professional."}
{"text":"We went to your restaurant twice before and the food we ordered were just so so. I figured maybe if we order something different we might find something good. We took my daughter and son-in-law for lunch today and boy was i embarassed of the food they ordered. One order was the tripple decker turkey sandwich, i figured what can go wrong with a turkey sandwich? I have never seen a turkey sandwich made out of a canned turrkey meat. The other one was a fish taco. The fish was taken from a frozen breaded fish and fried. The fried rice wad soooo oily with no taste at all.
NTC"}
{"text":"Fabulous hidden gem!  Food was outstanding-very fresh, good service.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from a friend and went to Check it out last Saturday morning. We had the Huevos Rancheros and pork belly Benedict. Both were excellent. Service was good. We loved it and definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Uh. May. Zing!!! We came for a post-wedding celebration and I had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Th Burger itself is a little on the small side, (compared to the classic cheeseburger) but it was honestly perfect for my appetite. The meat was juicy and the burger was stacked high with a knife to hold everything in place. 

We also tried a crispy fish taco and the shrimp tempura taco. Both were big in flavor, but I have to say the crispy fish was the favorite. 

The Misses ended up getting th classic cheeseburger and let me tell you, it was HUGE! (;P) Paired with the flavorful, crispy potato nuggets and the perfect amount of cheese, this burger was bomb. 

We would definitely come back to try everything on the menus. Kudos to the chef and friendly and cool af staff."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with the family. I guess I should have ordered the dessert looking pancakes and waffles. I ordered your typical breakfast and they do not carry sausage here. I do not like bacon so they offered this red looking sausage that I was not a fan of at all. The vibe was nice and chef took the time to come out and ensure everything tasted good."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to Yelp but this locally owned fusion restaurant was amazing. For lunch, I ordered the Galbi tacos and omg if you like kimchee and Korean beef this was an amazing dish. My daughter ordered blueberry pancakes with longganisa sausage and my husband got the crab Benedict. All dishes unique with its own flair. It was tasty, affordable and fresh. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! The food, service, and presentation was awesome! Talk about a business that strides in quality, customer service, and creativeness. We had the Crab Benedict was was amazing and the BAM Slam with the world's best bacon. They start you off with made from scratch tortilla chips and salsa which are to die for (we even got an order to go) keep doing what you are doing this place definitely gets !"}
{"text":"I love to brunch and I can say this is one of the tastiest breakfasts I've ever had. Such unique flavors and I savored every bite. I had the tempura apple pancakes and it had a perfect balance of tartness to sweetness, plus the crunchy tempura texture with the softness of the cooked apples and pancakes.... Literally my mouth is watering just thinking about it again. 

All of their menu options sound delicious and my sister's mushroom Benedict was also amazing. It is definitely pricier than most of the brunch spots I've been to but at least you leave with your tummy happy and your palette surprised and satisfied. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"So freaking good!!  We found this place on Yelp and we were not disappointed.  It's tucked away in a business complex but its ok. The food and staff were amazing.  There was a lot to choose from since the menu had all my favorite meats and breakfasts.  We ended up ordering three plates between the two of us. Corned Beef Hash was a homemade and DELICIOUS.  Pork Belly Benedict was perfectly seasoned and super tender topped with a poached egg and that sauce!!  Shredded Beef Barbacoa Benedict... holy sh**. It was good.  It was stupid good! 
Everyone was so nice from the time we walked in till we left.  The chef came out of the kitchen and walked around to each table asking how everything was and I really appreciated that.  Nice gesture!  Madeline our server was so nice.  Gave us the perfect amount of service.. not too much and not too little.  Our entire experience here was excellent.  I highly recommend this place... in fact we already have before we even finished our breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was ok (even good if it had come out right or on time) service was the issue they brought out the wrong food items then took almost 40 minutes to correct it.  The service manger brought out our bill and said don't worry I took the items off your bill (she took the items we didn't order off our bill) I wouldn't expect to pay for things I didn't order or eat"}
{"text":"Great place with fantastic food.  We were able to take take advantage of their happy hour which made the experience even more enjoyable.  All the staff including the chef who visited our table, were attentive and very accommodating.  I would highly recommend you try this place and don't get discouraged trying to find it...a little hard to track down but worth the journey!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time on Father's Day at 10:30a. We ordered an omelette and some sort of breakfast special- certainly nothing out of the ordinary. After 85 minutes, we asked the waitress to cancel our order, as we hadn't yet been served. The  waitress was very apologetic and comped our bill (which was only coffee) and asked us to return for a complimentary meal in the future. Very disappointing experience indeed."}
{"text":"Very innovative and flavorful cuisine. Laid back friendly great service. Love the place."}
{"text":"Owner is great and checks up on you. great food! big portions! fancy place. makes you feel like you're eating gourmet, but at a great price!"}
{"text":"So so so delicious!! I had the BAM Slam and my husband has the Tocilog breakfast. I asked to sub blueberry pancakes for regular, there was a $2 up charge, but it was 100? worth it. They were seriously some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The garlic rice from the Tocilog was AMAZING! Also, my bacon was perfect! It had some kind of sticky, yummy something on it, maybe syrup? I don't know, just delicious. So all in all, don't go here because I don't want to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Thank God for Yelp or we never would have found this place.  It's in an office complex you wouldn't see from the street. 

Very unique and eclectic menu with an Asian flare. They have a few different types of eggs benedict. We had the soft shell crab benedict. I don't usually don't go for hollandaise sauce but theirs is light and tasty.  They have also have a huge lunch menu which I'm anxious to try the next time we come back. 

Service was impeccable and personal and the chef checks in with every table.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This was a spot that my friend and I had been wanting to try post-yoga session. It's Asian fusion with a very hipster flare, serving many of their dishes on slate with decorative edible flowers, presentation is their strong suit here. The restaurant itself is small but reasonable since it's a modern breakfast/brunch joint. Service was great, the waitress gave us good recommendations, water was filled quickly, and we were given complimentary chips/salsa as a starter. As for food, I got the soft shell crab benedict and my friend got  the corned beef hash...both were delicious! My benedict was somewhat deconstructed (purposefully) and because of that, it looked beautiful. The only complaint that I have for this place is that it is a little bit pricey (most dishes are $12-20), but if I am ever in Henderson again, I would love to come here again to try the other delicious dishes."}
{"text":"Great service! The food was absolutely amazing. It is a most exquisite experience for the taste buds. The menu is a fresh and inviting take on the foods we love already. I will be back again and again. My complements to chef Matt."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Great little place for breakfast and lunch. A must stopover when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Always is super slow when I tend to come in, fresh soda out of a can, GREAT customer service. Love it!"}
{"text":"We were in search of a new brunch spot that would tickle our fancies. After a few minutes of Yelp searching we came across SERVED, and had a seat.  The initial thoughts were a very cozy, mom & pop spot with great decorum.  We were greeted by Cassandra as we walked in the door and took in the ambiance.  We ordered the Turkey Burger (add bacon) the crispy tacos, sweet potato fries, a Wailua Wheat and a Mimosa.  The drinks arrived promptly and the food shortly thereafter.

The turkey burger was immense!  The added bacon is a must have for anyone, and the side of crispy potato nuggets were amazing.  My Crispy tacos had just the right amount of sauce and slaw.  As for the sweet potato fries, huge portion, and absolutely delectable.

The Beer and Mimosas were spot on and Cassandra was ready for us when we needed more.  I'm extremely happy with our choice of brunch spots today.  Be advised, we came in on a Monday and were seated immediately.  I've heard weekends can get VERY busy, so be prepared!

All in all I'd have to give this place a 5/5.  Absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, hole in the wall! 
You walk in and it feels quite homey yet not too casual. I don't know why but it reminds me of some nice restaurants in the Philippines, could be the decorations but soon as I walked in, that's what I felt haha. Anyways, the staff is very kind! They are also big on customer service. Everyone made sure my family was satisfied at all times. It was really appreciated because there were a lot of us and it is a small restaurant so I could see how serving us would be hard or take time, but the servers were still very attentive. 
The food was delicious! Though I had pain in my teeth (from personal problems), I could still taste the flavors of the food. My sister and I got the shrimp tempura sandwich and pork belly burger and shared it. 
When it comes to tempura, you don't want it to feel heavy since its fried and you can tell if it's been cooked in old oil. This tempura was nice and light! Super yummy! With the bread and sauce on top, it was definitely something new and satisfying. 
The burger was just super meaty and delicious. A good burger alone is one thing, but pork belly too?! YUM! Also, I'm usually a fan of regular fries but the sweet potato fries here are so tasty I'd probably pick them as the side everytime. 
Anyways, I will definitely be back to try something new!"}
{"text":"Party of 3 ordered the fish tacos, pork belly banh mi, corn beef hash Benedict, and bam ham. Everything was delicious, esp the pork belly banh mi. It's tender and juicy and the baguette was nicely toasted. Love the crispy fish taco too. Their compliment chips and salsa were fresh and super good and crispy. Service was excellent. Our waitress did a great job checking up on us and serving us. I really want other food options too but I'm too full. Next time i visit i will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time here and i would like to say the place is very nice, welcome by a staff .. so i ordered the korean tacos .. i dont like beans and my bf got the korean plate we switch i wanted his salad and he can have my beans .. the salad has that strong dressing that you could actually feel the itch on my tongue .. my bf tasted the beans he told it was plain .. i like the tacos i would way its good, its tasty but since i paid for a drink .. the server didnt ask if i wanted a refill or something .. idk if theres a refill tho hahah but well still tho .. that chef idk his name but he ask us hows the food but we just both lied and we just said its good .. and the beginning the server gave us a chips and salsa .. it was alright .. it was still taste plain .. oh well .."}
{"text":"The miso burger was hands down one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I can't tell you what was better the food or the customer service because both were exceptional.  Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Got here totally by accident while I was looking for a brunch place around the Henderson area. 

At first sight the menu looks quite random, and because I didn't even look at the menu or photos before coming in I had no idea what to expect. 

It is a 3.5 stars spot for brunch, but  I gave them 4 stars and that is why:

* Service- professional, quick, to the point and very helpful. The hostess and waitress both were friendly and smiley just at the right amount. At one pitch not the chef/owner (not sure what was his position) came to check up on me- that was definitely a cool thing. 

* Food- it was good! Not the best Salmon Eggs Benedict, but still pretty tasty. 
The crispy potatoes were amazing! 

* Presentation- The dish looked beautiful! The use very unique plates and presentation looks beautiful. One thing I didn't like as much were the petals. I Just don't think there is a need for that. 

* Yelp Coupon- that was a nice surprise to get 15% off just to check in. I didn't even realize that after I already checked in. 

Couple of things that I DIDN'T appreciate:

* Ambient- definitely lacking something and I would even say boring. 

* Odor- unfortunately I must say that the place had a funky smell when you walk inside. Luckily for me I don't care much, and usually I'll get used to it pretty fast but there was definitely a funky smell that I didn't appreciate when I walked in. 

* Price- I think it's a little bit overpriced. But I guess you have to pay for that presentation!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous local place. And they stay open for dinner too!  The menu is full of gourmet and traditional offerings, all freshly prepared and delicious. The chef is usually on site fixing your meal and I have never had to wait for a seat. I will be returning over and over to eat here."}
{"text":"Got Served the best burger I have ever had. Came here with a colleague with for lunch during a business trip to Vegas and me being me had to Yelp the best restaurants for lunch before picking a spot. Served came up top so we went with that. 

Upon entering the restaurant it was shocking. Place was absolutely deserted, literally no one. Shocked we still decided to sit down and give the spot a try. A very nice hostess came over and took out order and dropped off some spiced chips and salsa. From the chips and salsa both my colleague and I both knew this was going to be a special lunch. We both couldn't stop eating the chips they were that delicious. 

For entree my colleague ordered their club (against my advise) with sweet potato fries and I went with their BBQ Bacon Burger with potato wedges. His club was good but nothing special but my Burger my god was that delicious. Perfectly cooked, quality bacon, and on a solid bun. 

Overall, this has easily beat Midtown Eats in Reno for me (since they removed the Bison Burger off their menu) for my favorite burger. Delicious. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Brought my daughter and a friend here for dinner.  The restaurant wasn't busy so my daughter charmed the server, who charmed the kitchen, into making blueberry pancakes.  They were delicious and perfect.  I had pork belly miso burger.  It was awesome.  Only plan on eating half.  Our friend had the Asian BLAT which was also perfect.  Great experience.  I'll come again with my wife."}
{"text":"We found this place from reading Yelp. Ohhh my!! What a find!!! I wish we lived here to come every week...maybe every day...Truly one of the most unique ways of cooking food. The bacon had a smokey, maple glazed flavor that was out of this world!!! Everything we ate had such an incredible flavor...will definitely spread the word to family who lives here, and come back when we visit. WOW!!!"}
{"text":"I purchased their signature burger.  This burger was amazing.  There is absolute passion put into every plate.

We were here on a business trip and found this gem on yelp.

We wanted something local and unique and that's exactly what we found.  I had trouble deciding what to get with such a powerful menu."}
{"text":"Really nice little restaurant located on Horizon Ridge in between Green Valley and Valle Verde in Henderson. Food was great and so was the service. The waitresses were very nice, fast, and attentive with great recommendations. To top it off Chef Matt stopped by our table to see how everything was which to me shows they care much about their business to personally check on their customers for feedback.

Cinnamon sugar chips with banana Nutella dip - very good. It was like a fresh made Cinnamon Toast Crunch but way better 

Longsilog - Good. Could use a touch of salt for my taste but the pickles on the side went well with it 

Soft Shell Crab Eggs Benedict - Amazeballs! Everything was perfectly seasoned. Loved it. Next time I would ask for a little more hollandaise to maybe dip my crab in and mix with my yolk

Side of Green Eggs - Yum! Eggs with a green Thai butter was delicious. Had is nice little kick to it"}
{"text":"A perfect example of Vegas' neighborhood eatery.  Small, welcoming, friendly, serving food with attitude.

What do Korean, Filipino, Peruvian and down home American food have in common?  NOTHING.  Except that they are all on the same menu at Served.
 
Not to fear, non-American dishes are not 100 percent authentic but represent well.  They are all boldly flavored with no regard if they pair with one another or not.  With their large portions, there is very little chance you'll be ordering two mains at the same time.

Note:  Breakfast review (the full starters and lunch specials menu is also available).

The comp, crispy cinnamon dusted flour tortilla chips are crack in a basket and a great way to whet the palate.

As a starter, the loaded truffle parm nuggets with roasted wild mushrooms is solid and actually as advertised.  Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside Yukon gold wedges, and a plethora of meaty, well seasoned wild mushrooms dressed with real truffle oil and a load of parm.  A handful of vegetal micro greens adds freshness.  Good eats.

For mains, it's all about the bennies.  All showcase a well made hollandaise with just the right touch of tarragon vinegar and beautiful, soft poached eggs with perfectly fluffy whites.  The base differs to best suit the dish.  All just work once the egg yolk is burst and mixed with everything.  For example, the \"Turf Side\" with sliced filet, aggressively seasoned, EVOO coated, roasted mushrooms, on grilled sourdough; burst the yolks, mix it up, the flavors blend beautifully.  The same is true for the \"Korean Spicy Pork\".  Juicy, spicy, slightly sweet, well marinated pieces of grilled pork atop crisp shrimp rice balls.  Again, burst the yolk for creamy richness that reduces the spice and blends it well with the seafood.  Micro greens garnish all dishes not only making them look good but to add freshness.  

Tip:  Wednesday is Industry Day.  Check with the servers for rotating specials.

Limited list of libations including a bottomless mimosa (orange or guava) option.

Vegas style start to the day done right."}
{"text":"Wow!! One of the best breakfast dishes I ever had. I had the Apple Tempura pancakes and coffee. This dish is to die for. Very decadent but so worth it. I was full until dinner after a 7:30AM breakfast which is not like me. LOL. Also very good coffee. I will be back soon. I look forward to trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"On top of great service & food, you get a nice 25% on your order if you show your server your service industry card (casino id, health card, tam card etc) on Wednesdays.  The menu is full of fun and delicious food, can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Idk why I didn't start my review earlier if this place because SERVICE was PHENOMENAL and FOOD was so flippin' AMAZING and DELICIOUS. I have to say I wasn't expecting too much since the place is pretty hidden from street view and relatively small and seriously empty when we got there. But it BLEW ME AWAY!! 

Now I forgot our server's name since time passed; but phenomenal service. He was so down to earth, great with giving us suggestions. And totally understandable of our two little ones. He brought out kids cups, extra plates and napkins without us even asking. He even brought my two year old fresh home made cinnamon chips with some bomb Nutella whip sauce to go with it. My kid went crazy over it! My inner kid secretly did too. Haha. 

Loaded Potato Nuggets- bomb appetizer. The potato nuggets were nice toasty fried oozing with the toppings. The bacon bits added a nice touch. I recommend sharing between more than two people because I was getting full just from this. It's pretty fried and heavy. 
BiBimBop- huge serving and so much galbi! So tender; so delicious. I'm salivating just thinking about it. And the use of colored carrots - nice touch
Miso pork belly burger - I can't say much about this, but my husband couldn't stop raving about his burger to me. But his tempura sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious. 

I'm going to have to come back and try their brunch and the rest of the menu. The food is pretty pricey, but definitely worth it. If you are ever in the area, there are tons of parking. It looks like a small cafe, but man does the food pack a punch full of flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fantastic service. I cannot day enough good things about our dinner there. We are excited to try their brunch sometime."}
{"text":"First time dining here, found it on Yelp as a recommended restaurant. The host was super friendly got seated right away. The restaurant was about 75% full but it wasn't quite 12 noon. We ordered the potato mushroom parmesen nuggets to start and we each order an eggs Benedict, one ribeye and one spicy pork. We changed from the crab to the spicy pork. The potato appetizer was amazing. It was very flavorful and were impressed. When we got our entrees one order was wrong the gave us the spicy pork and the crab not the ribeye. We kept it but were disappointed they didn't offer anything off the menu price since they messed up the order. The entrees were good and had a nice presentation."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp. Glad we tried it out. The food was so delicious. They give you fresh tortilla chips and salsa. The tortilla chips are amazing. Tasted fresh and the seasoning is great. Would be happy with just a basket of those...or bowl...or huge container lol. I ordered the pupusa. Oh wow! I've never had one before and these were amazing. Topped with braised beef, slaw and over easy eggs. It was delicious. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito. Huge burrito, only ate half. His only critic was the contents weren't mixed so some bites were just egg and tortilla. Otherwise he enjoyed it. We also got a side order of crispy potatoe nuggets based on the pics on here. So worth it. They're like breakfast potatoes/home fries but way better. They are crispy and delicious. Not overly cooked but a nice crunch on the outside and the inside is still soft. Definitely order those. 

The chef/ owner even came out and asked how the food was. We didn't realize it when he came out he was the owner too. Hope this place does great bc the food is really great and the prices aren't bad. 
Good luck Served!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal we have eaten in a long time. You could tell the chef took a lot of time in creating each dish.  The presentation was attractive and the flavors were delicious.  With great service, excellent food and generous portions we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a pleasant surprise! My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday at lunch time and we were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress was nice and gave us 2 chips & salsas. Not sure what they put on their chips, but they were yummy and fresh!
I ordered the Korean galbi flank steak tacos, which came with rice and beans. The tacos were delicious, the meat was well marinated and the kimchi slaw added the perfect touch! The rice that it came with was a bit crunchy for my liking, but had a good spicy kick to it. 
My boyfriend ordered the miso pork belly burger. It was huge! The pork belly was an added touch to an already good burger. 
This is defiantly a place I would visit again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten three times at Served, an Asian fusion restaurant, and each time it's clear that this is the food of a gifted, creative chef who clearly invests his love of cooking in his food.  

I've had the short rib chili cheese burger, the truffle mushroom burger, and the miso pork belly burger. Each one was fantastic, my only quibble was that the short rib was a tad dry, and my palate is too domesticated for wild mushrooms, but nevertheless I inhaled both burgers rapidly. 

The miso burger is sheer perfection, the substantial handmade patty and the marinated pork belly are a sumptuous combination. I've had pork belly burgers where the pork distracts from the beef, but this burger is a harmonious guilty pleasure. 

The service was at a high level, it was quick, considerate, and responsive. My coffee and water were quickly refilled. Simply a great meal."}
{"text":"Nice new place to go to for a weekend brunch.  Ordered the Bibim Ba and it was a pretty good size serving. I'm a big fan of locally owned businesses and would most definitely come back here to try out their other dishes. Matt, the owner/chef came out and greeted us to make sure that everything is good which is a plus"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Served has a lot of potential!
The delicious food was overshadowed by the subpar service.
With a name like \"Served\" you would think they would be stellar in that area.
My wife's omelette with home fried potatoes on the side was a 10/10
Unfortunately my Benedict didn't come out for over 10 minutes after her dish. 
The home fries had onions and I think bacon mixed in them. They were nice and crispy.
My Beef Birria Benedict was outstanding!

To make up for the delay on my entree, the Chef/ Owner gave me a cremation brûlée, which was a kind gesture.

I would love to see this restaurant be successful!

Note to the owner: you have the food part down!
Now create an atmosphere and level of service to go with it!
More upbeat interaction with your guest from all of the staff.
The servers should be asking questions and making suggestions on what to order."}
{"text":"Had our neighborhood breakfast group this month at SERVED. Our party of eight got excellent service by Linda and the food came timely and hot. With eggs cooked to specification and raves about the portions and in particular the pancakes and the CB hash. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo DELICIOUS!! I'm so happy I stopped in. 
Lots of yummy choices, but we chose to share the Birria Benny If you LOVE VISIONARY COMBINATIONS, you will LOVE this place. Chef Matt, was so sweet & came to make sure his creation was up to our expectations. He hit above the mark on this dish"}
{"text":"Served has been on my \"we really need to go there sometime\" list for a while. Finally, I resisted the urge to go to Kitchen Table and went to Served, which is practically next door. 
Very impressed, and I'm a harsh judge when it comes to breakfast. I thought their menu was very creative and the execution was spot-on. 
If I'm looking for a slightly-different selection of breakfast offerings (you won't find much in the way of \"normal\" breakfast here), this has now joined my shortlist."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast restaurant , beautiful presentation and the food is soooo tasty. Worth going to.. now a favorite place to start the day ."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to try the food because the hostess did not make me feel welcome. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was so amazing!! It's Hawaiian-Asian American fusion. Lots of Pacific Island flavors. We had a Benny and some tacos, both of which were exploding with flavors. Great, friendly staff that work really hard to create new fresh menus and they execute them beautifully! Fun, relaxing atmosphere too. We're from out of town, but really wish there was something like Served where we live. We'd go there all the time if there was :D"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Crispy Baked Berry French Toast, Parfait Pancakes, Apple Pie Tempura Pancakes, Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict, Corned Beef Hash Taco, Shrimp Tempura Taco, Longanisa Taco, Wellington Burger, Kabocha Curry, Asian BLAT.

Previously quite fond of Kitchen Table during Antonio Nunez tenure, the website now basically a wasteland and infrequent tweets of new plates from Javier nowhere near as exciting as the items created over a year ago, it was largely a matter of the similar location and aged reports that the menu was \"all over the place\" that prevented a visit to Served from Chef Matthew Meyer until Saturday morning.

Operating under the idea of \"Cultural Favorites Redefined,\" and featuring the skills of a Cordon Bleu trained Chef and owner of Matteo's Gourmet Food Catering and Personal Chef Services, Served is hidden in a small mall directly adjacent to the one containing its aforementioned competition and with a long, narrow dining space with humble décor plus medium-level rock music the space itself is clean and pleasant, a few paintings placed for color with textured white surfaces, Roman blinds and comfortable wood chairs accommodating perhaps fifty persons.

Told that the Chef's menu had recently turned a corner, the vast array of influences and techniques admittedly a source of worry on any menu if the strength of the kitchen is in question, it was with a brief e-mail sent to Matthew that the Chef agreed to size-down several plates into a make-shift Breakfast Tasting Menu at a fixed cost, all but one of the ten dishes tasted setting a high standard for the genre.

Featuring only one waitress on this particular day, no other patrons yet present at 7:30am but several tables sitting down around eight with two large parties slated to arrive around ten o'clock, it was with a glass of water poured as music played that Chef Meyer presented the first dish, Served's frequently Instagramed 'Crispy Baked Berry French Toast' that sees housemade Bread first baked, then soaked in custard and then Deep Fried with a golden exterior that crackles and gives way to semi-solid sweetness nicely paired to reduced Berries and sliced Almonds plus gentle hint of Bourbon.

Continuing sweet with two styles of Pancakes, the texture perhaps a bit compromised by the size as they did not look as fluffy as the Buttermilk rounds displayed online, Matt's new Parfait Pancakes were largely a combination of two menu items including a side dish made from Greek Yogurt and Honey Granola plus Berries while the \"Apple Pie Tempura\" style was far more impressive, the combination of skin-on diced Apples sauteed in Butter and battered slices a great one-two punch of texture amidst Brown Sugar, Cinnamon and Walnuts that likened a Praline in flavor.

Informed that full-sized portions are substantially larger than what was being served, the Marble Rye Bread Pudding base of \"Corned Beef Bread Pudding Benedict\" quoted at a pound itself, those who enjoy the flavor of the Cured St. Patrick's Day classic will be happy to know that Served's is both moist and robustly flavored, whether beneath a ladle of housemade Hollandaise alongside crave-worthy Breakfast Potatoes or atop double Tortillas as one of the menu's many styles of Street Tacos.

At first remorseful that a full order of French Toast had not been requested, but quickly realizing that the number of 'small' plates was still going to be quite a bit of food, two more Tacos were served next with both the overloaded Shrimp Tempura and Filipino Sausage even more impressive than the Beef, the former nicely balanced by acid and umami from slaw and sauce, respectively, while the latter trended a bit more sweet thanks to the Sugar Cane and Papaya.

Impressed enough by the Beans and Rice that 2 out of 3 servings were consumed, it was by way of a specially made Slider Bun that one of Meyer's Burgers was plated in a portion that was still quite substantial, the Medium-Rare Angus with a smooth grind topped with woody Mushrooms, Swiss plus the characteristic sapor of Duck Liver and a lightly cooked Egg every bit as rich as the ingredients would dictate, and in its full-sized portion undoubtedly more than a full meal for most.

Rounding out the morning with two more plates, a small corner of the Asian BLAT speaking volumes about the sourcing at Served as each Organic ingredient rang through, those looking for a touch of heat - or a completely Vegetarian selection - would be well advised to take a look at the lightly battered Kabocha Curry that features the sweet Gourd complimented by Bell Peppers and Spinach atop Rice with just a hint of Garlic in a vibrant and creamy Red Curry Sauce.

****1/2 - Making its way in a city of Public Relations Firms and 'Spin' on the back of little more than the Chef's skills and the quality of his ingredients Served is held back only by its location and the what the local market dictates."}
{"text":"We enjoyed brunch today. We all tried each other's food and liked everything we ordered. I am full in the best possible way. The avocado pancakes had a unique and awesome flavor. The choice of eggs benedict makes it hard to decide because they all sound so good. The kids french toast beautiful and tasted as good as it looked. A must try!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the great reviews, our group decided to come here for lunch. Their dishes have Filipino, Vietnamese, Japanese, Hawaiian and Latino influences. The pictures seemed promising but unfortunately, the food did not taste as good as it looked in the photos.

Pupusa:
Beef pupusa served with fried bananas, cabbage slaw and egg. Nice flavor and texture profiles. Savory beef, sweet bananas, and tangy slaw. 4/5

Beef Kalbi Taco:
Extremely salty. I couldn't taste anything else. 1/5

Crispy Pork Belly Taco:
I was excited to try this. The flavor was alright. Slightly salty and tangy. However, the pork was not crispy at all. 2/5

Miso Pork Belly Burger:
Thick slices of pork belly on a yummy burger. This burger is nice and thick...so, open wide! 4/5

Pork Belly Banh Mi:
Served with potatoes. The taste was quite forgettable though. 3/5

Service was great. It's just that the food wasn't as great as what people have been saying."}
{"text":"A pretty small place with one hostess and two servers.

We were able to sit quite fast, but the service was so slow. We saw two tables being neglected while we were waiting for our table. 

After we sat at the table, we waited about 10 minutes. One server took the table who sat after ours first. She didn't acknowledge that she would be with us shortly or anything like that, even after I made eye contact with her. 

There's obviously a lack of communication with the hostess and the servers of which tables to take orders first. 

At that point, our food was going to take too long to get so we left. Very disappointed because I really wanted to try their food."}
{"text":"Served is hidden in the strip mall next to gv chiropractic.  Small and quaint.  Chef is very nice and came out and greeted us.  Ordered his signature bi bim bap.  Meat was tender and juicy.  The Kim chee was sour and spicy.  Veggies were al dente.    I love to support small local businesses and would I've to see his business flourish.   I used to dine here when it was called intimate by the late chef don.  He would be proud."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, had the corned beef hash, real corned beef, crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"Dinner is amazing!!! Breakfast is good but dinner is amazing. The steak and the salmon were cooked to perfection.  I can't wait to try other things on the menu. 

Chef owned and operated. He uses fresh boutique quality ingredients."}
{"text":"OH MAN!!! Having eaten breakfast at Parker House, Boston (Parker House rolls); Lou Mitchell's, Chicago; Jazz Brunch at Stein-Erickson Lodge in Park City, Utah; and a few truly wonderful breakfast, Served is a MUST. Everything is scratch/house made. First bite of the corned beef, I knew it wasn't commercial. Matthew, the owner/evil genius, came out to say hello after we raved to our waitress... I asked if the beef was indeed house made and he, somewhat surprised \"average customer\", was happy to tell me all about it. Eggs were perfectly poached, scratch made taters, lovely house hollandaise (with just a tick of cayenne), and the \"marble rye bread pudding\" is really hard to describe, but savory and sensational. Extreme portions. Only thing Louise and I casually mentioned in the car to one another, as we headed back to the highway, was that the carpeted floor was kinda \"shot\". Not stinky, just past its \"best before date\". We both ALSO noticed that management was poring over flooring catalogs with floor installers while we leaving!!! So, no fault there... I have to give them 100/100. Also VERY good and very strong coffee. NEVER met a restauranteur as proud of his place and so attentive to his fare and his clientele. Trying to figure out our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"This was a cool little place. The menu was really interesting. It was the first day, so you could tell there was a nervous energy, but it really calmed throughout the service. The food came out with great presentation, and was delicious. The baked berry French toast was my favorite."}
{"text":"Very good food! Stumbled across on accident and glad we did. Lots of unique items to try and all were good. Love the added personal concern of the chef coming out to make sure we were good and thank us for coming in. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Must go here! Awesome food and Matt is an incredible Chef! I cannot say enough! I will follow him anywhere he goes"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant featured on a local news program and since it was in the neighborhood decided to check it out. First it is difficult to find. It is located in the center of a medical office building center not visible from the street. The GPS said we had arrived so I pulled into the complex and there it was. Parking was adequate but the owner should work with the complex management to get a handicap parking space or two closer to his restaurant. The closest handicap parking spot was in front of a Chiropractor's office quite a distance away. Once inside I found it to be smaller than I expected. Maybe it could sit 30 people max. I did not understand the décor. I suppose it was supposed to be cozy. As for the food choices I have been based in both the Philippines and Hawaii and have traveled all over Asia so was familiar with the menu items although the Chef had his own style dishes. We started off the juice of the day and coffee. I must say this was one of the best coffees I have ever had. I asked our server, Linda, what kind of coffee they served and she said all she knew it was strong. I expected her to say she would ask but she didn't. We ordered our brunch items starting with the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict for me and the wife had the Filipino breakfast. There was a long wait for the food to come. After 15 minutes or so Linda brought some chips and salsa to hold us over while I had my second cup of the excellent coffee. Finally the meals came. The Filipino breakfast was just right with the eggs whites crispy right along the edge the way they are supposed to be. You don't see that detail at most other Filipino restaurants. The Longanisa (Filipino sausage) was just right for me, not too garlic strong as some Filipinos like it. Notably missing were the traditional tomato slices normally served with the typical Filipino Breakfast plate. I like to mix the tomato slices with the garlic fried rice. I found the Roasted Pork Belly Benedict somewhat lacking. They were a little skimpy on the pork belly and it was not crispy along the edges as I expected. Rather just a little mushy. As someone mentioned in another review the bread was hard. If you like this type of dish I would highly recommend the Kailua Pig Benedict at Babystacks. In fact I would recommend Babystacks way over Served for menu selections (many more selections) and taste for this type of food selections. Lastly we ordered the Berry Baked French Toast for a sort of desert and to take home for later after tasting. It was stated on the T.V. review takes two days to prepare this dish. It is made from bread pudding cut into squares and fried as French toast. To me it was a big disappointment. It was served on a long plate as small squares. But as you removed what was supposed to be slices of French toast they fell apart and what you got on your plate was a pile of bread pudding with berries. Again, Babystacks far exceeds Served for this type of dish. I would maybe return to try other menu selections but for now prefer Babystacks for more selections at a lower cost. Another overlooked spot for Filipino-Hawaiian dishes is Thelma's Filipino Foods in Henderson. More of a point-point fast food place but excellent authentic Filipino-Hawaiian dishes."}
{"text":"It was so hard to choose a dish from the menu because everything sounded so good. My wife had the humongous burger with pork belly and I had a Peruvian dish that were both amazing! Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Served is a great place that I found on Yelp. It was kind of hard to find, but it's in the same place as Kitchen Table. 

Troi was great at explaining the highlights on the menu. He was very detailed and open to explaining great menu items. 

We ordered the portobello Benny, longsilog- Filipino flavors, chicken tacos, & apple pie tempura pancakes (PICTURE WORTHY)

Compliments to the personal delivery from chef Matt!

{"text":"Another successful Saturday brunch ! This place feels like you're walking into somebody's living room .. which is not a bad thing because the staff makes you feel so welcomed the moment you walk in. They were all very nice and inviting . You could tell they had a lot of regulars.
I had a coffee, my girl wanted a cappuccino but they don't have a machine for that ... at first that was a little annoying but the guava juice they brought more than made up for it. They also brought out house made chips with salsa , meant to help you pass time but it wasn't much wait to be honest, we took more time trying to figure out what to eat than them taking time making it ! Everything looks good on that menu!! 
We finally decided on the Wellington burger and the short rib Benedict , maaaan that was amazing !! The mix of flavors and tastes were out of this world ! And to top it all of , Chef Matt Meyers came out himself to check if our food was to our liking, and even chatted with us about the mushrooms and different flavors he uses !! 
Hats down to this place ! 
We'll come back again and again and we'll tell Everybody about ! 
Our contribution again to small business Saturday !"}
{"text":"Served is a clean, well maintained, cute little restaurant on Horizon Ridge. Our waitress was very friendly and very patient with me as I took forever to pick something out of their very creative menu. Everything looked so delicious. Sadly due to dietary reasons I picked the happy hour ono wings which was $5  (our waitress said it comes with 3-4 wings,we only got 3 per order). 
My wife ordered shrimp tempura taco for $3 and the Miso pork belly slider for $5. Both were on the happy hour menu. For the kids we ordered the kids fish sticks and the kids cheeseburger. Both come with a side and a drink, we chose sweet potato fries. 

 My wife liked the tempura taco and would order it again when she goes back. She also liked the miso pork belly slider but said she would try something different next time. 

The ono wings were ok. I was disappointed when they came out to see that they were covered in a sauce. The menu didn't say they came with sauce. I peeled off the skin to remove as much of the sauce as I could. They tasted good and I'm sure there are people that like it better than I do. The first batch of wings that I ordered came out as a mixture of wings and legs. The wings were cooked good but the legs were a little raw inside. It didn't bother me as I have a cast iron stomach so I ate them. I ordered another order of wings and asked for no sauce. They came out and looked good but when I picked up a wing I noticed that there was some sauce on the cabbage bed that the wing was sitting on. So I tasted it and sure enough there was sauce on it. I asked the waitress what kind of oil do they use to cook the wings in thinking that maybe they used some special oil. She said that they used canola oil. The wings in this order was cooked to perfection. 

The kids meals were good. The cheeseburger had good flavor and the fish was tasty. The sweet potato fries were cut nice and thin and seemed coated in flour with some seasoning before cooking. The natural flavor of the sweet potato fries shines through and they were delicious. 

Despite the issues we had with the wings we are excited to go back and try the other items on the menu that look so amazing."}
{"text":"HOLY SPAM GOD. Stopped in twice for a bite to eat. Once when we had a group of 11 and wild children running around. Thank goodness they knew to sit us in the back so the kids could continue to be little monsters while we ate in peace. I enjoyed the space of the restaurant and how the tables were situated. The length of the place created a consistent flow of air from entrance to exit that even being a bit warm, the fans kept everyone cool. Every meal that landed on our table was cooked to utter perfection. Both for the eyes and our mouths. First visit I ordered the green eggs and spam, with the the caption \"thai butter\" reeling me in. The thai spice added to the egg was beyond words. Matched with the garlic rice it was orgasmic. Just about everyone at the table ordered some form of pancake and their plates made my own mouth water. Second visit we went for burgers and fish tacos, both of which were complete perfection. Not sure I've tasted a better burger than my roomate's but theirs just oozed mouthwatering taste. Going to try getting through the menu--wish us luck!"}
{"text":"Two days in a row...delicious. First for lunch with my parents and next day breakfast with my boyfriend. You need to ask for Pupusas or the Salmon Panang one a little spicy but amazing. Breakfast a must the Huevos Rancheros. For the bacon lovers try Tempura Bacon Pancakes, first time ever eating Tempura Bacon. My boyfriend loved it."}
{"text":"The food was so great we wished we could of eaten every meal here, but don't have 4 stomachs. Excellent selection. Chef Matt/Joe added so much uniqueness to each and every meal. French Toast is right up there on top! So good. The turkey sandwich was so moist and awesome. It had a great taste because Chef brines the whole bird. You can't go wrong eating here. The fried potatoes (formally baked potatoes) were so crispy and light. Service was from Jamie took great care of us. Oh one other thing the coffee and the beans they used to make it was better than any coffee I have ever had. If I could give 6 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been in a situation where you wanted brunch, but didn't know where to go?  With 9.5 other people (one being a small child)?  All of different ethnicities and food tastes?  And with no reservations?  Well, I was in this situation last Saturday.  Thankfully, Served bailed me out and provided a wonderful brunch to this motley crew.

Even without reservations, the staff snuck us in and seated us pretty quickly.  While the majority of my party ordered regular \"American\" breakfast food, I could not pass up the longsilog, which came with 3 crispy-cooked links of Filipino sausage, pickled papaya, and garlic fried rice topped with 3 fried eggs, just like Mom used to make (if you grew up in a Filipino household).  

My brother-in-law did get the soft shell crab benedict, which he \"crushed,\" leaving the plate clean.  Other offerings at the table included some huge omelets and a few orders of blueberry pancakes.  By the end of the meal, all of our plates were empty, but our bellies were full"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dying to try this place. So recently, we went on a Friday afternoon around noon. There were only a few tables sat. Very quiet. I wish I could rate the restaurant higher,  but for me, I feel like the reviews hyped it up and it definitely didn't hit the mark with me. I could be bias because I'm Filipino and have eaten at tons of Filipino restaurants. I expected more from this fusion.

The chips they gave to munch on were yummy.
They had no Filipino drinks, which I thought was strange since they have a few takes on Filipino dishes. They only had like apple juice or oj. Why not offer Calamansi or melon or coconut?!? 

Anyways, my husband ordered the langonisa burger which he gave 4 stars. It came with mac salad which I felt was bland and lacked any real flavor. He compared it to like a Hawaiian salad, and he even thought that Albertsons mac was better.

I ordered the pupusas with some kind of meat and cheese and honestly didn't taste like anything. The plantains were the best thing on the plate, fried and sweet. But when I sent it back for not tasting at all, they took it haha.

So then they apologized and asked me what else I would like. I tried the tocino take they had. It's not like your normal tocino. The \"tocino\" flavor was on fried pork belly, which consists of mostly just fat. It may have tastes better if it was crunchy. But it was literally all fat. I couldn't eat it either. The garlic rice was no good either. (Better at baby stacks or any Filipino buffet).

It just lacked any real taste. I also thought it was weird that the waitress didn't ask how the food was after the second plate was considering the first one was horrible. She prob thinks I'm a complainer lol but I just tell it like it tastes.

I won't return. But my husband might with some of his friends who've never had Filipino food lol. Price seems like it is at any other restaurant in the area, average of like 15 bucks a plate."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast and a great deal too. We had server all egg dishes, the Filipino breakfast (pictured) and the apple pancakes. All delicious."}

Friendly service and very accommodating!

{"text":"Passed by \"Served\" while waiting to get in at nearby Kitchen Table.   Turned out to be a great alternative tasty feast with a diverse cultural flare on traditional breakfast fare.  You won't be sorry giving this eatery a try for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"My boy loves the Filipino breakfast plate here and convinced me that BOTH of us should get the same thing.  Presentation was great; the sausages were delicious but I found the garlic rice just a tad bit too \"greasy\" and rich for me.  Will need to try the benni next time!"}
{"text":"A very unique brunch spot in the heart of green valley, the food was very well seasoned and had way more flavor than the average restaurant. The service was excellent, well mannered and attentive, the chef even came out to see how we enjoyed the food!  my only complaint would be they could be a little more vegetarian friendly, they only had dairy milk for the coffee. However I devoured my portabello benedict and will definitely make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"I order the pork belly entree and it was awesome. The pork belly paired great with the pineapple fried rice. My wife ordered the beef enchiladas and loved them. The enchiladas were a great mix of flavor with both red and green sauces served with garlic rice. Normally she gets cheese enchiladas, but said these were the best she's ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Found this joint after looking up best brunches in Henderson and man.. did they not disappoint. Their brunch was fantastic, service was tremendous, and the chef/owner even came out to check on all the tables. Definitely will be back and recommend to anyone looking for great local spot."}
{"text":"Excellent gourmet breakfast options.  The pancakes were excellent, the breakfast sandwich was cooked perfectly, and the cinnamon chips with banana Nutella an creative touch.  The French toast is made with bread pudding and is not traditional but was quite tasty. The portions are large and we took about half the meal home.  The price point is high for breakfast but excellent for sharing and the food quality is worth it."}
{"text":"I have nothing but praise for this local gem. I've tried both the Barbacoa Benedict and the Buso and both are layered with flavor. I've been back a few times and the only thing better than the food is the service and attention to detail in every aspect of the term. Even Chef comes out to see how everything is and if we need anything. I've been back a few times and will continue to do so knowing hospitality and guest service is highly a priority. Thanks Guys!!"}
{"text":"So glad we decided to check this place out. What an incredible menu and the food is fantastic. We tried the spinach salad and pork belly sandwich which was accompanied by a truffle potato crunch of goodness. Everything was very tasty and service was excellent. The chef even stopped by our table to make sure we were happy with our food. They made us feel welcomed and had a few laughs. Definitely will be back to try out more...thanks for a memorable meal!"}
{"text":"Served is a real Henderson gem.

I've been here twice now and both visits have featured food that was fabulous.  Both times I had the Ono Wings with rice because that dish is just delicious.  I am not really a wing woman, but I just love the seasoning they use, maybe soy?  I recommend this dish for yourself or to share if you're feeling generous.  My second visit was with the boyfriend for breakfast and I had the Longsilog (Filipino) breakfast, which was just like eating at my parents' house.  This dish features longanisa, garlic fried rice, and fried eggs, all of which are  regular features in Filipino households, or at least they are in ours, my aunts' and uncles', and cousins' kitchens.  Longanisa is a Filipino sausage that's on the sweeter side and is usually eaten with rice. Heck, most Filipino food is eaten with rice.  Although Served is not a Filipino restaurant per se, there is definitely a Filipino influence due to one of the chefs being married to a Filipina: he's a smart man.  I really loved this breakfast and of course I'm probably biased since it just brought back all the warm memories of home and Mom and Lola's cooking.  

The staff here is very welcoming and attentive and the overall experiences I've had here just make me want to return again and again.  Next on my list to try are the longanisa tacos, the Mac and Cheese of the Day, and the Miso Pork Belly Burger."}
{"text":"I noticed this place a couple weeks ago & checked out the menu that was on Yelp and today we decided to try it, not knowing it was opening day. And apparently it's 50% off thru Mother's Day! 

The service from Joe was great! Our food was delicious, especially the bacon which we found out from chef that he cooks it with brown sugar. Only negative thing was it took forever but worth the wait. They have a great menu selection so can't wait to try stuff on the lunch menu. 

The decor is nice but I think they should change the flooring. The carpet gives it a banquet hall feel."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in here with our toddler for dinner and it was delicious. We shared the shrimp tacos and the longaniza burger. Everything was very fresh. I loved the sauce on the tacos. With the burger, none of the flavors were overpowering and all blended together really well. The burger was cooked at a perfect medium. There wasn't much that we could give to the toddler, but I wouldn't hold that against anyone and they were really accommodating on finding something that he would eat, which ended being toast lol. The server was very friendly and attentive and even the chef came out to ask how it was. We would most definitely go again."}
{"text":"I ordered the omelet and opted for all vegetarian. This omelet had shallots, mushrooms and spinach. It had to be the freshest omelet I've had. The breakfast potatoes were perfection. My husband ordered the portobello Benedict and said he felt as we were out eating in Portland. The food served uses high quality ingredients. I have never had a breakfast like this in town before. Come to Served if you enjoy high end ingredients."}
{"text":"I took my Mom to breakfast at this hot new business yesterday morning and we had absolutely no regrets. It is located up off of Horizon Ridge Parkway in a nice new strip mall. It was pretty easy to find with ample parking. 

The restaurant itself is a small intimate setting. The tables are simple and modern and each table has a small succulent plant as the centerpiece. We arrived around 9:30am and there weren't too many people so it was very comfortable. We were greeted by our lovely hostess/server who promptly sat us at a table by a window and provided drinks instantly. The menu is very diverse offering meals from Mexico to the Phillipines. I chose the Huevos Rancheros and Mom chose the Bam Slam. 

When the breakfast arrived, it was hot and looked delicious. The Huevos Rancheros was served with three corn tortillas that were fried and sitting on a platter of Peruvian beans. Three eggs topped the tortillas and queso crema was the icing on this mountain of goodness. Along the sides of the dish was a layer of sweet, green salsa and then there was an inner layer of hot red salsa on the eggs and potatoes. The dish produced so many different flavors and textures. The Peruvian beans were a unique change for this dish as I have usually only had it with refried beans. The Bam Slam was huge and can easily feed two people. Eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast and Mom was very full by the time she was done. What I enjoyed most about this meal was the fact that Chef Matt came out and asked us how we liked our meals. He was very friendly and I appreciate when the chef wants to know your opinion. It tells me that he genuinely cares about the food he is creating and serving. 

There were so many interesting and tasty looking dishes on the menu to sample which gives me every reason to return in order to taste more breakfasts dishes and then lunch. They aren't open yet for dinner but they are planning on it in the future. By the time we were finished, the restaurant was getting busy which I believe was attributed to the flavorful food being cooked.

I suggest that when you are out in Green Valley, you stop by to be SERVED at this quaint little gem!"}
{"text":"We saw the review on yelp so we decided to try this restaurant. Being Filipino we were to excited to see Filipino breakfast items. My sister and I ordered the longsilog that was just ok, I had better longanisa. My other sister ordered the tapsilog which the tapa had more fats then meat. My husband ordered the turkey sandwich which the turkey was too dry but he liked the fried potato that came with it. We ordered the kids grilled cheese and chicken breast with rice, the grilled cheese had not enough cheese and the bread seems old then the  chicken breast was so dry and hard (left on the grill too long). We all have different taste buds so this restaurant might not pass our liking but it could for some of you."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, food and their selections on the menu. Highly recommend..But they do need more server to attend to their customers. Other than that everything is good. Will definitely come back and try their other dish.."}
{"text":"1st time here, it was awesome. We noticed the menu changes frequently from other reviews. Ordered a special lomo saltado and pupusas the taste was excellent."}
{"text":"I always get the corn beef and hash and it literally never disappoints. My spouse has explored the menu and had mixed reviews on some of the less popular dishes but I love the service and the food"}
{"text":"Our breakfast was delicious! The carne asada was seasoned perfectly. The potatoes were great. We also tried the bread pudding. A must! Great presentation and the sauce was to die for."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have thoroughly enjoyed every part! From the service to unique menu items, I can't wait to come back. Yes the decor is a bit blah inside, but I come to eat, not look at decor. The free chips and salsa is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and bland.  Found this place on yelp and am disappointed.  Be ready to spend more on eggs Benedict than you would at most brunch places on the strip.  Although we came at noon on a Sunday, the place was dead.  I can see why.  The servers were very helpful and the service from them was good.  Like the other yelpers posted, the owner/chef walks around to ask if the food is good or if we need anything else.  I replied, \"Actually, yes.  The eggs Benedict does not have much hollandaise sauce.  May I have a little more?\"  He said yes, disappeared in the kitchen, and never came out.  After 20 minutes, we finished and left.  Why bother asking if you're not gonna do it?  I ordered the soft shell crab benny. The crab was not seasoned and lost in a lot of batter. The hollandaise amounted to a little drip.  I could honestly not taste it. That's why I asked for more.  However, the eggs were poached perfectly.  Anyway, next time I'm in the mood for brunch, I'd rather go to Kitchen Table down the block, which has similar food and more flavor."}
{"text":"Eat here.  My wife and I came here for breakfast.  I ordered the crisp berry french toast and she ordered the corned beef hash benedict.  The food has a special combo that cannot be matched in Los Angeles.   Portions were excellent and not small at all.  If you live in the area, go there. It's amazing."}
{"text":"For first timers and our experience we will definitely be returning for seconds! Quality, creativeness, and presentation of food was intriguing to say the least! You can feel and see the pride the owner/chef has to his guests. He personally checked on us and every other table as well, you can tell he genuinely cares for you and his staff as he was hands on helping them clear/clean tables. (My small reason for 4 stars would be the decor but maybe that's just me being picky). We got SERVED and are happy we did!"}
{"text":"The place was not busy and the prices seemed high for breakfast and brunch


Per your comments...

I thought I was reviewing for Kitchen table which was 5 star. The food was great, the service was great, and the prices were good. 

To be honest, we went to your restaurant before and it had a sewer smell. We thought perhaps it was a one time issue. This was not the case...same smell. Plus the prices were high for what you get. 

I would much rather go to kitchen table next door. Even with a 10% discount I would not go back. Even with a free meal I would not go. You asked me to be honest...so here it is. Good luck."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Came for brunch. Got the mixed berry French toast and the corned beef eggs Benedict. Our server was super friendly and helpful, and the chef also came out to check in and make sure everything was ok. Would absolutely come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way home from Vegas, looking for something a little different to round out the trip. Best decision we could have made. Service was personal, friendly, and prompt. Thank you.  Best part however was the uniquely expressive fusion of traditional breakfast favorites with Asian influence. Great selection of food types, all familiar, but with something a little extra. Perfect balance of flavor.  It was like seeing a beloved family member after they returned from a long visit overseas, but they have returned with exciting new secrets."}
{"text":"What I liked:

1. Chef was going around tables asking for feedback. This guy cares, folks. 

2. Longsilog is clean, and by that I mean it's not overly seasoned. Garlic rice was just enough garlic, and the longanisa was juicy. 

3. Service by Jaime was great. Just attentive and proper. 


What can be improved:

1. Tocino was fatty, bit much for ethnic palette, so Western palette might get intimidated. But flavor was good over all. 

2. Plating of corned beef hash. While tasty needs some TLC. BUT still tasty. 

3. Restroom needs attention. 

4. Ambience. It's clean, but maybe some color.  I'm just being picky. 

--------------

Always for the chef trying to push, you can tell he's concerned and wants to be great. Great place overall and would come back. Don't hesitate, try it!"}
{"text":"The Service was good. I ordered the BamSlam. The pancakes were good, the potatoes tasted like they were reheated and the egg had a very strange case to them the chef was kind a messed to remake them for us however they still tasted weird we couldn't eat them. The bacon was good it was cut in some type of brown sugar"}
{"text":"Soft shell crab benedict!! Yummmm!!!
Love their experimental menu. I hope they can move to a new location with better ambiance, once their business takes off! Foodies must try!"}
{"text":"Thought I would update my review for Served since I've been back twice and WOW'd both times.
My first time back I had seen another patron with the baked berry French toast so I wanted it....badly. I tried to get it on Memorial Day but they were closed, so a week later I snuck away from work to devour this sweet and sexy meal. It did not disappoint. This might be the best french toast I've ever eaten in my life!! The toast itself had a crunchy outside with a soft middle, baked strawberries and blueberries all over it, lots of sliced almonds..and topped with a frangelico syrup. OMG! I will order this again and again and again. 

2nd trip back I brought a friend. He had a special Peruvian dish not on the menu whose name I'll never remember, and I had the Pork Belly Miso burger. Chef Matt explained that he liked this Peruvian dish so he tried to emulate it, and it came out great. See photos. I snuck a couple bites from my friend and it was delish! My Pork Belly Miso burger was HUGE and cooked to perfection. The pork belly taste was a little hidden by the beef flavor (I love the marinated pork belly here) and it was juicy and a bit messy to eat. I could only down 1/2 the burger along with the side of sweet potato fries. I loved the flavors.

I'll be back because I love this place and the menu has so many things I enjoy eating. Its going to be hard to try them all because of that baked berry French Toast though....I might be in love."}
{"text":"It was okay...it's a small location but it took a long time to get service and the food quality was also okay but a lot of batter on fried stuff. The sweet potato fries were also battered and fried. Not much flavor and kind of bland but had potential. It could have been just what we ordered but just not a great experience."}
{"text":"This place has amazing breakfast. Def recommend one of the eggs Benedict dishes. The coffee was nice and rich and I could only finish half my dish because I was so stuffed. Will go back for lunch!"}
{"text":"If you have not yet visited, then make it a point to do so.  It is a must for brunch on a Sunday or Saturday.  Portions are huge and delicious !  Incredibly family friendly. Casandra was our server and she was as sweet as the food was delicious. Chef and Owner Matt comes out and greets everybody in due course. He actually wants to know your thoughts about the food and service.  
We had the longonisa and potato's as a starter. We destroyed it. My miso pork belly burger was sooo big I couldn't finish it. The burger was 12 oz and there had to have been 6 oz of beautiful pork belly sitting atop it.  The white rice was not really good. The garlic taste was owed powering. Didn't care because I knew I wouldn't finish the burger anyway. Everyone that dined there thought it was terrific. Make sure you try anyone of their burgers. Huge hits out of the park."}
{"text":"this is a hidden gem! I had the crab cake Bennett it was excellent. My husband had an omelet and loved it. We were the only ones there which surprised and worried me. I guess people just don't know about it. The girl that greeted us and took our order was delightful."}
{"text":"Found on a whim while looking for a breakfast place.  We were greeted and sat immediately. We happen to get there the same day a new waitress started.  She was very nice and tried her best to keep up with the busy place.  We ordered: Tocilog (Filipino breakfast)
3 eggs, sweet cured pork, garlic friend rice, atchara (pickled papaya) & *Portobello Benedict
Marinated grilled portabella mushroom, roasted peppers, spinach, green onion, hollandaise, sourdough crostini w/breakfast potato. Both dishes were amazing!  Only downside was, they need more help (maybe a bus person) and it was very loud.  It's a small place, so the voices carry.  I couldn't hear my husband very well and I got the impression everyone else was the same way.  It seemed like everyone was talking loud to drown out the other person.  I will definitely be back, but not with a big party."}
{"text":"Food was cold and soggy 15 minutes late driver had no change!!!! Very disappointed wouldn't order delivery"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with friends! We have a great experienced food was excellent , service was outstanding the Menu was well selected very competitive in price.. Not a typical mom and pop breakfast.. It's elegantly presented and serve.. 
Recommend it for next breakfast place to go to.."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I usually come here for brunch. This place is never packed and I don't understand why. You can tell the chef cares about the food because he will come out and check up on each table to make sure everything's perfect. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nice little place with a lots of potential  nice decor very modern kinda hidden in the back .
Cheep wine bottles on display. Coke products by the can 
Some beer by the bottle .
Friendly service"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!!! This place is amazing and the food is great. Happy hour menu is awesome. Plenty of choices. Food is flavorful. Kudos to the chef! You need to try their bread pudding! Friendly staff, great environment."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience here, the food was so good and the staff was amazing. The customer service was great, everybody was so nice and i'll definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Wifey and I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out as it was close to our place in Henderson, NV. What a nice little brunch spot! we went on a Sunday morning around 10am and was seated immediately - not having to wait is always an added plus! We both had a Mimosa and enjoyed the breakfast items we ordered. The ambiance is pleasant and the overall dining experience was made better as we were greeted by surprise and \"SERVED\" by a friend of ours that I didn't know recently started working there. If you ever come to eat at Served, look for a fine young woman with sleeves tattoos on her left arm and a big beautiful smile - that's our friend Jean and she'll take good care of you!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It truly is a hidden gem! The service was great Troy had wonderful recommendations and to be honest they where all spot on and delicious! If your looking for a great brunch place with AMAZING FOOD, that isn't super crowded or over priced then this is the place! Honestly the food was incredible the service was wonderful. I will be back for sure and this coming from someone who works in customer service so you know it must be OUT OF THIS WORLD! Just go check it out!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found Served and stopped in for breakfast. Served is located at Horizon Ridge/Valle Verde in the back of the office complex. We arrived just after 9:00 and were the only two there until just before we left. The menu at Served is multi cultural with Filipino, Spanish and Asian influences. After seeing pictures of the berry french toast I had to order it! The food did not come out until about 9:35, almost 30 minutes after we ordered. It was far too long a wait for being the only two in the restaurant. 

Chef/owner Matt brought the food out and apologized for the wait. The berry french toast was nicely presented with berries, sliced almonds and whipped cream. As Matt explained, the french toast starts off as a bread pudding which makes it so delicious. 

He also uses several different types of bread which mixes up the flavors and textures. The side of potatoes we ordered were also fantastic. Nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The food was 5 stars. Matt came back to see how we liked it and explained his cooking style and made sure we were happy with the food. I will definitely be returning soon to try out his lunch items."}
{"text":"Incredible food with layers of flavor, inventive menu with good mix of traditional favorites and new concepts, and wonderful service...is there anything more to ask from a brunch?  

They really want you to enjoy yourself at Served.  The chef came by our table to check on our experience.  The front of house was very attentive despite the frantic pace he kept while servicing the room.

On the advice of our server, I had the soft-shell Benedict - a bright hollandaise drizzled across a crisp tempura-battered soft-shell crab and poached eggs with slightly spicy seasoning.  My husband indulged his Filipino side and had the tocilog and a side of span musubi.  He raved about the authenticity and quality of the food.

Do yourself a favor and go to Served ASAP!"}
{"text":"Everything was super delicious! Nice dining environment and excellent service! We like how they make the food look like a piece of art. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Service: 3/5
Food: 4.5/5

I actually enjoyed the food quality at Served. It also helps that the restaurant is a new and upcoming brunch place a few minutes from my house! Tucked away in a business office plaza, Served has two large banners that identifies the building from the outside. The inside decor wasn't too attractive and was a bit too dark. 

Upon entering, we had to wait a few minutes before the \"only waitress\" finished helping the other guests to get seated for a party of 5. The reason why I gave service 3/5 was because: 
1) there was one waitress for 10 tables 
2) the poor lady was overwhelmed and had a queue of service requests from all the patrons

We had to wait awhile before we even ordered our food. It was even more frustrating that a table or two got their food before us when we clearly got there first. Again, I totally don't blame her. The restaurant just needs to staff more waiters and waitresses at this place. She forgot things there and here, but I couldn't blame her. We got our free chips about 15 minutes after being seated. 10 tables to 1 waitress is insane.

As for the food --- oh boy! I loved it! I ordered the Bi Bim Ba. It was mhmmmm good! The meat was a slight tougher for my liking, but it was deliciously grilled and seasoned. I'm interested in trying the Miso Belly Sandwich next. My table shared the Baked Berry French Toast and it was sooo good! I highly reccomend this as a dessert to finish off any meal.

Overall, I'd reccomend giving this place another shot to see if the service gets better. For brunch, I highly reccomend coming here."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week. The food was fantastic! Great quality, great selection, diverse and interesting...the service was also great. The chef came out at the end of our meal to ask how everything was. The ONLY reason I am giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because the decor and ambience inside the restaurant is wayyy off point. Not to sound dramatic, but it's to the extent where we almost don't want to go back because it was so strange and in desperate need of a cohesive and comfortable atmosphere. 
All in all, it's new and will get there. The food and service are DEFINITELY worth it."}
{"text":"Tried out this new restaurant and boy, am I coming back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This is an amazingly delicious new restaurant that is excellent for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. The chef takes great care in presentation, fresh and quality ingredients, and taste that makes you crave more! We will definitely be back to try more of his creations!"}
