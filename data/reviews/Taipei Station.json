Ok this place is OUT! I went again as I was hoping they could make something right this time, but nope, the person in the kitchen is definitely not a chef as he has no sense of how to prepare decent food.

This time we ordered something totally different, my wife's minced meat rice came in such a small portion now I understand why some of the reviews complained about the size. 

My beef noodle soup, ugh... let's just say \"worst in town\" is an understatement, they simply don't know how to make it. Sure, the broth is supposed to be \"healthy\", so no MSG, low sodium and all, but it has no taste as well! I asked for something that I could add to the soup for more flavor, but was given a small bowl of soy sauce! Totally hopeless.

The waitress didn't understand the menu and every question asked was met with a slightly apologetic face and she had to run away to ask someone else for answer.

In short, DON'T waste your time!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing and I come here at least once a week. They have a lot of varieties of foods, drinks and desserts in their menu to choose from. What I like the most is their seafood noodle soup and Taiwanese rice in chicken soup. The portions are big enough to fill me and it tastes great. The owner is very nice, she always gives my friends and I some shaved ice and let me tell you it is amazing. It is different from the crushed ice you'd get at tea shop, this is truly worth trying. Now they have added all you can eat hot pot, all you can drink and all you can eat dessert. The prices are fair and my friends and I love going there for all you can eat! This restaurant is really not as bad as what the other review says. I suggest and recommend people to go there."}
{"text":"I realized in hindsight that I should've checked yelp reviews for this place before deciding to eat here. My family and I decided to give the place a shot thinking that we could get some quick service being some of the only patrons in the almost barren restaurant.

I think that some of the problems at this place stems from being understaffed in the kitchen. Some dishes were mediocre but others were just plain terrible. Considering the premium that you pay at this place in comparison to other restaurants in fmp, you would really expect a higher quality in the food. The popcorn chicken is a staple Taiwanese dish, but it is a little under seasoned and I've truthfully had much better at other Taiwanese restaurants in Markham. The Taiwanese chicken was the worst food that we ordered tonight... Its more like Taiwanese chicken bones. What small part of it that is actually chicken meat is kind of dry and basically the opposite of everything it's supposed to be.

What made the whole experience worse was the fact that all the food we ordered arrived within huge 10 to 15 minute gaps of one another. The first dishes that arrived were lukewarm by the time everything was on the table. 

All in all it was just a really subpar experience and a restaurant like this should really step up its game considering how many other feasible options are in the immediate vicinity!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. DO NOT go to this place. It seems like this place is family run and they don't know what they are doing at all. First, they sat us down and for 10 minutes, no one came over to give us menu or any drinks. We have to ask for it 2 times before they can locate a menu for us. We ordered the minced pork dry noodle and the Taiwanese style fired chicken noodle. The minced pork noodle came after 10 min and it looked so wrong. The noodle was so hard and oily that I can hardly eat it. The taiwanese style minced pork taste like pork mix with soy sauce and oil. Not authentic at all and my home make noodle tasted better then that. The only way I can finish it is mixing it with hot sauce. We waited for 15 min after ordering and we were still waiting for the fired chicken noodle so we followed up with the waiter but were told it was still being cook. Another 15 minute passed and I finished my noodle, the fried chicken noodle still have not come yet and was told by the waiter that it's coming soon again. We were in a rush and after 45 minute of waiting, we gave up and tell them to cancel the order and left.  Do yourself a favor and don't eat at this place. It's one of my worse dining out experience and do not recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible, I really don't think owner is Taiwanese, due to waitress doesn't understand what I'm asking for, and don't even bother to understand my question. 

With the coupon that we found online, there's always a catch, 75 cent extra for cold drink, 1 dollar extra for flavour?? By only asking how much is the extra flavour, waitress insist wants to know what flavor I want, therefore as I ask her are the price different for different flavor? I personally don't think she understand English well, due to she keeps on repeating NO tell me what do you want, so I can give you price! (really?) Later on Waitress interrupt me and my girl friend's conversation and tries to PROVE THE PRICE DIFFERENCE ON THE MENU while me and my girl friend are discussing what we want to get.  Simply RUDE, and no manner.  Just as we had enough of it and decide to leave, the waitress said it loudly behind our back, THEY ARE CRAZY! Excuse me?? That's customer service??? I'm sorry to say, but Taiwanese restaurant is always focus on customer service, this is just a Taiwanese restaurant want to be. Very very disappointing!

Guys, if you want Taiwanese food, check out Metro Square or else where, this place is no Taiwanese food what so ever."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS. I'm surprised this place is still open. 

The food portrayed as Taiwanese cuisine at Taipei Station is a disgrace to the Taiwanese culture. 

The tapioca in the bubble tea was way too soggy and the drink itself was too powdery (there were still clumps floating around). The fried noodles we ordered were soaked with soy sauce, yes SOY SAUCE. The noodles were what came out of instant noodle packages. It was so salty, I had to send it back to the kitchen, and they didn't even take it off my bill at the end. 

The bean curd appetizer was also very very very salty. I can't believe the owner had the confidence to even open a restaurant because I think even I cook better than whoever's using soy sauce as flavouring for everything.

Seriously, you've been warned. TERRIBLE service, TERRIBLE food. If you come here, please do not consider this Taiwanese food. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"already been to this restaurant couple times because it opens late and they have very unique choices of food. i really like their seafood Taiwanese noodle, their soup is not too salty, not one of those soup which makes you so thirsty for the rest of the night, the service is really good, and we never had to wait for long, very interesting choices of drinks that you wouldn't get at a regular restaurant, the environment is very warm and cozy, will for sure go back again."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for a week since it opened, and finally got to try it today!

Environment: Decor is modern with a cozy lounge atmosphere. You know it's new when you smell the fresh paint :) 

Menu: It has an extensive list of food, beverages, and desserts! Taiwanese cuisine is their specialty. Similar to Bubble Tea places (Destiny, Go For Tea, Sugar and TenRen). There's a section for lunch specials for those interested. There's so much I wanted to try.

Service: Friendly staff, good quick service. They explained the items on the menu. Checked on us when it was needed and gave us privacy when we wanted to be left alone (I'm sure you've been in a situation when the waiters, waitress, or hostess are intrusive).

What we ordered: Guava Slush, Mango Yogurt, Marinated Pork Feet, Fried Butter Melon, Slice Beef and Tendon Noodle Soup.

Guava Slush was tasty. The right amount of flavor and not over sweetened. My girlfriend loved it!

Mango Yogurt was good. Needed to be colder.

Marinated Pork Feet was flavorful and yummy! We love our PORK FEET =D Good size serving, and tasty. We were too full to finish the last taunting piece.

Fried Butter Melon was battered just right. Good amount of flavor, felt like I was eating chips. Was a suggestion made by our waitress.

Slice Beef and Tendon Noodle Soup was impressive. Why? Because the broth actually tasted like soup. Didn't taste like there were additives. We weren't thirsty afterwards (TIP: MSG makes you thirsty). Tendon and sliced beef was cooked just right. Beef came out medium with a little redness, which is a bonus because I hate overcooked beef. Tendon had the right texture. The noodles were ramen.

Overall: I think I found a new Bubble Tea replacement. It had great snacks, food, and drinks. Price was reasonable because everything came to $35 with Tax and Tip. The owner gave us a FREE shaved ice dessert! Probably due to its new opening or wanted our opinions because the waitress asked us how it was. We ordered Taro Shaved Ice (came with popping bubbles). It was delicious! We've noticed right away, that it wasn't too sweet and had just the right flavor. The waitress said it was natural with no additives. The shaved ice was slightly different than I expected. Not shaved ice with syrup on top, but rather flavored and them shaved?"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. Didn't even stay long enough to try their food. For the sake of spreading the word, please read about my experience. Where should I begin? I found an online coupon for this place it was $6.99 for their popcorn chicken + bbt + shaved ice. I thought it was a good deal so might as well try it out. I've passed by this place plenty of times, but never had the chance to go in. Now's my time. I had a schedule set for myself to meet up with a friend there for dinner, do some work on the laptop, and to have evening plans after. I arrived there only to find that they are closed for off-time in the afternoons (interesting) and re-open at 6pm. So my friend decided to patiently wait another 10 min. 20 minutes later, still nobody showed up to open the doors. We left. I was pretty angry because I had anticipated our dinner date together the entire day... And now, no dinner & no time to work on my stuff. As we drove away, we saw the owners return to unlock the doors, groceries in hand. But too bad, we have other plans. They lost their first customers for the evening. We decided to carry on with our evening plans, and return later for a late-night snack. 

Later that night, we returned. The restaurant was empty, all but one occupied booth. We went in, took a booth ourselves, and showed them our coupon. We were informed it was 75cents extra for a cold original bbt. (From the experience prior to coming, I had already given up with this place. I told my friend let's just leave and eat somewhere else.. but he insisted that we stay and try it out). So we asked to clarify the fine print on this deal. Our conversation is as follows:
Us: Is their an extra charge for a different flavour? 
Waitress: What flavour do you want?
Us: We're not sure yet but would like to inquire about the price before making a decision. 
Waitress: I can't tell you the price if you don't tell me what kind of drink you want. Right?? So tell me what drink you want so I can tell you the price. Because I mean... (reiterating over again the same thing in different words)..

Rude, offensive and unnecessary. In the end we found it was simply $1 for added flavour, could've been simply said. Next, the shaved ice. What kind of catches are there with the shaved ice? Waitress says, \"You can order any of the ones shown on the menu\". I made sure about additional ingredients (ie. tapioca, red bean). She said, Yes those are extra charge..READ the menu *she points at the bottom*...

So basically this deal comes with plain shaved ice and plain bbt. Fine. 
But after all that, I think the waitress was bit offended about the fact that I pointed that out, so she goes ahead and points out in the menu.. that their shaved ice original price is $7.99, and their popcorn chicken original price is $8.49 - that is already a good deal.

Frustration level on the high, my friend proceeds to order according to the coupon requirements. We ordered the popcorn chicken rice, an original bbt (cold), and a guava shaved ice. That's all for now. The waitress, somewhat enraged, says \"I'm sorry, but it is $4.49 min charge per person!\" *points on the menu*. That was quite unexpected between the two of us. We understand the concept of minimum charges, but a lot of places don't care about that now, as long as our total bill adds up to two person's value . And besides, we're here to share a late-night snack amongst 2 people, no big deal? But that did it for us. Service was beyond terrible, it was negative. We told them sorry we're going to leave. As we were leaving, she outrageously cleans up the menus off our tables and goes to the couple sitting in the booth behind us and says to them, \"can you believe that? they're crazy.. the menu says minimum charge...\" The rest is history. I think she happily sent us away from her business like it was her goal. Good luck with business. 

FOOD: Did not get to try. Thank goodness FMP was right across.
SERVICE: Caution: waitress likes to argue. 
AMBIENCE: Renovations nice, I'll give them that. But music was old-style Chinese folk music, not my mood for the evening and definitely does not match the surrounding.
CONCLUSION: After having nothing but a few big gulps of their ice water, I'd shred up their coupon and never return again - waste of ink. I also had a schedule planned for myself that day, and even returned for them twice - waste of time. Even though I spent $0 on this place, I'm happy though that I had this short 5-10 minute experience to confirm how bad this place is so I will never return here again. I was not only disappointed, but left with anger. If i could give this place 0 stars I would. In addition, this place is owned and run by Chinese, not Taiwanese. They definitely do not have a right to open up a store named \"Taipei Station\" if they cannot live up to the service and food quality of that in Taiwan (even though I only had their water lol). My +1 for the evening, my friend (from Taiwan) would most definitely agree."}
{"text":"Dont even bother with trying this place...

- worst Taiwanese food I've ever had.
- worst bbt i have ever drank.
- worst service ever experienced.

first opinion with this place when i walked in was ok, kind of cozy cause it's small... and than i saw the tiles on the wall at the back, which is the same kind i have in my washroom, not really suitable for a restaurant. I don't understand the huge booths in the middle with the cheesy bling on it either...

SERVICE, at first it was ok, we were offered tea or iced water... and than the menus, which had a lot of words and very little pictures, so it took awhile to choose. however after looking through the long menu and trying to choose something, most of the stuff was SOLD OUT? it was half empty and 7pm... sold out already? 

the waitresses were not knowledgeable, I did not know what QQ noodles were, however they don't know either...

FOOD/DRINKS, the bbt was very very watery, and lacked flavor, and the waitress had to serve and make drinks... no wonder they were so slow. the seafood soup base had absolutely NO FLOVOUR, what seafood? it was like hot water, with half cooked noodles and the beef noodle soup had 2 pieces of super thin beef which tasted worst than hot pot beef. The beef tendon was disgusting, also they forgot about it and said it was sold out, only to bring it out later. why lie and say its sold out when you had it? the deep fried squid balls were nothing like authentic ones, I dont mind how things looked but it had no taste.

I would rather someone with no taste cooked for me, it would taste a million times better!!

we didn't bother with dessert, we left hungry and had to eat again elsewhere..."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, the tea has no taste at all.  

The way they making iced milk tea was totally wrong. When we advised the owner that their tea tasted like water, she strongly insist that they used finest tea leaf as ingredient without realizing the issue is at the way they process it. 

My friend ordered \"honey milk green tea\", but they served one without milk. When we ask the server about it, she said \"you need to particularly ask for milk when u order milk tea.\" which totally make no sense.  And when we later asked the manager why there is no milk in milk tea, she replied that she felt  this tea tastes better without milk,  so she didn't put it in. I really don't understand the logic behind it.  Why do you put MILK TEA in mean if you don't add milk?

And the food was just a tragic disappointment. I almost cried when they served it. 

Seriously, I agreed with some previous reviews, THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. I've been teaching people about how to make tea for years, but these ppl just don't get it. U can have shitty drinks even if u use the finest ingredients."}
{"text":"Avoid avoid avoid going to this place!!  

Food was dismal.  I ordered fried chicken cutlet with rice and I literally just got chicken and rice, there was NOT a single vegetable or garnish on the plate.  My girlfriend ordered noodles with fried fish cake and guess what, she got plain noodles with a plate of fish cake and that's it, there was nothing else beside the noodles and fish cake!  Nobody serves food like that, i was totally speechless

Service was even worse.  I ordered black milk tea along with the food, but my drink never came.  The lady simply just forgot about it.  We went on a Saturdya aftenoon around 4pm so the restaruant was not busy at all ( i wonder why), so there was absolutely no excuse for that kind of mishap to happen.

Lastly, they dont accept debit or visa, so if you don't have cash you are out of luck because there's not bank nearby either.  But trust me, save your money and eat somewhere else, with the stuff they serve they shouldn't even be allowed to operate a business."}
{"text":"Words alone fail go describe how terrible a restaurant can be.  Lets start with the food. The portions were so small even a baby would find it unfilling. The soup was so tasteless you can substitute it for water and it'd taste a lot better. The texture of rice is comparable to marshland mud.  The minced meat was too small even for dumplings filling. The price for all this excuse of a meal? Absolutely unproportional.
Then we get to the atmosphere. There was a promo offer for it's grand opening, but it wasn't honoured at all. The waiter had trouble being able to explain the menu to us. The desserts were unavailable for order. 

So, if you intend to torture someone over a meal...i.e. breaking up, pissing off your boss, dinner with a mortal enemy...then go ahead, go on in. Otherwise, save your time, save your money and don't bother."}
{"text":"I been to Taipei Station twice already since it opened 2 weeks ago, once for Lunch Specials and the other time Afternoon Tea Specials. 

The menu is quite interesting and extensive. Not too many places that have menu that give me that urge thinking I want to try this, and that and I need to come back for this. 

Lunch Specials Southern Taiwanese Beef Noodle Set with Green Tea Latte ($5.49) was nicely done. It is not the spicy Taiwanese Beef Noodle, the broth is flavoured but can be a little plain. The yellow noodle was cooked al dente with a great bite. The drink was really milky just with a little hint of green tea, but is the regular size which made this lunch set a great value. 

All the staff was really friendly and even go over the menu with me when I have some question about the shaved ice dessert and even gave me a free sample of their Fresh Milk Shaved Ice with Mango bubble. 

Afternoon Tea Set Braised Pork with egg and rice and drink ($3.99) was no bad, but I found that the pork was a little rubbery and chewy maybe because it was too lean? My Lychee Black tea was refreshingly good. 

I will definitely be back for their shaved ice and other authentic Taiwanese desserts.... oh maybe some black pig blood cake?!"}
{"text":"Taipei Station offers a variety of foods to choose from which is what I love most about the restaurant; I can always try something new every time and am always statisfied by the dishes. I come here very often with friends and they enjoy the dishes Taipei Station has to offer too! Personally my favorite is the Minced pork on rice and the fried chicken cutlet. The minced pork is such a simple dish, yet it's so full of flavor and aroma. Many would say this dish looks small when presented but trust me, it's so filling!! The fried chicken is also one of my most ordered dishes simply because it reminds me of the chicken fillet I would always by in the night markets back at Taiwan. Taipei Station has really done an amazing job replicating Taiwanese food and I think many Taiwanese people would really enjoy this place.
When I'm not eating dinner, I'm eating their \"all you can eat desserts\"  selection. This offer is enexspensive and what's best about it is that I can eat a variety of desserts! From their signature flavored shaved ice, to red bean cakes, to agar jellies, the desserts can be really refreshing on a hot day! Overall, my experiences here at Taipei Station have been nothing but amazing every time I come! I would definitely recommend it to others."}
