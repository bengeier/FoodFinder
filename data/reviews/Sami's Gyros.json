{"text":"Not bad at all. Lunch special of $5.95 gets you a gyro, fries and a 20 oz drink. So if you're on a budget it is awesome. The place was super crowded at lunch time during the week so beware if you're looking for a relaxing place to chill out. Not much seating available, so be prepared to either take it to go or get real friendly with your dining neighbors. The food was good, not the best gyro I've ever had but definitely would go back for another. The portions were generous and the staff amiable."}
{"text":"My work group used to go here weekly, but I don't think we'll be going any more. The food is okay, but recently the prices have gone up considerably -- expect to pay about $11 for lunch. Add in an extra 0.50 for a dollop of hot sauce. And, they have discontinued their frequent diner card program."}
{"text":"The food comes out almost as fast as fast food, if you get the special. It's also a great place to go to when deciding what to eat becomes a chore. The gyros are super tasty, and it's quite a deal with fries and a drink.   I mean, I haven't been disappointed by any single menu item, I always get my food fast, and the staff is always helpful. I always leave this place satisfied with my choice."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Sami's Gyros last evening and we loved it.     We had their special of a Gyro with fries and a drink.     The one reviewer talked about someone that was rude and we have to say we experienced just the opposite.   Sami the owner was there and we found him to be very friendly and helpful.  He sat down with us and asked about our experience and what we did for a living.     We did not have any ketchup issue must have been resolved, because there was a bottle of ketchup at the table.     Maybe your review helped improve."}
{"text":"I must say its a great lunch spot for the working man.  However, today they may have lost a customer.  I am a regular customer that always orders the Mediterranean Chicken Dinner at least once or twice a week its my regular spot.  They give you a large portion of chicken and food and a tiny bit of tzatziki sauce.  Not nearly enough sauce to go with the whole dinner..  So today I ask for another extra tzatziki sauce from the cook that looks like a Mexican version of sloth from the Goonies said no you pay for extra and points to the person at the register that has seen me there countless number of times.  I've probably spend an average of $20 a week there and they are nickle and diming me over an extra tzatziki sauce that they don't give you enough of in the first place.  It left a bad taste in my mouth and I feel it was poor business practice to treat a regular customer that way.  So I am taking my business to Jay's Gyros down the street.  Where they do charge more but the chicken is higher quality and they will give their regular customers an extra tzatziki with all the food they give you and not charge you.  So long to this tzatziki rationing not taking care of their regulars place."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Sami's and I love it. I was here last week and had the original beef, and wow was that good, so i figured let me try them again.   Today i had the Gyro and my wife had the salad and falafel(sp??), the gyro was absolutely delicious and plentiful, the yogurt sauce reminded me of being back in Chicago, that is really good. My wife enjoyed her salad, it was fresh and crisp, the falafel were very good. I am not sure what they should really taste like, but we will get them again.   The counter girl was very nice and caring, I would defiantly go back to this place again. Keep up the good work. THANK YOU."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. The staff could learn to interact with the customers more as I could barely hear the person helping me when ordering.   I had the Greek salad add gyros. Awesome meat, veggies seemed like they might have been out a while, especially the tomatoes.   Overall good food, done quickly, eat in or take out."}
{"text":"I have to say that I really enjoy the food but there is something really odd about the girl at the cashier. I have been going to place for over a year and the same girl has been working there. She seems completely miserable that she is working. When you order your food she never greets you or says thank you. I am wondering if she forced to work there.  The funny thing, is that I am not the only one that notices this. The customers that ordered after me made the same comments as well. It actually turned into a funny conversation when I over heard them talking about it.   You could make a Seinfield episode just on this cashier girl alone."}
{"text":"I had my first taste of Sami's Gyros food last night at a networking event in Tempe. They offered Greek Salad, Mediterranean Chicken, Hummus and Pita bread. The chicken was super tasty and I made a sandwich out of that with the Hummus and the salad. I also got to meet one of the owners Lisa and really enjoyed talking to her. Hearing about all of the other yummy sounding things they have on the menu (Including baklava!) I am looking forward to visiting the Tempe location. I am a huge fan of supporting local businesses and I will be heading to Sami's soon!"}
{"text":"Great food. Quick service. A frequent lunch place for me. I a big fan of the Mediterranean Chicken Special."}
{"text":"so i just came back from my 1st visit to sami's gyros.  and i gotta say....  MEH about sums it up. i might go back but that's because the chicken med sandwich was good after one bite.  i'm hopeful there are other things to choose that i'll enjoy more than my meal, however i ate the steak sandwich and tho it looked good, it was without any moisture, the meat as well as the sandwich itself.  i then read on the wall menu for any missing extras, and saw none, perhaps they could offer something or include some kind of sauce, or condiment to this sandwich.  the fries tho given plenty of them, were also dry, and basically unsalted, so not so much there either.  humus was ok, as a side, but i'd go elsewhere if i wanted the good stuff."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but lately... the last three times I tried to eat here, I pulled up, looked at the hours on the door which showed they should be open...and they weren't.  One time there was even someone working inside, but nope, it was closed, each time on Saturday, when they should have been open.  Went in today, ordered a chicken pita, had to explain to the girl at the register twice that I only wanted the pita, not the drink and salad or fries.  Took it home, the quality wasn't there, the chicken was pretty bland, the lettuce wasn't very fresh.  Eh, I've had good meals here before, but lately, I've been really disappointed."}
{"text":"I make a point to leave for class early so that I can make a stop at Sami's Gyros! I absolutely love their chicken pitas! Flavorful chicken with the perfect amount of spices! The staff is friendly and always make sure to take care of me while I'm there. It's a great little spot right next to Starbucks and close to campus. I will be eating here every day that I have class, probably until I graduate. I have tried a few other places around town, but always make my way back to Sami's Gyros because they have excellent quality. Love this little place!"}
{"text":"Disgusting, don't waste your money. The hummus was gray, the tahini sauce was flavorless. Very sad that I spent 11 of my hard earned dollars there. Also realized when I got home, he didn't give me the pita to my hummus :-("}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  I cannot comment too much on the quality of food across the entire menu.  I have only had one item...many times: Greek salad with chicken.  Fresh veggies, good dressing, and it actually comes with a pita and tzatziki sauce (score!).  I find no reason to try anything else.  For $11 bucks...it doesn't get much better--especially for a half way decent healthy meal.   Place starts hoppin' around noon for lunch rush.  Get there earlier to avoid a wait and ensure you have a place to sit."}
{"text":"I live down the road and went here during the weekly lunch hour and had the gyro special with fries, a drink, and an order of falafel. I give them 1 star because middle eastern cuisine is by far my favorite, even with mediocre food I can be satisfied enough to finish my meal, but I did not finish any of what I wasted $14 on. Everything tasted sour, old, and/or poorly seasoned. The falafel were overcooked and too garlicky, typically I'm a garlic fiend, but it was bitter burned garlic that I could taste. The tahini tasted like spoiled yogurt. I'm not sure what part of the gyro was bad but it tasted sour as well the meat was flavorless and the tzatziki again tasted like sour yogurt with a ton of onion powder and dill. I was not impressed. I had three bites of everything except the fries and called it quits. The guy taking my order was also rushing me so much that I could barely get the words out of my mouth before he was trying to grab my card, and I almost forgot that I was craving falafel in the first place.  The french fries were good, so for that they get the one star. If anyone can recommend a decent or really good middle eastern restaurant in the area I would  appreciate it, I am still getting to know the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I was headed to work one day and decided to stop at the usual plaza for lunch. I was a little tired of Port of Subs, so I decided to give Sami's a try. About seven bucks for a gyro sandwich, fries and a drink? Sign me up.  There was a lunch rush, predictably, so they were really busy. The girl at the register had the time of her life joking and laughing with the guy in front of me. When he finally stopped schmoozing and it was my turn to order, the smiling and laughing stopped. I received a very cold disposition, like I was just one more thing between her and the end of the day. Oh well, no big deal.  I ordered, and waited. And waited. Two or three orders after mine came up first, and as the time threatened to bite into my commute, I felt antsy. Maybe the people after me all ordered salads? Still, I ordered their main, advertised special, how much longer should that take?  I'm here to say, the wait was worth it. The gyro sandwich was huge and tender, and the tzatziki was incredible. Even the fries were delicious (and fresh out of the fryer! Again, the wait was worth it.) This was one of the best gyro sandwiches I've ever had.  I will definitely come back here again, just maybe not when I have to go to work amidst lunch hour.  I made it to work on time, by the way."}
{"text":"Great Gyros!! Don't be deterred by the long line as they move you through fairly quick. Friendly, attentive staff that prepare a great product at a fair price. Will visit again next time I'm in town and attending an ASU baseball tournament at phoenix municipal stadium."}
{"text":"Great Gyros!  and they are early slammed with a line out the door or dead slow.  sometimes you get lucky and have no wait other times there is a wait but its worth it!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I go into a place and then i start to think that it'd be dicky to write a bad review of a place. really i'd like to give this place 2 stars but it gets one extra one for no reason other than I'm feeling nice.  I ordered the chicago style vienna beef hot dog. I asked if they had more than one type of dog to choose from because I prefer schnauzers. (just kidding. lighten up, people) Anyway the owner (presumably) told me that they only have one kind, \"The Best Kind.\" Sure you do, pal. I prefer like polish firedogs which some vienna beef places have or maybe polish sausage (make all your little jokes, go ahead) but as a general rule I've never had a vienna beef hot dog i didn't like.  Well this seemed to me to be more of a Bar-S than vienna beef and I felt totally aggrieved.  my pal Chris G, a man among men who yelps sparingly, had a chicken gyro which he said was so dry he had to eat it in the rain, whatever that means. the fries were lackluster.  So I'm gonna give this place 2 stars but i guess i'll put three up there because I just feel bad."}
{"text":"I came to eat lunch here with a friend that works near by and decided to pick a healthier choice. When looking at the menu the portions seemed big and reasonable but after I finished ordering I paid about 14 dollars and in return got a small foam plate of oily hummus. The chicken was good and that's why I give them a 3 star but they need to give bigger portions for the prices they charge and put more effort in there food."}
{"text":"You know when you see a girl and think she could look a lot better if she cleaned herself up, maybe dressed a little better, didn't have an eye patch, lost 300 pounds, etc.? No? Oh well.. Anyway, after reading the review's for Sami's Gyros I was hoping it would have improved upon their food. Unfortunately, she (or he - Sami is a little ambiguous) just hasn't cleaned herself up, yet.   I went here recently for the first time for lunch after getting a Groupon deal (It was close to me, okay?!) and pretty much most of the negative reviews were right. Let's break it down:  -The side salad included \"generous\" portions of one olive, one thin slice of cucumber, and one slice of tomato.  - I had the Mediterranean chicken \"sandwich\". From reading the previous reviews, I knew that I should order a side of tzatziki sauce. Unfortunately, even after soaking the \"sandwich\", the chicken was still dry as hell. So, I was left with a huge sloppy mess, which I'm okay with. Those are usually fun.  -The fries were pretty damn tasteless. Why else would you even get fries if they aren't tasty? It's not like they are healthy or anything. They ended up as useless as a fishnet condom. The ketchup packets that were included had high fructose corn syrup in them, and I don't do that. So, I used the fries as a conduit to get more tzatziki sauce into my mouth. That still didn't help the tasteless fries.    The best part was the \"China Mist\" tea. Yes, the throw in drink was the best part. I feel sorta bad for writing a bad review after using a Groupon... But fuck it. Hey Sami, what's up brah? If you need help improving your food, including your dry meat, let me know!"}
{"text":"Wow. I cant believe this place is still in business.   I walked in late one day with only a girl sitting at a table playing on her phone. Turns out she worked there. She eventually comes to the register. Really seemed like she was pissed at me cause I took her away from the phone and she had to take my order. No hello, no thank you. Just took the money and gave me change then walked back to her table to play on the phone.   Every table had trash on them. NONE were clean. She is still playing on her phone so I clear a table for myself. She does not offer to help.  I then go to the restroom and it was absolutely gross!  It had been 10 minutes and no food. I hear a couple Mexican employees in the back kinda yelling at each other in Spanish. I go to see what all the noise is about as well as check on my order. I noticed the cook and a co worker are in the back and are throwing   raw chicken around. It falls on the ground and they see me. I ask the guy where is my food and he points to the high counter where my food had apparently been sitting for 5 minutes. I was the only one in there and no one brings my food to me or tells me my food is ready. Instead the girl is on the phone at the table and the two Mexicans guys are throwing chicken around. They probably eventually cooked the chicken that was on the ground and sold it.  I wanted to ask for my money back but I was so hungry I ate the cold food. The pita was very hard and the lunch was horrible. A waste of money. I walked away pissed at myself that I did not ask for my money back.   The three employees in there DO NOT care about their customers experience in their restaurant. The more I think about the 40 minutes in there the more I get mad about not asking for my money back. First and last time for me at this place."}
{"text":"Alright, so Sami's is expensive. But then again what Greek food/Gyro place isn't. The serving sizes are amazing! I got the Gyro salad and it was huge. Definitely filled and satiated my hunger. The shop is small but can definitely be busy. It's a great place to be surrounded by business buildings. I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Their chicken is unbelievable! I could eat their chicken with Tzaziki and Pita every day. Steer clear of the fries, they tend to be a bit overcooked."}
{"text":"They wouldn't let me swap tahini sauce for the tzatziki sauce on my gyro because tahini sauce is \"only\" for falafel...God damn sauce nazis!!!"}
{"text":"Used a groupon prepaid copon for dinner.  Service was very good; after that not so good.  Food was luke warm and the salad was just average.  The Gyro plate was greasey and bland.  For $9.00+ it should have been much better.  I have had Greek food at many places and this one is at the bottom of the list.  I would pass on this one."}
{"text":"Some days I want something other than what they serve at our cafeteria. I know, I know...we have a cafeteria at my work...I really shouldn't complain but the food is expensive and not worth what you pay. Anyway...I digress...I've eaten at the Fili B's and Port O Subs in this plaza as well as the pizza place. None of that sounded good to me. I've been meaning to try Haji Baba but didn't feel like the drive...enter stage left....Sami's Gyros. I ordered a Mediterranean Chicken Sandwhich with fries and a coke - about $8.50. There was a pretty good crowd in there but my food was out in less than 5 minutes.   Nice warm pita stuffed...and I mean stuffed...with seasoned grilled chicken. I skipped the tsaziki and added a little mayo...what can I say ... I'm from the Midwest. Fries were ok but I could have skipped them. I'm not really a fry person.   Overall good food, quick service, reasonable price."}
{"text":"Sami's is quick, reliable and right around the corner from my office. It's not the best Mediterranean food I've ever had in my life, but I know that I can be in and out in 10 minutes, even when there appears to be a wait at the register. The one time I had to wait about 20 minutes, the owner apologized to me personally and gave me a free piece of baklava (which was delicious).   I've deluded myself into thinking that the gyro salad is moderately healthy (hint: it's not), so that's what I usually go for. The meat is pretty good quality, and while the greens do feel a little prepackaged, I'm getting a salad from a gyro place... so I don't expect a whole lot more.  Service is usually pretty decent, and the folks there are kind. I'd recommend it for a quick lunch, especially given the limited selection within walking distance of my office. Surely beats the pseudo-food they're handing out in styrofoam boxes up in the cafeteria... Yikes."}
{"text":"used to love the chicken and rice dish, until 2/3 rds in I found a hair, my stomach was in a knot until the following day."}
{"text":"I have to unfortunately drop by review from 5 stars to 2 stars, and for one reason: the girl at the cash register. There's really no nice way to put it: she's awful. It seems as though you're severely inconveniencing her when you order and she has to do her job.   I've been here so so many times over the years and absolutely love the food and how quick the service is, but I can no longer get past the crusty attitude of that girl at the counter. She might greet you, rarely looks at you, and if you're lucky you'll get more than one sentence out of her. She's been somewhat decent in the past, but over the past year or two has just been consistently awful (and I'm not the only one who notices).  Again, the food is absolutely amazing, but without the good service from the cash register while ordering, it's just not worth going back anymore. I'm over it, and will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Samis is just great.  you get what you pay for. and that's a Quality meal for a fair price. portions are plentiful and it's a Clean environment    Sami the Owner is frequently on site and ready to make sure you enjoy your dining experience. The staff there is also Just as attending as the Owner.  This is why i frequent Sami's at least once a week."}
{"text":"Very tasty Mediterranean Chicken pita.  I get that almost every time.  Very nice-sized portion of seasoned and juicy chicken breast meat.  I have had other items too, and they are all tasty.    Place gets busy at lunch on weekdays (a lot of office space nearby) so you might have a 5-10 minute wait.  Fries are good when HOT, but very generic, and if they get cold they are worthless.  If the fries were better, I'd give it 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, as I'd been wanting to try it and since it's close to work I figured what the heck. I was jonesing for a french fry concoction my co-worker gets. I ordered this concoction but they got it all wrong. Tasted good but it wasn't exactly how I ordered it.   I will take my co-worker with me next time I go there so the staff will get the order just as my friend orders it."}
{"text":"Skip this place! I've never had a bad gyro but this one take the cake when it comes to sucking at life. It was completely dry and had a leather quality to it. You couldn't pay me to come here again."}
{"text":"I was literally craving this place when my coworker told me he'd bought a falafel here for his lunch yesterday. I was super excited to have a Greek spot near my job, so of course I couldn't wait to go here on my lunch break the next day despite my coworker telling me his falafel sandwich was extremely dry. Really it came down to this place or bandaid in the buritto Filibertos next door...easy decision right.  So I rushed here on my lunch break, and when I walked in this young guy bussing tables near the back corner asked how he could help me. I felt he was rushing but whatever,  I told him I needed a minute. With a short lunch, and this being my first visit, I decided to just order pita and hummus, after all you can't screw up hummus...can you?  Well they did, because this place sucked! The pita was extremely thin and dry, and tasted kind of like those stale communion crackers I ate at church growing up. Seriously the hummus had no flavor at all. With Athenos brand hummus being one of my favorites you would think I'm easy to please in this regard,but I cringed at each bite, and throwing food away that I'd bought while super hungry was not an option.   I should've questioned their authenticity when another customer ordered a burger and fries...because really you would NEVER do that at an authentic Greek spot that was worth the money and the experience. The second eyebrow raise came when I realized the cooks were Mexican. Don't judge me, you think the same thing about Panda Express.     Anyhow, I would never go here again, it's disgusting flat out, their customer service skills are well, like their pita...tasteless and besides I'd rather get the real deal at a better price and much better cultural experience. If you don't know the Greek experience I'm referring to then maybe you're a regular here haha kidding :-D"}
{"text":"I work across the street from Sami's so I thought I would give it a try.  I am glad my pita sandwich was only $6, because I couldn't make myself finish it so I had to go somewhere else and buy another lunch.  There wasn't much good about the sandwich - the pita was dry, the falafel was like something sold in Sam's Club frozen section, and there was barely any lettuce on the sandwich.  I have never had pureed cat litter, but I suspect it would taste a lot like Sami's hummus.  I can't wait to go home after work so I can brush my teeth and get this awful taste from the hummus out of my mouth.  I didn't order any french fries, but they looked like they were probably pretty good."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! The worker Eddie refused to be of assistance, not sure if he is the owner or just an employee. If owner...sad attitude for his business. The service he provided today was horrible, has make me refuse to ever attend his restaurant. I might just now go to the Princess though further away.  The food is now over price, get less than before. Refuse to be of service!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and always get the gyro combo with fries. I order the fries extra crispy and in my opinion that makes them 10x better! I could honestly just have the fries and be full as the portions are huge! The tzatziki sauce is excellent and the gyro meat is always cooked just right, not too salty and never dry."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while searching for something tasty. I saw a decent rating on Yelp but nothing quite compares to the experience. I ordered the gyro special ($7.99) which included a side salad that I've yet to try because I'm still eating the gyro... and the leftovers are just as delicious as my very first bite!  I was expecting a good meal, but this restaurant exceeded my expectations!!  I am in LOVE!! The gyro was seasoned to perfection!! Wow!  I will never come within a 30mile radius without dining here. I highly recommend this place!! Is it yummy?! YELP!! ;)"}
{"text":"I work in the area and just discovered Sami's as the newest occupant of the plaza on the northeast corner of Priest and Washington.  It's about time we get more dining options in that area and I just so happen to be a fan of gyros.  The set up is much like the other places in the plaza where you order at the counter and then they call your number.  Basically fast food style but for a quick bite for lunch what else do you need?    The daily lunch special is a gyro with fries and a soda for only $5.95.  The only complaint I have is that they need to add more tsatzki sauce because it was a little too dry for my liking.  You will just need to add a side to your order.   The bazmati rice and greek salad are quite tasty and can be ordered as sides too.    It can get crowded at lunch so get here before noon and you can actually grab a table inside.  If you throw in your business card at the counter bowl you can win a free lunch like I did!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  The snobby girl at the register does not greet you, does not state the price of your order, and does not reply to hello or thank you. She just holds out her hand for cash."}
{"text":"Sami's Gyros is a better than average lunch joint light rail close to my place of employment.  You get a quick, hearty meal for less than 8 bucks.  The gyro meat is plentiful, but nothing special. The gyro meal comes with fries and a drink. The grilled breast meat chicken gyro sandwich is probably their best product, and I highly recommend it.  The best part of the operation is the speed of service.   It is not uncommon for the servers calling your number before you have filled your drink and found a table.  Overall, a solid lunch place."}
{"text":"The food is great, perfectly cooked and seasoned. I recommend this place to friends all the time."}
{"text":"Always call before you go- Everytime we've wanted to grab some grub, they're always either closed when the door hours say OPEN or 2 minutes till closing.. Yelp says hours open till 4, but they say 3pm.  They should really fix that."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick lunch. The menu is typical of other gyro places, but the service is fast -  I was in and out with my takeout order within 5 mins on a Monday at noon. The $5 lunch deal is a steal and very good!   Their Mediterranean Chicken sandwich was better than I've had at other places and has extra seasonings on it.  Also, if you're on the Light Rail you can get off at the Washington and Priest stop, and it's right there!"}
{"text":"I was really teetering between 2-stars and 3-stars.  There were more negatives than positives, but I chose 3 because my husband really enjoyed his gyro and the chicken was so flavorful.  But lets go over the negatives because there are a lot of fast food greek options in this area. I probably won't return because of these 4 things.  1) very slow.  i ordered, they said 10 minutes.  the reality was 30 minutes.  There was only one other customer.  (and a homeless man, but I actually like that they allowed the homeless man to be inside because it is 100-degrees outside).  In addition, when I called to order, they asked me to \"call back in three minutes.\"  2) Order was incomplete.  I definitely asked for a side of tzatziki sauce.  I definitely did not get ANY tzatziki sauce.  Usually, there is at least some the comes with the gyro, but not only do they not provide tzatziki, WHICH IS THE BEST CONDIMENT IN THE WORLD!, they charge .50 cents for any at all, and then forget to put it in the bag. I was sad.  3) Luckily, we ordered hummus, which is not as good as tzatziki but it is better than nothing. However, the amount of hummus was pitiful for $4.  It was tasty though -- but the pita bread was stale, cold, and looked store bought.  4) Finally, the french fries were unseasoned and cold.  We didn't finish them and we are a family of four -- usually, we fight over the last fry.  Like I said, the chicken was very very good.  It was pretty oily, but whatever they use to season it is AMAZING.  It really earned this place a whole star, without the chicken, it would have been an easy 2-star decision."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! I got the gyro special and it was delicious. I went for lunch and service was quick. It is reasonably priced and a great value. I highly recommend if you're looking to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The food is a solid 4 stars but the pony tail girl at the counter makes the overall experience horrible. She's on her phone ALL THE TIME!!! While I was placing my order she never looked at me but was looking at her phone and smiling about something she was reading. After patrons left and i was the only customer in the restaurant, rather than cleaning tables off she was staring at her phone. When new patrons arrived, they had to clean off their own tables. I asked for the ice tea to be refilled while she was resting her head in one hand with her elbow on the counter while the other hand holds her phone. She sighed and s-l-o-w-l-y got up from staring at her phone to take care of the ice tea. Once it was replaced she went back to the leaning on the elbow thing. This is not a one time thing, she's done this on all of my three visits.   How does management not see this? Or do they???"}
{"text":"Food is pretty solid, however, the grumpiest girl alive works the counter... I recommend the Mediterranean Chicken, but do not look into her eyes when you order."}
{"text":"Always a great place to get lunch  In 6 years never had anything that was a disappointment! Owners are amazing people. Sami and Lisa"}
{"text":"Underwhelming gyro. There are french fries with it? First question: why? Second question: why are they not any good? I will say one good thing, it was cheap, and I didn't leave hungry."}
{"text":"I take the light rail into work every day, and have been wanting to stop at Sami's Gyros for a while now.  I finally got to!  yay!  Anyways, I was on my way downtown to the baseball game and was starving.  I had busy Saturday morning, and didnt have time to stop beforehand to get some food.  So, I boarded the light rail early and decided to stop at Sami's to try it out.  I was glad I did.  This place was great.  They have a great menu, and prices are reasonable.  It was rather quiet on a Saturday afternoon, but I was also in there at 3:30 and they close at 4 on Saturdays, so most people had either already eaten.  I got a Gyro, Greek salad and coke.  I think it cost me about $8.50, and it was more then enough for me.   Great serving size, I felt like I got what I paid for here, serving wise.    BUT, there were a few things on the Gyro that I noticed. I dont know if it was because I was there so close to closing time, or if this is the way that it always is, but the meat seemed a little dry to me.  I won't hold it against them, but it was probably becuase I was there so late.  Also, I wished they had put a little more of the sauce on the gyro.  I felt like that it was just not enough for me.   I also like this place beause its right off the light rail at the Priest and Washington stop.  Easy on, easy off.  I do recomend this place.  The service was good and I enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"If I am in this part of town for meetings, I try to make it to Sami's for their gyros.  Lines move fairly quickly so it is very convenient for lunch on the run."}
{"text":"I really like Sami's Gyros.  They are a good place to have lunch that is affordable and healthy (if you want).  When I was really focusing on calories I was glad when my lunch companions chose this place because the gyro was relatively low calorie and they have some nice alternatives to fries (dolmas, falafel).   My last trip I had an Italian Sausage with fries and it was very tasty with grilled onions on it.  The fries also were pretty good, crispy and fresh, not greasy."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, the new manager is an idiot, my food came out raw, yes raw. When I brought it to his attention he had the nerve to say: it's only $8.00 dude get over it. Hmm, good job on sending me away and never going back to such bad place. With all do respect to Sami and his family, the place is not good anymore"}
{"text":"I work nearby and eat here probably 5 or 6 times a year for lunch.  I usually eat here when I just have a craving for french fries as it's the only place near work that serves them.  The gyros are like eating a brick as they're just very heavy in the stomach.  The meat is too salty.  I've tried their chicken version but found the chicken to be dry."}
{"text":"Had a quick take out lunch here. Food was good and ready in a matter of minutes.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! My co-workers and I had just landed in Phoenix (this was a couple of weeks ago) for our business trip and we were all starved so we drove from the airport over here. My one co-worker used to live in the area and he said he wanted to try the Phoenix Brewery place but when we got there, they really didn't have much of a food selection so we decided to randomly try this place instead.  Mmm gyros. I got a gyro and some hummus. The hummus wasn't the best I've ever had but it was pretty good. The gyro was straight-up dope. I don't see why people don't like this place...maybe there are high standards for gyros in Phoenix or something, but this was pretty good. I love that the sauce had dill in it, mmm.   Another co-worker had ordered the combo with the rice and the rice smelled straight up amazing. I was drooling. I should have ordered rice too!  All in all, cheap delicious food and hardly any wait time for it. A+"}
{"text":"They make a good gyro, only thing I have ordered..  the French fries are a hit and miss and service has also step up a notch.  Stopped taking Apple Pay or any phone payments..  I really enjoyed the convenience and will not go there as often because of the lack of Apple Pay..  Sounds silly I know, but I love the conscience!  *** updated ***  They have fixed their Apple Pay!!"}
{"text":"I must say I was hesitant to even come to this restaurant when my step mom suggested it due to its low ratings. I am happy (or maybe sad?) to report that my step mom was right and Yelp was, well, not so much. This place was crazy good.... like, ridiculously tasty. The difference may be that we came at night and apparently at night they re-grill their chicken (at lunch they said they're too busy), which makes the chicken both tender and a little crunchy. We had the chicken plate and the chicken pita with a side of hummus. The chicken plate was the best item, with tasty rice and perfectly seasoned chicken. The pita was also exceptional, dripping with some kind of tasty sauce. Anyway, I would certainly come back!"}
{"text":"drove way out of my way to come here and i got here at 5:45 on wendsday and there open to 6pm. just ordered a gyro and fry and got a total bullshit attitude from one of the employees!! he asked me something and i didnt hear him so he just acted discusted and never asked me again.  total asshole peorid!! wont be comming here again. if you dony want to be open to 6 then close at 530!! disgusted with the customer service!!! i own a customer service oriented business in if I was his employer he would have got fired. I got my food and now I'm sitting right in front of the place and its only 5:56 he was done before they even closed.  it was the older balding short guy"}
{"text":"Sami's is a Greek gyro pita joint in mostly typical fashion.  They have the classic and the additional items you would expect including burgers and salads.  We really like their gyro pitas but just have a hard time making it over here due to their hours.  On weekends they close real early so we manage to miss the hours any time we think about coming over here, bug we totally get it, this is s lunch spot.  Their fries are also real thin, crisp and filling (they don't skimp on the fries, you'll need to split one side of fries for two people). On that note, the gyro meat is bountiful as well, you definitely get a good value here! They also have good ice tea, which we always appreciate.  Haven't tried the humus or falafel, but will have to put that in the plan for next time."}
{"text":"Eh, another mediocre place, Quick late lunch...Don't expect the type of Gyro you get from Greek restaurant. Will find some other fast food next time in the area."}
{"text":"Bottom Line - Very balanced and tasty Gyros as long as you set your expectations for everything else very low.  Service - 1/5 The cashier was on her cell phone texting as I waited for her to take my order.  This is my third time at this restaurant in four months and she is there in the same pose every time.  Consistency is king.  Personality - 2/5 The restaurant has the elements of a Greek restaurant assembled poorly.  It doesn't feel inviting but is clean and presentable.  Quality - 4/5 The Gyros are just right and very tasty.  The balance of ingredients lets each one shine through and there is enough sauce to enhance the flavor without becoming a goopy mess.  Of the three times I have been the fries are bland and poorly seasoned, so on my last visit I didn't bother and focused on the entree.  Recommendation - 2/5 My experience at this restaurant has been the same every time, but the Gyro is worth all the detractors.  As long as you have that in mind this is a great spot."}
{"text":"Went here on the way back to work on my lunch break, never been here before and was starving. Unsure of what to order, I decided on the steak salad. For one, this is a greek place and they dont have pepperocini? dissappointed. Got my salad and the dressing was just gross. tasted like oil and vinegar and thats it. The tzaziki sauce was the least favorite of all that I have tried. The salad was just tasteless, had bell peppers tomato and cucumber on it for veggies, thats it. The steak was good but that was the only good part of the meal. The lettuce was just like iceberg lettuce chopped up absolutely no variety. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"In the movie \"Point Break,\" Gary Busey, playing the role of Angelo Pappus, says I line I used to use.  \"Around the corner, there is a sandwich shop that sells meatball sandwiches, best I have ever tasted.\"  I used to use this line before going to Sami's, until today.  You took the meatball sub, THE meatball sub of the menu.  I looked at the menu for about 2 minutes, didn't see it.  I asked the guy at counter \"Hey, do you still have the meatball sub?\"  I was told no.  I had been thinking of that sub for a few hours.  I received the equivalent of blue balls in some sort of distorted food equation.  If I wrote this review before today, you would have received 5 stars for that sandwich alone.  Since I wrote it today, you know what you got.  I feel that strongly about the situation because I don't have much else going for me.  I haven't been this upset since saved by the bell was moved to the mornings when it used to be in the afternoons.  Your Gyros are way too dry for me to eat them, and nothing else is good enough to keep me coming back.  Except for that meatball sub.  I had a punch card, buy 11 meals and your 12th is free.  It was almost all the way filled up.  I had to put that in the garbage today to prove to myself I will never return until your meatball sub does.  It was surrendered, like my faith in Sami's.  It is like you broke up with me via text messaging.    Johnny Utah is NOT bringing me my meatball sandwiches.  This Calvin and Hobbes is NOT funny.  I DO want some oranges.  Sami's....  You have failed."}
{"text":"Apparently when i'm not at work i'm stalking Richard Z. or maybe it was the other way around...  i am giving 3 stars, but honestly they could do alot better. the atmosphere is kinda like a new business who spent alot of the loan on the inside and didn't consider the food in the budget.  i liked sitting down and watching the big flat screen. but..my fries were kinda boring, and the gyro was kinda dry, the tzayki (however thats spelled) was ok..it helped lubricate the meat as it went down. thinking i was gonna get smaller portions i also ordered some hummus. but instead of a plump flatbread that i guess i'm spoiled with..i get flat tortillas. Hummus was also kinda bland. could have used some flavor assistance. but..all in all. it wasn't that bad..so i'll stick with the A-OK   look i'm not greek, so i could care less how these thing should really taste. so for what its worth. the taste was A-OK."}
