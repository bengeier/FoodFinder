{"text":"Stopped in here opening week and there was a line out the door. It moved fairly fast and it seemed most people were getting to go orders. I noticed the people in the restaurant eating and waiting on their food. A mother with 2 kids was waiting with a number at her table before we arrived and when we left 40 mins later she was still waiting, pacing looking around for an employee- as her two kids tried to keep themselves entertained. The eating area could have defiantly used some attention that day. When we got to the order counter the worker was friendly and asked what we wanted and to let him know if it was a custom taco or seafood cause they would need to start to cook it. We opted for the build your own. 
Where I am from in Wisconsin Chipotle doesn't exist. Instead we have a local place very similar called BA Burrito. That stands for Big A** Burrito. Same concept with the fresh local ingredients. So when I came to AZ and knew there was Chipotle I was excited to try it. I've been there three times and just do not care for them. This place Uberrito is much better with fresher looking and tasting items. They have an amazing array of toppings. The only thing I miss about BA Burrito is that they add all your ingredients in to a bowl and mix it up before putting it in the burrito, ensuring that ever bite with taste of goodness. I will be back and hopefully some of the hype with have died down and I won't have to wait 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Been here several times since I live walking distance. Here's goes nothing.

Negative: I really hate asking for ketchup when I order my kids Chicken Tenders. Self serve ketchup should be available instead of giving out Minnie packets like McDonald's hands out. I really HATE the chips that come as a side with the Chicken Tenders. They are too dry, thin, stale and flavorless. 
The staff needs to know the menu better. I was there two days ago and It threw me off when I got offered apple juice that supposedly comes with my kids chicken tenders. I feel ripped off since I've been there several times with my kids and never once got asked for drink preference for my kids.
Please try to fix this matters.

Positive: Different tortilla options is a plus. I'm in love with my Grilled Chicken Burrito! Hot salsa, refried beans and grilled corn makes it even more amazing."}
{"text":"New place, not Bad. Everything seems fresh and good quality and the workers are nice. Burrito bowls are small though, better off sticking to chipotle"}
{"text":"Just came by this place because i wanted to see what all rhe hype was about. Overall not that much different from chipotle. Wont be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Goodbye Chipotle.  We have converted.  Vegetables looked and tasted fresh. Variety of -fresh- meat selection was amazing. They could maybe give a little more meat than their small scooper they use however overall it was extremely tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"I've never left a review on Yelp before, but I had to for this place. Absolutely flippin delicious. Like Chipotle and Pancheros but better. The tacos are also phenomenal. Try it out, you'll dig it"}
{"text":"Not a good first impression. It's my first time here so I needed time to look over the menu. I let people go ahead of me til I decided. When i approached the front I had a few questions where I was greeted with an \"ugh hurry up\" attitude. Then I was brushed off to the next person on the serving line and watched him serve a small scoop of each ingredient and literally pressed down the food after. By the time I got the small shredded beef bowl I ordered, it was filled a quarter of the way. Sorry but $6.80 didn't seem to cover the amount of food I got in return. Place was clean and music playing was good. Taste & quality was average. You can get a better lunch deal somewhere else. Oh and when I asked if they had a combo meal, they showed me a cookie and a drink.. how old is the majority of their clientele, 5?"}
{"text":"Having this establishment near GCU, or at least near its location (approximately 14 miles). It's convenient to have a place with delicious food. That truly serve fresh ingredients and cater to your dietary needs that include: vegan and vegetarian options. Don't worry they have a great variety of protein options for that meat lover in your family. With reasonable price's I highly recommend this hidden gem. The only downfall is location wish Uberrito closer to campus but still worth the drive."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on cinco de mayo at exactly 10pm. We may have even walked through the doors at 9:58pm. We start looking at the menu, there's tons of people inside and outside and two people ahead of us ordering food. All of the sudden 
A woman that looked like maybe a manager rudely says that they are CLOSED. 

.........you're.... closed ? Really cause there's a ton of people in here and people ordering, those were my thoughts. 

We said, ok...

So we left. 

Uberrito, don't you think that in that instance the customer shouldn't be turned away? Your doors were wide open and there were customers every where, even ordering food a foot in front of us? It would have taken 5 minutes to make us a burrito. I can understand if it was dead in there and there is no one ordering food... I've worked in restaurants for 6 years. We have been waiting to try this place because it's extremely close to our house. We definitely would have been regulars. 

Your stupid lady manager just lost you guys money. 

Bummer. 


Hard to review positively with this sort of experience. 


Good luck Uberrito. 

We ended up going to MOD and it was delicious, we are frequent there. The staff is very friendly and we would have never experienced this sort of customer service there.."}
{"text":"My husband I stopped by the other night and the food looked like it had been sitting out for days. Should have left at that point but we ordered anyway. We both felt sick after we ate. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"I've come to Überrito twice in the past 3-4 weeks and there's no sign of stopping! It is fresh and the customer service is lovely. We appreciate the varied ingredients and my husband loved the nachos! Thank you for a couple of great experiences. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Really like This Place! A step up from its competition.. Vegan burrito too is a great option"}
{"text":"As vegetarians we loved the variety of options. The staff was friendly and patient with us as newbies who were a little slow to navigate the list of possible combos.  The flavors were great and the value excellent. We are glad to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food is delicious every time. But stars are dinged from the consistent terrible service. I've tried phone in orders to pick up, delivery orders as well as dine in which every time you're greeted with nothing but blank, angry glares from half the staff. Not even a simple \"welcome in\" \"what can I get for you\" or \"have a good day\". It's order, pay, leave. The staff is entirely made up of unprofessional and inconsiderate employees. I've never had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I arrived at 8:30 PM.  Uberrito closes at 9PM.  I tried to order tacos, but I was told that even though they close at 9 PM they closed down the grill at 8:30 and I would have to order some food along the \"line\".  With 4 employees standing around with very little to do, I asked if someone could possibly make a quesadilla?  One person did the eye rolling but a young man came out of the back and offered to make the quesadilla.  The food on the \"line\" was horrid.  It was old and tasted like it.  I paid about $20 for what I don't know and never received a receipt.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it, but...  It is dull, bland food, dished out by someone cafeteria style.  Biggest crime is:  No Salsa Bar!  You just have to hope your server dishes out what you want.  No salsa bar in AZ is a crime.  Too much cheap rice, uninspiring chicken, even the jalapenos were mild.  Tomato and rice all over the floor where we sat.  Food was cold, uninspiring.  This is boring franchise food, I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"newly placed arcadia location is fantastic I visit often, the black beans are flavorful followed by deliciously marinated meat. I've had the bowls..fish tacos...nachos..and never been disappointed you got my vote over Chipotle any day. And the customer service...most important part has always been great..keep up the good work guys.!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place since it opened. Stopped in for quick snack. Had the Two-timer taco and it was delicious. 
The staff were very friendly and the interior of the dining room and what I could see if the kitchen were very clean. Only disappointment was one size of drink-20 oz and I had to wait for them to brew ice tea (both unsweetened containers were empty at 330 pm).
Will come back for a bigger meal."}
{"text":"Basically Chipotle but with more choices and options at every level. I got a bowl with steak, Spanish rice, black beans, pico, spicy avocado salsa, chipotle sauce,and greens to finish it off. The bowl was pretty tasty, and you're able to taste the flavors of the salsa and steak without it being too overwhelming. 

I appreciated the manager (or maybe he was the owner?) coming out to greet our party to see how we were doing, and he gave us all two coupons to use for when we come back. Coupons ranged from bogo burrito to free chips and guacamole. Used the chips and guac coupon, and they give you three scoops and a pretty large bag of chips! 

Definitely coming back try out their other options! 

Update:
Found the best combo-steak and shredded beef! SO FLAVORFUL!"}
{"text":"Uberrito was recommended by a friend so I went for lunch today. The line was out the door and it took me 20 minutes to get to order and when I finally got to the counter, the guy taking orders started making food on the line and the order process came to a halt. I ordered the cod burrito and went thru the process only to have my order placed in line with a bunch of others waiting for stuff off the grill. Granted this place is new but the service was unorganized and lacked leadership. The owner (?) in a red shirt was busy saying hello to what appeared to be friends and wasn't properly taking care of his customers.
My food finally arrived, it was ok. A bit salty and the fish was lost among the rice and beans. There was a guy passing out coupons for the next visit and when I told him the food and service was disappointing he didn't seem to care, said it was because they are still new. Not a good way to introduce a new place! 

Maybe it will get better but they really need to come up with a way to serve the grill products faster so the food is hot when it's finally dropped at your table. Will I go back? Maybe. But I wouldn't drive out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"The variety they have compared to Chipotle makes this place really tempting, but they just don't have the customer service or flavor down like Chipotle does. 

They're stingy on the amount they give you (sour cream \"drizzles\" on a bowl?) and unless you're getting one of the proteins that's ready and waiting, expect to wait 10 minutes to get your shrimp or fish. 

Flavor wise, eh. The black beans weren't cooked all the way and though they've got really great salsa and sauce options, again, the amount they give you isn't enough to really make a difference.

$20 for a bowl, drink, and chips that aren't nearly as flavorful as Chipotle's? I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"This location is every thing you want in a fast food establishment. The staff is friendly and getting faster every day. The dining room is always spotless and the location and parking availability is great. Neat idea to key their frequency card to your phone number."}
{"text":"Disappointingly, after a short DM back and forth with Lindsey (Dir of Marketing) over a month ago about wanting to reach out to me, I have not heard from the Area Supervisor, Will."}
{"text":"They have a $5 chicken special on Mondays, which is always good. They have a nice variety of sauces and toppings for the food, and offer tacos, burritos, bowls, and nachos. Great place!"}
{"text":"We were disappointed, frankly. 

We watched 3 employees stand around rather than help us until the Manager appeared.  It was our first time there so he gave us the run down. He then disappeared as did any sense of urgency or spirit in the staff. I ordered a burrito bowl and my wife ordered two tacos. My bowl was ready immediately as the server \"built it\" as we walked along the counter. They have a number of interesting options - more than Chipotle - like spinach and mushrooms as well as a wider variety of proteins but not I think as good. The tacos took much longer to prepare and once they were ready, the cashier simply ignored them while we stood and watched. As I finally walked up to request them, the \"taco chef\" prompted the cashier, who handed me our order without so much as glancing at me. 

Might we try it again?  Maybe. But the combination of just okay food and uninterested staff left us wondering why we'd try it again. It was inexpensive...."}
{"text":"I never write any reviews but lately my family and I have expirenced some odd things at this location. We love it here and eat her almost daily so its a family favorite abd dont want a couple bad seeds ruining it for us so we never complained. 
Although the last few times we have came in theres a couple staff memebers that really offened us and when we tried to complaine they pretended to be the ones in charge so they wouldnt get into trouble. We hate confrontation so we just left. 
This staff memebers were female morning shift one is a short small kind of on the heavy side with some arm tattoo showing female with thick glassee she usually is rude and disrespectful so we just ignore it most times but she was being so vulgar talking loudly about drugs, sexual encounters, racist name calling, and being gangster as she put it. She then proceeded to pull out her phone where they were preparing our tacos and making vulgar face chats with someone half naked we could see it all from the register area. Then the bald man in the taco area was giving her finger foods to eat while making our food. The taco man was throwing stuff around joking with her it was very disturbing. Then she proceeded to come towards the register again with her boobs showing because her shirt became unbuttoned. We asked her for the management information and she said she was the one in charge and could handle any issues we had. My family was in a hurry and felt she was trying a fast one so we just left.
We don't want a comp card or a sit down we just wanted to inform management of the behavior of a couple bad seeds working there."}
{"text":"I had the Tree Hugger and the Off The Hook tacos. Super Delicious! Fresh and flavorful. 
Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"eh - better selection than Chipotle but price seem to change on a day to day basis and the quality is marginal."}
{"text":"Tried it today for the first time. Not at all impressed! The food was cold. Who does cold nachos!!? Will never be back. This location is dirty with a bunch of kids working there. Get to work, and clean the glass it's filthy! The floor was dirty. Everyone besides the cooks were just  standing around socializing. I even overheard the guy at the register drop a F* bomb."}
{"text":"I've been I this new restaurant four times now, starting originally at the grand opening. The food is pretty good and I love all the variety and different choices that are available. The down side to this place is that whether they're busy or completely dead, it takes an extremely long time to get your order. Today it was very empty only one other guest sitting down and the guy who started my order put the shrimp in and handed me a number then proceeded to skip me and help the guy behind me (looked like someone he knew since they were talking a lot) and then no one came to help me. Waited 5 minutes while 6 employees were behind the counter chatting with one another and finally the only woman working saw me and came over and asked if she could help me. Not good for the service to already be subpar. Kyle checked me out and I asked if any managers were working and he said yes him and one other.... so I told him and he seemed disappointed the service was lacking but just said \"sorry about that\". Hopefully they can get back to the great service they had the first week or I'll just go back to chipotle and save myself 15 min of waiting in line for an order."}
{"text":"I seriously cant get enough of this place. The food is amazing. Fresh and so flavorful. Recommend the loyalty program. Go out and try it, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved all the options.  It was like Chipotle on steroids.  Way more options to choose from.  I got the Steak Nachos and packed on the extras.  The food was really good and a nice size portion.  It has only been opened a week and the line  was out the door, but they handled it well.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Come here every Monday for the $5 chicken bowls. One of the best places for fresh mex in the valley. Affordable and delicious, especially on Monday!

Would have loved to give a 5 star review but my dining experience was taken down a notch by an older worker (maybe a manager?) with a red shirt on yelling on his cell phone, complaining about the tacos Uberrito sells while the rest of the employees were working hard inside."}
{"text":"We had our first experience here today and I was very pleased.  The interior is clean and bright.  I got the grilled chicken burrito bowl and was able to customize it.  They have a lot of options to choose from and their ingredients taste very fresh.  Yalnah (sorry for butchering the spelling!) helped us and he was super helpful and explained all the options.  Thanks for a great first experience!  We will be coming back!  They also have a rewards program that I'll be putting to good use."}
{"text":"$5 chicken bowl (or burrito) Mondays. Good deal that makes my team @ work make the drive from Tempe to Arcadia for lunch. Plus, the various sides and toppings allow you to mix it up with every visit."}
{"text":"This review is like my mouth right now: on fire. Their hot salsa + pickled jalapenos are NO JOKE. I am a spicy gal. I can handle ghost pepper sauce but something about this had me crying at my desk. 

I love their variety! I chose the vegan picadillo (don't expect fake ground beef - it's tofu) with fajita veggies, Spanish rice, and black beans. Unfortunately this caused the burrito to be super soggy. I think next time I'll opt for a bowl. 

A man checking out had nachos that looked superb. I would give this place a 3 for vegans but I know that it would have been 10x better had I been able to add the extras (sour cream, cheese, etc.) so they deserve a 4."}
{"text":"Love the location and food however, staff needs work.  Every time I've gone, staff seems more concerned with what their colleagues are doing than focusing on the customer ordering.  They always get confused at the register, I have to repeat everything I already ordered and they seem disinterested in a speedy outcome. Shout out to one employee, Courtney, who noticed my frustration and took charge to get things done correctly.  We need more of her!"}
{"text":"Bland, tasteless, corporate \"Mexican\" food. No salsa bar to add to your own dish. Floor beneath our table had bits of rice and tomato smeared about, and workers standing nearby were too busy talking to each other to notice...definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Very impressed. They gave out a ton of free coups and swag for opening day and the food was delicious. I had a bowl with fajita steak and the meat was tender and juicy. They have a TON of toppings, including mushrooms and sautéed spinach. My wife had the grilled shrimp and it was very flavorful as well. 

They do offer tortillas on the side if you have a bowl and they off 4 different tortillas. The spinach tortilla was very good. Don't neglect the aioli that they offer at the end of the line. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The people here are SO NICE! I would literally come back just for the friendly service because that's hard to find. They have a lot of options and the food is so fresh. I picked up lunch for myself and a friend and it was all delicious. The portions were large and everything we ordered was flavorful."}
{"text":"It was a terrible experience that made me wish I'd gone to Chipotle instead! 

It starts out ok, the menu is a little weird and confusing.  Then the assembly is a hectic hostile and clumsy mess!!  You shouldn't feel aggressively pressured to request what toppings you want in your bowl, especially when there are people in front of you and you can't even see what the options are.  Maybe instead of blankly staring at you, you can list some of the options. 

The line is about 5 people running around getting this and that.  The items are disorganized which doesn't help with the 3 stooges feel of it.  I almost walked out leaving the mess behind, 3 different people leaned and talked over my bowl after it was done. 

The queso is like watery cheese sauce w raw jalapeño and red pepper dices in it. 

I really see no reason to go back.  What a hot mess!  I've also never been so upset by the assembly line people at subway and Chipotle before!!  Terrible attitude, terrible queso!"}
{"text":"The queso was good!  Also, when you buy chips,  you get refills! It's like a chipotle, but better ingredients."}
{"text":"Great new addition to Phoenix!  We stopped in for lunch last weekend and ended up with a shredded beef bowl and a grilled shrimp bowl with our own customized toppings.  It was absolutely delicious and I love that the seafood choices are made fresh instead of sitting out all day - bonus!  Inviting dining room, friendly staff and delicious food - a winning combination in my book!"}
{"text":"Had a negative experience initially but after talking with someone from
Corperate I am very pleased with their customer service!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome employees! I always order from here and they're all very nice and do a great job accommodating special requests."}
{"text":"Probably the slowest service I have seen since the fall of the iron curtain. The line barely moves and ordering is a long complicated process. 

I must say that the food is tasty, but not necessarily worth the wait. 

I would recommend the shredded beef bowl.

I did try it a second time and must say that the service has improved. The best part is that you can basically build your own burrito. 

It is a worthwhile meal for under $10.00."}
{"text":"Delicious everything. Try everything twice. That's what I plan to do. Reasonable wait times. Helpful service. Plenty of seating both inside and out."}
{"text":"Great ingredients for a burrito bar.  So many protein choices, vegetable choices. Great price point and a mile from my office.  I got the MINI burrito because I'm not a big eater, but it felt like it was just enough.  A step up from chipotle because you can order sauteed mushrooms, fresh cilantro, red onion, 6 different salsas/sauces, all kinds of veggies, 3 types of tortillas, or you can order it salad style with lots of condiments.  Awesome combos to get customized flavor."}
{"text":"11/15 
A nice clean restaurant and I really like the floor plan. 
I ordered 1 off  the hook taco  it was delicious, but next time I'm going to order it on a flour tortilla as I'm not really a fan of the corn ones. I also ordered 1 tree hugger taco, it was different and good, but something was a little salty and we all know I'm not a fan of salt.

11/22
I had to change my rating from a 4 star to a 3 star.
I ordered the off-the-hook taco on the flour tortilla and I felt like the fish was too fishy. I ordered chips and queso, which was average. I may give this place one more try with a bowl but I'm on the fence."}
{"text":"There are flies everywhere. Thered was even one stuck on top of the tortilla cover. I find their menu to be confusing, as well."}
{"text":"Love the place! Its like chipotle but better.. you have alot more options for proteins,salsas and so  on only thing i would give chipotle the upper hand is on their guacomole"}
{"text":"Great quality food.  Great service!!   Had tacos and tortilla soup both were outstanding. Will come back to try more"}
{"text":"Similar to chipotle. However, two major difference for me between here and chipotle. Number 1 this place does not nearly have as good of meat and number 2 this place has much more toppings and they are really fresh so I dig that.  I also like the fact that you can build your own nachos. They definitely make fat loaded bowls if you request lots of toppings. Check out my pictures."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today after a friend has had mostly positive things to say about it. The restaurant was not busy. Asked for a fajita steak burrito, and was told that they were out of fajita steak and would not have any for a while.

I've worked and managed in a lot of different restaurants. Why would you wait until you are completely out of a menu item for you to make more? I could see the steaks on the grill and they were still completely raw. The entire concept revolves around quick and customizable food. I understand being concerned about having to throw food out if it is not used, but if that was the case, make a smaller batch.

I wasn't feeling anything else, as I was hoping for a steak burrito. 

All I got was a \"sorry.\". No explanation, no reason to return, and they still charged my partner full price for his bowl. A slight discount at least would have been nice.

I don't think either of us will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Just go to chipotle. Better quality meat, fresher veggies, and tastier rice. About the same price. The workers are friendly though."}
{"text":"Big fan of providing more burrito options in the area.  America's has grown stale, we miss the old Revo Burrito, and the quality at Rubio's is inconsistent. The neighborhood is ripe for another option.  Unfortunately there are glitches that need to be addressed.  Each visit so far has been greeted with a challenge.  The most notable was when I ordered a small fish burrito and they could only charge me for a large but still made the small.

Overall the food has been solid and I do appreciate the variety.  They just need to polish the process."}
{"text":"Food is good  and a lot of different options. But the service is sooooo slow. We were in when the restaurant opened at 11 and no one was in front of us it took 22 minutes to get out order.  They seem to be lacking a lot of help."}
{"text":"Parking sucks.  Food is kind of mediocre.  Guacamole and Chips is over $5 bucks barely any guacamole in the cup.  Ordered seafood tacos waited forever.  Going back to Chipotle."}
{"text":"I have been to uberrito a few times. I enjoyed the first time but then after the food just never tasted as good as when they first open. The last time I went a coworker joined me; we both got food poisoning and had to miss the next day of work. I also ate outside enjoying the misters on the patio when a few of the workers came out and started smoking weed and selling it.  So unless you want to get second hand smoke and sick I suggests chipotle."}
{"text":"I love the concept, but gotta be honest, chipotle is better. There are tons of options but I feel like the quality is lacking. They may be better off doing fewer things right. I got a fish taco bowl and wouldn't get it again. The atmosphere is great and oddly enough I loved the fountain drink cups."}
{"text":"Really, it's a 3 1/2 star. Above average, but not quite GOOD! Uberito has ok, quick service, nice interior, food good for price. Missing a taco order, but hubby had a huge nacho that even he couldn't finish. My shrimp taco that I did get was tasty. Glad we tried new location."}
{"text":"Went to try this restaurant when I didn't want to hassle with trying The Doughbird. I will stick to Chipotle's. I tried the salad and they have a few more items to put on it than Chipotle's but they were all lacking in flavor. Even the meat was lacking in seasoning and it could have been any type of meat because both that I tried tasted much the same. The girl that helped me was very nice and helpful but when I asked for extra dressing, another girl piped in that I could only have 2 small containers. Not enough at all and it was watered down so it was sitting in the bottom of the salad instead of on it. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Feeling pretty cool that I'm writing the first review. Anyways, this place is freaking delicious! Their meats have great flavor and I love how many toppings you can choose from. Tonight they did a grand opening special, $2.99 for a burrito, drink, and cookie. All of the staff was very friendly. 

I will most certainly come back here and would recommend to anyone looking for some flavorful grub!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both got sick after eating here. Too many options on the menu. Some of the items sit out for a longgggg time. Perfect storm for bacteria."}
{"text":"The food is great but don't bother planning to call your order in and pick it up. We (large Drs office) called in 30 min prior and waited 40 minutes for them to get it together once we got there. NOTHING labeled and all the orders were mixed together in several boxes and the food was cold by now. 

We tried again to make a pick up order again today and they told us 40 min for 5 orders and that if we wanted it faster we would have to come in and make them ourselves but 40 min is how long it takes to make 5 taco orders. 
ARE YOU FREAKING ME?  

This place is highly disappointing and has a really poor system for pick up orders. I CAN ONLY EXPECT THAT IT WILL GET WORSE ONCE ONLINE ORDERING IS AVAILABLE."}
{"text":"Uberrito... I've had my eye on you for quite some time.  You popped up in Arcadia and also in Scottsdale on Tatum and Shea.  I finally had the perfect opportunity to try you when my sister suggested we have Mexican for lunch on a recent Monday.

At the time, we were closer to the Tatum and Shea location, so I headed that way first... only to find a sign on the window that said that the Scottsdale location had closed it's doors.  Bum bum... bummer.  Over to Arcadia I went; at least they would be open and pleased to serve me; or so I thought.

I parked and walked in with excitement, ready to check out this Tex Mex fast casual place with a large order to-go.  The greeting I received was underwhelming... No \"welcome to Uberrito\" -- no \"hello\" or \"have you been here before?\" or \"what can we get started for you today?\"  Instead it was a pressured meat or seafood question. Well, I was ordering a taco, 2 salads, a couple of tortillas, a quesadilla, and some nachos.  We had looked at the menu online in advance and my sister wanted the \"Two Timer\" (Seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, & shredded cheese drizzled with sour cream in a crispy taco shell, wrapped in a flour tortilla, spread with refried beans).  Well, strike 2 (or is it 3 at this point? )  This location didn't offer that option and the girl working there looked at me like I was crazy, saying \"we don't have a Two-Timer on the menu.\"  

Instead, I ordered my sister the \"Sloppy Cowboy\" (Shredded beef mixed with grilled potatoes and onions, topped with shredded cheese, drizzled with smoky chile de árbol salsa & serrano ranch on a flour tortilla).  Needless to say, it was not a hit.

I made my way down the assembly line and told another employee what toppings to add to the salads, and when I got to the end and went to pay, I asked for some salsa on the side.  You would have thought I asked for sushi at a Mexican restaurant or that my request was super high maintenance based on the response.  

Employee: \"What kind would you like?  We have seven kinds.\"  
Me: \"I'd like two medium, two hot, and two mild, please\"
Employee: \"Two of each?\"  (while rolling his eyes).
Me: \"Yes, please.  Unless you have a better suggestion.\" 
Note: There was no offer of a signature salsa, or a recommendation based on our order.
I received my order and was not shocked to find that we were short a salsa and that one spilled all over the bag.

I probably should have noticed the pattern in previous reviews about the unfriendly attitudes and poor service at this restaurant... It's definitely something that could use some work.  The nachos, quesadilla and salads were fine as I added toppings that were to our liking, but based on service alone, I will not be returning to this restaurant anytime soon.  There are plenty of other moderately priced Mexican restaurants in the Valley who will appreciate your business far more than it appears this place does."}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious here! I also am a big fan of their chips and guacamole. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Corporate chain restaurant a la Chipotle, plus some additional options.  Been there twice....

1st visit: New staff keeping up pretty well with the high volume but still working out the kinks a bit when I was there. Just opened so that's to be expected. I'll go back because it's convenient and I can build my own tasty monster burrito for a pretty good price. 3 stars. 

2nd visit: Service and value were great. Meat was way way too salty. Too salty to taste and We probably won't go back for that reason.  Bummer. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Okay I was skeptical walking in sounds like a greasy Mexican join but it is just like Chipotle except better! They have many burritos a vegan meat option and tons of fresh vegetables to stuff in the burrito along with 4 different tortilla types! Love This place! I would love to know if their Spanish rice has MSG no one could answer that question for me?!"}
{"text":"Food had good flavor, but I feel like I paid too much for the amount I received. I ordered a chicken bowl, hardly any rice, very little toppings, and a trace of queso-which cost me $1.39 extra. Disappointing. Maybe I'll give this place one more chance, but I certainly wasn't impressed today."}
{"text":"My food was good and Service was also good which is the only reason I am giving 2 stars. My issue is that as we were having lunch there was an uberrito employee also having lunch nearby us.  She was having a FaceTime conversation with someone and she was cussing a lot and even dropping F bombs many times. I find this very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I really think this place was a let down and does not live up to the hype. My chicken burrtio bowl was okay at best. Side by side I would not be able to tell the difference between Uberrito and Chipotle. The toppings that did separate Uberrito and Chipotle (jicama slaw, cilantro, different salsas) are given in such small quantities that they don't make a difference. They have a tablespoon as a 'scoop' and you get one tablespoon! I was pretty excited to try this place because of the so called variety, but found everything to be mediocre. 

My coworkers and I went on the last day of the $5 deal and with a line out the door, customer service was nonexistent. The line was slow and the servers mixed up our burritos/bowls multiple times. Looks like they need some practice on the line! It was our first time there and out of 6 of us separately paying, not one server told us our combo meal came with a cookie. (By the way, the bowls were not $5 and ended up being $9 when you add a regular drink.) Drink station is also pretty boring... 5 or 6 soda types plus iced tea. 

Overall, I would say skip! Nothing exciting or new going on here."}
{"text":"Seriously I wish this wasn't a thing because I'm going to be poor soon. Sautéed spinach and mushrooms as a topping won me over. They also have this spicy avocado dressing that is to die for I could just put it in a cup and drink it. 9.9/10 (lack of the .1 because, like chipotle, guac is extra)"}
{"text":"I'm super shocked by the 3.5 star rating of this place! This is as really cool spot. To start, it's basically a revamped Chipotle, where it's an assembly line type thing. What I really love about this place over Chipotle is that they have MUCH more options when it comes to the add ins. You can also get different sizes of bowls and stuff.

The decor is bright and colorful, a lot of green going on, modern seating, and a big grass-looking wall that has a huge \"Uberrito\" sign so you know where you are (if you didn't by now). As I said, the ordering area is set up just like Chipotle, if you like the quick assembly line thing. The big glass wall to separate the food is elongated enough for people who are vertically challenged (me) to have a better view of everything without tip toeing! I've now been here twice and the staff has been welcoming both times, smiling and informative for first timers.

Let's not forget the food, of course! They have burritos, tacos, bowls, salads, and sides. I've gotten the vegan picadillo bowl and the Off-the-Hook fish tacos, and what a treat each time! The vegan option comes with mushrooms, tofu, potatoes and some veggies. The food is fresh and very flavorful. I love the plethora of add in options like cabbage, cilantro, lime, onion, etc.. They even have 4 different types of tortillas for burritos!

Overall, quality place. I see this as my new go to \"Chipotle\" spot."}
{"text":"I want this place to be better then it is. The service is atrocious. Very chaotic for such a simple concept. The staff need retraining there are so many workers and still can't get food out smoothly."}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat \"fast food\" Mexican. I love the chips and guacamole. The burritos are good and a nice portion. I don't like the ordering process and the menu could be explained better. It's like a production type line and I need more time to decide. I feel rushed and think they could use a menu that tells you what choices you have for ingredients to place on your burrito before you order. 
Clean interior and clean bathrooms. Outdoor area to dine outside is small but adequate. Decent parking. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit but if in the area an overall good choice."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! The burritos are amazing! The kids ask for it all the time! Every time we have been there we have had a great experience that we have felt the need to tell the manager. With 2 little kids it can be overwhelming trying to order burritos for everyone, who all want different toppings, and not feel hated by the employees! I have not been back to a Chipotle since finding Uberrito!"}
{"text":"I'm eating my first Uberrito bowl as I type this...
To get to the point, the bowl is pretty good but my experience at the restaurant left more to be desired. Now I'll expand.

There was no one else in line. Upon walking up to the counter, I was greeted and asked what meat I wanted. I hesitated because I wasn't sure and had never been here before. My hesitation was followed by, \"Not seafood though, right?\" So I thought to myself 'I guess not...' even though people's pics of the shrimp bowl looked pretty good. I opted for chicken and went down the line, which is quite similar to Chipotle. I felt rushed by the gal even though there was no one in front of me...
As you can see in the photo, the portion looks pretty small, especially when compared to Chipotle. I also got spinach, and there was minimal. The Chipotle aioli is delicious! My bowl tastes good, but I wish there had been more, especially for the price ($9 as I got some avocado), though I guess I could've gotten rice to add more volume. 
Another thing that turned me off was when they were out of forks, I asked for more. A gentleman walked out from the back, opened the cabinet under the countertop, grabbed a plastic bin of forks, and started putting them into the plasticware container with no gloves on, handling all parts of the forks including the tines/prongs that we put in our mouths. 

The food was good, the service and portion size were  lacking. Next time I think I'll just go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place three time now and had a bad service and food experience. Service is slow and the people look less than thrilled to be there. 1st time service was just all around bad and they were rude. The 2nd time I had tortilla soup and it was cold. I let the guy walking around know It was cold and could it get warmed and he said ya I'm sorry and walked away. The 3rd visit same bad service and then the guy in the back preparing the food continually wiped his snotty nose on his hand and arm while preparing the food. At that point I walked out. 3td time was not a charm. It's quite sad because it's right near my house but I just can't do it again."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch from this location for my staff because I had excellent service and good experience at their Shea location always. But the phoenix location on Indian School is just the opposite. We ordered $200 worth food and not a single order was correct with 2 orders completely missing. None of the burritos had meat. When we tried calling the store and spoke to the manager: Greg, he hung up on us saying that the Door Dash did not relay the correct order. It's not their fault. Seriously!? Worst service everrrrrrrrrrrrrr"}
{"text":"First, the service here is ALWAYS terrible. It must be a requirement to be a complete asshole who hates the idea of working and -god forbid - attempting decent customer service. Bonus: they literally forget items for my to-go order everytime. Like - I must be on a hidden camera show or something because it's so ridiculous how awful they are. But... the tacos were good enough to suffer through the hassle of ordering them. Until this past Wednesday when we tried to call in an order and they said they've eliminated items from the menu without warning?! Shrimp and Tofu? But two days later I checked the website and everything's still there.  Are. You. KIDDING ME? Either someone forgot to update the MENU or I underestimated how incompetent the staff is.... 
Go to Chipotle. Seriously. Especially if they just hacked their menu items for real."}
{"text":"Went here on national burrito day so needless to say it was packed but they did their best to get everyone moved through the line as fast as possible . I enjoyed a salad but would like to see more dressing options. Food was fresh and yummy. The man checking us out even threw in free chips and salsa for the long wait."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight. The decor and restaurant was very clean and modern. I feel like I'm a fat American going to complain about portion sizes, but I think Chipotle ruined me. My bowl was only half full, not work the $8. Food was fresh but kind of cold. Most likely a 1 time try for me."}
{"text":"Please note the time. It's 3 minutes to close and we were denied service! And we weren't alone, others also desired fresh mex and were denied. Never been and very very sad."}
{"text":"First time I was there this place was great. It was just myself on my lunch break. I ordered a burrito and loved it. So fresh! I went there again about a week ago with my family for my birthday. I wanted to show them this new burrito spot. Not as good. My burrito was good but my wife and kids order took forever. It took more than 20 minutes for tacos and a kids quesadilla. I was done with my food before they go there food. Ordered guacamole to find out they didn't have any available?!? I want to try this place again but not sure what I am going to get..."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy and refreshing! I'm not a huge chipotle fan and I have to admit I was kind of nervous because I thought is was basically the same. That's a negative ghost rider! Everything was so light, fresh, and delicious! I love the different size options and filling options. Their kids menu is bomb.com as well! I'm so excited they are next to my house and work. YAY for great food!"}
{"text":"Lord have mercy.. Took a chance/tried something new: What a mistake! Walked into \"Ubarferrito\" for the 1st time & prayed for the best, but I was highly disappointed & left just as hungry as I was when I walked in. I liken this experience to paying all this money to see Beyonce & walking into this gorgeous amphitheatre, but then the curtain goes up & instead of seeing Beyonce it ends up being some random broad that Simon kicked off Season 1 of American Idol.. At first you see all these ingredients & it looks like a winner, but once you get done waiting for your burrito you realize that it's all for show. Interesting to see certain people on here bragging about how the \"owner\" handed them coupons during their visit & asked them how their meal was: This DEFINITELY didn't happen during my visit, as the supposed \"owner\" was instead socializing with one random person & too busy being anti-social with everyone else. HMM, maybe you have to fit a certain \"demographic\" in order to get the \"white glove\" service here? Who knows, but read on to see why I couldn't care less at this point.

For starters, the portion sizes they give you are absolutely pathetic.. I ordered a shrimp burrito, a side of guacamole & a regular drink.. As another Yelp user noted, the sour cream is in a freaking BOTTLE (wtf, seriously?) & by the time I got to that part of the line the girl literally had to squeeze it like a damn toothpaste pouch just to get a halfway decent amount of sour cream into my burrito (an amount that STILL wasn't even remotely close to the amount I wanted).. As I asked for the side of guacamole, they acted as if they were unsure whether or not a customer was actually allowed to get guacamole on the side (even though the idiots have the cups for it sitting right there next to the container that holds the guacamole), and once one girl finally convinced another that I was allowed to get my guac on the side (after telling her that they would be charging me extra for it), the amount they finally gave me didn't even fill the cup they placed it in (there was LITERALLY space on all 4 sides of the amount of guac they put in there).. Mind you, you're already on the \"stingy\" side of things when you get something on the side as the cups for \"sides\" aren't even 4oz (aka- the size of the \"side\" cups at Chipotle [which ALWAYS get filled to the top every time I visit]): The \"side\" cups at \"Ubarferrito\" seriously aren't even 2oz. Should have walked out once I saw that, but I decided to hang on in there since I was soo hungry. I got my drink cup, paid, took a number & grabbed a table only to come across yet another disappointment.

I ONLY ordered a drink once I saw that lemonade was one of the options (all the other options are carbonated or caffeinated, neither of which I will drink)... As luck would have it, I got up to the drink machine & came to learn that the ONE drink I wanted was out, & instead of receiving a cup full of lemonade (from the spout that is CLEARLY labeled \"lemonade\") I received a cup full of plain old WATER.. Yeah, they fixed it after I got back up & waited for several more people to order so I could tell the cashier, but by then I was already turned off... \"Let's just hope the burrito is good\" I said to myself.. Surprise, surprise, yet ANOTHER disappointment!!

I was thinking the burrito would be delicious & fresh, since they literally make you wait for them to grill the shrimp. Well this random/sloppy guy who was behind the counter (presumably the \"owner\") walks up with my tray, sits it on my table, takes my number off the table, says absolutely nothing & walks off.. Terrible experience up to this point, but by now i'm starving, so I dig in.. The burrito was salty, bland, totally lacking in any depth of flavor whatsoever (with truly pathetic portions across the board [especially as far as the shrimp]), & the guacamole was the worst I think I have EVER had (which says alot, as i'm definitely not the best cook but can say that even MY guacamole puts that crap to shame).. Just a total disappointment, probably greater than ANY other disappointment I have EVER had as far as the food spots in this area.

The cashier was snobby (as was the person who brought my tray over), the service was lacking altogether & the food quality/portion was a joke. The TRUTH: I expect so much more, especially when i'm spending $13 of my hard-earned cash on this disgusting crap that you just gave me. Wish I could get my money back, but lesson learned. BOTTOM LINE: STICK WITH WHAT YOU KNOW (especially when hungry). Yeah, I might pay close to the same amount at Chipotle, but i'm OK with that when I know i'm getting better service/portions & MUCH better flavor/quality (since the entire goal is to walk out of there FULL). Good luck to the folks who are stupid enough to read this review yet still subject themselves to this overpriced/overrated trash (& may GOD forgive those who have the NERVE to come on here & claim \"It's Chipotle\" in their review)."}
{"text":"It's Chipotle....with expanded choices and combinations and with employees who are perhaps pushing a little to hard to be friendly and chatty and happy.  

Still.  The value was good and so was the burrito."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and developed food poisoning. I had a white flour burrito with shredded beef, peppers/onions, cheese, sour cream, roasted corn, green salsa, and avocado. The first few bites didn't taste or smell right. I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery and they took too long to process the order. The portions are to small considering the prices and the appearance is questionable. They did not add straw, napkins and utensils so I couldn't even eat the food I ordered."}
{"text":"All I know is the 'Tree Hugger' (vegetarian taco) is one of the best things I've ever eaten! I'm not even a vegetarian. Their sauces are phenomenal. The 'off the hook' (fish taco) is also great."}
{"text":"All around pretty good.  Nothing stands out as amazing, but for a quick lunch spot it has more variety and options than Chipotle.  I eat here fairly often though so it keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing staff. Great bonus reward program as well! So over other places that are similar to this that has lost the \"taste value\" and amount of food you receive for the cost."}
{"text":"Never will my boyfriend and I ever go back to chipotle !!! I can't wait to get payed so I can come back to this place I gotta be sure to try everything on the menu at some point in time"}
{"text":"Tried this the other day on my way home from work, glad I made the stop. Some what busy, place smelled fresh, staff was friendly and informative. The food was fresh and tasty, looking forward to my next visit. *****"}
{"text":"I'd say try it for yourself! I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. I got a shredded beef burrito on a spinach tortilla. It tasted great! I also enjoyed a cookie as well. Overall I felt that this place is way better than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Bingo bango! 

Delicious and quick!


After reading mixed reviews I was hesitant to try Uberrito, but since it went in right down the street and I am a fan of create your own bowls/burritos I couldn't pass it up. We were greeted promptly and ordered 3 regular bowls; one with pork, one with chicken, and one with shredded beef. They had an extremely efficient line of friendly staff who quickly and competently passed our bowls down the line and put in whatever we wanted. There are so many options, and it all looked incredible. My favorite that other places don't usually offer are the mushrooms, they blend so well with the shredded beef and other flavors. They also have a variety of sauces that the competition does not offer and they really enhance the flavors. I expected it to be a somewhat tedious and slow process due to the fact that they just opened and might not have all the kinks out, but I was pleasantly surprised when we blew threw the line and got exactly what we wanted in a timely manner. 

We took our food to go and enjoyed every bite of it at home. Each bowl was good, and we all agreed we were fans! The only knock I have is that they are a bit chintzy on the meat portions, but if you ask politely they will add a little more. Along with make your own items to order they also have various tacos you can mix and match and chips/salsa etc. The atmosphere was clean and inviting, and when the weather is nice they have a great little patio area to enjoy as well. 

Uberrito is a great addition to the neighborhood; I will be a frequent customer for sure."}
{"text":"I\"ve been several times now, and I can say that the products are tasty and fresh - and guacamole is one of those things that absolutely must be served fresh.  Uberrito does not let you down in this respect.

I typically go with a bowl, and a couple of times I've added one or two tacos.  I have to say the tacos were just kinda meh, but the bowls are always good.  It's the typical serving line where you tell the server what to put in the bowl.  

I've found the ingredients to be fresh and tasty and prices are reasonable.  There is a nice, clean dining room, and a small patio outside with a gas fireplace.  It would be a nice place to have a quiet meal.

Service OTOH, for me has been kinda spotty.  I don't expect to be best buddies with the service people, but I do expect a smile when I'm greeted, and at least be congenial.  My last visit, every employee in the place, while providing adequate service, had a sour expression and appeared to be just doing their job while wishing they were somewhere else.  It was really off-putting.  I mean I thought maybe it was me, I didn't feel so well, but afterward, both my wife and daughters mentioned the same thing.

Clearly, at least on this night, there were morale issues.  I feel sorry for the unhappy people, but I also don't want to frequent a place with unhappy people.  I hope maybe they will fix this before I come back, because I know what it is like working someplace you don't want to be.  If you don't want to be there, neither do I.

Would I go back?  Currently on the fence."}
{"text":"Great food. I'd say this place is much better than Chipotle with the better quality in food and more variety. 

I also love the $5 chicken burritos on Mondays. Great deal! 

The staff is also very friendly and the vibe is great. 

You're probably wondering - why 3 stars? It's the wait time. This place needs a lot of work on how to work their line efficiently. I saw so many areas that need improvement. Too much standing around waiting for something to happen. 

I'd like to continue coming back, but not if I have to wait as long as I did (roughly 10 minutes with 2 people in front of me)."}
{"text":"This place is very similar to chipotle with a better selection. Maybe I'm not the biggest fan of places like this in general but I thought it was very average. I would give this place a 3.5 because it did have an amazing selection of add on's but nothing really stuck out to me for me to give it more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"I'd give them a 4 1/2 but I cant. Its really good. Only reason its less than a 5 is because Ive had better mexican food. But for what it is(a chipotle style burrito shop), its worth more than 3.5 or even 4 stars. Fresh and tasty, not bland. Plus the monday chicken burrito/bowl for 5 dollars is an outrageously great deal. They dont skimp on it, its a full size bowl or burrito. Very filling, great variety of additions and sauces/salsas. Thoroughly impressed, will be back."}
{"text":"It's similar set up to chipotle, but they have more options. It can be a little overwhelming if it's your first time. The steak was cooked well and the salsas have good flavor. They also have options of fresh veggies ex. Diced red onion, jalapeños, etc."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time tonight at the recommendation of the girl at the Dutch Bros drive-thru. 

The food is awesome. You can choose from a taco, bowl, nachos, and more. There are a TON of options, including Spanish rice. They have more toppings than I can count and a lot of different salsa options. Highly recommend the Spicy Avocado.  It absolutely blows Chipotle out of the water. They also serve Coke products (more specifically, Mr Pibb) which is becoming more and more rare. Everyone is going to Pepsi and that's a huge turnoff for me. The pricing is also good. We got 2 bowls with tons of toppings, a taco, chips and salsas, and two drinks for $24. 

The service is slow, which was the reason for the 4 stars. I'm not sure if its because they are newer and still working out the kinks, or that's just how they roll. It was crowded at 8pm on a Sunday night. So if you are looking to get in and out in 5 minutes, this isn't your place. The food is very good though and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm hooked -- definitely a better choice for me than Qdoba and Chipotle.  They have regular bowls (BIG) and mini bowls (smaller than a regular bowl at Q or C).  Also burritos and a wide range of tacos.  What makes them different is the lime squeeze, the fresh cilantro, the additional choices of proteins, more salsas, two types of cheese, $5 chicken bowl Mondays, and I was served by THE happiest staff (at least in this location) so I'm definitely coming back here.  Fresh, fresh, fresh...."}
{"text":"First time here. So good. The workers are patient. Give the guy props for dealing with a complicated customer that wanted service RIGHT AWAY while he was making someone else's food . ONLY thing. Menu is kinda confusing. Everything else was great."}
{"text":"Come try a chicken burrito or bowl on Monday for only 5 dollars.  Great deal,  fresh ingredients.  Cute little cozy place,  friendly staff and of course great fast tasty food."}
{"text":"The staff was wonderfully friendly and the food was fantastic. What a great experience. I will be back"}
{"text":"My order was supposed to be dairy free given my childrens' allergies. When I got home, everything was covered in dairy so I had to return it. When I got home again I found they didn't put 1/2 of my order in the bag, so back again. Not even a real apology, so never going back."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Scottsdale and won't be coming back to this location based on a better experience at Scottsdale. 

The food is good. More choices than chipotle, clean, and has an outdoor fire place. Nice set up. 

The service on the other hand, was less spectacular. My husband went first and had a good experience with his burrito. I had to wait for one of 3 people standing around bored to come take my order. The boy that helped looked like he hated being there and lacked any knowledge of what was in front of him. I told him what I wanted and he was surprised that they had that item. The burrito was runny and was very small compared to my husbands. 

Chalk it up to him being possibly new, but he lacked the ability to care in front of customers. My husband paid for our meals while I was still asking for queso (beginning of the line). 

Lastly, the cookies may have been from another day - hard as rocks today. 

Otherwise, I'll still be going to the Scottsdale location as we still like Uberrito."}
{"text":"Just went there for dinner we got the $5 memorial day special. We got the pork nachos the young man Dylan is  amazing he is passionate about building you a great plate. Last Monday I had a $5 chicken bowl. That was the first time Dylan made my bowl it was picture perfect and tasty. Dylan has a great smile on his face while he is helping you. Thank you Dylan... UBurrito is lucky to have him on there team!!!"}
{"text":"What they lack in name recognition they make up in awful service. Three workers could not adequately serve three customers. The food is pretty good though."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Food is always delicious. I usually have to ask for more rice or chicken in a bowl tho. And the chips could benefit from a little salt, but otherwise, love it here! Also. The cookies are to die for!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I decided to stop in for lunch at this location. I have heard all the hype about Uberrito (my mother-in-law is a fan) but I never tried it. Immediately I ordered their grilled shrimp bowl and added my choice of toppings. This place is very similar to Chipotle and I love Chipotle. 
Everything tasted flavorful and fresh. I just wish they weren't so far away from my Downtown Phoenix office. If not, I would be going there more often.
I highly recommend for yelpers to try the Uberrito experience!"}
{"text":"First time I came here last month the workers were extremely helpful and nice, as it was my first time. Today I went there for lunch and it was like a whole different place. I had the help of a young gentleman who obviously didn't want to be there. He took a minute to even greet me as he was putting on his gloves, I couldn't hear a word he said or asked me and he just was rude, I almost left mid burrito. Undecided if I'll go back for a 3rd try. Food is alright,  but if I have to put up with rude service I'll stick to the many other burrito options around town."}
{"text":"Well I'm sure this had been said before but it's like chipotle but not as good, it's more expensive, and somehow smaller portions. When your burrito is 50% tortilla you've got a problem. The service was decent enough but slow. There are better places around so maybe spend your money there."}
{"text":"Nothing exciting, nor better than Chipotle. Food is already pre-made and it sits there all day long. Choices are bowl, tacos or burrito. I really didn't like the attitude of some employees here, as they looked at me very irritated that it was my first time. Well, it'll be my last time too. The only positive note: if you choose shrimp, then they cook them upon order."}
{"text":"Definitely a Chipotle vibe but on steroids (in a good way) to start there are multiple sizes and they can make anything you get nachos style. Four tortilla types, cod and shrimp in addition to steak shredded beef, carnitas vegan picadullo and chicken. Beans a few different ways. Probabbly ten different topping type options. The line crew even squeeze fresh lime juice on your burrito if you want. Great experience for my first time here. Just a warning all three of the spicy salsas have serious heat.... I had two of the three that weren't habanero but nose running and sweating happening as I type... And on my third cup of iced tea...."}
{"text":"Like this concept. Pretty much chipotle but newer/fresher, better location (pkg sux) & more reasonable..."}
{"text":"Very similar to chipotle in fact better than chipotle cause it has more options ! I'm from LA so we definitely need uberrito out here ! The flavors were really good and it's good quantity for good price!"}
{"text":"I love the food at this place, super fresh and spicy salsa which I love! What I don't love and why I am posting only 3 stars is because the 3 times I have been in here I have not had good customer service. The employees are walking around half of the time and have no idea what they are doing. Today for example there are three people in front of me and and two people are cleaning and one guy is just standing there, the girl had to ask him what he was doing because he wasn't checking people out at the register and he wasn't finishing people's food. Then the girl asks the other guy if he will cash people out and he goes, \"no I'm cleaning\". The customer is ALWAYS FIRST. You all really need to work on the customer service and URGENCY. but good food."}
{"text":"I had been to their other location on Shea Blvd several times. I agree with the other reviews this place is like an improved/Über (BTW Über means super in german) chipotle. You can get your entree as a burrito, salad, bowl or over nachos. The had 3 or 4 kinds of tortilla wraps. Fish, shrimp, steak, chicken, pork and some vegan things I never pay any attention to for proteins. For fillings they have 2 rice choices, 3 types of beans, sauteed mushrooms and spinach, grilled peppers and onions, and about 30 other things, plus many sauces.  It has many more selection/choices and fresher food than chipolte making for a much better product. The lines people talk about are because it's new and they offered all their rewards customers coupons for a free entree with a $2.99 soda and cookie combo purchase. I think the lines will be shorter soon if they aren't already. To give you an example of how many opening giveaways they made, I have been there four times since it opened having fish, shrimp, steak and chicken and have not paid full price yet. Due to all the food and toppings choices you could go everyday for weeks before repeating. For a fast food restaurant this is 5 star food."}
{"text":"Meh, The food is average and it is a cafeteria style place. I guess it is okay in a pinch."}
