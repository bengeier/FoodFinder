{"text":"The best pizza we've had in a very long time!  We ordered delivery and the delivery time was great, especially considering we don't live to close.  The crust is so tasty and the toppings were very generous and amazing.  For traditional pizza, I can't imagine better than this.  We will definitely be regulars at Gordo's Pizza from now on."}
{"text":"solid 4.5 out of 5.  Just moved to the area and decided to try Gordo's based on yelp reviews - service is awesome and the pizza is very flavorful (I think I even saw them shaving their own ham on site). They have decent 2-4-1 deals and it's the best pizza in that neighborhood area for sure!"}
{"text":"This was our first time getting pie here, and we ventured over for YYC Pizza Week. The staff/owners were SO friendly, and we chatted with them during our wait. It's always great to support a local family business. We also ordered their \"crossbones,\" a clever name for garlic cheese bread. The pizza was amazeballs. How can you go wrong with macaroni and cheese, bacon, and a solid amount of spice? We devoured the pizza in one sitting, and I'm glad they deliver all over NW Calgary, because we will be back for more."}
{"text":"Love this pizza, esp. The GF pizza... Couldn't even tell.  Clean area, friendly staff.  We come back often. The only thing I hate about this place is the location, buts still worth coming back for despite the location."}
{"text":"This was my 5th or 6th time getting pizza from Gordos, the difference this time was that I went to pick up rather than my wife.   I always am wary of going to a place that you get food from, as I am a picky clean eats type.  Perhaps a dirty counter, piled up pizza boxes above the sink that look like they have been there for years too long, greasy tile floor,   perhaps questionable advertising on a bulletin board.   No my freinds there was none of that. It was simply one of the cleanest and best organized places I have seen in this part of Calgary. My italian mother would be hard pressed to find an issue with cleanliness here.  On top of that, I was greeted by 2 of the nicer people I have met in a while,  so much so they gave my daughter a tour and one of they owners was kind enough to answer some questions and tell me some history.  I thought the Pirate pizza to be one of the best I have had in Calgary, and to meet the makers it is easy to understand why. Awesome people, awesome pizza.    This place has it going on.  Well organized, filled with passion for food, and a touch of kindness that you do not find that often.  Oh, and the price is a sweet point to. All around 5 stars . Top notch."}
{"text":"the motherclucker was motherclucking no-sauce.  just NO-SAUCE.  totez no-sauce.  the pirate was 1/2 way decent.  The price of 30$ for some pizza that isnt too much of anything id a big letdown.  for 10$ more you can get 16 gigantic slices from senoires..  I thought i'd give them a chance, its a leg up from pizza73, but still dissapointing"}
{"text":"Shit pizza rude driver and prick of an owner. Garbage absoulte garbage one of the worst pizzas ive ever had sauce was disgusting and meat was old and cheese was awful"}
{"text":"Ok , so I waited to order it the second time just to make sure I'm not dreaming ...It is soooo good !! Just order it ! You won't regret ;) As a vegan , I don't have a lot of options ( or should I say none :/ ) when I eat outside , but a couple of friends recommended and I fell in love .. I ordered the deep dish garden of eaten . The dough was amazing , the veggies were fresh , the cheese was daya ( vegan friendly ) and I enjoyed every bite ! And the high light - the cheesy bread !! Omg ! So good ! Good job Gordon's ! See you soon !"}
{"text":"supervisor ordered few pizza for our team. Some of us liked the vegi one the most coz we thought the ones with meats were too salty. Especially the 'all meat' one. And my stomach didn't feel well after eating them."}
