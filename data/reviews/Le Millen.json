{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We had the tasting menu and everything we had was divine, from the foie gras to the crème brûlée... but the sweetbreads were the pièce de résistance. Unfortunately, the service was lacking. Our server forgot to bring our Trou Normand, but we only realized at the very of our meal. 

The place is small and cozy, so I would suggest making a reservation beforehand. And don't forget to BYOB! I definitely recommend Le Millen to anyone who loves French cuisine."}

{"text":"Newly opened BYOW place in the less visited and restaurant crowed east end. 
We went on a whim for a casual Saturday night out. And this place is just that, a good spot for a casual night out. 
The decor is very simple yet welcoming, almost too much so at times as the proximity of the tables will have you engaging with your neighbours spontaneously. 

The menu is modernized French fare, offering either a tasting of 5 courses or an a la carte of the same items. Some novelty in the plates as ingredients not usually seen together are worked to create harmony. Quail with scampi AND veal? Duck and calamari?! As odd as some of these combinations might seem, they actually worked out pretty well together. 
Another plus of this place was that the bread was on point! Served warm and crunchy with room temperature butter. We had 3 baskets.... 
We probably also ended up having three baskets of bread because unfortunately the portions for the mains were quite small and left us on our appetite. 

Overall an enjoyable night. Not a place I would visit on a regular basis but I'd definitely come back to try again if they keep their menu updated."}
{"text":"Overall great BYOB restaurant experience.  I took the tasting menu with the amuse-bouche, scallops, trou normand, veal and langoustine, and pistachio creme brulee.  ($77 before tip)

Service: Nothing special.  The waiter was not terrible with english, but could have done better.  The menu was also french only which was a little annoying. (3/5)

Atmosphere/decor: Restaurant was very minimalistic for the quality of food.  I felt as if I were eating at a chain take-out eatery with plastic chairs.  (1/5)

Amuse-bouche: Bison tartar with asparagus, and crispy bread all seasoned with paprika.  Excellent taste, nothing to add (5/5).

Scallops: Scallops with pancetta, corn mash, spinach, and caramelized popcorn.  Scallops were on the small side which was disappointing and the caramelized popcorn was unnecessary and detracted from the flavor (3/5)

Trou Normand:  grapefruit sorbet with vodka.  Very interesting in the fact that the sweetness of the grapefruit mellowed out the vodka.  I am not a big fan of the hard liquor and did not see the point of this, but it is traditional so I will rate it objectively (4/5).  It would have been perfect if the alcohol was completely hidden since the point is to \"aid in digestion\".

Veal and langoustine: veal with langoustine, smoked lard foam, onions, spinach, red cabbage and vinegar purree.  Everything in this dish just worked even without a grain.  (5/5)

Pistachio Creme Brulee: Delcious, but nothing special.  (3/5).

Bread:  Bread (nothing special) at the table was sometimes cold and sometimes \"fresh\" and warm. I don't understand why the bread was not always warm.  The chive butter was superb (3/5)

For the price I paid for the tasting menu, I definitely got my money's worth in terms of the ingredients and the superb plating.  I have some grievances here and there, but I hope this new restaurant will keep on improving and continue to put out its great food.  (3.5/5 overall)"}
{"text":"So I have decided to play a little game and choose a random neighborhood of Montreal and the first restaurant that could pique my interest. And voilà! Ahuntsic was the lucky card and this restaurant was randomly selected based on my Yelper curiosity. And oh boy did I make a great choice! It was easy to make a reservation and from the arrival to this restaurant the service was pleasant and friendly. Their food is delish, yes it was worth 30 something minute trip from Plateau to Le Millen. It's a BYOB restaurant which is great because bringing your favorite bottle or bottles is always a good thing. Their tartare is yammy and overall the whole experience left me satisfied. So yes, if you're looking to expand your horizons and step out outside of your neighborhood, then you should definitely consider checking out this place. You may just be surprised."}
