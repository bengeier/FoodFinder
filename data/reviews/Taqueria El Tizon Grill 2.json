{"text":"Al Pastor carved off the spit. Got it a little too early and it wasnt very crispy yet but I will be back to try that again when Im in town. Chorizo and egg burrito was good. Carne Asada tacos really good...They serve whole beans on top, which reminds me of the way my friend's dad used to make them in the middle of the desert, cooking over a campfire."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 carne Asada Burritos. Meat was bland & BURNT! Will never go here again!! I would not have spent as much as I did on a burrito I could NOT finish because of how disgusting it was! Took it to go otherwise would have took one bite & asked for my money back."}
{"text":"It's whatever. Wouldn't come back, pastor has a good flavor but it is dry, hard, and cold. It had looked like if it was sitting for awhile, maybe it was the time I went but it was around 730pm and they were busy which was surprising. Food just isn't the same as back when they recently opened, it was the place I'd always go and now food is dry, and the rice and beans aren't good and have no flavor. The salsas aren't authentic, it's like a robertos but a bit better but not as good as other taco places. Tacos should be greasy or at least the tortillas somewhat, but these were dry, just not satisfied. Try someplace else."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMM Their steak huaraches are delicious!  The tortillas they use taste homemade (according to my gf).  I'm so glad we randomly found this place.  It was the best meal we had during our entire vegas trip.  Wow Derek Rose is amazing! MVP! Go Bulls!  (sorry watching the Bulls/Knicks game)"}
{"text":"Great place!  Tacos de carne asada are always delicious and reasonably priced, can never go wrong!  Coming from California I was searching for a Good taco spot and this place takes the gold medal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, good sized portions and great prices. I've been going here for over a year and have never been disappointed with my order."}
{"text":"Grilled onions! This looks like a familia owned Carne asada joint.  A place you would normally drive by & miss.  It's worth to make that turn into the shopping center & stop for the Carne asada.  They have many dish options, legit authentic mexican dishes.  I finally settled for  the Carne asada plate after looking at the menu for a good 5 minutes.  Everything looked good.   Two people can easily eat out of one plate.  The Carne asada was very good & tasty.  Had that char taste as if you just barbqued it outside.  I felt like I was eating at my madres house.  My niece swears by the caramel grilled onions in the salsa bar.  She gives this place 5 stars just for the onions. This place is legit.    We do Plan on coming back to try the other menu items. I keep reading about the el pastor from other Yelp reviewers.  This one is a keeper when you cant light up the BBQ.  Oh beans are legit too."}
{"text":"Mexican food usually tastes pretty similar from one restaurant to another to me unless it's really good or bad. Everyone seems to have one thing that sets them apart.  Since this was my first time here, I don't know what that is yet here, but what I can say is their sauces are amazing. Good hot sauce gets 5 start f from me."}
{"text":"i've never had al pastor like that in my life. i got an al pastor burrito w/ everything. overall my burrito was good but there was something up with that pastor. i think it was good, i'm not sure though. i might need to go back and try it again soon, haw! the rice stood out to me as the best part for sure. the guacamole was bad but not so bad i couldn't enjoy the burrito, i'll just skip it next time. they have a really good salsa bar with two reds, two greens and a big vat of sauteed onions. also, i saw a lot of people eating tortas. i'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick fix on one of my King's Ranch loops and it was pretty cool - I liked the outrageous color graphics that help draw in the hungry traveler. Very indigenous.  So the agua fresca; I'm always a sucker for Piña - they know how to buy and prep pineapples!     Loved the pastor tostada - went down pretty quick. I forgot the second item ordered so I'll just have to go back, reassess and report my findings."}
{"text":"Nastiest looking and smelling food I ever encountered.  My dog wouldn't even eat it.  Rude staff.  Filthy restaurant.  NEVER NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I don't know how someone can make guacamole that doesn't taste like avocado but he/she managed to do it!  The cook used too much lime juice.    The carne asada was overcooked.  The best thing about my meal was the beans."}
{"text":"Rude service. Guy working register was very rude and when I asked some questions he rolled his eyes. Maria the other cashier has a huge hickey on her neck very professional. The food was good but the service killed it for me."}
{"text":"Dependable, tasty tacos.   I've only eaten the carne asada and el pastor tacos. But I've had them both a number of times.  The carne asada is served with cilantro, onions, and refried beans. The addition of beans is different for me, but I enjoy them. Those tacos are solid. They are consistently enjoyable. Not earth shattering, but good.   The al pastor, on the other hand, is a different story. Sometimes it is \"good\". Tasty and pleasant. But there are times that their al pastor is AMAZING. I don't know what they are doing different on those days, but I plan to find out. I am not a fan of pork, but the taco filled with semi-sweet, perfectly charred tender meat served with pineapple is the best I've had in town. Again, they are not consistently outstanding, but they are always tasty. I would add an extra star if their pastor tacos were more consistent.   I am a fan of this local joint. Did I mention they have a self-serve bar with grilled onions and jalepenos? Delish.  EDITED TO ADD  IMPORTANT DISCOVERY: After eating here more than 20 times, I stumbled in a few times before the lunch rush. And guess what? The carne asada was amazing. Like award winning. Come in later (as I often have) and who knows what you'll get  (Ok to delicious fare). But come in around 11:00 AM,  and get ready to be moved. Possibly to tears. If they keep this up i may have to add a star....."}
{"text":"Limited menu, no bueno. If you want good tacos or burritos best to find a Roberto's near by"}
{"text":"I seen a roach I will never return this was my favorite Mexican spot. The bugs was crawling all by the outer counter and glass."}
{"text":"Oook...my husband and I have been here a few times and I would call it my new spot but last night I came across a baby roach crawling it's way around the salsa bar. Now, I understand and know that restaurants attract rodents bug isn't it the responsibility if the people who run these places make sure shit like that is taken care of?! I mean come on bro...\"yea can I get a burrito with sour cream, hold the roaches\" hell to the no. My husband will eat anything so I think he didn't mind rodent in his food and he said he thinks the roaches came from the kabob place next door lol! Either way, super gross. I don't know about anyone else but I will never return to eat here nor will I recommend it.."}
{"text":"The food was ok. My husband and I wanted 3 tacos each with sides of beans and rice. When we got home we only had rice and beans for one person. The tacos looked like there were just thrown into the styrofoam box. It was ok but I have had better."}
{"text":"The very best tacos ..........  have been to many places even in Mexico by far the best I have ever had   lots of lean meat and all the extras even beans 5 star."}
{"text":"Coming from LA this place feels like home and has the best carne asada! Mmmmmm and the al pastor aye dios...... I haven't tried this particular location but I'm a regular at the original one in North Las Vegas. The owners and staff are great! I think the cooks love us there ;-) thanks el tizon"}
{"text":"I've been eating at El Tizon for years. It's the best carne asada in Las Vegas. Many have tried but everyone has failed. Till someone lets me taste better. El Tizon #2 is really #1."}
{"text":"Affordable. Yummy. Authentic. Love this place.  If you tip give to them ,not in the box. Owner keeps tips from the box."}
{"text":"Ordered two carne asade tacos, and two al pastor. Both were awesome! The carne asade with everything came with beans which is different, but quite enjoyable. The al pastor came with slices of pineapple with gave the tacos a great sweet flavor. The salsa bar is on point and comes with grilled onions and chiles. Very great place. Will definitely come back when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible, food is over priced and expensive! I had the sopes and it was nothing special, very bland tasting and dry meats. There was flies throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"Antojo de tacos?...mmm!! Pues vamos al Tizon! He escuchado en la radio de esta taqueria,los tacos tienen buen sabor,tripa dorada mis favoritos,la prepararon como me gusta(súper dorada) todo estaba bien,hasta que...voy al baño y SORPRESA!!!....CUCARACHAS cocineras( Que ASCO) corriendo por todo el baño.Seguro que no vuelvo a esta taqueria. Ojo!!!...Si así está lo que veo,como estará lo que no veo???"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars for my carne asada nachos they were huge & the carne asada was so good. My husband loved his tacos AL pastor. I'm giving 2 stars for my kids quesadilla & rolled tacos had a lot better other places. The quesadilla was a single tortilla folded over not the 2 on top of each other that were used to and the cheese was different.. Also 2 stars for \"this place looks dirty\" my 9 year Olds exact words. It needs so updating. It just looks old and dirty. Not what you want to be looking at when your eating.  All in all I was satisfied with my food. I've been craving carne asada nachos & it hit the spot."}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised at the low reviews recorded for this joint. It's actually a lot better than the measly 3.5 stars it has even though I rate it a half star more than the average.  Coming from LA where I know what's up with my Mexican fix, this place definitely serves Mexican food that can quite possibly resemble my beloved taco trucks in my hometown. The Asada can definitely be cut to smaller pieces, however everything else is as good as it gets. My personal favorite was the chorizo. I only got a single taco of chorizo and it was a mistake because I should have gotten maybe 10 more. They normally don't list the chorizo burrito outside the breakfast hours but if you ask, they will give to you. It's spicy and juicy. The pastor is cut from spits and served with the pineapples which gives the juiciness as well. The asada burrito was okay at best. Excess of rice and beans which takes away the taste of the asada. Nonetheless, I can easily eat 10 tacos.   Tacos are only $1.35 so take that Tacos El Gordo ($2.00 excluding taxes)!  This place is easily the best tacos in town."}
{"text":"The \"flautas\" are nothing to write home about. They were all over fried tortilla, really just a chubby taquito and I wish I would have got a burrito. They do have a salsa bar though, thumbs up for that and it was clean, well maintained. You're better off going another block down the street and on the North side of the road by Arby's is a little Taco shop called \"Tacos Tijuana\"... Much better choice, they have the best Al Pastor/Adobada tacos with the tastiest dressing."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 but the cashier lady that got our order yesterday (March 26 2017 around 5pm) she was kind of rude and she was eating while she was taking my order, not only at that time she was eating during chopping the radishes and while she was waiting for the food to be ready to take it to the tables..... I think that's not professional, I'm pretty sure she could've ask the other lady to cover her shift so she can go eat. I love this place I remember going to this place since 2010 and the other cashier that used to take my order she was really nice and had a professional appearances. The food is fresh and has great taste. The portions are fair to what you are paying."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place but the food is legit. Carne asada is really good, super thin and has a great smokey flavor. Try the Aguas frescas  make sure they're not the ones from the machines! Refried beans are good and the salsa are good too. Feels like a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"On the hunt for good cheap Mexican, I decided to drop in having passed by for years without stopping into any of the numerous taquerias along Trop. Their potato taco is awesome! It is huge and fried, with rich and savory potato filling. I also tried a beef sope which was ok, the shell was a little soggy and a little chewy. If that weren't enough, I also had the barbacoa plate which came with a TON of meat, very nicely spiced. Great value, good taste, not a bad place to stop into."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars the food was really good but not amazing.. the customer service was amazing and the menudo delicious. Had barbacoa was good my mom really enjoyed it because no fat and flavor wasn't overwhelming. Portions were very filling. The menudo was great! Plenty of meat in it super flavorful and their grilled onions on the side for tacos and burrito OMG generous amount. Coming back for that menudo! Thank you guys for the experience"}
{"text":"On this side of town for training and with lots of taquerias on this corner I figured the one with a second location is best. Food is fresh, place is a little dingy but has an east LA vibe from the graffiti on the bathroom walls to the signs in Spanish with English subtitles.  The nachos were amazing, the guacamole is fresh and the tacos were to die for."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco shops in town. I have been here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed. Here is a rundown of what I have had.  Al pastor tacos and burrito- I like the tacos, the meat can be a little dry but the salsas take care of that. The burrito had too much rice for me.  Sopes- I have had al pastor, carne asada, and chicken. They are all tasty and piled high with meat, cheese, and lettuce.   Carne asada tacos and burritos- Another of my favorites. The meat is thin cut and usually very tender.  Flautas- Very good, they are crispy and liberally stuffed. Good with the guac."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and i had the best super nachos in the world. Their carne asada had so much flavor. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"THE BEST CARNE ASADA EVER!!!!!! I highly recommend this awesome place for any carne asada plate. It's always cooked fresh to order and it's just simply AMAZING!! The place is small, but very well worth the wait. My family and I always come here when we have a chance to escape to Las Vegas. Just simply the BEST CARNE ASADA ever tasted in my life...you just have to go:)"}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  We ordered 10 lbs of carne asada and chicken for a Superbowl party.  The food was great. They gave us extra tortillas and side dishes.  Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Mal servicio mala comida ! Parece que la gente que atiende no es feliz y eso lo transmite  Jamás regresare a este lugar"}
{"text":"This is a go to lunch spot for me. They are nearby my job and can get me in and out in under an hour... SCORE!  On this particular visit I had a hankering for carbs real bad! The burrito with its combination of rice, beans, carne asada, and pico de gallo really hit the spot! I love that they have a grill so their carne asada is actually grilled not made on the flat top. They also have grilled chicken, if you prefer.   Their salsa bar features authentic Mexican salsa. My favorite is the green but on this occasion I tried the red. It worked really well on my carb-loaded goodness!   On most weekdays you can come by for a quick bite and on the weekends they serve menudo. This is also the only place I've found that serves potato tacos!   Their aguas frescas are good if you order from the selection next to the cashier. Do not order the ones behind her... those are made from a powdered mix. You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night. I ordered 4 tacos de asada and he ordered the same plus 3 de chorizo. The tacos were super stuffed! I'm talking about extra meat with onion and cilantro. The asada tacos came with beans on top which I didn't know before BUT they were pretty good. The carne asada meat was fresh cooked and so tasty! The ONLY downside is....their salsa COMPLETELY SUCKS! We tried all of them and none of them were to our liking. I was bummed out about that because the salsa can make or break the taco. Either way I'll still come back just because the asada tacos were real good. Just gotta' bring my own salsa next time lol."}
{"text":"Tacos here are good, better than king tacos back at home in LA. I always come here when I'm in Vegas. The tacos comes with beans and everything. It's really good. My 5th time here. My favs are the Asada and lengua (tongue) and cabeza (head).... Tasty tasty and spicy spicy...just how I like it...hahaha"}
{"text":"I come here quite often and get the tacos all pastor and Carne asada tacos... honestly,  I prefer to eat the meat out of the tortillas because it's tasty.  I feel like the tortillas take away from the flavor as a whole.  The asada and pastor are the best! I didn't care for the barbacoa taco."}
{"text":"Wow !  One amazing taqueria. The Al Pastor tacos are the best in VEGAS !  The girl at the cash register was soooo fun !  If u guys come to Vegas,  you MUST pay a visit to this little taqueria, you won't be disappointed..  A+"}
{"text":"The carne asada had good flavor, the salsa was fresh. We didn't stay to eat, it was super dirty inside. Food was good, though I was worried I'd get food poisoning from the dirty restaurant- I didn't... So yeah, if they cleaned it up they'd get more stars."}
{"text":"$1.99 street tacos were freshly made and flavorful. $.35 each taco for splash of sour cream.   Tortilla chips are not complimentary and the salsa bar does not contain fresh chopped salsa. It did have marinated carrot slices and limes plus three types of liquid salsa. Overall it was cheap ok food."}
{"text":"The al pastor is on lo mejor del Las Vegas status.  The mango agua fresca is on lo mejor del mundo status.  Had the al pastor burrito con todo, on-point.  The carrots and salsa bar was well stocked with fresh veggies, most importantly all clean.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Somehow it doesn't quite live up to El Tizon #1. The portions are big and the tacos are decent, but the food is nothing to write home about. Checking out El Fish Taco right next door next time I want some takeout."}
{"text":"The #1 reason this spot gets 5 stars:  THE MEAT.  The #2 reason this place gets 5 stars:  FLAME GRILL.  The #3 reason this place gets 5 Stars:  THE HOT SAUCES.  My favorite taco shop in town everything is flame grilled. The chicken is good, the Asada is , quesadilla  is packed with meat and cheese. I mostly stop in to order a burrito on the go. Some times, I do the carne asada plate, hurrache, or quesadilla. Don't get me wrong tho a lot of people order the tacos."}
{"text":"I eat tacos all over the town and these tacos lacked a lot of taste. They were very bland. I did enjoy the salsa, but the chips I got I felt were a little stale. I think maybe the menu items are way better but basing my review in the tacos."}
{"text":"El Tizon 2 is a pretty decent place. The staff is helpful and can guide you through the ordering process at the register. If you want to wing it, there are pictures of many of the foods on the menu board. I have never had anything bad here. The portions are large and flavorful.   Seating is a little limited, so you may have to stalk tables at lunch time. This time our group had several different plates. The Carne Asada plate was a little over cooked. It was a little burnt and dried out. The burrito is a safe bet, you can get it wet (sauce over it) or dry. The sopes are always a good bet as are the tacos and enchiladas. You can get Coke from the fountain or in cans, but I prefer the bottles, it adds that special something to the flavor.  Listen carefully for your number to be called, it can be a little hard to hear sometimes. Check out the condiment bar at the end of the ordering area. Watch for the roasted peppers to come out, they bring the HEAT!   Overall the meals are filling and a decent value. Check it out."}
{"text":"Soooo the best part about this place is the 98 cent tacos! I got some carne asada tacos, some al pastor, and tacos de papa. I was SOOOO excited to try the tacos de papa, I love them!! Well here theyre not like traditional ones, they deep fry them which I didnt like.   The carne asada tacos are ace! I love them! You can get them plain or with beans, oinions and cilantro atop... or any combo. Plus I always put hella lime on it! YUM!  The tacos al pastor were not my cup of tea, I wasnt digging them. They were WAYYYY too sweet!!   All in all I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Plates made to order, one of the best places I've eaten ever. If you like authentic tastey mexican food this is it."}
{"text":"Muy rico los tacos al pastor me gustaron y el menudo muy rico los empleados muy amables definitivamente lo recomiendo y los dueños muy atentos gracias tizón"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas ... closest to Henderson!!!! Love this place !!!... love to eat here with my fam!"}
{"text":"So we were on vacation and decided to go here all was good until we received our food and went to get the \"fresh salsa\" they had for self service, we saw a cockroach walk across the table, when I told the lady she didn't seem surprised at all. I decided to ask for my money back. I'm only giving them 1 start because I can't proceed without giving them one."}
{"text":"Not too sure how to think about this place yet. But i'll tell you about the 3 things I got.  Cabeza Taco - AMAZING. rich, smooth, and with the cut of the salsa from the salsa bar, really how you want one of these bad boys to taste!  Chorizo Taco - sorta dry, which despite how rich i'm sure the meat was is a bit shocking.  Al Pastor Torta - really quite terrible. The whole thing was dry and the pastor was bland. There wasn't any mayo or cheese in there to moisten it up and as a restaurant, that based on it's various graphics bills itself as a pastor joint you'd think they'd be able to do better.  I guess maybe the should advertise with pictures of cabeza? probably not because cabeza looks sorta gnarly but lawwwd its' good"}
{"text":"Good place not a lot of sitting. A nice staff helped out when need. Pretty big burrito filled me up at a good price as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get Mexican food! I recommend the cheese quesadillas with guacamole (only $4.25) and the carne asada  (which is a little expensive at $9.99). They also have a nicely sized condiment and salsa bar which is free. The location is a little ghetto but my only negative comment is that the woman who takes my order is rude every time I come in (no smile, mumbles, rushes me). I'm giving it four stars based on the absolutely delicious food!"}
{"text":"I stopped by after reading about how flavorful the meat is... I'm on a mission to find a place to replace Pepe's and I think I've found it. The cashier that took my order was super nice, the ordering process was easy...I ordered the carne asada burrito which comes with pinto beans... I prefer refried beans and they had no problem accommodating my needs. The salsa bar was clean, well stocked and had the spice I needed. The burrito was huge! I took the first bite and said \"goodbye Pepe's\"...the flavor was amazing. I couldn't finish the entire burrito, but I didn't want to stop eating! Not a single complaint."}
{"text":"I always pass by this place, and today me and my wife decided to give it a try. One of the worst decisions I've made this year. First we come in and there are flies buzzing all around, but against my better judgement we continued. We step up to the counter after looking at the menu to a lady who was very displeased to having to wait for us because we were taking too long looking at the menu I guess. We then order 1 super nacho with lengua, 3 al pastor tacos, 3 sopes of carne asada and 1 lengua torta to go. After ordering and signing the receipt the lady became disgruntled that we didn't leave a tip on the receipt, (she didn't provide any service other than taking our order and expected a tip?) She then proceeded to ask what we wanted to drink, the horchata was empty, the fountain drink soda lines showed out of order, the only thing they had was a lower than average tasting jamica. So we take our drink and sit down at the only table that has been \"kinda\" wiped down. Flies are still rampant and can be seen along the salsa line. We finally get our order, server brings our food and grunts as she lays it down, clearly still displeased at the no tip. I try the nachos, now I'll give them credit for the amount of meat on them, however this plate of nachos was not put together well or with any thought. The nachos themselves were in the middle of the plate, the refried beans (about the average household sized spoon worth) was on the side, the creama on the side, the guac and pico on the side, and all the meat was placed on top of the nachos themselves, it was not placed well and ended up being a crap nacho plate that took such hassle and forever to try and eat, after quitting the nachos I looked over to the al pastor tacos, these were the driest pastor tacos I had ever seen, like it looked like the went and dropped them in the middle of death valley to cook, left them out over the period of 2 nights then served them on what tasted like year old expired corn tortillas. I being hardheaded and always trying to give places a chance proceed to try to eat these bland and dry tacos where the only flavor from them were from the dry cut canned pineapple slices that were on them. (I've never had a dry pineapple slice until today.) I try to chase them down with the drink only to find out it is 80% ice and 20% jamica!! There were no refills allowed on the crap drink and I was forced to try to recover any saliva I had left. As with most Mexican or ethnic food places I was really excited to give it a try, but in the end I'm more excited to write this review to help stop people from making my same mistake. If your next to this place and you want Mexican, go down across the street to Tacos Tijuana or tortas gigante and get food that you will for the most part enjoy."}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken I've tasted at a taco joint. Their pickled selection is soaked just right and provides a great kick to the flavors on the plate. I cant wait to get back again and again! Agua de Sandia is bomb as well."}
{"text":"We love their carne asada tacos.  The pastor was too dry on two different visits.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Debating between 4-5 stars. very good carne asada. We got the carne asada nachos and it came with a huge pile of asada and fixings on the side which was great for sharing amongst 4 people. We also got lengua  and al pastor tacos and burritos. all were great. But the place is a little dirty and we had to clean our own tables. I'll update the next time i go."}
{"text":"This is a good taco spot when they get your order right. This is on the other side of town for me and I only come here because this is the only place I've found that has fried tripe/intestine tacos! So delicious! My last visit was a little disappointing because I ordered the lengua & tripe tacos but I didn't get a lengua taco I got a plain beef taco. Idk what kind it was but it wasn't lengua for sure and the cashier even repeated my order twice back to me. I didn't know my order was messed up until I got home. Another reason why I left 4 stars is because I order 6 tacos to go and they piled 3 on top of the other 3. Seriously? You could have given me 2 foam plates and put 3 on each plate instead of putting 6 on 1 foam plate. It doesn't cost you that much to give me 2 foam plates and foil to cover it. But other than that I'll only be back when I crave the fried tripe tacos."}
{"text":"I am only giving 1 star because 0 isnt an option...the service was terrible...quality of the food was aweful...the taquitos i ordered were from a store brand frozen taquito box  i ordered chicken and it was beef she asked the other woman if it was beef or chicken and she even said in spanish \"lo saque de la caja Y decía pollo\" (i took it out the box that said chicken) ...THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD AT ALL .... we were the only customers inside and when the food was ready she yelled out the number..... and then again stuck her head around the corner and looked at me and my 3 children and repeated that the food was ready....i felt like especially with it being that dead the least she could have done after serving me walmart brand taquitos was bring it to the table....we weren't greeted upon entering and it was extremely hit inside ....bothe females the cook and cashier were very cold and uninviting ...and its 2.60 for a soda you cant get a refill on"}
{"text":"I have ate here twice and boy its delicious! Definitely my new favorite place in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I only buy the Carne asada tacos, because they are  good and cheap. I can't vouch for anything else here. The tacos come with onions and cilantro and pinto beans. Although, I wasn't sure about the pinto beans they are actually pretty good on the tacos."}
{"text":"ok so this place is AWESOME! , I just did a large order for our company with 3 different payments and alot of food that i needed organized and put in bags accordingly they did an awesome job and the food was amazing! everyone liked it and it was very price friendly. will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I just sent my son to buy me a carne asada  for my husband  and believe me. I have seen bad food here in Vegas, but this one took the cake, the meat was so black, it was like petrified, stuffed with some limp lettuce. nasty slop!"}
{"text":"The quest for some good mexican spice continued as I set off towards the Hard Rock the other day. I was hungry, and I needed something that was both fast and tasty. With the amount of time I had before the Lakers game, I wasnt looking for love, a casual fling would do just fine. My tastebuds were willing to accept a one night stand.  But really, a guy can still dream, no?  God, if only I could find it.  A place with salsa in bottles on the tables. Maybe a couple jars of horchata on the counter. And fresh produce, greaseless tortillas, and no sour cream in the building... Someday...someday...    In my head as I drove across the strip I started doing the map out.  Ohana BBQ? No eastern and WS is too far... I decided Id go to Eastern and Trop and that would be my cutoff.  There use to be a \"Super Burrito\" over there, its gone now, I learned that the hard way, but there was still other Mexican joints around it that warranted a sample.  I decided on Tacos Tizon and dove on in.  This is one of those places thats incredibly hard for me to rate. it could fall between 2 and 4 stars, depending on your expectations and your order.  I got the Pastor tacos which weren't my style at all but for some reason I think I will order them again. The Pastor is done kinda Hawaiian style. They had flat long chunks of meat which was seasoned kinda pastily (pastey? paste-ish? with a paste like sauce?) which was mediocre but was somewhat saved by thin slices of pineapple. This is probably why I will order them again, because it was a little different. But in the end, I think its a flavor thats not really up their alley. They need to stay their lane on this one. Just cook the damn pork, chop it, grill it and slap on some flavor. Something tells me none of the cooks make theirs at home with the paste/pineapple combo.  I also got some Carne Asada tacos and those can come with pinto beans. These were a little better, although needed some help from the salsa bar, which, while fully stocked, came up a little shy in the \"hair on your chest\" department.   Soooo, foodwise its average.  But unfortunately, theres more to life that just treating your tongue to spice and laughing at the fall of the Laker dynasty from a self inflicted food coma.  Theres a little thing called $$$$, which is why this place gets the extra star from me. The board says tacos for 1.28 which is a hell of a steal, but for some reason they only charge me 88 cents per. Which is rediculous. I always order six, and then after they charge me the 88 cent rate, I order two more. Im wierd like that. At 1.28 a taco Im just fine w/6, but at 88 cents? I feel like Id be losing money if I didnt walk out with at least 8.  I dont know why they charge me that amount, nowhere on the board was that listed, and it was a Monday the first time it happend, so it wasnt Taco Tuesday madness or anything like that. \"40 cent Markdown Mondays\"? Probably not Anyway even if the 88 cent doesn't last and 1.28 is the rate, I would still say the tacos are worth it.   Overall:3.51 stars Flavor: Cplus  Service/Price/Speed/Phone Orders/Location: A"}

{"text":"Try their chicken! It's amazing, grilled chicken breast, Got sopes, tacos and Super Nachos all with chicken. Watched him prepare and cook the breast fresh as I ordered it. Was juicy white meat. Very impressed. Will come back!!!"}
{"text":"Come here on my lunch break almost every day! I love their Carne Asada Torta, or their carne asada tacos! And they have a $6 lunch special!"}
{"text":"Used to visit their sister location up in North Las Vegas on Cheyenne and loved it, so we decided to try this location at Eastern & Trop. This location is a lot bigger. The smells of the carne cooking over the grill are very enticing. Their carne asada tacos and carne burritos are about as good as they come here in LV. The enchiladas have a very tasty homemade red sauce and were devoured quickly. Taquitos were rolled when we ordered and were fresh, and very delicious. The place was packed (not surprising for a Sunday afternoon) with large families eating everything from tacos to menudo and pesole. Definitely a fan of both locations."}
{"text":"First time here and first time I had nachos that the cheese wasn't melted. We had the Carne asada  nachos for 4 .? They are barely enough for one hungry person.  They were tasty . To bad they use grocery store chips instead of making their own."}
{"text":"My burrito was exceptionally huge, and not half bad. My friend got two quesadilla's and probably ate more than she should have, but she loved it. We both spent under $8 for a very complete meal, and it filled us for the whole day. You should check this place out."}
{"text":"So a few months back I was on this side of town. It was almost lunch time so I started looking for places to eat. Bingo Mexican food!!! I walked in and ordered an asada burrito. You know when your starving almost anything tastes amazing right? Well I wasn't really hungry but I knew I wouldn't have time to eat later. Best freakin burrito I've ever had!!! It was amazing I told everyone about my experience here. So tonight I was at the apple store at town squire. Yes, I drove all the way here to see if the they could replicate the amazing burrito again. Well they fell short but it was still good. It was hot but a bit dry. Not enough beans for my taste. The last time I was here the meat was freakin amazing. It was juicy and crispy. This time no crispy no juicy. I would have rated this place a 4 but man this place was filthy. The first 3-4 tables had crumbs on them. I bet if I added all the crumbs I could have created an asada plate!!! I didn't think it was a big deal maybe they just had a rush or shift change? I'm not sure but I was the only customer in the joint at this point. I went over to the salsa bar. Grilled onions and jalapeños all gone!!! Don't really care for them but hey they must have been good right? You can get a pretty good view of the kitchen area from there. Omg the floor was a mess. There was paper and food on the floor. Come on people!!! Clean it up or be smart and move the salsa bar to another location. I don't remember the place being dirty. I will be back looking for that mystical burrito again!!!"}
