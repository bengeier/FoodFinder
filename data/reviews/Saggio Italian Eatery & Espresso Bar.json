{"text":"Nice place to grab a quick lunch.  Chef is a great guy.   Food is good and made fresh which I love.  Coffee is great.  The meats and pizza are very good.  I find the pasta to be slightly overdone for my liking."}
{"text":"Great homemade-style Italian food! Big fan of the thin crust pizza - delicious! Friendly staff, always smiling makes it a little hidden gem in the business area. Keep it up, guys!"}
{"text":"Nice little home style Italian joint in an industrial part of town.  Stopped by for a veal sandwich with all the fixin's.  Decent panini with a decent piece of veal. I can't say the the sandwich stood out from any of the other hot tables I have had.  Nino D'Aversa, Molisana, Abruzzo's...and the like all have the same sandwich with slight variation on the bun and the sauce.  Saggio's didn't stand out - no did the others over eachother.  This place is a place of convenience for me.  If I happen to be in the area and I happen to want to go to a Hot Table, it would fit the bill. I really should try the Pizza and update the review later.  Cheers."}
