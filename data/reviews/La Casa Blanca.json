{"text":"La Casa Blanca is a consistently good mexican food experience.  It is very rare that I walk out only thinking of how full I am and less about the lack of service and/or food quality.   Clearly the customer traffic seems to have dipped over the past year or so (they have to big rooms and in the past, the main room was always full so they would have overflow in the back room) but I will continue to eat at La Casa because I know I will have a good and consistent experience each time."}
{"text":"We frequent this place. Not for the service, or the food, but for the atmosphere. The waitstaff typically ignores you, and usually screws up your order, but the martinis rock :) and it is not a big deal when your kids go screaming through the joint knocking chips off other peoples tables. Price is average if not a bit expensive for the quality of food.. but again, that isn't why you go."}
{"text":"Good food and service!  I was a little skeptical after reading a couple of the reviews, but wanted to check it out for myself.   We have been there twice now and both times everything was great.  I am from San Diego, CA and am really missing the Mexican food out there.  I haven't found a place (in AZ) that I am crazy about just yet.  I am new at writing reviews but feel it is important now that I am reading them.  It's the fair thing to do!"}
{"text":"First time there, was not too bad, service was ok.  Second time, food tasted like a frozen dinner, service is very poor.  Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"It's delicious. That is all. Just kidding. I would call it slightly above average restaurant Mexican food. I personally still favor La Parilla Suiza over it, but this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca

Chandler has quickly been gaining a reputation from its popular Mexican food. I have no doubts considering the border is not far away. I have tried some of Chandler's best hole in walls, and La Casa Blanca is definitely a favorite. This fast-developing town has seen many new restaurants popping up everywhere, but for anyone looking for a fun and cultural atmosphere that serves authentic Mexican food, La Casa Blanca is the place to go
. 
The restaurant is on McQueen, just south of Chandler Heights. It's hard to miss considering it literally is a white house. There is plenty of parking, and outdoor seating that include a fire place and several flat screen TVs. One step inside takes guests on an exciting trip to Mexico. The friendly staff and vibrant colors of the interior such as the plates, murals on the walls, booths, and chairs, keep the energy exciting.

As soon as you are seated, you are given fresh tortilla chips with a traditional salsa and bean dip  that is to die for. We started off with a cheese crisp. It was excellent. My family and I shared one whole one considering it is roughly the size of a large pizza. For the entree, I chose grilled steak fajitas. I very much enjoyed when the fajitas were brought out steaming and sizzling. The fajitas are served with bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes that compliment it very well. I enjoyed this dish. The servings were big and a not too pricey. The food is definitely worth it. There were only a few desserts, but we went with fried ice cream. It's scoop of vanilla ice cream covered with crispy flakes that is deep fried and topped with chocolate sauce. The dessert is very rich, but full of flavor in every bite. 

Not all secrets can be kept hidden. La Casa Blanca is too delicious to not recommend someone going. There's no question that La Casa Blanca has become one of the most popular hidden restaurants around among locals."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we discovered this place!!  It's not far from where we live which is a real bonus!  The whole family loved what they got...of course my kids feasted on authentic Mexican chicken fingers and fries (this is their staple no matter where we go).  They cleared their plates (which they NEVER do).  No food wasted!!  Love that!  My husband and I actually ordered Mexican food and boy was it good.  First the chips, salsa, and warm bean dip were wonderful and I had the best strawberry margarita that I have had in a long time (just the right amount of sweetness, but not overbearing).  I ordered the chili rellano dinner and my husband got the shredded chicken chimichanga (enchilada style--with cheese and red sauce over the top).  The chili rellano had a light/fluffy and delicious breading on it and the cheese inside was so good.  The green chili sauce they put on top was unexpected, but definitely delicious.  My husband LOVED his chimichanga!  PLEASE try this place...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"They server breakfast just on the weekends in the morning. Not to bad. The omelette are big and they server you chip and salsa while you wait for your food. 

This will be a place for when I need breakfast ASAP and can't wait to drive to 10-I"}
{"text":"Order a margarita with Jose Cuervo and they charge you for patron and tell you it's the same. This place is run by idiots. Constant bad service. They do earn 1 star as they have great carnitas. Just order them to go!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food in a casual setting.  I like the location and building.  It gets a little loud in the main dining room.  Everything I have ordered has been good.  I just had the shrimp enchiladas on this visit.  Great!!"}
{"text":"i like the food here at La Casa Blanca. The staff is always friendly. The atmosphere is older in decor and could use some updating. 

I really like the Pollo dish wrapped in a tortilla with cheese and sour cream. It was delicious. 

I have been there 3 times and not disappointed yet. And its close to the house."}
{"text":"We like to frequent and support locally owned business's but wow, these guys can't seem to get the operation side of things down after all these years..Always short staffed with servers which causes long wait times and poor service. The food is great but the service is to be desired."}
{"text":"Okay I just went to this restaurant tonight and got back literally less than a minute ago. The first thing I noticed was loud the restaurant is....the restaurant is very open in the room we sat in and I felt like I had to speak loudly to be heard...it made having a conversation a little harder. 

Let's see so the atmosphere I wasn't all that great...the decor was kind of whatever and just not very fancy or anything.

The food was ok but not the best. One thing I did was ok was they give you bean dip in addition to salsa with the chips. The enchiladas were alright but not stellar..."}
{"text":"I have eaten at LCB many times.. I don't like the chain restaurants for mexican food.. I must counter the other review with the positives.

Their salsa is some of the best, its fresh, homemade and a little on the black peppery side.. They serve fresh bean dip (just have to ask now) and warm chips..  

I have tried the combo plates, the fajitas and the spinach and cheese enchiladas. The cheese-crisp is huge with generous amount of cheese. I ask for tomatoes on top.. I like their tostadas and crispy tacos.. I try to get a Mango rum Pina Colada which goes well with Mexican food. As for the tortillas tasting store bought, thats news to me.. I think these are far better for restaurant made than most restaurants like Chevy's who makes theirs in plain sight!

If you like the chains of mexican food, Garcias, etc.. give this place a shot, you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"Very close to home, average Mexican food. I wish it was better, we'd come much more often."}
{"text":"Will go here for lunch but it's not my fav.  The customer svc is so so and sometimes the food is great and other times it isn't.  Was there on Sat. and it was ok."}
{"text":"The service was very, VERY poor.  Waited for a complete hour before getting water at the table.  This was after ordering food.  The food was of course even later in arriving than the water.  Were told that they only had two staff persons in the kitchen.  When the meals did arrive they did not arrive all at the same time or even close (first meal came and than had to wait for over 15 min more for the last meal to arrive).  On top of this the food was plain and boring.  A burrito to me has the the veggies(or meat) plus rice, beans, lettuce and salsa.  (Yes this is an \"American\" burrito, but I get this kind of burrito at many southern CA Mexican restaurants and it is what I have come to expect.)   What I received at La Casa Blanca (after I had to tell them what to put in) was bland and tasteless.  It was mostly tortilla and very little filling.  I will not patronize this establishment again."}
{"text":"their green sauce is delicious! the food was excellent. the decor is very nice. patio area would be nice on a cool evening. ample parking in the lot."}
{"text":"Really disappointed, sad to see it go down hill past couple of years, used to really love.  Service is consistently bad margaritas not as good."}
{"text":"Everything from the moment you walk in is amazing. The decor, the hospitality and the food. This is trully a hidden gem and it is slightly off the beaten path. The first time I was there was in the evening and the gorgeous patio knocked my socks off. We had people from out of town and they were impressed with the beautiful patio area with its open southwest theme. When inside, the theme continues. Friendly staff, knowledgeable waitress and great food. I had the green chillie burrito and found it to have the perfect level of spiceiness. Overall service was good however my wife's dish took an extra 2 minutes to get to table. Otherwise good presentation and good food for all. I will definitely be going back and I can not give a higher recommendation in all of Chandler. Even downtown."}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca isn't one of those restaurant chains that seems the same.

They have great food, excellent service and a really nice atmosphere. The patio is awesome to relax & dine in. We'd recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a great restaurant experience.

Robert Pfeifer"}
{"text":"Like many restaurants there are good days and bad days. Went here recently and my experience was great. Enjoy this restaurant and even though it is off the beaten path, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"This is by far our family's favorite place to hang out.  It's kid friendly and fun.  Love their open outside eating area(numerous nights after the ball games were spent here just winding down with other parents).   The food is good--but oh boy the margaritas are wonderful.  Love their chips and salsa PLUS their bean sauce which they serve.....That could be a meal for the kids alone, but wouldn't recommend because you'll miss out on other fabulous foods!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The atmosphere was awesome and the margaritas are amazing! Definitely a must stop in chandler for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I love the building, I'd like to love the atmosphere, but very loud and noisy inside.  The result of concrete floors and walls, and no partioning walls.  The food is very mediocre, something my cousins from Chicago would probably \"think\" is real Mexcian food.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  Food is extremely gringo-ized.  It's edible, but defintely doesn't satisy my lust for good Mexican food.  The outside patio is awesome, but have never seen anyone using it.  Which is a shame... Has the potential to be like \"the Tortilla Factory\" in Scottsdale which really capitalizes on its awesome outside area.  I really wish they would cook real Mexican food, do something with the interior boringness and noise, and utilize the great patio!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Saturday night hangout 3 weeks in a row! So close to my home that I can ride a bike or take a Lyft when too many margaritas are the theme of the night. Patio and margaritas and more margaritas.  Next week we are doing a girls night out for more margaritas and patio time! Do they mind if I come every Saturday??? Every month? Can I reserved the patio for my book club on Cinco de Mayo??? Already calling for reservations!!! The enchiladas are delicious!!! Bottomless chips and salsa are always a bonus. Love this hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on our way to Tucson for lunch.  We had chips, salsa and sodas while waiting forever for our enchiladas. Service was slow, may have been short staffed. Chips-cold and stale, salsa-had better out of a jar. Enchilada sauce was like ketchup and both cheese and beef fillings were tasteless.  Never again!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Mexican food and when my friend recommended La Casa Blanca I was a little skeptical about even going. It's probably the cutest little place I have ever been to, it's absolutely great for a date, a small get together, or just a family meal.
The service was fantastic; little wait, the server got to us quickly, and checked on us quite often. I never once felt rushed and I was completely satisfied with how my food turned out. I'm a huge critic when it comes to fried ice cream and I have been to many places where it was absolutely horrible, but I can give a 100% guarantee that La Casa Blanca has some of the best fried ice cream in Arizona. 
The only real complaint I had was that the parking lot was extremely tiny. I went on a Tuesday night and there weren't many people there, but I'm afraid to see what a Saturday night would look like if they were to get busy. Also inside of the restaurant was extremely quiet I would of loved to hear maybe some soft Mexican music playing through out the house. 
All in all, I absolutely loved La Casa Blanca and I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Great food from the chips and bean to the carnitas. I have ordered many things and it is always good. Margaritas for the first time last night also very good."}
{"text":"We agree with all the 1-star ratings of this place.  Nothing special whatsoever...average at best.  Too bad, too, because we live less than a mile away...so we pass it once or twice a week on our way to Abuelo's or Moreno's.  

Was hoping that the new signage out front meant new owners, new management, new menu, new something...but not the case."}
{"text":"I was just here a few hours earlier today and I have to say that this is the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. The service was absolutely horrible. Our waitress barely spoke English and seemed to forget about us. She came and got our drink and food orders and we didn't see her until the food came. My drink was empty for about 15 minutes. I would of asked for a refill as she walked by except for the fact she disappeared  the entire time. The food at La Casa Blanca is okay however it's very overpriced. I wouldn't mind the price if the service was halfway decent. I've eaten here several times since I moved to Arizona but after today I really don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent atmosphere outside with the little white lights on the patio. Great service and good value."}
{"text":"Desperately want to like this restaurant since it's in my neighborhood. We have given up on it and tried again and again for years. Food is mediocre and the service (with sporadic exceptions) is terrible. Clearly management does not care or cannot get its act together. Thursday evening it took 20 minutes to get two sodas because they were \"out of clean cups.\" We were still charged for those sodas. There was a good crowd that night but also many employees walking around. They likely needed more direction. None of our visits here have included the manager stopping by the table to ask how our meal was going. I wonder why? Perhaps, there is no one managing this operation."}
{"text":"We had driven by this restarants and decided to try it. We are glad we did.  I had the chicken, avocado with swiss omelet and my husband had the traditional breakfast.   Excellent!  Beautiful, authentic mexican atmosphere.   Just beautiful and clean.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant about a year ago and it was pretty good. Nothing memorable, either good or bad. When I moved to the area, I looked forward to making it my local Mexican place. After a long hot day of moving I ordered takeout. Here's why I write this review: I've come to expect my cheese enchilada to have melted cheese inside. The cheese enchiladas were not even cooked I think. The cheese was wrapped in corn tortillas that were not dipped or cooked. So I paid about $15 for cheese shreds wrapped in raw corn tortillas. Outrageous. As happens I was too tired and hungry to deal with anyone. There are plenty of options around here, thank goodness."}
{"text":"For Arizona its pretty good. Atmosphere is fantastic. Food good but not great."}
{"text":"We heard the restaurant could be loud and a party leaving as we entered confirmed that two tables inside we very loud. We. Were taken to a table that we had to ask to have wiped off. Then I asked for a call tequila they only had 1800 and well not a good sign for a Mexican restaurant. After the food was delivered I began to notice how filthy the booth area was just filthy. I  also couldn't help but notice there wasn't a Mexican employee in the place .Bottom line I'll never recommend and I'll never return."}
{"text":"Its my favorite mexican restaraunt very popular in the neighborhood.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five was I think they should improve the margaritas.  My favorite dishes are the hard shell tacos and sonoran enchilada."}
{"text":"Used to come here years ago. Was in the neighborhood again and decided to stop in. Should of kept going. Service was a bit slow but not horrible. However, there was only two other people in the restaurant. Staff a bunch of teenagers. I ordered the Enchiladas Blancas and my girlfriend the Tortilla Soup and the Tequila Lime Chicken. 
Her Tequila Lime Chicken was overcooked and very bland. The vegetables on the plate were the opposite...not cooked at all. Her Tortilla Soup was basically a plain vegetable soup in disguise. The rice on both our plates was dry, a bit charred and devoid of flavor. 
My Enchiladas were smothered in something resembling cheese. The type as it cools resembles melted plastic.
Cant say we'll ever be back. Place has definitely taken a downturn."}
{"text":"I have been to La Casa Blanca over 8 times and this time was the last.  They have had some consistency issues before-sometimes the food is flavorful and spiced right-other times not.

As usual -the chips came out-this time they tasted like they had been sitting around for who knows how long or they were bought from a store.  Our entrees came out right away.  I ordered simply a chicken enchilada and a shrimp taco.  The shrimp taco was incredibily spicy to the point I could not eat it.  After flagging down the waiter, I told him that we had been here many times and that I had ordered this before, and that it was too spicy.  He replied that he would check with the chef.  He came back and made some lame excuse that it was the pico de gallo - I said no-the whole taco was too spicy and it was inedible.

The bill came out and lo and behold- the waiter didn't even have the decency to take the taco off the bill.  Forget it- you just lost our business-another loser restaurant here in Chandler."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in years because my first experience was underwhelming. Tonight I gave it another shot and was very disappointed again. First they ran out of the homemade tortilla chips and replaced them with stale crumbs. This was especially unfortunate since it took over an hour for us to get the burrito and shrimp tacos that we ordered. Once the food came it tasted good but it came out at different times and looked like one of the plates had been ready and waiting for a while. The whole time we were waiting for our food the waiter never came by to address the long ticket time."}
{"text":"Was good traditional type Mexican food plus authentic Mexican atmosphere. Was not impressed at all with their pico de gallo. Very bland & tasteless. 
Service was OK."}
{"text":"What a rip off!  Ordered Margarita and they scammed me for premium tequila and when approached...they said too bad you drank it you pay for it!    Too bad restaurants have to price gouge to make their numbers.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was good. Service was great and the margaritas are awesome. I'm giving them 4 stars because I think the food is lacking. I ordered the shrimp fajitas. The seasoning was on point, but I paid $18 for some over cooked Shrimp and onions. I only  had one sliver of bell pepper and my corn tortillas stuck to the paper they wrapped them in. If I wouldn't have taken the onions and shrimp off the sizzle plate I think they would have been to Burnt. Might have been alright for cheaper but you don't get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca is pretty far from my house I stumbled upon it randomly on a Sunday afternoon drive.  This is a really nice looking restaurant from the street so I decided to stop in.  They have a ton of parking in the rear of the restaurant  and the decor is pretty nice with a big covered patio.  The waitress I had was nice and my food came out quickly.  They have very good chips, salsa, bean dip and guacamole.  My chilli reno was good and came with what appeared to be fresh tortillas.  If I am on this side of town again I will definitely stop in.

Try:

- Bean dips and Salsa
- Sitting on the Patio"}
{"text":"We have tried to make this place work for us since it's next door to our house but seems like they always find ways to disappoint us. If it's not the long waits even when there are empty tables or slow service. The latest one, we arrived at 7:55pm on a Thursday and they told us the kitchen was closing. Yes, then I realized they close at 8pm M-Th!!! What restaurant closes at 8pm? I guess they are targeting only early birds. Might as well just open for lunch. They still had people dining and after all we arrived before 8pm but apparently they did. It want to serve us. So if you are thinking about coming to this place any time after 7pm be prepared to not have a good service. I guess we will stop trying."}
{"text":"We are pretty picky when it comes to mexican restaurants and usually only one of us likes the place. This time however, we both liked it! I got the chili relleno and a beef tamale with rice and beans and my boyfriend got the pork chimichanga. They were both very tasty and the the pork and beef were really tender and flavorful! We also had the house margarita which was light and tasty, unlike the ones where there is obviously too much sweet n' sour in it. The ambience outside is very nice with lights and an outdoor fireplace and tables, but it was too cold to eat outside that night. The inside is ok, and could use some renovating...the booth we sat in was being held together by duct tape. The service was also really really slow, and they were not that busy for a Sunday night. We will go back here for the food and to eat outside though, just wish they would work on their service!"}
{"text":"As our neighborhood go to, its ok. It came to the neighborhood, we can all walk to this establishment. I'm a creature of habit, i love their al carbon (street tacos). We enjoy the ambience. The employees are also respectful and engaged. A classic, with many of choices from the menu. Check it out."}
{"text":"If you are in the area, Casa De Mina is better than La Casa Blanca.

LCB isn't bad... its just not as good as other places. Lots of people were here though, but the food was nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca is hidden off on the east side of McQueen which is nice because it wasn't stuffed to the gills with customers.

From the get go, I really liked the white adobe style architecture and the dirt parking lot.  These two aspects lent an escapist rural aesthetic to the experience contrasting the hot pavement and strip malls that bombard the senses in daily metro living.  The patio area also looked like a pretty cool place to kick back on a cool, southern Arizona evening.

I was seated immediately, given a daily special and regular menu and had my drink order taken.  Chips and salsa were on the table in a flash encompassing both a standard red, tomato based salsa and a warm bean dip.  In all seriousness, this might have been the best part of my meal.  I could see myself eating just chips and salsa with maybe a cheese crisp and a tall iced tea and being completely satisfied.

Instead I ordered a red chile burrito plate.  It was okay.  Nothing remarkable.  I like my red chile to be a tad thicker in the sauce department and this particular red chile was slightly soupy while relying on the slow cooked beef to carry the dish.  

For a ten dollar plate, I felt the burro was sort of small.  It came with beans and rice which were also decent but not outstanding.

They have all kinds of stuff here: tamales, tacos, tostadas, enchiladas, all the usual suspects.  But for my money and my palette, I usually stick with a red chile burrito as a basis for my standard measure.

La Casa Blanca is a nice spot and the food isn't bad.  It's just not outstanding for my tastes.  I can, however, see myself coming back."}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca is slightly hidden in Southeast Chandler, but I wouldn't call it a hidden \"gem\"... I ordered the Pollo Fundido and was unfortunately quite underwhelmed with the experience. The staff was very pleasant and attentive, however the food did not match the service. The chips and salsa were satisfactory but the main course left much to be desired. I would not rule this place out entirely for future visits, but it would not be at the top of my list. 

The Corona was cold, though!"}
{"text":"We visited La Casa Blanca for a family night out.  The chips and salsa were very good, and they brought plenty.  But, the best part was their bean dip - it is the best bean dip I have ever eaten - I normally don't like bean dip and I could not stop eating thestuff!  I had a relleno for dinner and it was very tasty.  I hope to go back soon when I am not driving and help myself to a few glasses of draft beer, chips, salsa, and maybe some Nachos.  Also, on our visit we had excellent service.  Let's hope the management continues to keep this restaurant good by listening to those who visited and were disappointed in the service.  Viva La Casa Blanca!  I would like to see them add guacamole tacos to their menu selection ... mmmm, guacamole!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this nice little Mexican restaurant a great review, being close to my house and NOT a chain. However, the food is mostly average at best and the service is variable. The complementary chips and salsa (+ bean dip) is the best of the meal. We have enjoyed the quesadilla (adult style, with chicken) and fish tacos. If you like spicy food, this isn't your place.

Their plan for seating tables is difficult to understand - nights when the weather is beautiful, only one or two tables will be seated on the patio and you're told that they don't have servers to serve you out there. Meanwhile, they have both rooms inside filled to about half capacity? Huh? On other visits, they've indicated they are only seating the main room in front and will make you wait for a table, but they have a couple of tables seated in the back room? Again, huh?

The decor is very nice. Beautiful wall paintings throughout. Perhaps we'll go back in the fall/winter when there is a chance that they might seat us outside on a nice night. Then again, do we want to risk it?"}
{"text":"This is cool, low key place for lunch and/or happy hour. It has a great patio that opens at 5. You feel like it's a hidden treasure since there's not much by it. 
I have been several times and always enjoyed the food and service. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on Easter with some friends.  There were eight total of our party.  It took them a few minutes to get a table ready for us, our drink order was taken promptly once we were seated.  The chips and salsa and bean dip were great.

I ordered the spinach enchilada and my wife had the chicken fajitas.  The girls had a kids quesadilla and some rice and beans.  The spinach enchilada was very good.  It was served with a green sauce that had a nice spice to it and I like the rice and beans.  My wife really enjoyed her fajitas.  The friends we were with also enjoyed their food, they are regular customers and recommend the place.

I have wanted to try this place for a while but it is a little out of the way and I never think of it when we want to go eat.  I was glad our friend suggested it and I plan to be here again."}
{"text":"Place was ok, haven't been back in forever, kinda of nice its not in a strip mall, so location is a plus.

Salsa and food was average."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner Tuesday night. We arrived at 6:05, when we asked about was happy hour we were told it ended at 6. 
We were served chips, salsa and beans, we ordered an appetizer which came out very quickly. We ordered 2 dinners which were good but not great. The waitress checked often and did a good job. This was our third time at this restaurant and it was better than the first two times we tried it. It is kind of pricey for what you get, I rate it as a 3"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Mexican place.  The who puts green onions in green chili, YUK and the place had a horrible smell when we first walked in.   About the only good thing was the waitress."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Mexican food, it's a smaller setting, very charming! It's a little hidden off of McQueen but worth a try for sure! Food is delicious and always satisfying! Staff is friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"What an adorable little gem off the beaten path! I recently moved to the area and have driven by many times. I saw the sign but had no idea this place was a restaurant! 

Situated between a mini-farm and a small business, it took me a few drive-bys to discover this was indeed a restaurant. My mom and I are pretty particular about Sonoran Style Mexican food and this place passed the test! I only gave 4 stars though, because it took a few minutes for a server to come to our table--not a big deal because I understand they were busy. And though the food was as my son says, \"super-licious\" it was pretty heavy on the salt.

Chips, salsa, and bean dip were so yummy! 

 I can't wait until the weather gets just a little bit cooler to sit out on the patio with my hubby and sip margaritas under the stars by the fireplace. Ahhh, sounds pretty romantical!"}
{"text":"We have lived in this area for a few years, so we drive by LA Casa Blanca nearly every day.
From the street, it looks pretty bland, but once you get into the lot, you see that it is quite large and pretty busy. I think I may have stopped sooner if the lot was on the street instead if hidden.  
We went on a Friday night, got there about 630. Told the wait was 5-10 minutes, and we saw many open tables. 25 minutes later we were called back, and taken into another huge empty room. 
We got our drinks promptly,  but it took about 10 minutes to get silverware,  chips and salsa. Our food was out about 10 minutes after we ordered it. 
Kids portions were large, which was nice. We split an entree. It took awhile to get drink refills (water). 
The food was okay. Nothing spectacular. The beans were bland, the salsa was too spicy for the kids and okay for us. Our server was very nice, but the bus staff/runners were pretty lifeless. I thanks the guy who brought the chips and he didn't look up from his tray or even say hello or your welcome. 
I've heard their brunch is great, maybe we will go back for that sans kids. I like trying new places, especially non-chain places. This wasn't my fave,  but it wasn't the worst either."}
{"text":"I ate there many times and would have given four or five stars, but on March 14 The food was so excessively salty I had to take it home and mix it with something to tone it down for tomorrow. Even the bowl of fried tortilla chips they brought as appatizer were heavily salted down , which I never saw before anywhere! The Sonoran Enchilada was so salty I nearly choked on the first bite, and whatever that was they were calling corn enchilada tortillas were hard like cooked Dry-Wall. Even the beans and rice were inordinately salty. The young servers did as well, as they could  in obviously the first job they ever had. (very risky) Indoors and outside patio was busy. NO music balsting was Great!  High school children were serving beer, so check that before you renew your license to serve drinks of that nature.  High school kids as cooks and waiters may be cheap to get, but they will put you out of business fast."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. My kids love coming here as well.  Fajitas are my favorite. We really enjoy sitting outside."}
{"text":"For some reason my family comes back here fairly regularly once every 2-3 months or so.  It's one of those things where we go and eat, say \"well, we don't need to come back here again,\" and then forget that we've said that and go back.

The food is just ok.  Average.  I like tacos, and their carne tacos are decent, but no better than you'd get anywhere else.  The bean dip at the start of the meal is my favorite thing here.  If I could order a bowl of that with tortillas, I'd like this place better.  The beans that actually come with your meal are not nearly as good--they always have that dried-out, stale look that you expect from a fast-food restaurant.  My mom likes the enchilada sauce, but says that it's not really much better than anyplace else.

The service is pretty uniformly bad.  We once had a run-in with a manager who freaked out at our waitress for no apparent reason, but usually it's just a problem of inattentive waitstaff.  It almost always takes forever to get the check, but they always seem in a hurry to get us out of there once we've managed to pay.

I have to say, though, that my least favorite thing is the giant TV screens in the back dining room.  I absolutely hate TVs in restaurants, and although I'm willing to look past that if the food is stellar, this food just doesn't make up for the atmosphere.

Maybe this time we'll remember we don't need to go back."}
{"text":"very consistent food. Gets busy on weekend nights! I eat here a few times a month."}
{"text":"If it was possible, I would give this place ZERO stars, actually negative stars. My family had hands down the WORST service experience here we have ever had at any restaurant in AZ. The sad part is we had been coming to this place for several years now, and even had my 30th Birthday party with family and friends here last year. We have noticed the both the quality of the food and quality of the service has been severely declining recently. However, tonight's debacle takes the cake for all time worst experience ever. Here's what happened... 

We arrive at 6:15 and get a table for 5 plus a highchair. We are seated within less than 5 minutes. Server arrives (Sean) soon after we sit down and gets water for the table. We had to wait a while for him to take our order because he disappeared for a bit... maybe waited 15 min for him to come back. Here is where things really start to go south... so we are waiting, and waiting, and waiting... at about 6:50 he comes out and says our food should arrive shortly. Then 7:00 rolls around, still no food. Then the table next to us (about 6-8 people I think) that arrived a good 30 minutes or so AFTER us gets their food. Then another table that arrives after us gets their food too... then a table of 4 that arrived literally 15 minutes ago, gets their food. Now we are thinking something is wrong with this picture.  

So we ask for our server, he is no where to be found. So we wait... and wait... and wait... AGAIN. When he does show up, we ask for our food to-go because we have been waiting over an hour at this point (it was 7:20pm) and we had no food and had to go because our baby was getting fussy. He takes my husbands credit card to charge us for our food and says he will bring it right back... 10 minutes later... STILL NO FOOD and no server to be found, which means my husbands card has gone missing. 

In this time frame I had gone to the front to speak with the Manager with my Mom to let her know what happened and to see if they could locate our server, food and most importantly our credit card. The manager, the sorry excuse for a manager that is, arrives and is downright rude. She never apologizes and only says \"we are really swamped\" as I look around at half full rooms of people and say \"are you serious?\". We have been waiting well over an HOUR, all of the tables around us have food, the people that arrived 15 minutes ago next to us have their food. We want to leave and we want our card now. She disappears in the back and never returns. 

Meanwhile in the dining room... my food arrives (at 7:45pm) and guess what... they put it on FLOUR tortillas, even though I specifically asked for corn and said I cannot have flour because of a gluten intolerance. My husband noticed the mistake and asked the waiter \"are these flour? My wife can't have flour, we told you that.\" and the waiter (Sean) says \"well yes, but she can just scrape the food off and eat it without the tortilla.\" WHAT!?!? You have to be kidding me!?!? So someone with an allergy should just \"scrape food off\" to eat it?? This is literally no joke... the guy actually said \"scrape it off, she will be fine\" 

We then say, we are leaving please give our card back... and the waiter said he didn't charge it. We get home and check our account... guess what?? THEY CHARGED THE CARD!!! For food that arrived over an hour late, was cold, the wrong thing, and most of all this waiter was so ignorant to suggest \"scraping it off to eat it\". The ignorance and lack of any fiber of customer service or common sense is baffling. 

Save yourself the hassle and go to a different place where the wait staff is helpful, and the food is much better... or even arrives at your table."}
{"text":"Took my friend out for dinner for her birthday tonight. This place LOOKS super cute. The inside...not so much. Its dirty, and gnats were flying around the table. The food is terrible! I ordered the shrimp enchiladas. They came out cold...when I cut into the enchilada the knife hit something hard and it wouldn't cut through it. I opened up the enchilada only to find that it was the shrimp that hit the knife!! It was rock hard! It was not even really a shrimp. They were these itty bitty mini shrimps, obviously canned, that were unedible. The tortillas tasted like they had been sitting uncovered in the fridge for days...they had that freezer burn taste to them. Typically I would speak up, but didn't want to ruin my friends bday dinner, so I just ate the rice and beans and left the  fossilized enchilada alone. Now I'm just praying I don't get sick...."}
{"text":"This is a Chandler must for local Mexican food!! 

Hot fresh chips with delicious homemade salsa...my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Margs are delish and beer is cold!

Service is fast and friendly and we're always served big portions of piping hot enchiladas, rellenos, chimis, burritos...with amazing chili; red, green or 'Christmas' (my favorite cuz I love BOTH)!

Can get busy with holiday parties on the patio, but we've always been seated quickly when we just drop in. Always enjoy taking friends here for the friendly festive atmosphere."}
{"text":"New in town from Idaho thought I'd try the place out nice looking from the road but always thought it was closed. Pulled in and went to the parking area lots of parking few cars but must have been employees cars. 

Went in side nice out door patio would accommodate a huge party or gathering, fire pits, seating, some shade from the thin trees, gated and enclosed. Stepped inside to some kind of waiting room then into the restaurant. Seems there was only one person doing the seating and waiting of tables. Took a bit till he finished with the only couple that was there. Got seated waiter brought me water then chips and dip which was just salsa no bean dip. 

I have difficulty reading in the dark without my reading glasses yes it seemed kind of dark but cozy. Waiter took my order which was Chill Colorado, had a few chips and salsa then out came my order quick. Small portions more beans than rice the Chill Colorado was small and in its own little oval bowl and not much meat. Tasted good but for the price I would have gotten more in Idaho for less money. Compare the $13.87 that I paid here to the $9.75 that I have paid there. 

So I leave it up to you pay lots for little and nice decor or dine elsewhere. Won't be going there to often."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, Sonora style with there own variations."}
{"text":"This place serves very traditional Mexican food. Nice outdoor patio. Excellent chips and exactly what you would expect from the menu. Nothing fancy, but delicious food."}
{"text":"The service was spotty the food was lack luster, the outside dinning area was very nice. But for my money I would rather eat at Arriba's or the original Garcia's on 35th Ave."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The chips are fresh and the salsa has just the right amount of \"kick\" but not too hot that you can't enjoy it.  The service isn't always the quickest, but the staff is friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  The only downside is how early the restaurant closes, but now we know to show up earlier!"}
{"text":"I really love this place.   It's Chandler's little secret.  I highly recommend eating outside on their beautiful seating"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and anxious to try this local Mexican restaurant.  The outside is nicely light up with white lights and leads into a large outdoor courtyard area with firepits.   That is where the attraction for this restaurant ends. We were there on a busy evening and many families with kids loud or running around ruining even the outdoor courtyard experience.    At a family restaurant this can be overcome with good food and ambiance but we were seated in their 'overflow' room that felt very cafeteria despite the huge opportunity to create a authentic atmosphere in this home converted to a restaurant.  Water was served in plastic red cups and our margarita on the rocks was served warm.  The food was very bland with no attention to plating with any garnish.   My shrimp enchilada was not worth eating.  The chips were good as well as the bean dip with the salsa but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around. After trying other Mexican restaurants we keep coming back to this one because of the food and the patio. Try the Pollo Fundido or the Spinach Enchiladas with chicken. Those dishes are spectacular."}
{"text":"Been years since I have eaten here.  Came with the family tonight.  Ordered a carne asada chimichanga.  Asked for no sour cream and guacamole on the side.  Food shows up and as the server is putting the plates down, our server notices that they put sour cream and guacamole on my chimichanga.  He quickly apologized and grabs my plate.  Comes back with a plate a few minutes later.  He said sorry again.  I noticed that now it looks like a chimichanga turned over.  I flip it over and all they did was scrape off the sour cream and guacamole.  It was smeared all over my chimichanga.  I waited for our server to come back so i can let him know that if all you were gonna do is scrape it off, I could have done that myself.  
He ended up removing my food from the bill, which I thanked him, but explained that this is not what you do.

Note to owner:  you may want to have some retraining and explain to your staff that this is not customer service.  Especially going above and beyond to try and hide it by flipping the food over.  WTF!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received. We sat down, and waited for 20 minutes to be served. We had multiple servers walk past us and didn't even care to ask if we have been helped. We didn't have our drinks, nor the chips and salsa. All we had was our menus that the hostess gave us. We ended up just walking out. Terrible, won't be back."}
{"text":"You will always have a great meal here because you start off with their chips and bean dip.  I also love their Pollo Fundido.  Everything that I have had on the menu has been great.  Their only problem is sometimes their service is not the greatest.  When they get busy it is pretty difficult to get drink refills and orders from the bar.  I was pretty bummed out that I had to eat most of my meal without a cold beer.
They also have a great outdoor patio and on some night have a DJ and music.  This really is a great place to dine.  With a few improvements, this place would really be excellent!"}
{"text":"Okay, let me start by saying that I WAS a frequent flyer to LCB. My wife and I went there yesterday and were completely disappointed. So much so, I was going to ask my brother if the owners were new. First time I've been there and there wasn't 1 Hispanic working in the restaurant. Not a biggie, but there were only 3 people working the customers and 1 was the front desk person. Now, on to the meal. Wife ordered a typical bean burrito, deep fried with rice and beans. I looked at the tortilla and asked her if was fried. It was soo white. She said yes, but the beans tasted like they came out of a can. Same with mine. I ordered 2 shredded beef tacos, beef enchilada, rice, and beans. The meat was just barely warm in the tacos and I received a red chili sauce when I ordered a Verde. Not a real biggie, I like both, but still an oversight. Chips were so-so. I will not be going back until I find out if indeed they are or not under new management. Not pleased with our visit. Big disappointment since it WAS my favorite Messican food stop."}
{"text":"Had lunch on the patio with my sister last week.  Pretty, spacious patio, lots of shade so comfortable on that hot afternoon. The service was great and the food delicious.  I had Tacos al Carbon with sirloin - excellent, generous portion.  We also had guacamole with our chips - nice and chunky. The server was very attentive and kept refilling our bowl of chips.  The salsa tasted freshly-made and perfectly seasoned.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"There are way too many good to great mexican joints to hit up.  You don't have to settle for mediocre in this city!  I had the beef and shrimp fajitas and though our meals took a bit (it was a week nite but they had a large party on the patio) the service was apologetic and attentive.  Not his fault.  However when the food finally arrived I was hard pressed to find any beef among the onions, peppers and the four rubberized shrimp.  Three 3-4 inch thin strips of beef was it!  I asked the server if they forgot to add the beef but was told that was the portion size for the beef/shrimp combo!!  If I had gotten just beef there would have been enough for one decent fajita!  Can't honestly comment on the taste of the beef, as there just wasn't enough taste an form an honest opinion.  I can tell you that the shrimp sucked!  Way overcooked!  Oh, and I have to add that the skimpy portion size comes at a price of $17.99!!"}
{"text":"Granted they were busy but hostess ran into an elderly gentleman and almost knocked him over. If they are bust the food can take over a hour. I only stop here if there are a couple cars in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I have to say I was really impressed with the overall look and feel of La Casa Blanca. When it gets cooler outside I am definitely going to sit on the patio. The service was good, food was good, margarita was a little weak, but overall I will definitely return. Next time I might ask them to not seat me in a room where literally every single table has a screaming child. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover. That has never rung truer than it does at La Casa Blanca. This book is apparently borrowing someone else's cover.

While out and about in the east valley this past weekend, my girlfriend and I grabbed a late lunch at the nearest Mexican restaurant. La Casa Blanca sure makes a nice first impression. It's obviously a converted home featuring nice architecture with a tastefully (not obnoxious) decorated dining room and a beautiful patio.

Besides the beautiful surroundings, the staff is very friendly and attentive. Of course it wasn't busy at the late afternoon hour when we arrived. But it was starting to pick up near the end of our meal, and we saw a fair amount of take out orders. But after the chips and salsa arrived, the first impression faded quickly.

During our meal, an employee came out to the quiet patio and turned on some music. I wouldn't even mention it, except that it was kind of annoying and nothing more than a small portable JBL-type speaker. For the entire HUGE patio. Really?

The chips and salsa were delicious and worthy of a photo. It's a smoky salsa that emphasizes the tomato flavor and I really enjoyed it. But the rest of our food was more or less average. My girlfriend mentioned the shrimp in her enchiladas were rubbery. And I've never seen enchiladas made with flour tortillas. Something about this detail screams \"Gringo!\".

My Carnitas seemed promising. It looks great in the photo. But if you look closely, you'll see I got a lot of fat with the otherwise moist tenderloin cuts. It was good, but not great. And I just couldn't get past the really dirty (looked like dried eggs or beans) mitt that was delivered with my sizzling skillet. Last but not least, the charro beans were the most flavorless, watery beans I've had in a long time. And this was with some crumbled bacon on top.

La Casa Blanca has potential and may have been off its game. Judging from the other reviews, it hasn't always been this way. For that reason, I would be willing to give it another shot. Which is good, because I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Ate here with a party of seven tonight. Service was good. Chips and salsa were real good. Food was fantastic, I think everyone was pleased with their meal. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying we have been coming here for 9 years, and after tonight we will NEVER come back. Let's start...
Arrival- there were a few people waiting when we got here, put our name in and were told about 10 minutes.  After 30 minutes of waiting, a party that arrived after us, and was a larger party, was seated. I went to ask the hostess how much longer we would be waiting and she said we were next. I pointed out that the people that arrived after us had been seated and the \"manager\" said \"yeah, if a smaller party is waiting we sometimes seat them first.\" I said, we have 4, they have 5. Her response was \"oh, well they were probably here before you, you just didn't see them.\" Nope.
Seated- finally get a table and there are waitstaff everywhere but no one is approaching us. At this time a party that arrived 15 minutes after is is seated next to us and is immediately approached for drink orders and given chips and salsa. We still have not even been greeted. At this point we realize why, the waiter that has been visiting with the party at the table next to us, we could hear him address them as \"mom\" and they are obviously family, comes over to take our drink order and leaves.  He returns and leaves our drinks. It's another 10 minutes before he takes our order. After he leaves again, we flag him down as we still do not even have chips and salsa.  Meanwhile our server is leaning on the host table chatting with hostesses and other waiters. We had to get his attention for refills after drinks were empty a while.
Food- well a bug was flying around and landed on my half eaten food, what I had was good, not great. My husband had carne asada and it was chewy, and burnt so bad the edges of the steak were curling up.
We will never be back, and I know we are not the only ones. So sad because this was one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Been here several times.. The service is always good and the food is delicious! Best tortilla soup in the SE Valley!

The place can stand some repairs, like the booths are torn and the walls could use a coat of paint.

But if you are in it for the food, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you live in south Chandler, or don't mind the drive, this is the place for a nice sit-down, authentic Mexican meal.

Anything on the menu with Hatch Chiles will make your toes tap and your lips smack. The shrimp tacos are a personal favorite, and for breakfast/brunch, the eponymous \"La Casa Blanca\" is absolutely fabulous.

Chips and salsa are a staple at most Mexican restaurants, but here they are both fresh and delish, but careful not to fill up before your appetizers and entrées arrive. The chips are all complimentary and the salsa and bean dips are yummy, but nothing compared to the treats the kitchen will ultimately deliver.

What's the downside? It is always my intention to order the sopapillas for dessert, but I never seem to leave room. The rare occasions when I do, however, even these are especially good here.

By the way, this is a big restaurant with lots of parking, and lots of indoor and patio seating -- plus some great original artwork and sculpture to enjoy. All around, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio since it was nice out.  When and why did they start charging for the bean dip?
Service was prompt, Bree did a nice job checking on us without hovering.  Food was delicious, love the house quesadilla and the guacamole.  
It's nice to have a quaint family owned restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love the chips and salsa here. The servers here are always prompt and they have great food, big portions for leftovers, and very reasonably priced. We have been here multiple times and will keep giving them our business."}
{"text":"Most ridiculous lunch ever, I ordered takeout, placed the order 2 chimis, 2 pollo fundido, nacho supreme and chips, salsa and bean dip. They missed one of the items after it was even repeated back to me. I asked for some chip, salsa and bean dip,  he asked if we wanted large, so I said sure. He didn't offer a total so I figured I could add up the menu prices. Much to my shock and disbelief that lunch cost $87!!!!!!! Their prices are high to begin with so I thought ok maybe $60 but $13.99 for bean dip and $8.99 for salsa!!!! The food was not worth half of that. Carne asada overcooked, dry and burned. So disappointing, and I feel like it was highway robbery. I could've had a fantastic dinner somewhere else for that price or at least 2 or three lunches at any other restaurant. Never, ever again!!"}
{"text":"This is a standard Mexican restaurant.  The food is average, with some dishes that are better than others.  I tend to prefer the chili Colorado burrito.  We like this place because of the outdoor seating and the ability for the kids to run around outside a little, if not too crowded, so we can relax a little.  There are a lot better restaurants for Mexican fare, but this is convenient and close."}
{"text":"WARNING THEY ARE CLOSED - CHRISTMAS EVE

La Casa Blanca is losing a grip and/or they JUST DO NOT CARE ! - we live in the neighborhood and usually walk there because we have a drink - we checked Yelp to make sure this establishment was open before heading out (it stated they are open until 8 PM) - we got there just at 3 PM and they are closed - not to open again until Saturday - saw a couple leaving checking their phones probably to find another establishment - saw a man a employee heading back into the buidling ask to make sure they were indeed closed and ask him why they didn't make this clear on Yelp and he just shrugged his shoulders - good luck to them in the future, it seems they will need it."}
{"text":"Poor service, filthy and no one here but maybe 5 tables. Yet poor service, cold coffee, no ice in drinks, hard  tortillas humm I don't know why we bother coming hoping it bounces back?"}
{"text":"This little pace is tucked away but worth the find. The patio is beautiful and relaxed. Went for a late Saturday lunch. Service was so so and so were the drinks but the food and atmosphere made up for it.  

Faves: shrimp tacos and beans."}
{"text":"We just moved about a quarter mile from this restaurant so naturally we were excited to try our favorite style of food within a close vicinity of our home. It's kind of tucked away and quaint. The food was flavorful and plentiful. The service was a tad slow but we went in the night of an NBA finals game so the staff being young was trying to keep an eye on the game (being a server for 9 years myself I understand completely). We will be going back soon though!"}
{"text":"Kind of bland but the people are nice and the location is great.  Find ways to spice up the boring food!"}
{"text":"Not a very good experience.  

First - to reviewer ds v. and anyone else who dined at La Casa Blanca this evening:  depending upon where you were sitting there is a good chance that my table was the \"one\".  I'm not ignorant to the fact that for a period my 1 year old son was very loud and I do apologize to anyone whose evening was affected... I'm embarrassed.  That said, it is not the responsibility of the staff to \"control\" any guest of the restaurant.  This restaurant was very loud and full of several noisy, high-energy children this evening.  It is my understanding that this restaurant is regularly patronized by young families with small and noisy children... perhaps it is not the best choice for you.  And regarding the the idiot who yelled across the restaurant:  be a gentleman, stand up and have a conversation.  This is restaurant... not an WWF wrestling event.

Now, about the restaurant.  Upon arriving we were greeted and promptly setup at a table in the middle of the restaurant.  Chips, salsa and warm bean dip were quickly delivered to our table.  That was the highlight of the evening and everything was downhill from there.  Our server took our drink order but did not return for at least 15 minutes to take our food order... and then it was probably another 30 minutes before our food arrived.  During this time we were left with an almost-bare table and no attention... and it was during this time that my son was the annoyance.  At this point I couldn't even get the waiter's attention bail out if I had tried... and not-coincidentally once service resumed and food had arrived all was well... with my son.

During this period of time the restaurant manager did stop by to make a sarcastic remark... TO MY 15 MONTH OLD SON.  No conversation to us except another lame remark when my wife commented.  She later provided a rather insincere apology when confronted... she seemed very stressed... it's Tuesday night... hate to interact with her on a busy weekend.

The food - would have been alright (not great, but good enough) if it was warm.  The waiter did mention that my wife's shrimp dish takes a bit longer.  First - when was the last time that shrimp EVER required longer to prepare?  Second - how about delaying the preparation of the other plates so that they all finish at the same time?  My son's grilled cheese (yes - grilled cheese at a mexican restaurant.  give him a break... he's 3) was cold and fries soggy.  My enchilada was barely warm and my tostada shell was inedible.

I will mention that the restaurant does appear to use fresh ingredients.  I know the cheese is freshly-grated because a 2x2 inch remnant from the block found it's way into my wife's taco...

I wanted to like this place but probably not heading back..."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but great experiences here. I love the diversity of the food, it's not all one style of Mexican food. They offer Mexican food from various Mexican states. Delish!"}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca is a desert isle -- a stand-alone adobe surrounded by dirt and fields and housing developments under construction. I'd love to give La Casa Blanca 5 starts -- really, I would -- for their effort and ambiance. But sadly, the food is simply average. 
 
The setting and service here are really very nice. The Old Mexico theme is carried off well, with weathered wood-and-metal lighting and wall decor, colorful woven rugs on the walls, and rustic tile underfoot. The patio is even nicer, with strings of twinkling lights hung from the Palo Verde trees, and misters in the summertime and plenty of heat lamps to make cool winter evening comfortable. Our service has always been prompt and pleasant. 

Now for the downside... the tortillas taste store bought, the salsa is mediocre, and the meat rather blah. But if you're looking more for an overall enjoyable dining experience more than killer-food, a visit to La Casa Blanca will be worth your trip."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. From the ambiance to the menu to the food and especially the check -- huevos ranchero and coffee under $9 -- it was all great. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This just isn't my type of Mexican food.  I like a fresher, more gourmet type and this is the traditional kind slathered in sauce with refried beans and rice on the side.  The margs were made from a lime cool-aid tasting mix which I just can't stand.  Service was good though.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Good ambiance- decent service - great location w/plenty of space .
Lots of open space for parking."}
{"text":"We love coming here on the weekends for brunch. We haven't been other times, so I can't speak to that. The chips are hot and fresh, the bean dip is awesome and I'm addicted to one of the inlets. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I really would love to like this place as it is within walking distance but the food and service leave a lot to be desired. They are understaffed. You are not permitted to sit on the patio and wait for it to open (when additional staff arrives) but are rather restricted to the other side of the yard. If I had people wanting to spend money at my restaurant you can bet I'd find someone to wait on them or at least let them sit on the patio with all open tables. Then there is the food -  it's okay at best. The best thing on their menu is the complimentary bean dip. I love the atmosphere of the patio and we still go occasionally for drinks. Really would like to see this place under new management as it has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca is terrible. No chips at 6pm. How does a real Mexican restaurant not have chips?

Waited 15 minutes to order after our app was put in but the app never came. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I just heard they are carrying The giggling Marlin Tequila! I can't wait to check out the food."}
{"text":"It's ok.  If it weren't for it being close to home  I probably would not return.  Food is a bit generic and not super authentic.  Chips and salsa are good!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband last week -- awesome classic mexican food...excellent bean dip and red sauce. We will be back!

For the person who complained about the dirt road to the parking area, we actually liked the local character that added to the experience...if you want a posh place with 5x the price and trendy food, go to Scottsdale, they have plenty of concrete parking lots.

The classic white stucco building and rustic arches give this place a nice mission feel.

TIP: dont sit in the back of the restaurant...request either the diing area to the right as you walk in or the patio.

Great experience!"}
{"text":"The chips are hot and fresh!The portions are large so splitting helps to save money. I loved the mango margarita and the ambiance is fun. Great location!"}
{"text":"Been there 2x & the foods not that good it just lacks flavor. Last time we ate there we waited 50 minutes to get our food (on a slow Wednesday night) plus when I have to pay $13 for upgraded tequila in a margarita I expect a strong drink.  So close to our home but we won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had! I would not recommend this place. The service was \"okay\", it was pretty filled but obviously with ppl who have no idea what Mexican food is supposed to taste like. I think Taco Bell has better enchiladas than one I ate.

I ordered the enchiladas Sonoran style, apparently this is a tostado style looking dish with sauce on too. I had the red sauce, terrible!

My husband ordered the combo platter which came with beans & rice. He has an enchilada, carne Taco, and a shredded beef taco."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate to say, but this place has really gone down hill. We have been sitting here for an hour and three groups before us still haven't gotten their food. I understand that minimum wage has gone up so they needed to cut back on servers & cooks, raised prices on their food, even started charging for the bean dip!!! :o But not only has service been crappy these past couple of times I've been here but the bean dip has gotten super watery as well, probably trying to make it last as long as they can. They've even changed their hours and don't open until 10 on the weekends now. The main food itself is still very good once it arrives and the servers are all very sweet people. My family & I have been regulars here for years, coming in every Sunday for breakfast. But sadly I think it's time we find a new breakfast place. :("}
{"text":"Good stuff! My favorite is the spinach enchiladas - with chicken.  Bean dip is also very good!  Staff always friendly"}
{"text":"Oh! Yeah!! Great food! Really good, prices good! Service good! Loved everything! Will be back and will tell others!"}
{"text":"We came here to do a quick & casual signing of the marriage certificate / lunch with family. It was 3 pm on a Saturday.
First let me say that The patio is beautiful !! I can see why people would come out here to sit on the patio & have a few drinks .  
We were a party of Apx 16. We were assigned 1 (one) waiter .. And you can guess how the rest of the visit went from there. The Poor kid couldn't tell if he was coming or going . Meanwhile there were 4 other severs inside the empty restaurant entertaining themselves with anything but serving the only customers in the establishment . Food eventually made its way out , it was ok. 
Will we be back? Absolutely not . 
Too bad"}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca has amazing food! Every time I have eaten here it has been good. Everything is fresh and they have fresh tortilla chips and salsa before every meal. The cheese enchilada's are very good as well as the crunchy shredded beef and shredded chicken taco's. The service has always been very good and our servers have always been attentive. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant as a great authentic Mexican option in Chandler."}
{"text":"We were so excited when this restaurant opened. South Chandler in the early days had very few local restaurants. 
This much anticipated restaurant has turned out to be very dissapointing. It earned the nick name \"surprizes\" because you never know what you are going to get. The proprietor is not very accomodating or helpful and the food is extremely salty over all.  
The salsa is quite good I must admit however this place has far too many issues to resolve before we ever return.  The food is poor and any complaints constructively directed to management fall upon deaf ears. 
We only live  a half mile from Casa Blanca, but we will not eat there under any circumstances anymore. 
The food is terrible... 
The chips and salsa course is as good as its ever going to get here..."}
{"text":"This place is dirty & the seats are ripped and run down. There's a bunch of kids running this place and the customer service is horrible. Food is not the best as it was when they opened"}
{"text":"This was a favorite neighborhood haunt until today.  The Margarita we paid $13 for was watery and tasteless.  The waiter swore he'd added a full shot of Gran Marnier to each and if he had it was watered down Gran Marnier.  It took 3 pks of sugar to add enough flavor to make it drinkable.

The cheese in my Quesadilla wasn't melted all the way and my husband's Machaca was a mushy glob.  I don't know what's going on there but it would be a shame to lose such a popular place.  We were terribly disappointed and won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time on a Sunday Morning. They have new hours they don't open till 11.

It is a old place kinda cool if you like tape on your seat cushion. 

Got a very young nice waitress, saw nothing but high school kids working their.

I ordered a Green Chimmy Chunga and of course it I got a Red one.
The meat was not fresh, I could tell it was microwaved but I was so hungry. Well I got a Tummy ache later on and felt like vomiting.

A couple there wanted alcohol but the waitress said the Owner/Manager doesn't get their until 12 noon but she will see what she can do and she brought them out a Bud or Miller Light and said I'm 17 years old. I looked it up and you have to be 19k to serve alcohol in the state of AZ. 

It was freezing for some reason she opened both doors, if I wanted to feel a cold breeze I would of sat outside.

The outside seating area looked real nice, looks like it would be nicer outside.

The outside would be good for larger parties.

I will NOT be returning do to me getting sick.  I'm still on a search for a good Mexican Restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Mexican restaurants in Chandler. Very nice clean establishment. Very nice outside seating and probably great for a gathering. We've been thinking of having one here. Recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Kinda breaks my heart to write this update but man-oh-man. Last night we decided to stop in for dinner around 6pm. Unfortunately our normal quick seating at the bar was taken by someone (only 4 seats at the bar!) so we opted for a booth. 

Right away, chips, salsa and bean dip were delivered to our table. And our server took our drink order. We got our margarita pitcher and were not very impressed (tasted like simply all sugary sweet and sour with very little alcohol)

While sitting here we noticed it was awfully muggy/sticky which made us wonder what was going on with there A/C as the dining area is not that large. To add to it there was ZERO music on, so all we heard was 9 different conversations going on at once, making it feel like a cafeteria more than a restaurant. (this actually caused us to not order dessert as it was so unpleasant)

Now we come to our dinner, my husband ordered the Pollo Fundido, this is a tough dish to mess up it's simply chicken and cheese deep fried in a tortilla topped with more cheese and a jalapeno cream sauce. This turned out pretty good. 
I went with my usual favorite of shrimp tacos. boy was I let down... the shrimp used to be large and fresh tasting, now they're small cocktail shrimp with little to no flavor. 

Even though this place is a quick and easy option for us, sadly I don't think we will return for dinner any time soon. There are far more options close by that offer better service and more fresh flavorful food with a more inviting atmosphere.

I still gave this a 2 star as their breakfast has been good AND when the weather is nice, the patio is much more enjoyable than the inside)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time....it's amazing. Fresh food and excellent service. Went there with my daughter, boyfriend and his children. The food was hot and done to order. The chips were served with salsa and a spicy bean dip. Both were tasty. I had the fajitas with chicken. It came with rice and beans which were perfect. An awesome little out of the way place that I will recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Service is very poor only one room being used, ran out of salsa in plain view and the waitress walked by several times paying us no mind. Couple came in after us got drinks and chips at the same time we waited a while. Food isn't flavored very well. It had been awhile and I wanted Mexican, it will be awhile again before I'm back. Just the lack of consistency keeps me from being a regular customer. There are many other things here that I could tap to but with a minimum of 12 tops being open you'd expect better service, at least more attentive. Well this visit was a miss!"}
{"text":"I used to live right down the street from La Casa Blanca and my wife and I used to visit once a week but that was 3 years ago. We moved to Gilbert and didn't visit until tonight. Walking in on a Friday night in the past you had to wait but now none of the tables in the front room had customers only the booths were used and the back room didn't have anything going on. 

I read the past reviews and I was stunned because it used to be a 4 star eats. But now I didn't believe it was possible to have food there without flavor and how do you make Mexican food bland? Is it even possible? But yes it is possible but man they did a great job and the wait staff was just blah. They could not care if we were there if we there. They were not rude just not engaged at all. 

I'm very sad at what happened to this place. I don't know if it changed owners or management but we won't be returning. 

Good Luck out there."}
{"text":"I was if-y about coming in here. I should've went with my gut feeling. My mom and I walk in, we didn't get acknowledged until about 5 mins saying to hold on. My mom and I noticed there was TONS of tables empty and clean. Then another girl comes by and tells us it'll be about a 10mins to have us seated. WHY?! There was no one there. Well that was the end of my experience. I took my business elsewhere. Lazy workers I suppose!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant tonight with the fam. The ambiance & decor was very nice. The food was so/so. The service was good, but it wasn't bad either. The waitress's alllllll looked frazzled,hair all messed up in tossled  ponytails (all of them)  & just in speed mode. No, \"have you been here before, have any questions about the menu\", nothing. When the food was dropped off the waitress didn't come back until she noticed dirty plates stacking up at the end of the table. She asked if we wanted the check, brought it to us & was done. Not personable what so ever. 

My husband ordered the trio fajitas & only had 3 shrimp on the whole plate, to me that doesn't seem right. I had the flautas, they were good, just not much flavor to them or the beans and rice. The salsa & chips brought to the table on the other had had sooooo much salt on & in them you could barely eat it. 

The best part of is all was my strawberry blended margarita. The waitress asked if I wanted sugar around the rim, I said yes, it's brought to me with half the rim maybe even a quarter only having sugar, ummm ok then. But that didn't mess the taste up & it was really good! I'll definitely be going back for more of those! 

All in all it's a good restaurant. The staff just needs to not be in such a hurry, look a little more presentable with nice hair & not chipped nails oh & they should invest in tray holders to open up & set trays of food on. Sliding it on and off of adjacent tables is pretty gross when you think about it."}
{"text":"I took my family here last night for the first time.  WOW!  amazing food, amazing service, and definitely a place i would recommend.  Next time we will try dining outside as others have suggested."}
{"text":"Disappointed this trip since I like this place since it is near my home. However, something always happens that makes me not leave a better review. This latest time, we ordered a cheese crisp to start, then our entrées. Well, our entrées showed up but the cheese crisp never did. Come to find out the server didn't enter the cheese crisp into the computer.  Apparently our waiter was trying to impress us by memorizing our order. Verdict? Not impressed. But then he returned and asked us when we were eating our entrées if we still want the cheese crisp? Why the heck would I want a cheese crisp for an appetizer when you already served me my entrée?  The food was not as delicious as usual. The beans and rice seemed undercooked.  I like to hydrate while I eat and noticed my drinks were not filled nearly enough."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place. Actually  I do like the building and the decor and the beautiful courtyard,however the service is very slow. My husbands food was barely warm it took 10 min to warm up then it was over cooked. My fajitas had good flavor and was piping hot but the shrimp and chicken were a bit over done and dry. The people were nice and friendly but we probably will not be back."}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca was a great restaurant! Being a fan of Mexican food it is a definite favorite of mine. The Mexican culture of this restaurant is as authentic as it gets and the food lives up to its reputation. Being so conveniently close to my house it was not a far drive for me at all! It was not out side of my cost range and the food was very good. I will definitely be going back to this nice little restaurant! 

My overall experience was great at La Casa Blanca. The service was amazing! My waitresses were very attentive and always on task. I never had to ask for a refill, they just brought me a new drink when I was out of my beverage. While at La Casa Blanca I ordered the chicken quesadilla. It was one of the better quesadillas I have ever eaten! The best part was that it did not take an excessive amount of time to make my food which is always a positive. The atmosphere was second to none. The patio area was my personal favorite. It is so relaxing out there, especially at night. The seating arrangement was planned very well being that there was enough room for everybody. It was not crammed in there and it has a very good vibe in the restaurant. 

After my experience at La Casa Blanca this restaurant became one of my favorites. it is suitable for all ages and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Mexican food and that culture! Their Mexican culture varies a lot from the American food culture; by the way they make their food, how they set up their restraints, and most of all the music they place there. Anyone who likes good food and a great place to just relax and have a drink should definitely try La Casa Blanca!"}
{"text":"Very pleased. I've lived in Arizona for about 10 years now & I will say this is on my top favorites of Mexican restaurants now. The restaurant is so beautifully decorated. The food itself is delicious & not badly priced. Personally I will be returning when I am craving some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Mike and I ate there last night.  The frozen Margarita's are awesome!  I had the shrimp tacos with grilled vegies and Mike had the ground beef enchiladas-Wonderful.   The salsa and bean dip for the tortilla chips is great, too.
Our server and the staff was top notch.  It was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent spinach enchiladas. Especially good Pollo Fundido when New Mexico Hatch green chilis are in season. Nice outdoor patio and fireplace. The quality is more inconsistent than I'd like it to be - sometimes it's downright fantastic, other times just okay."}
{"text":"I can't for the life of me figure out why there aren't better Mexican restaurants around here! The decor of La Casa Blanca is great, I love the romantic feel of the twinkle lights outside with a cafe ambiance. No one acknowledged us when we walked in until they were finally ready to seat us...with dozens of open tables it seemed to be a lot of fuss for no reason. Our server was great, chipper and sweet. But the food was pretty bad. My guy got the carne asada plate which was just meat with beans and rice on the side. Tortillas that were not special, we buy better ones at the store. No veggies or guac or sauce. The meat was dry, hard to pull apart and just gross. He asked for a steak knife and she said they lost all of them but she did manage to rustle one up. Strange. I got the house quesadilla which was actually ok tasting but dripping with grease. The chips and salsa were good. I was pretty disappointed overall but at least now I know it's not as good as it's beautiful facade."}
{"text":"Came here last night for Cinco de Mayo and had a great time. They have an awesome patio and we sat out there for hours under the freakishly bright moon. They had an really rad dj that was playing a cool mix of American pop and hip-hop, latin salsa, and raggaeton music. The servers were all super friendly, even though it was obvious they had had a long day. The food was pretty good; it was  fantastic idea to have a guy set up a grill outside to make carne asada tacos. Those were extremely tasty and only $1.50! This is a family restaurant so the crowd was very tame and the party started winding down around 9pm. But we are not big partiers so that was exactly what I was looking for.

I look forward to coming here again on a \"regular\" night and trying more of their food."}
{"text":"We arrived and sat for 15 min before we got served. You would normally think that's outrageous but considering our server Savanna was taking care of 12 tables by herself we over looked this. Once we ordered it took 5 minutes to get our shrimp fajitas and drinks. Great timing and great food. Thank you again Savanna for a job well done."}
{"text":"Living in the area, we had such high hopes for this restaurant, especially since there are few options.  Service is very slow, servers are pretty forgetful, and the food quality is lacking.  If you are in the area and hungry with no other choices, then at least you will be fed.  However, if you seek flavor as well as efficient servers, I would seek other options.  In my opinion (and I am a Chef) Mexican food is the easiest to prepare, so if you mess that up, I seldom hold out hope that I will return.  First impressions typically tell a story!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here twice in the past two weeks...that's how yummy it is. Had the same waitress both times. She was very nice. Had the Chorizo and Egg breakfast minus the rice and add the potatoes. Their breakfast potatoes are super yummy. The second visit we did wait quite some time for our food...but to our surprise they removed a meal from our ticket for the inconvenience without us asking!!!That's what I call 5 star!!! Will make this a regular place to visit. Also can't wait to come back and sit out on the patio one evening!!"}
{"text":"This place has become one of our regular dinner places.  The food and service are always great.  I am upgrading my rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is a great out of the way place that is Authentic! I hate Chains! The patio is very romantic and big and the food is really good! I've had the shrimp enchiladas, chicken chimi and many more wonderful dishes.  The fajitas! The servings are large and sometimes after all the chips and salsa which is really good I can only finish half my meal! There are two dining areas I prefer the one with the booths as its a little quieter. TIP: on Fri. and Sat. night there is a long wait so if you need to be at a movie or something go early about 6pm. Also the patio fills up fast! I have since moved to Boulder, but every time I come to Phoenix (which is a lot) I make the trip a little further south to come here and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We used to come here for dinner all of the time and then started to come for Breakfast after church.  It has been going down hill for some time and we, unfortunately won't be going back.  Service is horrible, food is less than average and is going down.  My wife had to wait ten minutes for her toast after she already had her meal.  The eggs were cold by then.  When we asked for a refill on coffee, it took a long time and then they ran out of cream.

Come on guys, you are better than that."}
{"text":"Service is bad, as usual. Very disorganized. Twenty minutes for a cup of coffee and waiter to come by. Food's so/so. Don't know why I bother coming here, other than they're close. Think I need to give them up and find a place that \"gets it\"...."}
{"text":"Word on the street is that they were shut down by Sheriff Joe for 3 weeks after a sweep and took that long to get new employees.  So we thought we would give it a try again because it is so close to the house.  We thought they may have gotten a competent chef.  It was about half full and everyone seemed to be running around in a panic.  Asked for a table of 8 on patio.  Waited 15 minutes while we looked at all of the empty tables and chose to leave again without dinner and headed to another Mexican joint a few blocks away.   We would have been happy with a few margaritas and a sever to acknowledge us."}
{"text":"Overpriced, entire wait staff seem to be under the age of 17 or so which leads to my order being messed up 2 times out of 2 different attempts. This also leads to slow service. Plus, as an added benefit, you get a nice \"farm and livestock\" odor blowing in from the adjacent farm. The food isn't too bad though and the salsa was good, that is the only reason for the 2 star rating. Won't be going there again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I recently went here with my family after a long day of moving. I remember I'd been here quite a few years ago, but I didn't remember what it was like, so now we're back to try it again.

I'm going to keep this review relatively short because there's really not that much to say. The mexican food here is just about what you get at every average mexican food restauraunt in arizona. That is to say that it's good, and it's fresh. The food came out hot and the tortilla chips were crispy. What I didn't like about this place was that it really busy. I don't mind busy usually, however, when you don't have the wait staff to keep up with cleaning tables, and you're sat down at a table that still has crumbs on it and no silverware it's a problem. There were several tables that still had drink cups and plates waiting to be bussed away after a meal. The Waitress barely spoke any english. I wasn't terribly hungry when we came, so I tried to order a flauta a la carte, and she brought me a flauta meal. They were good and i didn't have any complaints, but I don't care for rice and beans, which is why i ordered a la carte. My wife liked the rice and beans however. The fried ice cream was pretty good, although not as crispy as I like, I don't think it was fried long enough. The sopaipilla were good as well. Overall, decent mexican food, below average cleanliness and wait staff bring this place down. I'd go back with a family member if they wanted, but on my own I'd rather go to macayos."}
{"text":"Visiting family from Southern California.  We know what good Mexican is supposed to taste like.  My mom took us here and the results......

The good: was seated fairly quickly, drinks were out quick and food was out in a reasonable amount of time and our server was a nice guy. The bean dip appetizer was descent. That is the extent of the good. 

The bad:  it started driving into the dusty, dirty rough driveway they call a parking lot.  I ordered shrimp tacos with rice. They were nasty, barely cooked with runny chipotle sauce. Not appetizing at all. The rice tasted more like Chinese fried rice that had been under a heat lamp for a while. Dry and not appetizing.  My husband had the sopitas some tostada thing with very dry meat on the top of a greasy dough ball. Beans were horrible. Dry as a popcorn fart. Maybe microwaved and canned. Totally tasteless.  

Never be eating here again!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner her with @oouchanme, her daughter, and my girls.

I loved the spicy refried beans that were served with the tortilla chips!

Chile Colorado chimichanga was delicious, and a generous portion size.

Very courteous and friendly staff. Would come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Fair to good menu. Food always seems over salty with no flavor- but fresh. Service always fair. That's why 3 stars. Has a great location, building, parking and outdoor patio with again a so-so happy hour. Only place like this south east Chandler. Love to own this restaurant and make changes."}
{"text":"i was with a group of four and we entered the La Casa Blanca at 1:30pm for lunch, we left at 3:20pm.  We ordered drinks and then waited for over half an hour for our waitress to return to take our food order.  It then took over 45 minutes to get our food and the food was awful.  The meat tasted like it had been cooked before, put in the refrigerator, then reheated.  The retried beans were stale and hard looking like they were microwaved, and the guacamole was a dark grey color.  When we asked for the check the waitress never came back.  We went up to the front and asked again for the checks and waited again for 15 minutes.  Now I was reaching my end of patience and decorum and asked for the manager.  She came out and stated in her rebuttal that we should have asked at the table for new food and not at the end of service.  I was (over the cliff) and asked why in the world would we do that when it had already taken so long for our first order?  The manager just starred at me with no hint of being attentive.  I asked why she was turning the blame onto us, and she smiled.  This \"Manager\" actually accused me of being belligerent and talking over her.  The only good thing was the diet coke!  I will never support this establishment nor will I recommend this place.  Too bad because its beautiful!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place dozens of times and wondered if they were any good.  I found the existing reviews inconclusive so we decided to drop in for dinner one evening.

When we arrived we immediately liked the outdoor area and the warm decor inside.  

A couple came in behind us and we inquired if they had been there before.  They replied that they had and we asked if it was good.  The husband shrugged and uttered, \"Meh.  It's gringo.\"

We stayed and shared an appetizer and an entree.  We were served a small dish of frijoles and a small dish of salsa.  To our surprise the frijoles were rather hot.  Not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  The salsa was ok and spicy as well.

As if to continue in the same vein, our enchiladas arrived and the filling was very spicy.  Again, not terribly flavorful, just spicy.  We had one pork enchilada and one beef enchilada.  I couldn't tell which was which for sure.

The tacos el carbon appetizer that we shared had so much fresh, raw onion on it that we were tearing up and picking it off.  Strange.

Well, now we know and we won't wonder about it when we drive by but we certainly won't be back.

I like spicy food that is flavorful not just hot for the sake of being hot and nothing else going on."}
{"text":"solid old school, fSonoran desert Mexican food!  Love the patio, love the neighborhood feel and tasty comfort food. Their beans are great/made from scratch - fresh. one of the best red chili chimis in the Valley, easy."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night, food was average but the service was the Worst we have ever received. We waited 21 minutes when after we were seated and then went looking for a waiter, they said he would be right there, it was another 10 minutes before he came.  had to ask for chips three times and never did receive a refill on our water or the offer of another drink or anything.  Will not return....it was horrible and still cost more than $35.00."}
{"text":"The chips and bean dip are the best things going for this place. The food is mediocre at best. They got busted for employing illegals and closed down for a while. Have it one more shot after it re-opened and still not the best. Rice is very dry and the food is missing the mark. Sad as it's close to home."}
{"text":"I have never had anything but a good experience the many times I have been to La Casa Blanca Authentic Mexican Restaurant.  Immediately as you walk in, an classic Mexican aroma is set with a beautiful, inviting traditional Mexican painting in the entry way.  You are greeted as soon as you walk in, and in my experiences seated within 10 minutes.  

The place itself is very clean and the staff is very friendly and quick at serving you.  Right as you are seated, freshly baked chips, fresh salsa, and piping hot bean dip is served to you.  The entrée items are delicious and a good portion size, with sometimes something to take home depending on your hunger.  I would recommend the Mini Enchiladas with Red Chile, they are just spicy enough to set off your taste buds and heavy enough to fill you up for days.  As far as dessert, I was too full to figure out what was good!  The prices are moderate, at about $10 or more an entrée.  

Just a reminder that this restaurant is almost always busy, so be ready to experience a lot of people, and a lot of noise.  It may also take your server more than a few minutes to serve you, but the wait is worth it! Hidden on McQueen and Riggs Road it is certainly worth stopping by for an authentic Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with the hubby. Was a little worried because of some of the reviews that I had seen, but thought what the heck, let's try it. I had chicken fajitas and hubby had chicken and steak fajitas. Both were delicious. Came out sizzling and stayed hot through the whole meal :-). The steak was tender and had very good flavor. Chips were yummy as was the tea. There were only 2 girls waiting on the whole dining room so service was a bit slow, so be prepared for that. We will be back to try them again and will try some other things."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to my home so it is convenient. I've been coming here for years and service has been up and down but over the last few months the consistent direction has been down. We visited on a Thursday evening (about 5:30) and were seated promptly. Chips and salsa arrived quickly and were very tasty. Both the salsa and the bean dip were spicier than usual (I am a wimp with spicy foods-most people would probably say the spice level is average). After ten minutes passed with no server approaching, I began to worry. When the server arrived, after five minutes later, we ordered drinks and food. I mentioned that I was very thirsty as we had been eating (the now empty chips and salsa). At this point the server left but did not return with our drinks or any waters. We could see her in the restaurant but she would not make eye contact. The busser never refilled the chips and salsa-it was as if we were invisible. Finally, when she was serving the table next to us, I flagged our server down and asked if we could please get our drinks. She said that they were out of glasses! I asked if I could have a drink in a to-go cup or anything else as at this point I was very uncomfortable from the spicy salsa-she laughed and left. A full 30 minutes after we were seated she returned with our drinks! No apology for the wait, no mention of any issues. I asked her if the restaurant was having a problem this evening and she replied that they ran out of rice and cheese. How does a Mexican restaurant run out of rice and cheese??? And what does that have to do with clean cups? The food, when it finally arrived, was decent. Not spectacular but flavorful and well-prepared. Service at this restaurant has been sporadic over the years but after watching several other groups give up and leave their tables before their food arrived we wish we had done the same.  The real kicker came when we got our check with the sodas still on the bill! Sadly, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant since it opened 15 years ago.  Food is not bad and prices fair.  This place has so much potential to be much more as a neighborhood favorite.  Patio is so nice but lacks attention.  Wait staff is nice but the turnover seems frequent.  They have a large room on the west side that is never used.  What a great place for them to offer special events to get more local support.  
My recommendations:
1. Prices for liquor not good....needs improvement.
2. Bar is too small.
3. Needs music to add to the experience.
4. Cater to your neighbors....great potential.
5. Change up the menu.
If you have been there, make comments. Could be a home run!!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this restaurant, I really did.  The outside patio looks like a place I'd like to be at.  But the food is mediocre at best.  I had the carnitas chimichanga, and it was just ok.  The chips and salsa were good, but chips & salsa do not a meal make.  Wont be back, and I really wanted to kick it on the patio."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the ground beef burrito and the tortilla was extremely dry, as if they had 5 week old flour tortillas in the back waiting to be served to me. I also ordered a Dos Equis and it wasn't cold. Warm beer and dry burritos isn't something that my stomach agrees with. Not to mention, they didn't inform us that the bar was closing, so we couldn't order more drinks. I was not satisfied with the quality of the food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My family of five ate at La Casa Blanca this evening. We have three small children, but I was told, from numerous people, that considering the location (smack down in the middle of suburbia), kids go all the time and it's \"kid-friendly.\" So, when we walked in, I was happy to see many tables with small children as well. Although I did notice two things right away: (1) it was very LOUD (not necessarily \"kid\" loud, but just \"restaurant\" loud) and (2) nobody had any food on their tables. We should've left. But, we stayed. We immediately got served chips and salsa (quite delicious) but then it took the server another 5-10 minutes to take our drink order (and then ANOTHER 15 to actually get our adult drinks). I did have an infant (16 months) who would periodically scream. Yes, it was annoying. Why didn't I take him outside, you might ask? Well, (1) Was he cranky/fussing? No. (2)Were we at a swanky place with white tablecloths and no children around? No. (3) Was it so quiet in the restaurant that nothing else could be heard but this one child? No. (4) Was I hoping beyond hope that our food would arrive and thus, appease the child? Yes. Other children (not my own) were crying, talking, laughing...you know, things that young children do. It's in South Chandler, people. We have kids. Part of the problem was that it took *45* minutes to get our food! My kids were hungry. Before that, however, the manager came over and had the nerve to tell my baby to be quiet. So, the management did say something, but she had absolutely no tact. Then, when our food finally came, my 3 year old's grilled cheese was cold. So were the french fries. If he wasn't three and couldn't care less, I would've sent it back. The cheese was rubbery and orange, obviously sitting under a heat lamp for, well, probably 45 minutes. Then, the shrimp tacos? Really? Tiny, tiny, frozen shrimp, with gloppy creamy sauce on them. Not good. My husband's tostada shell? Couldn't even eat it...it was STALE. I thought we were being punked. Finally, when the management came over and asked \"How everything was?\" I told her that (1) she was quite rude and unprofessional and (2) the food was terrible. \"I'm sorry to hear that. I need to keep EVERYBODY happy,\" she says. We live right around the corner and I was SO disappointed in this place and, most of all, the rude service, that I created this yelp account and wrote this review up the same evening. A positive thing to say about the place: it's a really cute Spanish style building w/ an amazing patio. But, save your money, angst, and time. Take a picture of the place and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Done!!!  This used to be one of the best Mexican Food restaurants in Chandler...but no more!  We had noticed months ago it was going down hill, but decided to give it another shot tonight!  BIG MISTAKE,HUGE!!!!!  We got to the restaurant at 6:10 pm and once someone finally noticed us standing in the entry, were seated in a timely manner. But that's where it went south!!!  When our waitress finally showed up and asked for our drink order, she almost ran off immediately before we could request a cheese crisp as an appetizer!  It took at least 15 minutes (possibly longer) for the appetizer to finally arrive. We had already placed our food order and were joking about everything coming out at the same time!  Wrong!!!!  We never got our food (two tacos and an enchilada). The waitress tried to give us our check and we had to remind her we had ordered food!  Twenty-five minutes later we got up and went to the front. Requested our check and a manager. To his credit he comped our appetizer and drinks (tea and soda) but tried to make excuses and wasn't apologizing for the length of time it took to get NOTHING!  Like I said...\"done\"!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight.  We wanted some place local and he was in the mood for Mexican.  We used to come here fairly regularly but it has been several years since the last time we came.  It looks beautiful outside, they added a covering t the patio and it looks like they painted and spruced up the place.  The inside is nothing special but definitely good enough.  We waited less than 5 minutes to be seated.  We had a good server.  The chips and bean dip are really good.  The food was good too.  It was good enough for my taste.. I am not a gourmet restaurant reviewer so it was fine by my standards.  Since we were out without our kids tonight we were really enjoying just sitting and chatting.  However, we didn't want to linger so after we paid the check we sat outside in the courtyard area under the trees on a bench swing.  It was beautiful and quiet.  Overall, I like this place and would go back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by some family members, so my girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot. OMG...this place was truly amazing. The food was awesome (shredded chicken chimichanga) and staff was spot-on with their service. We will definitely be going back...very soon!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Prettiest outdoor seating in Chandler, in my opinion.  Fast, casual service.  Family atmosphere.  Can be pretty pricey, but it's worth it.  Best bean dip around.  STRONG and good margaritas.  Nice place to take people from out of town where you can linger over dinner outside."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here last night. She told me she came here once before and doesn't remember it being more than decent, but decided to give it another try. The outside is so pretty at night with all of the lights! We were seated and started with complimentary chips and salsa and beans. A little on the salty side. The house margarita was really good though! I ordered the carne asada tacos and my mom ordered the sopitas. She said they were okay. I enjoyed my tacos and had a bunch leftover. The place seemed relatively unorganized but I guess that might be characteristic of a small business sometimes. This place was decent overall. Margaritas out on the patio would be nice if I come back."}
{"text":"My palate would say this place is mediocre at best. My digestive tract would declare, \"stay away!\" Yuck. I was a patron here one time...and I believe it will stay that way."}
{"text":"I can't imagine anyone giving this restaurant less than 5 stars. I've spent the last year, since moving here from California, trying to find a good Mexican place and I am happy to say, my search ends here.
The service was excellent (I forgot to ask for no lettuce on the kids' tacos... I started to pick it off and the waiter pretty much demanded he have them re-made without lettuce).
Our drinks were always full, food was hot, and the CHIPS & SALSA were AWESOME! Chips were flaky and hot. The salsa had a good spice to it, and the bean dip was my favorite!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came in on a Sunday at dinner time, the restaurant was pretty full and lively. The server was prompt, our drinks, chips, salsa and bean dip came right out. My wife loved the bean dip, the salsa was just spicy enough. The margaritas are nothing special, too much 'sour' but that is nit picking - they are okay... The entres were average at best. My wife had the shrimp tacos - some of the shrimp looked grilled, others, not as grilled - like they made them in different batches. After eating one taco my wife couldn't take any more and left the second one - just not very good. I ordered a beef burrito - what came out was a rice burrito with a couple tablespoons of grey meet. I got the green chiles and cheese 'inside', the chiles were very good - the cheese was one lump in the middle of the burrito, not even melted. To their credit, they took my aweful burrito off the bill... The food is overpriced for what you get as well. After numerous 'luke warm experiences, we sadly decided this was our last trip to our local restaurant. SE Chandler is a 'black hole' when it comes to dining out - we will drive further north from now on, sorry to see this place continues to underwhelm."}
{"text":"So after visiting this establishment a few times with my family , I thought I'd take my wife on a date here for a quick dinner.  Well it will be the last time I ever go here and I'll make sure to spread the word of how distasteful, dishonest and rude we were treated.  
We ordered two meals from our waitress whom after having someone else deliver the food we had to wait 15 minutes for her to come back and check on us.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all.  This I don't mind but what I will share next was appalling.
We ask for our check which should have been $26.51and it was when she brought it over.  I put my credit card on the tray and she take the card and returns a few minutes later.  The bill went up from the original $26.51 to $31.61. So I asked her why it went up from the time she took the card until the time she returned.  She said \"I don't know , but it's been adding taxes twice lately!\"  My response- \"So knowing this wouldn't you either use a different terminal, double check the amount prior to bringing back to your customers or get it fixed?\"  She chuckled and said \"well if you want I can see what happened\"?

Seriously? Come one. First off yes it's a few dollars, but it's the fact that they knew about it.  So she comes back and the charge is still different however, it was lesser than the second charge.  I asked to speak with the manager.  Some guy in street clothes, backwards baseball cap, and very disheveled came over and said \"Hi, what's wrong?\"   
I stated what happened and he said \"sir there isn't anything I can do!\"   I said \"you charged me twice, cancel them both and do it for the correct amount\"!
He said he couldn't do that and they would drop off tomorrow.   
My response\"what is my reassurance that this will happen?\"  He said \"well nothing but you can drive back tomorrow and dispute it!\"
Seriously - come one I'd have to drive 45 minutes to dispute your screw up and then the moral principle that I was lied to and if I didn't see this then you would be making more money from me! How many other customers has this happened to that have not caught it and you have charged extra too?  
I signed the receipt with this- \"this is not an authorized charge and any attempt to charge me for these amount will be an act of fraud.\"  He looked at me like I had ten heads and said sir you still need to pay.


Holy moly are you still serious right now????!!!
Wouldn't you as a manager not charge the Patron, apologize for the lies and hassles and tell them you would love to remedy this quickly so you return???

I will not let this go.  It's not the matter of the money but again the matter of principle.  Don't lie and try to cover it up.  Don't harass your patrons when you made the mistakes.   Save a customer and apologize.  
I have 150k followers on my blogs.  If they do not remedy this situation then I will blog about it and bring awareness to the incorrect charges that perhaps others have not noticed, and ensure to tell everyone that this establishment does care about their patrons merely getting you in and out in hopes you don't check you bill.


Yes in the past the experience was ok. Nothing to write home about.   

Suggestions to the owners- have your managers in professional attire or restaurant attire at least.  Tell you wait staff to smile more and check on their tables more than every 10-15 minutes.  Make suggestions of what good or specials of the day, and for god sake stop letting them lie to your customers because they don't have a clue."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars I would have done that.

Let me first say that we have been here many times and I have even reserved the back room for my wife's birthday. The food has always been decent and service good, but tonight was a completely different experience.

We arrived at 6:30 and the place looked busy, but not so busy and we were able to be seated right away. We placed our orders and then we waited...and waited...and waited. an hour later our server came back and let us know that our food would be out \"soon\". We had our baby with us so at that point we just wanted to get our food and take it to go. But then he disappeared for another 20 minutes and we still had no food. We saw food come out and other tables (that had arrived after us) were being served, but none of our food had come out.

When we finally got our food the order was incomplete. I got my food, which I went about boxing so that we could get going (home), but my wife's meal was MIA. I asked for our portion of the check and we waited some more. Another 20 minutes past and my wife's meal finally came, but was incorrect. She ordered corn tortillas and got flour; she has a gluten allergy and I explained that to the server, but he was unapologetic and stated \"if she doesn't have celiacs disease then she can just push the food off the wheat tortilla\". I told him we won't be doing that and asked him to take the dish back and have it changed to corn. There was further discussion about how \"it was fine\" and that \"I should just take the food\"...he finally reluctantly took the food back. We waited some more.

At this point my wife and I had had it and we just wanted to leave (without the food) I asked for my credit card back at the front desk (our server had once again disappeared) but the server had the card still. When I finally saw him, he said the food was on it's way. I told him we wanted none of it and we just wanted my card back so that we could go home. I asked if he had charged the card and he said \"no\".

When I got home, low and behold there was a hold charge for la Casa Blanca.

Needless to say we will never be back. I'm not sure what happened to this place, but no one apologized once, not even the manager.

My advice, avoid like the plague, especially on busy nights."}
{"text":"My husband and found this place a few months ago.  The food was great so, we returned several times.  It wasn't until our last three trips that it all turned sour for us.  The service was slow and I mean no refills on drinks, food came out after long time etc.  What irritated me the most was our last visit.  The place was busy as usual and we waited to order drinks, then our food and then NOTHING.  The waiter never came back!!!  We found out later he walked off the job with two other servers.  Our food came out and it was cold.  Then we needed drink refills and nobody came by the table.  Then we just wanted our check as we had friends with us and their was no service.  My husband finally flagged another guy down, after an hour of waiting and asked for a bill.  NOTHING!!! It wasn't until we were ready to walk out that he said to the supervisor at the hostess stand"}
{"text":"La Casa Blanca, spanish for...\"the white house\" is not your average mexican restaurant. You enter from the rear, yes a rare rear entry. 

The back patio is massive, quaint yet needs some pep. Once you walk through the front door there is a large bird cage to your right. Make sure you get a close look at these strange creatures. We tried to get them to talk but to our dismay they were silent. The quietest birds I have ever seen!

The decor inside is very authentic mexican, especially the bathrooms. If you are expecting Abuelas like atmosphere you will be dissapointed. Its much darker and less asthetics. The booths are fine but the tables could be improved (wobbly etc.).

We were greeted and sat quickly. It took a few minutes before our waitor arrived. The service was fairly friendly but very young and could use more training. They have separate runners for chips, bean dip and salsa. This allows the waitors to focus on drinks and food orders. 

The food was really surprisingly good and appropriately priced. I had the three item combo, crunchy beef taco, tamale and the beef enchilda. The beef was cooked just right, not mooshy and very well spiced. The shredded lettuce was very fresh a crisp. The refried beans were perfect texture and even had some flavor (most i've had are very bland). My wife had something very unique (at least to us) called Sopanadas. They were two corn patties with shredded chicken, lettuce and salsa on them. Really good! The chips were thick and warm. The salsa was not chunky and the bean dip was tasty. Nothing was real hot but did have some spice.

In all, the place is a 3.0 for atmosphere, 3.5 for service and 4.5 for food (for us dog). Definitely worth checking out if you like authentic mexican food and are in the area."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! The staff are always so nice and polite; this is a one of our favorite places to take out of town guests! Plus we keep coming back for more in between our guests, always leave La Casa Blanca full and happy"}
{"text":"Love the chips, salsa and bean dip!!! When I craving good Mexican food this is the first place I think of!"}
{"text":"We have been frequent customers of this neighborhood restaurant.... until the last two visits.  After tonight's dinner, I am no longer going to dine there.

I ordered the shrimp fajitas, which came out with dried up over done shrimp.  Every one of them, don't know if they were old freezer burned shrimp or if the cook just cooked them to death.  I told the server when she came over to ask how the meal was, and she said \"oh, I'm sorry\" and then just stood there silent.  Finally she said \"do you want me to get the manager?\"
Really? How about you offer to cook up some not so dried up shrimp or offer something else in it's place?
The staff seemed very young and inexperienced, we overheard them arguing behind the entranceway desk about putting another server outside.

My dish was never replaced, we paid the bill in full and left saying we will never return.

Oh, and the visit prior - my credit card number was stolen and used in Mexico a day later."}
{"text":"Just had Father's Day lunch here. Enjoyed the food but not great service. Our server rarely came over. I was thirsty for more water 90% of the meal. Needed more salsa and had to ask someone else because our server was nowhere to be found. I get it when things are busy you cannot be everywhere but she didn't even acknowledge that we were clearly being neglected. That was my first time so could have been random bad experience."}
{"text":"So so food...but I liked the patio.  Better food, and cheaper, can be had at Elmers or Filibertos."}
{"text":"This place is a terrible excuse for a restaurant..  Service, poor, food below average and the management is very unprofessional.  They would rather argue that the food is good rather than accommodate unhappy guests.  

BTW dont order the shrimp tacos, they are tiny canned or freeze dried and nasty!

Dont waste your time or money!  Thank god this is not a chain..."}
