{"text":"On Monday May 2, 2016 I went online to order from wing spot, I then proceeded to order their \"lunch special\" which consisted of 6 wings, fries and a drink I then selected a pick up time for 4:30 pm. Wing stop called me at 4:23 pm on my way to the restaurant to ask me how many wings I wanted. I proceed to tell the young lady that I ordered the special and she then again asked me how many wings I wanted. I then asked her how many wings the special came with she then put me on hold to consult with someone else who works there. She came back on the phone and then explained that the special was wings and a pizza, I explained to her that the lunch special came with wings, fries and a drink. She then placed me back on hold and went to talk to someone else who there again, the young lady came back on the phone to tell me that no one that worked there knew what I was talking about. I'm just confused as to how an restaurant has a menu and an online ordering system and they don't even know their own menu, it's ridiculous."}
{"text":"My family and I have ate here almost every week since they opened!! The wings are huge and delicious! Most of my friends have tried and loved their wings! We now how game nights and it's a must to have their wings!! Our family and friends favorite is honey bbq and the cheddar bacon ranch!! When they first opened they had minor issues with the staff but since then have turned it around!"}
{"text":"I saw the one star review and immediately had to create an account and leave a review of my own. This is NOT a one star wing joint in any way, shape, or form. I don't go out to eat often, and being new to the east side of town I don't know a lot of the \"hot spots\" in the area. I saw an article in The News-Herald about Wing Spot's new location and after seeing the photo in the paper I was sold. I placed an order for a dozen honey buffalo wings with extra sauce and headed to pick up my order. I got there a little early, and my wings still had a few minutes. The girl at the counter was friendly and the owner was good about making sure I was taken care of. When I got home, I opened the box and was happy with the product, the wings were smothered in sauce with a small cup of extra sauce on the side. The wings were big and meaty, and the sauce was just the right amount of spicy and sweet. I took my time eating them and savored the flavor. I will definitely be back and will drag some friends with me the next time I go. I hope John J. gives Wing Spot another shot. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The spicy bourbon wings are OMG DELICIOUS!!! So are the fresh cut fries.   I will definitely be back or in search of the Jackpot Chicken truck."}
