{"text":"Wonderful crepe! I had the ham and cheddar - the cheddar was really amazing and the consistency of the crepe was perfect. The owner is so kind and it's just a fun place."}
{"text":"This is an old town new gem....in a world of plastic bread tasteless fillings and haphazard coffee I was treated to a delicious sandwich and latte. The owner is passionate about good real food and was really friendly and relaxed. I will make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"If you're lucky enough to get to go here and you're the only customer, you'll have the treat of having Jane all to yourself, she is an absolute doll. Some time during our visit the shop might as well transformed into Jane's kitchen and we were some old friends enjoying some of her home cooking...the savory crepes are delicious, and the ham is hand cut.   Go there, meet Jane and eat...thank me later."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were looking for some desert and coffee after visiting the art galleries on Main St. After walking around the block, we found this little coffee shop tucked inside the alley. The owner just moved from London and has only been opened for 3 weeks. Her vision is to bring a little bit of Europe to Scottsdale. I had a Nutella and banana crepe with espresso. My daughter had an Oreo gelato. It was good! Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Came from an event at the park close by-- not even sure I was in the mood for crepes. Thanks to Yelp an excellent choice. Satisfying & different for lunch and gelato for dessert. Perfect. Love the owner Jane's British accent and heart!"}
{"text":"The cafe's name says it all. Everything get's top marks. Gourmet teas, coffee, sandwiches, croissantwiches, (i made that one up, but they make them here), gelato and crepes, and service. Seriously, great service is all they know. And, for the finicky crepe eater who must have their crepe not too under done but tender and just right, you've come to the right place. Had the savory turkey crepe with pesto, British cheddar cheese, tomato and avocado....(daydreaming of that) Don't even try to ask for a better mouthwatering treat. Except for the roasted marshmallow or chocolate gelato, get that after and thank them for their contribution to world peace (ok, that's a stretch but if everyone was as lovely as they are, we'd be on our way) so maybe just thank them for the happiness in your tummy."}
{"text":"Just found this place. Absolutely love it. gelato and Cubano coffee served by the friendly shop owner Jane Marks"}
{"text":"After wandering around Olds Scottsdale and trying to find a decent place to eat, I found this place on Yelp. So my family and I rushed here... I fell in love with a simple salmon and cream cheese bagel sandwich I saw on the Yelp photos. It was heaven! I also had a coffee which was tasty. My family all had a variety of crepes; a vegetarian one, a turkey and veggies one, a bacon one, and a salmon one. They loved them! We inhaled our food. And soon after we all had some gelato. The gelato was really phenomenal! They even offer gelato milkshakes. My brother had one and he loved it. I tried and loved the strawberry gelato and s'mores gelato. This place really is something special. Kind of hidden gem away from many shops, but the customer service along with the delicious food absolutely made my day. When I visit Olds Scottsdale again I plan to return here."}
{"text":"Yelp is a lie. Not sure about the gelato but crepe is pretty bad... Microwaved egg, near to no taste for a savory crepe i ordered and it's very dry. Doesn't look too tasty either... Also overpriced for what's being offered... Would not come again..."}
{"text":"Top Marks cafe has the best coffee, crepes, and gelato in old town. I loved the turkey and pesto crepe and my daughter loved the Nutella and gelato one. We stopped in almost everyday while we were visiting, just so I could have their coffee and my daughter could have the gelato. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little eatery just off the street in Old Town Scottsdale. It is run by a fabulously friendly woman from the U.K. Who obviously loves taking care of others. We are here two times during our stay and both times were amazing. Crepes, paninis, bagels, gelato or coffees - she does them all. Service is above and beyond! We will come again when we are on this side of town again."}
{"text":"The crepes are amazing. Must try british chedder and egg. The gelato and afogato are perfect after. Try the prickly pear gelato!"}
{"text":"If you are in Old Town Scottsdale,  stop by here for a quick bite.  Excellent food, exemplary service.  A little hidden away, but worth the search.  Top Marks, indeed."}
{"text":"This the fifth time I have visited Top Marks Cafe. Jane, the owner never disappoints. The turkey avocado crepe was crisp, warm and delicious. My only regret is that I didn't leave room for the yummy gelato!"}
{"text":"What a delightful experience this was!  The food was fresh and delicious. My bacon, tomato, egg salad sandwich on a croissant was truly a taste treat. The thing that sets this café apart from the others is the relaxed, friendly atmosphere. The owner, Jane, will greet you and make you feel at home. You'll find that she truly cares about her customers."}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs on croissant breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. The owner Jane is very friendly and just opened the cafe recently. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of lost in the other shops in Old Town. I actually didn't want to go in because it didn't have the look, but boy I was happy we did at the end.  When we walked in mid-afternoon, it was pretty dead. I was a bit dubious, but the woman working inside welcomed us and had this nice British accent. Since we had lived in the UK for 5 years, we struck up a conversation and decided to stay. After talking through the menu items, we decided to split the Turkey avocado cheddar crepe, which was excellent! Very fresh with the right blend of ingredients.  We finished up with some gelato, of course and left very pleased."}
{"text":"For not eating crepes very much, the savory crepes (turkey melt) blew my mind. The gelato was homemade by an Italian family and tastes like it! Delicious! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I have been back many times and tried the breakfast crepe. Hot chocolate to die for..."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here after shopping at the farmers market and SO glad we did. The banana and Nutella crepe was absolutely delicious and portioned out just right so as to not make it overly rich. We'll definitely be back to try some of the savory selections and enjoy the company of Jane the owner. Very friendly and will do anything to make your experience there an enjoyable one."}
{"text":"I'm only 110% sure I died here. For starters, their logo is a penguin holding an ice cream cone. I don't think it gets better than that. It's a little tricky to find (not directly on the main street) but I'd recommend searching for this place all day rather than settling for something else.  Top Marks Cafe has 26 flavors of gelato. Unfortunately, their freezer broke the night before we went and only had 6 flavors available. Even from the 6 options, it was a very difficult decision to make! Their gelato is locally made and you can taste the freshness and creaminess in every bite.   I got the Afogato (gelato + espresso) with the Dulce de Leche gelato and it was too perfect. The balance between the sweetness from the gelato and sharpness from the espresso made me want to order a second one! My friends got a couple of their crepes as well: Pesto and Marmelaide. The quality of the crepe alone was so rich and the fillings only made it that much better."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my new favorite cafes!! Try the affogato with the vanilla or the coffee flavored gelato! The owner is just wonderful to talk to, can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm  Growing up in Italy it's hard to find good gelato in the states. Best thing about this place, few of the flavors are so true to authentic gelato it's refreshing. The lemon is tart, not sweet and that is 100% how every place is in Italy and you don't find it overly tart anywhere else. The chocolate is made without milk so it's rich and delicious. The best thing of all the other flavors, they were true to taste. The marshmallow tastes liked like a freshly roasted campfire marshmallow, smores you could taste the graham cracker, and the vanilla.....man o man best hands down. You don't get flavors like this everywhere.  Also so many of these flavors are dairy free and everything is all nautical flavors. Truly unique place."}
{"text":"This place is great. From the amazing service(Always with a smile) to the flavored gelato and tasty food. I am really recommending to visit here just make sure you check openings before because they are closed at the summer time."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes, the cheese is unbelievably good. We stumbled on this place in a alley of old town Scottsdale.  Jane is very friendly and inviting. She serves crepes, sandwiches and good coffee. And ice cream!!!!  It's cheap and very cheerful."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Friendly! Delicious!   I am a connoisseur of small cafés and this one definitely gets put in my \"come back and visit anytime I am in town again\" column!  I ordered a stracciatella gelato and a vanilla latte.  Both were delicious.  I enjoyed the gelato sitting outside at a nice little area in the alley where the café is located.  It has plenty of shade so you can get out of the heat when it is sunny.    One of the things I like best about small cafés is their attention to detail and customer service. I met the lady running the store today and she invited me right in and was friendly from the get-go. It's the warm invitation that makes me feel welcome and makes me want to come back again, not to mention the quality of the gelato and coffee.   Fellow yelpers, coffee lovers and gelato aficionados, give this place a look!"}
{"text":"What a nice experience we had at Jane's little restaurant. We need a something light to tide us over so had a spinach, tomato and goat cheese crepe and topped it off with some delicious gelato and sorbet.   It is the perfect place to stop and refresh yourself with delightful treats."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, fantastic and friendly service from the owner Jane... so glad we followed the reviews to this great gem! I enjoyed a turkey pesto crepe and a combo of pumpkin and pistachio gelato. I marked this as a favorite and will definitely be back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Quaint little cafe with great service and eats.  The tiramisu gelato was amazing and try the lemon flavored if you like citrus based deserts. Good coffee. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Great coffee and Crepes just like Paris. The proprietor is really sweet running around with her English accent. She is quite a character and I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was so refreshing to have a true European eating experience in Old Town Scottsdale! Jane was incredibly welcoming and sweet (she speaks French, too!) and I can tell she puts TLC into her menu and her business. I had a bacon/tomato/egg sandwich on a croissant, which was delicious and took me back to my time in European eateries! I'll definitely be back to check out their gelato and crepes, too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic crepe & a really friendly owner.  Great little spot tucked away in a lovely courtyard.  Oh, and wonderful gelato too."}
{"text":"It is tiny and tucked away- but an excellent find! We stumbled across it after the Scottsdale Parada del Sol parade. It was quit busy for such a tiny spot- but they were on spot in customer service and quick food service.  We were greeted by the owner, a very pleasant Brit with a fabulous demeanor. She was very engaging with each and every customer that came through.   Most of our group had crepes.  They offer sweet and savory crepes, along with crepes that are sweet & savory.   I had the bacon-turkey-cheese melt. Oh my goodness. It was delish! The crepe was firm and yet light. The filling was fresh, hot and flavorful. The crepe was very filling. Another member of our group had the special- bananas and bacon crepe with maple syrup.  I don't recall what the others had, but everyone was thrilled with their selections. One member tried a panini. He said it was the best one he's had in a long time. One member ordered a shake. They sell Gelato as well, and that is what was used in the shake. Hand scooped and blended to order topped with whip cream. It was so thick- she could \"eat it\" with a fork.   This is definitely on our return visit list. It was so good, and such an inviting atmosphere.   It is tucked away in an ally of shops, so you won't spot it from the street.  Parking in Old Town is often difficult, but this place is so worth the effort.  And Old Town is a lovely area to stroll around in. You never know what other treasures you will find."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing little hole-in-the-wall! Jane, who owns it is the cutest lady ever.   I always get the salmon and horseradish crepe and it's heaven. The salmon is flown in and is just so fresh!  I've had a couple friends try the turkey avocado cheese and pesto crepe and it's also SO good!!"}
{"text":"I still remember the owner of this cafe ! It's been nearly a year since coming here yet her hospitality and her willingness to go above and beyond has stuck with me!  Delicious food. Excellent cafe. And superb customer service.   All these elements make for a great dining experience thanks again Jane ! Hope all is well your friends from Chicago!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little brunch spot. Food, coffee, and service are amazing. I ordered the Carmel latte and the turkey avocado pesto crepe but added bacon and loved it! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious crepe! I suggest you try the var salmon crepe, it was amazing!! Sarah made our crepe and was SO nice! Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place! Fantastic food (try a gluten free crepe, the texture is amazing) and the owner, Jane, is an absolute delight. She is so accommodating, and you can tell she genuinely enjoys interacting with her customers. The coffee is great, and I'm going back to the the gelato before this trip is over."}
{"text":"What a charming place that is well done.  The menu items look delicious as well as the sandwich I had made for me.  I'm looking forward to having a crepe next!  Then as far as the gelato goes, every flavor looked amazing, but I settled on a banana/carmel/fudge flavor that left me wanting more.  I look forward to future returns when I am in the area.  Whether it is breakfast, lunch, or just a sweet flavor you need, It is a unique place with a unique menu worth trying, and it won't leave you poor."}
{"text":"LOVE this Top Marks Cafe. I ordered savory crepe with avocado, cheese, tomato and bacon, along with a cafe cubano, and dulce de leche gelato for dessert. I honestly haven't had a cubano this good since I was in Havana several years ago and I was thrilled to learn they have added several gelato flavors and now paninis !  As a resident of south scottsdale I am SO OVER these huge chain restaurants, with 400 television screens, deafening music, with shitty food, run by people who could hardly care about the experience being delivered. I adore coming to Top Marks for the quality of the food, the owner, and the vibe of the place. The owner Jane is from England; she is funny, warm, completely invested in top quality ingredients, and the cleanliness of the place. I love walking down the old saloon style corridor to reach the cafe, walking in the door and hearing her bellow \"Ello Dahling ! \". Huge charm this little nook---huge charm.  I generally dash in here to get coffee and snacks a couple times a week before hectic days; particularly when I need to be productive. Jane feeds my belly and my caffeine addiction, all within the context of community. By the end of my visit there, most of the customers are talking to each other, sharing their stories, and enjoying their experience. Lastly, the crowd is wonderfully international. It's a hoot to enjoy coffee and gelato while hearing about people's global experiences. Thank god for this place."}
{"text":"Wow!  Stumbled into this great place during the Parada del Sol and it was amazing!  Have been back to try different crepes already.  The gelato is awesome too!  The woman who runs this quaint cafe is super friendly and really does make some amazing sweet and savory crepes.  Can't wait to go back for another!  It is tucked into a little cove, so keep your eyes peeled when looking for it."}
{"text":"Such a lovely cafe in Old Town Scottsdale that serves all of my favorite things - crepes (savory and sweet), gelato and yummy beverages too!  The space is inviting and the owner was so welcoming to my husband, dog and I.  The strawberry confiture crepe (my choice) and the ham, British cheddar and poached egg crepe (hubby's choice) were fantastic - just like being in France!  We'll definitely come back next time to enjoy some locally made gelato...it looked so tempting in the case!"}
{"text":"The owner, Jane, is such a friendly and welcoming person! The food and sweets here are delicious! The poached egg sandwich and crepe are both delectable, and so, too, is the south African chocolate gelato."}
{"text":"We have visited Top Marks several times and have enjoyed both the food and the experience each time.  This coffee shop offers a unique European flair with fresh ingredients and lovely hospitality.  We plan to be regulars!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Just hearing Jane's wonderful English accent takes me back to the time I went to England with friends. The crepes are pretty outstanding.  We had the Val Salmon crepe for lunch and the Strawberries, Nutella and Bananas for dessert. Her lovely mum was there as well as some of her friends. Listening to all the jocularity and watching Jane be so gregarious with everyone and eating our crepes just made me so happy! Crepes are my comfort food and Top Mark's Cafe hit my cravings for crepes right on the spot. My decaf Mocha was great too!"}
{"text":"One of the best Crepes in AZ! This place is delicious, the owner ensures all her menu items are fresh, healthy, and she has many Gluten free, non-gmo options. I ordered a savory and sweet crepe, both we delicious. Portions are generous and the price is very reasonable. The owner runs the cafe and she provides 5 star service-- I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best smoked salmon I have ever had! Also highly recommend the Cafe Cubano. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other things on the menu. Atmosphere is fun and comfortable and the owner makes you feel like a family member. This is truly a hidden gem in old town Scottsdale. Highly recommended ..."}
{"text":"I got the poached egg and avocado  sandwich and the execution didn't quite live up to my expectations. Nevertheless this was just my first experience and there is enough on the menu and enough positive feedback on Yelp to merit future visits and a likely bump in the rating."}
{"text":"First time at this little cafe! Very charming interior and the staff is pleasant. We ordered the turkey & avocado crepe and shared it! It was very delicious and satisfying for the two of us to share! It wasn't very pretty to look at but the flavor was delicious!! A nice little place to have a casual meal in Old Town Scottsdale! Close to the park so you can take a little stroll after you dine!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious crepes.  I just had the roasted turkey, English cheddar and bacon crepe.... It was amazing.  Their gelato is also great.  My favorites are the blood orange and Reese's....and they're organic.  If you haven't been to Top Marks Cafe you're missing out!  You'll love the food/gelato selection and it's got a very nice and relaxed atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back:)."}
{"text":"What a terrific surprise.  Gelato is superior. Service excellent. This is a great place to stop in and cool off.  They have a uniquely European menu.  We didn't try the sandwiches, but they looked good and folks at other tables appeared to really enjoy."}
{"text":"What a gem, especially in this area that is so commercial, Jane has made her place warm and welcoming. Her sandwiches are fantastic, gelato flavors yummy and coffee very good. We had the extra pleasure of meeting her parents while we were eating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a crepe and discovered this cafe through the Yelp reviews. Since we were close to Old Town Scottsdale, we decided to try them out and the food was delicious!  The owner as others had mentioned was very nice and friendly!  I ordered the Italian Ham Cheddar Fried Egg crepe and my husband had the applesauce caramel crepe which were both fabulous. We will come back in the future to try out the other crepes."}
{"text":"Stopped by for coffee was pleasantly surprised to find an assortment of delicious favors of gelato that my family loved. The owner Jane runs the shop and is very welcoming and makes sure you leave her place happy. She uses Lavazza coffee and definitely cuts no corners. A must stop for anyone visiting old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My friends and I check out new crepe places around town once a month.... and this is by far my favorite we have been to so far! Jane uses such fresh, natural ingredients with a great combination of flavors. Not to mention, amazing gelato (I had the Ferrero Rocher- MUST HAVE).   But the thing that made the place most amazing was the level of service. My friends and I arrived a few minutes before Jane was about to close up- she had already turned all of her Equiptment off for the night... however, quickly turned everything on and accommodated our every need! She was very patient, friendly, and wonderful to get to know... I would highly recommend you try this place and support our wonderful local businesses in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get something to tide me over before an early dinner and the British Cheddar and Fried Egg Crepe hit the spot! Jane is beyond friendly and makes you feel like you've known her forever!"}
{"text":"We were searching for a delicious place to have coffee and something to eat for breakfast. This is the place!! Jane, the owner, made fresh hot coffee that was delicious. We also had crepes that were amazing!!!! My crepe has two poached eggs, bacon, and British cheddar. In the afternoon, we came back for gelato and were not disappointed. Definitely the best food we've had in the area and a nice break from tourist trap mediocre restaurants."}
{"text":"We didn't anticipate how crowded Old Towne Scottsdale would be on a Sunday morning for breakfast. My family of 6 was able to be seated and be fed VERY WELL at this crepe and sandwich shop.  The owner is a delightful Brit who makes a heck of a brunch!"}
{"text":"The reviews are spot on.  The food is great.  I had the turkey bacon crepe and it was delicious. The latte was wonderful, but save room for the gelato.  WOW made near by from an Italian family. It was amazing.  The owner is one of the nicest people that you will ever meet.  Wish I came to AZ more often.  The shop is a little tucked away so if you miss it swing back around."}
{"text":"Great great food and even better service. The crepes are filling and full of fresh ingredients. Fluffy and light and flavorful."}
{"text":"We rode our bikes to Old Town Scottsdale to Top Marks (based on Yelp reviews). We were not disappointed. It was like walking into Mom's kitchen....we were greeted like family. The salmon bagel was outstanding!  I had a turkey crepe with pesto and cheddar cheese. Wow!  So so so yummy!!  We will be back (maybe next weekend)!  This is a must stop location."}
{"text":"It's hidden but the cleanliness, quality ingredients and the lovely owner is worth tracking it down.  We just ordered espresso, but the gelato and crepes looked amazing."}
{"text":"Great place tucked away in Old Town. We had a couple of really nice crepes and some homemade gelato. The owner is also incredibly friendly and as it was quiet we had a nice chat about back home (both being British)!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, Jane made us feel like family. As first-time guests, I can guarantee we'll be regulars now. Her warm, English welcome and goodies from across the pond are quaint and welcome in Old Town.   We had a baby with us and Jane generously offered to hold her while we snacked on gelato and crepes. Positively lovely experience in itself.   The gelato comes from a nearby, local family and is simply delicious. There are plenty of crepes to select from or she'll do a custom one based on ingredients. They're made right in front of you and quite tasty.   This gem is hidden in the back of the Frontier boardwalk area on Main so don't miss out on it because if you walk on by, you'll surely miss out on a great experience."}
{"text":"After my IV infusion, we ventured around Old Town Scottsdale and found this Cafe serving French Crepes, Italian Coffee, Gelato and Italian Panini Sandwiches. To my heart's delight they have gluten-free crepes. I haven't eaten crepes for ages after I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease. Jane, the owner had it made in a designated gluten-free crepe maker and assured me that I will not get sick, very accomodating and knowledgeable! I savored every bite of it because it was so delicious! I was in food haven .  Hours later and true to her words, I did not get sick. Jane, you made my day! We will be back again."}
{"text":"Cute little gem tucked away in the back. The crepes are ah-mazing! The Nutella is melted inside the crepe, which I hadn't experienced before. Oh, boy I was missing out. I loved how warm and gooey it was, especially mixed with the bananas. The caramel latte was delicious as well. Jane is the owner, and her London hospitality is superb :)  very sweet and sociable. This European cafe gets a perfect score from me!"}
{"text":"So delicious. Great service. We had the turkey crepe and a poached egg sandwich. Both hit the spot."}
{"text":"Very cute place in old town . The owner is super friendly and helpful!  I had freshly made crepe with gelato and a latte .  They have so many different cool flavored I want to try!   I'm happy that I found a place I can get quick sweet tooth fix.   Expresso gelato is dellllliiccciiiooous"}
{"text":"Delicious. We went here after reading the great yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. We walked in right before the cafe opened and the owner was still setting up, even though we were early she was incredibly welcoming and made us drinks right away. I had the turkey bacon crepe and my boyfriend has the Italian ham and egg, both were incredible. We didn't have the gelato but I have a severe nut allergy and loved that each flavor was marked with any allergens, really thoughtful. Definitely stop in if in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to Old Town Scottsdale!  Great cafe with a European flare!  The smoked salmon sand which with onions and capers was wonderful.  The salmon is flown in fresh from the Pharaoh Islands. Can't wait to try the gelato and crepes!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Such good food! The crepes are  made perfectly!  And the service is just as good! I felt like I was in my Moms kitchen! The owner Jane is so kind!"}
{"text":"Wonderful cuisine and the most friendly business owner. A hidden gem!  Try the crepes with an egg. Delicious! And gelato....need I say more?"}
{"text":"Loved this cafe...the owner is so delightful! So warm and welcoming, you can't help but want to stay and chat with her. I had an iced coffee and African chocolate gelato, both were delicious. I'm picky about both, so I was very pleasantly surprised that both reminded me of my favorites from back home. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The gelato is wonderful,  the crepes are simply amazing,  the areas lovely and the owner is just a treat. Trust me, try it."}
{"text":"This cafe gets top marks indeed. The crepes were delish, and the owner is delightful. I had the British ham, Italian cheddar and poached egg crepe. We got to watch her made every one. The ham was juicy, the cheese was perfectly melty, and the egg was an awesome explosion of flavor right in the middle of the crepe that made my whole day better.  It's tucked away on one of the streets of old town Scottsdale. There is some outdoor seating as well as indoor seating. Parking on the street is super easy."}
{"text":"Jane really knows how to treat her customers right! My friends and I were just being typical tourists in town when we needed a bite to eat. Stumbling across yelp, we located Top Marks Cafe as a highly reviewed establishment, and with good reason! Immediately upon entering we were greeted as if we entered someone's home and the personal hospitality is just something you won't find most other places. After careful inspection of the menu and available options, I decided to get a crepe with turkey melt and bacon, adding an additional fried egg to the mix. Delicious would be a huge understatement as the crepe's flavor was definitely savoury with every bite! It certainly filled me up and I was more than content with what I chose. I also grabbed an iced mocha and it was just perfect. I'm not usually a coffee enthusiast either, but Jane really made one heck of a coffee! After all that, I still had room for two scoops of amazing peanut butter cup gelato. Definitely get the waffle cone because it compliments the gelato greatly! Jane even sat down and talked to us and got to know us when she wasn't busy. Really made us feel special and not just a bunch of tourists. Will definitely visit again whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This is the best gelato and service in all of Scottsdale! A must do when in old town with kids!!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast crepe with guacamole was absolutely delicious! Lavazza espresso hit the spot. The owner was super nice and flexible with adjusting my dietary needs. Will be back here with friends soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes! The first thing I had after delivering my daughter at Scottsdale Osborne four months ago :)"}
{"text":"We sort of found this place by accident, as we wandered around the Scottsdale area.  It was an excellent find on a warm spring afternoon.  Delicious gelato (with lots of flavors to choose from), friendly staff, and good prices!  There were plenty of places to grab a seat and enjoy dessert in the cute interior.  It was also memorable enough that I will definitely stop by on my next trip to Scottsdale in March!  May look into trying some of the food this time as well because it sounds tasty!"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon. My sisters had just finished the heart walk downtown phx and really needed some food fast! We stopped in this adorable cafe and were greeted by a sweet English woman (owner I assume). We all got the avocado, tomato, pesto crepe. We were all impressed with how DELISH it was! It was tough deciding between a sweet crepe or gelato for dessert but with how hot it was outside we opted for gelato. That did not disappoint either! The meal totally hit the spot and we cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is owned by Jane, who keeps me coming back. Not only does she have an infectious personality, but the Gelato and Crepes are unreal. The Salted butterscotch Affogato is not on the menu, but needs to be in your life. Ask her to make you one! So amazing."}
{"text":"This was the perfect spot to stop into for a light bite. Sarah made us a delicious salmon crepe with sweet horseradish! The mint chip gelato was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"Owner was so nice and personable. We got to Top Marks practically as the doors opened and had a lovely and quick breakfast. We got the lemon crepe (which was too tart for my liking) and a breakfast sandwich on croissant. Definitely will be back when the crepe mood strikes and try a cinnamon sugar one. Also, the gelato is locally sourced and looked delicious!"}
{"text":"If you love small cafés with super nice people serving you super good food - then this is the place! We enjoyed a Nutella/banana crepe, lemon crepe and turkey, pesto, avocado crepe. All were delicious and prepared fresh. The iced lattes hit the spot with the caffeine we needed to start the day. We decided to return later to sample the gelato. Many flavors to choose from and so good. We highly recommend this place for your coffee, crepe and gelato needs!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place to stop for some gelato or a delicious lunch or snack in heart of beautiful historic downtown Scottsdale. Love it. I even met the owner when I was ordering my lunch and she is absolutely charming. Great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Rip off! I was charged $1.50 for powdered sugar, $1.50 for a squirt of lemon and $0.50 for canned whip cream on top of trying to charge me $2.00 extra thinking I wouldn't notice. Total came to be $15 for a mediocre crepe. Should have known since the place was empty."}
{"text":"Top notch service , incredibly tasty crepes  made fresh right in front of you!!! Fresh and scrumptous ingediants!. Whether you choose a savory, or a sweet, you cant go wrong and wont be disappointed.  The salmon used is by far the freshest and most delicious I've ever had. The lemon and powdered sugar crepe is heavenly.....  and oh my... you can have a  crepe with Tiramisu   Gelato on top!!! Oh my , Incredible! The Gelato is truly delicious !!!! Fresh, creamy and so many choices.  You must stop in and try."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee, crêperie, ice cream shop in old town Scottsdale. Great British food with the wonderful sense of owner's humer make my day memorable each time I am there."}
{"text":"Fabulous gelato and espresso. Welcoming and friendly service by Sarah. Wanted to meet Jane but she wasn't there when we stopped by. We had the coffee chocolate chip gelato which was super good. They serve Lavazza coffee which is really great and smooth. The cafe is in a lovely setting with plenty of seating and also serves paninis and crepes!"}
{"text":"Cute place nestled in Old Town. I had the salmon crepe and it was delicious. Lots of great gelato choices. Jane, the English owner/chef/one woman show, adds a flair not often found in typical American spots. Come in for a charming treat!"}
{"text":"The best crepes I have ever had and the friendliest service! The nutella and banana is to die for. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great sidewalk cafe for authentic European flair. Crepes were excellent. Gelato excellent. Coffees excellent. Jane the owner is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. My friends and I have been meaning to come back because it was so amazing the first time... both food AND service.   Jane can tell you everything about the ingredients she uses because she selects them herself! You can tell from the way she explains them that she takes quality seriously.   They have two types of crepes: sweet and savory.   Chicken, Avocado, Tomato, British Cheddar, Pesto (savory) - Delicious! Jane uses hormone-free chicken and organic avocados. She does not use a light hand with the ingredients. My crepe was stuffed (and so was I at the end)! Avocados (perfectly ripe), pesto, all the ingredients were excellent. Highly recommend to try this.   I had the salmon crepe the first time, and I almost ordered it again. For any salmon lovers, this won't disappoint. The combination with the horseradish sauce is perfect.   The store is maintained and run by Jane so she can close a little earlier than the stated business hours if it's slow. Try not to cut it too close to the end of the day. She did open the store back up for us the first time we were here though - thank you Jane! Per Jane, the store will be closed starting the end of May for 3 months so make sure you stop by before then!  I'll definitely be back to try the sweet crepes next time."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot. Wonderful treats. Coffee, gelato, sweets, sandwiches.  Everything handmade and terrific!!! A bit hidden but worth the effort."}
{"text":"Totally, 100% enjoyable. Jane is the owner and she was very attentive and so adorable. I had the ham, egg and cheese crepe to which I added bacon. Perfection. My niece had the specialty salmon, tomato and avocado. She loved it but said it was so big she couldn't finish it. Grammy had the same as me but added some lingonberry jelly. Oh so good. We had some homemade Gelato to top off our visit. As we were leaving, Jane asked us to please take some cookies due to the fact she was leaving for a month for her birthday, vacation etc... what a sweet little place. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for a midday snack and fell in love with the crepes. We had a sweet crepe: black cherry gelato with Nutella. It was phenomenal. It was heaven on earth. The owner, Jane, was so friendly and was willing to go off menu to satisfy our crepe craving.  The place was clean and neat. The menu was varied. Everything was wonderful! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We can give top marks to Jane the owner of Top Marks Cafe. Sensational gelato and the owner is going to be adding more café foods in the future. She is charming and friendly. Go try it"}
{"text":"The best coffee I have had... get the regular with one pump. Also had the poached egg, avocado, and chile oil breakfast sandwich, which was also delicious! Coming back next year for my daily coffee!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and the best coffee in Scottsdale! Everything made fresh in front of your eyes. This will be a yearly stop for spring training!"}
{"text":"Jane, the owner, is the sweetest! She takes the time to make sure each crepe is perfect while being one of the friendliest people I've ever met. I bring a friend and share one savory & one sweet. This place is a gem!"}
