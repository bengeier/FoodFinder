{"text":"Not a lot of breakfast options on York Campus outside the Second Cup and the What a Bagel. Came here for the breakfast sandwich. If you want veggies on it , its more money... Kinda meh. Should probably have stuck to the Cinnamon buns."}
{"text":"Anyone who goes to York University knows that going anywhere outside of campus for food can me a \"mission\" to say the least. So with limited options comes limited food quality from my culinary experiences at York University. I visited Treats as I was feeling like having a nice drink but didn't feel like paying Starbucks or Second Cup prices (I still did anyways). I ordered the Chai Latte thinking it would be of decent quality. While the drink was acceptable, it was nowhere near the the quality one would expect after paying $4 for a drink. The reason for the three stars is based on the service I received and nothing more. If you're on campus and want a special hot drink, I would say go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The price is pretty moderate considering it is campus food. You have the option to customize your food however you want. Many options for vegetarian and vegan style food. You could say this would be another attempt for healthier food choices. It's good they provide the calories and all ingredients in every item. They also have a coffee section as well as a bubble tea section. 

I ordered the steak signature bowl. If you don't want rice, you can sub it for a leafy veggie. The beef was marinated okay and texture wasn't too bad. Just stay away from the BBQ sauce cuz it's pretty strong. Doesn't really taste like BBQ sauce..."}
