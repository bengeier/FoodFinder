{"text":"What a joke! An example of total chaos and disorganization.  It started right from the opening, with patrons being totally confused on the procedures for registering and entering contests.

The casino seems to be much smaller than other casinos in the Calgary area. By 1:00 PM the casino was over crowded with no vacant machines.

Once the racing opens the parking lot is way too small.

We had the misfortune to go to the restaurant, which was well appointed and looking out upon the race track. Although at this time, 11:15 AM, the restaurant was not busy, it took 20 minutes to place our order.
We left after 2 hours and had not yet received our meals. Promises that our meals were on the way kept us waiting. Because our orders never arrived it is impossible to comment on the foods presentation and quality. 

This is easily the worst casino my friends and I have visited. My friends and I agree: \"We won't be back\"!

I wish them luck! They are going to need it."}
{"text":"We went to see the new attraction and couldn't believe how unorganized the whole place was. The set up for getting to the bar or waiting to be seated for the restaurant was not planned out well. We waited for what seemed like for ever in line for dinner and didn't even get acknowledge by any staff. Finally when the hostess appeared she wasn't pleasant to the customers at all and notified us it would be at least 45 minutes for our dinner order to be cooked. At this point we left! 

We will never be back to the casino"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a seat, to find out half the tables were empty. Ordered a coffee,  and was served a dirty cup, no cutlery to stir my coffee. Had to take some off another table. Had the century burger, nothing special or filling, but I guess what do you get for $11 these days.

End result is not to bother wasting your time and money eating at the casino. I hope they get better organised someday."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for their 30 cent wings on Monday. Our server was nothing but friendly, and our drinks and food came out quickly. Beer selection was pretty boring, but the long Island iced tea I had was decent and surprisingly big. I had one order of teriyaki wings followed by an order of hot. Can't say I have any complaints at all about the wings. The wings were meaty, the teriyaki sauce flavourful, and the hot wings pleasantly spicy (which was nice after having a few disappointing hot wings experiences recently). 

Standard wing night fare, but it was all thoroughly enjoyable. Wouldn't mind coming out when some races are on, as the booths offer a great view of the track.

UPDATE: Since I wrote this review, they have updated their beer selection. I'm particularly happy to see both Village and Last Best breweries on their menu."}
{"text":"Good for food and the race track 

Casino is a joke. No table games with a dealer at all. Only machines. Waste of time"}
{"text":"Hey we had a great time betting on the horses. The staff was really helpful and the BBQ burgers were pretty good. We were told by the lady taking bets about a school they have an hour before race time. It's a great way to spend an afternoon. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really really good nachos! One of the better ones my husband and I have had. Lots of toppings and no shortage of cheese. Spicy beef is a must have add-on."}
{"text":"I've been to Century Downs about 6 times now, and it's time I reviewed it. Century Downs is a small casino located near Cross Iron Mills, just north of Calgary. The casino itself offers a range of slot machines and digital blackjack and roulette, as well as local and remote race betting, featuring its own track for harness racing (with more types of racing coming in the future). 

Parking is decent, and since its off-reserve, it's one of the non-smoking casinos in the area. This place is also rarely crowded because of its somewhat remote location. 

The lounge area features a number of big TVs, and most major sporting events get screen time for those that like to sip on a beverage while they take a break from the slots.

The restaurant at the Casino is pretty tasty, as well. With regular specials with things like wing night, it's a nice alternative to some of the busy pubs around. The waitresses are all very friendly, if somewhat inexperienced, and very willing to make your visit pleasant. The drink selection has also improved considerably in recent months, now featuring a number of local brews in addition to the big brands. The only downside to the menu is that the prices are a bit high compared to some casinos, and you will need a player's club card to take advantage of the specials. That being said, the club does offer addition coupons and freebies, so it's not a bad deal since a free membership anyway. 

Even if you're not a gambler, this is worth a trip to grab a bite and see the race track during the warm months."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Nice and clean.
Staff are nice.
Casino machines are awful......dismal payouts. Rare to get a bonus, and hardly pay at all.
Also, some of the machines are way to loud, while others are hardly audible.
Will not return."}
{"text":"Cheap ass machines no payouts. Food is trash fish and chips some greasy undercooked fish soggy fries. Better casinos to go to in Calgary spend your money not here."}
{"text":"Ate today at the Grill here at Century Downs.  We were seated quickly and got our drinks soon after.  My hubbys reuben sandwich came out hot and good.  My cobb salad left a lot to be desired.  It was a large bowl of lettuce with along the sides: hardboiled egg, 3 slices of avocado, 4 slices of tomato and same of cucumber.  Now it didnt look appetizing at all, more like a cheap house salad (altho i have had better house salads than this).  Then i realize its missing the crumbled blue cheese.   It was brought out separate after i pointed it out.  But then after i finished it, was still bugging me that something else was missing. Pulled up the menu online and yep they also forgot the maple glazed walnuts and dried fruit.  Wow you actually forgot to put 3 items on my salad!!  Horrible quality control.  That was a $13 house salad.  Doubt will ever be back."}
{"text":"My mother brought us here (I say here because I am still here writing my review) for a Fathers Day \"brunch\" buffet with my 91 year old grandfather.

Brunch, they kept calling it. Brunch they said. $20 a head - cash only. 

We arrive. It's not brunch. It's less than 10 dishes none of which are - OK I'm going to pause this for a second to tell you that as a person with eating things (gluten free, vegetarian) I DO NOT IN ANY WAY expect a gluten free vegetarian buffet. 

I do, however expect to see some items that are fitting with \"brunch\" at a brunch this was NOT the case. It was like a luncheon for a board meeting, two meats, green beans a soggy veggie tray and some desserts.

I thought, OK I'll have some salad and a cup of coffee and accept that my eating needs aren't typical BUT WE HAD TO PAY $2.50 for a cup of terrible drip coffee.

AT A BUFFET THAT WAS $20/person. No water was offered to us. Just a cash bar with an unhappy bartender and expensive beer. $7 for a grasshopper for my Papa.

So, I went down stairs to the grill where they have \"All day breakfast\" according to their menu - which is not true! That's their OLD menu. 

I just wanted some god damn eggs.

And then out of the heavens arrived Pam who is currently hooking me up with two scrambled eggs that she convinced the cook to make. Pam is a real champ. She's a good manager and I truly felt for her and everyone working at this godforsaken place. 

As I'm writing this I know that I sound like an insanely entitled yuppie, who is sad for missing her eggs Benedict, but really what I am is a customer who is pissed at false advertising and LITERAL HIGHWAY ROBBERY (it's at Cross Iron Mills) 20/head for a brunch that ain't a brunch, with no coffee, no too sweet orange juice, no tap water in a plastic cup. Just warm bottles of pop and cans of beer. 

Don't advertise something you're not doing. Don't take advantage of people looking to celebrate Father's Day with a brunch. 

I have included the photo of the brunch I paid $20 for. Mmmmm. 

OH MY GOD IM ADDING MORE:

My mother went on to order nachos one hour ago. I am still waiting to pick them up from the bar to carry upstairs (because you know, that's normal) and I have been standing here since. The last I heard on the case of the missing nachos is they \"aren't up, maybe they didn't get punched in\" ...

This place is majorly understaffed I get it. It's busy, but holy cow. One hour for some pub nachos!? If you can't handle a rush don't call yourself a \"grill\" just have a vending machine with chips."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Century Downs was good.  Took a few minutes to be acknowledged to be seated, but once we were, service was good.  Our waitress was Claudia and she was attentive as she could be as she was the only one working the restaurant.  Food was good and arrived quickly.  Any new establishment needs time to work out the bugs, so for people to be as critical as they are is unfair."}
{"text":"Love this casino! Always full, good beer selection, and sometimes there are horse races happening outside. Oh, and they have Corgi Cash VLT's which is my fave."}
