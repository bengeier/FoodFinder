{"text":"Pad Thai is amazing. Top #1 spot for pad thai along with Sukhothai. U must try it at Martino's located at 178 Dupont St."}
{"text":"Small unassuming place, you don't come here for the sit-down atmosphere and that's fine.  Based on other Yelp! reviews I was hoping for a hole-in-the-wall novelty gem...  Perhaps I just don't do enough drugs to kill my palette, or maybe I should've been drunk.  Niche market?
The prices for a slice aren't bad, ranging from $3 to $5 - unless you want to get it to go, then it's an extra $1.25 for a takeaway paper bag.  Very unimpressed.
Pretty standard options, at least they're generously portioned (one slice is really more like two).  Got the Spring mix: thin crust, which is nice... crazy-high in sodium.  I mean, you don't eat pizza to be healthy, but this was a LOT of salt.
Also tried the Coconut Rose Shrimp ($11).  In a word: grease.  Just oily and unimpressive.  I wasn't poisoned - which is great! - but it seemed like the failed first time execution of what might've been a good idea in competent hands.
At least the staff was friendly.  Okay, one was, the other two were kinda impartial.  That's not a strike against them, since again, though there is stools it's not really a sit-down place.

Bottom line: if you don't care what you're putting in your mouth-hole beyond, \"is it edible?\" then this is a acceptable joint to satisfy your need to physically consume *something*.  If that doesn't describe you though, you'd be better moving on.

C'est la vie, live and learn."}
{"text":"Martino's Pizza offers a tasty variety of pizza slices, but don't underestimate their Asian dish selection! Even their spaghetti and meatballs leave something to remember.

They offer a decently priced lunch specials and are able to cook the meals fresh in a matter of minutes. I highly recommend trying their Pad Thai and Lemongrass chicken dishes.

For dinner they offer the same dishes at a higher price (after 3pm), but to compensate they add extra ingredients to your meal such as peppers and other veggies."}
{"text":"I tried their fried rice and other chinese rice dishes.

Not bad, quite an amount of salt and oil in the fried rice though.
typical chinese food in canada I guess"}
{"text":"Excellent chinese food...I know, sounds weird because it's a pizza joint.

I discovered this Italian-Chinese place when one of my colleagues came back with some Chinese take out. I couldn't believe he was referring to the pizza place across the street.

This has become my lunch go-to. Best dishes so far? The Glass noodles or Thai Basil Chicken. Their pad thai is OK. They offer spicy versions of their dishes, but beware it can have a kick! Great lunch special (between 11-3) : all Asian dishes are $7.50 including tax."}
{"text":"Lady that works there is a snob gives me attitude every time I go in.  For that main reason I give them 0 stars but 1 star is the least I can pick.  She needs to shape up big time!

Pad Thai many years ago used to be decent , now its just gross and cheaply made. The price is expensive for what u get. Very dry, no flavor and mostly noodles; where is the rest of ingredients in pad Thai?! 

Pizza isn't bad but most pizza in Toronto isn't that great. Advice: I'd go to Shoppers down the street and buy a frozen pizza and cook it yourself. Better and better deal.

They have a coconut soup - GROSS! Don't waste your money. 

The beef vermicelli noodle salad is not good either; how can u mess that up!

I've tried enough dishes there to give them a chance and now I've decided I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We found this place using yelp. The lady was really friendly. The pizza was delicious. We had the general tsao Pizza."}
{"text":"I love Martino's. We order from Martino's frequently. The pizza is great if you're looking for a late-night snack, but the Chinese food is delicious and really cheap. Our favourite is the Shanghai noodles with beef, though the green curry vegetables are a close second. Plus, the people are so nice."}
{"text":"Wow. I was surprised with this place. Great pizza and to have delicious Chinese food as well, awesome. I got delivery and the delivery driver was pleasant and friendly. For the Pizza I bought the Martinos Tropical. Basically a Hawaiian but with Pepperoni inside of Ham. For the Chinese food I bought Singapore Noodles. Not as spicy as other places but delicious none the less. I commend this place for doing teo things great. Great way to have a dinner or late night snack and don't feel like cooking yourself."}
{"text":"I love Martino's so much. I've eaten here at least half a dozen times now in the past two months. We love the pad Thai, and the spicy noodles and sweet and sour chicken are excellent as well.  Our favourite pizza is the General Tao, but we also really love the $20 Asian Dish + 3 topping small pizza combo. The prosciutto is excellent. I don't know what they do to make pizza but their cheese consistently tastes amazing. Crust isn't really a thing here - unlike Za - but I've never been a crust fanatic so I'm quite happy with a small amount of crumbly crust. Dipping sauce is $0.80 and not half bad either.

Sidenote: I once won $20 at a comedy show playing a game where a stipulation was that we had to tell the audience what we'd spend it on if we won. I said Martino's, and took it here to buy more General Tao pizza. That's how good it is."}
{"text":"This place is loveable and a little weird with its eclectic menu. I have heard of others getting a slice of Kung Pao pizza, and they say it's delicious but I will take their word for it. 

I've had some amazing slices here and some not-so-amazing slices, depending on the freshness of how long the pizzas have been sitting for. But a fresh slice is one to remember. I personally like to go with the classics. 

It's a tiny little place with bright lights, so I would recommend taking your slice for a stroll in the beautiful Annex area. Relax and enjoy that pizza slice!"}
{"text":"Have seen this place for years but somehow never managed to go in as at St. George and Dupont, it is a little off the beaten track of my neighbourhood.  As a pizza lover I am always intrigued by the stand alone places not too far from where I live.  I went in today before 11:30 am and had the honour of being the first slice of the day as the owners were a little late to open.  It appears that this is a family run business.  As of this review a fairly large triangle of pepperoni atop a reasonable amount of mozzarella and tomato sauce on thin-ish, fresh, but very white crust (as opposed to the distinctive durum semolina cornmeal rolled crust found at Classico north of Eglinton), will set you back $4.00 including tax.  Given the Annex location and the average price of slices these days (for reference Pizzaiola is now $4.25 before tax for the same type of slice), it's not a bad deal.  A Deluxe, Margarita, or Veggie slice is $4.75 including tax.  My rating hovers at the 4 star mark, but I get the sense that the owners want to please their customers and take a certain amount of pride in their business, which factors into my rating.  I have not tried the Asian food or any of the more creative pizza combinations but if you are in the area and are craving pizza it's a tasty enough choice, though if your appetite is big like mine, you'll want more than one slice.  Salt level is noticeable but not off the charts."}
{"text":"Went on the hunt for stone oven pizza and found a Asian fusion pizzeria! 
Tiny little spot with a couple of seats.. it's more a place for food to go, and looks like it was run but a friendly Asian family! Wasn't quite the stone oven but.. 
The food took about 15-20 mins to prepare from scratch which is what I would expect from authentic pizza.. and food was piping hot and delicious. 
Fianc√© didn't enjoy the general tao's pizza.. said it tasted weird to have it on top of the pizza.. and gave his away and ate mine with me .. I got the naple margarita which is basil, oregano and garlic.! I'm a huge garlic lover. But even that, was too garlicky for me.. still really enjoyed it though and ate the lot. A small is enough for 2 unless you're feeding a party bus! 
The reason for the 4* was the cleanliness on the floors, you'll see from the pics. Even the table wasn't cleaned down, and on times when it wasn't busy they could have swept a little to clear up but didn't. What bothered me most was the floor was unclean in the back too.. there's room for improvement but it was a delicious place for pizza.. and the staff were lovely and friendly so I won't hold it against them! It's a pretty busy spot for business so they're doing something right!"}
{"text":"Been working in the area for a few years and Martino's has been one of my go-to spot for good, inexpensive food. I was surprised when I saw pizza, pasta, wings and asian dishes on the same menu... Weird... but the food is consistently good!

I've tried a variety off of their menu:
- individual pizza slices are very big with crispy thin crust
- pastas, their alla vodka is pretty good!
- wings, crispy with the sauce on the side. They recently increased their prices, but still fair
- asian dishes, chili lemongrass chicken (nice and spicey, but you can change the spice level if you tell them), pepper beef (Yumm! I love anything loaded with black pepper), pad thai (ok, but I go to Bua Thai nearby for the best one) 

The space is small with about 6 seats and not much going on with the decor, mainly a take-away place. Service is fast and friendly - I usually call ahead for my order (other than pizza) and it's ready in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Generous portioned delicious pizza, my go to place for pizza in the Annex.  Much better than any of the other larger chains in Toronto.  Try the pepperoni / pineapple that they always have ready, Rebecca and I always grab a slice each once a week."}
{"text":"Great pizza place and good Asian food. Super friendly staff and cool Little spot to grab a slice. I recommend the general Taos pizza."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pizza and pasta. The place doesn't look like much from outside, and the eclectic menu was a turn-off for me, but I tried it once on a recommendation and have been back a few times since. You can build your own pizza and combine it with a pasta or Asian dish at a reasonable price. A medium pizza and a dish comes out to $25 including tax and can probably feed three people. I've enjoyed all the pizzas I've had there (they're very cheesy and the crust is a good meidum thickness) and the pastas are pretty good too. I haven't tried the Asian dishes but have heard they don't have a lot of flavour.

I usually call ahead to pick up and the order takes about 20 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"This is a fast food Chinese restaurant with a pizza oven. I tried the pizza here once purely for convenience and hunger, and I was pleasantly surprised! The pizza was excellent. Thin, crunchy crust loaded with pepperoni. They're a little stingy on the cheese, but overall it's pretty great. I come back here on a weekly basis and would choose it hands down over the big chains."}
{"text":"The slices are decent but what really takes the cake here are the pizzas that they make fresh/custom-made. Those are pretty damn good.....

Only once or twice, the eggplant on my pizza has been undercooked so that's really their only flaw.

The pad thai is pretty good too. It tastes fresh and isn't pumpkin orange/sickeningly sweet (like Thai Basil...). They don't have any satay sauce so I can't get any on the side but all in all, good pad thai.

Scrumptious pizza though....  and the fact that they have uncommon topping options such as Gorgonzola cheese, eggplant, etc. motivates me to keep coming."}
{"text":"Delivery disappointment. I'm always looking for new options of delivery and I came across this place as \"Martino`s Asian Fusion Kitchen\". At first I thought it was weird to do italian and asian cuisines in the same place but curiosity got the best of me.

General Tao Chicken was a nasty red sauce with a ridiculously high viscosity served on a lot of white rice, and no vegetables at all (which isnt uncommon, but this plate just looked very underwhelming and the taste matched it). Singapore Curry Noodles were bland, lacking spice and any interesting flavours, and a little gritty from the curry powder still.

Looks like the pizza or italian foods may have been the way to go on this one."}
{"text":"Their pizza is garbage. I'm very sensitive to artificial preservatives in food. The one slice i ate sat in my stomach like a rock.
On top of that the woman who appears to run the place is classless and rude."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Chose some pizza slices, a spring roll, medium spicy wings, and a chicken pad thai.

The chicken pad thai was so awful! I wish I could get my money back. It just falls flat, and was absolutely tasteless. I took one bite and couldn't eat it. I threw it away. It was a total waste of money.

The spring roll was mushy.

The Pizza was actually decent, the Margherita stands out, and it tastes the best.

Wings were fine, as expected.

I would not order from here again."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of the negative reviews. Their pizzas by the slice are among the best in Toronto. They have a pesto slice which was outstanding. We have ordered 2 pasta dishes and 1 noodle dish as takeout. The pastas were well made - one had rose sauce and the other marinara. The noodles had a coconut rose sauce and were outstanding. The service is always friendly. Not a sit down place but great for a slice of pizza and takeout pasta."}
{"text":"I do love this little joint.    They have a really yummy Margherita pizza,  but beware  it is covered in garlic,  I think garlic butter :).  So bring your breath mints!

They also have some Asian food like a basil beef and noodle dish I believe.   Their Asian food isn't bad either,  for fast food,  better than one would expect from a place that makes pizza and Asian food...strange at first blush indeed...."}
{"text":"Called in a delivery order. Service was nice, pizza was SUPER FAST and delivery driver was excellent- very nice, polite, friendly. Tried the classic margharita pizza. Toppings and cheese were good but the crust to me wasn't that great. Wouldn't order pizza from here again. I prefer chain pizza over this and I'm hoping to find a non-chain pizza joint to order from regularly with really delish pizza."}
{"text":"I always order delivery. Just ordered it, in fact. I usually get the Classic Margherita, but the pic here of the Bacon Club looks fantastic, so I'm going to give it a shot. Shall post back with a review of it later. 

They're always busy, but friendly on the phone, and the driver has always been cool as well. I haven't tried any of the Asian stuff as their pizza is a solid choice (and whenever I want pizza I call them). The Margherita is subtle but delicious. Always hot but never burned. 

I've walked by the place a few times and it doesn't look like there's really any place to eat there except for standing by the window, so delivery is the best choice. 

Not much more to say, really...no issues - just good food."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Fast delivery. Consistent quality. Fun to be able to order other indulgences from the same place."}
{"text":"Still order pizza from here and still consistently great.  Never tried the Chinese so can't comment.  Every time I have guests over and we order pizza, I always get it from here, never disagreement top notch!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised!

I was having a crappy day after dealing with my stupid bank and being disappointed after thinking they were going to be reasonable.

So I'm walking home on a FREEZING evening, and after dropping into 3 stores along the way and finding NOTHING of interest at a decent price - I stopped into Martino's - almost out of boredom - and am I glad I did.

I must say - when I saw their menu of pizza and Asian I was not a believer.

But wow.  Big portions at a reasonable price - and although I'm almost always disappointed when I ask at most restaurants for the food to be prepared 'spicy' - the food was ACTUALLY spicy - and I didn't even stress HOW MUCH I like extra spicy.

I ordered 3 items off the Asian part of the menu - and ALL THREE were good.  (That is WAY BETTER odds than I expect when I pick things at random from an average place.)

One of the pieces of shrimp in the garlic shrimp was very soft and either overcooked or old - but the rest was good - and the Beef with saut√©ed mushrooms was a really pleasant surprise - spicy as can be - and I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

I'm looking forward to checking out more of their menu soon.  Pity they don't deliver before 4 pm."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this place makes the best pizza in the city. Looks a bit dingy on the outside, but their pizza is amazing! Perfect amount of crust and crispiness. Their other stuff is not bad either. Tried out their honey garlic wings the other night and was not disappointed. My fiance and I always grab a slice of the Margherita when we don't want to cook."}
