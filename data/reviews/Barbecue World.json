{"text":"Service: Trouble free.  We got a quote for it and so we called ahead to tell them we were coming back to purchase it.  They had everything ready.  I went in, paid, drove to the back and picked up within 20 minutes.  From the guy that answered the phone to the guy who loaded up the bbq, they were all courteous and helpful.

Shop:  They have a huuuuuge selection and their warehouse is huuuuuge.  If you need it, they probably have it.

Review: We spent a pretty penny on the stainless steel bbq so hopefully I won't need another one any time soon (although, I want to get another charcoal one).  If I need to buy another one though, this is definitely the place to go.  I will be suggesting bbqs.com to other people too.

Reason for stars: It was pain-less to deal with them.  It was a very pleasant experience.  They knew their stuff and their prices were very competitive.  No need to haggle with them, just take it and go."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the showroom when I came shopping here one day with my dad.

By far the most selection of BBQ stuff I have ever seen. 

If you wanted to BBQ anything and in any environment they have a contraption to do it here. Saw electric, gas, coal types. 

Take a look at the pics I took it's like a BBQ museum in here. :)"}
{"text":"Names have changed but it is still the biggest BBQ Showroom in North America. I have been going here for years now and believe it or not this is a place I bring family and friends to when visiting the GTA. I think this is a must see when touring the city. I can always count on these guys to have the accessories and parts that I need. They also carry a  wide selection of charcoal and woods for your smokers. Check it out."}
