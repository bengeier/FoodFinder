{"text":"The pie is so so. Too much crust for me, but sauce is good. I got all the meats and they are tasty. Garlic knots are on point. Customer service is excellent.  Mario served me and he's awesome! For a \"mall\" pizza ok."}
{"text":"No where near the best pizza in Vegas but it is superior than all the major pizza chains."}
{"text":"Chicken calzone was tasty. But I think it was Aaliyah, who made our experience a great one. She is a natural in serving the customer. She was genuinely sweet and you could tell she enjoyed what she was doing, which is a gem these days. I was left with a very good impression an am already thinking about going back... Thanks AALIYAH! :))"}
{"text":"I remember my first visit to the Palms food court and Famous Famiglia Pizzeria was the only thing that looked appetizing.  I decided to try a slice of Mushroom & Spinach and a Spinach & Cheese stromboli.  I couldn't resist getting only one item, everything looked delicious.

The pizza slice was tasty, the crust was crispy, and all the ingredients tasted fresh.  The cheese was nicely melted and went great with their marinara sauce.  The pizza was great and the stromboli looked even better.  The stromboli was stuffed with spinach and cheese and was paired with a side of marinara.  The stromboli was piping hot and the cheese was gooey and tasted delicious with the spinach.  The dough was crispy, thick, and the texture was just right.  The combination of all the ingredients paired with the marinara dipping sauce made for one of the best stromboli's I've ever tried.

I highly suggest trying out this pizzeria if your visiting the Palms.  Every time I'm in Vegas, I make sure to stop by and get one of their stromboli's.  The food is a little greasy, but indulge, nevertheless."}
{"text":"I. Had lunch at this establishment in the food court at The Palms. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and sausage pizza. This had to be the best slice of pizza I have eaten in a very long time. The establishment is clean. The employees are friendly and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Not the same as Famiglia in NYC AND double price. Tasted like some typical hotel-cantina dog-food-flavored Sbarro."}
{"text":"Generous toppings, garlicky garlic rolls, good crust...but I've had better."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Came here for an early dinner before hitting the strip. Will come here when I stay in Las Vegas again!"}
{"text":"I came out of Star Wars at the Palms jonesing for pizza. I had wanted pizza on Saturday but a famous pizza place near me recorded my credit card wrong on the phone (of course then it would not go through argh) so I was already in distress.
We ran over to the food court which is about 23 feet from the theatres. I got the pepper and cheese which was the bomb of all pizza spices- after all I love a good thin crust- my husband got a pepperoni and he agreed it was great- and the garlic knots-5 scrumptious garlic soaked little devils. Could not finish them all so they made a great lunch today!!
Oh I am so thrilled we have them 1.4 miles away.
Pizza is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent value for your money !
Garlic knots are a must but messy so ask for extra napkins. Pizza and calzone are good!
Although English may not be the staffs first language you do get what you need with minimal issues and a happy attitude."}
{"text":"Located inside the Wild Horse Pass Casino, this Pizza joint is A-OK.  We stopped in here for a quick lunch after a few hours on property.....I had a Cheese Pizza and The Better Half (TBH) had a Calzone.  A friend who joined us for lunch had a Spinach Stuffed Pizza, which he shared with us.

The Cheese Pizza was ok.  Not the best Pizza I've had, but good.  The Spinach Stuffed Pizza was pretty good as well.  TBH enjoyed her Calzone.  Overall, it wasn't bad for a food court place.  I actually enjoy the food court at this property.....it has Fatburger, a Deli featuring Boar's Head Deli Meats, and a Mexican joint.

{"text":"We wanted a quick meal in our room before heading out on the town, so we grabbed a pie and some garlic knots from Famiglia.  The staff was very friendly, and the food was awesome!

It was nice to see that (being in a casino) the food was very reasonably priced.  The Large Pizza and double order of garlic knots was right around $20.  

The pizza had a crunchy crust, which I like and tasted great!  The garlic knots were delicious and loaded with garlic, which as an added bonus will deter vampires for the remainder of your vacation."}
{"text":"While staying at a nearby motel, my family and I decided to grab some pizza here since we were in the Palms food court already. The pepperoni and sausage pizza was pretty good, but it was definitely overpriced. In terms of quick service food, I'd rather get Panda Express here or head over to Tropicana Ave for In-N-Out."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE PIE!!!!!

Seriously, this is the exact type of pizza I've been looking for!  The crust is perfect, the slices are large and thin, and the sauce is actually really good! A large cheese pie is 14.99! Not too bad considering it's in a casino, a plus for me is that I get dinning credits from the Palms so my pie was only 5.36! Woot!

I also tried the garlic knots which were 5 for 1.99, I didn't pay attention to see what they looked like at first, but once I got home and opened them theyre basically small bread knots... small though. Lol. not your typical knot! They were aight.

The pizza is def my fave so far, I been on the search for a pie like this and finally found one that wasn't 20+ dollars!

I will for sure be back, and will not even mind paying the full price! Also, the customer service here is awesome! The guys are both super nice and helpful!

Yay!"}
{"text":"I usually order the garlic knots here ...can't eat here without them. I was hesitant to order a meatball sandwich because I thought it might taste generic. I was so wrong ...it actually tasted better then most. The reason I liked it so much was because they toasted the whole sandwich. It wasn't like most places where the meatballs are hot and the bread is cold . It was really good! This may be my go to menu item from now on!"}
{"text":"Your basic greasy tomato-y Italian fast food place. They give a hearty portion of garlic knots in either small or large size. The knots themselves tasted OK, but nothing too special. The knots on the bottom of the container they were served in were swimming with butter and oil, which made it unappealing to eat the last few remaining pieces. Pizza by the slice was a decent size, wasn't too remarkable in taste, but hey you're at a food court, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"I grew up and often survived on NY style pizza.  I spent about 4 years away from the NYC region and found myself spending a few months in Las Vegas.  During the first week or so there I was in The Palms putzing around in the casino.  Was hungry and just checked out the food court.  Thought I would give this place a shot.  I enjoyed the taste very much.  I don't know if it tasted better since I was deprived of NY pizza for several years or what.  I worked near The Palms during that time and for the rest of my stay in Vegas I probably hit this place once a week for lunch."}
{"text":"This is some really good fast food pizza! The garlic knots are amazing, they are coated with garlicky butter. I also tried the pepperoni and cheese stromboli which was simple yet tasty. This is a great place to grab a quick bite when you're at The Palms casino."}
{"text":"What do you expect for pizza by the slice at a casino $5 for a slice of pizza very few mushrooms very few pepperoni on it just average Pizza it's more like I've had a few beers I want a slice of pie you asked for ranch dressing they want to charge you a dollar for a 2 ounce cup of ranch I mean seriously $5 and change for a slice of pizza and now you want to charge me for ranch I don't know but hey it hit the spot when I needed to but as far as quality flavor not so much"}
{"text":"Was so good I had to come back for more later the same night. I could've gone back a third or fourth time. I would suggest getting at least 2 slices at once.

The price isn't great, but what do you expect at The Palms?

The staff was nice."}
{"text":"The pizza was great the flavors and the cheese just melted, the sauce was awesome. The service was great , the slices are pretty big for for $4 a slice."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but the pizza isn't good like it use to be. This last time we had to bring back an entire pie that had been a carry out.

My son didn't see the pizza before taking it home. Once home we opened it to see a bright red cheese pizza! Someone had soaked the entire pie with some sort of red disgusting liquid. The pie was mushy & had grease & red stuff all over it.

We called & tried explaining what we were given for $18.00 bucks. We were told they don't normally do this but come back in tomorrow & will give you another 1. They then hung up on my son. He calls back & wants to know who he just spoke to, they said Mike the GM. So Mikes told that we will be in at 2 tomorrow. I called Mike at 12:45 & said I'm the guys mom who spoke to you last night about the pizza,would it be ok if I come around 3:30; my sons at work so I'll be in & Im bringing the old pizza with me.
I get to the Palms food court with pizza pie in hand. Then from there everything become more weird then the pizza itself. I ask for Mike! The girl in front hands me my redone pie. Mike comes out from the back & I tell him who I am, then hand him my original pizza pie. Told him he should check into how this pie got red & made my son sick. Mike proceeds to tell me that he never spoke to my son last night. Mike also says he doesn't know what I'm talking about. He though I had just ordered a carry out that was already paid for. So I then asked him so you have another employee that is impersonating you?
Needless to say, Mike stuck to his crazy story that he wasn't there last night, he didn't talk to my son last night, & that they had a new cook last night!
This entire Red Pizza Pie That Got is sick is a mystery & Mike is claiming he's innocent of anything & everything!
The truth & nothing but the truth is definitely lacking at FAMIGLIA PIZZERIA"}
{"text":"While I was getting my tuna melt over at Earl of Sandwich, my boyfriend popped over here to pick up some grub.

He decided on the pepperoni stromboli and garlic knots. The food was ok also was a small portion and over priced of course considering is located in a casino food court. Even MC Donald's is 20% higher than the stand alone stores.

I tried a garlic knot and was not impressed, I much prefer those of villa pizza in which they are more of a true garlic knot.

My boyfriend was hungry not too long after so not a good vote from me on the food portion for the price ratio!

It was just ok however we will not be returning any time soon if at all. We can get so much more flavor and bang to the buck elsewhere."}
{"text":"The location is pretty good. It is located in the Palms food court. The pizza was heated up pretty quick. I ordered 2 slices and they were done pretty quick. I am not really sure how long the pizza was sitting there, but it was out of the oven pretty quick. The pizza was pretty good, but I don't know if it is $5 a slice good."}
{"text":"We used to have Famiglia at one of our food courts on Oahu so I was stoked to see that they had a counter in the food court area of Wild Horse Pass Hotel & Casino. I only wanted one thing: garlic knots. I've never cared for their pizza but the garlic knots are the reason I used to dine there. Anyway, I was excited to be able to have some of their garlic knots again but I was sorry once I stood in line at the casino. 

It must have been training day or something that night because I swear, no one knew what the heck was going on. I mean no one-not even the manager. I was in a line, about 5 deep and all of the employees behind the counter were standing around, not knowing what to say, not knowing what to do...it was like a comedy of errors. The customer standing in line ahead of me asked if they had a certain type of pizza and just like a game of telephone, the employees asked each other if they had that pizza. Another employee walked out of the kitchen and just stood there, staring at the line of customers. The manager on duty seemed to be having trouble with the register but when it was my turn to pay (after about 10 minutes of waiting in line for pizza that was already made), she didn't apologize for the wait or even acknowledge that her team was having issues with getting their job done that night. 

Turns out, I could've lived without the garlic knots. They definitely weren't worth going through the training zone for. I sat in the food court and didn't enjoy my cardboard-like pizza but I did savor the garlic knots because God knows I would not put myself through that pain again and give my business to that particular Famous Famiglia Pizzeria again."}
