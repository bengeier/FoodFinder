{"text":"Not sure why my review was misplaced in a different restaurant. So I am reposting here.
I finally found my favorite place for Hu Tieu Nam Vang (Phnom Penh Rice Noodle Soup).
The restaurant recently opened so I wanted to give it a try.
First I order Com Ga Hai Nam (Hainan Chicken Rice), which is the name of this place, because I thought it must be so special that they make it the name of the business. I was not impressed.
Being not satisfied yet, I ordered Hu Tieu Nam Vang and wow...This is the best Hu Tieu I have in the US (I have tried all the Vietnamese restaurants in the Arizona, some in Florida, Georgia, and Illinois, but this is the best). One of the things that make It truly authentic is you can find tep mo (fried pork fat) in the bowl, making it smell and taste amazing. I finished it and ordered one more. I even came back the next day."}
{"text":"I love the fresh sugar cane juice here. It's a bit pricey 4.50 but worth every sip. It is very hard to find places in Arizona who serves sugar cane juice."}
{"text":"Finally, a great decent local Viet food joint is here. As far as I know, this location has changed so many of its ownership and business names; but so far Com Ga Hai Nam is totally worth to try out. 

The staff is very friendly, which you find it hard to get accommodated nowadays with Viet food course concepts. About the food, I could not even find any negativity. They surely know what they are doing, and their specialties have amazed me until this moment. I have tried Chicken Vermicelli noodles, Hu Tieu Nam Vang (Phnome Penh noodles) , Chao Long (pork intestine porridge) , and I know I will be coming back for more. 

The price is decent (around $6-$8 for a bowl of soup) and there is almost no long wait time. I'm so glad they opened this business."}
{"text":"The wings are halved nibblets of wings but damn they are tasty. Nam Vang soup was a good fishy and porky broth with a decent assortment of tasty things mixed in. The Veg plate had what looked like chrysanthemum leaves which were an excellent balance to the salt and funk of the soup. Again I am a goofy white guy who loves Asian food way too much if I order fish sauce wings just assume I am ok with fish sauce and don't second guess me. Also it's a food court place with not in the way of AC so it is a bit hot on a 110+ day. I would recommend trying this place if you are looking for an authentic adventure while still being in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Simple relish food...the guy at the counter is nice but he doesn't really speak English well so just give him the number you want to order"}
{"text":"See what happens when I get lazy about writing reviews?  I miss landing the FTR (first to review)!  :( The photos attached were taken more than two weeks ago... Ah, well.

Mom said her shrimp pho was \"OK,\" but I was thoroughly enjoying my duck pho, until I noticed mushrooms swimming in the broth... I'm allergic to mushrooms!  Probably why the pho tasted so good (since mushrooms add the \"umami\" factor).  I was apprehensive in trying this bowl, since duck is greasy and its flavor can sometimes be overwhelming, but the broth tasted fabulous (chicken stock), was not too oily, and the slices of meat had great texture, similar to a thick brisket.  

Thai ced tea was lightly-sweetened.  Perhaps too lightly, and it seemed the glass had more ice than tea.

I may go back and try the duck pho again if I'm able to order it without the mushroom...  There were two selections that came with egg, instead of rice, noodles, but I think I could've ordered anything of the menu and sub egg noodles, if I wanted.

Went back today and inquired if I could order anything with egg noodles, but the man taking the orders only gave me four options, and I'm still unsure if egg noodles with other selections are not possible-- there was a language barrier, maybe?  I'm not going to ask anymore... I'll just try the vegetarian selection another time (two of the four had shrimp in it, and I'm allergic).  I did try the duck pho again, without mushrooms, and it was still tasty, though not as delicious as before, but no worries- I added hot chili oil.  Seemed like there were more duck in it today...

Mom decided to get a pho selection she liked from Hue Gourmet, #201 Bun Bo Hue.

Forgot my phone at home; otherwise, I'd have taken pictures!"}
{"text":"Tucked within the food court area of Mekong Plaza, Com Ga Hai Nam offers various noodle soups, rice plates, and rice noodle dishes for a reasonable price. Items are numbered for easy ordering with succinct descriptions to aid in your decision on what to get.

I ended up with #13, a vermicelli dish with grilled pork, shrimp, and vegetables. The dish overall had a good balance of flavors and textures. I enjoyed the bbq grilled taste of the pork. The shrimp, however, was overcooked and tough. The vegetables were fresh and crisp, and provided a nice contrast with the soft, slightly chewy rice vermicelli noodles.

Service was fast and friendly.

The meal itself was $6.50, an excellent price for the amount of food I got. Overall, a good experience!"}
{"text":"Mekong Plaza consists of an ethnic supermarket and a few dozen small stores, almost all Thai or Oriental themed.  Tucked within the mall is a food court with four offerings.  Com Ga Hai Nam was the busiest of these the day we stopped by, so we ordered a couple of Viet Nam-style lunches: vegetables over rice noodles, and fried chicken with fried rice.

As with a typical food court, there are tables shared by all of the food stands, and on the Sunday when we visited they were virtually all occupied, almost uniformly by people of Oriental descent.  The reason is probably that people not used to this style of cuisine are hesitant to try it.  But we felt adventurous enough to order dishes that were not too unusual by our standards.

I think the food was competently prepared, and most everyone else seemed to be enjoying their lunches, but alas it was a bit too different for me.  For example, the wide rice noodles were gummy by my standards, and the chicken was not well cleaned - too many veins and \"stuff\".  This is not to say you won't like the food, and it is a fun experience.

Note: For a food court, a 26-minute wait to get the ordered food seemed excessive but no one was complaining, so I guess that's the way it is."}
