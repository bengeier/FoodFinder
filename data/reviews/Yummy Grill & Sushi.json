{"text":"I was shocked. An unassuming, small sushi place with some of the better, fresh, inventive sushi I have tried."}
{"text":"I did my \"sushi restaurant research\" before we came here. I'm very happy with our choice of coming here and trying their food and service. My husband and I both got their lunch special combo boxes which came with yummy miso, yummy ginger lettuce salad, sushi rolls, shrimp/veggie tempura, calrose sticky rice, and salmon teriyaki (my choice)/ red snapper teriyaki (his choice). Mango mochi dairy-free ice cream for desert. Satisfied with food quality and service!! Ambience is casual. We will be returning! :)"}
{"text":"One young gal running the register, taking phone orders, serving people at the counter and waiting on tables. Not an ideal situation during lunch hour. Food was good... service painfully slow. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh fish (flown in from Tokyo, Japan),  fresh wasabi root and I've heard that the live Uni is a must. They were out of Uni, so I can't give a review for that. The space is tiny, I recommend making a reservation. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi now is offering a new sophisticated sister restaurant to it's already delectable sushi menu. We had a delicious Omakase that would have cost at least double on the strip. The 3 versions of lobster were mouth-watering. The kamashida toro and Hokkaido uni were amazing.  There were great sake options as well. The entire meal was well thought out and paced beautifully.  We enjoyed every second without feeling rushed in any way. This is a hidden Las Vegas gem.  Date nights here we come!"}
{"text":"My sisters boyfriend and I were craving sushi but she doesn't like it. We sat down after not being greeted or barely talked to and ordered quite a bit and the man approached us saying we had to order at least $15 a person even though she wasn't eating it and the menu said $15 minimum not per person. When I asked if she was just not allowed to be there he said \"yea pretty much.\" THAT IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT CUSTOMERS. So ridiculous. Even if the food is good the service sucks."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I've had in my life. I'm a fitness freak and literally every weekend on my cheat days I'm here! Service is beyond excellent! Tovas speacial is my favorite and I never get tired of it! Thanks for the best sushi and service in town!"}
{"text":"From a friends recommendation I wanted to try this \"gem\".......  Absolutely love sushi and been eating sushi for years...... I had ordered their special toro nigiri it came out looking very old and dark brown, ordered a hamachi belly and got the end of the fish which made the sushi verrrrry chewy and not enjoyable, also had a spicy salmon bowl and it was drenched in sauce with horrible pieces of fish....   What a disappointed.. Won't be going back.  Service was alright, but all non speaking English servers???!! What a irritating start to a horrible lunch."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first visit to this restaurant.  Very good sushi rolls, very good service. Always refilling our drinks. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Fish was super fresh . The sushi chiefs are authentic . Lots of Saki options"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars here. As of a few months ago, their sushi has become a joke. Extremelly small! The rolls have barely any fish in them, they don't even fill it up rice! They used to be good, but after several more tries, we are done."}
{"text":"Love this place, they are good about describing the different kinds of sushi if you wanna try something different.  any time we have company we go here for your sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's my go to for sushi. I can't wait to try the new service they have."}
{"text":"Thank you Chef Eric. Your food is always delicious and you are very caring about your business and your customers."}
{"text":"The staff was attentive. The food was good. But the sushi chef did not wear gloves nor wash his hands once. Handling raw fish then fresh vegetables then assembling the rolls. He even mixed a cucumber salad with his bare hands. Not once did I see him clean his hands. My wife wanted to leave. I wish we had.  The rolls were good but I won't go back knowing what I know now."}
{"text":"This place should be renamed YUCKY Grill and Sushi.  The fish is far from fresh. My sashimi bowl contained inedible, fishy slices that I spit out into my napkin.  I prayed I wouldn't get food poisoning that night.  My husband and I suspect that a oily mixture is placed on the sashimi in an attempt to disguise the fishy, old taste. It's easier to get away with unfresh fish when it's in a roll.  I gave it a star only for the stir fried noodles, which were actually good.  The grill foods may be safe but for fresh fish stay away."}
{"text":"We strictly wanted creative sushi rolls and decided to come here based on a selection of more than 50 specialty rolls. Ingredients seemed fresh, and service was good. I gave three stars because this sushi was what I would call \"Americanized\"... everything was loaded in sauce, and loaded with rice. The rolls were good sized but not a whole lot of real food substance. The seafood and vegetable elements were so thin and small compared to giant portions of cream cheese, mayo and sugary sauces. Flavor was good but nothing spectacular, decent presentation. Despite the amount of rolls, ingredients are very similar without a lot of selection. People who don't actually like sushi that much will love these rolls. I thought prices were high for the amount of seafood."}
{"text":"Fresh!!!! When you eat sushi or sashimi you want fresh fish, this is what you get in yummy sushi. This place is always busy because people know the foods is quality from sushi to sashimi to chicken teriyaki. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi joint. The sushi chefs are feiendly and good at making recommendations. They have happy hour Sunday thru Thursday. Try the Playboy12, and sweetheart. A but spicy, but oh so good!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time celebrating Cindy's  Birthday tonight.  The food was fresh and tasty.  The service was fast And friendly.  Everything was yummy   We drove all the way from Henderson and will come back   What a great time and experience we had"}
{"text":"fish are fresh but very slow in serving! We waited almost one hour and a half and couldn't get all our food been served. Oysters are small and abalones are not what we expected, it's a bit small than we thought. Besides, sushi are not made of sushi rice, it's regular rice. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"There are soooo many kinds of sushi right here!! The waitress is sooo professional n friendly!!! I will recommend this restaurant to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Delish! Try the blue fin tuna!! It's like eating velvet!!!! Everything was great! Great fresh tasting sushi, great service! The garlic edamani was amazing! Awesome happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I have ever been to. Eric is a fabulous sushi artist and person. Miss my weekly visits. The Vanessa roll is bomb ;-)"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we were very pleased with the service and cleanliness. The food was amazing! We ordered off the lunch special for $13 you get three ala cart items. We also ordered a couple Bento boxes and some sushi rolls. Everything was very authentic and fresh, not to mention affordable!   I would definitely return anytime I'm in the area or have a craving for authentic Japanese Cuisine"}
{"text":"Yummy is the right word to describe this restaurant's sushi! I love sushi!   There are a lot of \"All You Can Eat\" sushi places in town and a lot of super nice sushi restaurants that are either too expensive or on the strip. This restaurant is the perfect place if you are looking for good sushi that won't break the bank and is off the strip.   The restaurant is on the smaller side, so come early or expect to wait a few minutes for a place to sit. Enjoy! :)  Added: The Dragon Roll and I always love a good Rainbow Roll with fresh fish."}
{"text":"Granted we were there around noon it was a little early so there wasn't anyone there.  The service was prompt and we were attended to well. Hibatchi flavored Chilean Sea bass was to die for.  Spider roll was different than used too and was delicious.  I recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered combination fried rice and O roll 2. Fried rice was very oily and flavor was not good and expensive for what you get. The roll was very small for a $10 roll, it should have been $7-8 only."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE!!! I have had sushi from Israel to Italy to NewYork to Miami to California to Indiana to Gainesville, and this place was AMAZING. The quality of fish is delectable from all over the world! Eric is amazing! It's a local place not like you'll find in the crazy hotels which I also tried while I was here. I will DEFINITELY a be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Dinner time is quick and easy... The food is always good here!!  The Shrimp fried rice is yummy and the pot stickers are always a big hit. My favorite are the cream cheese ragoons... good stuff!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 3 years now & I love it every time . Staff is always so friendly and welcoming . I always sit at the bar alone and the men are always pleasant to be around , the food is always so good and fresh , I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered . Clean restaurant too! I recommend this place to anyone looking to have good food and good vibes !"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place! Everybody is so nice and the service is great! All the fish is fresh and taste so authentic. Love it here."}
{"text":"Went to this place a couple of times and enjoyed the sushi. Recently dined there and while sitting having a meal, I saw a cockroach crawling on the wall behind my husband. :-( Needless to say we both lost our appetite. I told the waitress and a guy came over looking for it. The little girl seated next to us pointed out the cockroach to him of which he grabbed a napkin to catch it. The waitress/cashier didn't even offer a discount at least for the gross experience we had. Needless to say, they've lost our business!"}
{"text":"Bad service.  Forgot about my roll completely, then lied about it.  When I finally got my roll the fish smelled fishy.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"After hearing that this place was great, my husband and I stopped in for a light dinner. I don't know why we waited so long- this is the best sushi restaurant in Vegas. The place is small inside but felt cozy instead of cramped. We sat at the bar and took our server's suggestion to try something from the daily specials. I'm so glad we did! We also ordered two rolls which were huge and sooo delicious. They even customized one of the rolls per our request. The prices were a heck of a lot cheaper than the strip and the food was so much better. All of the employees were super nice and attentive. We live a mile away and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was going to eat at Quiznos next door, but decided to try Yummy's...and I'm very glad I did. I've lived in Vegas for 3 years and had yet to find a \"good\" sushi place. Since I had never eaten there I was a little skeptical so I stuck to the \"basic\" rolls. I got the spicy tuna and a cali roll. They were SO fresh! The spicy tuna was by far the best I've ever had. I will return many times over! Can't wait to try something else...."}
{"text":"Great sushi quality! Every time I crave that otoro or blue fin this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth fresh fish.... prepared in a unique and fresh way is why I'll be back! A small storefront restaurant, they have about 8 tables and a sushi bar. We started with a great cucumber salad in ponzu with toasted sesame. They offered a Korean pancake as a complimentary starter, which was very yummy!The server was wonderful and and pointed out their signature rolls, which have crazy names! Try \"Smells like my old girlfriend\" (see what I mean?), which was a sweet and savory mix of fish and topped with crunch flakes! The tuna was fresh from HI and the spicy tuna roll just melted in your mouth. \"Dante's Inferno\" hit the spot with jalapeno and chilli sauce. Great unique flavors melded together perfectly with really, really fresh, high quality fish. You pay for it, but somethings are worth it!"}
{"text":"Sushi Friday's spent here, very fresh tasty fish and a wide variety. Chefs are great, always yummy."}
{"text":"Good won ton min but hardly any seats for big parties 6 or more."}
{"text":"This place has some rare fish and sea food items that you can't find at other places. The fish is high quality and really fresh. We were glad to find this place, it's worth the drive from the stripe."}
{"text":"Wed afternoon, 3PM - Fantastic sushi and service.  Employee synergy was so good I had to ask the sushi chef (not the owner) whether or not it was a family owned restaurant.  My internal SushiBar was set by a once amazing Japanese sushi bar in Hollywood, a family run (in its heyday) bar I've frequented since I was a child.  Only today have I run into anything comparable.  Service was great - neither the chef nor server were overly talkative, but both were really pleasant, polite and attentive (I was waiting a moment as I'd ordered 2 of the most elaborate rolls I saw).  Despite my having ordered my sushi to-go, the chef served me a cucumber salad and the waitress brought water, which was kind.  I ordered three rolls, one of which was the Touchdown roll on the recommendation of an earlier reviewer - NICE!  I've forgotten the names of the other two rolls but, at the moment, I'm calling them all delicious.  The fish tasted fresh and I thought I could taste everything used in the rolls.  Impressive."}
{"text":"Literally left another place that called itself a sushi restaurant and drove across town to come here.  Life is too short to eat bad sushi!!!  The Blue Fin here is always over-the-top, I'll never need sex again yummy!  The toro is melt in your mouth tender delicious! Not the stringy and chewy red stuff other places try to pass off as toro!  Always (almost always) a large selection of live items.  Don't bother with rolls or rice... You want to taste the fish here!!!  Stunning!  Our Faves:  Blue Fin, Toro, Giant Clam, Live Scallop, White tuna, Albacore... And everything else on the menu for that matter!!!  Make the drive!  (Note: This is NOT the same as Yummy Grill in Henderson!! Do not base your decision to go here on an experience there!!! This is a REAL sushi restaurant and bar!!! With REAL artists at what they do!!)"}
{"text":"The beak sushi in town, fish is always fresh, very small place but worth the wait. I go there almost once a week, best food, best sushi, best service, best all the around"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place! Fresh, delicious, and punctual!! There customer service is fantastic!! They never make me wait and it's always packed going in the restaurant!! I really love coming here there touchdown and crazy horse are addicting can't just have one bite!! I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"You don't have to spend a lot of money to experience great quality of sushi...and eating at yummy grill lets you do just that. I absolutely love sushi and I love this place too. Excellent customer service from staff as well!"}
{"text":"Not my style of sushi, and service was not good. Waitress did a poor job answering questions, probably due to a language barrier, but it did cause issues. The waitress neglected to explain a friend that her roll had crab when she explicitly asked what was in her roll and she had to send it back and order something else completely.   There are no simple basic rolls/sashimi - everything is covered in a mound of toppings and sauces. I'm not a fan of that type of sushi, so I wasn't impressed. If you like over the top sushi, this place probably has something for you."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! Some of the best sushi I've ever had. I got the paradise roll which had coconut and it was seriously delicious. The fish is incredibly fresh and the chefs were one of the best parts of the whole experience. They were super funny, nice, and extremely knowledgable! If I'm ever in Vegas again I'll definitely be going back. Also the price was A+ very inexpensive compared to the stuff you'd get on the strip!"}
{"text":"Customer service is great. Staff is friendly. I went there with friends. I ordered the screaming orgasm, chicken teriyaki, and spam musubi. All were yummy. I recommend this place to people who enjoy sushi and hawaiian, chinese food."}
{"text":"To start we tried the Last Samari which was deliciously smooth and fresh. Next we tried a Kiss of Fire which we initially expected to be reaching for our waters after one bite but surprisingly greeted with a roll that was packed full of flavor with just the right amount of \"kick.\" Flavors complimented each other very nicely. Lastly we tried the Stuffed Tomato which was bursting with flavor, very rich, but the best part of this role was the customer service we received from James? and another wonderful sushi chef who not only delivered great sushi but interesting conversation. We received an introductory education into quality fish and are very much looking forward to coming back to continue our sushi education! We can't imagine going to any other sushi place in the valley. Thank you Yummy! - Grace and Matt"}
{"text":"First time here and finally know what all the fuzz is about. There are many good sushi places in town and you can definitely add this one to the list. \"Playboy and tastes like my ex - girlfriend\" these rolls were an orgasm in my mouth. Very fresh, I will be back..."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The food is to die for and their service is always on point. Their teriyaki bowls are a great lunch option!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi.   Garlic tuna, spicy tuna & crunchy shrimp.    Very helpful waitress to explain dishes."}
{"text":"Great \"American style\" sushi = fancy rolls with lots of components, sauces, etc. We drove out here on our last visit to Vegas and rather than paying lots of $ for mediocre sushi near the strip, we decided to find a great place that locals go to and drive there. Thank you Yelp for helping us find Yummy Sushi. We will definitely come back here for sushi on our next trip out - these locals were not wrong!!"}
{"text":"I would just like to preface this review by saying that; I have never been a sushi person & always thought it was the most over hyped, band wagon-y type food out there & I never wanted anything to do with it. And yes, I had tried it before & gave it a chance, but it was never something that I would say; \"Hey, let's go out & get some sushi!\"   Well...things done changed! I would just like to give credit where credit is due. Thank you Cresta I. for opening my eyes!! I have had the pleasure of sharing a few great meals with Cresta. However, this was by far the best & most amazing!   I agreed to go with her to YG&S for her pre work meal, after my impromptu flash mobesque UYE @ Retro Bakery, purely as moral support though. All the while, she was telling me I was going to try this, that & the other, and of course I was telling her that I would in fact not be trying any of it.   So, I ordered my chicken fried rice & she ordered a Joy roll, a Philadelphia roll, and a fresh, raw scallop. Finally, after much prodding & insisting on Cresta's part, I reluctantly tried the Philly roll. Not bad. So, at which point I had nothing to lose & I tried the Joy roll. OMFG!! So fresh & delicious! I was really blown away. And, it only got better. The scallop was freakin' amazing! Like nothing I have ever tasted before. The flavors were just so fresh & clean. The ponzu that comes on the scallop is just the right amount of citrusy kick that this dish needs. I was a little wary of the tiny roe & expected it to be fishy & salty. I could not be more wrong. I could not taste anything really, and I just felt the little \"pops\" in my mouth, like tiny little roe just hugging my taste buds. Well, that would be the best way to describe it anyway :P  Having said all of that; I will admit that I have conformed & will publicly admit it in this forum, amongst all of my esteemed Yelp peers, that I officially like sushi."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened. I went to this resaturant with my boyfriend and daughter for dinner.  I read really good reviews about it. So we come in. Staff greeted us and we were seated immediately. It wasn't busy. We ordered our drink. I order hot green tea, my boyfriend orders hot sake. My tea was lukewarm, and tasted deluted and old. I was very disappointed.  We start ordering our sushi and rolls. Meanwhile,  the family in front us is ordering their meal, and a new couple is seated behind us a few minutes later.  We are waiting and waiting and waiting. The waitress,  is fly by us with no eye contact. The family in front of us has received all their food, and still our table hasn't been served. Finally, we were fed up once the couple behind us starts getting their food. My boyfriend is able to pull the waitress over to our table to complain about the long wait. And she starts telling us that she has placed the order, but if she tells the chefs again they will get mad. That's not my problem, we have been waiting more than 30 minutes. The family in front of us has finished, paid, left, and replaced by new people. Once we complain, our food starts rolling in, but our sushi is over powered by wasabi. We lift the sushi off the rice and huge chunks of wasabi are squeezed between fish and rice. I cleaned some of it off, but my boyfriend was very disappointed, he didn't eat any of his food. Once done we get an $80-something bill. The girl appologized. And gave us a $10 discount. But I think that is the last time we go there. I was very shocked, especially because of all the great reviews I read about it.    :("}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the people and service are great, and Eric is the best. If you haven't been, you're doing yourself a disservice. Love the eel here."}
{"text":"Every time I go here it's amazing.  We met Eric his first week when he opened and we haven't looked for another sushi restaurant. Amazingly fresh fish and the staff and chefs go above and beyond each time."}
{"text":"I don't even eat sushi and I've been to Yummy Grill more times than I can count. Why? This place stays open LATE. And they serve inexpensive, paint-stripper sake. And very decent chicken teriyaki plates that come on top what is essentially a small salad, which I always appreciated. Great garlic edamame and reverse happy hour values. Hands-down my favorite place to go after hours when I don't want to leave the neighborhood or go to a sad casino-sportsbar; Yummy Grill is always full of lively (drunk) people and efficient service.  Giving a three because this place isn't exactly a cultural or culinary standout- it's just real good at what it does: be an affordable, late-night ,extremely decent place to pick up sushi and relax with friends."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped in for lunch early Saturday afternoon. The staff was welcoming and kind. We sat at the sushi bar and lived watching the chefs hard at work. Suggestions were given when we asked and Rey allowed my hubby to order off the regular menu while sitting at the bar, not all sushi bars allow this.  The food was amazing! Honestly, we have eaten a great deal of sushi in Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada and Yummy Grill & Sushi ranks as a contender for #1. We had tuna that was so tender it melted in our mouth. I liked that the cut rolls were bit size as there is nothing worse than large pieces that you have to try and bite through the seaweed. These were perfect and full of sushi, not just a bunch of rice. Everything was well priced and defiantly worth every penny.  Thank you for a great lunch date, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my friends birthday. The food was really good! The meat was grilled perfectly. The macaroni salad had a little bit too much mayonnaise but other than that, a really good Hawaiian/Japanese fusion place! Service was also good and the people were friendly. The price was also very reasonable. For 3 combo platter and a avocado sushi roll, it came out to about 36 dollars. The combos had a lot on the plate too. At least 2 types of meat, rice, and macaroni salad. Leaving satisfied!"}
{"text":"La fraîcheur et exceptionnelle,  vous ne payez pas pour le décor mais vraiment pour la   des poissons. Mémorable"}
{"text":"I can't believe it. I may no longer be heading to Sushi Mon for my sushi.... I am absolutely loving this place. From the staff to the food--everything was awesome. Situated off of Lakemead and Tenaya, is where you'll find this hidden gem. We came here around 9pm, sat at the bar, and was greeted by a nice server and a talented sushi chef(Wen I believe was his name) and ordered the following : --teriyaki chicken dinner plate(guy's order) huge portion;enough to split btwn two people;came with CA rolls,shrimp and veggie tempuras, and salad--the bf said chicken was \"moist and not rubbery\" --salmon and tuna nigiri-amazingly fresh and very very good. They also don't give you measly little pieces.. --toro(fatty tuna)- highlight of the night(food wise) this is by far the best piece of fish I have ever had in my life and take it from me, I LOVE fish. --spicy shrimp with yum yum- honestly, I've had A better version of this, but who cares?! Everything else made up for it! The good thing about it was that the specially made this for us since it wasn't on the menu, so they get an A for that. --Eel- I could eat it all day! Yum!! --ice cream tempura- its hard to mess this up and was expecting it to be like everywhere else's: WRONG! Huge ass portion and they added chocolate sauce! That's what's up..  Ya ya, bill was 63 bucks..but when dinner is that good, I'd gladly hand them my money. But I think the other highlight of the night was when we ended up chopping it up with the chef/owner Eric. The amount of passion this guy has with the food he serves, his restaurant, and especially his clients is amazing. And I think it all shows through his food, staff, and even the other patrons we met in the restaurant. It was a great experience coming here for sure and  would love to come right back!"}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall spot for sushi. We had four speciality rolls (Ichiban, kiss of fire, Nemo, and touchdown) with mango cheesecake for dessert. Left feeling satisfied and not overly stuffed or heavy. I recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Fresh, unique fish and great service.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants something different. Don't forget to check in."}
{"text":"I love me some Yummy Sushi  but they need to be consistent!   I get better service at the bar then at the tables.  OH and happy hour is just half size.   not worth it to me!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had. The place looks like a hole in the wall...cheap...but quality of food is superb. Service is decent. Food is awesome!"}
{"text":"I am a sushi snob. Coming from San Francisco, we are spoiled with several incredible sushi restaurants. My girlfriend and I searched yelp for the best sushi restaurant we could find based on ratings, photos, reviews, menu, etc.  On the way to Yummy Sushi, the taxi driver mentioned that most of the chefs from the strip travel to this particular sushi joint, as it is one of the best in Las Vegas. Upon walking through their doors, we were warmly greeted by all of the staff including the chefs behind the bar. Please keep in mind we visited the evening of July 4th. The place was full! Every table was taken, which was fine because I always prefer to sit at the bar and talk sushi with the chefs.   We ordered nigori sake to start, with fresh seaweed salad that was on point! I told the server, and our chef, that we wanted to order the omakase. In other words, we will leave it up to the chef to choose our dinner items. The fish was incredibly fresh, the highest quality, and had many exotic options which were in season. As far as the quality of food, variety of options, and freshness of the fish - Yummy Sushi is 5 out of 5 stars. Now here is the best part of our experience, which places Yummy Sushi in an unparalleled category that couldn't possibly be matched by any of the competitors in Vegas.  We had to call a taxi to get back to the hotel in time to catch the fireworks. We waited 40 mins and no taxi showed up. We asked the gal at the front to call and check on the taxi, which she did and discovered it would be at least another 30 mins. We called a second taxi company which was an hour and a half wait!!!   A few minutes later, we were approached by one of the chefs who happened to be the owner of Yummy Sushi. He insisted on giving us a ride back to our hotel. We were blown away by his generous offer to leave his restaurant and taxi us back. We had an enjoyable, pleasant conversation on the ride back. He was truly a nice, kind, gentle, generous man. He refused our $20 tip for the ride. Again, we were amazed at his generosity. This is one of the best experiences we have had at a restaurant, sushi or not. Do yourself a favor and visit Yummy Sushi asap. You will not be disappointed. Thank you again for taking such wonderful care of your customers. You could have taken our money and let us figure out a way back on our own. Instead, you went above and beyond and made our trip that much better. We will definitely be visiting your restaurant the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Had live sea urchin.  Rice was overcooked but they quickly replaced it.  Food was awesome and staff are super friendly,,,"}
{"text":"One of the sushi chefs had flimsy bandaid wrapped around the tip of his finger. It would not have been a big deal if he had a glove on that hand, but he didn't. Not only did he not have a glove on, the band aid was wrapped cylindrical around THE VERY TIP OF HIS FINGER. Do you understand why this is a deal breaker? The wound is NOT COMPLETELY SEALED!!!!! The band aid has a breach in which food is exposed to the wound and vice versa!!!! He used his fingers TO DIG OUT CRAB and and place it on the sushi!!! I saw with my eyes the bits fall from his fingers back into the container and the build up ON AND IN THE OPENING OF THE BAND AID!!!!!!!!!!! DISGUSTING! AND DANGEROUS! SHAME ON YOU!! We couldn't have gotten out of there fast enough! I can't go back there. My stomach wouldn't allow it. I'm feeling nauseous just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"My fav sushi place in LV. Especially for the price, just can't be beat.  Uni and Toro are out of this world good. This is fancy sushi restaurant quality in a casual environment with very moderate prices. If there is a better sushi restaurant at this price point anywhere in the world outside Japan let me know, because I've not been to one.   Sit at the sushi bar where the chef treats you like a guest in his home and shares his love for sushi with you. He is not Japanese, but why does that even matter? If you are truly passionate about your craft then that is all that matters. Its not like the best Muay Thai fighters are all Thai."}
{"text":"Great food and if it's possible, better customer service.  I called ahead and ordered a vegetable roll, oshinko, and avocado.  The super friendly and nice woman on the phone said it would be 15min so I headed down then.  When I got there, my rolls weren't ready (they were busy) so i sat at the bar to wait.  She brought me water and a free appetizer as i played \"Words With Friends\"(Niklas87   Holla!)    while waiting.  The rolls were delicious and the Avocado was the best I ever had.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Such a great Chinese restaurant! I order here even couple of weeks and they always get our orders correct!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out and the lady on the phone was so rude. I had the poki and tempura. The poki was good but the tempura was awful. It was soggy and tasteless."}
{"text":"They dont care unless u order some over priced shit. Cheesy place.. waited 45 mins for couple sashimi to start."}
{"text":"Well I returned to my favorite sushi restaurant yummy's well I was very disappointed I went in and ordered a kiss a fire roll and several other rolls ale and a tempura dinner after tasting the kiss of fire roll I felt as though something was a little bit tainted maybe one of the fishes wasn't as fresh as it should be I had taken two bites and attempted to send it back they were insistent on charging me for it when they total came which I gladly paid and will never return to again after being a loyal client of theirs for eight years apparently they don't care about their people or the quality of fish that they're serving so I find that with some much competition this town I could definitely spend my money out of better mom-and-pop place sorry Emmys but no Boineau baby Best to  read ALL the reviews yummys surly isn't what it once was"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute must!!! I highly recommend this place to EVERYONE. Hands down the freshest sushi in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Small place but great food on the inside. The guys are super friendly! The ladies act like they are too busy to help you....but the food is amazing!!  Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"We are here for the first time last night. Not sure why it's taken us three years of living close by to try it. Hands down some of the best sushi I have ever had. The place is small so we made a reservation it was our wedding anniversary so we definitely wanted a seat and not have to wait especially since we have little kids. The waitress was super friendly made awesome recommendations everything she recommended was incredibly fresh and delicious. She was very attentive and everyone that brought us our dishes were great. They even brought out a couple complementary items. We decided to splurge and order the live raw lobster and it was beyond my expectations I have never had anything so incredibly good. The lobster was prepared three ways : lobster tail sashimi , The head and claws were prepared in a creamy still with vegetables and citrus, and a miso soup with lobster pieces. The chef brought out the live lobster to show me before he prepared I thought that was really cool. We also had the Toro cheek sashimi that was so buttery and good. Next time we go we will make a reservation for the Omakase. Our waitress told us that's the way to go to try a bunch of different items. Not all you can eat so the prices were a little bit more than what we normally spend on sushi but it was worth every penny especially the lobster.  Cannot wait to go back. I have a feeling we will be regulars especially since we live so close by. For people visiting out of town it's definitely worth the trip off the strip better than any sushi I've had on the strip"}
{"text":"This place has really great sashimi and rolls.  Definitely very fresh fish and lots of flavor in their special rolls. Service was decent. The sushi chefs seem to really enjoy what they do, as they were having a blast. Very engaging with customers, taking saki shots with everyone. I'll definitely come  back."}
{"text":"We went half hour before they closed,  the food was AMAZING,  totally worth the wait!  They made us a free appetizer for waiting and the mango cheesecake was phenomenal! !!! Service was great,  we will definitely be making this one of our regular stops for late night Sushi craving!"}
{"text":"So loyal to this sushi joint I don't care to go anywhere else! Chefs are always friendly, sushi is always fresh and full of flavor! Happy hour starts at 10pm huge menu check it out"}
{"text":"These guys have hands down the freshest fish in the valley and some stuff i haven't even seen at other places, such as live abalone. Friendly staff, great prices, and audio that's to die for."}
{"text":"So I went to this place because it was close by my house. I get there and i had to seat myself. It took them 10 minutes to bring me a menu. And then 15 minutes later somebody came to take my drink order. After waiting another 20 minutes. I left because nobody ever cane back to take my order. So then I wee b outside thinking that i can order over the phone because i really wanted some sushi. The girl that answered the phone put me on hold for another 10 minutes. The customer service is very rude here. Never even got to eat here. And won't be going back"}
{"text":"I love...LOVE Yummy Grill. The bento boxes are fantastic and very affordable. Great tempura and sushi. Love it"}
{"text":"Me and my wife's favorite sushi spot the screaming orgasme is my wife's favorite and they have udon Ramen better than most Ramen shops plus the sushi is cheap and delicious"}
{"text":"What a great place. Everything we ordered was delicious. Great variety of food and terrific atmosphere. Prices are excellent for the amount and quality of food you get. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I do not understand why this place has so many good reviews.  I usually give a place a second try if I have a first bad experience but the food was that bad that I will never return.   I was here for dinner late night on a Friday.  It was refreshing to not see an AYCE sushi place. I had read reviews of how fresh the fish was. I had high hopes that this place was good since it's not too far from home.    Dinner consisted of mainly nigiri and a few rolls. The sushi rice was horrific. Very mushy and unappetizing.  The nigiri was very inconsistent with the amounts of wasabi. The fish I had did not seem fresh at all. I would definitely not be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh fish!  The screaming orgasm and cherry blossom are dishes you should not miss. Make a reservation as it is a small venue."}
{"text":"The food is okay.... just an ordinary sushi place in the mall complex. The live shrimp was good. The home made wasabi that cost $7 extra was not worth it. Too much filler with little horse radish or whatever they used to make it with. Uni dish.. they say the uni is live uni... but it was not fresh enough (not creamy enough). Personally, i think the uni was dead when showing. The rice below the uni was mixed with seaweed that was over cooked. NOT fresh. Soft shell crab was okay... the crab was okay but the coating was awful. Too much of the breading that I could barely taste the crab itself. Most importantly, the sashimi was not cut right and it had too much lemon taste to it too. It is bazzar that they put lemon before serving. I dont put lemon on my sashimi because the acidity ruins the taste. I only put lemon on when the fish is not fresh...  Overall, the taste of the food was not balanced.  I gave 2 stars because of the kindness of the servers not for the food. If you are seeking authentic Japanese food, do not go here. Definitely not worth the detour for this kind of food."}
{"text":"I gave them a long break and wanted to give them another chance, these 5 stars are for the super thick, buttery soft, salmon nigiri. It was amazing! The other items( Mexican roll, tiger roll 2, spicy crab, and California crunch roll) were all great too. I'm very glad I gave them another go, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"After trying a TON of sushi places in Vegas,  we keep coming back here. The freshness, price and service really can't be beat and the variety on the menu keeps my not so \"sushi crazy\" fiance perfectly happy.  I just wish they offered all you can eat, but we always get plenty of food for $35 ish"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good. We order way to much food so we were glad to have lunch for the next day for the price. The rolls didn't look that nice and it took a little while for us to get our order. Staff was nice and very helpful. It's a small location, not great for a big group."}
{"text":"When you enter Yummys you're greeted by the chefs That is always very important to me. The service is great. The food is so good. The presentation is beautiful. Great experience. I will continue to come back here and recommend to others. Thanks Yummy!"}
{"text":"This freakin' place rocks!!  Every single time I come to Vegas I make sure to come to Yummy Sushi on Lake Mead.  I specify the location because it's hard to believe there are people out there posting 1 star for this gem!  Are they in the right place???  These guys get the freshest and best fish and if you love sashimi, they cannot be beat. I travel for business and find the top places in many cities in the USA.  This one consistently ranks as the best, and my home base is Manhattan!  Their blue fin toro is stupendous!  All their fish is fresh and they have many LIVE menu items. The scallops are insane and I can go on and on.  Give this place a shot..you will not be disappointed!  Dave from JERSEY!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight craving sushi! Definitely satisfied that craving. Will definitely come back when were in town!"}
{"text":"The sushi here was so good! I want to say it's the best in north side Vegas. The staff was super friendly and helpful with the menu options. NOT AYCE! But I think that is why the quality is so much better. I'll make sure to take more photos next time but the food was eaten so quickly. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place where they care about you as a customer don't come here. They won't do anything about it. Tried to switch out a seafood dish for meat and they said no. Then they kicked us out!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a good spicy soup and got a GREAT spicy soup, Spicy Ramen to be exact.  Friendly staff and fast service.  Highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Best Sushi place I ever been to! My favorite one here is the Blue Fin! Chefs are great, servers are so friendly, quality is high. My husband and I always come here. We also love they have a happy hour! :D"}
{"text":"I've noticed that the majority of bad reviews on this \"4.5 star\" restaurant are from Californians. There's a really good reason for that. Apparently I should've read the reviews more carefully before I went to this terrible restaurant.  Coming from Los Angeles and having stellar sushi (no, not rolls, sushi), I should've judged the book by its cover. Driving up to this location, I could already see that it was a 'roll' place.  Live Uni for 22 bucks? No thanks. I can get the same thing in Los Angeles for 7 dollar a piece.  My family simply ordered the combo meals. I myself had a beef teriyaki plate. Why would I get that at a sushi place? I'm not quite sure. But I guess being on vacation threw me off.  Anyways, the food was cold when it came out to me. It was disgusting. The beef was cold, the tempura was cold, and altogether this joint just doesn't deserve the 4.5 stars it has. I feel so bad for those people who think this place is the best sushi joint ever. I think it just says that Vegas lacks a proper sushi restaurant. When you're in Los Angeles, go to Little Tokyo. Any of those restaurants with good OR bad reviews will top this place.  Avoid this place. Expensive, disgusting."}
{"text":"Great service with fresh sushi!!  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"So I have been wanting to try this place for some time now and here we go.   It's small. Very tight. BUT small doesn't always mean bad. It's clean. Fresh. And cute  Spider-Man roll. BIG there's a lot going on there. Spicy tuna. Soft shell crab. Shrimp tempura. Lots of flavors and just a big roll. I used my handy dandy chop sticks to cut it in half. But yummy  Dragon roll. Delicious. So delicious   The waitresses were attentive and nice. One who didn't speak much English I presume. We ordered cold sake, she brought us hot. Oh well. My husband likes hot sake and I prefer cold it's delicious either way.   We will be returning. The sushi is fresh. The restaurant is clean and charming. You're welcomed as soon as you walk in so"}
{"text":"This was my splurge on my budget trip and it was a great experience. Sat at the bar during happy hour. The sushi chef was so kind and attentive. Got edamame, large sake, 4 rolls and 4 nigiri for $30. They do not have AYCE-- basically the place is too good for that. If you want a cozy atmosphere and fresh fish well prepared, go to Yummy!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Vegas that didn't require going to the strip. The waitstaff are friendly and the food is awesome. Try the spicy pork, fried soft shell crab, combination fried rice as far as non-sushi goes. Sushi is great, different specialty rolls than other places but very good."}
{"text":"My bad perception of Yummy grill& Sushi has changed. Some years ago when this place first opened up I was very disappointed. At that time before the big remodel, I went in and ordered the lunch special to go which consisted of the main entree, soup and an appetizer. On the menu it didn't say anything about it not being available for take out and the counter guy didn't tell me anything. When I got my order I noticed that my bag was very light. It turns out that they gave me the main entree and the appetizer but not the soup. I felt like I was ripped off and never visited them again.  But this year when I looked at the pictures of this restaurant on Yelp I was very surprised because it changed. So I went in yesterday after work and ordered a lunch special of Eel on rice, salad, and soup from their new menu along with a sushi roll. While I was waiting the nice waitress gave me a little yummy appetizer. When my order came I was so happy to see that I got everything including the Soup and Salad. It all tasted great and I will visit again now that everything has gotten better."}
{"text":"I came here based on a friend's recommendation and I felt like I wasted a meal in Vegas. Perhaps the standards for sushi is different in Las Vegas.  We tried the live ama ebi and live abolone.  I was not impressed and the price was on the more expensive side. I can get better sushi and better deals in LA."}
{"text":"Wow!!  This place is amazing!!  First off, the staff is very helpful and very attentive.  Food was incredible!!  Nothing but amazing things to say about this place.  For sure will be coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy does have pretty amazing quality and selection of fish. I don't write reviews often but feel like they deserve a good write up. A small size restaurant, just 6 or 7 tables I think and maybe 12 seats at the bar.  I'd recommend to sit at the bar and order some of the freshest nigiri and sashimi in Vegas with a very reasonable price tag.  The 2 main chefs are amazing with their knife skills and artistry, other 2 helpers/apprentice type are ok. Try to get your nigiri made by the main chefs. If I feel for good quality sushi, I'd definitely come here or Sen of Japan, not one of those ayce places. This place is solid, even tho run by Koreans instead of Japanese like Sen of Japan."}
{"text":"I will never go back nor do I recommend unless you want to wait 30 mins for a meal & the same customer-service.  This place was packed so were fortunate to get the last seat. We both mentioned \"brown rice\"upon ordering however 30 mins later, x2 orders of white rice arrived at our table. I kindly reminded the waitress of our order & her reply wasn't apologetic yet defensive.  The bf confirmed we said brown rice. Instead she sourly mentioned that \"it's going to take a really long time to come out.\" I was quick to remind her it took 30 minutes for our meal & she replied \"we're still charging you whether you take it or not\" still never apologizing for the mistake.  I asked to rush it & take-to-go when I should have spoken to a manager. 3 mins after giving us our take out & bill, she said she was deducting the mis-order since she sensed my furry. She deducted it & despite the decent sushi, that's not customer service in any sense!"}
{"text":"I have been around the block a number of times when it comes sushi joints.  This place must be for children because the portions are the smallest i have ever experienced and it doesnt make up for it  in quality.  $14.75 for the smallest uni nigiris ever and they werent the best grade either when the going rate in the area is 8 to 11 dollars for better quality.  I probably would have apent 6 dollars on their uni.  The amaebi is small also.  Their 16oz beer seemed like 10oz to me.  This is the tip of the iceberg.  I have no idea where these positive reviews are coming from but take it from a real person....beware."}
{"text":"Great sushi, I absolutely love this place. It's one of my regular sushi spots. I always get my favorites the Johnny roll and the California baked. This place always has great service and they're fairly priced compared to most sushi places."}
{"text":"First time at Yummy and did not disappoint. We will definitely be back. Had several rolls like the Tomo Devil which was spicy and crunchy. We also had the stuffed tomato roll which clean, fresh and creamy. Had the miso soup with clams which was briny and delicious. Service was super. Overall great!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent.  They get super busy on the weekend nights. So sometimes when I call for pick up it could take 45 minutes to an hour to be ready."}
{"text":"Yummy has an impressive selection of fresh fish, they have daily specials with unusual fish that you wouldn't expect in a typical sushi restaurant.  My recommendation for raw fish lovers is to sit at the bar and let one of the chefs serve you whatever they have fresh that day, they never disappoint.  (If your whole order consists of rolls, you don't like sushi).   Bonus: Asahi on draft; wasabi leaf (better than the horseradish fake wasabi); the staff is extremely friendly and seems happy to be working there.   Best memories at Yummy: O-toro (absolutely dreamy), blue fin tuna and mackerel, incredibly yummy quality.   Also, the best nigiri is served with room temperature rice, slightly warm even better, the fish shouldn't be too cold, it doesn't have as much flavor.  And who cares if one of the chefs isn't Asian?  Thank you Eric for keeping your menu fresh and exciting!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch when craving Udon noodles. I ordered an appetizer of fried shrimp, which was bigger than I had assumed it would be, and some plum sake. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, and the sake was more pleasant than I had been expecting. They brought me a vegetable pancake on the house while waiting for my order, I think because I had arrived just after opening and it was taking slightly longer than normal, although I was in no rush and not bothered by the wait. The staff was very attentive with refilling my water, which I drank quite a lot of given the heat that day. The guy making sushi behind the counter was always busy, either cutting fish or cleaning something. It gave me the impression that the place is heavy on cleanliness, which I appreciate. The Udon that I ordered finally came, I got the beef, and it was fantastic. The noodles were spot on how I had hoped they would be, the beef was perfectly cooked, had a great flavor, and I found no gristle or fat at all. The veggies were fresh, and everything jived just perfectly for my craving. I'll definitely be going back here. I recommend it highly, although it's a casual place, so I wouldn't be bringing someone from out of town who's looking for the chintzy glitz of the Strip."}
{"text":"Great sushi, and the service is outstanding! The place is quite small but worth the wait. They will however take reservations. A must try if you love sushi!"}
{"text":"Pros: good miso soup, decent prices   Cons: mushy edamame, inconsistent roll sizes with some far too large, fishy smell and taste, \"screaming orgasm\" sauce on the OH rolls looks like oily water mixed with chunks of mayo. The dining area is very drafty when the front door opens.   I would not recommend visiting this location. The one on Tenaya and Lake Mead has better reviews so that may be worth a shot."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were at the Target in the same lot and decided to try this place out for the first time. Their menu is on the window and they have a lot on their menu. Customer service was really good and their portions are big. I had ordered the combo of teriyaki beef and it came with miso soup, salad, and 4 piece California roll. My boyfriend ordered the loco Moco. He really enjoyed his plate, but unfortunately my teriyaki beef was really dry and there were pieces where it tasted burnt. The dressing on the salad tasted unusual as if there was a lot of onions and off sweet taste.  And the bathroom, it was disgusting in there. It looked like it wasn't clean in several days such as the floor, the entire toilet, and the sink. I doubt we will try this place again."}
{"text":"What can I say but awesome! A bit pricey but the best sushi in town. They have some of the freshest seafood of any sushi restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Everytime i come home to vegas i make sure i have my meat jun plate :) there is never a time i dont come here when im in town. My husband always has the yummy combo and it is alwats so yummy. My mom and i will stop in for sushi when we are craving for sushi  but most of the time its always their meat jun. Its always been my fav spot even when i used to live here. When i leave vegas i end up craving for it all over again lol. Maybe they will consider expanding out to California; )   The staff is always so nice too. Thanks guys for always satisfying my appetite!   Its so good that i have to admit, i had the meat jun for lunch today and then went back to have sushi for dinner lol"}
{"text":"WHAT A GEM!  In a strip mall - near PEP Boys is one of the best sushi places I've eaten in - and that includes New York, San Fran, London and Paris. I admit my first love is a good steak, but for fresh fish you won't do better in Vegas than here. The chefs come to your table, are willing to make whatever you want, offer free samples based on what you've ordered, all with reasonable prices (my friend and I had 3 roll entrees, miso soup and cucumber salad, all for under $50 including the taxes and tip)   My Passion roll (crab, shrimp tempura, coconut flakes, avocado, cream cheese, yum yum, eel sauce) melted the blended tastes in my mouth perfectly. My friend had Takoyaki (octopus balls with some sort of deep fried radish that kept her talking about the taste hours after the meal) She also had a Rainbow roll (spicy crab, with salmon, tuna, yellowtail and shrimp) She liked it just a tad less than the Takoyaki. The miso soup was the best either of us ever had. The cucumber salad was our least favorite. It reminded us more of a Korean type dish, and while it was tasty, we would have preferred something closer to traditional Japanese. This will definitely be a regular place for us weekly."}
{"text":"Two words: DELICIOUS & FRIENDLY! This place is sooooooo good! A first I came in here to look at their menu while the waitress kindly asked if I would like to sit at the sushi bar while I looked it over. Another then asked if I would like something to drink. They were so nice I decided to give them a try. I had never been here before, and they were kind enough to make some suggestions of rolls based on what I liked. I chose the playboy roll with was amazing! The sushi chefs are really good and they are super friendly. They even gave me a Korean style pancake and a cucumber salad on the house! The staff is very attentive and the food is amazing. I love sushi and I love finding new places to try. This was a wonderful experience and I will definitely bring my boyfriend with me next time!"}
{"text":"Reviews are so fake! No authentic japanese food, be aware!  If u want to eat a hot egg sushi, come here, and get the foot smell of this egg. Price is fair, but totally out of my expectation."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to get a hat trick with Las Cazuelas and Windy City Beefs in the same center as this place(both 5 star eateries in my opinion...Check them out!) Unfortunately for Yummy Sushi, I love sushi and have eaten at the best, the worst and the in between. Yummy is somewhere at the bottom of the in-between unfortunately.   Not set up like a traditional Sushi bar, Yummy has a host that is taking orders while cooks prepare all food behind a semi closed kitchen island. The host and cashier did not smile, however, they had little to do with the rating. We ordered 4 rolls to go; fried Philly, spicy shrimp tempura and Japanese lasagna. Fried Philly had almost no batter and showed the seaweed paper, shrimp tempura was soggy and barely spicy and the Japanese lasagna was predominantly rice. Unfortunately, the lasagna was the worst I have had out of any sushi place and I order it everywhere since it is the one roll that has converted my girlfriend to becoming a sushi or at least a sushi roll enthusiast.   I hate to be so critical of this place, however, the surrounding restaurants and just about every other sushi place out there make it hard not to be. Also, despite the medium prices, there is no all you can eat. No all you can eat + 2 stars = what is the point?.....  All you can eat with great options and pricing in Henderson; Sin City sushi on Serene and Eastern is a great start followed by Sushi Mon on Maryland and Silverado Parkway. Both have awesome selection and all you can eat options. If you are looking for something a little fancier not for from the Henderson area, I suggest Zenshin in the South Point casino. From my 2 visits there they have had great sushi options as well as some nice custom libations. Beware however, they are a little steeper in price and do not have an all you can eat menu."}
{"text":"This menu is fantastic and I've loved every single thing I've ordered here. Clean area, good service, fast cooks, and quality taste. This is my new favorite neighborhood sushi!"}
{"text":"How did this place get so many good reviews??  Maybe I'm the weirdo here.  My experience starts with a watery diet Pepsi.  The albacore didn't seem to be the best cut.  Sashimi is giant thick chunks, not very light on the mouth.  The 911 roll was way salty (mouth is still salted out).  My other roll was only okay.  On the positive, all the fish is fresh, and they have a good selection.  You get a little cucumber salad to start, which was okay.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"After reading Yelp reviews we decided to check Yummy Sushi out on Christmas Eve. We called ahead to make sure it was not too busy and they said they were slow that night. We arrived at 10:30 pm and it was happy hour. We were the only ones there! They were extremely nice and seated us (two adults including myself and four Children, one in a high chair). My Husband of course wanted the live options per Yelp reviews. He ended up with everything live they had to offer! Chef Eric even came to the table with the live lobster to show exactly what he would be doing to prepare and serve it! Fantastic guy and fantastic Chef. They do offer a kids meal in which came with soup and a dessert! I ended up with two specialty rolls. Soooooo good! Best place for sushi in Nevada! Do not hesitate to try it. Also, must add that they are very clean and the bathrooms are very clean too. I am extremely picky when it comes to bathrooms in a food facility. I did check out the bathrooms before we ate!"}
{"text":"This is place to go for sushi. It was great foods, affordable, and amazing services! It's always busy, every time we come here!"}
{"text":"Not only is this the first ayce sushi I've had that tastes as good as many regular sushi bars,  the ayce menu has more variety than most ayce sushi places. The rice/sushi ratio is a little on the heavy side,  but still not too bad.  Service here is really friendly and amazing and your order will come out quickly."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of YUMMY, the fish is always fresh and the staff is always so welcoming. I make it a habit to stop in here every chance I get especially since I work so close by. The teriyaki is always delicious and they have an amazing salad that comes with the meal. I can't get enough of this lovely establishment. Keep up the amazing work Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Make sure to check-in with the mobile yelp app for the $10 off $45+ on your bill!  My boyfriend and I came on a friday night around 12am and it was packed. I heard and read good things about this place so why not? Their happy hour menu is pretty good with half-off on their select nigiri and simple rolls. They had a large house sake for $4.50 during happy hour.  Decor: Small, packed, loud. Clean. Kind of regret not grabbing a seat at the sushi bar! Faster service that way.  We ordered a few rolls (Johnny, That's What She Say) to start. It took 30-40 minutes to get 3 rolls types. By the end of the night we had 6 rolls, house sake, and two orders of gyoza in an hour and 40 minutes.  The fish was flavorful, fresh, rich, and delicious. Pretty generous on the fish as well. Presentation was beautiful. The sauces were drizzled with care on our rolls. The sushi itself tantalized our taste buds.   It's a bit pricey since it's all ala carte and we know it's not all-you-can-eat. For a non-AYCE joint, we expected maybe faster service despite the quality rolls. They came out at a snail's pace that we kept getting hungry in between finishing each roll dish. We felt a bit sorry for the lone waitress doing everything from cleaning, tending to other customers, getting side dish orders etc. She was doing her best to serve everyone though. Maybe the service wouldn't have suffered as much if they had another waitress/waiter or maybe an extra chef. Don't get me wrong, we didn't expect them to come out with our order immediately, but it took FOREVER to get each one!    For the price we paid (Around $80ish by the end of the night just between the two of us), I kind of wished we chose another place. It was a delicious meal, just not-so-great timing on the sushi. I don't mind paying for sushi, but if I'm paying quite a bit extra for an ala carte place, I expected a bit better in terms of timeliness. Maybe we'll come back and try it again on less busy night."}
{"text":"We recently had dinner there: 1 sushi roll, 1 spicy spamasubi and Salmon Katsu. Food was satisfying.  However, tables were dirty and had to flag someone to clean one for us to sit (she did, but didn't care to wipe the other dirty table next to us for the next customer, tsk tsk).  Took away a star for cleanliness.  P.S. when you come in remember that you have to order at the register, no waiter will come to you."}
{"text":"My niece is visiting from California but she recently moved to the States from Japan and we wanted to bring her to a Good sushi restaurant. We had Kazuko who spoke Japanese to my niece. She was so friendly and took time out of her busy day to talk with us about everything....food, American life and Las Vegas!  She was absolutely wonderful. I can't say enough about the excellent service and even better food. I'm so glad we tried Yummy Sushi and this will be our new place!!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in Las Vegas.  (Unless you are a Makino-style sushi eater.)  Yummy Grill & Sushi has the freshest, highest quality seafood in Vegas.  A true mom-pop hole-in-the-wall with friendly staff, great service and relaxing atmosphere, this is THE place for a great sushi experience. I've been there with my boyfriend and with a large group and both experiences have been wonderful.  I didn't know I loved live scallop, but it was fantastic. Sam is my favorite sushi chef."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is absolutely amazing!! It's a very small space, but it wasn't very packed when I went. I am pregnant and can't eat sushi, but I had such a huge craving for some yesterday so I stopped in and they made me a tempura California roll with cream cheese and it was SO good it melted in my mouth! The yummy sauce is very yummy! Their Miso soup is SO tasty ... In fact, I just talked myself in to stopping in there again tonight!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Vegas for a soccer tournament...looking for sushi...found Yummy Grill & Sushi on Yelp saw the 4.5 stars and gave it a go. LOVED IT!!! Excellent fish and service. Will go back for sure next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi joints in Vegas,  & i've been to a few... I haven't tried any sushi here that I didn't like. They are very fast also ! i LOVE it here !"}
{"text":"Got a seat at the bar at 7:45 on a Monday, just before the place filled up. The miso, garlic edamame, and gyoza from the kitchen were delicious. The cajun albacore, garlic tuna, salmon, and rolls were all well prepared with the perfect balance of flavors. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Happy Hour night. They close at 2am. I always enjoy my dining here. Service still good this late. Nigori kinda of pricey.  Sushi guys are fun to watch as they work hard to prepare the dishes. Always a variety of fresh fish. Free Korean pancake small portion pupu."}
{"text":"My friend and I were on a work trip and needed a place near our hotel to eat. This place hit the spot.  I got the salmon skin salad and Arizona roll.  My friend got the spicy garlic edamame and Rainbow roll.  The sushi rolls were very fresh and flavorful.  The edamame could have been more spicy and lies garlicky.  My favorite part was my salad. It was right on.  The service was excellent. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, no sense of urgency in this establishment. Three people ordered after me, two of which had been served before my small to go order of spicy shrimp tempura (which I'm still waiting for). Sucks. Where is the order? FCFS."}
{"text":"It's a good place to get chinese, hawaiian plate lunch, and sushi. Prices aren't too bad."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place.  We go once or twice a week,  every week!  They know us by name and we know them.  Love the food,  love the people,  love the sake, love the ice cream.  I have nothing bad to say about them.  My favorite!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi restaurants seem to be a dime a dozen here in Vegas. When I moved here, I struggled to find my favorite because of how many great places there are.   Well... I think I found it!   This is why Yummy Sushi is rad:   *Low key and subtle ambiance   *Super fresh fish and live shell fish   *Always have different types of fish coming in so the menu is constantly changing. Check the white board when you walk in   *Amazing service! Everyone in the place says what's up when you get there, and they yell good bye and thank you as you leave.   *If you sit at the bar... You will get VIP treatment, but not over the top. Everyone there is great, but Eddie is the one that made us start going back... Awesome attitude, creative rolls and sashimi, intelligent and genuine conversations... I've never been to a Sushi bar and left thinking to myself... Damn... Did we just become best friends?   *Typically, the other customers in there are great too. We've met some interesting and fun people hanging out in this place.   I've been here twice in the last week, and plan on doing the same this week.   If you've got a current Sushi spot and you're stoked on it... Great! But give these guys a try, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"It was one of the best sushi experiences ever!!! We tried sashimi with three different kinds of tuna and three different kinds of salmon from all over the world! We also ordered octopus, it was just fantastic! Chief Eric cooked for us :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to yummy for 8 years! This is my favorite sushi joint hands down. I love the owner ERIC he always makes you feel welcome. Also ordering sushi to go from here is the best! Sauces come on the side and its packaged perfectly! Its just yummy"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Vegas! Bold statement, I know, but definitely the best I've found. This is not the same place that's on Eastern Ave though so don't be confused even though the name and logo are the same."}
{"text":"All of my fav restaurants close on Sundays and I was craving some good Jap food.   We stumbled onto this place and I am so glad we did.  We got red snapper, Japanese uni, king salmon and ikura sushi. We also ordered beef and reg udons. Their adadame was soooooo yummy!!! It was cooked with garlic and yummy soy sauce.   Their sashimi was extremely fresh... as same as Sojo- their udons were legit too.   I strongly recommend this place. Just give it a try!! It is soo worth it!"}
{"text":"Yummy Grill and Sushi is a small Japanese, Chinese, and Hawaiian fusion restaurant.  It has a small dining room but large counter space for people that want to sit at the counter and be served sushi quickly.  I like taking my family here on Sundays after church.  There is something for everyone here.  There is a lot of menu items.  I personally love the honey walnut shrimp and the cucumber salad.  My wife loves the philly hand rolls and a large bowl of udon noodles.  My daughter loves the tamago rolls and miso soup.  The food here is prepared and served quickly.  The prices are reasonable, which is why I come often.  I call this place a fast, casual restaurant.  The staff is friendly and will do all they can to make sure that you have a good experience."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the Las Vegas area! Everything tastes so good! From sushi to teriyaki, this place is worth a visit! :-)"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have dined at Yummy Sushi.  The first time we dined here it was by chance; we were hungry and we're just cruising Lake Mead Blvd looking for a place to eat.  Had I written the review the first time, I would have given 4.5 stars.  The fish was fresh and delicious. We tend to get nigiri and sashimi only. The server was friendly and the sushi chefs too.  We had the same server and she is very friendly and nice.  Now, here is where it all goes awry.  We order a couple of hand rolls, it was good.  I love yellow tail, so I requested an order of hamachi nigiri.  The sushi chef prepares it and hands it to me while my man is away in the bathroom.  I look at it and it does not look like yellowtail.  I take one small bite and I can barely bit into it.  On top of that he tried to add something to the fish to make it more edible.  I still don't know what it was.   My man comes back from the bathroom and I look at him and he says \"what is that?\"  I said, \"supposedly yellowtail\".  My man takes a bite, looks at the sushi chef and says \"Yellowtail??\"  He only said one word with a question in his voice and the sushi chef immediately says, \"oh so sorry I give you better piece, I accidentally give you piece that was bleeding\".  What???  I have been eating sashimi for 15 years now, my man a little longer.  We know good sashimi.  He tried to pull one over on us and I felt really insulted.  He shouldn't be serving that to anyone, even if they hadn't known the difference.  Shame on you owner and sushi chef! (slap on the hand)  I thought I had found a great place to have sushi in town, now I will have to resume my search.  I never mess around with raw fish, all it takes is one bad experience for me to scrap a place.  Your place is officially scrapped Sir!  I know I am a dissenting review and perhaps he was having a *moment* whatever. SCRAPPED!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi place, fresh fish and very friendly staff  reasonable price compare with high quality fish. Highly recommend,. Also thank to chef for free compliment full size Toro to us before we leave.  Already miss you from LA"}
{"text":"Have wanted visit this place for a longtime.  Finally made it for happy hour today.  We were greeted shortly after entering and sat at the sushi bar so we could watch the action.    Initially confused by the three items for the menu.  You get a happy hour checklist, regular menu checklist and a normal menu.    We ordered:  Live abalone Live soft shell crab Bluefin tuna Salmon  Salmon belly Mackerel Salmon roe Albacore belly Sea conch Eel roll Arizona roll Something Wrong roll Fresh wasabi  They also gave us comped seaweed salad and pieces of a pancake type item.  Short story is that everything was high quality and very tasty.  Our only qualm was the eel roll.  That one roll only had a pencil size sliver of eel on it.  It was tasty but disappointing.  It was a happy hour item and if that was the standard serving I would not order it again.  Hence the four star rather than five.  The staff and chefs were all friendly, helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and have always had a good experience. The staff is friendly and the food is very good for the price. Just had a meal with Chef Dan and he made it a great experience. The service is friendly and timely. Would recommend for anyone who wants good food and good prices, check out their late night happy hour!"}
{"text":"Had the Hawaiian roll, hand rolled tuna, Won Ton Soup, wife had Cucumber roll, teriaki chicken bowl, daughter had shrimp fried rice, Everything was very fresh and yummy! Service was excellent, place was clean and pleasant atmosphere! Prices were very reasonable. I will definately go again real soon."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and so happy we did! Great sushi! Service was fantastic! Even the kids loved it.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place three times, each time I had a great experience. I love the lasagna roll"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!  I will definitely be back to visit. Friendly service and delicious food! Loved the soft shell crab appetizer and the 5 rolls that we ordered."}
{"text":"Damn that was good! We brought our five kids in for an early dinner.  Super authentic, great customer service. Didn't balk at our brood which is a little nutty. Food was EXCELLENT! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am always up for sushi...  and Yummy always come through with fresh food and a great staff!"}
{"text":"Tried the toro tartar. I'd prefer that is wasn't as finely chopped but never the less...it was amazing. Very soft and almost like a coarse pudding. The presentation was beautiful.  Garlic albacore had a great sauce.  Can't wait until my next trip!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!!!!!! Very clean! Sushi was made as an art beautifully made. Will Def recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and great variety. The serving of live shrimp and lobster however is extremely cruel so I won't be back. It's a real shame as I thought I had found my new favourite restaurant. To think that de shelling and eating a lobster that is still moving is humane... I don't know why people are so cruel."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to see that the bar is extremely low for Las Vegas sushi. This sushi was alright, just not stellar. We ordered an avocado rolls, spicy tuna roll, two spicy tuna crunch rolls, and some special roll I can't remember the name of - perhaps a Green Dragon? Anyhow it was spicy tuna and avocado. Overall I felt as though the sushi was fine, well prepared and organized, and the waitstaff were polite. However, the tuna itself was not very delicious, I don't think it was particularly spicy, and the sauces used on some of the rolls were unusual - the spicy mayo tasted vaguely fruity, like mango or something?? In addition the crunchy spicy tuna roll was just a tuna roll with crunchy thrown on top of it, not a style I have seen in the past and not one I enjoyed. Overall everything was fine but not actually good.  The portions were generous. We over-ordered, so keep in mind that the rolls will most likely be bigger than you expect."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants I've been to -- not just in Las Vegas, but overall. The fish is some of the freshest I've been served, and the chefs often hook it up with more than we were expecting. Great service, too!"}
{"text":"What a find!  They have special fishes flown in from Japan and different places.  We were so lucky today that a fresh shipment arrived from Japan. Haven't had sayori in about 5 years since eating it in Japan so I was extremely happy to see that he had that today. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST sushi I've had in my whole life- and I'm old and have had a lot of sushi. I am so glad I ventured out of my Courtyard Marriott to try this place for lunch. It is delicious! I highly recommend it, especially the Tuna Karai if you like spicy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi in Vegas. Top quality seafood at very reasonable prices. Conveniently located in the northwest.   Tip-ask for some garlic sauce!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love he sushi hear, the yum yum sauce here is amazing and like no other. I would highly recommend this restaurant to other. Only wish they had all you can eat."}
{"text":"When I am craving Sushi and Udon at the same time this is the number 1 place that I am going. I am a customer for 7+ years and I still love this restaurant. Very good quality for sushi and Udon is even better than other Udon places. When I was prego, the owner made me custom roll since I couldn't eat raw fish and I truly appreciated it."}
{"text":"I had a nice time with my family on my birthday! Eel roll and Last samurai was awesome!"}
{"text":"We are a regular here. And we loo be their sushi. Decided to go there with our 4yr old son. Since their kids menu it's only 2 items we bought him pizza on the way. But when got there they told us we can't stay there even though they knew it was for a small kid .... very dispointing since I have spent a lot of money there....."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Yummy!  The staff is so friendly, the food is delicious, and we have fun each time we come here and sit at the sushi bar.  We found this spot on Yelp almost 2 years ago and have since become regulars.  Each time we visit, I find more amazing reasons to love this place:)"}
{"text":"Sucks!  SO SLOW,  I'm only here to get something for my daughter, I don't understand why she likes this place.  If you want real Sushi go to I Love Sushi"}
{"text":"Nothing compares to quality! Expensive but worth the penny's in this small joint. The staff there are wonderful..not all you can eat but too good to be true"}
{"text":"Very very good sushi. We had the screaming orgasm, sashimi salad, touchdown roll, California roll, tempura shrimp, and friend noodles with chicken added. Also the edamame which wasn't good but did not effect our overall meal. Service was great and all were very polite. Daughter burned her finger on the fried noodle plate and the waitress was very empathetic to her. Will definitely be returning!    Only real issue we had was a group of people who were talking about a political PAC which was extremely annoying and ruined the atmosphere. Couldn't wait to get away from them.   We definitely recommend this great gem of a restaurant to all who enjoy great food.   11/23/17 Came here on Thanksgiving...  very quite today but the items I ordered were awesome and full of flavor. I ordered and eel roll, salmon and tuna sashimi  yum!!!  Also got the two oysters and two other sashimi one was a trout and the other escapes my memory but was fantastic!!  The freshness was unbelievable."}
{"text":"Just got off the phone. Ordering delivery. She first asked for address to verify if it was in delivery range. Then tells me to hold... so I wait... and i wait...and i wait... then.. beep beep (dial tone). Hm... so it could just be a mistake.. so I call back. And say u hung up on me.... and in the middle of explaining my self she says you hung Up. It's ok. What was ur phone number again.. so I laughed it up and decided to order again.. I ordered a quite of few things but not all what I wanted. Because the girl has like a problem with me ordering food or something. And kept rushing me by saying anything else with a pity attitude.. I mean come on.. don't u want ur business to get as much sales as possible.? Why rush me? So I'm giving it two stars because I don't know how the food is. Or else it would be a 1 star. Get with the program hostess phone person.... sheesh..."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was fast & staff was friendly. The prices were not crazy expensive like some sushi places. I got the salmon hand roll, the spicy tuna hand roll, and the teriyaki chicken bowl all for under $12! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place on a whim. We walked in not knowing whether to seat ourselves or order at the counter. We asked the waitress/cashier/order runner and she seated us. We ordered drinks, veggie tempura and 3 rolls after reviewing their menu. I like that they have several shrimp tempura rolls which are my favorite. She brought our vegetable tempura and forgot the drinks. I had to remind her as she breezed past the table. Our rolls arrived shortly after. I wasn't really impressed with the presentation or the quality. Mind you, I am NOT a sushi snob. The rolls just seemed thrown together. Overall, I'd rather spend the same amount of money elsewhere that doesn't seem like fast-food sushi. Might be good for take-out orders. They seem fast paced and more concerned with answering phones and take-out orders than customers dining in."}
{"text":"When a sushi restaurant serves white pickled ginger that is the first sign that the quality is good. The sashimi was really fresh and the California rolls were really soft and flavorful. We also really liked the things they gave us \"on the house to try\"."}
{"text":"This sushi place is pretty much a Pan-Poly-Asian restaurant so there is something for everyone. Check it out... they serve Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian, etc.   We sometimes do strait up rolls, or go with the lettuce wraps and wor wonton soup. If you want something heartier there are plenty of meat, rice and potato salad combos.  You also have the convenience of calling in and pick up. We don't live in the delivery area, so picking up meals after errand running is super convenient.  When my daughter went to high school, I would pick up food here and drop it off. The food is well packed, no leaks. It was a great Friday treat for her."}
{"text":"Sushi chefs were kind and food tasted great. All fresh ingredients. I will be returning for my sushi! :D"}
{"text":"Fish so fresh,  so alive, I'm wondering,  how do they do it? I had an oyster trio, kumamoto,  hama hama, and miyagi; all sweet delishnes. I also had the orange clam from Japan prepared by the amazing James, it was utter perfection sweet and briney."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! My co-workers and I love having lunch here at least once a month. Their lunch specials are very reasonable in price and their portions are huge!!   The staff is super nice and the place is very clean, which are also a plus!"}
{"text":"If I could give less then 1 star I would, I've been a consistent consumer of yummy for years now, that being said, my most resent visits has seriously left a bad taste in my mouth, both physically, and metaphorically...I walked in at 9:30, with 2 friends to eat, I was denied sit down service from an employee who was reading a magazine, on his phone, clearly being lazy...after I bragged to my friends about this place, we walked out, me feeling like a jerk(thanks yummy)...I will never be back, or recommend your spot to anyone ever again"}
{"text":"I felt like I was going to go into a coma after our meal. With that being said, this is not a bad review the food was just so delicious and filling. I would recommend the dynamite appetizer. I think it's scallop, crab, smelt egg, with some kind of sauce. I don't remember exactly what was is in it but just get it if you want to have a foodgasm!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot!!! This place can compete with the high end Sushi places in town."}
{"text":"first off, there is nothing wrong with the service... the chef was very friendly.  I came here because I love trying exotic fish. I was going for the flying fish and they didn't have it.   I sincerely think the the price of the side dishes can be more humble - not to be critical but $5 for some seaweed salad I can get from the market was a little too pretentious."}
{"text":"Took the Yelper recommendation on this one. Absolutely some of the best sushi I've had in town yet, and I've had a lot of sushi!  The quaint little spot feels more intimate and had a good Friday night vibe.  The chefs made it a point to get to know you right away and for that, sake was shared all around!  The fresh fish of the day specials were amazing, as was the refreshing specialty roll menu.  Of course, they have the standard fare for those who have difficulty breaking out of their yum yum covered, imitation crab filled comfort zones. To top that off, they also carry Orion beer from Okinawa!  Nice change from the Sapporo and Asahi standard.  What really sets this place apart is the little touches, like ice-cold plates for the sushi, so everything remains cool and fresh.  And a happy staff that engage with the customers.  Definitely my new top spot for raw fish goodness!"}
{"text":"It was ok, but not great. I got the combo fried rice. It was pretty bland and all the meat was kind of dry & flavorless. I really wanted to like this place bc it's pretty convenient to my work. I might give it another try. Maybe it was an off night. If I have a better experience, I will update."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out since I drive past it on my daily commute. I finally did.  I called for a pick up order and the woman took my order no problem. Once I get to the place, I'm surrounded by waitresses all staring at me. The place is very tiny.  I pull out my debit card to pay and am told \"oh, no. Minimum ten dolla\". No one told me this over the phone. Who carries around cash nowadays ??? It's 2018. They should be sure to emphasis the minimum with all call in orders.  Needless to say I got my order and the portion was TINY for nearly $6 I expect a little more. I am 5'5\" and this was smaller than my hand. I ordered the seaweed salad, it was okay. Too much sweet sugary sauce on it, literally dripping off of it.   I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Location ok. Inside ok. Food ok. Service ok. Fatty tuna 2 pieces market price $19. The photos on yelp do not match the place. I wish them luck. Nice waiter but inexperienced, shy and not so knowledgeable. Also place is called Yummy but they have videos on their tv screens advertising Kame. It's confusing."}
{"text":"We ordered a few different rolls. The names of the rolls are hilarious and there is a huge selection so it took us awhile to decide on some good ones. My favorite was a Paradise roll with coconut shrimp and coconut flakes on top - definitely a different type of sushi! The other roll I loved was a Ryans Special ( I think?). The service was amazing! We ordered a baked roll, which took a little longer than expected and they gave us this yummy pancake thing as a appetizer! I would say the rolls are delish and the service here is even better!"}
{"text":"This is mine and my husbands favorite place, exceptional service and service as well as amazing food"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and service! 5 star rating. Highly recommended. First class service from the time you walk through the door."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite sushi spot and I can't believe it is in Vegas. Thank you to the chef for having spot on fresh sushi. I tried a variety of things and I couldn't be more impressed.   - mussel- so plump and juicy, the perfect mussel - echiwa ebi (hairy crab)- the meaty crab and subtle buttery taste was pure heaven - clam- loved the hint of seasme oil drizzled on it. It was super fresh. the sweet plum was a nice addition -conch- the texture was chewier and harder, I wasn't a huge fan favorite, but you may like it -large scallops- really fresh and mild tasting -silver salmon- soft and has a more subtle fish taste -regular salmon- buttery and melts in your mouth - live shrimp- tastes like it just jumped out of the ocean, crunch and light tasting  the sorbets were the perfect finish at the end of a delicious sushi dinner. Thank you Yummy Grill & Sushi for an amazing sushi experience."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Sad it's such a small location because I'm impatient when it comes to waiting! The Green Valley is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavorful food great pricing an excellent lunch special  Soshi bar chef on point They do get buzy and it is a tiny place but worth a try"}
{"text":"I was a princess here! I am never in this part of town and I went specifically to meet Yelp friends here :)  I went here with Rod L., Lindsey O. and Christie O. and we had a fabulous meal!!!!!! I finally got to use a check-in deal and dang it's a good one!  Wn treated me like a VIP! I explained no meat and no dairy. He made me two beautiful yummy rolls.  Christie is the true queen and since she is a regular, they really hooked us up!  The first roll was a huge futomaki type veggie roll and it was perfect! I have not had sushi forever and unless I make it at home to explain my veg only is normally a true nightmare lol.   The second roll was an avocado stuffed crispy roll. It was a cheat day and I knew I was craving something fried to go with all the alcohol we were about to consume.  The guys ate a few rolls and they looked awesome and pretty.  Wn and the chefs kept sending out apps and tiny bites and they always fixed me the veg version of it! HOW COOL!    I will def be back soon!!! I need another cheat day soon!"}
{"text":"BEST OMAKASE EVER ! Thanks to Chef Eric for accommodating us for so long (oh my god it took FOUR AND A HALF HOURS) ! ! ! First and BEST omakase experience ! Omakase is a show in itself. Watching Chef Eric work his magic and show his creativity in his dishes. max points on service !   Fresh Wasabi - made into a relish. Addicting! went well with a lot of dishes but also yummy to \"snack\" on while waiting in between dishes. produces a fast effect to the nasal passages. has a nice, sweet flavor.   #1 - Marinated Tuna on top of chopped Mountain Yam with Wasabi Tobiko  Saw Chef Eric chopping mountain yam. After chopping, the yam produced a \"slimy\" texture, similar to okra but crunchy like jicama. Yam itself was plain but paired with a marinated tuna balanced flavors very well. what a variety of textures  #2 - Deep Fried Gobo/Burdock Root with dipping sauce  Little chips. Fried perfectly. Very slight starchy texture but crispy overall. Lightly sweet. Great \"snack\" !   #3 - Fresh Santa Barbara Sea Conch with salt/pepper/sesame oil dipping sauce  Very fresh. Meat texture had a nice \"bite\" texture. LIGHTLY dipping the sliced conch in the sauce gives it a nice flavor. Salt helps brings out more sweetness of the conch meat  #4 - Fresh Hama Hama & Shigoku Oysters  One of my fears on eating raw oysters is they being not fresh, and not clean (resulting in biting into sand/shell/etc.) Two different sizes. Shigoku oysters were small and fat. Very clean and fresh. Gave a nice, creamy texture. Hama Hama oysters were much bigger, not as \"fat/thick\". Outer \"rim\" of the oyster, gave it a nice \"crispy/crunchy\" texture when eating.   #5 - Fresh Live Scallop w/ Dried Miso  Served two ways. The scallop itself was thinly sliced and sprinkled with dried miso and layered with slices of cucumber. The miso gave it a nice flavor on top of the fresh taste of the scallop. The muscle? was sliced and placed in the middle. Not chewy but gave a nice \"crispy/crunchy\" texture, similar to what you'd get from eating fresh geoduck sashimi   #6 - Takoyaki - Deep Fried Fresh Octopus Suction Cups  At first, i thought this was calamari. But was told it was the SUCTION CUPS of an octopus leg. Lightly battered and deep fried. Crispy batter. Suction cups itself was nice and \"crispy\"   #7 - Fresh Live Hokkaido Octopus Leg  This was definitely a surprise. Aside it from having a small spot of sriracha sauce on top that gave it a little kick... i did NOT expect the octopus to be so soft and tender. Granted i dont think i've had raw octopus, especially served like this but oh man !   #8 - Fresh Live Sweet Shrimp with Black Tobiko and Uni + Deep Fried Head  The head was deep fried. Fried pretty well. Most of it was edible, except some thicker, harder areas. The sweet shrimp itself was big. Meat texture was firm. Slightly naturally sweet.   #9 - Fresh Live Santa Barbara Sea Urchin topped with a raw Quail Egg & Ikura on a bed of mixed seaweed brown rice  LARGE & FAT (no joke !) pieces of sea urchin placed on top of the bed of mixed seaweed with brown rice (and other things) with a raw quail egg on top with some Ikura. The sea urchin was SUPER creamy. Mixing in the quail egg and ikura. Taking a small piece of the sea urchin and everything else. What a orchestra of flavors and textures. so delicious ! add a little fresh wasabi for even better experience !  i think this is less than $20 ala carte too ! what a deal, even normally !   #10 - Fresh Blue Fin Tuna/Chu-Toro/O-toro from Spain Nigiri Trio   Made into nigiri. Chef used his special homemade soy sauce on the tuna as well ! Best blue fin tuna i've ever eaten. Very slight metallic taste. Super tender and flavorful. Chu-toro was a perfect balance of meat and fat. Melts in your mouth. O-toro (was a little disappointing due to the pieces of chewy parts (tendons?) which req' the chef to slice and arrange it differently). Super fatty. Would have liked the chef to quickly torch the top to bring out the aroma and flavor of the fat even more.   #11 - Fresh Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna with Fried Onions  Sliced tuna. Add a few onions to the middle, on top of the sliced chili, wrap it around and enjoy. plethora of flavors on top of the nice sauce it was sitting in. Chili adds a little small kick to it all  #12 - Torch Seared Wagyu Beef with Uni, Ikura, and chopped Shallots  Super tender! Roll it around to \"encase\" the uni and ikura. Opposite side of beef still raw. variation of beef tataki.   #13 - Fresh Kohada (Spotted Sardine)   First time trying kohada ! always wanted to try ! strong flavor with a little sourness (similar to mackerel)   #14 - Fresh Australian Ocean Trout and New Zealand King Salmon  Trout tastes crisper, less fatty than salmon. Both orange meat. Simple and clean.   #15 - Fresh Blue Fin O-Toro Sashimi  THAT MARBLING ! Super tender. A5 Wagyu of the Sea.   #16 - Unagi topped with avocado and bonito flakes  Simple but delicious unagi nigiri  #17 - Green Tea Ice Cream  1st floral tasting and aromatic green tea EVER"}
{"text":"Went there on lunch special.  No customers there . Not busy but Food a little bit slow. Service was ok. Food was pretty good ."}
{"text":"I had the nemo roll and volcano roll. The nemo roll is really good. I wasnt a fan of the volcano roll. It was oversauced. With that said, service was a bit too overbearing and made us feel like we were being rushed. Overall, it was a-ok."}
{"text":"I got stuck for two hours getting my car serviced and decided to have a great sushi lunch, only to find out, that the sushi tender questioned repeatedly my right to have my service dog. I had to go all the way back into my car being serviced, to get my registration card and additional medical card for the guy. He obviously broke the law by Continuously questioning my right to have my service animal after I showed him everything. He proceeded to take pictures and call the owner to verify that validity of my documents. I seriously believe that after this incident that it is clear that there are many uneducated people, breaking the law and clearly continue to with the intention of keeping service animals out of restaurants. Please consider eating elsewhere as this is unacceptable. I still ate there and at least the busboy was very nice. If you love animals and federal rights being respected, show you care and stay away. Thanks"}
{"text":"they knew the name and origin of the three oysters on the menu. love that. they also have fresh softshell crab from Baltimore.  they just keep on impressing."}
{"text":"Where to begin??? To be honest, I don't know where to start to write a review with a good introduction, But straight to the point. This is the third time that we're been to this sushi joint, but it's never disappointed us. (Sorry, there are no duplicate food porn photo. Find out for yourself) We are here for Father's day. As many other guests, why are we keep coming back for another great time, because the owner aka sushi chef who took great pride in their work to provide exceptional service. Let's get down to the food. Every dish that we ordered was beautiful craft with delicious taste of freshness. From salmon skin salad, soft shell crab, or baked mussels are on point. I promised you that. It is a holiday, we know they are busy, but our chef took something a little personal to compliment every guest with rice cake and grilled hamachi, to me it is an appreciation. That's something none other restaurant out there offer. Arigato Eric San. We're always come here for nigiri (sushi) to taste the freshness texture of the fish, because they have the variety from fishes shipped in daily from different continents of the world. Make sure you enjoyed them with fresh wasabi (look at their pictures for proof). We're not stopped there of what's on the menu. Look out for that black board on the wall of the specials that they offered. It's not only something that the chef wanted you to try, but they want to represent their culture of the Japanese cuisine that they can offer you for an adventure.  Enough said, go experience for yourself. ?????"}
{"text":"Really bad food. Honestly the worst I've had in Vegas yet. Zero flavor. Very bland. Really disappointed. Save your money. I should've listened to the other reviews. Lol they didn't even give me silverware or chopsticks. I ordered through Grubhub because the lady on the phone flat out told me if she were me she would trust grubhub instead of ordering through them. I'm like mad I just took in those tasteless calories. Can't even finish it."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing everything is incredibly fresh and has tons of flavor the sushi chefs are super creative and talented it is a little pricy but so worth the money!"}
{"text":"In the 9 years and multiple sushi places I've been to- this little place is by far the best. Highest quality and BEST service- I love the people here!!! Hardcore regulars!!!"}
{"text":"I have never wanted to try sushi. Always thought I wouldn't like it and didn't want it anywhere near me...that having been said, the \"ryans special\", \"nemo\", \"spiderman\" rolls are all to DIE for. If you're a sushi enthusiast or a first timer, the sushi will amaze you. I only mention these three rolls because each time I go, I say \"i'll try something new today\" but these always end up on my table. they have such a wide variety of rolls, i'm certain that you'll find rolls to your liking. i can't say enough about this place. wife and i will usually order 3-4 rolls and spend $50-$60 including drinks (not alcohol) and tip."}
{"text":"I am devastated today! Until today Yummy was my favorite sushi in town. Several things went wrong and some were deal breakers. I think I won't be back. Firstly, the service was aweful. Our waitress, Nong, was off putting with a bad attitude. Also, the fish was not as fresh as usual. The food still tasted ok. As a matter of fact....the spider roll was as amazing as it has always been. But.....the entire time I dined the owner was sitting nearby with friends getting drunk and being loud and inappropriate. Lastly, there was hair hanging from an electrical fixture on the wall next to me and it was generally unclean. I am so disappointed. But....I guess this establishment has changed for the worst."}
{"text":"Been back five times, with family and business associates. Keeps getting better. Bluefin tuna and toro are life changing, but expensive. Staff is competent and friendly.  Have referred many colleagues to restaurant but best times are with my son, daughter and wife. The look on they're face after the meal is priceless."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this sushi place. I'm usually one of those people that are like \"baaah no AYCE?, then forget it!\" But Yummy Sushi Grill is totally worth it.   Every roll I've tried from them has been full of flavor and different spices.   I love their spicy rolls, the \"kiss of fire\" is one of my frequents, for non-spicy, I really like the ban ban roll.   My bf and I come to this place often because every roll is good, so you don't waste your $. And it's not like AYCE where if you decide you don't like the roll, you don't have to stuff your cheeks and run to the bathroom to spit it out :P"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and good regular prices! I esp love the freebie appetizers of cucumber and crab salad, onion pancakes, and  miso soup!"}
{"text":"Walked in 30 minutes to close... no attitude just a simple statement from our friendly host that last call is in 15 minutes.  We ordered. We ate. We drank. We were out by close. Just what we needed after a long day serving customers ourselves. Everything was better than we expected and we are happy to have found a great place nearby!  :) Thanks for accommodating us so late and for being delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have lived in the area for many years and never went in . I'm so glad we finally did ! This is our go to sushi spot now ."}
{"text":"Lunch special for $12.95 was awesome, I had spicy crab roll seaweed salad and spicy salmon awesome"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that any sushi place that has Orion beer from Okinawa and an Anglo making sushi can't be all bad.  The rolls are delicious and reasonably priced.  The chefs know their stuff and could make even taco taste good.  Try the salmon skin salad and the Toro sushi or sashimi.  And of course, the Orion beer."}
{"text":"It's an amazing place to eat sushi! Had the toro, live shrimp, giant clam, mackerel sushi, live squid and the rainbow spicy tuna roll. One of the best hole in the wall sushi restaurants. Fresh and actually one of the best sushi restaurants in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Added to our must go places in Vegas!  Excellent attention to detail and such pride in the work!  Next time we are trying their omakase restaurant located next door."}
{"text":"I used to come here at least once a week ! It's been a while and I was finally in that area. I ordered pickup . Paid, tipped, etc, no soy sauce, one of the two rolls I ordered didn't come with the sauce on top - or anywhere. It bums me out because I live to far to drive back and was super super excited. The rolls were good,  just maybe be sure to double check next times please !"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a great lunch. $13 for lunch and you get to pick three items from their lunch menu (miso soup is included.)  The service was great. Drinks were refilled without asking (had iced green tea.) got my food pretty quick. I sat at the bar and could see them making my roll.   I picked: Salmon sashimi Spicy tuna roll Spicy salmon bowl ( this was really good. It was like a spicy salmon poke over a bed of warm sushi rice)   Everything was so fresh. The salmon sashimi practically melts in your mouth!   We be back soon! Definitely Yummy Sushi!"}
{"text":"There lunch and dinner combinations come with so much food! And for such a cheap price. And usually you get what you pay for but not in this case. Everything is absolutely amazing. We have dined in and just got it for pick up so we can eat at home. When we ate there, there was the waitress who literally stood a few feet away the whole time. Drinks never got more then half way empty. After a bit it did get busy for dinner so she didn't stand right there obviously. My favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"High end quality is 5 stars, location is a minus. If you stick with the good stuff you'll be happy!  Rule 1. Don't be a cheap ass with sushi."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick bite during my lunch break. The sushi was fresh and rolls were very creative and delicious. The service was also good and I was able to get in and out quickly. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in Vegas!! Friendly staff and creative and delicious rolls. Ask for June's bluefin tuna roll, it is the best thing I've ever tasted!! (that's what she said)"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch values.   Recommend the Mongolian beef or chicken with fried rice.  Feed the whole family for $20."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Customer service is always great and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Very nice owner and staff with lots of free extras, extensive menu and overall very good but not exceptional."}
{"text":"This happy hour is a joke.  It may be half the price but they give you half a roll.  For example, spicy tuna was 6.5 for 8 pieces but the happy hour is $3 for four pieces.  The sushi wasn't bad, but I just came for a good happy hour.  Highly disappointed.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Tuesday at 12:30. Moderately crowded. 2 wait staff, 2 chefs. I waited 5 min to order and over 30 for my food to arrive :(  Wait gal was pleasant. I ordered 2 cut rolls and 2 Nigiri. Cut rolls weren't bad, although a little small for my liking. Nigiri Sake (salmon) and Toro salmon were tasty with the buttery flavor that I expect from salmon. Texture was firm. Hamachi was a little bland ... lacking the fatty richness I want from a fresh yellowtail. One salmon piece had 3 bones. All the Nigiri were small. Overall the fish was fresh with good  mouthfeel and bite."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi and sashimi.  Eric the owner made us feel so welcome and the food is excellent. You have to try pan shell, blue fin tuna, toro, and any specialties seasonal items. Highly recommended.   Always ask what's is today's special.  You'll love it.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Came after beer sampling with my hubby on a Saturday night, and this place was open late! I think we got there at 11pm! It also happened to be happy hour,which scored massive points to me. It wasnt busy at all, maybe two other groups and we were all at the sushi bar. We ordered Two rolls, miso soup, and it came with a neat little appetizer that was like little veggie cakes. Drank iced green tea,unfiltered, and it was delicious! Would definitely return,especially late night/happy hour!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this establishment for the last 2 1/2 years and every time I go I am never disappointed. The food is always great, the service is always great and you get more than enough food for what you pay for! I tried the wonton soup for the first time last night and couldn't believe how excellent it actually was. It was full of fresh vegetables and wontons. I have just found my new place to buy wonton soup. This place doesn't get enough props for how good it actually is so visit as much as you can!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else, most times I got for sushi it's all about the AYCE. My guy and I met up with some Yelp buddies here for dinner last night and I'd say that it's truly as good as everyone says. I thought there was only one thing it lacked- speedy service.   Fatty Tuna Sashimi (Toro): delicious! Absolutely melt in your mouth awesomeness.   Tempura Dinner: very tasty, tempura was exactly what you'd expect but in a larger portion. Miso soup was good, rice was dry but I didn't plan on eating it anyway. Salad was alright.   Yellowtail Nigiri: we had 2 orders (4 pieces) on the same plate. On our first couple pieces, the rice was very strong and wet. We waited a while and ate the other two, and the rice seemed drier and less intense. I don't know what happened here honestly.   Taste better than your ex-girlfriend roll: pretty good. A little too overpowering on the cream cheese end but the tuna inside was really good.   Yellowtail roll: very little fish inside. Mostly rice. A bit disappointing. Maybe try the handrolls next time?   I think Jason had ordered more food, but I can't recall. He's still looking to try the blue fin here so hopefully we get another opportunity soon.   Good quality, tasty fish. I just don't see us passing up AYCE at Yama every time to come here."}
{"text":"With the high reviews I really wanted to love this place. I did and I kept coming back hoping things would change with the customer service and wait time for food but it never did. See the end of my review for why.   The first time we came for happy hour and got huge slices of fish, very generous. We then went back again and this time the fish slices were literally cut in half the size it was the first time, service was sllllllooooowww and we had to ask for them to check on things, ask for water refills, but my main gripe was that the fish slice reduced in half. I would appreciate them keeping things fairly consistent if it's large slices or small, either way I know what I would get.   I do like the quality of the fish and so I would always try to convince my hubby to come back and each time I literally had to convince my husband that things would get better in terms of the wait time for food. Sometimes we just don't have 2 1/2 -3 hours to wait for our food.   We came here once on a major holiday and once on my birthday so that shows you how much I really liked their fish but I started to feel like I was just being hopeful by keep coming back, hoping things would get better. We also came about 5 other times.   The last visit was my most memorable in a bad way. We ordered tuna (regular) on the first order and had a conversation with our waitress and she told us how blue fin tuna was much better and we should get it. We said we would think about it. She said if you order all of our different types of tunas and have them side by side and compare taste you would notice the difference. We then later added in blue fin tuna (with a different waitress because ours was too busy to talk to us for about the 10 minutes we tried flagging her down). The regular tuna arrived at the table. We were hoping to get them together but after waiting and waiting we never got the blue fin, so we just ate that first tuna (regular).  More waiting and waiting and got some other orders, we got another plate of tuna. It looked exactly the same as the first. But what do we know, maybe it was different.  It tasted the same as the first. We were confused. We asked our waitress why it tasted exactly the same (when she claimed they tasted different) and she went to go check on it and after some long conversations with the sushi chef and waitresses she came back and said that I had ordered another order of regular tuna. I said no we ordered the blue fin tuna per your suggestion. We weren't impressed with the regular tuna and that is why we ordered the blue fin. She kept insisting that I ordered the regular and I kept insisting I did not, because that is true. This went on with her talking about it with Eric the sushi chef/Owner? and the 2 waitresses involved. It started to get uncomfortable for me watching it all. She then comes back and says if you want to order it, it's past the happy hour time but we can offer it at the happy hour price. Ummmm, no thanks. I already ordered it before (an hour ago), we are done eating, already spent over $100, and so over it at this point. Why not just bring us the correct tuna that I ordered??? Especially since they know us by face, Eric even came over and said he recognized us when I mentioned that we have been here many times.   It just upset me that they made such a BIG deal about it, instead of just giving me what I ordered, the waitress insisted I was WRONG and made it known, making for a really awkward \"date night\" with my husband. It was also the waitress that kept saying there is nothing she can do, it's not her restaurant and she is sorry but that is the decision. She kept apologizing for what happened, but like I said we were done eating and just ready to go, not wanting to argue over fish.   The owner could see us talking and he finally came over long after we had already been talking about this for an extended period of time which I just wanted wanted to drop it at this point. I expect more from a place with high reviews and wish he would have taken the matter into his hands from the start once he realized there was a problem. In the end he removed the second order of regular tuna and made it seem like he was accommodating us. It was the right thing to do, but we still never got the blue fin tuna we ordered. To each his own and he is the owner, if he feels this is how to treat regular customers, that is his choice. Unfortunately after coming here regularly for about a year, we decided that we want to feel a little more appreciated as customers. I think the problem could have been fixed quickly even if the waitress did not admit it was her fault instead of dragging it out and making for an uncomfortable dining out experience.   The fish is 4 stars (5 stars taste, 4 stars size of nigiri).  The customer service to me is 0 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place. The fish is fresh and delicious. The chef is so knowledgable about his fish and he's very willing to explain to us the different textures and tastes to look for. This place is truly a hidden gem.  Can't wait until the omakase place opens next door."}
{"text":"I was gonna try they Omakase but it's $160.   Since I am near by, I decided to try for lunch first.  Very disappointing actually.   I had no desire to take any pictures.  Even the miso soup is fairly bad.  I guess I am disappointed because my expectations were too high and the price is also on higher end here.  They even charge for weird green tea that's in brown color.   I don't see fresh wasabi or any special ingredients here.   Most of the stuff I wanted to order from the Yelp photos are not available."}
{"text":"Stranded in north Las Vegas, I went to this place simply based on Yelp reviews.  I loved this sushi so much that I signed up for an account just to praise it.  I've eaten at dozens of Yelp restaurants in LA, Boston, and New York, but none of them made me want to add a comment.  I'm from Orange County CA and had plenty of sushi.  This is my favorite so far.  Every time I come to Vegas I will be sure to go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Love the friendly welcome from the sushi chefs as you walk in.  Service was very friendly and attentive all throughout our meal.  The sushi chefs seem like they enjoy their work and chat it up with the customers.    High quality fresh affordable sushi.  Boy I wish they would do an AYCE, but I like the emphasize on the little details that highlighting the fresh fish and tempt your eyes and belly. You cannot get this quality with AYCE.  If they have TORO you must get it,  3 decent sized thick rectangles of melt in your mouth tuna for about 10 bucks...What is not to love?   Live Uni! Hello, LIVE UNI!   Why of course, I will have that!  Uni is served on a bed of rice with a nice quail egg and tobiko on top. It is to die for.  Again I don't really eat rice, but OK I will when it is under uni, quail egg and tobiko!  Ok if live uni does suit you, maybe live shrimp, or live clam, or live scallop?  Do it! Get something you never had before...this is the place and I guarantee you will be blown away. It was totally worth the $18.00 experience...they show you your uni and clean it up and design it into an artful edible pleasure...see  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?select=F8LPnzDPYUqPdEdDbaa_TQ#F8LPnzDPYUqPdEdDbaa_TQ  So yes the final bill hurts in comparison to AYCE, but wow what an amazing check in my bucket list. Eat here and eat ALL their specials!!! Can't wait to come back.  P.S. I would like to personally thank Kimberly T, a fellow Yelper for her awesome review  that had me saying, \"Hello\" to Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this place been coming here for years. Eric is the best and extremely knowledgeable. Young is fabulously too. Super high quality fish. My go to spot."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Vegas so far. They have a board telling you all their fresh fish for that day and everyone there is really friendly! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Dirty. Food was not terrible, but I can think of at least 10 better places in Las Vegas alone. If it's not a priority to keep a clean and presentable dining room, I don't even want to know what condition the kitchen and storage areas are in. Been here twice, and won't likely be back. The first time, service was really slow. This time it was ok, but only because I was 1 of 3 total customers, and the only one not sitting at the bar. Food was just mediocre both times, and not priced accordingly. The 2 servers had nothing to do before I showed up, and the place was still not being cleaned. Nothing is more unsettling while trying to eat raw fish in the desert than wondering if it was properly kept in the first place. It doesn't smell bad, and I never got sick after the first go-round, so there's that.. Try harder!"}
{"text":"Almost everything about this place is fantastic. The food is absolutely delightful. It's very fresh and the rice is cooked perfectly. The waitresses are very nice and the selection of food is great.  This rating could have been 5 stars, but unfortunately my boyfriend and I ordered 3 sushis and 4 rolls between us. The rolls arrived in an acceptable amount of time but the sushis took over an hour to get to our table. It was very good, but took way too long to get to us."}
{"text":"The sushi was exceptionally good.  The waitress told us where and when the fish came from.  They had two forms of eel and both were great.  Will go back again"}
{"text":"I've been a \"regular\" at this joint now for...5+ years. When I say regular, I mean that they are the only restaurant that delivers to my store that doesn't charge me a delivery charge (but you have to buy at least $20 worth of food).   For a fast food place Asian place, they are decent. I have never had a dish there that was horrible, but there are certain dishes that I don't need to have (and my life will still go on). I usually get the sushi here. For quick sushi, it's good. BUT for the sushi experts out there, who need their maguro flown in from Japan the morning of their sushi lunch.dinner, you might think it's not so great. I'm a \"purist\" and tend to get rolls that don't have all the bells and whistles and I've always been satisfied.   -During the cold season, i was a fan of their \"yummy soup.\" I add noodles for $1.50 and I can split this bowl of soup into three portions!   -Chow mein is yummy but a bit too greasy so I've only got this twice.   -Combination fried rice is yummy, but be aware, it's oily...so when I get this, I put a napkin on top of a plate, pour the rice on the plate and let some of the oil soak through.   -Kalbi is good, but I can sometimes tell it hasn't been marinated enough.   Usually they're quick to deliver...sometimes they get backed up and have told me the wait time is an hour. Back in the day, they didn't have a delivery minimum AND since we were in the same shopping center they used to give us a 10% off discount.   I will continue to be a regular here because I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"My go-to for sushi in the northwest area. Great fresh food and fine hot sake with service to match. Welcoming atmosphere and awesome happy hour: mon-fri 9pm-12am.   My favorite rolls:  Nemo (with cucumber)  Mexican Spider-Man Sweet Heart  Kanpai! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow listen up all traditional sushi fans I'm not talking about the american California roll eater..  I'm talking to the real deal sushi fans this place freakiiiinnnnn.. awesome!!!! 5 stars all the way blue fin tuna all the way!!!! I have found my sushi place in the desert!!! Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG the best sushi and sashimi I've ever had in my life. The staff is very friendly and made some great recommendations. The screaming orgasizm was awesome. A must try"}
{"text":"In a city where mediocre all you can eat sushi places serve forgettable bites of fish, its refreshing to see a place that actually knows and cares about the type and quality of fish they serve.  The plethora of fresh fish that you normally would not see at a sushi bar off the strip was amazing.  The live amaebi, live scallops, and fresh octopus was a delightful experience.  For sushi connoisseurs that appreciate quality nigiri over rolls covered in sauce, i really recommend the kinmedai and the kohada here. It reminded me of my years in Tokyo eating at Tsukiji.  Unfortunately they did not have blue fin tuna in stock because the quality was not up to their standards.  Just to hear that they send back sub standard fish is refreshing to hear.  Too many times have i seen awful qualities of fish being served to other patrons at other sushi bars.  I will definately return to taste the blue fin.  If you want a quality sushi experience I highly recommend Yummy Grill Sushi."}
{"text":"When I did a Take-Out Order here, I went inside, and the chick was so RUDE, she played it off.  Supposedly she KNEW my order, that she had to ask me what I ordered. Dummy. Thanks, a lot B***! LOL...I am never coming back here again. So unprofessional. BTW, the sushi is just alright. I've had better. Just for the customer service, they screwed up. I don't plan on coming back, or dining in. Not classy, at all."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly,  the restaurant is clean sna the foods good! I eat here pretty regularly and think it's great!"}
{"text":"Change your phone  number or talk to your employees about answering your phone.  Twice on different days the phone rang at least 7 times. The first time this happened I assumed they were just busy. Nope the place had one table full and they had their food ( I tried calling while I was in line at target probably 10 minutes before). That was probably a month and a half ago. TODAY around 5pm nobody picked up. Decided to eat somewhere else because of this.   Overall the food is pretty good. I have eaten here in the past when I was craving some Hawaiian or Japanese food."}
{"text":"In a city where style oftentimes trumps substance, hype transcends quality, and cash-rules-everything-aroud you, places like Yummy Sushi restore my faith in the fact that great food doesn't necessary come with a huge price tag.  It's a nice, no-frills, non-prententious, and always fresh,  sit-down spot that's perfect for a quick sushi fix.      My love affair with \"Yummy\" started early this year, when I was unknowingly presented with a complementary veggie pancake appetizer.  I'm kind of obsessed with Korean-style pancakes, and I love that they serve this instead of the usual fare (edamame) from other sushi restaurants.   Now, the pancake appetizer, in conjunction with a nice frosty Sapporo, always sets an auspicious tone for the rest of my meal to come.  Which brings me to my next point....  The fish!  They have a variety of specialty/fusion rolls (some of which have pretty amusing names..).   To be honest, I have yet to come across a roll that I don't like.  They're all delicious, fresh, and melt in your mouth!   I practically have to fight my boyfriend for the last piece every time.  They also have specials during lunch (who doesn't love lunch specials?!).  Their teriyaki beef is really good,  and I usually don't ever order teriyaki. Great service too.  Some of the more complex rolls are a bit pricey (still very affordable though).  However, you have to pay for good quality, and for as many times as I've been here,  the quality of the fish is always great.  This will be one of my go-to sushi spots when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ambience was okay for a sushi place. You can see the Chef as soon as you walk in so that's a plus.  The severs need to work on service. Not pleased with the service. They had 2 servers with 3 tables at most. Also went 30 min without water. Asking for things was never done.   Not too loud but you can hear the music of the cooks in the back. Sorry if i want to hear shake your butt i would be at a club. Not a sushi place.  Well i will not be coming here again. I would have given half star if possible. Food never came out that was ordered. Orders was not brought out even after server verified the order before she left the table.  Bad birthday experince for my father.  The sushi isn't even worth it have a lot of better places for sushi. The one good thing here is the fresh uni.  It was not even busy today and they had 2 servers.  Not worth the money and time."}
{"text":"Fresh fish flown in, delicious, interesting options, fun and lively staff, lotsa regulars -like family when we go there. Only place we go for sushi in Vegas. Eric the owner is knowledgeable about the types and origins of fish-he sources everything, and will not skimp -customer satisfaction comes first with him. He is a perfectionist and we trust in him ultimately to serve the freshest, best \"in season\" fish avail."}
{"text":"it's official. this is my first review of a restaurant on yelp. i've waited until i've eaten food that was worthy of it, and finally I have. Yummy Sushi just slayed it last night with their 21 piece sashimi plate, and even more impressively their spicy bluefin tuna roll. the fish tastes as fresh as it gets, supplemented with a beautiful edge of acidity from the sashimi sitting on various slices of fruit (lemon / lime). it was an excellent array of fish (a couple I have never had before, and names that completely escape me), and it was a selection that needed to be savored. after finishing the sashimi, I was looking for some dessert. just so happens they had that spicy bluefin tuna roll that sounded perfect. wow. i mean, I can't wait to go back and get another take at it. flavors abundant, and topped off with tempura fried onion, plated over a sauce that brought both sweet and salty. absolutely fantastic in a whole. all of this was paired with Bride of the Fox sake, which was light and dry, with subtle tasting notes of cacao. service was solid and attentive, sushi chefs additionally were checking in on the flavors and satisfaction. i do wish they had a bit more ambiance with their bright lighting (perhaps a dimmer switch), but other than that no complaints. thanks Yummy for bringing your A game. i look forward to the omakase one of these days coming up."}
{"text":"Don't order the lobster sashimi which was plain and overpriced.  Sushi rolls were just ok as was the poor service.   Never coming back."}
{"text":"Just ok. No ayce & The server was not very friendly. When I asked her for a Different flavor sake she said I already opened it. I don't mind and I understand but it was her tone of voice. Also I have a 3 week old child, then another three-year-old my husband and I thought it would be a good idea to have the check ready after we ordered our food so I asked her nicely and she never brought it and then I asked her again and she said do you want it right now and I said oh in a few minutes it's fine she never came back so I had to ask for a third time for that check. Also my appetizer came out with my entrées it should have came out first. She never came around to check on us if we needed drinks or anything else, and didn't fill My water cup not even once...The food was good but I did not like my experience with her. There is also no changing table in the bathroom I had to change my baby on my changing pad on their sink :/ challenging. So when we got the check and it was pretty high for that type of service I pulled aside another server or maybe he was a Buser he is Latino very nice guy. I asked him for the manager but they were not available so I explained to him what happened he apologized and gave us 20% off. I was thankful for that. I did forget my to go box though :/"}
{"text":"This is not the place to get rolls. Discovered that the hard way, despite reading so many reviews here that focused on the fresh nigiri and sashimi. I'll have to come back for the positive experience.  Ordered take out using their website menu: seaweed salad, cherry blossom roll, paradise roll. Didn't see many rolls with salmon, and many contained tempura. Made my selection difficult, but they get a lot of reviews praising their rolls, so I figured I was safe.  Inside of restaurant is kind of divey with a large bar, which I like. Service was polite and friendly from the ladies at the counter. Three sushi chefs were present and busy when I was picking up.  Got home to the messy cherry blossom roll. Confession: I love sushi, but I've never had a round roll like this. Verdict: not my thing. Too reminiscent of crab salad and avocado from a country club or buffet, little to no similarity to sushi. Wish this had been noted more clearly on the menu. Or at all. t was the Paradise roll, which sounded adventurous. In my haste to find a roll with salmon, I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the fact that there was tempura shrimp AND (way too much) cream cheese AND (sweet) coconut in this roll. Verdict: again, not my thing. Very sweet and creamy roll, bearing little to no similarity to sushi. The sweetness and the cheese covered up any fish taste. Seaweed salad was flavored appropriately but dismally small: whoever packed my order accidentally put the salad in the lid rather than the bottom of the container, and space was limited.  Disappointed to have a negative experience at a place so many friends and Elites love and have reviewed favorably.  Overall, the rolls themselves are TOO Americanized, to the point that proportions of flavors are off and they're no longer sushi. I'll have to revisit and order exclusively off the fresh sashimi and nigiri specials next time for a separate review."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I've known and for a very good prices.  I have been there a lot of times, during regular hours, happy hours and even next door (same owner but fancy $200 omakase).  I have to say the Happy Hours are the best!  The good quality is the same but the price is half off.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Been on a hunt for a good sushi place to compare to the one back home! A co worker told me about yummy sushi.. Tried it and got hooked! It's a small Place, but the prices and the people and food is awesome! I can say I found my new fave spot for sushi in Vegas ;)"}
{"text":"Unlike most places in Vegas, this one does NOT offer an all you can eat. However, regardless, it is one of my preferred places to go. The fish is always fresh and the rolls are delicious.   Two caveats:  1. Since there is no all you can eat option, you will run up a tap, especially if you are drinking and/or hungry or if you are into more exotic items.  2. Service can be slow. The chefs focus on preparing each roll with care (rather than simply stamping them out). This means the rolls are tastier, but take longer to make. If you are hungry- grab a kitchen appetizer or come in during off- peak times.  All in I would confidently recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I need lunch on the go. Cost effective pricing, the food is good, friendly staff. Hassle free ordering. You can call in your pick up orders which is super convenient for someone like me who has no time to sit down. Also is in the same complex as a boba cafe which is a plus :)"}
{"text":"always enjoy the sushi AND service at yummy sushi! sooooo good! i heart yummy sushi!!"}
{"text":"One star for service. They were pretty in top.of it. One star for the price. Lunch special gives a very decent amount at a great price. One star for atmosphere. It's nice and relaxed, Contemporary Japanese music.  Two stars for the food. The spicy tuna was just right. Miso soup was VERY nicely done  (I'm very picky about miso). The salad dressing was light and crisp. Everything was hreat, I will definitely be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Hot damn!  Sushi places have always been for me a measure of better or worse of fundamentally the same tastes.  But this place... this place offered flavors that I have never experienced before, and I don't know how to describe them, but they were incredible.  And the presentations were works of art.  My wife's vegetable roll had four distinct textures.  It was outstanding because of how it felt!    I had live shrimp for the fist time.  For those of you who don't know, it's live until they fry the head in tempura batter and serve you the tail raw.  Now, I don't know what was in that dipping sauce, but when I tasted it from the serving bowl, it knocked my socks off, like sipping vinegar only smooth and addicting with a flavor that soaks the inside of your head and makes you screw your eyes up as acidic things do.    This is a true five-star place, without reservation."}
{"text":"Love this place for their quality and fresh cuts of fish. Some of the best sashimi and sushi in town. They also offer great lunch deals. Looking for live uni, shrimp, lobster, etc. then you will like it here."}
{"text":"I like the fast service and its a real quaint place that you would never think to do well amidst a lot of bigger stores around. I like the friendly vibe and I see how customers befriend the person sitting next to them at a bar even as strangers. Food wise, I can tell its quality and I can't complain that the service was fast and great. If I want a quick quality eat on a Friday night, this is the place."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple friends of mine the other night. We ordered a ton of stuff. The coconut shrimp is awesome. Very sweet tasting, don't even need the little sauce it comes with. It was pretty busy and the wait staff was movin around the best they could. Took some time to get our order in but mostly because of other needy customers. Once it quieted down for a sec, they were very attentive. Food came out in waves which is great since it gave as all time to talk and make room for the next bit of stuff we ordered. I would have to say the best thing I tried there was the nigiri. The fish melted like butter in my mouth when I ate it. The best I've ever had. In the end, they knew it was a friends birthday so they brought out ice cream and sang to him, it was awesome. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I base this review solely on the bento and other dishes.  I dont like to review sushi because I am very picky and its not fair.   This place had \"grill\" in the name so i thought they might care about more than mass sushi but then again, they had two business names at the same address. Not sure how that works.   On to the food.. the box was advertised as teriyaki beef.  It turned out to be a very small portion of bulgoki with burnt teriyaki sauce poured over it. The burnt teriyaki sauce was hard to handle but at least it was dialuted by the horrible salad dressing they over poured on my tray making it more of a bento soup kinda thing.  korean owned and operated japanese resteraunt is the norm but cheese pajun? Really? Sesame oil and red pepper flake for dipping Kaarage? No thanks.   BTW, green tea isnt served in a coffee cup but i guess thats what I get it after asking for a pot of tea three times. You also don't used julienned cucumbers for KappaMaki. People order cucumber because they enjoy them and want to taste and have some crunch.    The sushi rice is way to wet. If I pick up sushi and wet rice stays on the plate, then you are over doing it.   Lastly, if a resteraunt cant do items on the menu then they should  take them off or advertise them as daily.  I drove here because they advertised Hamachi Kama as an appearizer and then to not even have it at all. That was the only reason I came here. If they atleast had it I would have not left a review at all."}
{"text":"Eric, I don't remember what time but I appreciate the feedback. I will surely give it another try when I'm around the area.    Take care. -mike"}
{"text":"Nice service, great miso soup... nice quality fish.  I also ordered the combination box and the chicken was flavorful.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I wish I had a bigger belly to stuff more of their delicious hand crafted sushi in. The chef is super fun and has the best personality ever and their rolls are fresh. The sashimi tasted super fresh and so did the oysters!  Def going back"}
{"text":"My first time trying raw sushi! The tovar special was epic! Best sushi experience ever and Eric is very entertaining."}
{"text":"My Cousins are locals and come here all the time.  They can't get enough of Chef Eric. My Cousin from Canada came to visit so this was a great opportunity for all of us to see how special this place really is. Let's start off by saying Wow! I was blown away by everything. Since we had a bigger party, I got to taste a little bit of everything. All the specialty  rolls came out delish. I've tried many different sushi restaurants and I have to Yummy Grill & sushi is in my top 2. I will definitely be back.  Tip: sit at the sushi bar for great entertainment. Make reservations in advanced. Place is limited sitting."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and gotta say this is the best sushi in Vegas so far!  I really liked the TNT roll with sriracha on top.  We also had yellow tail and toro sushi and Japanese red snapper (kinmedai) sashimi all very fresh and good quality.  Had the caterpillar roll which is eel and avocado, nice and the sex on the beach which was good but not my favorite just wanted to try it as I have seen it on lots of sushi menus.  We spent a bit more than we usually do but it was well worth it for the better quality.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"If it's a holiday there's no lunch special.  We came here under the impression there's lunch.  Very disappointed!  I got the chicken teriyaki combo $13 and my kid the bulgoi (was not fresh) combo $15.   My kid loves Korean food and she had Bulgoi many times so she and I know how it should taste. when I told the server that it wasn't fresh she said they received shipment on Friday and it was marinated on Friday.  We ordered this on Monday, 3 days later.   This is the first time we came here for lunch.   We ordered the two combos and the server bought out ONE miso soup and I had to tell her twice that we ordered 2 combos=2 miso soups.  Additionally  The server bought out the food and I had to request twice for something to drink.   It was not busy at all.  There are two ladies by the sushi bar and we were the one table sitting down with two servers working.   I don't know how to reply back to the owners comment below.   Sorry I didn't give you a good review but I LOVE Japanese food and was craving for it.   So I was very disappointed and very sad when I walked out."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Great food, great prices (especially the happy hour menu), and great service.The food came out very quickly and I was visited on a Friday night. The server was very attentive to refilling our drink orders and the chefs were all legit!! This was one of my best sushi experiences"}
{"text":"The Best Sashimi in Las Vegas! This is where all the sushi chefs on the overpriced  strip come to get hard to get fresh sashimi"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of sushi; however, I'm not a huge fan of how much sushi costs. When I come here, prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount of sushi you're getting.   The quality of this sushi isn't exactly \"top-notch,\" but it's definitely better than so many other places in town. I LOVE the 911 roll and tiger roll here.   The service is always fast and efficient. My only complaint is that the seating inside is limited, but overall, fantastic sushi and service at a great price."}
{"text":"We ate at Yummy's for the first time last night.  So far, it's the best Sushi I've had in Las Vegas (although I haven't eaten on the Strip).  It was very busy but the chefs did a great job serving us anyway.   The Cajun albacore was amazing!   Everything else was great too.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Over price and rude. I ordered 10orders of toro sushi but they almost chopped all the toros and said to me 'I thought long piece of toro is hard to eat so our chef cut it half'. Whaaat? Have I asked you guys to cut half of sushi? Then why I order for SUSHI? And it wasn't cut it half. They chopped all of my toros. And they charged over price for chirashi too. I will Not coming this horrible restaurant again. forever."}
{"text":"I've been to Yummy sushi three times.  The first time was because it was a holiday and btw, they do not honor any specials or anything like that on holidays.  Full price.  Okay, fine.  Duly noted - it's a bait and switch on holidays, since you're limited on options since everything is closed, we are going to gouge you. Cool.  The second time was with a friend and we sat at the sushi bar.  I spoke some Korean and Japanese to the staff, which was fun buuuut hot tea and water took forever to get refilled.  Our edamame took FOREVER and took longer than our sushi!   So now the most recent time, and the reason for this review:  I went in with a friend.  We had a very polite, professional young man who was our server.  I recommended the place to my friend because we were tight on time and I consider the sushi at Yummy Sushi to be good for AMERICAN sushi restaurants. (Although a few places closer to Spring Mountain are a step up - but anyway...)  We sit, order drinks, and I notice there is a check in feature - XX amount of money off of a purchase of a certain amount or more.  I turn to the server and joke that, \"I doubt we'll hit this, but I\"ll keep it in mind.\"  He laughs nervously and goes to the back to check on the discount.  Apologetically, he comes back and states: \"I'm sorry, but we don't honor it any more.  Something that has to do with Yelp not taking it down despite the fact that we've asked them.\"   Me: \"Oh.  Okay.  That's strange, I've never heard of that, but it's cool.  Him: \"I feel bad, though, let me go check again.\"  So he goes back and asked the owner AGAIN.    So here's my issue: At this point, the owner should have come out and apologized HIMSELF. Not the waiter, who was doing his best to try and deal with the curveball.  To clarify: I wasn't counting on this check in offer as I stated I didn't think we would be hitting the minimum for it, but I don't like how it was handled at all.  That's an awkward situation that the server should have not had to deal with, especially since it was his first time with that.    But here's my BIGGER issue and why I gave this place two stars:  We let that go and order.  Sushi is fine.  Nothing incredible, just good standard sushi.   While we are eating, I'm listening to one of the sushi chefs go off to a customer - ranting about ANOTHER customer.  In the middle of the restaurant.  About fifteen feet away from us, (So this could be heard by others in there.)  He was standing in front of the sushi bar, going on and on about a vegetarian who came in and asked if they could do vegetarian rolls and he was mocking her.  Okay, yes, going to a Sushi restaurant and asking for Vegetarian Sushi is extremely limited.  But openly complaining about your customers in the middle of the restaurant?? So unprofessional.  Not cool.  Very disappointed in this."}
{"text":"Very good service the place is small so they. Making sure everything is ok prices are reasonable complementary food ...my first time coming and I will be back"}
{"text":"Been here multiple occasions and never neen disappointed. Great service, excellent chef's, servers are on point. These guys dont miss a beat. The owner even comes out and talks with customers and explains where and how he orders in his fresh fish daily for specials. I will continue to be a satisfied customer as long as they keep it up."}
{"text":"This place is actually very yummy super fresh sushi with great ingredients made in front of you.  I would really like they had the all you can eat especial but they still special to me."}
{"text":"This place is definitely in my top 10 sushi places in America.  The fish is always fresh, the staff is fantastically friendly, and they have a great assortment of delicacy-dishes that you're not going to find at most joints in the desert. (Example: Japanese Uni, live hairy crab, kawahagi, etc...)  Love this place. Been here about half a dozen times and I'm never disappointed.  They're an example of how a proper restaurant (sushi or otherwise) should be."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour yesterday with a friend and wow!   Items ordered:  -Cucumber salad; soy sauce & sesame seeds ($2.50) -Baked California roll; crab, avocado, yum yum sauce ($3)  -Japanese Lasagna Roll; crab, cream cheese, avocado, yum yum & eel sauce ($4.50)  I wasn't very hungry since I had already eaten, but since I had never tried Yummy's, I figured I could make a little bit of room in my belly. The cucumber salad had a different taste than what I'm used to but it was still good, the salad does not come with crab automatically, you have to ask for some, so I will remember that for next time. There is an additional charge ($5) for crab or shrimp, whichever you'd prefer. The rolls were both very good. I'm also not really a fan of baked rolls but these were good, specially the Japanese lasagna. I'm not really a big fan of having cream cheese in rolls since most places tend to make the cream cheese taste too overpowering, but not here, the balance was perfect!   The restaurant itself is on the small side, but not uncomfortable small. The waiters were all very nice and friendly. Service was quick, we were in and out in 30 minutes. Now I wish they were closer to me, but the drive from the southwest side of town wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I love going here. I haven't been here for a while but I just wanted everyone to know they are amazing. I always take my friends and family here."}
{"text":"First off let me say I am a HUGE sushi fan. My addiction needs to be fed at least once a week. I've always had really good sushi but never have I had sushi so good, I'm laying in bed still thinking about it until I tried Yummy Sushi. Wow!!!  The staff is unbelievably friendly and attentive (my water glass was never empty and that says a lot because most places ignore an empty water glass)  All the fish is amazing and so fresh it melts in your mouth. Try the toro. It will change your life.   Baked California roll is delicious too  Besides the perfect tender fish, they make their own soy sauce.   This place puts every sushi place I've ever been to to shame!!!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"If there was an award for the best delivery/ fast food sushi, this would be it. Located in a weird corner of the Target shopping center in silverado Ranch this place would get it. Whatever your in the mood for Yummy has. I got take out lunch the other day and got a few of their special rolls, some egg drop soup and some mochi ice cream. They have 37 specials!! If sushi isn't on someones wish list then they have fantastic teriyaki bowls also.  They have a special of 99 cent Nigiri sushi that is so great! I called my order in and picked it up 15 minutes later! If you live 3 miles or closer they will deliver to you!!  For an inexpensive take out place, it really delivers quality sushi at a great price and a clean dining room if you can't wait until you get home to chow down! I recommend this place for a quick bite any day!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here we're happy we did! My favorite things to order are the spicy garlic edamame and the Tomo Devil roll. We've been coming here for 8 years and never had a bad experience. Thank you Eric and team!"}
{"text":"Randomly chose this place while getting tea at Sheffield. I was very impressed! At first I was a little skeptical because it's a very plain looking restaurant and their menu is so large. They have plate lunches, sushi, ramen, chinese dishes and sandwiches.  I was going to get the meat jun but decided to get a sushi roll (#21 Rainbow tempura.) It was fresh, clean and delicious!  Very affordable prices. Most items are under $10.00 I will definitely come back. I think they have 4 or 5 tables and 6 bar seats... they may also have some outdoor seating.  They are across the parking lot from Target so lots to do in the area."}
{"text":"The food was only okay, and it took a half hour to get a philly roll. That's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Use to be good but last 5 deliveries horrible messed up orders and rolls just fell apart. Totally lost a customer"}
{"text":"My last visit definitely was 5 stars!   This place is my always go to sushi place whenever I come into town to see my boyfriend. It's really our favorite!   I've only eaten their nigiri here and you won't be disappointed! They many specials on the board that can you can try.   I love their happy hour also! Everyday from 10 pm to close. They have a great endless amounts of nigiri to chose from on there.   When you come you should always sit at the bar! The chefs are very nice and always answers my questions. Don't forget to take shots with them also!   Can't wait to try kame next door!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but this place was superb. I checked in and received a large sake, service was fantastic and food was great. I'm glad that we ventured off the strip for this. Will keep this place in mind for my future Vegas trips, which will be many."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here whenever we are in the mood for sushi.  We even commute and take VIP clients here, it is that good.  The fish is ordered regionally and the owner tracks schools of fish all over the oceans to make sure it is as fresh as possible.  The quality cannot be beat.  Specifically, the super white tuna and Cajun albacore are must-orders for me.  I have been playing with their rolls which tend more towards traditional ones with a few creative off-shoots for the adventurous sushi goer.  Even the non-sushi options on the menu are great and you should feel comfortable to bring someone who doesn't enjoy sushi here.  The tempura, teriyaki and other typical Japanese items are high quality.    This is not an AYCE spot.  The fish is high quality and not for the mass-ordering crowd that comes with AYCE.   Even as I write this review, the owner came up to us to make sure everything is great before bussing our table and sweeping the restaurant.  It is that care and attention to details that I love so much about Yummy sushi.  Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"my favorite sushi bar in las vegas Eric the owner is fun and always treat us good. do not expect a quick meal, everything is always fresh and Eric will explain any fish if you haven't tried it before"}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar and it was lunch on a Saturday so of course, it was busy. The whole meal took about an hour and some change, but we weren't in a hurry.  The chefs were nice and they told us about different specials, this place was not an AYCE, so they made food carefully and artistically. The toro was very good.  I like how it was scored and a light layer of soy sauce was on it. The other nigiri we ordered (mirugai and tako,) also had wasabi in it, so if you don't like that-tell them that when ordering.  The tempura was very good and so were the sushi rolls. I think this is one of the best a la carte places we've ever been to."}
{"text":"Chef WIlliam was amazing! He is very knowledgeable. The quality is out of this world. I would recommend the chef's choice. You will be amazed! We thoroughly enjoyed everything we had and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sushi was just ok. I agree with other reviews that the spam hand roll is a good deal for $0.99! Their tamago/egg hand roll also same price and was pretty yummy. My husband go the combination BBQ and found that the chicken was way better than the beef BBQ. Get the chicken! Spicy tuna and unagi was pretty good. Will be back & maybe next time I'll use their delivery service :)"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! I ordered the Romeo and a taste like your ex girlfriend roll to go and while I was waiting, the nice waitress gave us complimentary pancakes. The The only thing that got deducted one star is the fried shrimp on the ex roll. It was cold. Highly recommend though! The customer service here is always welcoming and very friendly!!"}
{"text":"First time actually going out to eat at a sushi place,  so far my experience has been ou this buffet has california rolls i think i'll have a couple  LOVED IT, it was special because it was my girlfriends birthday but im surprised i could eat the food enjoyably!  ordered a couple different rolls and the staff was very welcoming towards me not knowing how to order or anything, free appetizers were cool, we came in 30 min before closing but we weren't rushed at all.  very satisfied and would return over and over, maybe someday i'll try another sushi bar  but for now its yummy :P 4/5 for a great 1st time  ps ive never seen how to make sushi so i like how they make it right in front of you at the bar :D  Edit: Went a second time and they remembered us, they have what look like fish bowls on the bar that were empty, we put 5 or six ones in there to get the tipping started!!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food is quite good but they've officially lost a once loyal customer!  They obviously don't value their customers and that is unacceptable in the service industry.  On a $100+ bill, the $6.50 is more important to them than the customer telling them that one of the items was bitter and distasteful. Sad that the money is more important than if the customer continued to consume something bad and ultimately getting food poisoning?  Can't understand the managers decision to not adjust the bill. Bad business!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here for lunch, and we were fairly happy with what we ordered. Decent service, the food was good, though nothing out of the ordinary that really stood out for us. The vibe we got was a mall like atmosphere with reasonably priced food. If you're just looking for a quick bite in a casual environment, this place isn't bad."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lunch has perfect amount with variety. It wasn't too busy at dinner time, but excellent food as always. I haven't tried their happy hour, but that will be the next!"}
{"text":"The customer service SUCKS!!! They won't cater if you are allergic. Honey walnut chicken is the same as honey walnut shrimp, just switch out the meats. But the cook said NO as if it's that hard to do. Give me a break. Don't waste your money here  since they don't care about customers."}
{"text":"I love this place especially during Happy Hour. Great value. Amazing food. Friendly staff. The place is a bit small though, but definitely one of those places you need to check out."}
{"text":"I've had take-out lunch here twice and I really want to go in for a proper sushi-sampling meal, but I have high hopes from what my experiences have been so far.  The first time I ordered lunch from here my friend from work came with me to pick it up.  It wasn't quite ready yet, so they offered us a seat at the sushi bar to wait.  They brought out water and complimentary korokke (Japanese Croquette; fried potato cake), which the absolutely did NOT have to do!  And let me tell you, their korokke is delicious.  I'm drooling a little as I type.  We finished up the korokke just as our ordered was presented to us.  Huzzah!  Took it back to the office, opened it up and there was a SUPER CUTE picture of edamame drawn on the edamame box.  OK so I'm a sucker for kawaii things.  But it was really nice of them.  The food...oh man, the food.  Everything was great.  The salad was crisp with a robust Japanese dressing, the miso soup was perfectly seasoned and accompanied by well-textured tofu cubes and the California Roll... albeit not \"real\" sushi, was mighty tasty and had very, very fresh avocado.  The first lunch I tried the chicken katsu - the breading is spot-on.  Their tonkatsu sauce is full-bodied with all the right flavors, so the two paired together make it heavenly.  The second lunch I had the teriyaki eel - also very, very delicious; dare I say it... Yummy.  Staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is just too cute with its cozy feeling and traditional Japanese decor.  May not be great for large parties, but will always be great in my heart."}
{"text":"We usually come here about twice a month. The service will forever be HORRIBLE but their food is good. For the first time ever we tried to order from their LUNCH MENU which is ANY chicken/beef/shrimp item. I don't know if ANY means something different in another language but in ENGLISH it means all options should be considered.   So as me and my fiancé both go to place our order we are told that we can only choose from a specific category. Well that's FALSE advertisement. I'm sure they could careless on the quality of their service since their food makes up for it. I just think it's sad that places with good food can't find good service. It would be so much more profitable if they could provide good food and good service.   Oh Roll 2, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Meat Jun, are some of our favorites here. I gave them 3 stars for the food. It's still a place worth coming back to just be ready for the lack of service they provide."}
{"text":"Hubby took me here for a quick birthday surprise dinner tonight.  He told me he wanted to find a non AYCE sushi place and decided to yelp for such places....great find and thanks, yelpers!  We shared the jalapeno pepper tempura, toro sashimi, TNT roll (spicy salmon and tuna), and Hawaiian roll (tuna).  All were fresh and flavourful.  Our server was delightful and chatty and we were very pleased with the quality of the food and the \"comfy-ness\" of the interior.  The restaurant is small and consists of a little bar area in the front and a dozen (?) or so small square tables in a row extending away from the bar.  Presentation of the sushi is very pretty (see photos) and reflects the care the chef takes with his craft.  When can I go again?  :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place to order take-out or delivery. They include all of the sauces separately so your sushi isn't soggy by the time you eat. They also always include soy, ginger and wasabi. Their rolls are decently priced and I've always been happy with everything I've ordered!"}
{"text":"Definitely will be back. The assortment is amazing, the staff friendly and accommodating, the food fresh, the prices reasonable. What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Small place, with lots of regulars.. the fish is so fresh, these guys really know what they are doing!  Beautiful rolls,  fast, friendly, knowledgeable service. If you haven't tried yummy sushi yet, do your self a favor, try something new and walk through their door..."}
{"text":"Everything is pretty delicious and fresh here and the presentation is very nice. Service was good and the price was decent. Went for the AYCE buffet the last few times and we weren't disappointed. Once of your favorite places. We will definitely come back. Can't wait to go back to Las Vegas to satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, greeted by multiple workers and chefs upon arrival, they were very friendly and service was on point. They have great lunch specials and everything seemed so fresh I don't eat fish but the chicken bowl I got was excellent .  My friend got the sushi and he said it was very fresh and on point. Keep up the good work, food and service"}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it. I ate 30 dollars in sushi to myself ! How sad, but so worth it."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant on a recommendation from a friend.  Small, typical strip-mall location didn't bother me (I've found some of the best places tucked obscurely away) but they left the door wide ajar (for fresh air?) and someone nearby was smoking a cigar, so it wafted in. Odd they didn't notice and shut the door.    Sat the the sushi bar, no greeting was called as you usually get, but no big deal.  Ordered a large hot sake for now and a beer with my meal.  This confused the hell out of the waitress, who couldn't fathom how to make that work.  When she brought the sake, she asked again if I wanted the beer now, so I said okay to help her out.  The sake was tepid, not hot, and not full.    Usually I order as I go but the sushi chef had no interaction with me other than to hand over the welcome plate with ginger, wasabi, and a small cuke taster (nice).  So I resigned to pick everything from the paper sheet, and the happy hour thing was confusing, but I managed.  I turned it in to the waitress and tucked back into my lukewarm sake.    At that time I noticed a man at the register who was trying to place an order To go.  The waitresses were having some issue understanding and entering, and suddenly the whole restaurant ground to a halt.  The chefs were all watching the girls, all 3 girls were intently focused on the computer (with my order dangling forgotten in one hand) and the client was making comment that he might in fact still be hungry by the time they figured it out and he got his food.    At this point the chef sees me starring at him in a hungry way and asks what I ordered.  I couldnt' remember everything, just a few, but gave him the clam miso soup and the salmon sushi.  He whipped up the salmon, and although the pale color was suspect of farmed quality, the portion was nice and not on a tombstone-sized piece of rice.  However, he painted it with a sauce I didn't ask for, claiming it helped enhance the fish.  I find that totally out of character, and worried it was more to mask a low-quality cut.  It tasted okay and I'm still here.  After my order finally was entered at the computer and printed to the chef, he managed to do the rest.  However, the clam miso and garlic edamame was coming from the back kitchen, which was very sadly inept.  Both items finally arrived after I had eaten all the sushi items, so I got appetizers last.  The clam miso was good and four littlenecks in the shell were a nice variety, but the edamame was crazy - there was literally a half cup of diced (from a jar) garlic sauteed in peanut oil and tossed/dumped onto the beans.  It was tasty at first, but just WAY too much used.  Garlic is such a strong agent, it isnt needed in giant gobs...it just about killed the dish and of course anyone who stood within 5 feet of me the next day.  Meanwhile, the couple's dirty plates to my left who had been gone awhile were still there when another couple arrived; there was almost no bussing done the whole time I was there.  They nicely shoved the dirty plates in my direction to the empty chair between us, and they too couldn't manage to get their drinks, or sushi, in a timely fashion.  I asked if they had been here before, and she said yes but didnt know why this time everything was so SLOW.  Everyone at the bar was being asked by the chef what their order was they had given the waitress; perhaps they need a new procedure.  I counted at the height of business, 9 people at the sushi bar and maybe 12 in the restaurant.  There were 3 sushi chefs, two more people visible in the prep kitchen, and 2 or 3 servers on the floor.  Nobody should have had to wait for anything, much less a clean place to sit down.  They all seemed to be SCRAMBLING but I couldnt figure out why....I've seen 2 chefs at a good busy restaurant handle everything plus To Go orders no problem.  These guys have issues.  I don't care if you serve exotic, rare pricey fish to your special customers, or cut cooked rolls to the newbie, if you're going to run a restaurant (and I'm in the industry) you need to make sure service is near-perfect.  I would have tried more items, stayed longer, and maybe visited again if the service and customer attention had been prioritized, but judging from other reviews and others that night who were having the same experience with poor service, I'll think I'll spare myself another trip here."}
{"text":"Thanks for Tien for setting up this awesome UYE! Minus the fact late for his own UYE. Lol!

AYCE is just the way too go get little bit of everything and keep going until one tummy is happy in life. Yummy talk about Sushi change up in life!!! Sometimes in life or food not about quantity but quality. OMG! Everything the quality was unreal. The sushi chef Eric showing us some of the fish just got in since was tuesday. He had this amazing looking needlefish or sayari. I never had before but said that few times. They have boards with different fish gets in every week everyone talks about the uni. Unfortunately they did not have it. =( The sayari sashimi style knowing literally cut fresh off the bone. It served with quail egg mixed together was perfect balance. It same came too sweet shrimp. Deep fry the head good stuff dipped in the sauce. Sayari bones too! Every sushi was amazing flavors, depth, and stuff like scallops never had in sushi restaurant. Scallops that blew my mind! Fresh Oysters combine with the sauce like slurp of sea heaven. Every sushi was more and more amazing. We ended it with american kobe beef roll that by far best speciality rolls EVER! Me more about the nigiri style sushi. It true sushi for me all about the quality of the fish and rice. Sushi in its truest form. Desserts we had the deep fried plum and black sesame seed ice cream. The plum had much more flavor then I could ever imagine. The crispy goodness outside mixed with the plum ice cream very nice. The black sesame seed honestly not fan of. I think that sesame seed in ice cream not meant too be just weird flavor.   The whole time thinking of Jiro \"dreams of sushi\".  I did have one roll. The whole presentation of just one nigiri, few course of sashimi style fish, and the presentations was truly artwork. Too the little details on the oysters it christmas assortment of toppings, sweet shrimp looked like gold flakes on top, sayari tight presentation with the head standing straight up and the quail egg placed perfect on top of the sashimi fish, and go on and on. Tell the passion sushi chef Eric has in every piece of fish. It really refreshing style too see non AYCE cares about the finer details. Once again thanks too Kevin the sushi chef Eric hooked us up with bottle of sake. Yay.  The service is awesome! Never empty glass and just on it. Without doubt I will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas. I've been to about 10 sushi places and nothing beats Yummy!! The fish is very fresh. You don't have to wait long for your food and they are super friendly. I recommend you try the Kiss of Fire roll if you like spicy. Screaming O, Cherry Blossom, Sex on the beach, Johnny and Japanese Lasagna. They do not have all you can eat but they do have happy hour after 10pm. I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Amazing tasting sushi. Fresh. Artistic food. Friendly service. Very busy place but worth the waiting (10-20 minutes) for rolls.  The reason I did not give 5 stars: The communication between the server and chefs. Orders were being missed on tickets due to the high volume of orders. The server and chefs were aware and were constantly checking in on each other to make sure orders were executed appropriately."}
{"text":"Got the Paradise Roll and some Yakitori--both were excellent. I was thinking as I ate that this must be one of the best rolls I've ever had. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile so this review is basically overall of my experiences there. We used to go there all the time, my son Cody told me about it. I love Eric , he was the owner when we went I was just wondering if he still is. He always seemed to be there and I was  wondering if he ever got a break,  but I'll tell you everything was amazing but possibly because he was there overlooking as well as working there, he never stopped. When I went there later didn't see him as much but I still enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Still the best neighborhood-feel, à la carte sushi restaurant with impressively (and consistently) delicious fish! The live scallop is my favorite - served in the shell. All plates are made with care and attention to detail, which we all know makes sushi great sushi.   It is really nice to walk away from a sushi meal without feeling like your belly is about to explode from every homeward-bound pothole (e.g. the all-you-can-eat sushi experience) and Yummy Grill is the perfect place to pare back to sushi basics, simply ordering one or two selections at a time. Enjoying each bite and discussing the flavors with Chef Eric and his crew of skilled fish-slicers makes for a very civilized and satisfying meal.  Love the strength of the iced green tea here. And the fish specials on the whiteboard are truly special.   Note: This Yummy Grill is not to be confused with or linked to the *other* Yummy Grills in the Vegas area. This is an independently-run store with its own high-end fish purveyors, and this distinction goes way beyond the typical variance among chain franchises. One bite and you'll know you're in a very special spot!"}
{"text":"This was the best Japanese restaurant we ever ate. Our waitress Claire was the most wonderful"}
{"text":"If there was a lower rating I would give me just that, a much much lower rating  Sushi was deplorable at best. Service a little better than the foid  Awful"}
{"text":"My favorite reverse happy hour. 2$ cali roll. 3$ spicy tuna. They have the best garlic edamame. 10pm to 1am is reverse happy hour. 3$ Asahi draft beer:)"}
{"text":"Sushi was good, service was ok. Took a very long time for 3 basic rolls...was beginning to question if they forgot about the order. The restaurant room temperature was very warm as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic sashimi!! Great sushi!! Service is always great and the staff is glad to have your business. There is a live seafood tank and they will prepare several dishes from there- including scallops!Almost took off a star because they always leave the back door open freezing customers at the back tables during winter months. Customers actually get up and close it themselves. Aside from this small annoyance, this is a great sushi place!!"}
{"text":"I wonder why I even bother with other Sushi spots.  From the moment we walked in to the time that we left the service was amazing. Water and drinks were constantly full and everyone had a smile.  Free potato cakes are the bomb. Garlic edemame and the spicy tuna rolls are hands down the best. I like to customize my spicy tuna roll with some jalapeños and eel sauce, they do this without hesitation and make it taste like heaven.  Prices were cheap, late night happy hour is legit since I get off work so late  5 stars"}
{"text":"By far best sushi in Las Vegas. So fresh and delicious. The presentation is always gorgeous! Last night we treated ourselves to the reservation only chef tasting menu next door. Beyond words! An experience we will remember always. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Good spot for hawaiian/Chinese food. I am giving them 5 stars, because it tastes good, and the Staff is always wonderful and  will always help answer any questions. Plus Everything I order is made Perfectly.  +   I Recommend the honey walnut shrimp & Chicken Lettuce Wrap.  I will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Yummy Grill Sushi is pretty close to us. I've been here about four times so far.  On our most recent visit we ordered: Tuna poki (chopped tuna, red onion, seaweed salad, sesame oil, soy sauce, green onion, and masago) This was my wife's favorite. It had a nice balance of flavors.  Uni (sea urchin) Very good and super fresh.  Spider man (spicy tuna, soft shell crab, cucumber, avocado, topped with eel, spicy yum yum, eel sauce and scallion) Pretty good but not as tasty as I had hoped.   Arizona roll (spicy yellowtail, scallion, cucumber topped with yellowtail, avocado, ponzu sauce and green onion). Good but probably not good enough to order again.  Crazy jalapeño (deep fried jalapeño, cream cheese, spicy tuna, and chef's special sauce) Pretty tasty and something I would order again.  We found a piece of plastic wrap on the Arizona roll so they offered us each a scoop of ice cream and the owner came over and apologized.  I ordered the black sesame and my wife got the green tea ice cream. Both were quite good. I'd never had black sesame ice cream before and found it quite intriguing."}
{"text":"I don't write very many reviews cuz I'm lazy and I'm picky as fuck! I have been to this restaurant five times now and every time I go I get something different and it's always super delicious and everyone is very nice.  Yummy Wonton soup is filled with goodies! It's exactly the way you want to wonton soup to be.  Bento boxes are flavorful and filling.   Egg rolls are killer!  They do not have all-you-can-eat sushi, so if it is just sushi you are after you might want to go somewhere else. But if you like a mix of hot food and sushi like I do, this place is a little gem.  Had their spicy ramen...not good. If you're a fan of ramen, you will be very disappointed at this attempt. They somehow think we won't notice the egg is an overcooked poached egg, and not the magical melt in your mouth soft cooked egg at traditional ramen places. No fun veggies and broth is bland. They clearly put this on the menu to appeal to all types, but it's a fat fail and kind of insulting. Everything else I've had is tits, tho. Still, love this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with a friend of mine.  We ordered 5 things and shared all of it, including a roll with Kobe beef. Everything was really fresh and the flavors were great. Sat at the sushi bar, the two chefs were busy the entire time we were there and that was on Saturday afternoon from about 1:30-3.  The chefs apologized for the wait, but as long as they acknowledged us, we were fine.  Other service just a little slow, but I'm not really complaining... I'll definitely be back, enjoyed the knowledge if the chef and the rolls were great!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. It looks like any other nondescript hole in the wall Sushi Joint, but is anything but. Even their Uni, which I've tried several times and not liked, was incredible. If I had to choose between Nobu or Yummy, Yummy would win 9/10 times."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest fish I have had here in Vegas! Food was so fresh & delicious. I enjoyed savoring every bite. Plenty of fish & my sushi was not overwhelmed with too much rice :) the only reason I gave it 4 stars was that service was a tad bit slow. Live Uni is a must here! Best sushi in Vegas"}
{"text":"Yummy is my yummy neighborhood sushi place.  The fish is so fresh it's still flapping in your mouth. The food is just great with top notch service.  And it's open till 1am. I love this yummy joint."}
{"text":"1st time here. We ordered the teriyaki combo and the seafood combo. Both were tasty and good. Serving is ample. Each combo is just about $10. There's only a few table so i don't know how this will be on a busy day. We ate saturday night, all 5 tables were full but moved quickly.   Service was fast and courteous.  The only thing I didn't like was the place didn't feel that clean. One of our fork and extra plate was still filthy. I hope everything else is clean.  We'll come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Unique & incredibly fresh fish that you cannot find elsewhere. Authentic style with numerous seasonal specials. These chefs satisfy all tastes. Very high quality.  Some of my favorites are ankimo, kamashita toro, fresh octopus, wagyu beef tataki, and fresh oyster variety. Anything from the Specials menu!"}
{"text":"Some of the best ahi & albacore sashimi I've ever had. Along with some Kikusui sake. Excellent!  Will definitely stop in next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Chef Eric is one of the best sushi chefs in town!  He consistently has the absolute freshest fish in town.  I started coming in to Yummy Grill for the Happy Hour.  I soon discovered the Omakase (Chef's Tasting.)  Yummy is simply the best in town...and at a price considerably less than Kabuto, Nobu, and Shibuya.  And while those are certainly much classier places with wonderful ambiance, the quality of the product is not better and any of them.  You will be hard-pressed to find a place with more live options.  Fans of uni are in heaven here!  If you are just getting cut rolls yummy is still a great place to go.  If you are into Nigiri, Sashimi, or Omakase then Yummy is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"I still enjoy this place very much and still go quite often. I'm only rating it one star less because today I tried their sushi just a basic California roll, nothing special, and though I thought it was very tasty,  it was very small in size. I'm not saying I was expecting some monster roll or anything,  but I've had my fair share of California rolls and this is the smallest it's ever been. It makes me glad I just ordered that and not something more expensive cause I'd be really pissed about it. They still have bomb Chinese food,  cant go wrong with a lunch special!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have become regulars here! We usually dine in and the service is great. It's a small, casual place to eat. We walk in, grab our own menus off the counter and pick a table.  We never wait long for our food to arrive and the employees are really friendly. Sometimes they get super busy with take out orders and may take a little while to check on you or bring you the check, but no big deal we just walk up to the counter and ask for what we need and they will bring it to you quickly. The food is so good, this is my favorite place to get sushi and their fried rice is the best. We will come here forever :)"}
{"text":"From Hawaii looking for a Trader Joe's for my omiyage and hungry for some Japanese food. Took a risk and went to this strip mall Japanese restaurant. Was very happy to hear Japanese spoken here and great sushi and other washoku food. service great, price right, very happy. Aloha"}
{"text":"I unknowingly came in during happy hour which is 4-6PM. I just want all of you reading this that their \"happy hour\" is a total SCAM. We ordered two rolls off the happy hour menu and out comes one roll. I asked the server when the 2nd roll was coming out but she nonchalantly informed me that their happy hour rolls are only 4 pieces. WHAT.... A .....SCAM... I was almost laughing when she said their rolls are half the size during happy hour. We also ordered two a la carte items off the menu and both were pretty bad. The fried noodles with chicken is supposed to be like a yakisoba. The noodles were comparable to the instant type you buy at the grocery store, they just added some pieces of chicken and veggies to it. The last dish we ordered was chicken cutlet. This dish came out so late that I ended up eating it by myself because my girlfriend finished eating her noodle dish and her half rolls. The place is dingy and the tables need to be replaced. I want to give one star but I don't want to be that harsh. I wont be coming back and I have no idea why there is no good restaurants in the northwest side of town. Every single restaurant I've been to in the northwest has been 1 or 2 stars. I can not trust any reviews made by anyone from the northwest because they think borderline subpar / bad restaurants like this with 4.5 stars is good. If you're craving sushi go to the southwest / spring valley. much better quality food and much better service."}
{"text":"Went to order the lunch special here. I opted for the fried rice and one of the server came back to tell us they didn't serve fried for for the lunch special. When it clearly states on the menu white rice or fried rice.   Also ordered egg drop soup/egg flower soup, it came out like warm not even hot.   They forgot about one of parties food, so they had to make it, while we're eating our food.  Taste of food is sub-par. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it opened. This place has the best fish in Las Vegas! The screaming orgasm and pork belly never disappoints.  Chef Eric has out done himself time and time again. Looking forward to trying their sister restaurant Kame!"}
{"text":"I was placed on hold for 25 minutes and when I arrived the last at the front said \"oh yeah we can't take phone orders until everyone ahead of you has been served\" who does that?!? I had to drive in to place my order and there is less then 15 people in this restaurant. She didn't offer me anything for my trouble except. Uh sorry there is nothing I can do for you. Very disappointed in this restaurant and service. I will take my business elsewhere from now on. Thank you very much.. for NOTHING"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! It is always so fresh and delicious. I haven't ordered anything that wasn't amazing. The service is outstanding also, very courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Really good Asian fast food / sushi joint . Reminded me of Gardena Bowl in Gardena Ca . Miso soup was on point as well as the food and service . Better than L&L and island sushi grill side"}
{"text":"We were here two days ago for our second Omakase experience as the first one here was just unforgettable! There were a couple dishes I was craving for from the last visit but unfortunately both of which were not available. One was the lobster 3-way dish and two was the hairy crab. Despite that, Chef still made this experience incredible for us! He made sure to pace every dish out and ensure to describe in detail what he is serving us. After  about 10-11 dishes we got extremely full and our tummies were extremely satisfied :). Thank you chef again for the wonderful experience as we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious. The American and Paradise rolls are favorites. Reasonably priced and friendly environment."}
{"text":"Just came back from another epic meal at Yummy. There's no way I can fully describe the attention to detail, passion for all things fresh and fabulous that Chef Eric, Sam and crew impart into all they present. Don't overlook them because they are in a nondescript strip mall in Summahood. Ish gets real here.   Really have lost count of the number of people I've dragged with, but perhaps my friend Tat (who lived in Japan for three years) being so moved after tasting the chu toro sashimi she exclaimed: \"Eric, that is the best bite of fish I've ever had!\" demonstrates most what to expect. Seriously people, they have the finest quality fish flown in from far and wide twice a week. The white board outside and at the bar lists the \"market price/live\" items; I've never paid more than $18 for any: a steal!   The Omakase is an amazing way to eat here: each course is progressing toward a crescendo that will knock your socks off. Again, super reasonable, paced expertly with sake/soju pairings available. You'd be hard pressed to find better dishes anywhere.  There's also plenty for the landlubber to dig into: Mom proclaims the chicken Teryaki combo meal (with a fork, please :) to be the bees knees. Friends who are crazy for yum yum sauce and baked rolls dig them, too.   Need more incentive? Happy hour daily 3-6PM & 10-closing (except Saturdays) will make you a believer and save you $$$.   My favorite menu items: chu and o toro, bluefin, live scallop, live lobster, live uni, giant clam, jinkemedai; sometimes I just ask for Eric's choice. The fresh ground wasabi is off the hook and the pickled version is a great twist. I Never pour soy sauce (Eric makes his own aged shoyu=I die!) or use the wasabi paste=each piece is perfect as served.   Just go, sit at the bar, enjoy the art created for you and the passionate people presenting it. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Late night happy hour is where it's at 10pm-close! Great affordable deals!   We are from California and we have a huge selection of sushi restaurants to select from.  So as picky as we are, we came here with high expectations and yummy grill met our expectations!   This place is definitely a quality sushi and nigiri restaurant. The fish was very fresh and handled with extreme precision and care. We enjoyed everything we ordered from the happy hour menu, but my favorite has to be the fish! They were all just so buttery and sweet!   Complimentary:  Korean fried vegetable pancake Imitation crab and pickled cucumber salad  Salmon nigiri (2 orders - 4 pieces)  So fresh and buttery. Very sweet.   Halibut nigiri  (1 order - 2 pieces) Great firm texture and mouth feel. Very fresh!  Yellowtail nigiri (1 order - 2 pieces) They brushed on a homemade seaweed soy sauce which is not overpowering at all. It is meant to be eaten as-is and not with any soy or wasabi! It really enhanced the yellowtail's flavor.   King salmon nigiri (1 order - 2 pieces) This was the evening's fresh fish of the day special. It looks more white than pink compared to regular salmon. It was very sweet and the texture was more buttery than regular salmon- I didn't think that was possible! It melted in my mouth.   Baked CA roll (1 order - 4 pieces) The simple comfort classic with yum yum sauce and baked! It was good, but filling!   Philly roll (1 order - 4 pieces) It was good, simple and fresh  Miso soup (1 order) Very quality miso soup! Not too salty, just right. Came out hot and satisfying.   AMA ebi (sweet shrimp with fried heads) (1 order - 2 pieces with 2 fried heads)  The presentation on this baby made me very happy! Little edible sprouts and flowers topped the sweet shrimp. I enjoyed them along with the fried crispy shrimp heads as well.   Spicy scallop (1 order - 4 pieces) This was my least favorite of everything we ate. They used imitation crab and I think tiny fried bits of scallop? It tasted more like imitation crab and fried tempura bits with mayo. Not the best. It didn't come out the way we envisioned.   Everything we ordered was under $30! Great deal for fresh fish for 2 people, we were completely satisfied.  This place and Sakana is our top picks for sushi in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is an essential spot for a serious sushi connoisseur. For starters, the chef guided us with a lighter and delicate fish, and moved on to darker, oily, and fattier portions. Their menu displayed fresh fish from multiple countries and creates a dining experience with perfect temperature, taste, shape, and texture with each order. I highly recommend this establishment, easily in my top five."}
{"text":"First off the waitress CeCe who is Filipino is completely RUDE!! I wanted to order the lunch special and she told me that I couldn't because it was a holiday. That would've been nice if it was told to me first after we were sitting there for 10 minutes. I asked to order a shrimp tempura appetizer. I'm Japanese and I said \"tempura\" the correct way. She in a condescending tone said you mean shrimp \"Tempura\" (Tem pooh rah) how usually a white person would, not knowing the language, like she was correcting me! Even my friend who was with me and is half Filipino found it rude. Then I asked how big the sashimi salad was, she came back after asking the chef and said big. When I said exactly what is big? She rolled her eyes and walked off to go ask again.   At this point, I ask to speak with a manager. She says to me, no manager is working but you can talk to my co worker. How is nobody in charge working? What if something happens? What's the point in that? I did talk to the co worker and I told him I no longer want her as a server. So he served us. He was actually very nice!!   I also want to note that the girl at the table in front of me had to get up and go to the bar herself to get a refill on water. That table did not look happy. The waiter kept apologizing profusely.   Then, after everything comes out, guess what is missing? My shrimp \"tempura\"! My friend is already done eating. At this point, I'm fed up! I walk over  to the sushi bar and ask the sushi chefs if there is someone working I can talk to because I'm over this! They tell me the owner is working and will get him! Wtf?!! The owner is there?!!  The owner comes out and he's Korean. It also took him forever to come out. It made us think he must not really care what is happening. When I explain what happened, and told him about the tempura he gave me a look like he also didn't understand why I was saying tempura like how it's supposed to be said in the Japanese way! Tempura is Japanese!!! And you own a Japanese restaurant!!! Anyway he eventually did comp our meals, which I did appreciate but I will never return. They also gave us the shrimp tempura to go.   When I got home and looked at the shrimp, they were all very thin and not what you would expect from a 4 star sushi restaurant. The lid from the sauce also came off because of the heat from the shrimp so it was drenched.   The food is decent (not 4 star yelp worthy) but honestly, it seems like from these reviews they really need to work on their customer service skills.   Do yourselves a favor and skip trying to get sushi in Summerlin! It seems like the only good sushi is in the casinos.   Since I can't respond to the owner's comment, at no point did we ever curse out the waiter or make fun of her!!!!! And if we did, then why would I be asking to speak with a manger or owner? Nor did she ever tell us that there was no lunch specials to begin with! Just look at the other yelp reviews based on the service here and you be the judge!    He also just yelled at me on the phone when I called to tell him on the phone that we in no way cursed at her or made fun of her! He called me a racist because of my review and said we made fun of her. How is saying exactly what happened racist? She WAS correcting me on how to say it. That's like me going to a Filipino restaurant and trying to correct them. He actually said what does you being Japanese have to do with it? And apparently I'm also racist because I said he's Korean. He also said the server apologized twice to us. No she did not apologize at all! When I asked did he witness her apologizing, he yelled at me and said I trust my servers! Then do you believe she really didn't roll her eyes at me when I asked about the salad? And I'm glad this guy thinks it's ok that she did according to his reply. The guy server apologized to us for our shrimp not coming out. The owner is extremely unprofessional!!! The manager Ryan had to get on the phone and he is extremely professional and had to rectify the situation.   You can look through reviews on yelp and see how unprofessional the owner is."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday. Discusting stench odor inside. Cooks cooking w/out gloves, and picking food off floor. Rice was greasy and over salted. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Literally so good! The only problem I have is they don't have an all you can eat option. Other than that, I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place made me mad today. Walked in at 4:45 right before happy hour was over and was ignored for nearly 10 minutes. Completely ignored!! There were 2 waitresses and only 3 tables including myself. By the time they got to my table happy hour was over and wouldn't let us order from the happy hour menu even though they gave me the menu AND the time frame was not even listed! It's like they did it on purpose. Rude rude rude! Needless to say with the many other sushi places to eat at I will not be back. Instead we went to OMG Sushi and had excellent service and fresh sushi."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  And I think I may have found my new sushi place (a lot of the ones I frequent have seemed to be going downhill).  Sushi is lovely, and for a fair price...I've always thought I had to settle for lower quality if I didn't want to pay a huge premium, but the sushi here is great and not so expensive.  I really liked the rainbow spicy tuna roll and the sashimi on rice dinner special.  Service is also fantastic, and I got a free fried potato pancake thingy while we were waiting for our takeout order.  The waiters are very nice here.  Will definitely be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"Ok I went in for lunch. Once again had a great experience. Kalbi al carte  Couple of rolls and my partner in crime had the Shrimp tempura . Great service as usual and food was spot on."}
{"text":"CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN: It is way more expensive than AYCE prices, but stick to the Sushi during happy hour and you are getting a good bang for your buck.  THE MEAT: I should've pulled a Sienfeld and quit while I was ahead.  That has always been my problem... I don't know when to stop with a good thing it always gets me in trouble.  Everything was so fresh and so tasty we couldn't stop ordering.  The Dynamite and Pork Belly were exceptional (the tempura was average, while the mussels were a little tough).  The Nigiri was TO DIE FOR.  Ridiculously thick and long portions of fresh and oily-buttery pieces that eclipsed the rice and all sushi joints I have tasted so far.  I actually wished the pieces were smaller to fit my mouth!  My favorites were the Kanpachi and Bluefin Tuna.  I should've ordered Toro (which I expected to get in the chef's choice of sashimi, but unfortunately did not get. Sniff.).  The fried chicken appetizer was very light and tasty (my son loved it), and the fuji apple sake we ordered would make any non-serious sake drinker like me happy.  We were already full but decided to go for the 15pc chef's choice sashimi platter.  First they served us a platter with sushi, and it looked uhmazing, so I said well we could just ignore the rice, but they insisted to get the order right.  So they gave us a sashimi platter with different kinds of salmon, kanpachi, ruby snapper, super white tuna and scallop.  Sigh.  Chef Eric, what happened here?  The sashimi slices were very thin, not cool to the tongue and, well... not as awesome as the sushi served us.  What a let-down. This definitely should've been a 5 star rating if not for the depressing sashimi platter.  Will we go back? Only for the sushi and only during happy hour.  Or if I felt indulgent.  I'M STILL DIGESTING... My nearly 200 dollar bill for me, hubby and my 2yo who hardly ate.  WANT TO SEE SOME FOOD PORN? :-) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?select=OsM2Z7Pf7gUd1jusZVjHFw#OsM2Z7Pf7gUd1jusZVjHFw"}
{"text":"excellent service when dining in. a little too small for space esp. knowing how popular they are. some of my faves items are: hawaiian bbq salad with ginger dressing, chicken fried rice, yummy bbq short ribs, double x roll. double x roll is juicy and crunchy.. w/ shrimp tempura, soft shell crab, cucumber, avocado, tuna, and spicy ponzu sauce. calling ahead of time to place an order is also helpful bc they do get busy, busy during lunch time."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great people. Fresh fish, and more options than your typical sushi joint. Wife and I sat at the bar and loved the entire evening. Would definitely recommend this place to sushi lovers."}
{"text":"We love this place and go at least once a week. Fish is always so fresh and served in such a timely manner. Song pays attention to details on every order and makes such good suggestions.   The Tova, crispy rice and spicy tuna, is the best!!! Always leave the restaurant satisfied and full !!"}
{"text":"The best sushi location I have found yet! Their spider roll is the best in town! I enjoy the fair priced food and quality does not suffer. Always a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Staff is very nice and have a tendency to recognize their regulars.  Service can get a bit backed up when they are very busy but I usually sit at the Sushi bar and the Chefs are very personable and attentive.  The Spider Man roll is my absolute favorite specialty roll on the menu.  It is very fulling.  Paired with the Tova Special it is usually enough to satisfy me.  However I still top it all off with a Salmon Skin Hand roll which is always incredibly generous."}
{"text":"Sashimi- Bluefin Tuna, Yellowtail Rolls- Yellowtail, Uni (topped with Ikura), Baked Cali roll Nigiri- Cherry Trout Other- Fresh Wasabi.  Chicken Teriyaki kid's meal with sundae.  I admit I grew envious of all the 5-star reviews that Yummy Sushi and affiliated Kame sushi have accumulated throughout the years.  The location being far up north has kept me away up until this month and I regret not living near this area now.  While I still would like to try the higher end Kame's tasting menu, no reservation for a family of four led us to an exceptional experience at Yummy nonetheless.    The servers were very friendly, very attentive, and explained many previously new types of fish to me when asked.  Everything I ordered was fresh and a burst of flavor.  The japanese uni was nicely sweet, creamy, and worked well with the large salmon roe on top.   The cherry trout I ordered off their menu of specials on the wall was sweet and enjoyable.  The sashimi was amazing by itself, but the fresh wasabi put it over the top!  I repeat: Get an order of fresh wasabi!  (Unless, of course, you aren't a fan of it's spiciness/horseradish-ish taste.)   For those who do like wasabi, you'll never want the fake imitation stuff again.  Yummy Sushi was very kid friendly and their chicken teriyaki kid's meal provided so much value.  Practically a whole bento box of food with the addition of a ice cream sundae to my daughter's delight.  Highly recommend this sushi spot.  I know I will be coming back with friends to try their selection of \"live\" ingredients like live shrimp and live uni.  By far, on or near the top of my list of excellent sushi in Las Vegas.

{"text":"Nothing to write home about but I suppose worth a 3-star review.   Opted to have lunch here yesterday and the food and service was okay.   Once you get past the server's broken English then everything else goes by smoothly.  Just asking for descriptions, item recommendations, and the like was a bit of confusion on both sides.    The food selection is actually quite extensive which includes Chinese, Hawaiian, and Japanese dishes along with a plethora of sushi and sashimi options.   My wife opted for the chicken and broccoli dish and a California roll while I had the French Kiss Roll and some saimin soup.  The saimin soup was okay, average at best, with the flavor of the broth leaving more to be desired.  I did enjoy the French Kiss Roll but the \"spicy\" symbol next to it on the menu could have very well been removed as there was hardly any hotness to the roll.  The chicken and broccoli is your standard chinese fare.  Overall, a decent quick lunch if you're craving sushi or Asian food in the area.  I will have to try some of the Hawaiian selection and shaved ice in the future."}
{"text":"I haven't gotten the chance to come back yet so this review is extremely bias LOL. Personally, I do follow ups review reading from other people and with further researching I clearly saw how accommodating this cute shop is. All of the replies from the shop to reviewers who has either given good or bad reviews is outstanding in customer service. I haven't seen a place that has went out of their way to make customers feel welcomed no matter what issue came up in such a professional manner. They did not attack the customer which some business do. I also understand the frustration of yelp reviews so a five star can go a long way.   Unfortunately I'm heading out of town for the next school year and won't be able to visit my favorite sushi place but I hope to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Some if the best Sushi I have had anywhere. I live in the LA area and have eaten at a number of the \"famous places\". I am not as big on rolls, I just like my sushi traditional style. This place is EXCELLENT.  Fish is extremely fresh, great traditional presentation of the sushi with the perfect seasoning for each kind of fish, freshly made wasabi, etc. Service at the sushi bar was great. Staff is extremely friendly.  Every time I am in town, I go out of my way to visit this restaurant. The food is simply outstanding."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best ramen I have found so far in Vegas. Its a small place but the staff are super friendly and the ramen is great! They also have great spicy garlic edamame. And they are so cheap! Great food and easy on the pocket is an A+ in my book."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi. Fresh fish daily, extremely wide variety of rolls. Sashimi was phenomenal, though slightly overpriced (17.50 for 4 pc. super white tuna). Teriyaki chicken was tough and cold, but the fabulous and kind service really boosted our Yummy Sushi experience."}
{"text":"I am a huge sushi fan, but the one thing is normally I only go to one sushi place (Sushi Sage). Many of my co-workers told me that I really needed to try Yummy Grill & Sushi, so I decided to go over and check out their lunch specials. They do not have AYCE sushi, but I was content with this because they have an awesome lunch special where you can get Miso Soup and a Roll. I ordered water, Miso Soup and the Baked Lasagna Roll and the total cost came to $9.25 + tax, which I fet like was an awesome deal for lunch. The sushi was by far the best sushi I have ever had and the Miso Soup was fantastic. The service was quick as well, but there is not much seating so I would suggest going prior to lunch rush or after lunch rush. I was very full after eating the soup and eating half of the roll. I will be going back for lunch again. :)"}
{"text":"Sushi and food very good in here. The only down fall is there is not ALL YOU CAN EAT! when I go eat sushi that is what I'm looking for as my son and I both loveeeee sushi and can eat a lot of it. To me it's only worth it if there's A.Y.C.E. Small small area for a restaurant. It's literally for small parties."}
{"text":"It took some searching, but I finally discovered the finest sushi on the Northwest side of town. Yummy Sushi has one of the most knowledgeable sushi chefs around, and his dedication  to his craft is evident in every bite. They have the finest, freshest fish in town, often offering live shrimp and other crustations. The the chef is something of a marine biologist, giving patrons the lowdown on the spawning habits, migration and such of the various fish he serves.   Aside from the superior fish, the service is also top-notch with a welcoming, genuinely friendly athmosphere. It tends to get busy in the evenings, but definately worth the wait. It's also a bit pricier the the AYCE joints, the quality is unparalled. Simply the best sushi I've found."}
{"text":"there are not many places that we would drive across town for....(mainly because we don't have much time nowadays) this place is definitely on our list of WORTHY!  The servers are always friendly, and most importantly, their fish is always FRESH! one of our favorite is the O-Toro Tartare and our other is the scallops in the shell!! not to mention, that fresh wasabi, totally worth the $2! treat yourself!  We haven't really tried any of the rolls since we're just devouring all the delicious sashimi! But we did try the Japanese Soft Shell Crab and it was super soft and tender on the inside, very tasty!  So far we've been there 3 times and I can foresee many more visits in the future!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite spot to go eat sushi. There have been a couple of times when the service is not on point but it seems to be only when we have had the gentleman servers (sorry guys not being sexist - but it's true). The food is delicious and the price isn't bad. Make sure to get a stamp card as each time you go, you'll get a stamp towards a free roll or teriyaki bowl. I hope you enjoy this place as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Staff friendly and knowledgeable. Some of the best sushi I have had in a long time. Definitely the freshest I have had in Vegas."}
{"text":"The salmon sashimi was excellent. The spicy Mexican roll was super. We loved the crab and cucumber salad. And hey, they have choc mochi! We really appreciate your big smiles at the sushi bar, Clyde! He was super to my little boys. We'll be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Find my self at this sushi joint once a week late night and pick up a couple items from the Happy Hour menu.. Can't really complain about this spot at all. Our server is usually a lady with braces and she is such a sweetheart always checking up on us and making sure where enjoying our meal. That's what i expect when i come to a restaurant. Very pleased and really hope this place stays open forever. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"They are so friendly and the sushi is great.  The prices are very reasonable! We love this place.  We even order take-out."}
{"text":"This was the first time my husband and I have been to  Yummy Grill and Sushi.    We hadn't had Japanese food in ages.    The place we planned to eat was closed for renovations but they recommended Yummy Grill and Sushi  when we asked if they knew of any other place where we could eat.    We were very impressed that our waitress knew the menu so well.  She was able to tell us where the fish came from and how the dishes were prepared.    My husband chose the tempura dinner and was very happy with his choice. It was crispy, hot, and the batter wasn't too heavy or greasy.    I had one of the combo box dinners that had salmon teriyaki, also some tempura, and sushi, rice, and salad.  All that plus the miso soup.  I was so stuffed that I had to take home leftovers.   There are still dishes we haven't tried so we will be back."}
{"text":"If you can manage to part with a little more cash than going to an AYCE sushi restaurant, this is just about the best you can get. I've sat down and ordered to go service and my order is made both ways to exact precision. I want my rolls \"easy on the rice\" and Yummy accomodates my wishes. Everything is just a little bit better here. I can get less expensive sushi elsewhere,  but better? I think not. Excellent chefs and very busy location so get there early!"}
{"text":"So I have to say thank you to all that yelped about this place because your reviews made us try it!  I wasn't sure how this experience would go because as soon as we sat at the sushi bar the hostess asked us to move over but now I understand why.  Even though it wasn't busy when we walked in... Shortly after it was packed!   I would like to comment on the freshness of the fish... The best I have had in Las Vegas.  Thick pieces of sashimi we started with and then went with rolls.  At first I was disappointed because they didn't offer all you can eat but in the end it was way better.  The flavor satisfied my appetite I didn't feel the need to stuff my face.  I allowed my taste buds just to enjoy the flavor.  Food quality was amazing. Service was good very attentive... Never asked for a refill of water.  Best part was when we walked out we didn't smell like tempera.   My favorite was the rock and roll.  Give this place a try but go early to sit at the small sushi bar.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and sashimi with decent price, around 20 dollars, and great atmosphere, I sat at bar, and could see clearly how they execute the sushi, very elegant! Cheap eel on rice! Yah!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish!  Great customer service and they will make ANYTHING for you!  That's my kind of place!  Will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I love going to sushi, it has become one of my cravings lately, though I don't know why.  Although I love it, it can break the budget.  One of my friends told me about this place and it fixes my cravings good.  I have had the rainbow roll, japanese lasagne, and a few other things and they have all been very good.  It's great when I am out running errands and want a quick lunch, and if the weather is nice I sit outside in the covered courtyard.  They will also do any of the rolls with brown rice, FYI, and that is hard to find for some reason."}
{"text":"After multiple check ins by other yelpers, I was like \"let's go there!\" Texted a few people to join me for dinner and off we went.   First thing I loved right off the bat was the free bottle of sake with yelp check in!! There was 7 of us, so of course they weren't going to give us 7 bottles. Our server said it's one per table, but was nice enough to give us 2 bottles:)   It took a little long for our server to finally get our orders in, but we were all chatting to kill time. The menu was pretty extensive with multiple rolls, appetizers, hot food and nigiri. I may have gone a bit overboard with my order, but nonetheless it was still good and managed to finish it all.   Giant clam nigiri: Anthony M. convinced me to try it after he saw some hesitation in me. He had tried it before and said he'd rather have clams cooked. I tried it, and I completely agree with him. It wasn't horrible tasting, just wasn't used to it. Chewy and seafoody is how I would describe it. I could have done with out it.   Toro (fatty tuna) nigiri: OMG this was amazing. Buttery, smooth and melt in your mouth tuna!!!!!!! I would have ordered more if it weren't for the other rolls I got. I don't think I'll ever look at tuna the same way after this.  Cherry Blossom roll: This wasnt a roll at all. Chopped up crab and soft shell crab covered with avocado and yum yum sauce. After a few bites I was over it. I never thought I'd say this about sushi, but I wanted it to have rice. I needed help finishing it.  Sex on the Beach roll: This was good. I don't remember what was inside but it was topped with tuna and avocado. But after eating that toro, the tuna on top of this roll was subpar.   This isn't an AYCE, so be mindful of what you order if you're watching for $. Mine was about $60. I had a good time with good company. Will definitely be back since it's close to work."}
{"text":"The sushi here can be of better quality. They do great service to the individuals who love less fishy types of food though. There isn't much to say, because I really did not enjoy my visit here. The rice is overflowing and the fish is not as fresh as it should be.  I do think their lunch specials are great though! However, Osaka's lunch special is much better because they let you \"customize\" it at no additional cost (usually)."}
{"text":"Love this place. No all you can eat menu option, however the prices are perfect for pigging out. Nothing fancy about the place. Just good sushi.   Salmon skin rolls are perfect. A lot of places load the rolls up with veggies and very little salmon skin. This place packs the roll with skin.   Philly hand roll is done cylindrical rather than cone shaped. Perfect for dipping in soy and wasabi at both ends.   Service is quick and the staff are super nice.  Great casual lunch spot."}
{"text":"We went there tonight and ordered their specialties but we were extremely disappointed. The sushi cut was not professionally done and eel bento taste terrible. We walked way charged with $100 per head. Incredible! Never go there again. Be aware."}
{"text":"Oysters are perfectly sauced & garnished for u & the most clean we've found anywhere!! Thank u Chef Eric!!"}
{"text":"They shop for the best quality fish for their customers.  The volcano is amazing, it takes a bit to prepare so we get it in as soon as possible. It is a masterpiece of gooey goodness that melts in your mouth ! Never had a dish here we didn't like. This is a small place, with wonderful service and fabulous food."}
{"text":"Ohhh the joys of quality sushi :-D I feel like a dope not coming here sooner since I use to work right down the street from it. I think it was the whole judging a book by its cover thing because a place called Yummy most like isn't so yummy....but this place sooo proved me wrong and I am truly grateful for that. The quality and freshness of the fish is what really won me over. I usually don't order salmon because I can rarely find a place that has quality salmon that will melt in my mouth. Every piece of fish was perfect! I ordered some rolls with tuna, salmon, and some kinda white fish....all was just perfect. Then I had to have some nigiri sushi that was tako and the best fatty toro I think I ever had :-D I wanted more sushi but stupid me ordered a salad too :-/ Next time I will not be making that mistake!   The best part about this place?? You get all this quality sushi for the same price you get at other sushi places :-D The bill can add up when you include market priced pieces in your meal but they truly are worth it. Plus get the fresh wasabi for the nigiri or rolls that you may want to add wasabi too. Such a small price to pay to get that extra something special added to an already delightful experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there yesterday about 5:30.  Called earlier about reservations and talked to two women who couldn't answer yes or no.  Not crowded; asked for the sushi bar and were jammed into the last two seats against the wall.  Ate two special rolls; one order of nigiri uni sushi; one order of live giant clam.  Not giant clam, but squid!  Had one large cold sake and one large Asahi beer, but waitress brought another beer after being told no more.  Do not taken advantage of. $90??"}
{"text":"This sushi place is great! The rolls were fresh and very tasty!! We also received a complimentary appetizer and a sushi sample, which was a nice surprise! Customer service was great and the food was delicious.   They don't offer AYCE, but the 4 rolls me and my friend shared were more than enough. I'll make sure to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness we made reservations! The place is small and crowded and obviously very popular. I recommend making reservations...you won't be disappointed.  I had the Bulgogi, which was really tasty but a little chewy and had too much gristle for my taste. Other than that, the sushi was so yummy, the vegetable salad and its dressing was awesome, miso soup really good, vegetable tempura and its sauce heavenly!  For dessert, we shared a plate of mochi ice cream. Our waiter allowed us to choose 2 different flavors so we chose green tea and mango. Both very good and refreshing.  Talking about refreshing, after the miso soup, we were given a slice of sweet orange and that not only cleansed the palate, but it was cool and refreshing! Nice touch!  Oh and one more thing....  Their prices are reasonable and affordable and they make it easy to come back often because eating there doesn't put a big \"ouch\" on your pocketbook! Bravo to its owner!"}
{"text":"This place is very small, BUT, I never had a problem with wait.  The staff is friendly and gave excellent service! The food was phenomenal. I had their spicy tuna roll and that was great. I also had their salmon teriyaki bento box, and it was alot of food, for the price and it was just so good. Definitely my new favorite sushi place closer to home. Too bad they don't have AYCE ! Then I would definitely be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Really love the sushi here!  for Chinese food my fav would be beef broccoli with fried rice, the Yummy BBQ chicken and the Yummy Soup 2! Oh and if you're a spam lover try their spicy spam musubi!"}
{"text":"The best Sushi Ive had in a while. As good as Yama or better. Outstanding quick and pleasant service. Would definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"first time to go there, it was OK, place is small & not organized, not very clean either, our table was # 1 so i could see inside the kitchen from my seat, didn't like the seen of the trash can right there inside the kitchen area where it was very noticeable  :(   although our server was friendly,  but he didn't have enough knowledge about the menu which was a down fall for us because we are not familiar with Japanese food to begin with ! food was tasty & yummiii, i see why they called the restaurant yummy, chef Eric is great & friendly & involving with customers, which i think that's why people could go back, so i might go back"}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi and service. Aaron was excellent,  he shared the different types available and gave recommendations.  If you are in the area deffiently stop at this wonder."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite Sushi place since I moved here summer of 2015 until tonight. Food is great but service was terrible! I haven't been here since end of last year, looks like new staff. If there's one thing that will stop me from eating at a restarting its HORRIBLE service!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi and you're up late, the after 10pm happy hour is a great deal. Most rolls were under $4. 4 for 4 with standard rolls. I specifically enjoyed the eel and the spicy shrimp rolls. I'm not too adventurous when it comes to sushi but my more experienced friend was impressed by the options. We were in around midnight Monday night and the staff was friendly and attentive. The non sushi happy hour options were limited, which is probably standard for sushi places, and according to the staff they typically have more items in stock on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They were missing some premium items on the Monday we visited."}
{"text":"What can I say the name says it all, it's very yummy! Went here with my boss and I loved it...the owner is great he was talking to us about the different types of fresh fish he purchases from all over and even showed us a sweet shrimp which was still alive maybe so we can see everything is really really fresh... In  overall service, food and Sapporo was great!!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi for such a random spot.  I no longer eat fish, but I came really close to it when we came here last. The Hi's hand roll was always my favorite! Now I just tell the chef's that I don't eat fish and they'll recommend and make me something that satisfies!"}
{"text":"Eric is amazing... I was a weekly regular before I moved out of town. Every time I go to Vegas I make sure I stop by to say hello. It is always a great experience! Also, the number one sushi restaurant I've ever been to. Here in Los Angeles , you cannot find this service, excellent food and price in the same restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very yummy food. They waiter was very kind and attentive. We also had a young lady tend to us a couple times. Very casual place for lunch. Really liked the cream cheese rangoons. Will definitely be stopping by here again! It was a quick visit, so not too much to say. Food came to us fast, so that's definitely a plus! It's hard eating out with a baby, because food takes so long to get to us, so they did a great job!"}
{"text":"Yummy Grill & Sushi is my usual spot with my girls when I don't feel like cooking, or we're celebrating something...or just because we can have one more bite of sushi anytime, after all I must raise them well.  I've known chef Eric's passion for sushi for over a decade and he is still surpass my expectations all the time...graciously extending lunch specials until 4pm when a Happy Hour starts up. I appreciate that they are considerate of the various Vegas lifestyles and schedules. I love that you can order high-quality and hard to find Nigiri and Sashimi in the same place that you can get happy hour rolls...very thoughtful approach. For lunch I often order their sushi special with 6 pieces of fresh nigiri and choice of spicy tuna or California. One of my daughters appreciates the tempura roll...so nice to have such a variety at one place. You can try all of them yourself and in the process define your taste for Japanese Cuisine...who knows, maybe eventually decide to take it next door to Kame Omakase...at least that's my hope for you...just like my love led me from Yummy to Kame.  My girls are more venturous in trying new rolls...also providing my opportunity to try rolls I otherwise wouldn't. Today they got sweet heart roll with sauce on the side.  Sauce is rather sweet for the girls being teriyaki based sauce with spicy mayo sauce, so having them put it on the side was good thing for them.  So the conclusion of this review is Yummy grill is good for everyone who loves Japanese Cuisine and if you like to raise up your pallets, step into the next door to Kame Omakase with the same chef, who awes me all the time, Eric."}
{"text":"We went in here for dinner. We were the ONLY people in the restaurant. There were at least 5 employees behind the counter eating, talking, etc. After waiting 15 minutes no one ever waited on us. They all just looked at us and ignored us. So we walked out and spent our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sometimes you eat at the three star restaurant and other times the three star place eats you.   I like to try restaurants with a 3 star or 3 1/2 star average. It does two things, reminds me of why I eat at four and five star spots and that sometimes the masses are wrong. In this case, the masses were right.   Stopped at Yummy Sushi out of convenience. The first sign of inferior food should be the name, \"Yummy\". I went in and fully intended to try sushi, but instead ordered the spicy ramen with added pork for an extra $2. I also ordered the steamed beef dumplings.   The Ramen broth was actually very good. A nice amount of spice and a decent depth of flavor. A few off putting things, chopped red bell peppers (I have never seen this type of pepper used in an Asian styled soup before), and the ramen noodles tasted like they were from a $.25 dorm room favorite. Beyond that, the pork was tender and the other veggies in the ramen were decent. Nothing to recommend so far.  The steamed dumplings were a little chewy and flavorless, but when drowned in the provided sauce, they were meh.  HIGHLIGHT: The service was crazy fast and super attentive. If it wasn't for this, you would be reading a two star review right now. If I could, I would give a two and a half stars, but I'm nice and always round up."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Vegas! Amazing fresh sashimi & great service! My favorites are the Tova Special, Anago, Kumamoto Oysters, and the Salmon skin salad. Weekly staples, w/Chef E and his staff, guarantee a longer life!"}
{"text":"This place knows how to whip up some good sushi!   I wanted a classier type date night with my husband, and we read the reviews on this place and decided we needed to try it. So, we found this place and when we stepped in the place we were immediately welcomed by the friendly staff. The place was just amazingly perfect in it's own little way.   Amazing sushi, amazing place, amazing service! This place has 5-stars from this couple! Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"A nice little neighborhood place for asian cuisine. They have a wide selection of foods, including sushi, chinese, and some Korean. I had the bbq short ribs, which were absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of spice and I didn't get an MSG headache afterwards (so not a lot of msg on there). Only one negative: the portion could have been a little larger. The plate only comes with three short ribs, which really isn't a lot of meat. I'm still hungry. But other than that, I give the place high marks. I'll be back soon to try other items."}
{"text":"I'll definitely be coming back soon!   Loved the Arizona roll-simple, delicious. I don't like a lot of sauce or crunch to my sushi, so it was a perfect fit. Looked like the menu has a lot to offer though, something for everyone!!  All the fish was sooooo fresh tasting, really a killer experience. I got some bluefin nigiri, and it was melt in your mouth perfection.   My favorite though was the Kumamoto oysters! Shucked to order then dressed with a perfect magical soy? spicy glaze. Really awesome, I went back for seconds.    Very nice service! Very attentive!! Can't wait to bring my husband."}
{"text":"Been going here for many years and I've never had any problems whatsoever. Customer service is always good and the food is always ready at a timely manner whether it's for dine-in or pick up. I really like their mahi mahi, spam & egg musubi, combination fried rice and their honey-walnut shrimp. The items are also moderately priced and great for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I must say this place is very consistent. The staff is always friendly and the food had always been really fresh. The prices are consistent with other sushi places of this quality that I have been to. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I don't really know what to say... I can't really go lower even though I want too... Only because I feel like maybe they deserve another shot?   I went there last night to order take out. I couldn't find their menu online. The place is casual... It didn't appear dirty... And the people were all nice. I don't eat animals or seafood... I'm vegan... And I specified that I did not eat fish and ordered the veggie roll and avocado rolls and the garlic edamame for my friend and I to share. I then went on to order a shrimp,lobster, and avocado roll for my friend once again specifying that I would not partake in eating that roll... I specified twice that the order was for two people... he then convinced me to order another avocado roll... Smart move.  They brought out my order and I noticed I had the edamame and just one carry out of food. I asked them if everything was in there and he read back the order... The seafood roll was in the same container as my veggie rolls! I was pretty upset. I asked them why they would do that if i specified that I didn't eat fish/seafood. I told him I'm a vegan and the thought of it kind of turns my stomach. He was like \"you didn't say you were vegan, you just said you don't eat or like seafood...\" I grabbed my order and left... What is the difference? If I don't like it and don't eat it, why put it with my food??   I brought the food home, opened the containers, and noticed... Only one place setting in the box... Great, one set of chopsticks!! Good job guys...   The garlic edamame was awesome and my friend really enjoyed his sea food roll. The avocado roll was okay... I am not into super warm sushi... And the rolls were really warm... The veggie roll had a ton of crunch... But it had fresh seaweed in it... I love dried sea weed... However... Fresh seaweed tastes entirely too fishy... And ruined and over powered the roll, I had one piece and was done. Over all my experience here was awful... Read the menu closely, ask a lot of questions, and break it down to stupid when ordering with this place."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi place I've been to out here in Vegas. Everything is so good! Service is always so amazing. Definitely recommend anyone to come eat here."}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. Ever.  So simple. Given, I'm an amateurish sushi eater, but this is some of the best fish I've ever been served. The ahi, hamachi and salmon sashimi are slices of buttery goodness. On both trips here I've ordered twice, bc I just needed more. The service is quick and attentive, and I hear that Chef Eric is the man, though I haven't officially said hello to him yet :-X   Know a true sushi beginner? Bring them here. They will be sold! Are you a sushi pro? Come here for some of the freshest fish in the desert."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot with ultra fresh sushi. We ordered tamago and ika (squid) sashimi. Nice. Vegetable tempura lunch box. Crisp, not overly oily and a side salad w/vinegrette lighter than traditional carrot ginger dressing. I liked that.  Also came w/miso soup.  Avacado roll, volcano roll and sorry, I forgot the last name but it was cucumber wrapped with micro radish, tuna, crab ?? Delicious! The volcano roll was considered a baked roll and was made w sweet crab and a variety of other items including scallops, mushrooms and avocado.  House tea was genmaicha which is one of my favorite teas. Another local favorite spot that we selected by yelp reviews! Spot on!"}
{"text":"I don't live near this restaurant and I stopped in thinking that it was the same restaurant as the Yummy Sushi on Sunset in Henderson. Wrong! In a good way.  This place is not that big, but looks very nice inside. We chose to sit at the sushi bar and the chef was very nice and knowledgable about all of the items they had to offer. I was surprised to see the substantial list of live items available that day.  All of the sushi we had was very fresh and tasty. We were not there during any special or happy hour and the price was perfectly reasonable.  It's a shame this restaurant is almost 45 minutes from my house or I would come back here all the time."}
{"text":"Eureka!!! We have found our Sushi spot!!! Las Vegas is filled with Japanese restaurants and as someone who loves sushi and can be a bit of a sushi snob, in it was hard to find a good sushi restaurant here. I uses to live near the ocean and had fresh seafood at my dispense, so I am pleasantly surprised how impressed I am by the quality of the fish they serve here! Definite nomnom in my tumtum."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in town! I always get the sex on the beach roll made with brown rice instead of white rice. I've gotten it to go a few times and it stays fresh all the way home. The fish always tastes fresh & most of the time service is really good. On my to go orders I have had them mess up my order a few times so I would definitely double check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and the sushi was fantastic! The tuna was to die for.. The place was a little small but had a great feel to it. waitress was promt on the service and refilled our drinks whenever they came near the bottom of the glass.. great place..."}
{"text":"These people were very nice! Delicious and beautiful sushi and my iced green tea was excellent! I sat at the sushi bar was assisted with my order. Drink and food served promptly. Started with cucumber salad and 2 bitesof this cute little pancake, followed with spicy tuna roll and as I was on my last piece of that my unagi nigiri was served. That is exactly as I like it, eel last.  Also, as I was finishing my iced tea I was offered a second glass, which I also finished.   They had TVs in the bar and dining area, tuned to ESPN and sushi info channels and nice ambient music playing. Reasonably priced menu. U"}
{"text":"So I used to like this place a long time ago. No wonder why I've never returned until now.. I ordered a HAWAIIAN CHICKEN BOWL, and I feel like I got ripped off because they gave me just a couple of pieces of chicken! My rice bowl was drenched in sauce which killed the flavor of my Vegis and brown rice. At this establishment always have your sauce on the side. Sauce too sweet! I'll just go to teriyaki madness next time."}
{"text":"The freshest  and most tender fish prepared well.  Chefs are very friendly and knowledgeable about the kinds of fish and where it comes from. Check out their afternoon \"specials\"."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh fish and great service.  However, plan on making a reservation waiting a bit to get in.  You will not be let down."}
{"text":"Prime Quality! Of course a little pricier than the AYCE joints in town but the fish quality is great! Eric the owner is really respectful and runs things well. Craving more sushi just writing this!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time last night.  Very much enjoyed it. Cozy community place with very skilled chefs. The fish was fresh and flavorful and excellently presented."}
{"text":"Me and my friend decided to go eat here for lunch before I had to go to work. Big mistake. The service was horrible it took them 15 minutes to sit us down and then thirty minutes for them to come get our orders. I would of enjoy my food better but because they took so long I had to pack it to go before I was late to work. It was nice that they were giving us free food for the wait; however, we didn't like the free food. I can't really rate the food because I didn't eat it fresh and I couldn't get the bad fish taste out of my mouth. I say if your going to eat here have 3 hours of free time apparently 1 hour and thirty minutes wasn't enough."}
{"text":"Great local sushi spot. Even on a wednesday it has a vibrant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent.... The staff was great. ..The food was great, This is by for the best sushi in Las vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and high quality sushi. Really enjoy the ambiance of the joint. A little tight, but in a comfortable way. We came during the late happy hour (10pm to close) and were blown away by the value. Will definitely be telling friends and coming back."}
{"text":"OBSESSED OBSESSED!  Sorry but I'm obsessed and the experience here just keeps on getting better and better...  the fact that they remeber me through yelp is even more of a graditude and SERVICE seriously can't express it enough on how much they wow me.  I always go only to have a little taster of stuff but it's so good that I just can't stop eating... always go in telling myself I will only get a few things! But I lie to myself every time!  PEOPLE!! I don't mean to hype this place up so much but seriously got to give them a try! Better than anything you could get on the strip I would have to say...   But i ALWAYS try a new place with no expectations... so if you do go in try everything that sounds good to you!"}
{"text":"Just great sushi! Found the Tova's Special and the Homemade Harumaki both great if you like crunchy!"}
{"text":"Probably top 2 or 3 sushi places in the Vegas valley. The fresh uni is to die for!!!!! Just the fresh uni alone is worth the trip. Do I need to write any more?? They have fresh uni!!!!! The otoro wasn't what I expected or id give 5 stars. It's got the same stuff as you can find everywhere else, but special menu items not to be found anywhere else. So that's what separates yummy from the rest."}
{"text":"A place I used to LOVE...  Unfortunately at lunch we had orders all messed up.  The only thing right the first time was our drink order.  The quality of the sushi is not up the the quality we've previously experienced.  Hmmm... time to find a new sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"You get exactly what you pay far, cheapest sushi ive found in town, i like the way the have it set up. quick and informal, greeeaaatt option fo rtake out or a quick lunch if you only have a little bit of time. i can not complain"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by for lunch today. He ordered the pork katsu bento box and I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box. The waitress brought us a small plate with 4 pieces of bindaedduk (Korean pancake) and 2 bowls of miso soup. The miso soup had a strange taste to it; it was almost sour. You could tell that the bindaedduk was microwaved and so the texture was rubbery and inedible. 15 minutes after we ordered or meals, our food still isn't out. Mind you, we are the only other patrons in the restaurant. Another 15 minutes later, our food STILL isn't here. Seriously? Waiting over half an hour for some sub-par bento boxes is ridiculous. At or around 12:45 PM, the Japanese waitress walks over to our table with our bento boxes in hand right as we are about to get up and leave. We asked her to pack our lunch in to-go boxes because my lunch break was almost over and I had to head back to work. Waiting for our packaged food and the check took well over 5 minutes. Okay. There was no apology given to us, they did not even come over to let us know that they're still preparing our lunch, nothing. This type of service is unacceptable and we will never recommend this poor establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi restaurant we've been to in Las Vegas. We've tried at least 8. We don't live nearby but we decided to make the trek up to Summerlin after multiple people recommended this spot. It was worth the drive.   We went around 4:30 pm during the happy hour. Tons of choices for great prices. We were stuffed and our bill was only in the $50 range. Go early and leave happy. You'll be glad you did.   Early happy hour is from 4-6 pm. Not sure when the late happy hour is but I heard they do have one."}
{"text":"After a couple suggestions to try them, finally got our fish tails over there.  Made good selections!  There was no need for wasabi and soy sauce.  The sushi we picked had their own special sauces and taste worthy flavors.   What we tried... Nigiri: Garlic tuna - great!  Cajun albacore - awesome! yellowtail and halibut Rolls: Vanessa roll - superb!  Cajun albacore roll - good; preferred the nigiri Ban Ban roll  If I had to choose only one to brag about, it's the Vanessa roll.  This had a delightfully nice balanced spicy tangy combination.    We chose a table instead of the sushi bar.  Didn't get to meet the chefs.  Even so, beautiful work on the flavors.  Kind and considerate service.  When we specified no sesame seeds, they came back to advise the sauce is made with sesame flavor.  We're okay with flavor; not fond of the actual seeds.  Nice of them and careful.  The restaurant space is long and fitted - a pant leg of a pair of skinny jeans.  A group of four is perfect.  Any larger is cozying up, but they make it work.    A high ten on flavor, quality of presentation, and specific request concerns, customer service. A little snuggly spaced interior, but many fantastic Japanese restaurants are."}
{"text":"Hmmm.. Okay so I got to Yummy Grill at about 3:40 and they sat me and let me wait to order until the happy hour at 4pm which I thought was very nice.   I ordered a few pieces of nigiri (yellowtail, salmon, unagi) and they came out pretty quickly. I was very impressed. It was so fresh (just like everyone says) The salmon practically melted in my mouth.   I got the garlic edamame which is a huge portion and also delicious.   We had the passion roll next and that was so-so. Not nuts about it.   The service during the meal was okay but nothing to rave about.   I'd definitely come back for happy hour and order all nigiri and edamame. It was so fresh I am looking forward to having it again."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. So unfortunate because I love the food here, but I will not return due to the inattentive service that ruined a delicious meal. I see no excuse as there were only 2 other tables (a 2 top and 4 top) and a couple of people at the sushi bar with 2 servers at 5pm.   Btw, happy hour sushi rolls range from $2-5. I thought, \"wow that's a great deal!\" But then the food was served and the rolls each came with 4 pieces. So really you are paying \"happy hour\" price for half of a roll... it would have been nice to know that otherwise I would've just ordered off the regular menu to have a full sized roll."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant accidentally, perhaps, it was the freshest sasimi I have ever had. The way they made it, it's neat. They care very sensual technical which can keep the flavor of if."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi place, owned by Japanese (not every sushi restaurants are). Location: They locate at Lake Meat and Buffalo, away from the strip so come here on holidays would be great, not crazy busy.  Food: I eat mostly sashimi. And this place has very fresh raw fish, sea urchin, and other kinds of seafood. So I believe their rolls would be great too. If you are an Oyster's fan, this is the right place for you. They have 3 kinds of Oyster with the same very reasonable price ($3 each) including Shigoku oysters.  I also tried their live lobster ($50 each and one is good for 2 people). Half of it made sashimi and the other half cooked in sea urchin sauce coming along with lobster miso soups. I was really impressed how good it was. 10 out of 10 for live lobster. Besides, fish livers are something you should try too. They are served with masago on top and citrus sauce.  And the last thing I want to mention is they have FRESH WASABI. I couldn't find it any where else as far as I know. It's not as strong as the regular wasabi. The taste of fresh is always better right?  Service: We usually come there on weekend so they're always busy. However, we were seated within 5-10 minutes, food came out fast, our server stopped by every 5-10 minutes, and they are very friendly. This is a plus since sometime rude servers can make you lose your appetizer even though the foods are great.  And last but not least, this place is very clean. You won't see any trash on the floor or food left on your chairs and table.  Overall this is a great place for great sushi at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Definitely at the top of my go-to sushi spots!  They have the best selection of fresh fish and specialty items, I don't really see anywhere else.  The chefs behind the counter are super friendly and mix it up from time to time if you want something different."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is my favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas.   Since Eric, the owner/main sushi chef, took over back in 2008 this place has been FANTASTIC.   As far as pinpointing my favorite item on the menu...that's difficult. I love the Passion Roll and the Tuna Karai, which is EXTRA spicy here. The Screaming Orgasm is also fantastic.  All of the hot food I've ever had here has been great as well, especially the Bulgogi Beef and the green onion pancakes. Absolutely delicious!  Aside from the fact that Eric is a fantastic cook, he is a very warm and friendly person. I can't count the number of times that I've been having a meal up at the sushi bar and we've ended up talking for a solid hour or more about our lives and whatever sport happens to be playing on the television. He's also occasionally makes me a random roll for free to try out and none of these random dishes have ever been disappointing!  While some will be turned off by the fact that this spot doesn't have an \"All You Can Eat\" option, I think it's worth the extra money considering how amazing the food tastes."}
{"text":"Great food. Been there a hand full of times and it's always been on point. It has plenty of options to fit families with picky eaters such as myself don't like sea food but my whole family does."}
{"text":"To all the real sushi lover, Yummy Grill and Sushi is a good place to go. They have fish that I haven't try or heard of before. Service is good, staff is friendly, and the place is clean. Then you would ask why 3 stars only. If you are true sushi lover, you would like to taste the fish which you don't need other thing and have the fish to speak for itself. However, the fish is good but I just can't taste the freshness of the fish. If you been to Kabuto before then you will know what I mean. I don't mean the place is not good but I heard so many good things and may be I expect to much. One thing for sure, they are not expensive, the price is reasonable. Go try and you make your own judgment."}
{"text":"Really good sushi.  Great service.  Totally reasonable prices.  Will definitely come back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here because we were craving sushi. We ordered the 21 piece sashimi dish and the come to me roll. The roll was yummy and flavorful. It was just drenched with too much sauce. The sashimi was good. Our favorite was the salmon sashimi. They were also very nice to give us a cucumber and green onion pancake starter."}
{"text":"Just picked up my dinner tonight and as always, it was amazing! This place has the best sushi in town. It's fresh, flavorful and delicious! I've ordered the Tiger Roll II, Avocado and Spicy Tuna roll. So good! The Chinese food is good too and that says a lot coming from a New Yorker!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant, but don't underestimate them. They have awesome happy hour deals and great service. If you come during the dinner rush, seating availability is tight. Luckily, happy hour is in the early afternoon or late at night when the crowds are a little thinner. The prices on the happy hour menu are crazy cheap which makes it great to try anything new that you haven't had before. My husband and I have been here several times and the food is always fresh and delicious with great service!"}
{"text":"Ymmuy is a unique sushi hotspot on the northwest side of town.  Late night spot for HH is rare in this area so when I found out about Yummy I had to give it a shot.  10pm-3am is very Chinatown-like which is awesome.  Sake for under $5 and dozens of rolls under $4.  They also have the typical gyoza, edamame, and miso soups for about $3-4 each.  I ordered miso soup, edamame, spicy crab roll, spicy yellowtail roll, and seaweed salad.  I would say the highlights were the seaweed salad and yellowtail.  Just a nice refreshing salad for a late night appetite and yellowtail with a great kcik and certifiably fresh.  The crab seemed over saturated in sauce and the miso and edamame were just ok, but still no regrets in the orders.  Throw in 7 sake and you got a hit. I was very happy with the meal overall and add Yummy to my shortlist of late night sushi good eats."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, Food was always pretty decent the service WAS fabulous however today the worst experience I've have or had I think anywhere in my life, besides!being a cockroach on the floor I was told my food was running behind because it was dropped on the floor and then when I finally received my food it was the most disgusting sushi I have ever tasted in my life all rice and a mess I don't even know what was happening I asked if it was under new management what was happening is training going on they just looked at me dumbfounded and said everyone is just slow today LOL I'm not impressed I will never be returning and I will never recommend this establishment to anyone! Owners get it together, this is a horrible way to operate!"}
{"text":"nah. my friends did not like the poke/seafood salad...and i tasted it, it was not GOOD."}
{"text":"Pretty good fast Asian food. Nice service. And they got brown rice , so it works for me!"}
{"text":"The chief was really helpful. Everything he recommended taste fresh and delicisous. I would defenitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi amazing staff! Chef's from all over the Vegas strip bring class to a neighborhood sushi spot! Get the paradise roll or kiss of fire if you can afford the calories or if not the Hawaiian roll with coconut flakes is amazing as well :)  Spent so many birthdays and anniversaries here ! Eric the owner is amazing and generous! He supports our Las Vegas  figure skating club non profit organization as well most recently helping donate items for our raffle , celebrating the kids accomplishments for the year . Best sushi in town and in my opinion the country !"}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about my sushi . Many sushi restaurants claim they have fresh fresh but yummy sushi delivers . Besides the normal menu chef Eric has alot of specialty dishes that not on the menu .  This place is for true sushi lovers . The rolls amazing good ."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! Idk who they've hired in the morning, but the young kid at the counter needs a lesson in customer service. In order to keep your customers you have to feel welcomed.   Disappointing"}
{"text":"There are so many restaurants on Eastern that each one needs a few dishes to stand out from the rest when everyone is serving the same stuff.  As you walk in, the atmosphere is mediocre. Nothing fancy. The is counter is right at the door  so I ordered. What I didn't know is that if you dine in, you are seated and then they take your order. So, they could improve on the ordering system as well.  And because I used up all my cash at the counter, I unfortunately didn't have the opportunity to tip the wait help. Sorry about that, but I will next time because there will be a next time. By the way, the service was good.  The one fix I needed was Meat Jun. And they did a great job on it. The meat was well marinated that I really didn't need the dipping sauce for it.  Unlike regular Korean restaurants, they serve bon chan, the little side dishes. So because this was an Asian restaurant, no bon chon here.  But that's okay.  The mac salad could use a little help. To the owner of the restaurant, if you are reading this post, may I recommend changing the HI-style mac salad to the Japanese potato salad, since you also serve Japanese food? I still haven't found a Japanese restaurant that serves that particular potato salad and it is one of my favorites. I have to go to HI to get it or Rancho Cucamonga, CA to the Mexican rotisserie chicken restaurant that is Japanese owned to get that potato salad.  All-around a good experience."}
{"text":"Favorite place for sushi! The rolls come out super quick, and the prices aren't outrageous. I love sitting at the bar, everyone is super friendly and it's a great alternative to waiting for a table, seeing as it's a small place it tends to fill up quickly."}
{"text":"Yummy Grill & Sushi is NOT an AYCE spot. This is one sushi restaurant to come to if you want to try foods that are a little more \"exotic,\" and not usually found on other Japanese/sushi restaurants' menus in town.   My friend and I came here and ordered several items. There's a standard menu that lists their appetizers, hot foods, and sushi, as well as a separate happy hour menu featuring discounted rolls. Additional items are also posted on the walls.   Rolls - Tomo Devil, Come to Me, Dynamite roll. The Tomo Devil was my favorite because of its spiciness. The Dynamite roll was reminiscent a typical Dynamite served in a bowl. Even though the roll was good, I'd probably would order the bowl version. Come to Me was also tasty. The sauces on some of the rolls we ordered had a surprising citric flavor, which was a nice touch.  Sashimi - Blue Fin Tuna and Toro: Damn, these were good! So delicious and very FRESH! These can be ordered sashimi style or sushi, go with the sashimi.  Kanpachi with Serrano: This was my least favorite. The kanpachi wades in a spicy sauce with an unusual flavor that's difficult for me to compare it to something that I've had. Tiny slices of serrano peppers with dabs of sriracha are placed upon each slice of fish. To me, the kanpachi by itself would've been perfect, but I just wasn't feeling the other flavors.   Dessert - Fried Green Tea Ice Cream: Both of us were already stuffed to the max, but we thought to end our dinner on a sweet note with a bowl of fried green tea ice cream. There are many flavors to choose from, such as black sesame seed and plum, and the usual vanilla and chocolate flavors.  Service - Make reservations. It tends to get busy around 6:00p.m. We arrived before then when service was prompt, but as the evening progressed we had to wait a little longer. However, waitresses didn't neglect us and attended to our table often.  Other - They have a stamp card system in place, woohoo!  Overall - Solid sushi/Japanese restaurant. Next time, I'm trying the live octopus salad!"}
{"text":"I'd give zero if I could!!  A couple weeks ago I stopped by on a 20 minute lunch break & requested a specific tuna roll with shrimp & ponzu sauce to go. I waited & sipped my coffee, I could hear the sushi chef making fun of me for bringing coffee w/me to sushi. Then he makes my roll, closes it, winks to the waitress while laughing & says to me- she'll give it to you then whispers in her ear, I had already tipped this jerk 5 cash in his jar-next time I'll wait& next time I'll check the roll before I leave. I get to work & it's spicy tuna roll with white fish, jalapeños, etc. The white fish looked sticky & old.   He knew exactly what he had done by making me the wrong roll. He also screwed up garlic tuna, you have to work to do that!! This was the lakemead , tenaya location. I would've been a regular 4-5 days a week if he hadn't been SO rude & judgemental & I would've taken it back but I was on a 20 minute lunch break & by the time work was over they were closed- they lost a good customer.. fire your young sushi chef- he's a jerk!!!"}
{"text":"What I got: live uni, sweet shrimp, sake, hamachi, amberjack, king salmon, etc How much it costs per person: $30 - 40 How it was: shared the uni bowl, very good! sushi was great too!  Ambience: nice Service: sushi chef was very helpful  GOFORIT!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place slit when I used to live in north Las Vegas moved to blue Diamond and today I es just close and remembered how great this place is, so I'm coming here more often. Waiter  is amazing"}
{"text":"Yummy! You have set the bar so high for all sushi bars!   Eric is an amazing Sushi chef. He and his chefs not only make you feel at home they treat you like fam!   The food is sooooooooooooooo fresh? You can always taste the quality and difference!   Fresh wasabi!!! Yum! I am a fan of AYCE but when I come back here I always know what good sushi is like NO ONE compares!    Thanks Eric for great service,Amazing food and good times!   Happy hour is amazing there!   Ikura, screaming O, hotate YUM!"}
{"text":"My family and I have basically become regulars at Yummy Grill Sushi.  We always have a great time when we go there.  Great customer service and sushi.  Try the green iced tea and the double d roll, its our favorite!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service (phone). Got hung up on 8x not to mention my very 1st call I was placed on hold for 5 minutes than hung up on. Boyfriend tried calling 5x only to be answered and hung up on too. Finally someone (female) answered only to be told \"call back in an hour to place your order because the health department was there...CLICK!!\" WTF! kind of customer service is that unless they were getting shut down by the health department.   Sorry but NOT sorry for losing a repeated customer."}
{"text":"Yummy girl and sushi is one of the best sushi bars in town. I usually go for all you can eat but when I want take out or to keep it light I love coming here. The fish is fresh, and the happy hour is perfect. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and they gave us cake and salmon Kama on the house!! Good day on the end of 2016."}
{"text":"HUGE DISAPPOINMENT...saw the great reviews about the lunch special. Pick 3 items for $13. I chose a Unagi bowl, tempura bowl and salmon sashimi. On the menu the items look like a good size. When it came out the bowls were half the size of the picture. My miso soup bowl was bigger. The tempura bowl came with 1 shrimp 1 onion and 1 sweet potato slice. Unagi bowl came with 3 eel slivers. Sashimi was 2 slices. We also ordered a Philadelphia cut roll off the regular menu $9. It was one of the thinnest full priced rolls I've ever seen. I gave this place an extra star because the server was nice."}
{"text":"The name speaks for itself. My bf and I have dined here many times and I realized I haven't written a review.  Located in a strip mall two doors over from the Big 5 Sporting Goods store, and next to Jimmy Johns. It is easy to miss.   It is said to be owned by a chef who mixes up the menu daily with fresh fish that are flown in from all over the world. Their menu is extensive. The place is small so you might want to make reservations for a big group.  We love the rolls that uses cucumber as a roll such as Johnny roll, Rock and Roll, and we also request to custom a roll and they make it so perfect. For appetizer, I tried Fried Scallop, Chicken Yakitori and I found their Coconut Tempura to be my favorite, really crispy and fresh.  Their House wine is tasty too.  The service is always fast and attentive. A must go!"}
{"text":"Super good food.  Owner has so much passion, top quality fish.  It's super busy on Xmas night.  Owner came around and gave us more sake on the house because we had to wait.  Great and friendly staff.  Wish we made reservations on the sushi bar for more interaction."}
{"text":"Super duper small place so call ahead before making the trek. Grandma wanted to take us to dinner tonight and she wanted sushi. Who am I to argue? (I LOVE sushi in case you don't know.)  Pros - The food has been consistently very good all three times we have come. - I love the intimacy. It's not an elegant intimacy. More like 'I found a secret garden', so nothing fancy.  - Sushi rolls were really good. And the rolls have a good fish-to-rice ratio. not too much rice and the rolls aren't small. - The kalbi(?) ribs are wonderful! - Shannon & the kids really liked the Japanese Fried Chicken.  Cons -The food is good, but it takes a while. We've eaten here three times & we have consistently needed to be patient.  - The bar is not a full bar and only has beer & wine. I'm not a beer or wine guy. I like my Jack Daniels, so I drink water when I come here.  - I really like brown rice with my sushi and the sushi resturants who do this have a special place in my heart. YummyG&S offers this, but it's an additional $2. Call me cheap, but I'm paying extra for brown rice.  We are fans and we will be back for sure. 400+ 4.5 star Yelp reviews can't steer you wrong."}
{"text":"Being that I had been here once before for happy hour it seemed like a good option for lunch while my car was at Discount Tire. Nope, never again. I was seated, my drink order was taken and the waitress never came back.  Since I was just killing time anyways I finished my ice tea and left. As I was crossing the parking someone starts running after me yelling, ma'am, you didn't pay for your ice tea. You're damn right I didn't. You can't bother to check on me for 40 minutes but run after me for an ice tea! Her excuse was that the waitress was new. Not really my problem!"}
{"text":"The only way to go here is to FOCUS ON THE BOARD behind the sushi bar for some of the best seafood selections you'll ever feast on. Chef Eric prides himself on getting the highest quality seafood three times a week from places like Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Alaska, Boston, Santa Barbara, and Hawaii to name a few.  If you come here and grab a table, order up a few rolls, or a lunch combo, or even worse, get items to-go, I can't help you there...you're on your own SUCKA! If you're looking for quantity/AYCE, this is not the place...if you're looking to dine on some of the freshest seafood options, you can go to places on the strip, or even to Kabuto and spend an arm and a leg, and still leave hungry with a lighter wallet.  Chef Eric's Omakase is not only delicious and adventurous, you leave satisfied, and educated. He is not a \"turn and burn\" chef, but exactly the opposite. Just about every picture I've posted are edible creations of his skill, passion and talent that tastes as good as they look. Being friends with other sushi chefs in town, he knows what every one else is getting, and what he chooses is top tier stuff. If product isn't up to his standards, he'll send it back, so purveyors know Chef Eric VERY well.  This recent visit, Eric wowed us yet again with his creations, and here is what our   adventure consisted of:  LIVE MAINE LOBSTER TWO WAYS: -Poached with Uni-Citrus Beurre Blanc -Sashimi with assorted caviar LIVE BOSTON SOFT SHELL CRAB LIVE BOSTON SCALLOP SASHIMI LIVE JAPANESE CONCH SASHIMI SPICY ALBACORE WITH PONZU AND CRISPY ONIONS ASSORTED NIGIRI: Live Maine Lobster, Live Boston Scallop Fin, Live Boston Scallop, A5 Australian Wagyu, Inada, Shima-Aji, Halibut Fin, Japanese Snapper, Hamachi Belly, Aoyagi, Alaskan White King Salmon, Snow Crab, Live Mirugai, Anago, Unagi, and Toro Cheek.  What you want to spend, how much time you have, and what's fresh/in season are factors to look at when arranging your omakase adventure with Chef Eric. Its worth doing at least once, especially if you enjoy quality seafood without the absurd prices on The Las Vegas Strip.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter :   \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/                                \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  10"}
{"text":"Great little sushi place. For starters let me say by walking in it's nothing impressive, it's small but everyone is friendly and the sushi is 5star. Although the rolls are small they carry a big delight!   -Garlic edamame - it was great but way to spicy! Order it mild!  -Ban ban roll- YUMMY! Our favorite!!  -DYNAMITE- omg deliciousness, 2nd runner up -Kiss of fire- Good but not as good as other -garlic tuna sashimi- good and fresh -spicy albacore sashimi- good and fresh   My only complaint was I felt like the servers were hovering around us and wanted us to leave. We didn't feel we were able to relax and take our time with drinks and eating. We would of stayed longer if we weren't being watched by 3 servers ready to clear our table!   We checked in on yelp for 10% off but the bill did not reflect f the discount. Totally bummed"}
{"text":"This little place was absolutely  amazing. Priced just right. Fantastic selections!!!. Unusual sushi items. The monkfish liver was cosmic. I'd eat here everyday if i lived here"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant! Delicious toro.  Everything is fresh. Always great service - my cup is never half empty. Seriously, they always make sure it is full! The fried scallops are delicious. I ordered them on accident once and have been hooked ever since. They have a check-in reward for a free bottle of sake, but since we don't drink sake they gave us a free order of edamame instead."}
{"text":"I haven't had such fresh and tasty sushi for months! I was totally amazed with its freshness of fish and live shrimps. I ordered 3 of live shrimps sushi. Chef brought over life shrimps to table to show us they were still alive before preparing. After my first bite, the sweetness of live ama ebi was dancing on my tongue!! I was disappointed that they ran out of live sea urchins. However, the sea urchin sushi I had was very very fresh and you could totally taste the sweetness of fresh uni. And chef was pretty generous with uni. I also tried their halibut caparccio, salmon skin hand rolls and giant claim sashimi. All of them tasted pretty good. My only complaint would be pork cutlets. Pork meat tasted kinda dry. It came with pretty nice portion. I just wish meat could taste tender and juicy. Overall I had a great time here. Both my tummy and taste buds felt very satisfied. Although this place is far from where I live, I am sure I will be back soon. Next time, I gotta try LIVE SEA URCHIN and ABALONE."}
{"text":"It's just OK!!!  Came here for dinner one night.  Around 6pm the place was packed.  I got the corner seat at the bar, maybe the worst location.  I wasn't sure which chef was serving me, when I ever did get served.  The manager did notice I had no food for awhile, nor was anyone paying attention to me.  My hot tea was filled several times, that's only because the waitress kept passing by.  She was serving the guy next to me way-to-much sake.  He got louder and more annoying. I guess nobody knows to call it quits, neither the chefs or his gf.  I wanted to try the live Uni on the board. But by then I got full.  I wasn't sure if it was from the food or drinking so much tea.  I'll give it another shot later, but for now, it's just OK!!!"}
{"text":"Great that they are open late and have a late night happy hour! I finish work at midnight and I'm so happy there is a sushi place nearby that fits my crazy schedule!"}
{"text":"Blue Fin Tuna is ohhh so delicious!! I also ordered the Paradise roll (which was full of flavor and tasty!) I ordered take out after a long day at work. It was my first experience ordering take out and eating from this fine establishment!! Great service and location was prime! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Its kind of hidden in the shopping center, but that's okay. I had the combination plate with california roll and teriyaki chicken. It was such a big serving and filled me up. At the end, they give you a slice of orange, which may seem like nothing, but it's a little touch that shows they care. I love watching the sushi chefs prepare rolls and enjoy talking to them as well!"}
{"text":"Good lunch special but poor service. The lunch special here is hard to beat. You can pick 3 small bowls of different menu items for only $12.95 and it includes miso soup too. I had the eel bowl, spicy salmon bowl, and seaweed salad. The eel was the best of the three. However, the service was very slow. One of the people I ate with ended up canceling part of her order because it was so slow in being prepared. I probably wouldn't drive out of my way to this restaurant, but I would think about coming again if I were on that side of town anyways."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I ordered takeout which was ready in 10 minutes! However I was sorely disappointed with the spicy tuna hand roll. It did not taste fresh and it was TINY!!! Also, DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN KATSU!!! I ate a few bites and could not stomach the chicken any longer. It was like biting into an eraser. I couldn't even chew it without wanting to gag. What a waste. On the plus side, their Mac salad is probably the best I've ever had!!! Fix your chicken Yummy Grill, that's unacceptable for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down, the absolute BEST Japanese Lasagna in town! Excellent hospitality and very clean!!!"}
{"text":"When dining in, the staff is friendly and understanding. The rolls are also to die for. The only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars is because they've messed up our to-go orders a few times. They have either forgotten a roll or messed up a roll order. We weren't charged when they forgot a roll, but it's still disappointing to get home and expect something that wasn't there all along. When they messed up a part of our order, we called them and they'd offer to fix it but we'd turn it down because it's 25-30 minutes away. That leads me to this tip: double check your to-go order before you leave because they don't show you what's in the bag when your order is ready. We've learned our lesson after those times and remember to do that now."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night w/ my sister. I noticed the robust & friendly greetings as the customers walk in. We sat at the bar where the owner/sushi chef Eric served us. The place was nice & clean.   I was really impressed w/ how he would give us brief information & a visual of where he got each sea creature & fish before preparing & serving it to us. Everything was made fresh right in front of us even the decorative garnishes. He seemed very passionate about his culinary skills.   When we got our food, it was love at first bite!  Everything was so good & fresh & nicely portioned. I was floating on cloud 9. The live shrimp was awesome. LOVED everything! He let us try  some samples & they were amazing. The service was great. Never had to ask for refills on my green tea. For dessert we had the black sesame ice cream. It was good. It kinda tasted like cookies & cream. This is my new favorite sushi place. I'm definitely going to try to come here every week."}
{"text":"I've been going to yummy for years. I love this place and Eric is the best!! It's small so don't expect to be seated right away on a busy night, especially at the sushi bar. The rolls are big but not so big it doesn't fit in your mouth like other places. Way better QUALITY then any ACE."}
{"text":"Not fresh at all. One of my order is Japanese Conch Sashimi so poor quality. Unfriendly waiter. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi experiences I have had in a while and I am super picky.  Warm delicious rice with cool super high quality fish.  The super white tuna was amazing.  Homemade soy sauce and real wasabi.  This place is the best I have had in NV"}
{"text":"Great quality fish at very reasonable prices! Happy hour is great!  Came in for HH on a weeknight, Allen the owner/chef was there and made my sushi for me. The prices at HH are about the same as a normal sushi restaurant, so it wasn't a deal, but the quality of the fish was superb! The only downside was alot of the menu was not available, Bluefin Tuna, sockeye tuna both of my favorites. I was told by Allen that sometimes their supplier is limited and the fish variety depends on the season. So there's no real consistency with the supply.   The service was decent, I did have to ask a few times for water and drinks. Parking was easy and the bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and some of the highest quality in the Las Vegas area. Definitely my number #1 in town! Blue Fin Tuna from Spain all day! Yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic for an off the strip sushi restaurant. It's small but the Service was fantastic. We had the fried tofu, tempura and teriyaki red snapper was great. Our five year old eat everything and she is super picky. We highly recommend it for affordable and tasty sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! I love happy hour, because every hour is a happy hour when I am eating YUMMY SUSHI! haha. They do have a good happy hour though. Blue fin tuna is amazing, all the sushi chefs know what they are doing, and the fish is quality. It is not a big place, but it is cozy and the service is really great. I will travel out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  First impression when we walked in and looking at the menu it seemed like any other sushi joint.  But if you take a closer look, the type of fish selection tells you a different story.  They offer blue fin tuna, to king salmon, live uni... We sat at the bar.  We ordered the medium sashimi; blue fin tuna, king salmon, and live uni nigiri with a special roll.  During our experience we found out they had omakase by reservation only next door (which we are excited about trying next time).  This place is by far my favorite sushi place in Vegas to date.    The ambiance of the place itself was below average.  But What I really enjoyed was the chef preparing our order.  You can tell when someone takes pride in their work.  This chef has a smile in his eyes when he's creating his art work.  The way he described which part of the fish we are trying, to training his apprentices, is very meticulous.  Attention to detail is at a very high level.  We really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"My brother in law and I went to there. It was delicious and good! I love it next time we will go again:)   You need try go to there jaja"}
{"text":"I've been to many sushi restaurants around the world and this one made me feel like I was back in the hidden alleys within Japan. Great traditional atmosphere, extensive drink menu, and with the most diverse largest sushi menu. The preparation, turnaround time, and overall quality is the best I've ever seen. The taste was just amazing of everything we tried. By far the best sushi in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night for dinner. It's In a strip mall on lake mead . From the outside it looks like a cheap Chinese restaurant with all the led signs. Had second thought for minute but gave it a try anyway.  Got inside the door and again the inside looks like a cheap Chinese restaurant the decor is horrendous hard wooden chairs. Common you can do better than that!  On the sushi side the food was really good    Fish was fresh and was not drowned in sauce. Three stars are only for the food. Decor gets zero in my book.  I would only stop in if I was in the area for a quick meal, definitely would not take a date there!"}
{"text":"This place has become my spot for sushi. A local or visiting, a must. I can go as far to say it may be better than some omasake places . Love the sushi chefs - always recommends the best. If it's good, they'll tell you. If not, they'll give you an alternative choice."}
{"text":"After 11 years, I have FINALLY found the sushi I've been looking for! Being from LA, I was raised on amazing Japanese style sushi. Yummy has it!!! I was told to try Yummy by a friend and I am so happy I did! Amazing, fresh fish from all over the world! Chef Forest was amazing and the owner is truly the nicest guy! What a wonderful experience! I will be back.... Many times!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are sushi-lovers, so when we were in Vegas for the holiday weekend, I looked up a place here on Yelp. This one has good reviews so we decided to give it a try. We could not have been more pleased! We called ahead to reserve a table. When we walked in, I gave them our name, and the hostess led us right to a table with a \"reserved\" sign on it! Talk about VIP treatment!  We ordered the edamame while we looked over the menu. The edamame came out steaming hot with lots of salt..perfect! There were over 50 specialty rolls on the menu. We ordered the Ex-girlfriend and Ichiban, since they sounded good. Then we asked the server for a recommendation. She said if we like coconut, we should try the Paradise roll. So we ordered that too! The rolls came out in good timing. All were delicious, and we loved the Paradise roll! We never had anything like it!! Yum!  So if you like unique specialty rolls, definitely worth trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch looking for an open sushi place and pretty glad we made the trip (a closer restaurant had a much lower review which deterred us from going there). The staff were incredibly helpful and attentive. I never had an empty glass (a HUGE pet peeve of mine when it take forever for a refill). We even got a complimentary appetizer (crab pancake? So good). Everything was absolutely delicious. The waiter helped us catch deals on the menu with items we were already ordering. Little pricey but we all left happy and full. I'd recommend this place to anyone I knew staying off strip in Vegas."}
{"text":"Got a free large bottle of hot sake!!!   I absolutely adore it here. The sushi is fresher than fresh, comes out quickly and the staff is fantastically friendly. They provide you with a savory pancake as an complimentary appetizer, the gyoza is some of the best I've ever had and after the meal, there's a fresh slice of orange with your name on it!  We continue to come back here because it never lets us down. It's definitely one of our favorites in the entire city!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last two years to eat meat jun. Lots of staff so they were pretty on it in terms of service. Large portion of food and it was good. If it wasn't on the opposite side of where I reside, I'd go more often."}
{"text":"We had previously gotten boba tea at the No. 1 Boba Tea next door and were on the hunt for some good fried rice, not aware of this restaurant.  However, using Yelp to guide our way we decided to try it, having to wait 30 minutes for it to open. It was worth the wait. The shrimp fried rice was some of the best I've had. It contained plenty of plump, tasty shrimp and the least-greasy rice I've seen. We also had an order of chicken katsu. It, too, was tasty and not at all greasy. Prices were good and portions were plentiful."}
{"text":"1 star for not having the special that's advertised on Yelp.  It's Sunday, and there's no 50% off sushi special."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi I have had in Vegas, the quality is amazing but lately this hidden gem has been getting so packed. It's not an AYCE but it's deft worth it, the strawberry Nigori is my fav saki and pretty much every roll is prepared amazing and not lacking any flavor or skimps on fish, if I could eat here everyday I would, going back to try out happy hour."}
{"text":"For years Yummy grill has been a go-to dinner spot for my family and I! Their won ton soup and their yummy soup are perfect for cold nights or whenever you may be feeling under the weather! Their lunch specials are great as well, they have a good selection and they give a LOT for the price!  I personally always get the Teriyaki Beef Bowl whenever I come here along with a few sushi rolls but lately I've noticed that they have started to hold back on their portion size with the bowls, giving way more rice than meat! Regardless, Yummy Grill Sushi is a great spot with a good variety and selection of food! Their servers are extremely nice and attentive as well if dining in restaurant. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So yummy! my definite go to spot when I'm in Vegas! very fresh cuts of fish and generous portions of fish to rice ratio. presentation was also very nice. i cant wait to go back, its the kind of place where you feel like your at a family members house and are very welcome to be there."}
{"text":"Real wassabe..... love this place.. great service and great sushi..."}
{"text":"Walked in during my lunch break and only waited 5 minutes to be seated at a table. I let the server, Aaron, know that I was on a time limit and he was very accommodating. The salmon teriyaki combination box I ordered came out in a timely manner and everything tasted great! Prices are very reasonable. Next time I'll be back to try their AYCE :)"}
{"text":"I've always had great service with equally great food. I never really enjoyed anything spicy or hot until I had their Kiss of Fire rolls - OMG. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Tried calling for 20 minutes. No ones ever answered. It was 6-630 on a Thursday night. Finally gave up and went to sushi hero. Never got a chance to try the food since they won't pick up the phone, but 1 star for lack of customer service!"}
{"text":"I will be brief, but let me start by relating this: This may have been best sushi experience I have ever had.  I met up with my friend Javi for his late & late night birthday celebration and, since he had just won playing poker, he told me dinner was on him since my birthday was before his. SCH-WEET.  The night's highlights: - We saw Misti & Bobby! (Thanks for the first sake shots!) - Live Scallop (Again, thanks Bobby) - Live Uni (I really didn't want to try this, but Javi applied adventurous peer pressure) - Spicy Albacore w/ fried onions (I mentioned it, Eric just whipped it up and gave us a 4 piece sample, gratis) - Garlic Edamame  - Spicy Tuna roll(s) - Eric bought us a bottle of sake (Javi & I sorta celebrating birthdays) - Yelp check in for a free bottle of sake - Patrons at the bar tend to share food - Eric FTW!  The reviews of Yummy Grill speak for themselves.  I can't imagine that I am adding much to the body of knowledge that is their review history.    My bottom line:  Yummy Grill is now my \"Go To\" for sushi & late night dining on my own side of town.  Every time I have come here, it is more than just dining, it is an experience.  Their \"Reverse Happy Hour\" starts at 10pm & goes until close.  BTW, the staff have amazing memories.  Amazing.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place!  Everyone is so friendly.   Took my family here for lunch and sat at the bar.  We wanted for nothing.  So attentive. Pleasant. Thorough.  Food was great. They brought us fun things to try!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was horrible. We were there for almost an hour & a half. Staff is friendly but super super slow."}
{"text":"Yum Yum went my Tum Tum after my second visit to this great little sushi house near Summerlin.  If you decide to show up on a weekend I do recommend a reservation!   It's a tiny place and it fills up quick.  (Nicolas Cage has been seen here!)  I was really super happy to see another family with kids here so I was not ruining a date night!  The kids menu offers a choice between chicken or beef teriyaki, rice, one California roll and miso soup.    Noodle bowls were a big hit with our group as was the tempura and a few sushi rolls. The Diablo roll was topped with some jalapenos and spicy sauce was served on the side.This was my favorite and I'll be back for more.  Fabulous friendly service and a $10 Yelp discount when you check in (if you spend over a certain amount)."}
{"text":"My love for sushi is always tragic.  I crave really fresh ingredients from exotic places, I submit to science in muscle rebuilding theory with protein from all you can eat sushi (nigiri), or pretend to fancy a sushi chefs creative artistry in their specialized rolls.  A word about being open minded, my first visit many moons ago was my first review, it was filled with \"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens, brown paper packages tied up with strings...\"   As I kept returning, even for a short one hour work lunch break, the owner/chef would ask how I was doing.  I would act normal and pretend not to be excited with my replies.  They were always something along the lines of me being in the area and they're open late so it's convenient but Chef Eric is a smart man and can see that I am grinning inside for the fresh items posted on the white board outside.  I am one of many returning customers but the question that is hard to ask of a sushi place is, \"Is what you see, what you really get? \" The answer can be shown to you and they are proud to showcase it.  Live shrimp and live uni still living in their shells, fish like last nights flown in from places such as Tokyo.  Chef puts a lot of effort into finding and purchasing these fresh items for us, those of us who really know sushi.  I say that because they serve the western sushi eaters as well.  My first dish ever in Yummy Sushi was a roll.  Most rolls are good and you can find one which would be perfect for you, the people who sat next to me during my second to last visit ordered the same ahi tuna roll three times.  The party of eight in the back of the room kept ordering rolls after rolls.  The chefs here really exceed in skills and knowledge because they focus on being fruitful rather than being paid employees.  Every time I order the live shrimp I see one of the main sushi chefs work on carefully cleaning and prepping my live sweet shrimp.  He could have made two sushi rolls within that time or sent the shrimp to the back to be made but no shortcuts here.  Have an open mind and sit around a revolution: chefs not from Japan or China, whichever you consider where Sushi originated from, making your sushi; welcome diners who want to enjoy their \"sushi (aka Rolls)\" and yum yum sauce; and especially being in a non AYCE establishment.  Again, don't be fooled by the western influenced menu (just look at the many sushi rolls), there are off menu dishes for those of us who know what to really look for in sushi.  There wouldn't be off menu dishes or delicate sashimi if these sushi chefs did not have the skills to create it.    Friends with sushi benefits, I would not sit anywhere else other than the counter or sushi bar, I would suggest you do the same.  Ask for fresh wasabi if it compliments your sushi.  The non all you can eat practice hurts my muscles but the fresh sushi warms my heart.  Look at the white board outside, look at the white board inside the restaurant to see what they have in fresh and give them a try!  And to finish the lyrics in my intro \"...These are a few of my favorite things\" (Sound of Music), that is why i continue to come here."}
{"text":"Come here often and always get the teriyaki combination, comes with sushi and miso soup for $10. Can't beat that deal."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place close by my house. Wish they had a gluten-free menu and more options. But they're delicious!"}
{"text":"Took advantage of their bento box style lunch special with dad. I would probably need to go in and have real sushi dinner to write a more serious review.   They served us a complimentary amuse bouche of Korean pancakes. That was nice!   I got the bulgogi lunch combo with California roll, miso soup, salad, rice, and 4 pieces veggie and shrimp tempura. It was a ton of food! We packed up half to take home.   The lunch specials are priced $11-13.50. A little high for a lunch special but not for the amount of food. I would have prefered an $8 lunch special that I could eat all in one sitting. $36 for two is a bit much for bento boxes.   Food was good though! No complaints."}
{"text":"Wow. Best sushi I've had in ages, and that's saying a lot for someone who doesn't usually order seafood anywhere other than the west coast. After having a total bust with finding gluten-free options at two other sushi places nearby we called Yummy, and they were accommodating, knowledgable and careful to avoid cross-contamination. Very, very impressed (and full)!"}
{"text":"Order from the fresh fish selections on the board.  Tried the Alaskan king salmon sashimi and it was great, best king since I moved back to lower 48!  Seaweed salad was also on point.  All around the meal was nicely done and attentive service, thanks!"}
{"text":"I'll give Yummy Sushi (Lake Mead location) 4 stars for now. Giving a strong rating mainly because I am a fan of their Henderson location.  This is my first visit to this location and still have yet a lot to try here.    Was in the area and Stephanie S. invited me over for some sushi. Because I just had In-N-Out two hours earlier, I didn't eat much just their yellow tail nigiri, tuna nigiri, and a shrimp tempura hand roll.  All weren't that bad, but was a little skeptical with the yellowtail since I'm use to them having a lighter color to them.  I also thought that both nigiri's were small compared to the Henderson location.    This location is smaller and busier than the Henderson location. This location is also closer to me so I see myself coming back.  I still have my favorites from the other location like their shashimi, halibut, and even their Loco Moco. I'm looking forward to try them at this location."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner here. It is a bit more expensive than other places, but it's worth it for fresh sushi. I also had a bowl of miso soup which was delicious. We'll be back soon to test out happy hour."}
{"text":"First of all, I must say upfront that even though I am Asian, I do not care for rice and don't eat sushi. I do however LOVE Sashimi and other Japanese dishes.   On of my co-workers told us about this little hidden gem and we opted to go for the late night Happy Hour (after 10pm)  one evening after work. We were able to call ahead and reserve seats at the Sushi bar and were promptly seated as soon as we arrived.  First up: Endamame .. the server offered the standard version with salt, or the \"garlic\" version. We got the garlic and it was delicious. Just the right amount of saltiness, garlic with a touch of spiciness from the sweet chili sauce. So good and we'll definitely be ordering this again! Another hit, surprisingly, was the Popcorn Scallops. Though the morsels of scallops are rather small, the sauce (kind of an orangy and spicy blend) is delish. We ordered a second round of this one. .  The sushi chef recommended several items from their menu board of specials. The Japanese Yellowtail was super fresh and tasty. I would have preferred thinner slices and will remember to request that they do that the next time.   My co-workers' favorite in terms of Sushi and rolls was the Kiss of Fire Roll,  with spicy soft shell crab, cucumber, shrimp tempura on the inside and spicy soft shell crab, yellowtail, spicy ponzu, spicy and eel sauce on the outside.   We also tried the Sake Sampler and though I am not huge on Sake .. the Apple flavored one was quite yummy and something I could drink .. it reminded me of a Jolly Rancher but in liquid form ;)   The guests seated next to us at the bar were ordering their rolls and sushi with brown rice, a nice option that this venue offers. The happy hour pricing is reasonable, and the food is tasty. Be sure to call ahead if you want to sit at the sushi bar or if you have a larger party as they attract a nice-sized crowd for the late hour."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered delivery. Hr &a half went by & place is 10mins away. Still no answered. Charged by card & still waiting on my $30$  worth of sushi . No stars if I could!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Possibly some of the freshest Sushi I've eaten in Las Vegas.. I tried the Blue Fin Toro, Blue Fin nigiri, Unagi, Hawaiian Roll, and a couple others I can't remember.. Everything was delicious and the staff was beyond friendly.. I can't wait to visit them again and sample some more tasty Sushi!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The employees are what makes this place amazing. They are very attentive and explain everything on the menu. One of the only places In Vegas where I can find fresh fish ( when I mean fresh it's killed there right before they prep your food). The baked muscles are out of this world."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place. I love the service & the food is just yummy. Can't wait to come back & we will"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times previously.  This place was ok previously, but whatever changed... now its not so good.   My wife and kids used to like the meat jun.  But this past trip it was not so good.  Meat was stringy and not quite so tender.  Also the meat jun sauce seemed like teriyaki with oil on top.  Not your typical vinegar shoyu sort of sauce.  Seafood Combo was ok.  I didn't care for the egg-battered fish.  It just seemed so amateur.  A panko crusted or just flour would have been better.  Supposedly it was mahi-mahi... but it either wasn't, or was very old.  The pieces were very thin.  In any case, it wasn't very tasty.  And the packet tarter sauce provided was unappealing as well.  The shrimp tempura was ok, but I kinda feel like it was the frozen stuff from Costco.  Also no tempura sauce... WTH?  They gave a teriyaki sauce only.  The grilled shrimp ok as well, nothing special.    My next comment is not a gripe, but an observation... WTF is with all the salad on the plate?  I had salad, which was ok, but the fish (kinda small in quantity) sat atop a mountain of cabbage!  I like salad, so like I said its not a complaint, but damn it was a lot of green.  Now to the really bad part... The salmon sushi we had was terrible.  The menu picture shows the salmon wrapping all around, not just the top.  This was not the case when receiving our sushi.  Also the salmon tasted old and fishy... It was also slimy which is another sign of being old.  I had one piece, and could not bring myself to eat another.  My kids seemed to like it, but they don't know any better.  Service was ok despite all the other yelp reviews saying it was terrible.  I don't know that I want to return here anytime soon.  I will probably just sit back and watch other yelp reviews before giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Everything about sushi yummy is excellent. Staff is nice very interactive with us sitting here at the bar. The sushi chefs really take pride in their craft and the food is great! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Eric is the best chef!! He's so cool... wonderful experience and awesome food!!!! Everything was amazing, fresh, great staff.... 6 stars!!!!.... one of the best sashimi I had in a long time... thanks Eric and the staff!"}
{"text":"The Yummy Grill & Sushi on Lake Mead Blvd has constantly been reputed to be one of the best sushi places in Las Vegas. Despite being located in a nondescript plaza, I think it lives up to the billing.  It's taken me a long time to venture out here, and I'm glad that I finally did. I arrived rather late during the late night happy hour (daily 10pm until closing, also Sun-Thu 4-6pm) determined to put them to the test. Unfortunately, they had run out of live sushi entirely. As my friend (a regular whose name was remembered by one of the chefs) and as many reviewers can attest, I clearly missed out on something that might have been truly special. I'll strive to arrive earlier next time.  Regardless of that initial disappointment, we were able to dine on a variety of sushi, many of which were at happy hour prices. The happy hour menu is a double-sided sheet that you actually use to make your order by marking desired quantities and presenting it to the server (even if sitting at the bar, as we were), The fish that I'm about to list were all nigiri, and they all come at two pieces per order.  - Garlic Edamame ($3.50): didn't care for it too much. It's actually spicy and not just garlicky. - Octopus ($3.50): tasty, juicy, dabbed with a bit of soy sauce. Simplicity at its best. - Kanpachi, subbed for Japanese yellowtail ($3.75): kanpachi is one of the more premium items normally, but either an oversight or an undercharge led to us paying that price. It is definitely more delicious than the other place where I've eaten it. - Super White Tuna ($3.75): topped with a dab of a chili sauce, which didn't really mask the natural fish flavor. Generous fish portion and more flavorful than most of the times that I've had it elsewhere. - Japanese Sea Scallop ($3.75): juicy scallop, definitely not the \"bay scallop\" variety that some places use as a cheap substitute. I'd order it again. - Big Eye Tuna, aka Ahi ($4.50): this had a bit of an odd flavor for some reason. Maybe it was the sushi vinegar hitting my tongue? I didn't care for this as much as I'd hoped. - Blue Fin ($8.50): good flavor and texture, but felt like a marginal improvement over standard tuna. I was hesitant at this price and would probably shy away next time. - Toro ($17.75): so nice that we ordered it twice. Fatty tuna is one of the holy grails of sushi, and this is probably the best toro preparation that I've had in my rather limited experience. They actually cut this from the fatty collar area instead of the belly, and they add a bit of caviar and edible gold leaf to complete the luxurious presentation. It almost melts in the mouth, but it's actually preferable (to me anyway) to savor the flavor for longer than if it had truly melted, as some traditional o-toro from the belly tends to do. Price be damned, it's an absolute must-order here. - Uni ($14.75): a little disappointing in that they added the kama toro, some ikura, fresh wasabi, and one or two other components that diluted the uni. I would've liked to taste the unadulterated uni, especially given that it was reportedly sourced from Japan instead of Santa Barbara. - Surf Clam ($2.75): subbed out properly for the conch, which was unavailable. Great texture, not too chewy, but again a bit more subtle in flavoring. - Sweet Shrimp ($6.50): the tail nigiri was certainly some of the better amaebi that I've had, and they provide a special dipping sauce for it. The deep fried head was perhaps subtly tastier with less possibly offputting flavors. - Spanish Mackerel ($6.00): the flavor was surprisingly not so intense. They ran out of normal mackarel, which I would have liked to taste for comparison's sake. I had a mackerel sashimi once that somehow tasted sublime, and this didn't live up to that memory. - Orange slices (complimentary): I can't help but love free dessert, and I'm glad that every slice was sweet.  Service and sushi preparation were both brisk and attentive. The server cleared empty plates promptly, refilled drinks often, brought out water for my friend when he simply requested a halt to his soda refills (complimentary), and brought out napkins toward the end (perhaps to help with the potentially leaky orange slices). The chefs handed plates to us one at a time.  The bill came out to about $50 a person before tax/tip (for the number crunchers, we each had 1 piece for the most part). It was a solid value for quality fish all around, especially considering that the toro accounted for most of the cost (justifiably so). I'd definitely go back to try to get my chopsticks on the live sushi, and maybe I'll even try the omakase when I'm feeling especially splurgy. Don't confuse this Yummy Grill & Sushi with any of the other locations that may still exist around Las Vegas / Henderson - you have to make the trip out here at least once if you're a sushi fan."}
{"text":"You gotta get Yummy in your Belly!!!  I'm going to piggyback every other review in echoing the awesomeness that is Yummy Grill & Sushi. This has a great extensive menu that can compete with any other sushi bar in Las Vegas.  Going in for a late lunch I ordered the teriyaki box with a miso soup and edamame. Also was served a small side of complementary pancake slices before my main meal came.  Straight from the start, everything that was put out in front of me was top shelf. Everything was cooked to perfection. The service was great with the chefs and servers being very polite and personable.  Then why only 4 stars you might ask. Well even though my experience was all 5 star, I realized after speaking with the chef that the fish dishes were the speciality!! Kinda of on me because didn't read the reviews all the way through. So I'm planning to go back real soon to experience what I missed out on.  Overall Food: 5-5 Drink:  4-5 Service: 5-5 Coming back: for sure"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Quick and clean!  Also have delivery!  The won ton soup is delicious!  Dragon Roll is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I ate here the other night with my hubby, and it was all in all pretty good. The only thing that may have been a little disappointing was that the food took a while and service was a little slow. However, that probably had a lot to do with the chef training a new guy on how to make sushi and him also dealing with a disturbance outside which forced him to call security.  Minor things aside, Chef was very nice and attentive and ended up giving us complimentary edamame to keep our tummies from growling too much. I would definitely come back and give it another try."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon a little after 11 am with my family.  The inside of this place is fairly small and a little dark, but is kept clean and neat.  We were warmly greeted by the host/server and sat at a table right away.  There was already one other table seated as well, but other than that the place was empty.  Our order was taken promptly and our drinks were brought out right away.  We did notice that the wait for our food did take awhile to come out even though there were only us and the one other occupied table.  However, there was only one sushi chef working and a couple of to go orders called in so that could contribute to the wait time for the food.     Our table ordered the Miso Soup $2, Seaweed Salad $5, Dynamite Roll $10.50, Kamikaze Roll $10.50, Lisa Roll $9, Spider Man Roll $11, Kalbi Box Dinner $18, and a soda $2, all for a grand total of $66.74, which includes the 10% discount offered for Yelp check-ins.  Just to note this place is not all you can eat and no lunch specials on Sunday.  The food was decent, but nothing spectacular or nothing worth remembering.  The rolls were a little heavy on the sauce and fixings in my opinion.  Overall this place wasn't terrible, but I just wouldn't come here again especially with all the other great sushi restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Asked for a simple teriyaki plate and didn't end up getting it?! Then while I was trying to get their attention for the correction, I ended up getting attitude! It wasn't my mistake it was theirs' and I was even nice about fixing the problem too! Telling them that I could pay for it if it was a mistake or wait if it was necessary. Complete and utter crap. After the confrontation they started talking crap about me in Korean! I understand Korean!! Unprofessional and horrible."}
{"text":"I had a late work out at Golds Gym on W. Lake Mead & looked on Yelp for a late night sushi spot to feed these hungry muscles. I found Yummy Sushi and so awesome for me it was in the next shoping complex east of the gym. I was very impressed! Very happy place small & packed but well arranged. I sat at the sushi bar and since I came after 10pm I ordered happy hour items which are good until closing at 1pm. I loved it all my items were good but I really loved the Cajun Albacore. They gave me free little pancake appetizers, a crab & cucumber salad and a nice orange slice for dessert. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I made it a point to drive out here for dinner after seeing the solid reviews on Yelp.  The prices are reasonable and the sashimi here is fresh. I ordered Edamame for starters, the 16 piece combo sashimi and a spicy tuna hand roll.   Overall I was happy with everything I ate although the place is small and can get loud when there is a large party which I happened to encounter.  Service was friendly and another con is it's a distance from the strip."}
{"text":"This is one of those rare places that offer fresh live sushi that I cannot find any where in California. I was so happy to have found this place from the reviews. The restaurant although is very tiny, the foods and services more than made up for the size. It's the best sushi restaurant for the price I have ever been to. The service is amazing. The chef is very friendly and caring. Servers were so much nicer and more genuine than those at 5 stars restaurants. It's like a hidden gem in the middle of Vegas. I've tasted miso soups at various restaurants and I find this place has the most balanced taste in miso soups. I just can't get my mind off their foods and still fantasize about Yummy Grill Sushi when I am back to california. Whenever they are busy, they always try to make it up by giving out free salads, free cakes, and ice cream. I have never been treated so well any where else . The chef is authentic Japanese so you know it's not one of those confused chef that is lost between several ethnicities of taste. IT's real authentic Japanese foods. The kid's meal in very tasty as well. Grilled salmon has no weird funky fish smell and grill beef were marinated to perfection. It's one of those restaurants that you can't describe until you give it a try. I am so glad I took a chance. Thank you for a wonderful experience . We will be sure to share and recommend with all our friends and families who are visiting or living in the area."}
{"text":"We order for pick-up most of the time. They are close to home and quick...They have a spam and egg musubi that i dip in ketchup -YUM!-They have gone up in price a little but the food sure hits the stop when you are hungry and too tired to cook!! The Barbeque is never marinated enough to my liking... But everything else is good. The chinese food is good as well...We love their orange beef  and honey walnut shrimp but I tell them to go light on the sauce or your food will be swimming in it. I love love love their crab seafood salad which they took off the menu about 2 yrs. ago but still make it when I ask ...they should put it back on the menu."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi is by far one of the best local sushi places. I moved away from Vegas but make it a point to visit every time I return to town. Even if you order to go, it's still tasty and fresh. My favorite rolls are Kiss of Fire/American/PlayBoy/Ban Ban. Oh and if you don't want sushi, their Chicken Fried Rice is just yummy!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately Yummy Sushi was not so yummy.  I ordered a baked California roll with brown rice and it came smothered with an avalanche amount of \"yummy sauce\", which is soy and mayo.  I'm on a pretty strict diet and I don't do dairy, so when I sank my teeth into the baked Cali roll I was completely grossed out.  It would've not been such a big deal if it was a tiny amount of sauce, but unfortunately it was just swimming in it.  So I requested that they make another one without the sauce and they said they couldn't so I opted for a regular Cali roll and this simple request became a small nightmare.  It took 20 minutes to get that out then they couldn't find my order. Then they packed it up to go and by then I lost my appetite. So basically I ended up paying $22 for a few Cali rolls and miso soup and it just was not worth it.  In all honesty I've had much better experiences in food and service at other sushi places and I think I'll just stick to those. At this point I'm not really thrilled about this place and I don't think I'll be coming back.  Sorry dudes, but it's a no for me."}
{"text":"First of all, Let Me Just Say that I Love this Place... I will be honest and say there were a couple of times where I was disappointed, but for the most part It was Pleasant. The eatery itself is a little small, but there are covered tables outside of the establishment for those Beautiful Vegas Days. There are about 6 or 7 Tables inside, as well as Bench Seating.   Each time I go here, I Always get something different. And each time I always get it Hot, and Quite Fast. I've had everything from their Shrimp Tempura Udon, Meat Jun, Spam Saimin, and of course their various Sushi rolls. Each Time it has been very tasty & I have left feeling full, and happy!  The service has been very good, they always ask me if I need anything, or they refill my water."}
{"text":"Yummy Sushi has some of the best sushi in town. If you are hungry for a variety of fresh fish this is the place to go. They post what fresh fish comes in on their Facebook page."}
{"text":"all time favorite sushi bar in las vegas. Everything is extremely fresh and the chefs are hard working and very talented. This place can get busy! But I never mind waiting because it's WORTH it. Eric lives and breathes sushi. Everyone takes excellent care of the establishment and the guests. I highly recommend yummy grill to anyone looking to eat delectable, well priced sushi, made by professionals. I love sitting by the bar because the chefs are very friendly and knowledgeable.  thank you for your dedication and always welcoming us!"}
{"text":"I just ordered take out because I was close. I was charged for a roll I didn't order; when I pointed this out the woman ringing me out INSISTED I'd order it. I politely insisted I had not; she turned & walked away to the prep area. She began speaking in her native language to the others standing there; all I could make out was \"Volcano Roll\" (which I hadn't ordered). She returned to cash me out but would not look at or speak to me. I paid, thanked her & wished her a good day; I got absolute silence. I haven't tasted my food but I know I won't be back. I work too hard for my $$$ to give it to people that behave that way."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Las Vegas!!  They always have great specials, amazing rolls and delicious drinks. Do not miss this hidden gem. Their late night happy hour specials can't be beat!!!"}
{"text":"Came in around 10pm for happy hour. All the rolls were under 5$ they were delicious and the sushi chiefs were all very friendly. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"This place was one of my regular eateries. Not anymore. Lately my orders have been wrong and the food seems its been just thrown together. Don't order anything salmon because youll end up with less than 3 oz of salmon. So disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our kids here and they were a little anxious and loud. One of the waitresses brought over some shaved ice for them, with a smile and no charge. I understand kids can be annoying but she was very kind. Yummy has the best salmon skin handroll and good service."}
{"text":"Another check of our list of places for Sahimi. We had the owner serve us, which was a pleasure. His vast knowledge of fish and seafood is unlimited it seems. Had the Bluefin sahimi (excellent), Kanpachi, and variety of other sushi menu items. Really loved the experience and freshness of the choices we made. Excited for our next visit!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Grill is quite convenient for lunch. If you want some quick and simple sushi rolls, this is the place to go. I can't say how their fish quality is since I'm only able to eat the cooked stuff for now, but the Cali Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll definitely does it job in fulfilling my lunch craving. I actually tried the fried rice there one day and it wasn't bad at all, just your typical American-Chinese style fried rice. Service is fairly quick and the cashier is always nice. If you want fast Japanese/Chinese food, this is the place to go. Prices aren't too shabby either."}
{"text":"I went to this place today for the first time, I had read the reviews and decided to give it a try! I was there for lunch time around 1:00pm my experience was not that great! I waited 20 minutes just for them to bring out a cup of tea! Another 20 minutes for the sushi to come out!!! The fish looked beautiful but it was way too over priced! I don't think I will go back again, I don't mind paying for good fish but I do mind just waiting even for drinks, for the kind of money they charge their service should be top notch. I get better service at all you can eat places and their fish is good quality just not as pretty presentation!  Not worth the money"}
{"text":"We come here for one item only all the time which they do well, spam saimin. It's simple and delicious like how Hawaii serves it. It has fried spam sliced and garnished with kamaboku and fresh green onions. The soup is better than S & S. Service is always nice and fast."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi joint ever! It is NOT AYCE but it is well worth eating here!   You should defiantly get their oysters! I don't remember which one I ate, it was small but super delicious with flavor! I never had such an awesome oyster before!   The bill racks up if you order a lot!   Everything is fresh. My husband ordered the uni bowl. Super fresh! They cut it right in front of you. I'm not a  uni fan but I know it was well worth it."}
{"text":"MY GF and I were recommended to eat here so, for our Girls Day Out, we decided to check it out!   We went on a Wednesday afternoon, the parking lot was not busy at all. Their specials for lunch were OK, I have to come back for a visit for HH. The food was pretty good though. ONLY IF I COULD REMEMBER THE NAMES! There's one roll named, something like \"Tastes like my ex-girlfriend\"... LOL we had a laugh about the name and had to try it out because of it lol.   Again, I have to say, I have to come back for HH, HH specials look real good!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish.  Services was a bit slow to start, but once the rolls started coming and the sushi the wait was worth it!  Salmon was particularly creamy.  Arizona roll was a little spicy, but the kick was delayed, and the yellowtail was very tasty."}
{"text":"Yummy Grill & Sushi surprised me... for a few reasons..  The name for one, since a name like Yummy grill & sushi would have caused me to run away in my local homeyelptown.  But this place is awesome, like me and the BF were saying that Toronto needs a Yummy Grill & Sushi bar.   They offer fresh sashimi, and they specialize in rolls, as well as deep fried or baked rolls on top of everything else they offer. They seem to like the ponzu soy sauce quite a bit too, but it's not a bad thing.  Their roll names are pretty fanciful, such as Sex on the Beach (really good, I recommend), My Ex-Girlfriend, Romeo.. I know it sounds odd, but I almost burst out laughing when I heard a kid ask the waiter if he could have an orgasm roll... but it's good to know that they take their sushi rolls seriously.   Their menu is fairly easy to navigate, we ordered their clam miso soup, which was meaty came loaded with clams, which added a nice meaty-ness depth to the miso soup, good value for $3.50  We started off with a Joy, bam-bam, and finished with the Sex on the Beach roll, all of which were fresh and extremely flavourful without being too much of one thing or another, you were able to taste everything they had put in to the roll and it wasn't too overly stuffed.  Another thing they have that i haven't seen anywhere else, was their flavoured-sake--- this stuff is good.  We ordered their sake sampler $7 for 3 decent sized glasses of sake, we were able to try fuji apple, plum and raspberry. I definitely liked their fuiji Apple one the best, and the BF liked the plum. The sake tasted like sake, but you get the aroma and the taste of the fruit at the same time, quite enjoyable and a steal $7. They, also, sell sparking sake too; which I didn't see until too late, but that is for next time...  Their black sesame ice cream is quite good, and isn't too sweet either. Perfect ending to pretty note-perfect meal.  Service is good and attentive."}
{"text":"First off, I'm fairly new to sushi and for me it's all about the texture. With that being said, I can only critique the rolls which I ordered bc I still havent acclimated myself to the raw stuff lol!  We tried the shrimp tempura roll, California roll and gyoza. The shrimp tempura roll was just ok, I liked the shrimp but the flakes weren't my favorite. But you really can't mess up a shrimp roll! LOL. The Cali roll is very typical, and def filling. The gyoza was also pretty tasty!  We also had mochi, which I wasn't a fan of... Again this is something I'm not used to but it's worth a try!  The space here is itty bitty, and the customer service is ok. It's best to sit at the bar if you're impatient!  Yay!"}
{"text":"We literally eat here once a week.  The sushi is delicious and they have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years, food never ever disappoints. I especially love their fried rice and Japanese lasagna. Dining area is clean and well decorated. The kitchen is open so you can see them make the food and roll the sushi in front of you. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi in Las Vegas. You won't be disappointed. I can remember when there were only 4 sushi places in town. I'm a former Manda Sushi (now closed) lover and had such a hard time finding a place that came close to them. I found it..... I love this place. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! All the fish was fresh my favorite was the toro nigiri so fatty!! Everything was great,  The reason I am giving Yummy 3 stars is due to the horrible service I mean horrible.  I would love to come back and enjoy the food but the servers are so inexperienced its ridiculous and frustrating."}
{"text":"I always love it when I walk into a \"hole-in-the-wall\" only to find it COMPLETELY PACKED!! This place was recommended to me by a friend and man oh man, was she ever right!! Great sushi/ (inventive rolls) that's fast with both efficient and courteous service. A wonderfully unexpected surprise and although it's a bit out of the way for me, I know that I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place. I try different things all the time, and i have liked everything thus far. Only suggestion would be, getting a bigger location because dinner time gets pretty full. Try the combination chow mein!!!"}
{"text":"I checked into this place on my 4 year anniversary with the boyfriend. It was my first time checking out the place. The place was packed on a monday, but we got a table. Service was really slow. We didn't even get to order drinks for 10 minutes.  We ordered our food, but it took too long so we just paid for the drinks and left. Before us at the cashier was a man who paid his bill but left unhappy. We left the place unhappy and starving. We had to leave anyways because we had a Vegas show to attend to, and the slow service had us running late.  I think you have to be really patient to fully enjoy this place, but so far the wait time to be served didn't impress me."}
{"text":"We took the advice of some friend and Nelson Q to try this place.  They have an incredible roll menu with funny names.  You have to wonder how some of these were named.   The rolls really make this place good for those queezy about raw fish.  Non-Asians will find this place a good place to eat with the diverse menu.  What I like about this place is they don't over-greet with a loud cheer in Japanese like most other sushi joints.  They do acknowledge your arrival and departure more discretely."}
{"text":"I usually go to my normal sushi spot at Soho but they were closed today. So I decided to try a new place that friends have recommended. I was also so excited to try this place based on the great Yelp reviews. I'm a huge Uni fan and when they advertised live fresh uni, I knew I had to try this place.  Food tasted great, everything was fresh.  I was upset they didn't have fresh uni. I would have gave this place 5 stars if service was better. It wasn't really busy. I came in around 3pm on a Sunday. There were only two other tables occupied. We sat around for 10 minutes waiting to get  the check and we even had  our cards out ready to pay. They took so long to come back to get our payment. I even timed it, 6 minutes for the server to come back and grab the check book. Both servers walked by our table at least 3-4 during this 6 minutes and still failed to notice that we were ready to pay and leave. There's no sense of urgency with service at this place."}
{"text":"I had the California roll, Spicy Crab roll, and Chicken Teriyaki.  It was awesome. Had tons of flavor.  The oranges they gave after the meal were even awesome.  They were cold and sweet.  Definitely do recommend."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here... the food is always good... service very efficient and nice (been in the service industry over 20 years).  To go orders are always quick and everything is hot and tasty when i get it home.  Food here always reminds me of home... especially the Meat Jun."}
{"text":"First time here. We were pleasantly surprised of the quality of the food and the service was outstanding! Everything was delicious !"}
{"text":"I could never dine at a sushi place in Vegas without consulting Yelp first. And of course, it came in handy.  The restaurant is fairly small and more rundown, so I kind of saw it as one of those hole-in-the-walls that is a gem to discover.  The staff is super nice, no doubt. The menu is easy to understand, although there aren't any pictures. All of our food was delicious (we ordered 3 sushi rolls and a box combo). My first two rolls (Playboll and Vanessa) were very tasty. But I didn't care for my last roll (Sex On The Beach).  I also thought it was cute how they give you a complimentary appetizer for the beginning of your meal and small slices of oranges at the end. I'm not sure when their happy hour is but would love to return again in the future to grab some yummy sushi for cheap."}
{"text":"I've been thinking of starting a Lunch Special list, and no better way than to start it with a sushi lunch special review :)  Here goes, for $13.99 you get 4 items. 3 of 4 you get to choose & 1 being Miso soup.   You get to choose from and extensive well proportioned List of:  Udon Soup Ramen Egg noodle w/Vegetables, fish cakes Gyoza Soup Fried fish bowl Tempura Bowl Spicy Chicken Bowl Spicy Pork Bowl Beef Teriyaki Bowl Chicken Teriyaki Bowl* Spicy tuna Bowl* Spicy Salmon Bowl* Spicy Crab Bowl Unagi Bowl Curry Rice Bowl Mystery Bowl Tuna Sashimi*  Snapper Sashimi* Albacore Sashimi* Salmon Sashimi* California Roll Spicy Tuna Roll* Spicy Crab Roll Spicy Salmon Roll* Egg rolls Fried Scallops  Kroket Edamame* Spicy Tuna Salad Spicy Salmon Salad Cucumber Salad Salmon skin Salad Seaweed Salad*  I've Starred the items I've tried.... The rolls are very mediocre and don't even try the spicy tuna/salmon bowls. Its basically a roll with more rice. The sashimi is very fresh but It's such a small dish to waste a whole order on since you only get to choose 3 items. The chicken Teriyaki bowl was very tasty, but its hard to go wrong with chicken teriyaki.  Don't get me wrong its a GREAT DEAL, but you get what you pay for.  I still have hope for this place, so I'll continue to dine here for lunch when I crave sushi. Next time maybe I'll grab a noodle dish :)"}
{"text":"not as good as it once was...we are/were frequent fliers....todays service was bad...really bad. Food was fair...had a long hair in calamari, they took the hair and the calamari, but, did not offer refund or really anything except \"we have a problem with the staff\"..????????a VERY LONG WHITE HAIR in the calamari......after that I was so done...we dropped a 100.00 for fair....and I am saying that because the food was fair...the service was BAD!!!!!!!!! we eat here all the time...not sure what the deal is....i think that will be our last time.......sad to say.....the best days of this place ARE LONG GONE!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place! Tonight was packed but we sat at the bar. Justin, the sushi chef, was incredible. Very attentive, asked us about how it was, checked to make sure we were good and served us so fast considering how many people were there. The service as always was great which is another reason I always return. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants sushi!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food and prices. I will be back for more Blue Fin Tuna Sushi and rolls"}
{"text":"I thought the sushi was very fresh and prepared well.   We did order the shrimp tempura which was mushy and cold.   We mentioned it to our waiter and we received a new order that was perfect.  Service was a bit slow and it impacted the overall experience.   Also, some of the rolls were either over creamy or too spicy.  Maybe we ordered wrong.  But it's definitely worth trying again."}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls and great service. I would highly recommend to anyone one who loves delicious sushi."}
{"text":"With so many sushi places in this city - are there any that truly stand out from the rest?  Yummy Grill & Sushi, in my opinion stands out for its supremely fresh fish and \"off-menu\" items. The sashimi is phenomenal (Blue Fin Tuna & Toro respectively).  Rolls come in a variety of styles, tastes, flavors, with sauces, without. While my friend and I dined here we ordered the following: Come To Me (spicy), Dynamite, and Tomo Devil (very nice spicy taste). The Dynamite is like your typical sushi-places except it comes out in kind of a sushi format instead of a bowl.  Happy hour prices are quite nice. Ordered two rolls, one a spicy/crunchy tuna roll that I quite enjoyed.  Kanpachi with Serrano was somewhat disappointing. The sauce the sashimi is served in has an odd taste to it, and the Serrano pepper, while spicy, does not necessarily add to the fish in my opinion.  We ended our meal with fried green tea ice cream. Crunchy exterior, smooth finished ice cream with a strong green tea taste.   The restaurant itself is small, so if you go during high-peak times make sure to make a reservation. Also, it may be best to make sure you are \"pacing\" yourself here as each dish you order comes out at a much slower pace than most sushi places.  They do not do AYCE. No matter. This place is top-notch and should not be missed, based mostly on its super fresh ingredients, off-menu items, and its congenial staff."}
{"text":"Long time no see! Yet another chance (it's in the neighborhood after all...) BUT it's  still lack luster at best with the thinnest cuts of sashimi & and B grade fish unless you order of the over priced catch of the day menu... as if the sushi dudes were doing me a favor or whipped into minimalist submission by Chef Eric, who is now preoccupied by his big show next door . Big let let down never more! Sen of Japan on D.I. still blowing this place away."}
{"text":"I am from out of town so I thought this place had good sushi seeing that it had good reviews. I ordered 2 rolls (Cherry Blossom, Stuffed Tomatoes) for pick up. The lady on the phone told me they would take 25-30 minutes for the food to get ready. When I got there, they didn't event start making it yet. So they said 10-15 more minutes. There excuse was they were busy, but I saw quite a few empty tables and the bar only had one customer. The lady tried apologizing so much for their lateness on the order, but the rolls looked like they weren't even made right. I was hoping for at least some good decent sushi at this place, but it looks like they didn't even put any effort into making them. I attached photos of the rolls. I wasted $22 at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp tempura and the ichiban roll (it had crab and lobster) it was so delicious!!! Sucks that I do not live in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up. We got the Ichiban and Kamakazi rolls with a tuna hand roll, it was ready in 10 minutes really quick service and delicious rolls!! Will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"This place serves some pretty good Japanese food and sushi. Plus, the prices are pretty good and the service is great too.  I especially liked their miso soup with clam and salmon kama. They also have a large list of menu items for you to choose from. Only problem was they forgot my toro sushi and wondered if they still charged me for it. Oh well."}
{"text":"Rico sushi, gran variedad para elegir. El tamaño de los rolls es adecuado, todos muy bien presentados y condimentados. Recomendado por sobre el resto el \"that's what she say\". Los postres muy sabrosos también, en especial el cheesecake de te verde."}
{"text":"I hesitate to review this place because I don't want it getting so busy I can't get a spot. Hands down the best Sushi pound for pound in Las Vegas. I've eaten in just about every high end sushi spot in town. This place has the highest standards and probably the freshest fish in Las Vegas. And it won't break the bank. Simply amazing highly recommended!"}
{"text":"True to it's name, everything was so YUMMY!!!!! I ordered the following: Dancing Eel, Dynamite Roll, Volcano, Lobster w/ Cali.  Last but not least Hot night (tab spicy not overwhelming)  Cost $60 but I can't complain i had more than enough...I guess I was really hungry ready for a true lunch kind of day or my eyes were bigger than my appetite Great customer Service 2!  Really small cozy place not for a large group."}
{"text":"The quality of sushi is incredible!! Toro is mouth watering, an absolute must!! Yellow tail was so good. The Kobe sashimi was one of the most amazing things  I have ever eaten. You must sit at the sushi bar and take the recommendations of the sushi chefs. Really a great experience!!"}
{"text":"By far the worst sushi experience we've ever had. They make it out of sight, which is a bad sign, and it tasted like it was a day or two old. Not saying it was, just saying it was not very good.   The meat we ordered was sub par, not horrible but not good.   The salad literally tasted like they used cleaning agents as a dressing. Salad is always a favorite when going to a sushi place but this one was downright terrible.   On top of all that it was not cheap.   Would not recommend.   They had good soda.   Nice people, but the place sucked. I'm rating it honestly."}
{"text":"Most accurate business name ever.  I felt like I won the jackpot when I discovered this place. My buddy Jason and I came here around 9pm on a Thurday after the rush.   Chef William hooked us up (no pun intended) with the best Omakase experience I've had in this part of the world. A lot of thought was put into the course and it was like a work of art thst you can see and taste.   We had the soft shell crab followed by a string of nonstop goodness. toro, hamachi, scottish salmon, 450 pound tuna, and a couple other pieces and finished up with Hokkaido uni. wow....  I definitely eating here anytime i'm in Vegas. Thanks William and Yummy Grill & Sushi!"}
{"text":"I haven't Yelped in awhile but saw fit to tell of my experience here. I ordered edamame that came with a pinch of salt thrown on. Not sprinkled, or dashed. I ask for a side of sea salt and the waiter points me to the salt shaker on the bar. I willingly lick my Palm and sprinkled some salt on to test. It's table salt. I call him back and ask for a side of SEA SALT.... yes, I may have been a bit stern. I finally get that and call him back and ask for a glass of water. Halfway through my beans and no drink service offered. My roll shows up and the water follows right after. I'm ignored nearly the entire meal until somebody new appears from the back to ask if everything was ok. At this point I was nearly empty on water and finishing my beans with the sauces in front of me. I asked for more water. After a few passes by, and no water he reached for my plate as he was asking if I was finished. I informed him that I was not and was finishing my edamame. After this, no water served and the check arrives. The saddest part of this review is that I live within ten minutes walking distance and enjoy a stroll to and from meals as it aides in digestion. I won't be returning to this place and the only reason they've received (2) stars is because I couldn't quit dipping my edamame in the residual sauces from the roll."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. Got the lunch special ($12.95) where you can choose 3 items from a sub menu. I got the CA roll (6 pieces), tuna sashimi (2 pieces), and unagi bowl. It also came with Miso. The roll and bowl were both good, but not spectacular. The sashimi was beautiful! It has the deep crimson color, and the cut was both generous as well as aesthetically pleasing. I was still a little hungry afterwards, but that's because I'm a bit of a fatty."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a higher rating as the food is decent.  The service needs more attention to detail.  The guy working the register was very confused on what time it was and if the lunch specials were still available, we worked through it together.  I placed an order of cashew chicken TO GO and some egg rolls.  The cashew chicken came on a plate not in a to go container and the egg rolls, not sure what happened there as they never came.  Of course I started on the cashew chicken while I waited on a box to come.  The box came but the Egg rolls still never came.  I finally asked about the egg rolls and the girl said they were ready and asked if I wanted them now, of course I said yes please.  When she brought them over I noticed 2 in the order were cooked almost to being burnt.  The staff are all friendly and really nice, a little more attention needs to be paid to customers and what they are asking for.  As for food, over cooked is never a good thing.  Oh well, maybe next time I will have a better experience."}
{"text":"Update: I see there's a theme with the $10 minimum for credit cards. They are STILL not telling customers about this policy. Furthermore, it's 2018. Hardly anyone carries cash anymore. If they were loyal to their customers they would abolish the ridiculous, outdated $10 minimum!  Very bad customer service. There are no signs stating that there is a $10 minimum for credit card purchases. We are regular customers here.  I visited the store recently and placed a to-go order. The total came to 9.40.  I told her I would remember for future orders and reminded her we give them a lot of business.  Ultimately she would not let me pay for my order and leave because of 60 cents.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I came to Yummy Grill and Sushi last night based on recommendations from both friends, and the many high scored reviews here on  yelp, and I have to say I was not as blown away as i expected to be. I am by no means a sushi expert. I am fairly new to sushi, so my review is based my personal tastes.   I arrived with my wife just before 9pm. We were waiting on another couple to join us. We were hoping to sit at the sushi bar, as I find it more enjoyable, and enjoy talking to the sushi chefs as they work. The very small bar did not have four seats next to each other, so we sat at a table as we waited for our friends. A server took our drink order, and asked if we were ready to order. I told the server that we were waiting for two more people and we would wait for them to arrive before we ordered. While I appreciate the staff's desire to get our order, we were approached not less than 3 more times (all by different servers), and told them the same thing, that were waiting for friends.   While we were waiting for our friends, seats opened up at the bar, so we moved there. I counted at least 6 chefs behind the bar, and it took several minutes for any of them to greet us. Since we were up at the bar, my wife and I decided to start ordering, My initial order consisted of Ahi Tuna, Crab Roll Sushi and a Philadelphia Roll. My wife is not a fan of sushi, but she did enjoy the crab roll sushi since it was fully cooked. The Ahi Tuna was decent, but a much smaller portion than I receive at other sushi places,  The biggest problem I had was with the Philadelphia Roll. It was tiny compared to other Philadelphia Rolls I have had, there was a very tiny amount of rice on the roll, and it was obviously not rolled tightly as it fell apart on the plate, and the rice simply started flaking off the seaweed. VERY disappointed in this roll. My wife actually decided to order another crab roll sushi since she enjoyed the first order so much. To end my experience, I decided to order the Tiger Roll, a specialty roll. It was fairly decent, no real complaints about that.   One interesting situation that occurred was when toward the end of our meal, One of the (less experienced, I assume) chefs was telling a story to another, and he pointed right at my wife and I, while speaking in a different language. The other (more experienced) chef quickly noticed the strange look on our face, and immediately explained he was telling a story about his friends that were sitting in that spot, and did not mean to disrespect us by appearing to talk about us in a foreign language.   If some of my friends really wanted to go to Yummy Sushi, I would probably join them, this place would not be my immediate first choice of Sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"food and service is great! price is normal for sushi.   but 4 stars because they take a while to get your food out, but at least they bring you free little appetizers."}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery. The service was extremely bad. I really didn't care for how the food tasted. I have eaten worse but when you combine it with the terrible service it just makes me very disappointed. I do not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are advertised on the menu and the walls...No where does it say they are not available.....the restaurant is empty....yet I cannot order a lunch special at 1pm on a Friday. Because it's January 1st. Apparently on the first day of a new year you must order dinner portions or a la cart.  I don't want either, so I'm sitting here defiantly while my daughter eats the kid's meal...which I guess is holiday friendly and oddly comes with freezer burned French fries. We are the only ones in the dining area. This is uncomfortable for everyone. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today and it was as expected. I ordered the yummy bbq mix and my boyfriend had the short rib plate with fried rice. Food was excellent but docking one star for not being able to substitute bbq chicken for katsu on my mix plate. I usually go to LL bbq and they always accommodate. Next time I wanna try the Chinese and rolls"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love coming here for a late night snack! One of our favorites to get is the Garlic Edamame!  Yum! Will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I really love this place for quick reasonable priced chinese and sushi rolls.  Typically I wouldn't order rolls from a place like this but they are actually pretty good.  I feel like they are a tad expensive because they are priced almost like a fancy sit down full service sushi place, but this place is kind of like a few steps lower then that.  Anyways, I like it and go often.  For the chinese I only have tried a few things but enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"We were first timers last night, going to try a new place to celebrate 2 years of marriage, the happiest moments of our lives which included a lot of sushi thus far!  We wanted to sit at bar but only waited about 5 minutes for a family of 4 to skeedaddle.  We were seated in front of Chef Wen, and received great service from 3 different servers.  We received the free hot sake from the yelp check-in, I also had iced green tea and Eric R. had hot green tea.  We also were given complimentary Korean style pancake which was topped with some green onions!  We tried many items that are unique to here.  Unfortunately, the last live uni was ordered when we arrived so I could not try it yet.  However, we kicked off the meal with live scallop.  What is cool is that a chef in the kitchen comes out and shows the live shellfish before preparation.  We inspected our scallop before it was prepared into sashimi cuts, drizzled with yuzu juice (my eyes lit  up when I saw it!), black tobiko, and gold leaf!  It was delicate and delicious, with yuzu as the perfect complement.  Next we got hamachi belly nigiri, which was of course fatty deliciousness.  I ordered kohada which was yummy considering I am a big fan of saba.  The cure was similar.  We enjoyed sake with avocado and yuzu.  Eric R. got super white tuna, then I ordered live amaebi which came out to wiggle around on the counter and say hello.  On Chef Wen's recommendation we got blue fin maguro,which was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I tried an oyster and  then a salmon skin handroll.  Eric R. ordered an over the rainbow roll, which was like a California roll with assorted fish piled on top of the cut roll.  For our anniversary we were treated to free ice cream (plum and vanilla).  I completed the meal with the true dessert, uni nigiri.  Chef Wen topped it with a small piece of ika and some ikura.  I was really impressed.  Every day, the restaurant orders live uni and other hard-to-get treats, so every day there will be different special fish to try.  That alone makes it worth the trek here if you live far away.  I did not get to meet Chef Eric as he was off but we enjoyed Chef Wen and the other chefs.  Plus we sat next to a character who is also a regular, and we ran into Kevin P.  Considering we had no idea what the prices of any specials were as we ordered them, the price was less than we expected knowing it was an a la carte place.  Yummy is yummy!"}
{"text":"The quality of the fish at this restaurant is excellent.  Nigiri fans will have a lot to love about this place with their beautiful cuts of fish that almost fold under the rice.  They also have a lot of a great cooked menu items like the popcorn scallops and vegetable pancake.  The best orgasm salad I had was here - very large cuts of tuna and lots of tasty sesame seasoning.  We went during Happy Hour where you really only save about $1 per item and they offer a limited selection of half rolls.   A couple things that really bothered me about the restaurant is that the service dropped off in the middle of the meal and it seemed like they forgot about us.  It was also hard to communicate with the wait staff even though they were very courteous and made excellent suggestions.  The sushi rice was also too sweet, which maybe some people like but I just can't get into.  Still I would recommend trying to this place out to high quality sushi fans.  It is probably a better experience if you sit at the sushi bar with the chefs."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this small but pleasant restaurant probably one year ago, and until this day I love going here! I love their happy hour because they have my favorite rolls on. At the beginning of me coming to this restaurant they would take a very long time to bring out your food but as time has gone bye they are now very quick to serve what you order. I weigh approximately now 5 to 10 minutes tops to have a roll out or whatever I have ordered I appreciate the lovely servers and waitresses they are very pleasant. The sushi chefs are also very kind from time to time that I like to go alone as my little escape they are very friendly to you and they have amazing conversations I would highly recommend this place they are evolving day by day and becoming even more better than what they already are I love this place"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried their happy hour last night. We were genuinely welcomed at the door. Some of the best sushi ever. We ordered 5 different roles and veggie tempura. All were excellent. Our waitress was superb, her suggestions were right on. Its a small place in a nice strip mall so the atmosphere is just ok but thats not why you go here and you would not have this fantastic sushi happy hour at 3.50 a dish. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Have to admit that I wasn't too excited to try a sushi place in an old strip mall but boy was I wrong. Best sushi I've had in Vegas. And I've tried many of the popular ones on the west side. The Spicy Blue Fin Tuna roll is often on the special board and worth having every time. With the crispy onions on it, it is both unique and delicious."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. My wife had sushi and it was delicious. I had the teriyaki combo with chicken and bulgogi and it was also delicious. My combo came with salad, miso soup, cali roll and rice. It is very clean, and really quick food. The sushi was fresh and yummy. I will be back to eat again."}
{"text":"This place is a bit small but i like places like this But it was completely dead  I server kept staring at us I dont know if he was zoning out or what and really didn't smile at all He did welcome us and his service was good The food was also good and will probably be back the next time I'm on this side of town"}
{"text":"I always order here and just completed ordering 4 All-in sushi platters (56 pc). It was an urgent request and they made it possible on time. Their attitude and service is great. I have no idea of some of the customers leaving here with bad experience.   (Update) The team here at Yummy also gave me some service (free of charge) rangoons, egg rolls, and etc., for ordering all these platters for an event.   I have also ate here several times and loved the restaurant. I would definitely ask people to give it a try and judge for themselves."}
{"text":"So everything went great (except the service was super slow) until the check came. I showed her the 10% off from yelp and she marked it as used. Someone else brought me my card and receipt and had run it for the amount without the discount. The girl had brought the check, dropped it and walked off. I didn't even bother asking her to come back. We spent $60 and honestly it would have been better to go somewhere else since they limit you on the rolls you can have. The last time I was here it was a longer list for happy hour too. I also ordered a soda I never got. Disappointed."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I had higher expectations for this place and had a mediocre experience. We coincidentally dined here during their HH hours and decided to take advantage. We ordered a bunch of rolls and each came out in a timely manner. Since prices were cheap, we weren't expecting anything spectacular. Each roll was cut into 4 tiny pieces and they were poorly put together. My rolls were falling apart as I was picking them up. Also, it would be nice if they had a description of each roll. If I had known that our spicy rolls were drenched in mayo, then I would've requested no sauce.  Our saving grace was our a la carte sushi. The ahi tuna, salmon and uni sashimi/nigiri were excellent. The presentation was much better than our other dishes."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to have tried this place. My wife and I enjoyed the good food and the kids enjoyed the tasty large portioned shaved ice treats. I'll gladly be a return customer.)"}
{"text":"On my Yelp profile page it is about time that I replace \"My last meal on Earth: Whatever good restaurant is at the airport\" with \"My last meal on Earth: Yummy Sushi.\"  Yummy Sushi serves food that is just out of this earth. The chefs at Yummy are artists that create culinary music to the taste buds. The Yummy Sushi Chefs are conductors that start off your meal light and brings it to a crescendo.      If you read my reviews you will see that I am an adventurer on the hiking trails. Additionally I am an adventurer in dining. Throw a new cruisine at me and I am up for the challenge. Going back nearly three years ago in the Spring of 2013, after a hiking adventure in Red Rock Canyon, my friend encouraged me to try this sushi restaurant called Yummy Sushi. I never had sushi in my life. I accepted the challenge. It would rock my world. As soon as I tasted the Yummy (literally) fish, I have been a fan of sushi.     Friendship is the act of giving. I'd lead my friend on hiking adventures and she'd lead me on sushi adventures at Yummy. Sushi is a culinary art in itself. Between my friend and the talented chefs at Yummy including Eric and Dale, talented dining guides led me on adventures starting from the Spring of 2013 til the end of this 2015 til the future. My friend would check off the items on the white order form and I'd look forward to eating the fresh fish that the chefs had flown in. Throughout the last couple of years the five star food that I had the privilege to taste included sushi campache with the magical fruits from Japan, Avalone, King oyster mussels, dessert strawberry mochi, Seaweed salad, crab and cucumber salad with wasabi and ginger, taro cheek, kanpachi, ocean trout, miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sayori, sushi campache, King oyster mushroom with garlic, and my favorite spicy scallop. My ultimate Yummy Sushi adventure was when my friend treated me to the omakase for my Birthday. The omakase is when the meal consists of dishes that the Chef selects. My earlier Yummy adventures were complimented by sake. A little bit of alcohol can be beneficial to extreme food adventures. If I was drinking green tea during the omakase, I doubt that I'd have the strength to eat the fish skeleton with the eyeballs looking at me. This was my most daring food adventure ever.      Yummy Sushi is more fancy than classy. It sits in the Michael's and Chuck E Cheese-anchored shopping center at the southwest corner of Lake Mead Boulevard and Tenaya Way West of the US 95 interchange. The restaurant features counter and table seating. We'd always sit at the L-shaped counter seating. The chefs are part of the theatre that is the Yummy Sushi dining adventure. The L-shaped counter is the front row seating. We'd enjoy watching the chefs turn fresh fish into culinary art. We also enjoy interacting with the personable and talented chefs. Instead of discouraging pictures they encourage pictures of their culinary marvels. The chefs have always led us to outstanding food. The counter seating also has outstanding displays of the fresh fish.     My complaint about Yummy is that I never left spending less than $50. Recently I reviewed the Magic Tree. Unfortunately it doesn't have money growing off the leaves. If it did, I'd be practically living at Yummy Sushi. Nevertheless, Yummy Sushi does offer outstanding Happy Hour and lunch menus.     Yummy Sushi is one of a kind. At the time of writing this review, I want my last meal on Earth to be Yummy Sushi."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time. 13 was in our total group. Small, small place but they accommodated us and it just so happened we were there for happy hour! Service was quick,organized and on point! It was YUMMY!!! I found a new go to spot! No photos to show you guys because I was too busy eating!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch experience today.. Was actually looking for Kame but it took me to Yummy. I chose the salmon sashimi, spicy tuna salad and mystery bowl. The mystery bowl is one of the best Japanese dishes I've ever had- he did a blue fin tuna with sesame oil and crab mixed with sushi rice. So tasty! Great value- also served with miso soup and surprise appetizer for $14 after tax. Small, hole in the wall type place but great for a quick, filling and quality lunch option."}
{"text":"My family had really been craving sushi and we didn't feel like stuffing ourselves at an all you can eat place so we meet up with my sister's boyfriend at his favorite sushi place. We were running late so he ordered a bunch of happy hour sushi for us.   Happy hour sushi- yellow tail roll, spicy tuna, baked california were all good. Nothing extraordinary. The japanese lasagna was pretty good though.  911 roll- the jalepenos were super spicy but my dad enjoyed this.  volcano roll- our favorite. It was a whole bunch of stuff including mushrooms and scallops baked on top of a california rolls but it worked really well together.  tiger roll- sister's boyfriend's favorite. I don't really like shrimp tempura so I can't say much.  paradise roll- this was a last minute order since my sister's boyfriend and I were still hungry after our original order. I was really happy with this one. We were all a little hesitant about coconut on sushi but it ended up being delicious and i was picking up all the spare pieces of coconut off the plate when it was over.  Sashimi on rice- this was my mom's order. It took a good half an hour for it to come. She was a little disappointed in the portion size. There were only one of each kind of sashimi. There was furikake on the rice which was a nice since the fish to rice proportions were pretty bad. The sushi rice wasn't seasoned enough but the carrots had been pickled and were good. The tamago wasn't sweet enough.   The sashimi quality was great but the portions in general were pretty small. I'm usually stuffed after a $10 specialty roll but we each had a specialty roll plus a couple of happy hour rolls. I believe they get their fish flown in from California, which kinda explains it.  Our fault for eating sushi in the middle of a desert."}
{"text":"Yummy Sushi & Grill is by far the best in town  Despite only 3 check ins, I've been here 10 times...   And I come for happy hour and regular...   Looking to try, come for happy hour... they get 3 shipments a week of fresh live product a week...   If you're hardcore, check out Kame next door...   I haven't but will.. it's an exclusive sushi experience by reservation only twice a night...   Ok.. gotta go, the super white has arrived"}
{"text":"Vegas seems to have a glut of accessible sushi roll restaurants and they are all pretty decent. These are the type of rolls that satiate your sushi cravings.   There's no pretense here it's just good quality rolls that will leave you super filled.  The popcorn scallop ($9) was unique. The rolls are pieces are all decently priced around 2.50-5 and they have happy hour prices too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place:) Every order was prepared with quality fish. The only thing I found unusual was the Santa Barbara Uni I ordered. I've ordered Santa Barbara Uni from Beverly Hills in SoCal to San Francisco in NorCal and this was the very first time I've ever observed Santa Barbara Uni packed in a wooden box like Japan Uni stacked on top of each other in quantity. I've always observed it packed in a white foam cooler box and not stacked on top of each other in a wooden box like Japan Uni is usually packaged. The Uni I was served did not look like Santa Barbara Uni I've ordered countless times in the past at various high quality sushi restaurants. Other than this, I enjoyed everything I ordered and the service was very attentive. I'll definitely return"}
{"text":"Very affordable food and a large menu selection. My father really enjoyed this place. I recommend as well."}
{"text":"I thought the fish was very fresh and the chef did a very good job with the presentation. They have a lunch special for a cost effective option.   Overall a great experience and I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Yummi Sushi for awhile. Last time I went was like at  least 7-8 years ago when my friend took over the place back then. My husband wanted to have some good Japanese lunch but little more than just a ordinary sushi place. So I thought of this place because it seemed like they have new owner and got great reviews. We went there yeseterday for lunch. I was very satisfied with their menu and something that you cannot find at just neighbor sushi restaurant. I had live Octopus,Sashimi lunch special and some fresh sushi and sashimi they recommended. Oh, and their fresh Tacoyaki is really really great!!! Everything was so fresh and great! It might be little pricey if you get live fish but it is worth it! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients. While we ate, the head chef was showing his line cooks separate techniques for searing fish with a blowtorch. I found the experience of watching them work/train while also serving amazing sushi to be very worth the trip. Servers are very sweet & always had a nice smile. The chefs were very cool, they took a bow as we were leaving & I respect how much pride they have in their work."}
{"text":"Their staff is super nice and will take care of you if there was a mistake such as forgetting a spam musubi on the order for take out and making me drive back (they gave me extra and apologized NICELY). Thats a big deal since alot of rude ass people would say sorry with a nasty tone.  I love the food here too. Ive got nothing to complain about their food. Ive tried their spam saimin, teriyaki salmon, bbq mix combo, spam musubi, mahimahi musubi and i had no complaints such as too salty or the meat's too hard. Everything was delicious. I dont eat macaroni salad but if you do, you should try theirs out, because everyones been telling me that they have good mac salad.   Clean environment and the bathroom aint nasty at all.   I love this place! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because it got such great reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed. We loved this place. The fish was very fresh and they had a lot of very interesting and delish rolls. A must try is their super white tuna and toro. They were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"A place where u can get Japanese, Chinese, and Korean under one roof. 3 of us in out party today. We had Spider roll, Wo Won ton Soup, Kalbi BBQ chicken combo, and Meat Jun. Spider roll was good! The soup was good thinking it had msg in it. The Kaibi and meat jun had no complaints from the guys. Not a bad place to stop by. The have iced green tea that I saw a handful of people drinking. Overall average."}
{"text":"i\"m a sushi guy and this is my favorite place here in Las Vegas. Eric the master sushi chef will take care of all your need when ordering. Everything very good."}
{"text":"The proportion of fish to rice at this restaurant is great and it's a very authentic gem. We paid about $40/person but got a plethora of tasty, very fresh fish and indulged in soup, apps, tea, nigiri, and a bunch of rolls.   I highly recommend the Hot Night roll and the Unagi sushi. We also really liked the sashimi salad and the spicy tuna handroll. They gave us complimentary onion pancakes, edamame, and orange slices.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"A hidden diamond in the rough! Eric's sushi is down right amazing! Love this place! Has to be top three on my list!"}
{"text":"Yummy grill is our second home!  The are the best!  Since we eat here all the time, they know what we want.  The food is priced just right, and everything we've eaten here is delicious!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover. Place doesn't look like much but you'll love it. Never disappoints! Love the jackpot roll & yummy bbq chicken combo! So good. Also worth trying is the honey walnut shrimp & the teriyaki bowls, veggies are fresh & crunchy. Brown rice is a nice alternative option as well. Love this place. Think I'm gonna go there now. LOL."}
{"text":"The best little secret in town is now out of the bag and good for them! Been there several times always impressed how consistent the standard of food is. Just can't name a favorite food there is just too many and you will just thin I'm reading their menu.  Give them a try I know you will enjoy the too."}
{"text":"Was craving sushi and a friend suggested this place. I eat out a lot so I'm kinda picky. So glad he suggested this place. Had a wonderful experiences fish was fresh. Eric \"sushi chef\" was really friendly and made great recommendation. One of my favorite was the Live Tako. I don't know anywhere else in town that serves live tako. It was a very refreshing dish. The Hama Hama oyster is a also a must try. Very fresh and the fish eggs add great texture and unique flavor. We also had the bluefin tuna, it melted in your mouth like butter.  Price was very reasonable considering the quality of the food we got."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff!  Great food a little pricier than expected....  Toro was divine, screaming orgasm was saucy and the chefs were chatty and personable!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place you'll ever eat at. It's extremely good quality sushi and it tastes amazing. They have the best ice cream tempura and are extremely friendly people! I have to come here at least once a week me and my family can't miss out on the deliciousness !"}
{"text":"It's the best sushi place in town!! We had omagase and everything we had was so fresh and amazing! Eric was a nice guy and been patient explaining all kinds of fish to us; the other chef did excellent job on those fusion dishes. I normally prefer traditional way but his lobster dishes was just impressive. They did a very good job on selecting the freshness and the quality of the fish and other seafood. Toro and fatty yellow tail sushi was the best among all.  Will definitely recommend this place to all sushi lovers and can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night sushi craving after a long flight. The place is tucked in a shopping complex, which made it a bit harder for me to locate the place.   The restaurant is \"Asian-sized.\" :) I was seated right away bec there wasn't much people dining when I got there. I ordered otoro sashimi, regular uni (ran out of live uni), tuna, unagi and salmon nigiri.   My orders were all fresh. The proteins melted in my mouth. The rice was cooked al dente and had the perfect flavors of rice vinegar, salt and sugar!  The nigiri had a good protein to rice ratio.   The sushi chefs also tried to establish rapport. My bill came out to $56ish without the tip.   Come by this sushi place if you want legit sushi! :)"}
{"text":"I cannot believe all this time I've never visited this sushi joint..... It was an absolute treat fresh sushi/sashimi, don't miss to there specials!!!! I had bluefin tuna, yellow tail surf clam sashimi, and the most sweetest uni ever!!!! This is the only place I had so far that actually ask me of I want my uni from SD or Japan..... Oh and wait fresh wasabi!!!? Really really impress with this local treasure"}
{"text":"The best sushi spot in Vegas! They have the FRESHEST fish you can get despite being in the middle of a desert, haha. The staff is very friendly and attentive and watching the precision the chefs take when making rolls and dishes is amazing. Definitely my new favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"Great place love there sushi!!custumer service perfect,I going usually around 11-12 pm,they open till 2 am and they have a great dials!the food is  always fresh, thank you for great time:-)"}
{"text":"Had another wonderful dinner with great friendly service. Will be coming back to try out some of their other delicious baked sushi next time!"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time when my boyfriend lived down the street. We'd usually go for lunch, because the prices on the \"bento\" boxes as well as sushi was really great. We did go a few times during dinner hours, and while the food was still good, it was a lot more crowded/loud, and value isn't AS good as during lunch.   The seating area is really quite small, but it's not unpleasant. The staff is friendly, not creepy like some places. They were always willing to work with us on changes to menu items too.  We'd pay about $15 and be STUFFED! I don't remember what all we'd get all the time, but I do know they make great rolls with cucumber (that's our favorite). I also remember liking the tuna there (spicy tuna). Worth checking out if you're nearby, especially during lunch when price is good and it's not crowded."}
{"text":"Service was great, atmosphere was real chill, the sushi Chef Kei was a cool dude. Overall it was worth the drive to the other side of town! Definitely my new sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here to celebrate 7 years. Right from the start Chef Eric introduced himself and his crew of 3....impressive. Ordered the sweet shrimp, big clam, octopus, perch from the live menu....every bite was AMAZE-BALLS!!! Also ordered a few other items from the regular menu and they are great as well.  Throughout dinner Chef Eric continually talked to us and showed us his art. Our friends have raved about this place and now we know why!!!! Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"As far as a fast casual food restaurant this is a pretty good place. The sushi is always tasty, and the regular dishes are delicious and well priced, with a lot of food.   The staff is usually super friendly. Recently I was in there during the dinner rush and they gave my roll to another table, and then gave me their roll. The rolls were similar so my table ate it. The waiter got an attitude with us because we ate it, and kept glaring at my table for their mistake. Other than that isolated experience they are pretty good."}
{"text":"Seriously so super fresh! Their sashimi is melt in your mouth goodness! But with all this AYCE available out there I just feel like this place is pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Please note the name on this place \"& SUSHI\". This is not a sushi bar or sushi restaurant. When you walk in you must order at the counter, then pay, then sit and wait for your food. This is more of a fast food chinese restaurant than any sort of sushi place. The food looked pretty greasy and we decided to go elsewhere since were looking for Sushi in the first place. Mostly my issue is with the naming of this place than anything with the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"It has been over a year since I was introduced to this place by my friend Yer. Ever since then, this place has became my favorite sushi spot in Vegas.I brought many friends here and they all love it as much as I do.   They have high quality fish. I love their Kamashida toro, o toro, ama ebi, live uni, jikinmedi, king salmon, scallop, kapachi and everything that Eric prepares during omakase. I highly recommend everyone  try omakase in Yummy.   They are expanding their business and they will have omakase only in the unit next to their current place. I believe the current store will remain the same. I can't wait to see what Eric has in stores for us with their new expansion. Thanks Eric for the high quality sushi and affordable price."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. But not great either. I ordered the combo fried rice. It's hard to mess this up. But I didn't like it too much here. The chicken was dry and the food was sort of stale. The food was kind of a mess on the plate when it came out too.. not very presentable. I might not come back here again unless I was very hungry or adventurous."}
{"text":"Been coming to yummy grill for +5 years now. Probably one of my favorite sushi spots in town for rolls, I wouldn't recommend this place for nigiri  . Awesome service, the owners are always so welcoming!! They also have A5 Kobe beef!! I'd recommend this place to anyone that lives near this side of town! My favorite roll is the ex girlfriend"}
{"text":"I am not going to go into extensive sushi details because A - I'm a novice and B- I can't even use regular chopsticks.. Yes folks I need the kiddie ones but I have no shame .. Why? Because it's worth looking a fool especially from a place like this. I have been searching for a regular sushi spot since moving here and I finally found it!! To make it even better they are open late and have a happy hour after 10 with rolls that only cost like 3/4$ everything we got was delicious and the service was AMAZING!!!! My favorites of the night were the Mexican roll and the ice cream. Black sesame and plum were so freaking good!!!!!!! Save room to try them.,"}
{"text":"This place was good and found this on the internet.  Anyways I wished I had the sushi, but I was sick so I went with the noodles which was good. It was nice and hot and filled my belly. I loved the salad as well.  I wished I had the other dishes, but it is okay though.  I would come back here again."}
{"text":"New Sushi eater!!! I loved this place cheap and reasonable! ! Lunch special $12.95 for 3 items of yumminess!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place a second time, still 5 stars. Fresh fish, amazing atmosphere. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place rocks for sushi!!! Spicy albacore tataki was bomb as was everything else we tried."}
{"text":"Everyone at Yummy Sushi is always super nice.  I've been there 3 times since moving out to Vegas 2 months ago.  My fiance and I always get a HUGE hello when we walk in and the first time we were there we were bombarded with free food.    We went their for lunch the first time and were given scallion pancakes as an appetizer and some chef special roll that was tuna and crab covered in tempura flakes and deep fried with a spicy and sweet sauce.  It was amazing!  AND FREE.  The last time we went, we were there for dinner and the place was packed.  We sat at the bar and hung out with the sushi chefs who were cool guys and handed us coupons before we left."}
{"text":"Great food!! Open early and serve sushi early which is awesome!!! If I lived here I would definitely be coming here weekly. Food and sushi are on point. Great selection."}
{"text":"This is the first place I've ever had sushi, and still, it's my favorite in comparison to everywhere else I've been. I love their Spider-Man roll and crunch California's most. Also, GET THE CUCUMBER SALAD WITH CRAB. It's amaze-balls. I can't come and NOT get it. They're very friendly and don't give me weird looks like some places do, since I'm very much Caucasian. Lol. Come to Yummy! :) they're yummy."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday, first time trying sushi and had a good experience. The staff and head chef welcome each guest no matter if it is their first time or regulars. Defiantly will be coming back"}
{"text":"I'm glad that this place open so late & happy hour is late at night so it's perfect. Seem to be here two to three times a week after work."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Sushi was fresh, very fresh. Prices are the same as most other sushi spots, no surprises here. Chill atmosphere, authentic Japanese, not generic like some chain sushi places. Service was pretty good, no complaints. Food came out quick. I would come back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this little place stuck away in a shopping plaza....and we are  thankful we did!! We find ourselves doing more than just our date nights here but also happy Friday nights, glad to see you nights and occasionally the \"daayyyuuum, did you see what Miley Cyrus did?!?\" nights. Pretty much any excuse to come sit in their friendly atmosphere and experience another amazing sushi dish. My husband is a huge fan of the blue fin tuna and will eat pretty much anything fried and covered in eel sauce. We have been to many good sushi places in Las Vegas and still have many more to try, but, overall this is our favorite and I can't wait for the next time a celebrity does something jaw dropping so that I can get some Japanese Lasagna!"}
{"text":"Really really good variety in their fishes.  Wish the rice and fish were seasoned better, though.  Seems a tad bland but their king salmon was excellent as were the various toro cuts we got.  Nice atmosphere and you can't say enough about the friendliness of the sushi chefs and staff.  Really a fun place and I can understand why there are so many regulars."}
{"text":"Have been to this sushi place numerous times now, and they've consistently offered great food with great service. The place is small so come the weekend or dinner time there can be a wait, but it's never anything too outrageous.   The sushi is amazing and fresh!! They have a lot of creative rolls, my favorite is playboy :) the food can sometimes takes a bit too long to come out, as you'll already be finished with your rolls, and then you wait another 10 minutes or so before they bring more out, though you order at the same time. All in all not a big concern."}
{"text":"First time here but won't be the last time... Next time I'm in Vegas no matter where I stay I might be making a drive out here.  Fresh, delicious and they server the \"normal\" sushi plus some additional other than standard.     Reasonable prices, great lunch special and good service"}
{"text":"I have to add to the other reviews, the quality of the fish is pretty superb. I got the sashimi lunch special, and for 15$ I got   - miso  - house salad (which was actually pretty tasty)  - I think 8 super generous cuts of sashimi (2 tuna, 2 salmon, 2 yellowtail, and 2 halibut(?))  - 1 spicy tuna roll   the Sashimi was super fresh, buttery, and the pieces were thick! The spicy tuna roll was very fresh, the only complaint I had was that it was a tad salty.   Knocked off a star for slow service.  The waitress was a bit absentminded, my friend got a lunch special with chicken bowl, salad, miso and spicy tuna, and the waitress never got the spicy tuna order in and checked on us so infrequently that we had to wait an hr (after I had finished my meal practically) to ask her about it. Then it took another eternity for us to get it.   They seem to be a bit short staffed (hole in the wall place) so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"HH is awesome for those who enjoy fresh nigiri and a tastefully dressed salad like myself. Couldn't think of much else I'd want on the HH menu so I had them make me a specialty roll which included salmon, eel, shrimp tempura, cream cheese And avocado (all of my favorite things )   I'm coming back for HH for sure!"}
{"text":"Since I've moved up to Vegas, I've been coming here for a while.  I usually come here if there's an excuse to.  I don't necessarily hate this place, I just don't put this place on the top of my list.  It's just ok.  In past visits, I enjoyed the fried rice, katsu and other dishes similar to them.  The food is good, not great.  I think a lot of locals enjoy this place because it's always busy.  The prices are overall, good.  What keeps me coming back though is the spam hand roll for $0.99.  As stated in my profile name, I'm a huge Spam Eater.  Sometimes, I'm not in the mood for a whole musubi, just something small and the spam hand roll is perfect.  Small strips of spam, rolled into a small sushi, with a teriyaki soy sauce.  I enjoy it, but I can't really have a lot of it.  The soy sauce is super salty and gives me a headache after three hand rolls.  That still doesn't stop me from coming back for more.  For me, it's the only reason I still consider going there and haven't NOT gotten it at every visit (if that makes sense lol).  If you visit this place, I'm sure you will appreciate the variety of Asian cuisine offered here.  There's Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Hawaiian local food BRAH!  It's a small place located on a super busy intersection.  When you visit this place, be sure to grab a table right away.  It's first come, first serve and always busy.  Be prepared to wait just a little bit."}
{"text":"I've been watching everyone enjoy this place from afar for years and finally took the plunge to come back.   The BF and I came for the late night happy hour which is from 10pm to close. Various nigiri, rolls, appetizers and dishes are discounted. Some become a really good deal, some just have a tiny discount.   We got some rolls (comes 4pc to a order, not a whole roll).  Salmon skin - good, and the sauce is not too sweet and I like when places put bonito flakes.  Garlic yellowtail roll - pretty fresh yellowtail, simple but good.  Spicy scallop - was a crab and scallop mixture, just OK   Tobiko nigiri - duo of two kinds! nicely fresh.  Anago - very good anago and a generously large slice of it   Kaki udon - the broth was actually rather tasty, a bit sweet on the finish. This was rather filling and hit the spot.   We also splurged and got ourselves a live scallop (not part of HH). Fresh scallop is softer and sweeter than not live. I enjoy that other than the main scallop, they included the \"fins\" which are a bit more chewy and crunchy but I happen to really like it.   A few weeks later I went here to lunch with a regular, Christie O.   I had a chirashi bowl/sushi with rice. It comes with miso soup and salad, both standard, but good. The bowl had a decent amount of fish - 2 pieces of : yellowtail, tuna, white tuna, salmon, tamago and 1 piece of: octopus, shrimp, kani and surf clam. Also has some radish, and cucumber garnish. I took a few bites of Christies sashimi. Definitely all the fish was fresh.  I think the service is pretty nice here, though generally not speedy.   I guess this place has redeemed itself and I can see why people like this place. Will be back for some live uni."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my watch list for some time, ever since I was told that this place is better than Sushi Ota in San Diego. I am going to have to disagree and say that Sushi Ota is a lot better. However, don't get me wrong this place has very fresh sushi and is unique.   We dined in for lunch and they have some great lunch specials.  The Order: 3 item lunch special for 12.95: miso soup, chicken teriyaki bowl, and eel bowl.  Pretty good can't go wrong for the price.  Otoro: fatty pieces of tuna belly that tasted fresh but was hoping for the mouth watering, fatty, melting in your mouth experience.  Abalone: served sashimi style, really small, was hoping for more flavor.  Sweet shrimp: it was live shrimp freshly moving around. Loved it!!!  Very fresh. I liked the deep fried head, just wish they had a tastier ponzu.  Uni: good but I have had better.   Pros:  Their sushi is imported from Japan and is really fresh.  Most items are still alive.  Nice lunch menu.  They make their own wasabi from fresh wasabi root.   Cons: I think there are 2 restaurants. When we initially came in we were wondering if we were in the right place because the lunch side looks very dumpy.  Overall: I think this is great place with fresh sushi. Since I am not too familiar with a lot of restaurants in Vegas I can't really compare it to much. But wouldn't be surprised if this place has the best sushi in Vegas. I am giving this place 4 stars because I feel like the price point is set pretty high for specialty items. Also, the side we were dining on, was very dumpy. But then again, we came here for lunch so maybe things are different for dinner. I might come back here, but it would be for dinner."}
{"text":"We ate here a month ago on a Saturday night with my daughter and had an great time at the sushi bar eating and talking to the chefs. Tonight (after the hostess took phone calls while people were waiting) she told us children can't sit at the sushi bar on the weekends, so we left. Honestly, it seemed like a lie so she could send us to a table. It's upsetting because the food is good. But after being treated the way we were I'll never go back - with or without my daughter."}
{"text":"I just so happen to stumble upon this place, never knew it was here.  We were going to anther place, and found a piece of metal in our food, so we've been looking for another place.  So I did a little trial run.  I got a sweet and sour chicken bowl. (I wish I had gotten it with fried rice)  The cashier was cool, and they didn't offer me any other kind of rice.  So when I got it. I tore right into it.  The chicken was crispy and delish.  The rice was perfectly cooked.    Yes, I will be back.  Next time I will order it with fried rice."}
{"text":"For a quick bite to eat i qould recommend this place. They have good Teriyako combos which include miso soup chicken beef and calbi ribs, along with rice and salad cant beat that for 9$ love coming here when i don't feel like having anything fancy.. their sushi rolls are pretty good too recommend the spicy tuna rolls or the dragon rolls."}
{"text":"Good food.... If ordering to go, order in advance... Sometimes gotta wait loooong... But well worth it..... Meat jun is killahz(good)"}
{"text":"Should not be one star rating from California. Will never again, can't believe one piece of this Ikura Hand roll costs $18.. Yeah per piece. We've been going to many good places around neighborhood in La, Huntington Beach, Santa Monica..in Cali N' the quality is way better than this place, there are thousands sushi places in here our home. But since we were there in Nevada we just wanted to try this place as we saw on yelps, yeah 4 stars and 1/2 a lot of good review we decided to get a tried, I couldn't tell where the heaven was for this hand roll. This place just ripped us off. I better spend more on the good quality but not this $18 for one hand roll. Such as idiot to rip customer off. I wouldn't recommend any of my friends if they looking for sushi bar in Vegas. It is not an original owned by JP, i prefer going to Jp sushi is better than this place. Spent $150 for 2 people and ate couple pieces of Sashimi and these 2 fucking Hand rolls."}
{"text":"Been eating here at least once a month since August of last year. I havent tried anything that i didnt like. Me and my wife are particularly fond of the beef udon and all their lunch specials. Im also a big fan of their shrimp tempura and sashimi.  Staff is great. Everyone is mostly nice and service is good. I recommend this to anyone. Plus the vibe is good, we see a loy of people coming in as families or groups."}
{"text":"Great little japanese restaurant hidden in the suburbs of nowwhere.  My gf ordered the uni from japan and she says its the best freshest uni she had in vegas.  That says alot because she eats uni everywhere we go.  We also had the crazy horse roll and that was pretty good.  Im not a big fan of japanese cuisine so what i loved about this place was that they also offered korean bbq!   The kalbi was excellent..  my gf ordered the eel entree and that was great.  Everything tasted great.  I really liked that they offered more than the normal sukiyaki beef, or fried pork teryaki cutlets.  A++.  Oh just an added note, the waiter, a young man, was really nice, super friendly and gave us some complimentary salad.  Thought that deserved a mention."}
{"text":"I know this joint has a ton of reviews, but after dining here so many times over the last few years, they deserve another 5 stars.   This place is the best up North. THE BEST! We love us some good sushi and there are quite a few places to go to in town. If you're up in the NW corner, try this place out. It's great for lunch, dinner and late night.   We come here pretty regularly when we want sushi and it has yet to disappoint us.   They want their customers to know that they have fresh fish flown in 3 times a week and more if needed. They even bring out eel, fish and whatever to show the clients how fresh their meal is going to be. Honestly, I could do without. But it's still pretty cool for some people, I suppose.   We LOVE getting the Kobe roll here. That's very American, but good god...it's amazing.  Also, the yellowtail here is always amazing.   Everything we've had there, we've loved.   The service is always great and the sushi chefs are super friendly and always very helpful. If you give them an idea of what you like, they're always happy to make a creation for you.   LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Eric is great sushi chef. He always remember your name. Recommends great selections and what is fresh on the menu. Lots of live selection of fish such as UNI, shrimp, scallop. Even though the price is a little more than your average sushi place the quality is well worth it! You will not find fresh fish in Las Vegas like this."}
{"text":"I was deffinetely not impressed with this place....the atmosphere was usual for a small sushi bar and my girlfriend and I sat down at a table.  The server came by and gave us menus and seemed polite enough.  I would say the service was good but the server's lack of knowledge was very irritating.                                                                                                                                  First off when we asked the server about anything she had to run back and ask the sushi chef about a roll.  This happened 3 times !!!  I wasn't worried though because I heard they had good sushi...                                                                                                                                    So I ordered the kiss of fire (which is better at sushi loca) and dantes inferno.  The kiss of fire had a good texture and taste, it had the perfect amount of crunch and spice (this is where they get the 2 stars).  The dantes inferno was very blah though and the white fish tasted like it came out of the lake in desert shores.  My girlfriend ordered the chef's special roll, the server didnt know what it was (surprise surprise).  She didn't like it and ate hardly any, oh and it cost 14 dollars.                                                                                                                                     So by this time we were ready to get the hell outta there.  We didn't get a refill on our drinks the whole time and we wanted fountain drinks to go.  The server went to get our drinks but came back with only my girlfriend's iced tea.....sighhhh she claimed she only had one styrofoam cup.  Whatever this place sucks"}
{"text":"I always return here. I waste time looking around and trying to find better. No dice! Don't waste time. Go here.  Very friendoy, great fresh specials."}
{"text":"Yummy has a huge disconnect between its food and service. The positives: fish is super fresh and there's a lot of variety. I love the baby yellow tail. The fresh wasabi is a great change of pace and will definitely clear your sinuses. I have no complaints on the food side and would gladly come back for the quality of fish and seafood that was service. The tastes, temperature and textures were spot on and excellent.  Service: Went down hill from the word go. We were promptly seated and my fiancé knew that he wanted a large hot sake. I wasn't ready so our server left. She came back about 5 minutes later to take my drink order for a small hot plum sake. 5 minutes later my sake arrived. The server took our sashimi and roll order for the 21 piece chefs choice, a Johnny Roll, ex-girlfriend roll and a spicy tuna. About 20 minutes later our food arrives and the fiancé asks about his sake. About 2 minutes later his sake is delivered to the table behind us that remarks they didn't order sake. The server takes the sake and the cups and sets them on our table and asks the fiancé if it's hot enough. He replies no and she whisks it away.  Our server comes back, without the sake and asks if we want anymore rolls and we ask for 3 tuna, 2 baby yellow tail and 2 yellow tail (sashimi style). We ask about the sake again. About 10 minutes later the chef delivers our 2nd round of sushi, still no sake and he asks how our dinner is. We tell him that we're still waiting on a sake that was ordered over a half and hour ago and we haven't been able to flag anyone down since then. He apologizes and tells us the server is in training. He also notes all the rice on our plate and says you should have ordered it sashimi style. We did!   Finally about 5 minutes later our sake arrives. I am totally out of plum sake but don't feel like waiting 30 minutes for another one. We get our bill and the fiancé's large sake is discounted by 50%. After the terrible service and the cramped quarters I'm thinking we might give them a second try. This was a Friday at about 5 p.m. but we didn't think that would be their busy time by any means."}
{"text":"Great place to eat me and my wife went there and everything was delicious and the customer service was A1, we didn't have to raise a finger for anything!!!! You guys should definitely try this place out!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. It is consistently good. The rolls are good and the sashimi platter is perfect. The service is very nice and helpful which is always a plus. :) I reccomend the sashimi combinations. The fish is so fresh and so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Over and over and over again. The best! I've written other reviews here before and I feel compelled to do it again. Just the best, the absolute best!  For legit sushi lovers !"}
{"text":"Alright, so I FINALLY made it in here...and yes, it isn't that far from home.  I typically gorge out on AYCE when the sushi craving hits, so when I read some of the reviews and saw it wasn't ayce, I kind of didn't take it as a must-do...and put it on my bookmark backburner.  Now that I have tried it, I now know I was mistaken!  I know I am a little late to the goodness that is known as Yummy Grill & Sushi, but better late than never!  First up...the quality of food!  They have many LIVE options, which is obviously as fresh as can be.  Reading the other reviews, you will see many examples, such as live uni, live sweet shrimps, live fish options, and live mussels (which we ordered).  Of course, the mussel was super tender, with a great taste...probably the best I've had.  I know for sure the presentation was...shown to us still in shell, and served on a bed of ice inside its own half shell.  Check out my pic!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#SfbQPXXQPZlxdQU_nCFytA  But besides the live stuff, because I know not everyone will order live, the rest of the quality was still amazing!  Some of the best fish I have tasted sushi wise...with many literally melt in your mouth tender, buttery, and orgasmic.  Check out our sashimi platter, which had 21 pieces of delicious for $30 :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#aULMp0qkowNrgpvHGooBUw  It seriously was that good.  The cuts were nice and thick, very fresh and still cold when it hits your table.  I will go a step ahead and say it's probably the BEST sushi I've had!  I also ordered some nigiri too, and the fish/rice ratio was very good...see for yourself :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#u0FmODEewlgKJX0Ooo9ViA  They also do eel very well here.  The sauce and fixings are very welcoming.  We went with some nigiri and a bowl of unagi on rice, because it is my little boy's favorite!  The bowl came with about 8 pieces of unagi, and was a great value at about $12-13 :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yummy-grill-and-sushi-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#USN90UfR2H66vNaobRy1Tg  So you know how awesome the food was...that only leaves price and service!  Price, I can happily say, was not extraordinary.  I spent a little more than I would have AYCE status, but I definitely left happy.  All that food above and a few more nigiri ran me about $80.  That extra $20 was well worth the cost considering the freshness and taste, and the experience eating live seafood!  Eating smarter next time around, I think I would be closer to the AYCE costs.  BUT BUT BUT...I almost took off a star for service.  Service was friendly, but SLOW.  It took me almost 2hrs to eat the food above, and I have no idea why.  The food just took a long time being prepared, but it wasn't sitting on the shelf or anything, because everything was nice and cold.  The chefs must have been behind, but seriously it started getting annoying.  The server also realized it was going slow, so kept apologizing for the wait, and brought out some comp edamame, but don't come here if you are in a hurry.  The food was that good, as to not drop the review or experience though.  I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Our trip to Yummy Grill & Sushi was so enjoyable that I had to join Yelp! just to tell you.  The service was fast and wonderful, and the sushi was as fresh as I've ever experienced in Las Vegas.  Yummy's giant surf clam was so fresh that upon the first bite my mouth was flooded with flavor.  It's also a plus that they offer Orion beer here.  Yummy Grill & Sushi is my new favorite sushi place in Vegas."}
{"text":"The rolls here are really good. I've been to this place 5 times now and feel like they deserve a good rating. Quality and service has been really good. My rolls today were amazing... Check out my pics! The server gave me extra ginger which I love. So, overall a really good place. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I've had the Lunch special the first 2 times here before I learned my lesson. Don't go for the deal. Order the rolls. You will not be disappointed. The inside isn't glamorous but it's clean. Good music softly playing."}
{"text":"Love the owner, hard working man. Great variety of food but here's another Chinese restaurant that pre cooks all of their chicken so 30% of the time you order it is overcooked. The staff is great and they are very clean."}
{"text":"Good food. But why the hell are they always counting their cash on the counter? Literally every time I go there there's someone doing a money count. And why do they have so many workers working at once for such a small place?"}
{"text":"Im going to start and say that the food is really good here but i dont think the hype is real. Everyone is putting this place on the map as one of the go-to spots to grub on some sushi. I will say being that it is not AYCE you definitely can taste the difference but there are things here that i will say that Ive had at other places for way cheaper. I even came in during HH and still the price that we paid for everything was still kind of silly. Couple things that i could remember is their Taste like your EX GF roll,Hamachi Kama,deep fried scallop was really good too! I may not have came in at the right time because it was 10pm @night on a saturday and according to other reviews its all about the fresh menu. Here what we had...  Kushii & Kumamoto Oysters (Favorite) Otoro (not worth it) and Super White Tuna Nigiri  Fried Scallops Hamachi Kama Salmon Skin roll Spicy Scallop roll Fresh japanese uni nigiri (Wife enjoyed this alot) Crunch Roll Taste like your ex GF roll ( Best roll)  I dont think for me it was worth the drive but i definitely enjoyed the food. Not sure if it was good enough to say \"this is my new spot\" but everything was great as far as service. The only thing i wish for during my experience was that the waiter who waited on us gave us some more recommendations because i didnt have a limit on how much i wanted to spend i just wanted what was the best there and maybe shouldve coordinated with ( NELSON Q) to sit on the bar and make sure i got his tips before walking in."}
{"text":"Came here after work for happy hour. After waiting at the door for a while we got seated. Once we were seated it was almost 10 minutes before our waiter came to our table. When we asked for the happy hour menu he told us happy hour ended at 5:45. I looked at the time it was 5:46. I asked him why the website said happy hour ended at 6. His response..we end happy hour 15 minutes early. Since we we had our minds set on sushi we decided to stay...BIG MISTAKE! It was another 10 minutes before they came back to take our order. There was a couple that sat down at the table behind us as we were placing our drink had already received there food..before we were even able place our order! we had to ask multiple times for silverware, napkins and refils on our drinks. I guess if you ask for the happy hour menu they decide to make your visit a horrible one. Will not going back to this place again!   PS.. The sushi wasn't even that great. It looked like it was just thrown on the plate. Horrible presentation."}
{"text":"It's been ages since we've visited Yummy, but with the growing buzz surrounding their daily fresh fish and specialty offerings (like the occasional live uni), we decided we needed to revisit! Granted, I don't eat live uni, but if a spot is dedicated to delivering high-quality, fresh fish, I tend to believe they are going to deliver an all around delicious experience.   Two delicious items I experienced: 1. Yellowtail with jalapeno: Super fresh and the cuts were definitely bigger than your average serving of this classic.   2. Chicken Teriyaki Dinner: Yes, I ordered chicken teriyaki, and it was dynamite. It came with soup and salad, and the servings were generous. The salad was fresh and served with a notably yummy yuzu dressing. It appeared to be two chicken breasts, and the flavor was everything you dream of in a teriyaki.   The offer  brown rice, even for their sushi rolls, but it does come with an upcharge of $1/per roll or $3/entree. This can add up pretty darn quickly!  Overall, though: a definite must-try for fresh fish lovers, and if you're not a fish lover, there are plenty of items executed well for you to try."}
{"text":"Bento boxes are to die for.  Best shrimp tempura I have had in a long time.   Small place but the food was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I will totally give this place a 5 star, by far the best Chinese, Japanese, Hawaiian in town. The portions are usually pretty big. I have never been disappointed here... If you are reading this, go try this place!! Staff is always helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Actually this place is pretty good.  Not only the food is delicious and simple ..price is also decent. Not to mention you can tell that the  place is a must go if you are around the area because there is a pretty steady flow of customers coming in and out if this joint. I got me a salmon skin salad . At first I was like mmm what is it? But after I got it yummmmm the salmon skin is crispy and sooo good !.....crunch crunch with your greens. The place is not something you have to go out of your way but if you're around the area, go for it :)"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi .... never been disappointed... I think they have the best crazy jalapeños .... great service ... great food"}
{"text":"Good, fresh food. Great service. Tiger roll was delish and the rice was great too."}
{"text":"Leaving your customer on the phone for more than 15mins without any explanation. Lame."}
{"text":"Very Yummy Food. We like the chef special seafood. The oyster so fresh & grill shrimp head delicious. Good place to hang out have dinner & drink japanese beer with friends. Plenty room to book for event party here. Sashimi always fresh here."}

{"text":"Very good sushi, I would rate the quality at 4 stars , but the time it took to get rolls was very long, we started with a order of some Masago and Ikura along with 3 other rolls, it took about 15 minutes to get the Masago and Ikura then we waited another 20+ minutes to get the other rolls. So the rating is because of the slow service and excessive wait, so we ordered two other rolls early , and still waited a long period for them .  Not sure if I would return because of the wait , but the sushi was very good."}
{"text":"This little gem is right around the corner from me!    Prices are reasonable, food was delicious, and it was super cool sitting at the sushi bar watching the cooks (?) make the different foods.    Probably one of the best sushi places I've been to."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I came last night with three friends and got a beef bento box and a caterpillar roll. The bento box was good, but the caterpillar roll was great! I taste-tested my friends' orders, and all of the sushi was super fresh and tasty.   The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the service. About three different waiters were waiting on us and none of them were that friendly/helpful. I couldn't even tell if one of them was being rude or if he was trying to funny.   In all, though, this is a great restaurant for fresh and yummy sushi."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sushi restaurant... But what a gem!    I don't claim to be a sushi gourmet but at the same time I eat lots of sushi.  I have had sushi weekly for the last 20 or more years.  Yummy Sushi has a varied menu with unusual fish on the menu.  I love it."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi places are located in shopping centers...Wonderful experience here. The dining room is smallish but with a nice, relaxing atmosphere. Fish is fresh fresh fresh, melt-in-your-mouth bites of delight. The service was timely and the prices were reasonable. I am a sashimi girl, but I would highly recommend the Rock and Roll...roll. There is no rice used, it is filled with fish and a little bit of Japanese radish, wrapped in cucumber. Comes with a lovely sauce that I unfortunately don't know the name of, but it tastes creamy and has the appearance of a light bearnaise sauce. Maybe someone can help me out there. I also had 'fresh' wasabi for the first time and I am hooked! I didn't even know there was such a thing and I've been to more than a few sushi places. Come here, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummy is a perfect name! Highly recommend the Blue fin tuna sashimi and their rolls are large, fish lover fantasies. Great, personable employees. Definately will return."}
{"text":"Love coming here late at night. I get off of school after 10, and this is one of the few places that's open past 10 at night. If you like garlic edamame, they make it the best that I've ever had. Everything I've had here is great. The service is quick, and the waitresses are super sweet. Love it!"}
{"text":"I've been here more times then I've actually checked in. Always had good to great food and service to match. I have always come with my wife and daughter (9yrs old). We have always sat at the sushi bar, because like most children, my daughter likes to watch the chef make our food. Tonight we arrived and after being greeted we were told that \"kids can't sit at the sushi bar because we serve alcohol\". 1) she sits at every sushi bar 2) we've sat at this one every time we've come here 3) so because you serve alcohol to the tables, does that mean she can't sit there either? This city us filled with sushi restaurants, a lot if them are pretty good. So really you go because of the service. And this was not good service. So I will not be dinning here again."}
{"text":"Chef Eric continues to wow us with a culinary journey.  My husband Kenny hates salmon, but ate all of the salmon prepared! Last night we had the expertly prepared live hairy crab. Pricey,  but we don't mind paying for the experience of fine cuisine. We found this gem over a year ago and we haven't looked for another Japanese restaurant since."}
{"text":"It never fails that every time I try to write a review for Yummy, it's when Yelp is down for maintenance!  I've been coming here for years (my pre-Yelp years) since I work around the corner. I come here every week almost and this week I was here twice...mostly to-go orders and the occasional  meeting up with Yelpers.   I come here too often that I should be getting desensitized by their food by now...but no!  I keep getting the same stuff which is a problem of mine: edamame, salmon sashimi, spicy salmon bowl, any rolls with salmon or tuna.  The quality of fish here is good. I've tried their scallops, blue fin and uni before - those were amazing.   It's a good thing I didn't go here alone today and I got to try other items on their lunch menu like their pork belly (one of the best I've had. The fat was rendered well so you don't get that gross glob of fat in your mouth feel), garlic edamame (I stepped away from the regular edamame this time. They were very garlicky and a bit spicy and oh so delicious!) and the Unagi bowl (fresh-tasting eel and the sauce wasn't heavy). Then there were items we got today that didn't wow me: ramen, spicy tuna bowl, spicy pork bowl and the salmon skin salad. I've had better elsewhere. For some reason they went crazy with bonito flakes today. They were either cleaning their pantry or trying to conceal something in our food bowls. But there was definitely a bonito flake party!  Service is better during lunch. I never have to wait long for my food the times I've been here maybe because they're more considerate of the working lunch crowd? I should come here for happy hour one of these days. Want to come with?"}
{"text":"My sister asked me to have dinner with her after spending all day in the ER with my grandmother. Starving and puzzled where to gorge myself and eat my feelings. Remembering my sister lived by this great sushi place with a reverse Happy Hour, we decided to meet at Yummy Grill & Sushi.  Immediately entering, I was greeted with \"Moshi, moshi\" by all of the staff and sat down with my sister.  Immediately a server came over, greeted us, took our drink orders, and handed us menus. We ordered the garlic edamame; the MOST delicious stuff, ever. I ordered a second round. I wanted to lick the extra sauce left over in it. I also had a bowl of their Miso Soup, excellent as well.   Let's get to the sushi. Since it was happy hour (4 PM - 6 PM Sunday through Thursday/ 10 PM - 1 AM everyday),  rolls are priced as low as $2. All happy hour sushi contains 4 pieces and they aren't extra small pieces either. Our drinks arrived with a free portion of their veggie pancake. It had a nice, delicate flavor. We ordered the spicy tuna roll and avocado on top twice (if you've never tried this, do, it's heaven) and they didn't charge me extra (how RARE is that). The shrimp tempura crunch roll was divine, we ordered that twice as well. My sister got an eel roll, which she loved (I love eel sauce, just can't handle the texture. I tried it, it tasted amazing, but let her finish it). We order a Philly roll, which was yummy, you can't go wrong with creme cheese, salmon, and avocado. I especially like that it was fresh salmon. Some sushi places use salmon that has that smokey taste to it and it just ruins it for me. The garlic albacore came with the garlic sauce on the side; the sauce was so good I wanted to spoon the rest of little bowl of it like soup. The Japanese Lasagna was also AMAZING! Warm and perfect. My sister and I had about 7/8 rolls, 2 orders of that garlic edamane, and miso soup, total damage: $41 and change and we were stuffed to the gills! Our server was very attentive and answered all of my silly questions (and trust me, I have a lot of them).   This particular night they had a lot of fresh seafood options, the board read: O'Toro, Blu fin Tuna from Spain, Nodokuro, Sayori, Live Uni, Scallos, Octopus Legs, Abalone, and Lobster. They have a variety of non-sushi dishes from a variety of Asian cultures. The place is small, but has a family like feel.  This may be the best sushi I've ever had in Vegas and that's a huge statement because I am super, duper picky. Well done, Yummy Grill. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ignore the silly name, this is a high quality sushi restaurant. The Chefs, will prepare some delicious sushi and sashimi. The service was better than expected. I am surprised this place isn't on the strip, it could very easily sit in the Wynn or the Belagio."}
{"text":"Average is what comes to mind about this place. Decent selection and clean enviroment. Nothing special about the atmosphere. Usually pretty empty inside. I do like the fast and courteous service. It's a good spot for quick lunch while at work.  i've never really tried their \"chinese-style\" entrees, but they looked too greasy for me to be appetizing. Sushi was average, not too fresh, but not terrible. Deserts (frozen peach sorbet) was yummy, albeit a bit frozen.  Overall, just an average sushi place. Okay for lunch if you work near-by, but otherwise, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ive been to multiple sushi restraunt around vegas, this is the worst one. Expensive, terrible service and the food wasnt good at all. Wouldnt recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"This is the one meal I was looking forward while in town. Thankfully a waitress was very sweet and friendly. I felt like I'm meeting with a friend hahaha she so sweet able to get us in that evening while super crowded. This is the one hot dining spot in local Vegas.   One the food for the menu is simple. I browsed and read reviews before we came. So we knew what we wanted to get. Overall this is great dining experience. This is the great asian option while I'm in town Vegas. Thank you. I will come back soon."}
{"text":"Yummy Grill is a quick grab bag of Asian cuisine. There are elements of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Hawaiian influence in their menu. This is one of those places where it is easy to stop in while running some errands.  The food comes out quick and the prices are reasonable. For three people, we had lunch for $35. That included three entrees, one roll, and two hand rolls. The food is solid and there was nothing to complain about. I had ordered the Mongolian Tofu and a Spicy Tuna Hand Roll. My main meal came with a large scoop of rice and two cream cheese rangoons. As a lunch special, it came out to be a little under $7. The amount of food was generous and filled me up. Kept me filled until dinner and that is rare with Asian food.   They are set up like a fast food joint more than a sit down. The prices are a little high for that, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Not from Vegas, first time here. The 2 stars is for food. The service is ZERO. My boyfriend and I went together for lunch, ordered appetizer and miso soup and each a entree. They brought the appetizer and my entree at the same time.  Ate the appetizer and waited for my boyfriends to come.  While we waited and waited and waited our waitress was nowhere to be found I'm assuming she went on lunch or break. The other server was on the phone and not around.   Almost 20 minutes later the other server passes by and I asked her if there was a time frame on my boyfriends food. And turns out our food was sitting there just waiting to be served this whole time.  Shame didn't seem like there was any communication at all and neglect to their customers. I went to have lunch with my boyfriend not for me to eat my meal alone. Then have him eat alone."}
{"text":"This is the second Yummy location I've have been to, the first being on Sunset @ Marks. This is a lot smaller, more take-out oriented location. Be prepared for a wait, even for simple rolls. Sushi is not bad but a little overpriced. Cooked combos are all excellent and they have many different styles (Hawaiian, Korean, Chinese, all delicious). Odd location in the shopping center and in a competitive area for sushi restaurants. Outdoor seating only if you \"take-out\"."}
{"text":"Ever since our favorite sushi place closed down, my boyfriend and I have been searching for a new sushi joint to call our own. Yummy Grill & Sushi is definitely it! We have been here several times, and have never left disappointed. I am always impressed when a Vegas restaurant can get such fresh seafood. The entire staff is extremely welcoming and pleasant every time, and the sushi chefs are top notch. Also, make sure to like them on Facebook. They are always posting pictures of their fresh fish arrivals, and any specials they have running that day. The pride they take in their food makes them a winner in my book! :)"}
{"text":"I wasnt expecting much from this place, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is located in a strip mall next to a Target. Not exactly what you think of when you think great food. The interior is really informal and there were a lot of people coming in for carry-out during lunch.  The people who work there were all very pleasant and the service was good. I was in the mood for sushi so I ended up with spicy yellowtail sashimi, a spicy tuna handroll and a california roll. All were at least average, good stuff. Honestly, of course a place like this isnt going to compete with some of the top sushi places in town, but it definitely holds its own in the midmarket sushi category. I would say the freshness here is spot on, really good, the only downfall might be the fish quality. It isnt top of the line, but definitely above average."}
{"text":"While I was in New York, my cousin from Canada wanted to meet up with me before she head back. Well, of course she requested to have dinner here. As always food was amazing, we did order our usual there and Luis made us his special roll...don't asked me what it's called...just know it's good especially the fried onions. To top that off, one of the chef handed us this salmon plate that I saw him used a torch was delish! Happy New Year to chef Eric and his crew."}
{"text":"It was just ok. The tempura was really oily. The rainbow roll was very delicious but not enough to bring me back. Service a little spotty. A little pricey. For what we paid we usually get twice as much at our regular place on spring mountain and Charleston."}
{"text":"I love sushi. I love spicy tuna and fresh ahi.  We're out late and decided to try this place, it stays open late.    When we arrive, we're greeted right away by the staff and are shown our seats, we are delighted to find a combination of bento boxes and we choose two right away.  We also make sushi selections, trio of tuna, anago (another big favorite) and spicy tuna.  The bento boxes come with your choice of meat, salad, miso soup, california roll, and some tempura vegetables.  Very good, reminded me of my mother in law's miso soup, very buttery and warming.  The sushi assortment was spectacular, we ordered too much, but we ate every bite and love it!  Good service, fresh sushi and fun place to enjoy a good meal!"}
{"text":"This is good, freshly made food! Good value in price too! Recommend the meat jun, California roll and spam hand roll. Food may take a bit long to come but that's ok to me because I like my food prepared fresh! Hawaiian Sun juice...$1.35.  So far we've eaten here twice and both times we were very satisfied and left full!"}
{"text":"Today I called Yummy Grill and Sushi was trying to plan a day with my wife and needed a few rolls to take to her office.  Spoke with Eric the owner and made it happen , put it on a nice plate decorated it and all . Great place Sushi was great ! Thank you Eric and staff for  a great experience !"}
{"text":"If you're leaning toward eating some Asian cuisine but not sure specifically what you want, Yummy Grill & Sushi might have what you're looking for. Although a good portion of the menu is sushi, they have a broad menu covering other cuisines which is good for my family because not everyone is a fan of sushi like me.  Four of us came on a Saturday night and decided to sit in the restaurant right by the open kitchen. But you can also order from the counter to go, pick up, or delivery. There were about three servers on the floor covering the 7 to 8 tables and the service was prompt and friendly. Wait time was minimal, orders were correct, questions were answered, and drinks were kept topped off.  The first two pages of the menu are sushi and the second half of the menu is split into Grill and Chinese sections. The Grill sections favors Japanese items but also has a little Hawaiian influence. From the sushi section, I'll usually get the chirashi bowl has a nice variety of fish for the price. The nigiri and rolls are pretty average. Other family members order from their hand rolls which are the perfect portion and dirt cheap. My daughter has been on a spam musubi kick and she was happy that they offered it.  I enjoyed the BBQ short ribs and was very pleased with the portion size and the seasoning on the ribs. They were grilled just right and served with a scoop of white rice and macaroni salad. Also ordered were the teriyaki beef and teriyaki chicken which come with the miso soup and a salad. My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which of course I had one wrap and the chicken was well seasoned in fresh, crispy lettuce. Portions were large and about 3 boxes of food had to be taken home giving us good value for the $52 price tag for our four person meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I are all about customer service so when we go out to eat sushi we know Yummy sushi is the place to be! They greet you when you walk in like you're somebody important, they're always smiling, there is ALWAYS sports on the TV and the food is simply amazing! I had a PLAYBOY ROLL that was to die for, you ever eat something and its so good it makes your mouth water? Yeah that's the Playboy roll. :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi away from the craziness of the strip. Worked in the city for 8 months and this was my go to spot for sushi.   Fresh fish, great staff, and well priced. Large parking lot a big plus."}
{"text":"Dear Yummy Grill, please sell your spicy garlic ponzu sauce...it's amazing and the other sushi places in Vegas can't compare to it.   P.S.  Your Last Samurai Roll is to die for"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch today because my car had maintenance at a shop. I walked in and asked about their lunch specials. I was given the menu and had 3 choices for lunch not a bad deal. I was sat and placed my order though I must have waited an honest 20-25 minutes before I saw my food or appetizer which was on the house. There were 2 couples at the lunch bar and 1 guy by himself so it was not packed, but not busy. I know sushi takes time to prep but again in my eyes 25 mines, a full episode of sports center played through before I ate anything. The rolls are either small or something I am not used to. I had only 6 pieces per roll for the spicy salmon, and spicy shrimp rolls along with a bowl of spicy chicken for my 3 lunch items. The food was decent though the sushi had onions in their rolls, the same rolls i would order at my other sushi place and they serve it with no onions. I was surprised but whatever. Would I come back? No I am loyal to where I go. Only 6 pieces per roll is not much and it's not an all you can eat so if I did come back it would be almost $10-15 per item. The place I go to is AYCE for $25 lunch and $35 dinner."}
{"text":"The sushi here is SO good. My favorites include the Japanese lasagna and the vegetable fried rice.  The miso soup is also yummy.  Happy hour here is pretty good too, and if you do check in through yelp, you get a free bottle of sake (i have not cashed that in yet).  They used to have real scallops for their happy hour fried scallop dish, but last night when i was there, it was imitation scallops.....almost tasted like imitation crab meat, only rolled into a scallop shape.  Perhaps an oversight, perhaps a permanent change? Who knows....  The service is friendly, and really accommodating, and i will be back numerous times in the future"}
{"text":"This place is seriously good.  Walking in, the staff is always quick to greet and seat you, and I think we've been fortunate enough to always come at a good time.  It never seems to be overcrowded.  I eat a lot of sushi, and it's easy to get familiar with the taste, or find something that really stands out.  The rolls here are flavorful, and fresh tasting, and it makes ordering additional rolls a little too easy.  The nice thing about these rolls is that they fill you up without making you feel stuffed or like you've gorged and are going to regret it later.  Some sushi doesn't always fly with me.  This has remained consistently pleasant.  Also of note is their sake.  The have a sampler that offers fiji apple, plum, and raspberry.  Honestly, I can't recommend one over another.  They're all good, and like the sushi, they don't overwhelm.  You will likely feel comfortable after a few, and really that's the way I prefer it.  We had a dinner party tonight, and bought a full bottle of the plum assortment.  Whee-ha.  No complaints.  As mentioned earlier, the staff is nice.  There are certain sushi places that always want you to try samples from the chef.  We've tried these salty little pancake type appetizers that were a nice filler, and tonight, they wanted us to try this smoked fish head platter.  I appreciate the thoughtfulness.  What I did try was actually quite good, as it came with this vinegaresque sauce, but push comes to shove, I don't think it's going to be a regular thing.  Still, it was a brave, new experience, and I like to be nudged out of the comfort zone once in a while.  I blame the sake.  A few times in, I'm consistently pleased.  It's consistently good, which means a lot, has a great overall flavor, and the staff are attentive and friendly.  I fluctuate from sushi place to sushi place.  Some stay, others I end up making a one time meal, but this place is quite alright, and I can easily recommend this little place to friends."}
{"text":"I only go here if I'm going to Canyon Falls to buy a new weave or on my way to the cigar store...I've never had good sushi here ...EVER... But the staff is nice.... But not nice enough to go back and fear I may got sick from old sushi ...,"}
{"text":"So...Had a sudden craving for sushi for lunch...the only problem? I was at work and couldn't leave. So after doing much research on yelp I came across a few places that deliver and this was one of the first ones on the list...I'm less than 5 miles away from this place and I was just flat out refused service for delivery. I even offered to pay an extra delivery charge in addition to what they had. I also clearly stated that I had a big order but instead got a chuckle and a flat out no. I ended up calling Island sushi instead which is about the same radius as this joint and was greeted with friendly and helpful service. Oh and PS I'm located in Henderson just up Eastern from this place...save your time if you're in my area and call Island Sushi instead."}
{"text":"So good!! Get the Japanese uni! Fresh rolls, prompt service, delish complementary scallion pancakes! This is our new go to sushi spot!!"}
{"text":"My initial response was umm....no we are not eating there.  But of course I was pleasantly surprised by this place...don't get it confused with the Yummy Sushi in Henderson (horrendous)...because the sushi is worlds apart.  The sashimi was very fresh, the only item that tasted fishy was the clam, but I think that's probably an acquired taste.  The rolls were made well and presented nicely.  They also have a happy hour time too, for those looking for a late night eat.  Also no AYCE for those looking to consume a massive quantity of sushi."}
{"text":"We came here from California. . And let me tell you I eat a lot of sushi in California. We came here because of a reference and it's so yummy. We had the 007 Arizona lobster and joy roll. All were flavored with yummy sauces and did not disappoint. I think my favorite was the lobster. We also ordered edamame and a salmon box . . Gyoza.. A couple of sodas. . Came out to 83 and we used the check In for 10 dollars off. We're full and satisfied I think this place is good. We also got refills like crazy. Service was good and fast and the servers were nice. Gonna come back. :)"}
{"text":"I eat sushi every week and have been to Yummy maybe three times now. I have to say that although Yummy isn't bad, their fish just didn't taste as fresh to me as the fish served at nearby Sushi Mon.  However, I like their non-sushi dishes and will be back.  This place is tiny, so  you can't easily take a large group. I went with 4 friends and it took a while for them to get two tables and 5 chairs together."}
{"text":"For the past couple years, husband and I would come here as a little \"date night\" while our 2 eldest are in their faith formation class. We have an hour and 15 mins to kill, so why not kill it by killing some sushi.   This isn't a sushi place that offers all you can eat so don't come in expecting to AYCE it. They do have happy hours which I think is something like M-Th 4-6pm and then 10pm-1am? Then Fridays and weekends are just from 10pm-1am.  Don't quote me on it because we never make happy hour anyway. My husband is the sashimi type guy and he always loves how fresh and tender his sashimi comes out as well as how fresh his sushi tastes. You can tell their head chef takes pride in what he serves and does his best to pick the best fishes, etc...he can get his hands on.   I, on the other hand, always orders the philly tempura and the salmon skin roll. I say they have one of the better salmon skin rolls and philly tempuras. I love how they are not greedy with the salmon skin, and it isn't stale. I sure have had some chewy salmon skin at other sushi spots, but here.. oh no no. I've also tried their spicy tuna thanks to the husband and that is also deeeelish!   Their garlic edamame is delicious too! I LOVE edamame so I always appreciate edamame that isn't overcooked and properly seasoned. Also, with your order they serve a complimentary korean pancake. I LOVE that! Not only because I love korean pancakes, but impromptu date night also includes a baby and a toddler so the pancake is a sure way to shush the toddler up quick. Lol. Sure have the word love in here a lot.  What really has us coming back is not only are the sushi we order always great, but my husband loves that they offer Orion beer. It is one of his top favorite beer.  4 stars for their sushi. The rice ratio is perfect! Rice is never mushy and old tasting. The quality Chef Eric drives in regards to his fish and seafood are top notch! My only gripe is that in the hours we are able to come...it is a tad busy, so the service we receive isn't horrible, it just lacks. Getting water refilled is almost a mission and the place isn't even big at all so there shouldn't be no reason why we have to flag someone down for water, extra napkins, or even our bill.   I would never go in there with all 6 of us because the lack of space in there for our family size would be an inconvenience and I don't believe they have tables accommodating all 6 of us.   Personally, I definitely recommend giving this place a try, but I highly advise you leave infant car seats/strollers in the vehicle. If you come in with a large party, most likely you'll be seated seperately. This place is more of a chill with a couple of your friends type of spot."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I was a little disappointed in my experience here. It was ok, but not great. The lunch special was $13 and included three choices off a select menu. We received a complimentary pancake, and the lunch menu includes miso soup, which was tasty but not amazing.  The lunch menu included things like edamame and egg roll, which are so small they seem to be complete wastes of a selection. The rolls on that menu are half rolls, of course, and the bowls are 3/4 rice. The tuna roll didn't seem very flavorful to me, though I was glad to see the rolls weren't mostly rice like I've seen at a lot of places in Vegas.  The atmosphere is nice enough, it is extremely small, just the small bar area and then about 5 tables. The service is efficient and polite. I mentioned as soon as we placed our drink order that I had the yelp check-in offer for free house saki, but forgot to double check the bill and we were charged for it.  I noticed most of the amazing reviews are for the live options, so I'd like to go back and try some of them, because altogether my experience there was pleasant but didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"I sat at the sushi bar while Eric (the owner) made some of the best sushi I've had anywhere, and engaged me and my friends in great conversation. The fish is delicious and fresh and the waitresses are awesome. What else do you need?"}
{"text":"Was out doing errands with my husband and stopped here for lunch.  It was pretty delicious but our bill of $27 for two people seemed a little steep.  Since they deliver I will probably eat here again but we can't afford lunches that high very often right now.  Regardless the food was fresh, and cooked very well.  My husband's teryiaki chicken breast was some of the best I have had, although it took them forever to cook it.  I had a salmon sushi roll and a little beef teriyaki and loved that it was more like a stir fry with lots of vegetables."}
{"text":"The food was good. Fish was fresh, but the service was slow. I am not sure if it was because we were eating at 12am or not. Could have been the problem. The poppers...are"}
{"text":"Had the seaweed salad, the dynamite (appetizer), rainbow roll, and caterpillar roll. Pretty good stuff!! Tastes fresh!  Service was fast."}
{"text":"Horrible service we order o at least try to order a bake salmon the server didn't understand what we ask for ? Until I show her and him in the menu then wanted to change to either fish for salmon cuz I don't eat sithe fish they can't the second server understands better was inpatient zero costumer service they give you the feeling they are doing you a favor when you order in the end we get the food after the couple that come as 20 min later they get everything on time and us last definitely never will go back to this place"}
{"text":"Upon the chef's recommendation, a medium size sashimi plate was served.  However, it is unsatisfactory to my standard.   The temperature of the sashimi was slightly warmer than it should be; I couldn't even breakdown the tendon part of the fish by chewing. (1/5)  I didn't enjoy the dash of the kimchi sauce on one of the fish; it desensitized your taste bud to the fish.    Wasabi was either those tube or the power mixed; I expected fresh wasabi with this price.  (2.5/5)  The miso soup ,which was water down too much for taste, was complimented with tofu cube and wakame (seaweed).  (2.5/5)  Age tofu's (or fries tofu) sauce was too over-powering with sweetness; the flavor and aroma of fish flakes didn't arise to compliment the tofu.  (2/5)  The plate was chipped which should not been served for sanitation reason.  (-5/5)  Temperature is the key to the sashimi and sushi not only for the reason of taste but sanitation as well.   I may try hot dishes on the next visit to give a full judgement.     The overall service was satisfactory. 4/5"}
{"text":"Came in today for happy hour today at 4pm. The waitress was nice and the quality is great, the only thing that bothered me was that for each roll they only give you 4 pieces each. They should increase their prices and give you a traditional sushi of quantity of 8 pieces per order."}
{"text":"Our family really enjoys the careful preparation and attention each roll gets. Our go to spot for sushi !"}
{"text":"Best service I've had at a sushi restaurant, and great food! I'm pregnant and can only have cooked fish..they went out of their way to make sure everything was well done. Volcano roll was excellent.. as were the others:]"}
{"text":"I just moved To the area and have been trying different sushi places in search of a regular spot. We normally go to all u can eat spots but decided to try this one on a whim. WOW I'm so glad we did! AMAZING food and QUALITY is great!   We sat at the sushi bar, the sushi chefs were very friendly and knowledgeable. It was fun to watch them make different things and when asked about what they were making they elaborated in detail.   Everything tastes very fresh and the plum wine was delicious and was served in a neat glass.  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great sushi off the Strip. A friend had recommended Yummy to me and it is very good. And Fresh! I don't think you'll find anything bad on the menu. Staff is helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place to have delicious sushi. My favorites are the Spicy Tuna and the Spicy Yellowtail Rolls with a side of Eel Sauce. The chicken and beef lunch/dinner boxes are a delicious and are a great buy. My new go to spot for dinner especially after a good work out. The perfect protein packed meal that satisfies the hunger and doesnt leave you bloated or overly stuffed.   This place is also a great hang out. Huge plus they stay open late! Definitely my favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"This is a good sushi bar.  Other reviews say the fish is fresh and they weren't joking.  Its a small place with not much ambience, but if you're going there for good sushi, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good, reasonably priced sushi. I love it for take out. The Oh roll is one of their specialty roll. It's one I recommend if you like a lot of flavor. Good size and very satisfying. The wonton soup is perfect for a sick day."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a bento box lunch with tempura, so made my way over to Yummy Grill since it's in my 'hood.  What a nice surprise!  The service was top-notch, first of all.  I was greeted as soon as I arrived (solo), and seated right away.  I ordered the green iced tea, which was REALLY green and I felt healthier with every sip.  I had the chicken teriyaki combo bento box, which included miso soup, green salad, 4 California roll pieces, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and white rice--I ate the whole thing!  Feeling indulgent, I finished the meal off with strawberry mochi, and even that was presented with a little flair: chocolate swirls, whipped cream, and a cherry-I was one happy customer today. All the while, my waitress checked on me periodically and kept my glass full.  I will definitely return to try the sushi, for the happy service, and that fabulous green iced tea!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere. If you blink hard you'll think you are in a sushi place in Tokyo, not Vegas! Really great sushi."}
{"text":"Great Sushi. They don't offer all you can eat, so it can be pricey, but the fish is extremely fresh. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Everything was delicious. We tried a box meal with shredded beef which was great. The sashimi bowl could have had a bit more in it, but nevertheless, everything we ordered was very fresh and tasty. Our waiter, Kevin was super. This was our first time trying this place, and we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese place I come to here in Vegas, income from Florida and Chinese food here is VERY different but so far this is the only place I like. I didn't give it 5 stars because sometimes the staff forgets you're there.  There was also this time I didn't want to go to the restaurant and we ordered food for delivery (we only live 2 mins from restaurant) they took a little over an hour and when we received our food I was missing an order and had extra stuff that wasn't ordered and when I called the restaurant to inform them of the missing order they said they would bring it to me, however they never came. So if you eat I recommend going to the restaurant NO delivery."}
{"text":"This sushi place is really good. They have a bunch of sushi's I've never heard of. We ended up getting the japanese lasagna roll it was yummy it tasted pretty similar to lasagna, the one thing I didn't like about the roll was that it was pretty darn messy and we were having a hard time taking one piece out at a time. We also had the tomo devil roll, and this one was pretty yummy too, but what was a bit disappointing was that the roll wasn't as spicy as I anticipated. I'm a big fan of spicy sushi but this one wasn't spicy one bit considering the fact that it had sliced jalapenos, spicy sauce, and some spicy dipping sauce it came with. With all that it wasn't one bit spicy and I was disappointed for being false advertised. One other thing I didn't like about this place was the fact that it took a very long time to get our food, but I what I usually take into consideration is that if the foods good, it shouldn't matter how long it takes to come out. My son got the kids bento box with french fries, which was kinda weird, but hey, he loved it. Price-wise this place is decent but the portions for the price didn't fit well together.  I would come back here to try other sushi's because I saw a lot of sushi's I want to try, but the fact that I'm not from this area might keep me from coming back to this place. I sure want to give this place a benefit of the doubt and rate it higher, but it won't be fair until I try this place one more time."}
{"text":"This was our first time a Yummy Sushi and timed it for the sushi happy hour that the webpage says if from 4-6 but when we arrived we were informed it was over at 5 so we had 15 minutes to order and while the waitress was super nice she was very firm in saying any items we order after 5 would be full price.  Well so we ordered away. Salad, Cucumbers, several different rolls (4 pieces each) and the fried vegetables.  Food was great but was not enough for us so we had to order a couple more items one of which was the salad with sesame ginger dressing we did notice that the size of the salad when you pay full price was larger than the happy hour salad, not a big deal but we do feel happy hour prices should get you full size orders. We may return but this time to all sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Two words: YUM-O!!!  Couldn't wait to come back today after a long day at a lacrosse tourney.  Can't wait to come back!  Hope Aaron is here!!"}
{"text":"The service is good... But the food is not professional at all!! A big to big slice of fish in a very little rice .. The food is not so good and not so bad but you can find better sushi place"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and loved it each time.  The sushi is prepared fast and tastes good.  You can't beat the price!  The service is really good as well.  I wish there was more seating...and if you sit by the door there is a nasty breeze that hits you every time the door opens.  The nigiri is awesome!  The spider roll is well done.  My 7-Yr old loves the shrimp tempura and ate two orders!  I love the spicy tuna but wish they served spicy crab.  Everything we've tried has been delicious."}
{"text":"Best chicken teriyaki I have had in quite some time. Chicken quality excellent and sauce very good. Service very polite restaurant kept clean as well"}
{"text":"The restaurant is corky and sad but the fresh fish is dynamite!!! They have a restaurant next door but you need a reservation and it will run you $160 for a 8 course meal with the owner/ sushi chef. If you visit Yummy make sure you ask for pricing on certain items so you are not shocked when your tab arrives. I highly recommend this place for fresh and delicious raw fish."}
{"text":"This place is small but has a big menu and gr8 service.  Even the tofu is fantastic.  The rolls are well prepared and the sauces are wonderful.  Appetizers are delicious-try the jalepano one.  Salads, cooked dishes and tempura-all good.  Lunch specials are a bargain.  Bar selections are gr8.  Playboy roll, 911 roll and spicy tuna Rainbow roll are my favorites along w/I did your ex-wife.  Fish specials of the day are a must try.  Philadelphia roll is not friend as listed.  Fun servers."}
{"text":"What is the opposite word of yummy? This place is no way close to yummy.   Worst sushi I've ever had. $11 for terrible sashimi salad, no dressing, instead they used ponzu sauce. $20 for a live scallop which didn't taste fresh, $7 for their \"so-called\"  Kobe beef but so chewy. Blue fin was warm when it was served...  Lastly why does a Japanese restaurant have a Mexican chef make rolls?     How did this restaurant get 4 1/2 star on Yelp???"}
{"text":"Love this place, My daughter and I have been coming here for several years. Easy access location, small little gem in the desert. Love the freshness of all the rolls and Sashimi I've tried here. Love the deep fried ice cream and Mochi balls, Takes me back to being a kid on the island :)  Pretty decent prices and great friendly atmosphere. A little on the small side but quaint and the sushi makes up for it. We will keep coming back and we refer many people to this place. Keep up the good work! One suggestion, the complimentary \"Pancake\" is really not good at all, please have another option available, only thing i would change, otherwise A+"}
{"text":"Any sushi bar is all about quality fish and they have it here! My husband and I are from Cali and we fish for our own kitchen so we know the difference between fresh and \"sort of fresh but dressed up so you don't notice\". Had a nice conversation with Eric, the sushi chef, about fish quality and where he orders his fish from,etc. All of the staff were friendly and service was great..also they carry Asahi Black as one of their beers.....super hard to find and worth trying if you never have...Also tried the Orion beer from Okinawa...very good and also recommended ."}
{"text":"Oh, yes, I was once timid of the strip mall sushi venue but Yelp lead me here and it was close to where I stay when I first started traveling to LV 5 years ago. Boy was Yelp right.  I've always been able to get bar seats, even on a weekend night. Sushi chefs check in on you and other servers are pretty helpful. A bottle of Nagori sake is $15, which is always my go-to (enough for 2). If you check in on Yelp, let them know and they'll give the 10% discount.  They regularly have the special fish listed on the whiteboard. Get the Spanish mackerel and have them add a slice of lemon. Yum. They also usually have toro.  Rolls are described in the menu and there's a ton of them. None with mango, but otherwise all quite delicious.  I have never been disappointed and always take my traveling visitors or other guests here for Las Vegas sushi. Price is right, location is easy and the sushi is always delicious. Now I only need to make it next door for the omakase!"}
{"text":"Food taste delicious and the service is alright. Customer service needs to be improved. Be more welcoming and ethusiastic.   The prices seem to be expensive though. I was on my mobile internet looking at their menu. When i get to the store they raise mainly everything $1.00 or more. $9 for a meal is a lot to me.   I'll be going to this restaurant less often."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant online. It was rated in the top 15 of sushi restaurants in Las Vegas so we decided to try it.   We entered through a beautiful tapestry into a small and warm restaurant. The staff immediately greeted us with a smile and sat us.   The menu was huge. A little too big for my taste. I settled on a paradise roll which had coconut flakes in it. A little too sweet but overall was a fresh tasting roll. We also got a free app  which is right up my alley."}
{"text":"This sushi spot is badass, chill, great food and awesome happy hour. Only sucky part is happy hour now changed. Now min 15 dollars per person for ordering from happy hour. Before 5 bucks got u a decent meal. I love this spot and it's location just wish they would go back to their normal happy hours pricing."}
{"text":"Walking in.. The place is full. Full of satisfied customers. But seriously every time I've come here this place has been packed but they make room for you and if they can't it's worth the wait and you have the option for take out which is good for those lazy movie nights  this is a great place the service is great and on top of they're game and the food is delicious! They have similar sushi to the other places I've been too and love. That's why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"One of our best sushi experiences ever! We were visiting Vegas and craving sushi. I turned to Yelp for some realistic reviews and found Yummy Sushi had a lot of reviews AND 4+ stars so we figured we'd give it a try! We were not disappointed. Although it was our first time, we were treated like regulars! Prompt and courteous service and the food was awesome! I've never been to a place that offered live scallops, we picked our shell and 5 minutes later there was a beautifully presented scallop!  Highly recommend this place for the food and service! We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Fish is always fresh. Service is great. They know me when I come in and I love it.  I wish they had a bigger place but then I would worry about service. Yummys stay the way you are."}
{"text":"After living on the coast for so long I was nervous to try sushi in Vegas but this is hands down the best! The prices are good. I love the clam miso soup."}
{"text":"I know I have reviewed this place twice already, but this time I am reviewing because the last few times I ordered I have tried their delivery.   I must say I am so glad this place delivers! It beats the heck out of ordering pizza or something yucky, but instead something yummy!!  Sushi delivered to my door! By an always nice delivery guy!  This time I decided to try a hot dish, I got the chicken katsu, and it was very good! Also had my regular : Whats your name roll. One of the best!  Its a dream to have sushi and hand rolls, tako, and stuff like that delivered, but tasting fresh! So good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some Happy Hour sushi. I had been here previously about a year ago but somehow had forgotten about it considering its so close to my house. What a difference a year makes. This place has excellent sushi, a wide variety of specialty items, and really good prices.   I had a japanese lasagna (1/2 order) and a Washington, which is salmon and cucumber inside, and salmon and avocado outside. This was delicious and the salmon was fresh and tasty. Add a draft Asahi beer and the total came to $19 and change.  It's not a very big place, there's maybe 10 seats at the counter and another 6 tables inside. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I'll be back for sure as this is the go to place for sushi close to home."}
{"text":"Good fresh sushi.  Friendly staff and great chefs!   Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this gem for lunch.  I tried their $12.95 lunch special at the sushi bar  -- and was knocked out.  You get a choice of three items on their two-sided menu -- sashimi, sushi, noodle bowls, edamame, etc.  The food was excellent.  Lunches start with a tasty miso soup bowl.  I got the tempura bowl -- crisp shrimp and vegetables on a rice bowl.  My second item was yellow fin sashimi -- large pieces, carved before my eyes.  My third item was a spicy tuna roll -- great stuff.  The servings were very generous and filling.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Moved to the area a few weeks ago. Been here twice, and the sushi is great. Try the Playboy, Tastes like Ex GF. Service is great as well and everyone acknowledges you. The place is small but there is always a lot of people dining in. I sit at the bar for faster service.  This will most likely be my new sushi spot."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Amazing dishes, excellent raw materials and great value for money. Each dish is made carefully and makes us wonder at its wonderful taste. The sushi is delicious and high quality, and so are the other portions. The service is excellent and it seems that the restaurant owner is very involved and cares about the attitude and quality. Thank you and will come again soon."}
{"text":"I'll start off with the positive... I REALLY appreciated how Yummy (at least on paper) attempts to create creative, tasty rolls you may not find at other places,(their menu has rolls boasting lobster...scallops, hot sauced crab!.. with a playful spin on names...\"that's what she say\"...\"tastes like exgirlfriend\"..etc..  Unfortunately the talk didn't measure up to the walk.  We started with the gyoza (oddly sold as \"5\"...a strange number for a couple wishing to share)..small and heavily fried, is suspect any flavor they once had would have survived better if treated with less oil.   In fairness, the server DID give us an extra free of charge when they sensed the irony...As an attempt to try the breadth of experience at this new place for us, we ordered 4 distinctly different rolls.  Reading the menu, one has visions of overflowing crab, succulent lobster, crunchy tempura, fresh avocado, etc....yet once the rolls hit the table, we noticed a trend...ALL the rolls had the same fast food \"krab salad\"...when we asked the server where the scallops were on one roll for example, the chef replied \"it's in there!'...soon their mantra to ALL the rolls...tempura shrimp?..\"it's in there!!\"....spicy lump crab?..\"it's in there!!\"....lobster?...\"it's in there!!\"....ok, I get it!  At least they are efficient!  If you like the wool pulled over your eyes and the same old thing roll after roll, there is plenty of parking in the strip mall....if you want creative sushi, there are other places in town."}
{"text":"This was my second visit in almost two years now, whew, how time flies!  But I don't live in Vegas, so that explains why I don't come more often, but I really should, because Eric the chef and owner has kept up the quality and his passion in the food.  He has now opened up a separate dining room next to the original location, and he's focused on only the omakase now, which is good for us the diners, because you want a sushi chef who's dedicated to the craft.  The price of the omakase has now gone up to $120, but the quality has been maintained so I don't mind at all.  You do need to call ahead to reserve for omakase.  I called the night of, luckily someone else had cancelled so I was accommodated.  So happy!  I remain convinced that this is the best sushi I've had in the US for the money you pay.  And when you find out the chef is preparing your fish with a $4000 knife, that $120 you're paying for the meal seems so worth it haha."}
{"text":"Far and away my favorite sushi place in town. No AYCE, but still worth going to. They have the highest quality sushi I've ever tasted, and some very good special rolls. If you like spice, try their.. I think it's called Dragon roll or something. It comes with jalapeño slices on top, and is very tasty and pretty spicy.  A+ from me for this place, and I've been suggesting it to everyone I know who likes sushi."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, friendly staff, good service.  Those oysters are gooood!  This is a hidden gem in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Telling them I was vegan, my tofu dish ended up tasting like meat I'm pretty sure due to the fact that they cooked it along with some meat dish.   I could taste meat in my tofu dish that I couldn't eat my dish after the first bite.  Customer service is also terrible.  The whole hour I was there, the server was gone for the whole 45 minutes, hence me having to stand from my seat just to ask the workers behind the counter for more refreshments, rice, etc.  Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best sushi place in Vegas I have found. The staff is very attentive and friendly. The Sushi Chef at the bar is entertaining and will try to get to know you. He will always remember you when you come in again. The sushi is amazing! Very clean place."}
{"text":"Really fresh sashimi and eel! We ordered the rainbow roll $10, eel bowl $13, sashimi salad $11 and red snapper teriyaki combination $14! Everything was delicious! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Our favorite happy hour spot!  Try their garlic edamame, cucumber salad and any of their delicious rolls.. had to visit 2 nights in a row because their dishes were so flavorful!"}
{"text":"Very good and fresh. Wonton soup is amazing! And all the chicken dishes are white meat. Fried rice is excellent. We drive half way across town to eat here because it's that good. Excellent service. Only complaint is I wish there was more seating because it's always busy."}
{"text":"We are here to celebrate my husband birthday. I am very enjoy the food.It's very fresh and delicious. We had lobster sashimi and fresh and etc.."}
{"text":"Came here with my homie and his wife from Hawaii looking to eat some good sushi. I got a recommendation from a fellow coworker so it had to be good. I tell you this place did not disappoint.   We started out with a very good bottle of sake, I forgot the name. We had the toro- best melt taste of all! amaebi - sweetest shrimp that I ever had blue fun tuna - super soft meat  live scallop - fresh as it can get abalone - one of the best I had uni - creamiest uni up to date hairy crab - awesome tasting of crab with high price to it They also offer other live items and they have imported fish.   Overall great experience. The staff was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable about the menu. The chef was friendly also even cheered sake with us! Sushi was top of the line the best I've had. Not even back home in Hawaii compares to this place's sushi! I have yet to find one.  If you want the best quality sushi super friendly staff and service, this place is it! Their sushi will blow your taste buds outta this world!"}
{"text":"This my second time here and I am not disappointed. I know why they call it Yummy. When we arrived at  7.00 pm it was empty within 15 minutes people were waiting inline for a table as everything was full. Now I KNOW why. Great food"}
{"text":"Worst tofu ever...I think they cut up a dish sponge and put it in sauce...threw the dish out..."}
{"text":"My man and I go to Yummy grill about twice per week. Everyone I bring ends up becoming a regular. The fish is the freshest and best high quality selection in Vegas- bar none! Eric is the bomb. You WILL NOT be disappointed!!! My man came in eating california rolls and now he's a sashimi buff. Thank god for this place"}
{"text":"This place has a nice variety and is great for a quick meal.  I've eaten in but usually do take-out.  The sushi is good (not fabulous 5-star stuff, but quite good) and the quality is very consistent which can be hard to find.  The Chinese is a tad greasy but delicious, I love the fried rice, and the portions on the Chinese are generous.  Tip: If ordering sushi to-go, ask for extra soy sauce.  I always seem to need more than what they put in the bag by habit."}
{"text":"three words - brown rice sushi!!!!   awesome!!! its a little extra for them to make it with brown rice but so worth it in my opinion. service was also excellent, we will def be coming back here on our next trip to Vegas. the only bad thing is that there is not too much seating inside, maybe about 6 tables.  we were lucky and scored a table but they were busy the entire time we were there.   ordered the california crunch roll (california roll with tempura flakes on it) and the hawaiian roll (spicy tuna with avocado and tuna on top). also got some teri beef (yum!) and teri salmon (yum!). all our dishes were delicious and the prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"I don't care for sushi however my significant other does!   He loves the sushi here and I love the vegetable tempura... I will definitely return.  The service is good also."}
{"text":"I make sure to visit Chef Eric every time I'm in Vegas. I drool just thinking about the omakase! Chef Eric is not only a great chef but quite a humorous one as well! Omakase is chef's choice, it is pricier than ordering a few rolls but trust me, it is the best Japanese food ever! From the uni to the wagyu... I die just thinking about it! Make sure to make reservations for omakase! It's definitely an experience you don't want to miss out on!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. Awesome service. Such a friendly staff. And the chefs know my order and remember my allergies."}
{"text":"I came in today for my first time to get take out. The service was fast and friendly... Very heavy on the sauces topping my sushi rolls but over all good."}
{"text":"Worst sushi restraunt I've ever been to I paid 15$ for 4 slices of sushi. Service is terrible I would not recommend anyone here at all."}
{"text":"My thanks again to the fantastic team at Yummy's.   Staff is always friendly and happy to offer suggestions for \"something different \".  Check out this little gem.  you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am kicking myself in the booty for not having completed a review for this place and this is my go to place for Sushi and bento boxes for almost 4 years. I first stumbled upon this place when I worked up the street and wanted sushi for lunch. Since I live nearby too, whenever I wanted a quick roll or two, ok it's always two, (don't judge me) I would come here. The prices are decent and the food freshness is one of the better ones in town for sure. The workers are very hospitable. Keep in mind, this place is very small so you will feel a little squished. I always get the crunchy California rolls and California rolls, my parents get the bento boxes and my lil one gets her Tuna rolls. We are never disappointed when we leave. They do offer AYCE but for some reason the two rolls always seem to fill me up just fine. It's a great neighborhood restaurant to visit when you are in the need for a Japanese food fix."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  Came for dinner the other night, and quickly wanted to comment on the baked dishes.  (Since I am pregnant and must abstain from raw dishes- it gave me a chance to try other items from the menu).   Although I was salivating watching my husband enjoy his spicy tuna hand roll, and a complimentary sushi that the chef prepared for him- my volcano roll and seaweed salad were DELICIOUS.   We also shared a Red Snapper Teriyaki combination box and we practically licked that plate clean.  Perhaps when I am no longer pregnant, I will order a baked dish again.  Who am I kidding? I am craving their uni and ame ebi like crazy!"}
{"text":"So we were in town for Thanksgiving visiting the in-laws and our first night in town, Wednesday, my brother in-law asked what type of food we wanted for dinner. My answer is always \"Sushi!\" my brother in-law is also a big sushi lover and since he lives in Vegas knows the best places to go. So Wednesday night he took us to Yummy. So appropriately named. I checked off on the sheet of paper they give you exactly what I wanted but in the end my brother in-law took over and ordered a platter of sashimi, my favorite, and some food for the mother in-law and her bf and I actually forget what my husband ordered. Everything was so fresh and delicious and the staff was wonderful. The sushi chef actually put fresh wasabi on our platter. I have never had fresh wasabi, I've only had the paste. OMG...where has it been all my life?!! I seriously need a vat of that stuff. It was so incredibly good. The sushi chef also sent us out some grilled seafood...so good!   Next time I'm in Vegas I am so hitting Yummy up again!"}
{"text":"First time here and the fish is very fresh. Add the great service and its five stars!"}
{"text":"Yummy grill & sushi , they service not be nice we feel unhappy in there We check the food in yelp look good and delicious but"}
{"text":"This place is great. Very chill atmosphere, friendly staff, and deliciously fresh sushi."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to grab some lunch. The place is pretty small but cozy. We choose to sit at the sushi bar and were greeted right away by the sushi chefs.   We ordered off of the lunch menu and for the price the portion of lunch we both chose was perfect. I chose the unagi bowl with gyoza and a spicy crab roll. The lunch special came with miso soup as well.   Everything was portioned really well and I was actually able to finish my entire mean. I thought the price was fair and thought the eel was made really well. I would come back for lunch again if I was on this side of town."}
