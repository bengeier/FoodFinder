{"text":"I LOVE Mr. Hunans, he delivers quickly and efficiently and the pricing is not too bad.  There are some website issues but i just call in the order and they are very responsive.  The drivers were nice but they had trouble finding my suite.  As far as quality goes its good and enough so to make it my consistent Chinese food spot."}
{"text":"Man, what can I say about Mr. Hunan's? The food is sub par but the entertainment is great. The decorations insinuate that it's Christmas year round, and boy, does it feel like it! The yellow walls make me uneasy. Those girls really know how to dance too. They get down on the half stage next to where you order. If you tip well enough you get the tip, you know? Ask about the items that are off the menu, it's where all their best \"dishes\" are. Remember it either comes with a soda or an \"egg roll\". Go for the second one, you'll get farther. The abundance of plastic forks also makes me uneasy. I once saw someones head stick down out of the loose ceiling panel in the right corner of building while looking at a fire sprinkler, that really made me uneasy. Anyways I really like this place sometimes. The employees want to give everyone jello shots to get us all way more hyped but they can't at this 5 star establishment. Yeah. It's really good for kids, they don't like them. Be sure to make reservations on the weekends. On monday they have poker."}
{"text":"Mr. Hunan is the best kept vegetarian Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix valley.  The staff is always super friendly, the delivery is super fast, and their tofu is always cooked to perfection.  I'm not sure why there are so many poor reviews on here, as I have never had a bad experience.  (Although I've also only ever had their vegetarian dishes.)  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Don't. Ever. Ever ever ever! Eat there. The shrimp fried rice was not nice. It consisted of mostly rice. I found 2 peas and 1 carrot chunk in the whole thing. The shrimp was old and not fresh and it was nasty but my dog liked it then again he also likes cat poop..."}
{"text":"Save your money, the lunch special BBQ pork was terrible. The fried rice was Brown with onions in it. The place is old and thank goodness for college students, if not it would be out of business."}
{"text":"Did not answer the phone on multiple attempts. They say they're open on Sundays from 11:30am to 9:30pm, am I missing something? Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I should have known better based on other reviews--learn from my mistakes!  Customer service: 1 star. The dude who took my delivery order was really rude. Whatever.  Speed: 1 star. 50 minutes to deliver on a Monday afternoon, but still, that seems to be the norm based on other reviews.  Taste: 0 stars. Gross. I ordered the Orange Tofu, General Tso's Tofu, and Egg Fried Rice. The sauce of both of the tofu dishes were really similar, like they just added more soy sauce to the General Tso's. Both sauces were really gelatinous  and just tasted really low quality. I also felt terrible after I ate them.   Just don't."}
{"text":"This place is not bad at all. Not sure about the bad reviews, Ive placed many orders with this place and will continue to. I like the combo dinners, its a good amount of food esp for the price. Chef specials are perfect size if your having company. The soups are really good too, my only issue is that everything could use a lil more flavor, lil more spice, its just missing something. The Staff is nice too, again never any issues."}
{"text":"This place is a dump and the food isnt much better.  The prices used to be cheap but they almost doubled the price of some menu items.  They do have a good selection of vegetarian food.  I would order this place pick up or delivery if I had to eat here again which I hope never happens. 2 stars at best. AVOID if possible"}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard takeout, a little bland for the most part. They do have the option of getting your veggies steamed if you don't want grease, watching your weight or whatever.  Last time I went, my roommate ordered \"vegetarian spring rolls.\" When she bit into it, it was full of pork. She took it back up to the woman and told her what happened and she said it was our fault because they only make pork SPRING rolls. the vegetarian ones are EGG rolls. It was obviously just a communication issue and could've been remedied easily. Instead, she was very rude about it and refused to replace them, saying it was our mistake for ordering the wrong thing.  If they had handled it better, I would still go back there. C'est la vie"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is great, not cheap but worth the price. Small building with a few tables, we usually get it to go."}
{"text":"This place is not bad for a quick lunch. Huge portions are a plus. However, there was the one time when I waited half an hour for Orange Chicken to go. When I asked about it, the red-headed guy at the counter (yes, I'm calling you out) says \"Oh, yeah. It's right here.\" The food was ready a long time ago, and nobody bothered to let me know. And yes, every other person that was there before and after me had their food handed to them. Thanks."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating Mr.Hunan for years and this is by far our favorite Chinese take out!! Most take out doesn't compare to this little authentic place, always steaming hot food and they have many healthy options.  The place is small and not a lot of decor but it's great take out!! we even like to go sit in there sometimes because it just has such a small joint type of feel!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Chicken Fried rice was on point!! only negative star would be that the delivery guy (not sure if it was a GH driver or a driver from Mr. Hunan). He was nice and all, but he tried to sell me his mixtape, he went on about how he made beats. Pretty annoying."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place one more time, after my first two, times there. Well third time is a charm. I ordered the easiest thing to make. Chicken, fried rice.  When I got it home it, was pork fried rice with added  over cooked chicken. And the rice was from an earlier order. they had made cause it was cold. Oh did, I mention I don't eat pork our red meat. So how did I place the wrong order?  They made me another order and it was, fresh but tasted like ughhh. Ive tried all the, places, from priest to mill on university for Chinese. I, would avoid them all..not worth the cash wasted. The frozen chinese at walmart is better than this stuff. Buyer Beware"}
{"text":"Their vegetable fried rice was not my favorite at all! Thought I would be getting something like Panda Express but I got huge chunks of vegetables in my rice...so I did not like it. Also didn't care for their vegetable egg rolls...wish it was actually egg roll wraps and not spring roll wraps....Gave 2 star since i did like their egg drop soup"}
{"text":"We ordered food last night for delivery and didn't receive it for 2 hours. We actually ended up leaving to go get dinner somewhere else because we were tired of waiting and sick with hunger. When we called the first time (after waiting an hour) they assured us they were on their way and would be there shortly. 40 minutes later we called again and no one answered. They called us finally 2 hours after the order was placed to tell us they were at our house and seemed upset that we didn't want the food anymore and were definitely unapologetic about making us wait so long. If you order delivery definitely plan to pay cash just incase they don't show!"}
{"text":"Looking for an affordable meal for the whole family? Hunan has you covered. A late-night snack in a lovely park-like setting after a night out with friends? Hunan's got that too!  A place you can take all the kids, or even grandma? Yup, Hunan's got that too.  5 star service with 1 star prices? You better believe Hunan has that.  Hunan's is a hidden gem in every sense of the word, I would, and have recommended Hunan to friends and co-workers many times over.  Want it? \"Hunan has it\".  Food leaves alot to be desired."}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone for delivery and it was Literally, the worst. I love Chinese. It takes a lot for it to be taste bad to me. But this was almost inedible. The rice looked like potatoes it was so overlooked. I then noticed they gave me wontons instead of pot stickers (which were burnt by the way, I probably would've chocked if id even tried to eat it.) anyways I called back and told them they messed it up and they acted as if it was my fault. Ignored me. I finally went up there and got my dumplings and left the burnt wontons on the counter so he could eat them. I HATE BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Good friendly and convenient. Order on weekends frequent and yelp needs more written so im typing more letters...."}
{"text":"Best Chinese Delivery in Tempe. Broccoli shrimp is delicious. Do not order online thou. My order did not go thru and I had to call it in."}
{"text":"The food was cold when I got it and it didn't taste right the spring rolls were soggy and not good sorry."}
{"text":"So this was my first time eating here and the girls at work ordered us food from there.. We only ordered 4 lunch specials.. Well they told us 30 to 45 minutes. We ordered our food at 11AM and our food got here around 12:40PM. When we called to see what was taking so long, the phone would just ring and ring and ring and ring and ring and NO ANSWER! At first I thought they scammed us because we couldn't get a hold of anyone. When the food finally got here, my appetite was hanging by a thin hair. So the food was kind of cold and mushy. The white rice was overcooked and the orange chicken was too bready. I won't be eating there again. They need to hire some more help and stop being cheap."}
{"text":"WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST EAT. yes i was hungry but this food is so bad i bet white people are their chefs. our pork fried rice tastes like brown rice with dried grey meat in it and the chicken lo mein had just chicken and a carrot , ONE fucking CARROT . these people don't deserve to own a restaurant and call it Mr.Hunan"}
{"text":"Prices are great, food is ehhh. Would I come back? Most likely not. Not the best shrimp fried rice I've tasted. I can say delivery took about 45 minutes like it stated it would."}
{"text":"First time here. I can say so far there are better chinese restraunts in the area. It was a little difficult to communicate my order. We waited inside and it didnt take long to bring our order out. When we checked they had messed up our order rice was wrong and im sure general tso chicken doesnt look like what i got. We just left without comlaining, but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yummiest sweet and sour shrimp I've had in a LONG time. The BEST spring rolls!! And the sweetest gentleman delivered my meal :)"}
{"text":"i can order online....YES! however, average. they don't have a house hot mustard, which pisses me off as i hate those little packets of radioactive yellow goo that try to pass off as hot mustard. i've ordered the kung pao beef twice and liked it. got the crab puffs last time, and they weren't bad either.  i really wish i'd read the reviews before ordering though. i'm glad my food experience was better than some, but the conditions of the restaurant sound a little disturbing. i DO think it's sad that there's a bed there, that sucks...at least he's not on the street, right?  anyhow, i'll probably have to venture in and check it out for myself. if it's as bad as other reviewers say, i will definitely update and not order takeout from there."}
{"text":"Only tried two items here, but i do like the fact that they offer a small size of entrees as well as large size. You can tell alot about a place by their fried rice. The vegetable fried rice was excellent with fresh cut mushrooms and other veggies and not just frozen peas and carrots. The $1.25 egg roll was not good though, although perhaps they gave me a spring roll instead because the wrapper was not egg roll style. Could possibly try the real food here at some point, but rice was a good start."}
{"text":"All 4 stars are based solely on their Orange Tofu. By far the best tofu I've ever had. It's a big enough order to eat off of for 3 days (unless you're sharing) and I recommend ordering Chow Mein noodles to go along with it.  Other than that... Mr. Hunan ain't nothin' fancy. Panda Express has a waaaay better atmosphere and that's not saying much ;)"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here is great.  Prices are very reasonable. Few things are over $9 and many are about $6.   Love the shrimp fried rice with a very fair amount of medium size shrimp.  Appreciate that they deliver and our fast for only a $1 fee.  They have a wide delivery area also so at home or work I can order.    I highly recommend you try their food. They say it's New York Style. I just know its darn good!  Every month I order from them a couple of times."}
{"text":"Best Chinese delivery in Tempe. Not sure why there are so many bad reviews, I've only ever had good experiences. Fast and friendly delivery with really great prices and good food."}
{"text":"Not only not impressed but will not be coming back. Right by my work & I wanted Almond chicken. The sauce was congealed brown jello like sauce & rice was tasteless.It was so bad I ordered an eggroll because I knew I would still be hungry...They called me up to get my eggroll but failed to give me any sweet & sour sauce which I then had to ask for.This place should sell other stuff ...not food because they clearly couldnt care less if you like your food or not!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this Chinese restaurant to delivery or take out. The sweet and sour chicken is my favorite in Tempe, it's always crispy and never soggy! I've ordered delivery from the Yelp app several times and never had a problem. This is my go to spot for your typical Chinese takeout, it's quick, yummy, and makes for the best left overs! I also love that I can order all my food without have to call or talk to anyone!"}
{"text":"Food is somewhat decent but they are good with not listening to their customer's orders. I ordered a chicken teriyaki and Hunan shrimp on a very slow Sunday evening. When I got home after picking up the food, I realized that the shrimp was missing and it was filled with chicken. I called them back and told them they mixed the order up but they told me that I clearly said Hunan chicken. I know what I said and I clearly said Hunan shrimp because I even looked it up on google before I ordered it. But oh well what can they do but to blame it on me."}
{"text":"just got back from lunch.  ordered the sesame chicken and crab wontons.  both were very good. i decided to eat my food there because i was bored with work.  the place is nothing special on the inside.  small, bright and a little messy.  anyways....i thought the food was great (large portions) but i will probably order take out next time."}
{"text":"Great home cooked Chinese food I was impressed that many things are fresh and not frozen or pre bought.  The dumplings are home made chicken wings are out of this world. Unfortunately their son with the 2 tone hair and dazed and confused look on his face is useless. He adds 20 minutes to every order by either sleeping or playing on his cell phone He should be replaced with someone that cares and actually shows up to work. He losses his attitude and develops an interest in his parents business and they get 5 stars.  Replace the child and hire an adult who cares !!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, along with good Mexican food, there aren't many good Chinese restaurants in Tempe.  Given this, Mr. Hunan is a great place to get a cheap fix for your Chinese food cravings.  But here's the thing, the prices are cheap, and one reason is that it is a \"no frills\" type of place.  Do not expect ambience, don't expect fancy plates and cutlery...don't even expect real plates and cutlery...in fact, during the summer they try to keep the costs down by not running the AC too strong...so the best thing to do is order take out or delivery.  But, despite all that, the food will be good, fresh, and won't leave a big dent in your wallet.  You will definitely get your money's worth!  In comparison, the prices are comparable to something like Panda Express, but the food is much better."}
{"text":"Amazing! Better than panda. Great customer service! Amazing food. Clean restaurant! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places since moving here.  But just placed another order to yet find it to be lacking.  This time it was Sweet & Sour Chicken and it was more fried dough then any meat and the rice was without flavor.  The last few times I have gone the quality has continually been going down hill and prices are still high.  Use to be worth it, not now."}
{"text":"Never being here before but had an urge to try even though I don't eat any meat. I asked for a dish containing pork, chicken and shrimp but asked for no meat, extra veggies. The veggies were plentiful and of a large assortment, the spices were just right, no need to add anything at all. The cashier was also the person to bring me my food and was very nice, especially when it came to me ordering a dish in a way it was never intended to be prepared. The meal was filling and extremely tasty! I'll be back very soon.. I almost forgot the two awesome fortune cookies I got, these are keepers!"}
{"text":"I got take out and they were pretty quick which earned them an extra star. This is your basic Chinese food take out. Nothing really stood out but I also didn't find any extra protein in my food which is the horror story so often you hear about places like this. I got to say though I liked their chicken wings but the szechuan isn't spicy. Its actually very affordable for lunch which is awesome because my other options when I forget my lunch gets super pricy when I need it delivered."}
{"text":"First time, last time.  Knew something wasn't right as soon as the kind delivery guy handed me the food.  Something smelled not right and it was the szechuan beef.  It smells like mystery meat, and the mystery continues to haunt us.  The won ton soup is doughy.  The shrimp fried rice was good, but not what fried rice usually tastes like (more like white rice with shrimp and onions).  Best part of the meal was fried cream cheese won tons, which were adequately tasty.  Kung pao shrimp had peanuts, not the usual cashews and was edible, but not enticing.  After a few bites, we threw the entire dinner away.  We have high hopes for the wrapped fortune cookies though."}
{"text":"If you are looking for gourmet Chinese food in a sketchy Tempe strip mall, then don't go here.  However, if you live close by and want some relatively inexpensive, decently tasting and quick takeout Chinese food, then this is your place.  I live about a mile away and this is our go-to place when we want something quick and easy to pickup on our way home from work.  You can call them up, order whatever you want, and within 5-10 minutes it is ready for pickup.  Sure the people who answer the phones there don't speak perfect English and it is difficult as heck to communicate with them sometimes, but this means the food is truly authentic, right?  My wife and I often order the special wonton or the hot and sour soup to go with what we are making for dinner at home.  Once in a while we will get a full meal to take back.  We have discovered that you can order just about any of their non-fried dishes and have them put the sauce on the side.  More Chinese food places should do that because all the dishes are basically just stir fry with different veggies, meat and sauce thrown in.  Anyway,  since we are trying to eat healthy this is a solid option.  I also really like their spare ribs which is probably not the healthiest of options, but oh well."}
{"text":"I ate in location and the only positive I can say is that it appeared clean. But downhill from there! There was a guy sleeping on a makeshift bed right next to the register, GROSS :/ I didn't wait long for my food, 7-10 mins, but I would have expected hot food for such short time. I order Honey Chicken and paid for upgraded fried rice which was cold and bland. I didn't eat more than three bites of the rice. The chicken was the worst quality of chicken I've ever been served anywhere! My entire experience was so bad that I wasted $12 for an unappealing meal and ended up next door for real food. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY :("}
{"text":"My chicken skewers were dried out fatty and rubbery. The chicken Lo mein had breaded chicken in it with no flavor. Everything was super salty."}
{"text":"One star because the service was good. The food was the most awful Hunan I have eaten.  Sauce on the orange tofu was a gelatinous mess. Rice wasn't terrible, but I could not stomach to eat more than a few bites of the tofu."}
{"text":"This place kind of scares me.  It used to be scarier, but right now it's still a little odd.  When you walk in, it'll be silent for a long time, no one there.  It makes me think of if The Shining took place in an Asian restaurant.  You hear a strange rattling, rustling of pages or maybe fingers running along wooden bars.  You peak over the counter and there's a baby in a crib behind a partition.  Okay.  Bringing a baby to work is fine, but where are you?  You ring the bell on the counter and maybe a minute later a really sleepy, but pleasant enough gentleman will take your order.  There used to be this girl who worked there who had a permanent snarl on her face, a wrinkled nose and upturned, pissed-off lip.  She might not have been making a face, she might have just... you know, just looked that way, but she terrified me.    The food is overall pretty decent.  I mean, it's not earth shattering but it's Pan-Asian Cuisine.  It's got broccoli, rice and meat served with sweet and sour sauce.  The prices are cheap and you end up getting a lot, too.  The lights flicker in there like crazy so it's best to get your order to go or else you'll end up feeling pretty nauseous."}
{"text":"aside from the website issues (minimum order amount is faulty, and it just being down or not functional...)  this little place has the best chinese food delivery in tempe.  quick, and suprisingly fresh and tasty.  also, big portions.  i remember years ago, i lived right next door and it wasn't as good. on a whim, after a few poor meals from other chinese places round this side of town, i decided to order online again.  now, i usually order 1-3 times a week, and unfortunately have to call it in as the website has gone sour (hence 4 stars, not 5.)     the fried dumplings (potstickers,) are really legit, and the lunch combos are awesome. ive tried most of them.    the hotnsour isn't so great, but if you need a quick fix of chinese food (esp the lo mein,  and the blackbeansauce or broccoli stuff, are great...)    i work about 3 miles from the place, and at lunch i can get delivery usually under 30 mins."}
{"text":"Order takeout/delivery from here often. It's delicious every time and quick service! Always get the hunan beef and fried rice."}
{"text":"I've been going to mr Hunan since my college days (a long time) and I'm so glad this great restaurant is still around. Quick, delicious food wig all whit meat chicken and great service"}
{"text":"Such a terrible experience here I don't recommend it to ANYBODY. Unfriendly service. The restaurant has a god awful stench of B.O. Took them 15 minutes to make one container of PLAIN fried rice. literally just rice.. AND i Found a long black hair in it when I got home to top it all off. Will never eat here ever ever ever again i'm traumatized. Wish i could give less than one star"}
{"text":"Really was hoping this place would rock since its right next to the best laundromat ever!   Guys behind the counter at first didn't even seem to care we came in (we were the only ones in there) but then they were friendly enough.   Food was average priced (just under $18 for two dinners, no drinks) and came out fast.  We left to go tend to laundry and sat to eat our food. My cashew chicken was made with peanuts instead... wrong dish or bad disguise? Fiancee got the bourbon chicken of some kind. Flavor was good but the cuts of chicken were pretty bad. Stringy and fatty. Fried rice was just fluffy white rice with nothing in it. Egg rolls were good.  So overall... meh. Could be good though!"}
{"text":"Annoying when you are at the mercy of the restaurant delivery and they don't  get your order right. I was completely disappointed because not one thing came as ordered and they did not even include soy sauce packets in my delivery. I do understand there are worse things but it would be nice after travelling all day to get a great meal and thought this had pretty good YELP reviews.   My order with notes -  1 Vegetable Egg Roll (greasy and stale tasting), 1 Bean Curd Vegetable Soup - Please use vegetarian broth! (came with chicken broth and lots of green peppers), 1 Vegetable Chow Mein Fun - no onions and no green peppers please! (yup, you guessed it onions) - see photos. No dinner for me tonight."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. I heard lots of good things about it from friends at work. I had the the General Tso Chicken. About 20 minutes later I broke out in hives."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food delivery. I hated this places food, I ordered at 9:00 ($17) worth of food I got teriyaki chicken fried rice, egg drop wonton soup and crab cream cheese wontons. The guy showed up at 10:20 and was like sorry we had a busy night. After waiting that long you would hope the food would be delicious, it was the worst Chinese food I've ever had the chicken looked like it wasn't enable and I tasted it and it was nasty, the rice looked like potatoes and had no flavor I couldn't eat any of my main entree, the egg drop wonton soup was nasty and made me feel sick the only good thing I got were the wontons... Great ya never ordering here again"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Really like the orange chicken combo meal. Can't go wrong. Sweet n sour pork-no pineapple's or green pepper's,but not bad..."}
{"text":"I had the sesame chicken,  lots of food but not anything special.  Heavy breaded chicken in a sweet and sour sauce with sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I found myself in Tempe this Saturday with a friend, it was late afternoon and we were both really hungry, we were looking for a Chinese buffet / stir fry restaurant. I knew of a few but the few from years ago when I lived down here, unfortunately they were all closed.  We saw mr Hunan out of the corner of our eyes and decided to give it a try.  The staff was nice I ordered the Hunan chicken which was ok at best, I thought it would be better assuming it was their signature dish. Sadly I think even pei Wei has more flavor.   The other thing that rubbed me the wrong way was their fountain soda machine was broken.  This kind of thing could cause a lot of customers not to come back especially when given the number of choices in the area.   I say Mr Hu-nah... thanks"}
{"text":"This place is decent although a bit sketchy. You might get shaken down for some quarters outside but it comes with the territory in this strip mall. A perfect place to catch some grub while you are waiting in your car for the laundry to finish at Clean Spin Laundromat. I wouldn't say it's the best Chinese food but after trying much of the fare in Tempe, I would say it is a safe choice. Pot stickers are actually fried dough, not frozen battered crescents."}
{"text":"I should have paid attention to the warnings.... YUCK. Rice was good, and tons of it."}
{"text":"Its a nice little quiet spot for lunch. Price is very reasonable and the food portions are big. Food was very flavorful and the lunch special comes with either a drink or egg roll"}
{"text":"I'm not sure when the standards for Chinese food became so lax. I can remember going to so many good Chinese restaurants when I was younger, but it now it seems most every time I try a new one I'm disappointed.  I hate to be so critical of Mr. Hunan--a mostly takeout joint--because the people behind the counter were very friendly, but the food was so oily and bland that it's hard to describe. I mean, it's hard to make \"Hot and Sour Soup\" neither hot nor sour, but my try of this famous soup at Mr. Hunan revealed that it was indeed possible.  My main dish fared no better. In fact, it was so bland I've forgotten exactly what it was that I ordered!   Come on, Mr. Hunan, this is the Southwest! We're not scared of some spice!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered from here has been pretty good. I will often stop here when I don't feel like cooking and the food comes out fast. The atmosphere isn't the greatest, but I'd you're doing take out that shouldn't be an issue."}
{"text":"Okay.  So I've been going here two years now. It was always speedy delivery, good food, and good service. But lately, in the last few months, the staff has changed. Delivery takes forever and the food is not nearly as good as it used to be. Food will be cold when delivered too. The only person I still recognize is the short delivery guy with the glasses. He's nice. The others, all kind of weird. This place is overrun with hipsters, it's like a den. Normally I wouldn't care but the quality of this place and it's service has gone down since. I'll be trying new Chinese restaurants from now on."}
{"text":"You have got to be fucking kidding me.  There was no one in the restaurant. the place was a graveyard, yet no one thought it was important to wipe the tables or even sweep the floor. Crumbs and sticky stains everywhere. i ordered take-out before I got a good look at the place. While I waited for my order I looked around for a place to sit - no clean chairs. All had crumbs on them. Tables had folded-up pieces of cardboard shoved underneath the legs, balancing them out. One table had THREE cardboard balancers. All the chairs have chipped paint. There are stacks of sodas with a stained apron tossed onto the top of them - better wipe those bitches down good before you slurp, people!! The license on the wall reads 2008. HOLY GOD THIS IS 2010! There is a BED that's not even hidden from view. Toothbrush and toothpaste and a shoerack! Damn, put that in the BACK ROOM not the FRONT if you so desperately need to do it. And give me a break - how busy can this place possibly get, that you need to sleep there overnight??? I shudder to think what the back kitchen looks like if they can't even pretend to make the dining area presentable.  Even my dog wouldnt eat there... but since he's missing a leg, he might need to steer clear of this place before they try to stew him up. BTW I AM ASIAN so keep the racist accusations to yourselves, white weirdos.  Okay, all joking aside: the place is GODDAMN DIRTY. PERIOD."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised with the orange tofu. It has a nice, slight spiciness, slivers of fresh orange peel, and it isn't too sweet. The prices and location are really good and they have very fast service. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I have been taking out food from Mr. Hunan for over 20 years, for myself and for friends.  After the elderly Chinese guy retired and sold the restaurant years ago, there have been a few owners, yet the place has been consistently good.  The cost is very reasonable and the portions generous.  I only order vegetarian food and I was glad the newest owner added spring rolls to the lunch menu.  None of my friends have been unhappy about the food, whether vegetarian or containing meat."}
{"text":"Totally decent and efficient take out! They still use the cute little red and white boxes for the rice which is important to me for some reason..."}
{"text":"Right next to my apt.  They know my orders and they are consistent with their food.  Yay for Mr.  Hunan"}
{"text":"Agreed with the rest of the reviews which I should have read first. Steamed won tons dry, tough, and bland; chow mien noodles overcooked, bland, dry; shrimp tasted old and fishy and like the mud vein wasn't cleaned out; portion sizes on the small size for the typical Chinese restaurant although they were enough. I usually like to have some left for lunch the next day. Mongolian beef was also bland and barely spicy for a spicy dish.  On the positive side, we received 2 egg-rolls that we didn't order.  The price was probably average but very high for the quality of food received.   We were quoted 30-45 minutes but it took about an hour to be delivered.  Overall disappointed and will definitely be trying somebody else next time."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing service. I mean really, really bad.  We placed an order for delivery at 6:30 pm on a Tuesday night, not the busiest night of the week, I'm sure. We were given an estimate of 30-40 minutes. After an hour my husband called to make sure our order wasn't forgotten. The young girl on the phone said that they were very busy and the driver was on his way to our house (less than a mile from the restaurant) at that time and should arrive in 10 minutes. After another 30 minutes we called back and asked to please cancel the order, after 1 1/2 hours we no longer wanted the food. The girl on the phone shouted at my husband that none of this was her fault and was reluctant to cancel our order. She wanted to charge us for food we never received!  The food is just not good enough for such poor service. If 18 year old college students can't answers phones and take simple orders don't hire them. It's simple."}
{"text":"Let me just say that about a year ago this place was decent, however that has now changed. I spent 30 mins on the phone trying to get through to place my order and no one pick up( should have been my first clue) Next i placed the order on line then i called the restaurant again to see where my food was. The guy told me that it was on the way, cut to 1 hour later they finally picked up the phone again only to tell me that they just got my order and that he can cook it right now. Do I still want it or what???  I asked for the manager he sd \"hello\" like he didn't hear me. The guy said that his name was Danny ( yeah Right) and informed me that he would go cook my food right now, and that it would be here in about another HOUR. I asked for the manager again nothing. I then advised him that I would do what I'm doing right now, go straight to Yelp about this he hung up the phn...... I called Hunan express instead."}
{"text":"I just got my order of Chow Mien and its all dry noddles and dry chicken. No sauce or flavor or anything. Few pieces of veggies but not enough. The dumpling dough is so thick its not completely cooked through so its inedible. It just tastes like wet flour. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Average take out. Good size portions for the lunch specials. Very high on the sodium levels so be sure to drink a lot of water. The beef broccoli was decent. Pretty greasy but it's Chinese so I'll deal. Love the eggrolls."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Still waiting on getting my money back. I ordered online at 740 and was told that it would be delivered with 30-45 minutes. At 845 I called and was told delivery would be 10 minutes. 10 minutes later I call again and am told by someone in VERY broken English that order will take another 30 minutes. 30 additional minutes after the 70 minutes I had already waited is asinine.  I told them I wanted my money back and kept getting different stories from the two guys I was talking to. They were definitely playing the \"I don't speak English well\" card to try to get me to concede without a refund. Every yelp review on here is on point. I'm not sure how they're still in business but I'm sure they won't be for long.  Side note: It took over a week to receive my refund for an order they cancelled on me."}
{"text":"Our order was supposed to arrive between 12:05-12:15 we finally got our food at 12:45. After calling to see where our order was. The rice was mushy. We got 2 little packets of soy sauce for three orders. One sweet and sour sauce for 3 egg rolls. I ordered the general Tao' veggie lunch special . It tasted like sweet and sour and the veggies were drenched in sauce. My co worker ordered spicy orange chicken and it was not spicy her rice was also mushy. No napkins or hot mustard. Will not order again. And no fortune cookies. The zucchini had a sour taste to it! Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Yeah, the parking lot is super sketchy. Whomever owns the strip needs to put in some damn lights.  I stopped next door to do some laundry and checked this place out. I'm wondering about the bed?? I didn't see one. Anyways...There was a college boy taking orders and also doing the delivery, so if you walk in ring the bell.  I ordered sweet and sour chicken, crab and cheese wontons, and egg drop soup. I think it was great. The chicken was crispy and didn't look questionable like it does at some Chinese takeouts, you know what I mean. The sauce was on the side also.  The people who are complaining need to realize this isn't suppose to be a sit down restaurant. What are you expecting? This is Chinese take out! I basically got two meals for 13 bucks. I would eat here again. Probably today!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place at least four times and it's pretty great. The guy that's there when I go in is super nice and friendly. I've never ordered delivery so I can't speak on that however I've walked in and ordered majority of the time and the food is out and ready for me in a reasonable time frame. Chicken fried rice is phenomenal, wasn't super impressed with the egg drop soup."}
{"text":"VEGANS AND VEGETARIANS BEWARE!! Spring rolls are my absolute favorite so the first time I went to Mr. Hunans I inquired to make sure they were vegan, as in didn't contain eggs in the wrapper. They said they did not, so I ordered a few and fell in love with them; honestly they're delicios.  I went in another time, ordered more spring rolls and went on my way.  The third time I went in I ordered a bunch of spring rolls to go and to my horror, the person working informed me that not only do they contain eggs but also SHRIMP PASTE. I was super disgusted; not only do I not eat any meat or animal products, but I despise all sea food. Admittedly, I couldn't taste the shrimp but knowing it is in there I cannot eat them any more.  Being in the service industry I understand that sometimes miscommunications occur, so I did not get mad at the guy at the counter, as it was not his fault but the person who has misinformed me before. My dietary restrictions are mearly preference, however restaurants need to take such seriously for people who have allergies, especially to shellfish. I explained this to the counter person and his response was that even though he has tried to tell other employees this, \"it is a cultural thing and simply don't understand.\" That's no excuse at all; as a food establishment it is their responsibility to ensure food safety and preferences when required by certain guests.  Like I said, the food in my experience was tasty, however I was deceived into eating something I would never have by choice. If you don't have any dietary requirements or preferences I would say go ahead and try it, but just know they'll likely say anything to get you to by their food and you may have no idea whats in it."}
{"text":"I love this place especially because of the lemon chicken. My food always arrives hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Wow! Not Impressed very disgusting! Got my ordered delivered. It looked and tasted like crap. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I gave up on ordering Chinese food for the past few months because so many other restaurants were duds. I finally caved in and ordered delivery through Yelp (EatStreet) on March 1st.   Order: 6 Crab Cheese Fried Wontons $3.95 Hot and Sour Soup (small) $2.50 Orange Chicken $9.50 8 Pork Meat Fried Wontons $3.75 House Special Lo Mein (small) $6.25 Kung Pao Chicken (small) $5.95 $31.90  After tax, my delivery fee, and tip the total was $42.55 And no I didn't eat this all by myself! The delivery was prompt, the driver was nice, the food was fresh and was tasty, and the prices were decent. While this isn't the BEST tasting Chinese food I have had in the valley it the most decent one that delivers to me. So Mr. Hunan, you have a new fan.   I like it, I love it, I want some more of it"}
{"text":"I order takeout from this place all the time, and still do, so why am I giving it two stars? I struggled with that one. There are only three Chinese delivery places in North Tempe, and this is definitely the best of the three (faint praise, to be sure). It's standard Chinese hole-in-the-wall fare, which isn't a bad thing. I love dumplings, and I love hot-and-sour soup, and they do both pretty well. There prices are decent and they deliver quickly. I think I probably would have coughed up that third star if their physical location wasn't so awful. One example of many - there's a rickety screen in the back of the room where the cashier nurses her baby between taking orders. If hands are being washed between feedings, I didn't notice...."}
{"text":"Their phone service is aweful so rude the food is fair I keep trying it but the people who work here are the rudest of people I wonder if they train them to be assholes"}
{"text":"DO Not order from this restaurant!!!  I ordered online for a lunch delivery and after an hour and a half with no food and no one answering the phone, I drove to the restaurant to find a sign that said \"You blew it, We're closed\".  No mention of being closed when I was putting in my credit card info for the order!!!!"}
{"text":"I have not been pleased with chinese delivery in the valley but this place is AWESOME!  I got the chicken lo mein with rice and crab wontons.  Tastes fresh.  Delicious.  not stodgy or gross.  good flavor and consistency to the noodles.  I am very happy.  I will order from here again and again."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from them today and I never received my order! I was told it would be delivered with in 45-50 minutes. An hour passed by, no order, I called and they apologized for the delay but their driver was just leaving. Another hour passes by, I called again - the line was busy. I called back, they hung up the phone. I called again to explain the situation, was told they would look into it and they would call back. Needless to say, I never heard back from them."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have eaten here once before and thought it was good. We came back tonight and took our food to go. My fiance found a piece of steelwool in his food. My fiance called them to let them know. The owner didn't seem to care. We will not be coming back. We were not looking for a refund, we just wanted to let them know so they could correct the problem."}
{"text":"This was a very nice time. I enjoyed the service and the staff  Was amazing. I went late afternoon which was nice, cause it was quite and a quit warm environment. I'd recommend this place to all my friends. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I absolutely LOVE orange chicken but the chicken here is disgusting. It's either not cooked enough or drenched in really nasty sauce. And their Egg Fried Rice has absolutely no flavor what so ever. Really disappointing. I also had their wontons, not bad but also not good. Overall I was very disappointed with my meal."}
{"text":"So I've had delivery several times plus I've had pick up..... The food is on point every time and the delivery is fast!  This does have a great NY style influences tot he Chinese food (if your not from NY you have no idea). I wish I lived closer to have the best NY Chinese grub all the time...."}
{"text":"Mr. Hunan why did you have to fail me? Were to begin. The office I work in has been ordering delivery from Mr. Hunan for years, but the last couple of times we have ordered it has taken forever, not just longer than normal, more like one & a half hours for delivery. I'm sorry if I order lunch at 11:00, I'm not expecting to eat it 12:30 and if it's going to take that long please don't tell me it will be there in a half hour, and to make matters worse we try to call and there isn't any answer...at all...for like 30 minutes calling every 10 seconds..... Anyway, we order 4 lunch specials for delivery on a Thursday afternoon for a co-workers birthday. I ordered the Chicken Lo Mein, big mistake. The chicken was cut in paper thin pieces, but that wasn't the problem. The problem was the chicken and noodles had absolutely no flavor. It tasted like boiled noodles and chicken..meh. The rice was fresh but again not a whole lot of flavor! The birthday girls Sesame Chicken was all breading and the egg roll looked like it had been re-fried. Another co-worker had the bourbon chicken, she said her's was just \"ok\" and the fourth had Cashew Chicken, again just \"ok\". Mr. Hunan was always our go to place for chinese but after being let down on food and service we probably are going to scratch it from our list."}
{"text":"disgusting chinese food. panda express is way better. and they mess up orders really easily. we called to notify that they messed up on their order and they didnt seem to care or make it better. bad service and nasty food."}
{"text":"Never order! On 5/10/13, my coworkers and I ordered Mr. Hunan's in tempe at 10:30am. At 12pm they brought 2/3 orders. I called and the guy said it would be another hour and then hung up on me! I called back at 12:50 and asked for a manager and he immediately hung up! I never got my food! (i am also diabetic and got sick waiting so long to eat) Don't ever eat there! Ugh!   Update as of 5/24/13: Learned today that Mr. Hunan's is on the Dirty Diner's list for 7 violations! Look it up! They are horrible! Worst customer service ever and they're nasty!"}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST Shrimp Fried Rice....hands down!!!! I absolutely love their food here. It is so good & definitely worth the wait. You can always choose to order ahead if you dont want to wait or even order delivery!! Very delicious & well worth it. Plus their prices are super fair!! You are definitely getting the best meal for your dollar. I recommend this place to everyone."}
