{"text":"We had a family gathering of around 25 members on Thanksgiving day at the Royal Fine Dining Restaurant on Silver Star Blvd (near Kennedy & Steeles).  It is quite pricey and the service was terrible. We had to ask for chilli sauce and refill of tea multiple times before we got any. Food was okay (nothing great). We paid the bill of $620 but later discovered that they charged us $73.50 for 49 teas when we had only 25 pax (2 teas per person @ $1.50 per portion). One table had 6 children where none had tea. All restaurants charge one tea per person not 2 teas! I don't think I would ever go back to that restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place is a 3.5-4 star depending on when you visit.  We visited at 11:20 a.m. (after their morning special has finished) and were seated at about 11:40 a.m. the morning special is a better deal as SML were the same price ($3) whereas afterwards it's as follows: S-$3, M-$4, L-$5 which is quite typical of most dim sum restaurants anyway. Some of the dim sum:  Har gow- filled with shrimp and covered in a thin layer of dumpling  Siu Mai: meaty and filled with pork with roe on top  Eel and shrimp dumpling: a pleasant surprise  Pork blood and intestines: this felt like a rip off as there was not a single piece of intestine, only pork blood  Custard bun: a lot of custard but not a lot of a soft bun to complement it  Milk and egg custard with pastry top: not a flaky pastry top at all  When we asked for the bill, the grouchy lady kept clearing our table and shouting across the place to ask for the credit card machine. Then one of her colleagues came over and he pretty much tossed the machine into our hands, then took it back, thanked us in a very curt manner (very authentic?) and stormed off.  Not that it relates directly to this restaurant but the newly arrives party that sat behind us reminded me of loud, obnoxious burning ash trays who have no consideration for others as they pushed their chairs out as far as possible and shouted across a 4 seater table despite the noise level dying down already. Therefore, my personal dining experience has been affected and a good heads up to others."}
{"text":"Went here with the family for breakfast, the place was packed but got seated pretty quickly. I liked this place because they had a bunch of dishes that were different than the typical dim sum restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for Dim Sum for the first time with 3 other families (each with at least 2 kids) and the service here was amazing.  The food came out quickly.  They had highchairs and change tables. The first time I've seen such a family friendly Chinese restaurant.  The food was good, albeit expensive.  Would definitely go back again though when I want to indulge on some good dim sum."}
{"text":"1/7 dishes we ordered was considered satisfying. I would not recommend this place even if they have good prices, the food was not worth it at all."}
{"text":"The place looks nice, very busy during weekend lunch hours.  The food was decent.  Service was remarkable.  One of the floor managers there (goes by the name of Ricky, I remembered it from his name tag) was very attending and pleasant.  My family and I was impressed with his service.  Normally Chinese restaurants does not have much of a service during their busy hours (its a common thing among Chinese restaurants) due to its massive traffic (around a dozen of staff vs a couple hundred of customers), but Ricky gave us a good experience.  Will definitely go back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Sunday night and there were several private parties and a wedding banquet going on. Great place for large groups. Portions are huge, great presentation and service. Lobster was huge and tasty. Are other dishes didn't disappoint...had fish, tofu, peking duck. Dessert came with the red bean and got mango pudding and almond cookies."}
{"text":"Tip: If you plan to dine here on weekends, I suggest someone in your party arrive by 9:30am and claim a table.  The place fills up pretty fast despite the number of tables available.  From 9am-11am, seven days a week, dim sum prices are $3.20 for S,M,L.  Taste is slightly better than average.  Kudos to updating some of the dishes beyond the usual and traditional."}
{"text":"Visit Day :Monday Victoria day holiday ( May 22, 2017) . Time \": 9AM no line up or waiting. Type : dim Sum Dim Sum Price : regular price  ( L) $5 ( the half price doesn't apply to Holidays) Ambience : nice, big  and elegant decoration with gigantic TV screen Quality : Good Washrooms : clean and smell ok Parking :   lots of space Service  Good and prompt  my pick : Chicken feet and Mango Milk Pudding. Extra : Tea $1.50  (ask for free hot water pot when the Tea gets cold). Extra : mustard /Hot sauce combo  is free but you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Favourite dim sum place - although it can get very busy and lines are long in the mornings, the food is worth it. There is very little or no msg at all (I am sensitive to it) and it is delicious and fresh, doesn't taste like pre-made frozen dim sum.  It is expensive throughout the day so I recommend waking up early and going for early bird dim sum.  Dinner is also really good and quite expensive but worth a try.  The place itself is fancy, beautiful and spacious.  Service is usually good."}
{"text":"Dim sum is such a rare choice for me - I don't like waiting in super long lineups, I can't stand super-noisy see-lai shouting nonstop, and I don't believe in waking up at ungodly hours.  Hrrumph. Yes, I am dim-sum-prissy! Royale manages to avoid these pitfalls.  There was no wait at 12:30pm for a table of 5 on a Saturday, with still a few tables left empty.  Noise factor was at a regular level, and you're actually able to hear over the table without having to yell.  Coming here past the early morning special means the prices are considerably steeper (starting at $2.80, going upwards to $6.80 for the more expensive dishes).   The important stuff: the food. Though I pretty much liked everything, it was the pyramid-shaped, durian puffs filled with warm, creamy durian and encased by a (fried?) flaky pastry dough that were the standout for me.   The not-so-great: the service, which was nearly nonexistent - save for the ladies who come around with food and check things off the list.  Our tea was never refilled until we waved people down like we were hailing taxis.  Attempts at upsells were major.  Oh, we got something we didn't order?  (The crystal purses filled with shrimp, shaped like stingrays) \"Try it anyway, OK? We already made it, just try it once.\" Mind you, he didn't say \"try for free\" - he made us pay for it in the end, even when we insisted we didn't order it and didn't want it.  The same person, also tried to sell a king crab congee special of the day to us, and wouldn't stop trying to push it onto us even when we already said no multiple times.   Based on the food alone, I'd give Royale 4 stars.  Coupled with the service though in looking at our overall restaurant experience though, it rings in at a 3 stars for me.  And now, back to sleep...zzz...."}
{"text":"My Dim Sum standards are probably lower now that i've moved away from Toronto.   However, I think that Royale does a pretty solid job at it.   It's conveniently located and its parking lot is relatively easier to navigate than other popular Dim Sum restaurants.   It's spacious with high ceilings and numerous tables.   I also found the staff to be pretty attentive and the overall environment a little less frantic than average.  The true reason for the 4-star rating is their char siu bolo bau (pineapple pork buns). They were great and I would return just to reorder them again."}
{"text":"Family favourite. This place changes dim sum option every so often. It is different and fusional sometimes"}
{"text":"I am scratching my head on this one.  My dim sum experience here is quite different than other reviewers.  I find the dim sum dishes too sweet and heavy on MSG.   Presentation is also a bit too sloppy.  It seems to be a very popular place.  People line up for the restaurant to open in the morning.  I am clearly a minority here but I stand by my verdict.  There are many better dim sum places in the area."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to go for dim sum. Whether it be before after 11am. Before 11am, small medium and large dishes are $2.80. I would used to willingly pay full price for my favorite dishes there. This included the dim sum lamb and duck dishes. Both steamed. There were a few other dishes I used to love but let's not dwell on that since my review isn't about what I used to love anymore.  Yes, the dishes are still all the same.. But the quality now is horrendous.. Its like the same name but totally different dishes. The dim sum chefs seem to have changed as even the presentation seems different. Thoroughly disappointed. Refer to my lamb dim sum dish picture and you will see what I mean.. I really need to go search through my old photos for a before and after.. But basically the dish used to have at least six different ingredients with chunky pieces of lamb. Lamb was thorough marinated with great seasoning.. Now I am left with pieces of dry lamb on bones. This is true with their other dishes.. Their previously famous steamed chicken feet is now dry and flavourless.. We ordered a vegetable in fish soup and the vegetable.. You could taste was at least three days too old as it was not crisp and instead.. chewy. The fish broth was the most salty soup ever.   Very disappointed with the new change in kitchen staff.. Will probably not be going back. Time to find a new dim sum place for me and my guests."}
{"text":"I realllly wanted to like this place based on the reviews that I've read, but unfortunately the quality of food I received along and the price tag was too disproportionate for me to give this place an A-OK rating. Price wise I would say they are trying to get at the level of Skyview, Dragonboat and Spring Villa which is obviously higher end. They also had a lot of over the top dishes like Shark Fin Siu Mai to \"justify\" this slightly higher pricing. However the aforementioned Siu Mai was dry and tasteless with 2 slivers of shark fin. I personally am anti-shark fin so that's fine BUT I do get the feeling that a normally s/m dish is now being charged as an L dish for two slivers of shark fin.   Second example of disappointment was the big bun (Dai Bao). It had obvious signs of being re-steamed (the dough was mushy at certain parts) and was definitely not fresh and nor did it taste like it was. We didn't come here too late in the day so the re-steaming can't easily be justified.  Final disappointment was the durian puff pastry that I was reaaaallly looking forward to since I'm a huge durian fan. The pastry was neither buttery nor flaky. In fact it was powdery and tasted like flour. The durian filling also tasted like it was mixed with a disproportionate amount of flour which is especially disappointing when it is being sold as an L dim sum meaning that it's one of the more $$ dishes. That's some pricey flour I got there.   (Note the 3 examples were not the ONLY disappointments but the most memorable ones)   The only reason to justify a return to this is for the early bird special. Since there are more L, XL, and SP dishes than there are S/M dishes it will turn out to be more worthwhile during early bird b/c the feeling of being ripped off will be lessened. Otherwise I will not recommend this place aside from good decor and mediocre service. There are better high end dim sum places out there with food that actually warrants the price tag. They do have an interesting menu, I only wish that they were able to execute properly."}
{"text":"Previously this place was the Starwalk Buffet, and let me tell you, it's completely changed into a totally different restaurant.  It is no longer a buffet at all, it now is a classy looking fine dining Chinese restaurant.  They have a morning dim sum service, host weddings, host large community events such as galas and also have regular dinner service as well.    The place looks great inside and a lot of time and money has been spent on the decor.  The pillars, ceiling and back walls are all covered with Chinese architecture and designs.  Even the table cloths and chairs look very high end and a good amount of time is spent setting up the tables here.  Service is a little bit better than most restaurants around this area, but to be honest you can't expect much.  I usually go here with regulars so the service I get is pretty good from dim sum to dinner.    I've also been here for dinner and a gala event.  Both times the dinner menu mirrored what we had for the gala and the food was great.  It tasted clean and well made and you didn't get that typical MSG taste as you usually do with Chinese places.  I had everything from crispy chicken, bbq pork, lobster, steamed fish and a few dessert cookies and jello.  I also had the red bean dessert soup, which was better than most other places I've tried.  The food is very fresh and made with care.  Even the presentation is better than what you usually get with most restaurants serving this style of food.  There are lots of little garnishes and vegetable carvings to accompany your dish.  Overall I really like what they did with this place.  The atmosphere is nice, the place is very large and you can't help but notice the lush beautiful looking interior.  I would definitely come here again for dim sum, dinner and other events that occur in the area!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure if you close at 11, why do you send your chefs home before 9:30?? Very disappointing when we walk in and are turned away at 9:25. #letdown #pulltheopensign"}
{"text":"From time to time they like to switch up the dim sum menu to add some new dim sum dishes. I tried the abalone puff pastry which was recently added and contained pieces of diced pork, mushrooms and a slice of abalone on top with a sprinkle of bonito flakes. I like that the fried foods here are not super oily and the dishes don't take long to come out after you order. I will definitely come back again for more dim sum!"}
{"text":"Last night I was here with my family for my elderly relative's birthday dinner that was held inside a private room. We ordered their prix-fixe menu that came with lobster, fish, fried shrimp balls, fried rice, e-fu noodles, scallops & squids and shark fin soup to share. Food tasted okay and all 11 of us got enough portion to share. Until my husband found a dead fly that was cooked in the food that we were having. And sucks for him, he was the unlucky one who got served a dead fly while the rest of us cleared our plate unknowingly. We told our hostess about it, she immediately apologized and took the dish away. 10 mins later, the manager came to check up on us to see if everything was okay, so we told him it was all good until we found a dead fly on our plate. Surprisingly for us, his first reaction was to crack a lame joke on my husband for being a sweetheart so sweet that the fly was attracted to him. What kind of idiot would think it's okay to make fun of someone who almost ate a fly?  Obviously, we weren't impressed by his sense of humour, we felt grossed out. And his unseemly laughs certainly didn't make us feel any better. Not to mention that he didn't even acknowledged the fact that this shouldn't even happen in the first place but he also tried to rub it off with his laughs as if nothing had happened.   We were so put off by his attitude towards the situation that we became speechless. And that was when he finally decided to apologize for this. Yet, he put no effort to compensate the customer or to ensure that it won't happen again. And this came from the person who was supposed to manage the restaurant? No Thanks.   1 star for the rest of the food without the fly 1 star for the hostess who lighted up the celebration"}
{"text":"Though I'm far from me being a dim sum expert, I feel this place was fairly good, though I have had better. I've never found that Dim Sum intends to have big, bold  flavours - rather there seems to be emphasis on texture, and on the few components of each dish. With that said, I felt some of the dishes could've had more flavour - even within the approach to dim sum.  But it's a pretty nice spot and none of the dishes fell very short either, and many met expectation. The staff were friendly and food came out quickly and very fresh. I was with a group of at least 12 and ordered about 3 times as many dishes, so I can't break down the meal.  Enjoyable meal that hit the spot and for a good price."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.  The fish we ordered was not fresh. A lot of the dim sum tasted like it was recooked.   When we brought this up to their staff and manager,  they didn't do anything about it.  Service was not great and simply said it's supposed to taste like that.   Price is also on the higher end. For this price range,  i think casa Victoria is a better option."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Came here for dinner and ended up in the bathroom for 2 hours after.  If you have a sensitive stomach, don't come here ?"}
{"text":"If you want good dim sum, you definitely have to come up to scarborough/ markham for it. My fam and I have been to this establishment a couple of times now and each time we go it is super busy (especially for the early bird dimsum at 2.90 a dish for S M or L). Since we went on father's day the wait for a table was expected. The resturant opens at 9 am and when we got there at 9 15 there was already a wait list of 10 people... venue is super big in size and can easily fit 100 tables but lots of people come for the early bird special. We waited 1 hour until we got our table.  Dim sum here is not from cart but you mark on a paper and they bring over to your table. The variety of the dim sum is good. We ordered an immense amount of dim sum including har gow, siu Mai, the rice noodles (shrimp and beef and the fried dough version). Tripe, chicken feet and a bunch of desserts and deep fried items. I have to say the steam items were super hot and big with filling. This resto definitely does not cheap out on their ingredients.  The har gow is stuffed with lots of shrimp and the skin of the dumpling was thin and delicious. The deep fried items were also super crispy ( like the shrimp pork chive deep fried dumpling and the deep fried seaweed crab mest)  Rice pots are 4.50 for dimsum and not covered under the 2.90 special. We also ordered an XL item which was the squid tentacle cause my dad likes to there. Comes in big portion and was very tasty.  For dessert we ordered the durian puff pastry. I am not a fan of durian but the taste of this was very very good. If you can stand the smell prior then you will have a silky milky taste of sweetness once it's in your mouth! My sister also ordered the mango pudding and some sago dessert. It was refreshing but I don't think I would order it again.   Overall service was fast and lots of server here to help. But it is a bonus if you speak chinese to them to get better and faster service!"}
{"text":"Wait, you mean I'm going all the way to Steeles and Kennedy and we're not going to Fishman Lobster Clubhouse?  My wife for some reason is become quite the Sunday morning dim sum fan all of a sudden.    This was however an organized get together with dare I say our ultra elite gang of super friends.  This is just your casual organized friend get together.  We do that and sometimes if it's not a picnic in the park, towers of lobster, baskets of fried chicken or just a trivia get together, having a large group dim sum is just another reason to enjoy each others company.  Good get togethers usually involve a lazy susan because it means there's going to be a lot of food and it's a group thing because the table is big.  The thing is these places on Sundays don't take reservations just like how brunch places don't take reservations in the morning either.  It's first come first serve and if you want a big table for 10 etc you best get there early.  Getting dim sum before 11am is a thing now because it's not only the in time to get it but it's also typically specially priced.  That's all you had to say.  While there are so many dim sum places in Scarborough and Markham are they really all that different?  This place to me was just OK.  Because I've been having it more and more these days there's a few places I've been to just recently that I thought were a bit better.  The pork steamed dumplings here are absolutely huge and borderline ridiculous.  I mean it's like trying to pick up what equates to almost a pool ball with chopsticks and trying to get your around it.  Their pineapple buns are good but again, I've had flakier and tastier ones.  The other dumplings, were fine and the squid while tasty seemed a bit dry.  The pork bone seemed too fatty and some pieces looked a bit too red.  The service seemed good considering how busy the place was.  Overall I've had better.  The decor of this place is fancy like other large banquet halls but personally I'll take better food over ambiance every day of the week."}
{"text":"Royale Fine Dining Banquet is your typical dim sum restaurant. It has the usual cheesy Chinese dim sum decor. It is not a fancy bougie place like some other dim sum locations, but that is what I like about it. And no, it is not a dirty dump either. It is nice enough that many people probably hold their Chinese-style wedding receptions here. It was crowded during lunch time but we had no wait getting a table for four. The food is good, but standard - it lacked any form of innovation. It is still better than most dim sum restaurants in New York that's for sure. I thought the egg tarts here are particularly delicious.  Traditional. Classic. But that is not a bad thing."}
{"text":"It was a random dinner as my colleague invited me to a fine dining chinese restaurant located across Pacific Mall. I am a huge fan of Chinese food and been to many restaurants across the GTA but this place was simply amazing right when I walked into the door. The ambience was welcoming and beautiful with high ceilings and glass chandeliers. The service was impecabble which is very rare to find in an asian restaurant as they were dressed in professional restaurant attire and were friendly and courteous. The twelve course meal was by far the best I have had even in comparison to the fancy chinese banquet/wedding meals that I've had. This is a restaurant definitely worth checking out if you have a little to splurge for an upscale Chinese meal."}
{"text":"We came here for dim sum today. I have been here 4 times, since it opened and each time I would rate the food as a 3 star and service as a 2 star but today was the worst.  My brother is visiting me, from the UK, so I decided to bring him here for dim sum. Food was taking at least 30 minutes to arrive, some dishes took 45 minutes. When food did come, it was just ok. Most dishes were nothing to rave about and most were bland.  Service for replenishing tea/hot water was really slow. We had problems flagging a server down and twice the hostess helped us because we were seated near her, at the door. I am giving a bad review today because of what happened when we paid the bill.  It took us 10 minutes to get someone to calculate our bill. Then another 10 minutes to get our bill. The total was $43.60 and my brother paid with a $50 bill. I joked and said that he wouldn't get any change. Well we waited for 10 minutes and he didn't get any change. So he got mad and went up to the cashier. He asked about his change, the black suit had poured it into the tip box without bringing it back to our table. We saw him do it because the place is not particularly busy. The cashier just opened the tip box and gave it back to my brother. My brother brought it back to our table and we still left a $4.40 tip. Which is still 10%, after tax. I was so embarrassed to have taken my brother there today. I thought that I would take him to a nicer decorated place, instead of our usual dives, but to just assume all the change is a tip is ridiculous.  All restaurants should take the change back, unless told - no change.  I' m never going back here again. Rubbish food, slow service and too many black suits chatting and doing nothing at the cashier stand.  Place is not that busy anymore, and I can see many reasons why."}
{"text":"Five star dim sum in Toronto are far and few. This place is darn close.   Worth the drive and the wait in line."}
{"text":"I'm here for New Year Dinner party and didn't expect great food since its a party. But the food game and it was very good. The service is pretty good with manner. The decoration is very nice. I won't mind come here for lunch and try it out."}
{"text":"Life lessons from Royale Fine Dining:   1. The virtue of patience. Their dinner service will be extremely slow and force you to bond with your family and enjoy their company as you wait over 2.5 hours for all your orders to come out.  2. The importance of being good at what you do. Despite initial rage over long wait time, our anger subsided and hearts melted when we bit into the food. They do seafood well, lobster x 3 ways with cellophane noodle option is a must.   3. People will eat anything if you tell them it will make them more beautiful. Like a bird's nest made from the saliva of a bird. Complimentary at Royale until June 30th."}
{"text":"Love the open space and high ceilings here. Waiting time isn't too long and they hire enough workers so that your hand isn't in the air waving for couple minutes until someone notices you. Always a pleasure to return here compared to other dim sum places. I would rate food a 3 star + 1 for presentation."}
{"text":"Taking the place of the old Starwalk Buffet, Royale Fine Dining Banquet has it's own isolated building and is extremely spacious to enjoy morning tea. Walking in, it has the classic Victorian design such as chandeliers, nicer plates, teapots and cups, that appear to be popular in most Chinese Restaurants nowadays to upgrade the class of the restaurant and boost up the prices of the dimsum. I like to go from 9am-11am when they have their early bird specials on dim sum. Also, it's much less crowded and you wont' have to wait for seats during this time!  I think a lot of their dishes are very creative such as the Durian puff pastry, the cream in mochi and a green tea paste inside a flour that's lightly fried. Although I'm just listing all of the desserts, I thought that the shrimp dumpling, crab meat dumpling, and spare ribs were very tasty as well as the shrimps were filled with large shrimps that weren't soggy, crab meat was designed with two dots on it that looked like eyes and they crab meat inside, though I don't think it's real crab meat, had texture to it. Lastly, the spare ribs were cooked very well, I didn't see a lot of fat on them when I ate it, which is an extra bonus."}
{"text":"Came for dim sum with a friend to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant was big and well designed. Ordered quite a lot of stuff, 9 dishes in total for 2 people. Ironically, the first thing that came was the dessert. It was Taro Sticky Rice Ball. After 5 mins, main dishes starts coming, beef balls, shrimp dumpling, siu mai, tripe, chicken feet, etc. Overall the food was pretty good with the exception of the BBQ pork steam bun, as it seems to be from frozen package instead of handmade. They gave us a voucher for a soup dinner."}
{"text":"We came for lunch one Sunday after church. Between the three of us, we got 5 things: some kind of lotus leaf wrapped glutinous rice with chicken filling, a pork rib steamed rice, eel in steamed rice noodle roll, steamed milk pudding covered with puff pastry, and glutinous rice roll with cream and sweet purple potato filling.  The desserts were pretty good, especially the glutinous rice roll, but the savory foods were pretty standard. Service was, for the most part, standard to most Chinese restaurants. Our steamed rice and our steamed rice noodle roll came with bottles of soy sauce. These two dishes came at different times, so we already had one bottle of soy sauce. Our waitress had a second one for our second dish. Instead of giving the bottle to us, she just poured it into our existing bottle. It was very odd and very unexpected. It was also not particularly pleasant.  Our total after tax and 10% tip was about $39. Not the greatest, but certainly not the worst either."}
{"text":"Dim sum with the parents always starts early to take advantage of the morning specials. Overall, it's a good dim sum place but there were 2 problems.  First, I arrived early to get a table but found that I was waiting longer then usual. My mom got into a heated argument with the hostess which got pretty loud. She accused the hostess of letting regulars in without getting a number. I would have preferred the hostess keep it on the down low even if it was true or not. She made a scene by being loud and defensive when she could have easily diffused the situation.  The next problem was being recommended to order scallop congee by the wait staff which was a special item not on the menu.  We gladly ordered the congee cuz I love scallop. When it arrived, it was a big bowl but the taste and amount of scallop was disappointing.   I will likely come back but hope they can improve in these areas of being more classy and recommend good dishes instead of an upsell of disappointment."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and they have many classic dishes that can be found at any dim sum places but their incorporate their own twist into them. Since it is a banquet, the restaurant is very large which is excellent for big events or weddings. The banquet would be classified as a high-end dim sum restaurant from the decorations and table set up which means dim sum can be quite expensive for each dish.   Each dish was around $3-4 depending on the size of the dish which can be found on the menu and ranged from M-XL. The menu ranged from steamed dishes, pastries, fried, or chef recommendations. A rule of thumb that many people say is to order 3 dishes per person to there won't be leftovers (hopefully). I recommend ordering some of the chef's creations such as green tea crepe with assorted nuts. It was not too sweet and the nuts were crushed to very fine pieces and these two ingredients complemented each other really well."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum saturday morning for their early bird and I am pretty happy they changed some of their dim sum items.   The last time I came here, they increased their prices and decreased their options so I stopped coming. They open at 8:30 am now, and free newspaper monday to friday. Dim sum is $3.20 for s/m/l and tea price is $1.20/person before 10.55 am monday-sunday.   Today we ordered five dishes. Shrimp dumpling came in four pieces. The skin was a little too thick for me but the shrimp was big and fresh.  The baked creamy custard bun which came in three. It came out warm, and the bun was so soft. The custard wasnt overly sweet. The papaya egg tart which also came in threes. The skin was nice and crispy and egg wasnt overly sweet. Also came out warm. The seafood/pork congee which was super dense. The congee was average nothing special. Last but not least I got the preserved vegetable steamed with black pepper pig stomach which was steamed just right. The dim sum was all in all not bad. They did add a lot of new dim sum choices so I will definitely be coming back and trying it out. I know servicr can be a hit or miss here but today it was a hit."}
{"text":"Overall, I would say that the food is pretty good... Good enough for me to keep coming back with my parents. The 'managerial' staff are good and definitely provides high quality service. However, some of the other staff will take the 'blind/look through approach' and no matter how hard you try, you wouldn't be able to get their attention.   Dim sum is good and the quality of the food is good. I like the fact that they often make little changes to their menu so I wouldn't feel bored with their food.   I love the durian pastry!!! The stir fry vermicelli is also very delicious and I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"An upscale dimsum restaurant. This place has unique dimsum dishes (in addition to the classics) such as durian pastries. One of the dishes wrapped with rice noodles came out extremely hard, but the manager graciously replaced our order with another dish. The two standout dismsum dishes were the fried zhong and the beef tendons. The thousand layer coconut cake was disappointing."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for dim sum. They offer all the standard dim sum dishes and I thought most of the dishes were good.   Notes on some of the food:  - The steamed rice noodle rolls with shrimp were good but each roll only had 2 pieces of shrimp in them.  - The steamed rice noodle roll with minced pork and parsley was surprisingly good. It was my favorite dish out of everything we ordered. Way better than the shrimp roll and that's usually my favorite item at dim sum. - They have 2 types of bbq pork buns here. A steamed version and a baked one. They both seem to use the same filling but the baked version has a pineapple bun top.  - The shrimp dumplings didn't look too appetizing but were still good. They had lots of shrimp inside and the skin wasn't too thick or anything - We got a pot of rice but the rice was way overcooked. Not sure if this is a one time thing or not. - Nothing to note on the other dishes.   Overall it's an okay place for dim sum but I'm in no rush to come back here again. I think I would rather try a new place instead of dining here again."}
{"text":"what used to be Starwalk Buffet, this place has transformed into a refined a-la carte fine dining chinese restaurant.  The restaurant decor is quite GOTTI, in other words, lots of gold color fixtures, statutes, beautiful chandeliers, one huge screen in the backdrop.    For the best bang-for-buck dim-sum I would recommend this place in a heart beat.  From open till 11am daily its $2.80 per dim sum dish or any size, so it makes sense to order a large.   The food is up to my standards, and so are their portions.  Their staff are friendly, and efficient.  Overall Royale looks good to me and it always seems to draw a crowd.  If you're looking for fix menus for special occasions, and dining rooms for big parties it's avialable.  However the prices for their fix menus can run up to a couple of hundred $$."}
{"text":"Located in Scarborough - this is a happening dim sum place!  As usual - before 11am it is reduced pricing, but come early b/c there is always a line up.  This place is HUGE.  tables after tables - they even have a stage and put some tables on it.    We ordered a bunch of dishes - dumplings and more dumplings, squid, a bunch of shrimp dishes, an onion pancake with ham on top, (I'm not even going to try and remember all the names); mango pudding for desert (delicious).  Everything was good - not great, but good - especially for the price for all the food we had.  Service is quick which is great b/c there are so many patrons here dining.  and when you are hungry - you are hungry.   The parking lot is decent although if it gets closer to 10:30am you might have to park in adjacent lots.  Can't go wrong for less than $20 for a filling brunch :)"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight. Had the six person set dinner. Fish plate tasted strange, rather than just plain steamed fish, they decided to do a salted fish which wasted the fish. The lobster was small compared to the plate. The worst part is there was a wedding and all the waiters and waitresses tended to the wedding and we waited a long time for everything. Half an hour for dessert. We saw a table that was so fed up one if their guest walked up and leave. Interesting dishes here, but service really make the dining experience worst than if the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I've been to royale a couple of times. The most recent time was this weekend, Feb 14th. Dim sum between 9am to 11am on weekends is $2.90 per dish. After 11am, it's back to the regular price.   Service isn't the best. The wait staff are pretty pushy. You have to be firm with them when they try to push dishes on you.  Food isn't bad. There's a twist to some dishes. For example, they added bean curd to the beef rice rolls. This was okay, but I preferred the traditional version.   They had a lion dance for Chinese New Years, which was a pleasant surprise.   This place is fancier than other places around the area. If you are looking for something more fancy and don't want to drive all the way to hwy 7 then this is your place. However, I would still opt to go to full house. Food is better, price is the same, but not as fancy.   Btw: you will most likely have to wait so go earlier to make sure you get the deal."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday morning dim sum with family. It was a jam packed restaurant. A lot of people waiting to be seated before 11AM. The price for dim sum is $2.80 for S M L which is good value. The food is either on par or better than most places in Toronto. It was very tasty without too much MSG - which I appreciate. This place beats Casa de Luz at woodside in both food and service."}
{"text":"We went there last sunday at 10am and got table just in time(10.40) to get the special deal(10.49 order time) we already pick our menu before seated and 3menu was come quick but it took them another 35min until our last order come out. It is sucks when We already finish mincemeat rice and the fried smelt fish arrive(last one). The service was good but the wait wasn't fun. I have to check the waitlist several time coz the front lady doesn't/can't speak english in number. The food was all good but if only the fish was coming earlier i will gave 5*"}
{"text":"Grand decor! They have a huge TV that keeps running a Hong Kong tv food show, and it is so huge that you can see it from the furthest corner.  They have lots of special dim sums; steamed rice in bamboo tube, bitter melon marinated in preserved dried berry juice, steamed crab meat dumplings, baked durian puff pastry and sweet tapioca and durian covered with puff pastry (just to name a few).  Cousins are durian fans and I could tell how good that durian puff pastry was just by the look on their faces. (It really smells!! Yuck for me!! )  Come here durian fanssssssssss Highly recommended Thousand layers coconut cake.  Not many restaurants make this dessert and this is real gooooood!    Attentive service.  Our teapots were kept filling up with hot tea.  Price on high side but well worth it : ) ** They take reservations and so do call ahead ** *** dim sum - S $2.80, M $3.80, L $4.80, XL $5.80, SP $6.80, J $7.80  *** **** dim sum starts at 9am till 3pm ****"}
{"text":"Pay before 11am but get there early when it opens or good luck getting a seat   Food quality was average  Service quality was average Cleanness was average"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday. It was around noon and the place was hardly half full, a lot less people than I was expecting.   The manager came by and recommended us pork congee and lobster noodles, which we ended up getting. Both were poor choices. He also gave us 10% off, which was nice.   The dim sum dishes were either average or below average. There were a lot of employees just walking around, yet we got virtually no service.   I highly doubt I'll come here again as there are so many dim sum places to choose from."}
{"text":"Got her around 10:20am for the early bird dim sum special at $2.80 a dish. Had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated but its to be expected on a Saturday morning.   Service was a little on the slow side at the beginning. It took about 20 minutes to finally see the food arrive at our table but once the first dish came out they all started to come out little by little. The place is huge so I was already expecting it to be a bit slow for service. There was a super huge TV screen in the back of the restaurant. Must have been at least 20 feet long and it wasn't no cheap projected image either. I wish I had that in my home.   All the food was pretty good. My only complaint is that I wish they had more variety of dishes, especially the steam buns category.   3.5 stars  I still like Fancy Chinese Cuisine for dim sum over this place"}
{"text":"Dinner on a Friday night for early mothers dat celebration. Reservations made for 7. When we arrived the whole place was 10% full no reservations needed. It was so quiet on a Friday evening it was weird.  Our party of 7 ordered a package for 6 ppl. Even though package was for 6 ppl it was enough to feed 8. There was so much food left over. Package price was $148 excluding tax and tips. So after tax tips it was $185. Roughly $30 per person.   Over all meal was okay. I enjoyed the soup at the beginning. The food came in large portions. However the quality and taste was mediocre. One of the fish dishes we had was steamed but it had so much fish scales still on the fish we left it 70% in eaten...for that price we were expecting at least a whole chicken... but it was only half.   We had a VIP card that suppose to have 10% off but when we told them they said VIP cards won't work with the package meals. It wasn't stated on the card only that it has to be paid by cash and won't work on dim sum before 11.   I'll maybe only go for dim sum but dinner will reconsider."}
{"text":"Dim sum here was pretty good today!  It was 3pm when i went and theh were in the middle of flipping the room to dinner and we only had a few dishes but they kept their service processional.   Greeted us with when we got there so late in the day to ask for dim sum service.  Flipped the room around us and didnt rush us out.  Great place for food.  Im happy to be booking my wedding here :)"}
{"text":"(2.5*/5)   Extremely average dimsum - average quality, average taste.  We ordered the usual dimsum spread - har gow, siu mai, rice rolls, buns, etc. Nothing was really outstanding. The har gow wrapper and cheung fun were way too thick. The siu mai is huge though... like ginormous. We also ordered their specialty plates (?? or whatever was in a red font LOL) - seafood dumpling in soup, cuttlefish balls and seaweed-wrapped crab shrimp roll thing. Don't. Especially that seaweed roll... it was pretty gross especially when they serve it to be dipped in vinegar.   This place gets quite busy before 10:55AM since that's when their early bird special is over. Arrive early and put your order in before 10:55 if you want $3.50 for all S,M,L dimsums! Issa good deal. Service here is also good, but verrryyyy slow. We had to cancel a couple plates because they hadn't come for over an hour.   Def won't be back again, there really wasn't anything worth going back for."}
{"text":"1 - This is one of my go-to place for dim sum (you choose from the list of items offered for dim sum and the staff bring it out to your table; not the usual dim sum in carts); the Managers / Staffs here are great and very attentive! The décor is upscale and classy!  2 - Also came here to have a traditional Chinese sit down dinner and the food was great! Portion size of the dishes are good (not too little!).   Will definitely be coming back here for dim sum / dinner!"}
{"text":"great place for dim sum! they haveMalaysian Steamed Cake here! but dont think its home made"}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly service  Cons: Food takes long to come out  Came here for a 10 course banquet for my niece's 100 day celebration.  The food and service overall is good.  It just took a while for everything to come out.    Royale has 2 private rooms for any function you want to hold.  The rooms can hold about 6 tables so you can have about 50-60 people and still be very comfortably.  The wall separating the two rooms aren't very sound proof though.  The other room was playing music and it was drowning out some conversation in our room sometimes.  Our dinner time was set for 5pm.  It was a standard 10 course Chinese banquet meal.  Even with some people being late, we were all seating by about 530ish.  The food however was delayed for whatever reason.  We didn't begin eating until about 645.  halfway through the 10 courses, there was another 25 minute delay with the food.  Even the waitstaff, who were very good were just standing around wondering what was going on.    All in all, a dinner which was supposed to start at 5pm didn't finish serving food till about 930.  When you have young children, asking them to sit for 4 hours for a meal is a tough ordeal for everyone involved.  The food and service here were pretty good though.  The staff were pretty nice throughout the meal.  Everything served looked and tasted pretty good.  Nothing amazing, but nothing you could find to complain about.  If it wasn't for the delays, I would really recommend this place to anyone to go and try.  I'm not sure if what happened to me was a one off.  Just be aware if you book something there yourself."}
{"text":"This is a slightly more expensive dim sum restaurant compared to the other ones I usually go to. However, before 11, they do have a special pricing of $2.80 a dish.  I thought that the food tasted like any other dim sum restaurants. I do like their pumpkin congee over some of the cheaper restaurants I go to. Also, some of the design they put into the dishes was very cute! The mango pudding was a shape of a fish and the ham sui gok looked exactly like a pear.  The service was a bit lacking because we couldn't find a server when we wanted to get our tea refilled. They do clear off our table quite quickly which was very necessary because we ordered a lot of food for four people.  I can't say I'll come back here because it is on the more expensive side and there weren't any outstanding dishes."}
{"text":"I would've given this place a 3 star if the service was better. It has left me a really bad taste in my mouth I waited 2 weeks to calm down and write this review.   So I came here along with 3 of my coworkers for a monthly dim sum gathering. We ordered the usual, ha gao, steamed beef, radish cake, spring rolls, shrimp rice rolls, octopus, lotus leaf rice and the mango pudding. Everything was so-so except the rice rolls were the smallest I have ever seen in Toronto. It's just a bit longer than the lotus leaf rice. Also, I've never had carrots in my radish cakes?! Kinda odd.   So I asked for the bill and went to the washroom. The bill was around $32 before tips and my coworker paid $50 for it. So we waited for about 5 minutes for the change, it never came. We asked one of the waitresses to check what happened to the bill, she never came back neither did the change. After about another 5 or 6 minutes we asked another waiter in a suit, he came back and told us they \"lost\" the bill. That's such a flat out lie because if they truly lost the bill I highly doubt they would let us leave the restaurant. So my coworker went over to the cashier and asked her what happened to our bill and change, she sighed and said \"We LOST your bill, OK?\" Of course my coworker told her \"no, it's not ok. I want my change back.\" She just ignored my coworker and continued working as if he was transparent. This went on for most of our lunch hour and we have to head back to work so I dragged my coworker and off we left.   Needless to say, this place is kind of sketchy with their practices and I wouldn't recommend this place. It's a shame because a restaurant that's spent so much money renovating is being spoiled by a mere $10.00."}
{"text":"Rude and disrespectful manager lady. Will never go back here again. Snobby attitude bc we didnt want the table by the washroom. This is supposed to be an expensive high end Chinese restaurant but that kind of disrespect to customers is pretty messed up."}
{"text":"This review is only for Dim Sum:  Located in the former Star Walk Buffet location.  The decor is quite high end as they definitively spent money renovating the place.  The good thing like other Yelpers stated is that all S, M and L dim sum dishes are only $2.80 feom 9-11am!  Special and Jumbo however is regular price.  Definitely very good value if you come early however some dishes like noodles and rice dishes can't be ordered till 11am.  Overall food was very good and staff attentive. Definitely worth it if you order during the morning special, but on the expensive side if you go after:)"}
{"text":"Second time here... not as good as my first time a few weeks ago.  Portions were smaller, not as tasty. Maybe because its super busy and they are trying to pump out food as quickly as they can.  It was not satisfying this time around. Sort of a let down, because i suggested this restaurant to our group.  2 stars for food quality. 3.5 stars for service.  0 stars for crowd control, and for the rude lady that wants to get a waiting number when she is behind me in line. Seriously, where do these people come from.  If im in line, and you are behind me, wait your turn!! This is disrespectful and rude!   Will i come here again..... not sure,..."}
{"text":"Price is okay. Food is bad (dinner,  I've never tried the dimsum) . Not one dish was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Like other Chinese restaurants, they allow you to order their Yum Cha menu morning. But I do prefer this restaurant then most others just because their level of service, food quality and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Best place for dim sum in Scarborough, morning tea between 9-11am are exceptional value, staff is super friendly. Their fried noodles and rice dishes are of huge proportion, definitely good value, dinner is also very good, love their king crab dinner, ample parking and good service is why this restaurant is my regular spot."}
{"text":"Great selection of dim sum available for the early bird rate.  Ample seating, good service and clean facilities.   Cash only for 9am-11am service. Fresh pot of tea at request.   Notable dishes: deluxe shrimp dumplings, pan fried lamb dumplings and the steamed spare ribs with garlic and black beans."}
{"text":"Quality and environment is quite nice. They have unique and tasty items that we ordered such as the tapioca durian puff pastry (see picture), the almond mousse pastry, imitation shark fin and black fish egg shumai, herb black chicken, ????? (sp?) this crabmeat egg white dumpling...   It's $1.30 tea per person during morning special, which is a tad higher than other places. $2.80  for L, M and S during morning special as well. So try to come before 11am! It's based on when you submit your order."}
{"text":"Foods were okay but the service was the worst I ever had at yum cha. They messed up the orders, the whole dining time they were keep giving the wrong dishes and I have to remind them I ordered."}
{"text":"A pretty standard dim sum restaurant with staff that just do their job and nothing more. Food was average, service was average, and the place with filled with a lot of people. I am taking off stars because the manager gave me attitude when I asked for a mayo dipping sauce. If you don't have it, be nice about it. Then it took us forever to pay because no one was willing to bring the debit/credit card machine over. Overall, it was average and I'm probably not going to come back."}
{"text":"Great food!!  Price is not bad and the service is good.  We went for dim sum and really enjoyed the food.  Hot, fresh and made to perfection.  I recommend this restaurant as its a place we will be returning to."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my family here last night. The food was really good and the space as well-lit and clean, with attentive service. Would highly recommend their seafood dishes. The steamed fish and Peking duck were great."}
{"text":"Tons of seating at this restaurant, but with their specials, the place fills up early!  We ordered 8 dim sum dishes and none of them disappointed.  The congee was tasty, but the duck egg yolk buns were super delicious and hit the sweet spot."}
{"text":"Among the plethora of Chinese restaurants in the GTA, Royale Fine Dining is located across the street and just a smidgen east from Pacific Mall. They have both Dim Sum and Dinner offerings. The place is upper scale with table linens and chair covers. Formerly the Star Walk (Buffet), the place is fairly large and tables offer more room between each other unlike most of their competitors. The setting is loud, but the atmosphere is nice, the decor rounded out with large screen TV's displaying Chinese Cuisine from Asia. There is ample free parking in the plaza.  We were there for Dim Sum and had a large group (15), but they were able to accommodate with just one table, and it turned out to be no tighter than any other Chinese Restaurant so it was no big deal to us. One of my main reasons for coming here is their ability to handle larger party's, the other is the Lao Sha Bao and the Durian Puff Pastry.  In Hong Kong, Dim Sum (small plates) is synonymous with Yum Cha (drinking tea) and is really intended as a social past time. Getting together with friends to chat or catch up on each others lives while having some tea and a few dishes. In North America, Dim Sum is a meal. These tasty dishes will whet anyone's appetite, and we're all addicts. Rather than rate every dish, I've categorized by star rating what my favourites are, and those I'm not so fond of.  4 Stars: #38. Durian puff pastry #7. Shiu Mai (pork dumpling) #53 Salted Egg Yolk buns with Sand (there's no real sand) #6. Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) #13 Steamed Spare Ribs #37 Deep Fried Squid Tentacles Deep Fried Shrimp Dumplings  3 Stars: #31 Pan Fried Turnip Cake with Chinese Sausage #14 Honey marinated Chicken Feet #17 Cha Sieu Bao (Steamed BBQ Pork Bun) #22 Cuttlefish in Shrimp Paste  2 Stars: #15 Steamed Beef Tripe #26 Lotus Leaf Sticky Rice with Dried Scallops #11 Steamed Pork and Shrimp in Bean Curd Sheet  There wasn't anything that stood way out, but then again, there was also nothing I spit out. Overall a decent place with nice decor and a pleasant dining experience. It is on the pricey side, but it's also one of the only place I know that carries durian puff pastry, or durian anything for that matter. But ultimately you'll have to be the judge, as everyone's palette is different.  If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your company... Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Had a dimsum craving so decided to hit up this place early Saturday morning for their half price special.  When we got there, the place was rocking but we were immediately seated which was a fortunate thing.  We started to order a few dishes. By the end of our meal and to make long story short, this place only gets a 3 star from us.  The service was good but taste wise, it was just average."}
{"text":"Been here many times, Dim Sum at the best plus many more tasty dishes, family from out of town this is the place to bring them"}
{"text":"I arrived in the evening and cannot comment on the dim sum service but dinner was average quality.  Nothing wowed me food wise. For the price point they are in they have a tough battle with other restaurants in the area (fancy crab/lobster place excluded).  The decor is nice and there were plenty of servers to take care of your needs."}
{"text":"Recently I have been here on two occasions: A Chinese Wedding and for Sunday morning dim sum.  Great place for casual meals with the family and friends.    From a dim sum point of view, not the greatest but decent.  Their braids beef stomach/intestine (??) was their best dish.  Congee was also limited and the common one: 1000 year egg with pirknisnt one of them.  Service was Chinese level service which was mediocre at best.  My friends and I came at 9.30am on Sunday and were seated right away (table of 7).  One of my friends had a VIP card which gives 10% off   Wedding meal was decent but again not spectacular.  Decent venue.  Can't complain since it is a decent place but not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Royale Fine Dining opens a week ago at the old Starwalk location after a complete renovation.   Early Bird dim sum special daily from 9~11 with s/m/l  for $2.80 and  the thrifty side of me know I need to come back to try out more items in their dim sum menu!       We ordered a few items to try and they were all well executed:    ??????? (L) Steamed Fresh Crab Meat Dumpling ??????? (S) Steamed Beef Balls w/Mustard Green ???????(M) Steamed Dumpling Filled with Minced Pork & Peanut Chiu Chow Style ??????? (M) Assorted Mushrooms Wrapped in Steamed Rice Noodle ??????? (L) Pumpkin Congee w/Chestnut and Sweet Corn And Of Course ???????(L) Baked Durian Puff Pastry  I will be back soon. Anyone for Early Bird dim sum?"}
{"text":"I went back to try out the Alaskan King Crab and some other dishes. I liked how the crab was made in three different ways and sauces so we can try different parts of the crab different ways. I had a pleasant dinner and the food came out relatively quickly.   Some dishes like the sea cucumber with chicken and tofu was alright. A little on the tasteless side, but it was a unique way of the sauce they made it with. It was my first time trying the sea cucumber with the soy sauce concoction sauce they made it with.   Everything else tasted pretty typical. Nothing struck out in particular that I want to point out."}
{"text":"This is a new dimsum place that replaced the starwalk buffet (terrible place by the way)  All small to large dishes are the price of small dish if you submit the order before 11 (as compared to other dimsum where you have to finish by 11). That is a great deal - also means that the line before 11 is huge.  I recommend going around 930-10.   Presentation of food is impressive. We tried this fake crab dumpling and it looked like little goldfishes. The chefs have paid attention to detail in the quality of the food.   Best of all, they use little MSG so you won't feel thirsty afterwards. (Msg has a huge negative effect on me after eating so this is a huge measure of quality for me)"}
{"text":"This is the new place that took over Starwalk Buffet.  I came here on a Saturday morning for Dim Sum and it was packed as expected.  They had early bird special .. 2.80 S-L items... Tea is 1.50 a person.. so drink up..   big tea cups.which is good..  i am convinced this place is the same owners as paramount fine cuisine banquet hall just north of hwy 7... the dimsum menu is almost exact.  The bad part is, service is quite slow.   Food was okay.. it doesnt match up with Dragon Boat but isnt too bad since its closer for me.  I would probably come back.  Ambience is very nice and new... very grand as they gutted the place almost completely.  The theme with these fancy chinese restaurant now seems to be a giant screen playing random chinese shows."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of five people on a Saturday around 9.30am to take advantage of their morning discount ($3.50/dish all sizes, up to 11am only) and before the huge rush of customers. Overall the food was average and the service was standard. The siu mai, har gow, fried tentacles, and turnip cake were okay. Sadly the tripe and chicken feet were quite plain. However, we did like the puff pastry with century duck egg (highly recommended). We ordered many other dishes and had some left overs. In total, our bill came up to about $77 (taxes included).  Royal is quite spacious with restaurant having a center stage with a screen. There's ample lighting and then decorations are somewhat dated but still decent. The staff are generally responsive and friendly enough. Lastly, there's lots of parking in the plaza."}
