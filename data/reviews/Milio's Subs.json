My sub was pretty good but I asked for it on wheat bread, for some reason it came on white??

Also, you forgot my pickle... I was extremely hungover and craving a pickle. I blame my slow recovery on you."}
{"text":"Just about every Friday I order the same thing, sub, cookie and soda, light ice. The soda would come loaded with ice so about 3 weeks ago I changed it to no ice and for 3 weeks it has come LOADED with ice. I would rather drink a warm soda than a watered down one. I also changed the French bread to garlic herb wrap, and guess what? I came on the French bread. Even though I am a repeat customer, they still need to read my order and notes. One more try and if it's wrong again, I will give up and order from somewhere else."}
