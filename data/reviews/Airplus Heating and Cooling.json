{"text":"READ THIS BEFORE ITS TO LATE In Dec 2014 I contacted Airplus Heating and cooling in regards to the installation of a gas boiler and water heater needed. They sent out there sales rep Dave to provide a quote for the install. After much research and discussion with airplus including the owner Bill , Airplus made a proposal to install a slant fin boiler and giant water heater. The price was to include removal of the existing and installation of the new boiler and water heater, including all necessary components, piping and venting for around 10k. The warranty was to cover all equipment for 5 years on parts and labour. We made the agreement and installed was completed and certified by a Airplus technician Ever year since i have had issue with the boiler firing up, i would call Airplus for a no heat call and they would dispatch a technician to access This summer I had third party to perform a independent certification on the unit. As i have had continued issues. The boiler and hot water heater was not installed correctly and did not pass certification by the independent third party that is licenced to perform work on a slant fin boilers. Inadequate ventilation was provided to the boiler and water heater. This in turn reduced the reliability, efficiency and put my self and tenants in harm of depleting the oxygen in the area which would cause suffocation/death. The unit should have never been certified from the start. Repairs were made, by myself and the technician which cost me out of my own pocket approx $350 So when i fired up the boiler again it will not start. i contacted Airplus regarding the issue. they told me they could come in couple days. as they only have one boiler technician. The day of the appointment i was contacted saying they would be canceling my appointment as the tech was in the hospital and would not know when he would get out. they also said that they would have to charge a diagnostic change of $175. i told them that i had a five years part and labour warranty through them and emailed their office my documentation. including bill of sale, agreement proposal and emailed conversation from the rep to myself. I was then told the following day that my warranty through them was null and void and that any further work would be charged at $175 per hour. Do yourself a favour a skip this company. they don't stand behind there work or warranty."}
{"text":"Our aging HVAC system completely failed. We are located in Oakville and were referred to John at Air Plus by soccer friends who had used them before. I called at the end of the day Wednesday and he had his team at our home the next morning Thursday to inspect the problem. In the end the best option was to replace the entire system. John at Air Plus gave us a very competitive price on a fantastic American Standard HVAC system and they installed it the next Thursday within 7 days from our call! WOW!! We are truly happy with their terrific service, quality product and price. John and his team went out of their way to get this done quickly. I have and will continue to recommend Air Plus!! Again - big thanks to John and all the team at Air Plus!!"}
{"text":"Poor service and aggressive pricing. My gas furnace had a faulty integrated circuit control board. The technician had mis-diagnosed the problem as a faulty pressure sensor but did not let it run through the cycle to test it before he left. He was in a hurry to run to the next appointment. The furnace failed again. He returned again with a new air pressure switch and installed this.. Again, he left before running the furnace through cycle. The furnace failed again. He returned again and propery diagnosed the problem as a failed microswitch on the circuit board and replaced it. The total bill was half the price of a new furnace and 4 days with no heat. Simply inexcuseable bad service. Perhaps other technicians in the company are better, however their pricing is aggressive. Not recommended."}
