{"text":"La flor de Calabaza es un lugar como ningun otro en Phoenix. Musica en vivo, bebidas y deliciosos aperitivos. Excelente servicio, la chica que nos atendio nos ofrecio muy buenas sugerencias en cuanto a bebidas y los aperitivos. la musica es Rock en espanol. Es un lugar donde te puedes divertir y estar en un ambiente tan padre entre amigos. Definitivamente regreseramos."}
{"text":"the food is great, always fresh tasting and authentic. the churros are probably the best ive had in a long time. plus tuesdays are 99 cent margaritas"}
{"text":"Okay, for starters I myself am Mexican and I cannot stress this enough. This is NOT Mexican food. It was so bad. The food was overpriced, everything was bombarded with onions and bell peppers. The service was super bad, took my mom 15 minutes to get a margarita and that was because she called a waitress and asked about it. There were about 4 other parties there, so I do not know what could take so long. The band that played tonight was BAD. I'm all for giving local bands a chance but this band just seemed like a bunch of 30 year old hipsters that needed to prove they could still be in a band. I don't like trashing places but this place was just not a good experience. their water was probably the best thing there. oh, and parking is expensive too, so good luck if you decide to come here."}
{"text":"Too loud if you are looking for a place to chat.  Food was not very good.  Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Is this place even open anymore? Went to La Flor for lunch today. Large exterior signs touting their serving \"Lunch and Dinner.\" Small sign posted on interior door listing their open hours beginning at 4 p.m. Loser business"}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place my and my husband came tonight to enjoy a dinner my drink mefias de seda was really good but the food ......I ordered Chile en Nogada if you speak Spanish is on the name nogada the sauce have to have pecans this one is a SWEET sauce way to sweet for be a dinner plate they put cranberries in top come on the traditional plate gets dinner pomegranate seed on top Not cranberries the beans from a can really mexican joint with beans from a can and the rice flavorless  very disappointed maybe we give it another try for the tortas but I'm not sure"}
{"text":"This place is dumb. They charge you a cover to sit down and eat. We left, the guy at the door refused to let us in even though we had reservations for a birthday dinner at 8:30pm"}
{"text":"My friend and I wandered in here looking for lunch. The place was absolutely empty and the decor is very much night club.  I was hesitant to stay and order but my friend insisted. I'm so glad I listened to her. Lunch was delicious. I had three tacos (chicken, beef & pork) ordered a la cart.  My friend had queso blanco enchiladas. The food was fresh and flavorful. We were both absolutely thrilled with our lunches.  Service was attentive(duh, we were the only people there) and very friendly.   I would definitely come back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times before and Ive never had a good experience but I tried to always support this local business specially being part of the mexican or Hispanic community, after making a negative review on FB I decided to give sad but true bad experience about this place, one of the people who works there took my review as the worst thing ever and not only mine but all negative reviews were responded as a f..off, by some guy name Gabriel, this place lacks almost of everything, first, service obviously with a manager/owner or else like Gabriel you can only expect employees just like him, no motivation, no passion no nothing, therefore bad service, the place is very small so it gets very crowded at some events,while some people complained about that, again this guy Gabriel received  it as an offense telling people \"if you don't like it, then leave!\" It's just funny to see no intention to satisfy any request or complain from this place, they offer a service they don't even know how to serve!!, I mean it's really sad to find places like this representing not only Hispanic community but a state and a industry as food, I only can not recommend this place. Thankfully there are other places willing to treat me right as a person, customer and make business.Thank you."}
{"text":"Food was good but they service sucked and the check can faster then my drink and the bar tender was a ass hole... Never again I promise"}
{"text":"This place has great potential, but I think it needs some work. The dance floor is tiny (is really not even a dance floor, more like a small open area). The cover bands are pretty good and when I was there the band (NOVA from Sonora) sang some pretty good Spanish rock/pop covers which gives the place a a nice Latino vibe. What I didn't like was that when the band took a break, the DJ played Pit Bull and Daddy Yankee type of music, when most of the crowd was obviously over 35. The DJ music did not compliment the crowd or the live Spanish rock/pop music. The beers are pricey too (miller lite bottle-5$, Pacifico-6$, this after paying a 10$ cover)."}
{"text":"Service was not good, food was ok, would not go back, I had the torta and was not impressed."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the music and the food.  Real Mexican food with a great environment. Make sure you stop by if your in the area and having the tacos is an absolute must."}
{"text":"Went for a night out with friends & family. Got there after 10pm & paid a $10 cover. There was a live Latin Rock band playing covers. Nice vibe and great drinks calls for a pretty good night. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here last Wednesday. We had been wanting to go for a long time because my friend wouldn't stop talking about the food and the music. We had company from out of town so we decided to finally make the trip from El Mirage. I called in advance to make sure they were open and the singer would be there. The man that answered the phone told me our singer wasn't there that night but there were 2 others and they closed at 2:00 am. We get there at 11:50 and the waitress informs us they're closed. The entertainers are gone and the kitchen is closed. (We were starving) She said we can go in but only for drinks, so we proceed to take a table & order a round of drinks. I explain to her that I called ahead and ask who the person that answered was. It was the bartender. I go talk to him and he explains that the night just died so they let the singers go and the kitchen closed. He was very nice and friendly and we could tell he felt bad.  One of the cooks is nearby and he offers to cook us some appetizers, which were amazing! They played all our favorite music, and treated us like royalty. Our very lovely waitress even made several calls to find us a big enough Uber for our group!! Shot out to Gerardo, Andrea and Juan for turning a negative situation into an amazing experience!! We will absolutely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome guacamole with queso fresco. Clearly fresh and homemade. Delicious carne asada taco. No line, hardly any wait for food. A hidden gem..."}
{"text":"Sorry, a lot more hype than it is really worth.  Food was good.  Service was bad. One person working the whole restaurant.  Super slow and we were the only table there."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim instead of heading to a different restaurant down the street because my bf loves Mexican food. I wanted sushi. So I agreed. We came in and sat down. The waitress was super nice and recognized my bf which was surprising but cool. She checked on us often. Everything we ordered was huge and filling and effing delicious. I ordered the enchiladas Suiza, and he ordered 4 tacos, carne asada and cochinita. We ordered the coctel de elote as an appetizer and chips and salsa. The carne was real carne asada and the coctel elote was delicious, creamy, flavorful, especially when we added more lime. The enchiladas were cheesy but not too cheesy and had the perfect amount of sauce. They were amazing. perfect. I couldn't stop taking bites from each plate to focus on just one.. I'm coming here often, definitely loved it. Next time I want to try the chimichangas but will probably get the same order I did today"}
{"text":"Love this place , live band , good food , great service , good date spot, went for a work dinner, walked around the area, will be back SOON !"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in quite awhile. I went here with my boyfriend last Friday. When we walked in a waitress (?) told us to sit wherever. She brought us our menus and told us our server would be with us in a minute. There was only 2 other tables seated.  We sat there for 15 minutes while she brought food and drinks to other tables. She made eye contact several times as we waited with no water and no check-in from the server (she was the only one I saw working there).   We went to the front so we could speak to someone before we left, but no employees even walked by the entrance for several minutes. We walked out."}
{"text":"This place is super fun!  Had a great experience here a few months ago looking for a low-key hangout in Downtown Phoenix.  I was pleasantly surprised with the live latin jazz and the food options were great too!    I recommend if you're looking for a smaller place free of heavily intoxicated people, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"First of this is not the first time I come this place and I truly enjoy coming here for the food , and the drinks ! HOWEVER I find it almost ridiculous that I have to pay a $10.00 cover fee JUST TO GET IN ! I came to have dinner with a couple girlfriends & the service was horrible , we had to find OUR OWN TABLE it was just uncomfortable , i really wouldn't mind paying the cover fee if service level was up to par , however that was not the case Saul was our waiter and felt like he was a completely  unprofessional and rude. I would come here more often to just enjoy their amazing good , but it's ridiculous to have to pay $10.00 cover fee per person."}
{"text":"This place is still trying to figure itself out. The decor is simple, so it made me think they must be saving all of the excitement for the food. I ordered chicken tinga and some pork tacos. The meat in both tacos was pretty decent, but the tortillas were too oily. I suggest frying the tortilla longer or just grilling them? I'd love to give them a second try, perhaps to try one of their specialty dishes."}
{"text":"What can I say,, really bad, bad everything. not only the service but the food.. We went there to celebrate a birthday and I bought a Yelp coupon to use this time they \"redem\"' my coupon but my discount was 0 yes  zero and they told me we already applied to my account..whatever never coming back to that place."}
{"text":"Another reviewer said it best: prices are on the high end, overall feel is on the low end, and food is mediocre. I got the taco de cochinita pibil, the tortilla was hard like it hadn't been heated long enough. The empanadas were super greasy to the point that it overpowered everything, and the namesake quesadilla de flor de calabaza looked and tasted like something you'd get at Filiberto's. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Great spot for live Latino Rock. Drinks are tasty and the service is attentive. My favorite day is Saturday nights. The cover sucks but once you get past that it's a great atmosphere. Order the empanadas to suck up the adult beverages. I recommended it to those who just want something different. Empanadas!"}
{"text":"First time at this place and I will not recommend this place at all.  Food is not authentic Mexican, the rice taste like box rice. The food has no flavor. Our food was cold and when asked to reheat and brought back it was extremely hot.  The one star is for atmosphere, music is awesome and the place is very clean.  The price is normal we spend $47 with one soda, two enchilada plates and one empanadas appetizer."}
{"text":"Fun place and great music. Came for dinner before dancing and the food was on point. We also had someone in our party pass out for other health reasons and the manager or owner (not sure) was on the scene ASAP and handled it very well. Great place! It does get very crowded though and the music is very loud so be prepared! :)"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but not wow for the price that I paid...it worried me a little when the waitress asked me how I wanted my chicken cooked."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today at 11:30 and the doors were locked despite signs all over saying \"now open\" so I'm giving it 1 star. There were waiters inside who quickly moved away from the door when we approached. I have no idea what that was about. We'd love to try it and will give it a shot again later, but it was an odd experience to say the least."}
{"text":"We came in with a party of 6 in a Sunday morning for the mariachi show. Our waitress had no idea what she was doing. She asked for our order 3 separate times and still missed some plates. We were there for 2.5 hours waiting. No refills on water nor coffee. 3 of us never got our food. We still had to pay. Service is despicable. The food is not that great. To top it off, I witnessed the bar tender sipping some drinks he had just made with the same straw before he handed them out to other patrons."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, and friendly service in a space with a distinct Latin flair (bachata music was playing when my friend and I dined here). The enchilada I ordered was covered in Oaxacan mole - just take note of that, as people who are accustomed to standard red or green enchilada sauces may not be used to this dark, sweet preparation."}
{"text":"What the hell is with these guys??   Walked in and were told to seat ourselves... Ten minutes went by and no one even said hello. All their servers were avoiding eye contact when we tried to get their attention.   My buddy said they racially profile here (you must be Latin) I thought he was crazy until I experienced it myself.   Boo to this place for life."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here and I am so impressed! First of all, the waitress didn't write any of our orders down- indicating she was an actual professional. The food was so delicious. The goat cheese chimichanga desert was amazing!! Finally, there was a live band that made the atmosphere so much better. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and I'm so glad I did. The breakfast is absolutely delicious and they have live music. The service is great as well, definitely recommend if you're looking for new places to eat!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service * came in with a group of 12 people for my birthday dinner . Took 30 min for drinks to come back to our table which finally we had  to go get our drinks from the bar numerous times . I gave a 1 star based on food , the food is excellent !!"}
{"text":"Came here around noon on a Saturday...  4 stars for food n friendliness. Rib eye tacos are great! Food seems reasonably priced but the beers are 6 dollars. The Micheladas are 8.50.  Oof. That's super expensive, in my opinion. We'll come back to eat, then drink where the prices are much more reasonable.  Staff were extremely friendly and cannot emphasize that enough. The owner (i think) was super friendly and brought the chef out for us to answer our food questions. Place needs a lot more ambiente (ambience) though in order for people to feel like they want to hang out n drink, n eat, n drink more. The back of house had music n you.could hear them singing....Just.wish they'd bring that up front."}
{"text":"The service there was horrible. I walked in and didn't see a hostess. Finally sat down at the bar and looked at a menu. Was acknowledged but never got service. The bartender and another gentleman were too busy discussing business. Waited patiently for 15 minutes and finally just got up and walked out."}
{"text":"Squash Blossom is closed, replace by this awesome Mexican joint. From the art on the walls to the cocktails served in real glasses to the live music and flamenco dancer, this place has improved by no less than 3,000%.   Let's face it, Squash Blossom was a little weird. It always felt like one of those motel restaurants you eat at when you're driving through bat country. The new look and feel is definitely less weird, and in fact has a great ambiance.   We went for an appetizer and drink, just to check it out. We had the guacamole, which was fantastic. Very fresh and lime-y, with an added bonus of what I believe to be currants, but may have been craisens. Either way, it was delish. We also had the quesadilla, which was fried. It's hard to mess up fried cheese, and this did not disappoint. Served with fresh tortillas, this was a perfect snack before a night out on the town.   I asked the waitress (who was super nice and very helpful) what her favorite cocktail was, and she recommended The Bull. I don't know what was in it, but DAMN was it good. All I know is there was fresh lime juice. Highly recommended.   To top it off, the kitchen is open late, which is a great addition for downtown Phoenix, because that's an area we are currently lacking in. They are open for brunch on Sunday, I can't wait to try it out!"}
{"text":"ok, I'm a little worried for two reasons. First, the average rating doesn't match my experience at all and second, at lunchtime, I'm the only one here. So, given that, the staff is particularly attentive to me. Service is great and speedy. I'm thanked for coming in by multiple people. I asked my server for a recommendation on lunch and she steered me towards the tacos. They're $3.50 each. I opt for shrimp. What is delivered is really beautiful. I'm sorry that I didn't take a photo. Two shrimp tacos that are full of flavor and a perfect lunch. They are spicy! I love that but do recognize that if I was not a fan of spice and had ordered these, they came this way without a warning. I will go back here and I will also see if they cater - they're close to my office and I could order lunch in if its available.  This place is a little hard to find the way it is tucked into the back of the building behind another restaurant but I hope you do try it and that they stay in business."}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I start? The menus. I couldn't read a word on them. That means I'm at an authentic Latin restaurant. So I close my eyes and throw my finger at the menu and it lands on enchiladas Suiza. AMAZING. The cheese on top, the beans and rice. HOLY SHIT. Sorry for my language but HOLY SHIT. So good. Also, the house margs. HOLY SHART. So good. The staff too. The pregnant waitress! So nice! Everyone! 5 stars. 5 shartin' stars, man. I recommend! I recommend! Peace   A"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is amazing! I do have to say that it's slightly confusing because where it's located. Keep in mind that front of the building is a pizza restaurant; the back where this restaurant is.  Service was impeccable! Maria Fernanda was our waitress - very helpful, prompt, and attentive. All waiters predominantly speak Spanish so you might need to brush up on some Spanish words.   I started my meal with 2 good sized tacos. I got the shrimp and pollo Saadi. The shrimp was good sized (not a pathetic little thug) and was dressed with cabbage and a garlic aioli. The pollo asado was a lean cut (i'm sure it was chicken breast; surprisingly not dry or plain. The corn tortilla is a frail and break easily (not so fun). It comes with lime and salsa that compliments it very well (hot sauce was not spicy at all). Also, Tacos are about 2.75 to 3.5 a taco.  My entree was La Chorreada, a chimichanga dressed with mild, slightly zesty green salsa, cheese and a whole bunch of amazingness. The meat was a mix of chicken, steak, and shrimp (really helps with my indecisiveness). The flavor was through the roof! Best chimichanga I've had (and I've had quite a few).  Also, tried the Enchilada Suizas - cooked perfectly. Sauce was tasty and creamy. Not as amazing as the La Chorreada though.  Also have lounging after hours for Latin music. I gotta check this out."}
{"text":"Very good music and the appetizers were delicious! The waitress was wonderful as well. Overall the experience was great and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My service and food were MUCH better than the numerous experiences reported below. I wonder if this was a fluke.   Our server was good and attentive for brunch on a Saturday morning.   The building is a little weird and divey feeling. The prices were high for the atmosphere. The dining room also doubles as a bar/band performance stage. It was a little awkwardly set up and didn't seem very fancy or exciting to warrant the prices they listed on the menu.   Another weird thing that happened is that I purchased the $10 for $20 Yelp deal while I was there. I showed the server before we ordered to let her know, and she asked to take my phone to check the coupon with the manager. They had no less than a 10 minute discussion about it across the room. They clearly had never seen this coupon and had no idea what to do with it. They seemed very unprepared.   All of this being said, it was a good experience. Our food was okay and the service was attentive."}
{"text":"When I went in I didn't try the food but my buddies said it was pretty good.  The atmosphere was cool, live music was on point. The only negative was the service, our server wasn't too interested in seating us, and didn't really come around our table to see if we were doing okay. Still I think it's worth checking out for your own, give it a chance."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Best place for live Spanish Rock in the heart of downtown. Love this bar."}
{"text":"Horrible place, had their coctel de elote and got some canned yellow corn! Hope it was a bad night, singers were drunk as hell or they sounded like it. Couldn't get the guts to try anything else. Thank God its in the back hidden! No one should endure this pain!"}
{"text":"We eat all around Downtown Phoenix and have been trying to go here for a long time. Seems that even when the sign is on the sidewalk saying lunch specials, we would get to the front door and they were closed. Finally last night we saw the sign saying they were open and could hear the music. It drew me, my boyfriend, and my daughter to go inside with excitement to finally try something new. When you enter there is nowhere to stand to be greeted. You are standing in between tables just standing wondering where to go. A lady turned around from the bar and sat us with menus. Difficult to see because it's so dark inside. We were ready for drinks and water but nobody came. We sat there for about 15 minutes and still no water. Maybe it was the music that was so loud that kept the waitress from coming back to us. Perhaps it's because we tip well that she didn't want to wait on us. Well at any rate..we stood up and I handed a man our menus. He asked if we were ready to order food. Yikes. No water yet, but wants us to order. We walked out...thank you Pomo for rescuing us!!!!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this spot. Really good food and drinks. Coming back tonight for the live Latin music."}
{"text":"Although the visit started out as pleasant, it ended very poorly. First off, the food was okay and the piña colada was delicious. The guac was just some chopped up avocado with not a lot of flavor, and the carne asana taco was flavorful. The service was slow, especially since there was only one other table in the entire restaurant that the server was helping. We had asked for 3 shots of inexpensive tequila reposado, and ended up getting charged $36 for 3 shots (which we were told would be $8 each, not $12). The piña colada was advertised as $8.00 but we were charged $8.50, the guac was advertised as $6,  but we were charged $9 for it. The server, Miros, said that this was all due to \"tax\", but tax was also taken off of the total amount. She was very shady and rude, and didn't give us any straight answers. Both my husband and myself work in the service industry so we are usually very understanding and always appreciative of the service we receive, but this was just unacceptable. We will not be returning. We are highly upset and dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Churros were terrible. The quesadillas were alright. Their chips are so greasy and deep fried it should be a sin. The salsa is alright. Spicy and fresh. I ordered off Uber eats on thanksgiving and my options were limited! So what can you really expect!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever , owner manager had excuses for everything beer hot , waiting list not going according, plates given at separate times like a 1/2 hour or longer , food not good no flavor 3 or more tables left after ordering"}
{"text":"Food was great. We happened to drop in on a day where a mariachi band was playing. Their performance was very pleasant, but minus one star for the trumpet player being 2x the volume of everything else in a 5 mile radius, and also not letting the gal with the great voice sing lead in any songs. I will definitely return, but if the band is playing I might choose to sit in the outdoor patio to save my ears.  Update: I added the fifth star back in after re-reading my receipt. I just realized the suggested tip is CORRECTLY based on the pre-tax amount. Sadly, this is the first time I've seen a restaurant do this... EVER!  So, props to the management for not trying to rip-off the customer with this common underhanded trick."}
{"text":"We came here for my brothers birthday party. Oh God they had the worst customer service. First of all, my friend and her mother came along and order chips and salsa and the waitress said \"oh we are out.\" She didn't even apologize or anything then we asked for water and the water tasted horrible!!!! We told her the water tasted horrible and she said \" well let me check if we have bottle water.\" Her face expression was horrible. Never coming to this place again! !!"}
{"text":"-10!! If I could give a negative number I would!!! So I RESERVED just to make sure our Mother's Day would be amazing!! And also because we knew it would be packed if we didn't. Waited for 1hour and 37 minutes and we had it. Talked to people multiple times to ask why we waited for an hour already AFTER making a reservation. Thought maybe some water would be offered to us!!! Nothing, was not the only party waiting who made reservations, a party of 15 or 18 where waiting Even longer! And had kids and no water was given to them either, three families including mine left. We were so appalled never to come back again. The manager seemed so clueless? Like do you have no authority to help us? Standing there not knowing what to say to us. If you can't honor your word with reservations say so. don't ruin families day out. Don't believe me go to this place on a holiday and make reservations in advance. Horrible service. Please don't go here..."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. It was busy so the wait was longer than expected but the food and drinks where completely worth the wait!! The service was extremely friendly and had a homey feel. We will definitely come back and highly recommend a visit!!"}
{"text":"the first clue was that we were the only ones in there for lunch. for 13.50 (thank god we had a groupon) the enchildas suizas was probably worth about 4.00. and on top of that, they left off the onions and cilantro that was on the menu to make it sound yummy. 13.50 and still hungry. maybe this place is jumping at night. the pieces of steak in the salad was very good though....oh, by the way that was 10.50, for 4.00 worth of meat..."}
{"text":"Awful!!!Our server was friendly but clearly overwhelmed. They didn't have enough staff for the amount of people in there. I believe I saw a total of 3 waitresses. We had to wait 30 minutes before placing an order and at least another 30 minutes for our food to arrive and everyone's food came out at different times. Wait time for drinks was also ridiculous. Our table was right in front of the bar so when it got busier and the bar got backed up people were standing right next to our table as we were eating. We went there for dinner and the band. We had a large bill from drinks and food but still were asked during our meal to pay an additional 10.00 per person to stay and watch band. They had security but the security was there to go around and ask people for the extra 10.00 instead of making sure people weren't standing in front of tables blocking the view of the people who had actually paid for dinner and the show. Lastly, the bathroom situations were weird. The men's bathroom was located outside and the woman's restroom had urinals and toilets inside."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience I've had in a while.  Food came out prepared incorrectly and not even the thing I ordered.  Management had excuses, none of which was an apology.  Whatever. This dump can't and won't last much longer.  With such a revival in the downtown area underway, it's embarrassing that this restaurant thinks it belongs with the product they're putting out."}
{"text":"What a bad experience after standing for fifteen minutes they would even sit us not only that when we finally got seated we order something as simple as a torta ahogada and they were out of it also I ask for empanadas de chicharrón and they were also out of them the table we sat on was wobbly  it was hot there were mariachis seating on a table and their instruments on a different one right on the AC part so they sat us almost outside smh we cancel our order and left it's really sad cus this was one of my favorite places to eat and my family was visiting from Mexico I wanted them to be amaze by the food and the quality but it all just went bad ."}
{"text":"Can't complain that much.  The food was ok, NoT exellent.   A little over priced for the type of food (not Barrio Cafe obviously)       Good music, had fun."}
{"text":"I really like this place for hanging out I like the fact that they play spanish rock on weekends And the food its good specially the fajitas de pollo"}
{"text":"Ignore every review.  This place is awesome. Downtown Phoenix...the best Mexican food in the area.  It's fresh. Good service.  Attentive.  Refried beans are legit!  Rolled tacos are fantastic.  Chips and salsa are FREE.  Everywhere else they charge. I don't need fancy Mexican food.  I need GOOD and AFFORDABLE."}
{"text":"The photos posted for this place look amazing and enticed me in!  But I'll never go back.  First, the pricing is on the higher end for Mexican food.  But the atmosphere is \"hole in the wall\", and the food was mediocre at best.    The service started out terrible, although the server told us it was her first day.  My table was 2 of 4 customers in the entire restaurant.  15 minutes later, my husband still didn't have his drink--a coke.  I waived at the server, who was behind the bar, and asked if we could get my husband's drink.  She brought out a coke and set it in front of me.  I was holding a baby, and I told her the drink was my husband's.  She responded that she didn't want to walk all the way to the other side of the table!    We reminded her we ordered chips and salsa.  15 minutes later, I asked for chips and salsa and a new server.  The new server we got was friendly and seemed competent.  But it was too late.  My husband's food was put in wrong.  My food came out cold.  And nothing we saw resembled the plates that looked so appealing on Yelp.    We left and ordered a pizza.  #Pomo"}
{"text":"Very poor service, even though the restaurant was not busy. Waited long stretched for our server, who didn't clear the plates on our table or come back for checks. It was the world cup, in a Mexican restaurant with Mexico playing and they kept turning the sound off the TV's. Mariachi was fun. Food was meh and took a very long time. Split our checks incorrectly and took a half hour to do so. Mostly frustrated with the service."}
{"text":"I've visited this place on two occasions. One for a cover band show and the other for mother's day brunch. Two totally different occasions but with a few consistencies. One, the bathroom situation is really awkward. The area where the sink is is shared and is where everyone waits for the restroom. Second, the service at our table and the bar was slow. The drinks are over priced.   When we went there for brunch is was incredibly packed and we waited two hours for our food. Luckily they had an all female mariachi playing which was a pleasant distraction while we waited for our food. The food was actually good but I had loaded up on chips and salsa so I wasn't able to finish it all.   Overall I would like to visit this place again and give it another chance when it's not a holiday."}
{"text":"It was 6:30pm or so on a Thursday night, the sign clearly said the place was open at 4:00.  My friends and I walk in and there is no customers nor is there any staff.  We nervously stand around for around 10 minutes or so.  A gentleman comes out and I say hello with hope in my eyes hoping for service.  He says hi back, walks into the back and then we wait a few minutes and nothing.  It was the first time I ever felt horribly awkward going to a restaurant in my life.  Considering I didn't even get served I would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"This is a great venue for a fun get together. Great service, excellent foodWe had a nice time on a Sunday afternoon here as a family. Must try the churros."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. The patio is dog friendly too! Awesome omeletes de la casa"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst restaurant services that I have had. There's a disorganization in th whole kitchen, my party and I have been waiting over 3 hours now for our food, and the worst of all is the appetizers have t even come in either. They have been giving us one plate of food per hour. People have been coming in and out with their plates and we just keep being forgotten. I hope this restaurant reorganizes their standards in the quality of service that they provide."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food I've ever had and I ain't lying I'm a chef myself and the dishes look great and most of all taste great ! These dishes speak for themselves"}
{"text":"Worst service the worst michalada I have ever had and to make things worse the bar tender got mad because I told him that it was no good...."}
{"text":"Really loved this place.  I ordered two appetizers: Guacamole Street corn   And for my meal I got two chicken tacos.  The guacamole and tacos were incredible. My sister really enjoyed the street corn.   My meal was $23 which was a great price for the size and quality of the food.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"99 cent margaritas on a Tuesday? Awesome Tacos? Great Empanadas? If you said yes please to any of these questions.. YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE!   So close to 5 stars.. this place is a hidden gem. Its hidden behind pomo pizzeria, and a whole different atmosphere. The food is fantastic, now lets work on our cocktails. My pina colada was... well.. not fantastic. The food i got made up for that.  Loved this place and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We ordered through Grubhub from this place, the ETA was for an hour which was fine. When we noticed the delivery was running behind, I contacted the store and got no response. After contacting Grubhub which then contacted the store we then learned our order was cancelled on behalf of the restaurant because they were busy. That was even ok, but why not have the common decency to call the customer? Why wait the entire hour? So yea that wasn't a great experience."}
{"text":"Been here 4x now. The best thing on the menu is the chips and guacamole. BEST EVER - HANDS DOWN. I've had fairly good experiences with the carne asada tacos and quesadillas. According to my boyfriend, their chilaquiles is very good as well. Also, great live music."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking to go out to eat downtown after his gig and thought we would check out the new restaurant next to the Turf...Pomo.  Well.  Guess not.  They were closing at 11 and we were ready to eat and drinka nd hang out on the patio.  SENS, why did you MOVE? I don't like the new patio you have...sorry...  I digress.  Anyhow, as the story goes, we were standing around thinking maybe we would have an amazing rum drink at Breadfruit and then we heard music.  Did I mention my hubby is a musician?  LIve music?  In this  building?  Wow...let's check it out.  We head towards the back to what is now called \"Squash Blossom\" and wondering to ourselves \"didn't the big sign outside say Breakfast and Lunch only?\"  Hmm...this is promising...  And it was amazing. It was like walking into another world. The seemingly boring back space that was impossible to fill when it was the PastaBAR is now hopping and I mean - HOPPING with people listening to latin music and dancing and drinking and loving life.  We had to be part of it...so we waited for a table to open up and snagged it and ordered late night eats and drank fun drinks that we had NO IDEA was in them and listened to live music and had a BLAST.   Everything is in Spanish, even the name...which we quickly realized was a Spanish version of Squash Blossom (who they share the space with). Brilliant (I love stuff like that). We were served by no less than 4 folks (primarily a fellow named David who was so charming!) who hovered over the tables like bees on flowers.  It was skillful and terribly flattering.  I loved that they cared. They asked for feedback on the amazing guacamole and offered suggestions on some fun drinks.  They asked us to come back again.  Who does that?  REALLY who does that?  They came by, shook our hands and looked me in the eyes and said \"we would love it if you came by again and joined us for dinner, thank you for coming.\"  Honestly, ithis was one of the most remarkable experiences I have had in Phoenix.  The unique food and drinks as well as the lovely service and amazing patrons of this \"Latin Lounge\" made us feel perfectly at home - even though we don't know how to salsa or speak spanish.  The music was wonderful, the band was fun and upbeat.  And for you single folks, there were plenty of tables of ladies and some swarthy good-looking men to meet as well.    I would definately check this place out...we plan to go back for dinner very soon! What a find...."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, especially the tinga and the quesadillas de flor de calabaza. Sangría is good, too. Service was a bit lacking early evening: seems like more of a night spot. But friendly people and decent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is great! Very delicious. I've had food from here a few times and have always enjoyed it. The service could absolutely do some extensive work. Every time there have been things forgotten and courses ignored (appetizers come out after entrees). Atmosphere is a bit of a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Came at 5pm. Could have used some music s it was dead silent.  Very nice place.  Friendly service.  Had the quesadilla w flor de calabaza it was super tasty l, I would order it again. Boyfriend had the enchiladas Suizas that came with rice and beans.  The enchiladas were ok in taste, beans were good but the rice was cold and may have been boxed.  My beef chimichanga was good but I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem is in the southwest corner of 2nd st and McKinley. GREAT place, GREAT tacos, and a MEAN pina colada. Highly recommend this spot. Very cozy and laid back. Good spot for a date fellas."}
{"text":"Wow.... this place may have a translated name of Squash Blossom, but it is nothing like the old squash blossom... in a good way! They completely redecorated and it now has a Latin club feel. A friend and I wandered in here Saturday night after I saw their open sign through the long hallway and wondered to myself....why is that breakfast place open at 9pm? Anyway, we sat at the bar and it was kind of awesome. We met a couple at the bar that were a lot of fun and we all did many shots...We did some series of shots that included tequila, lime juice, clamato, and beer... very interesting! We also did esperma shots (because of the funny name) which were good, shots of fireball with rum chata (delicious), and we had some of their pina colada based drinks that were sweet and tasty. The bar tender was nice and the prices were affordable (shots = 4$, drinks = 6 ish?). The place is on the loud side and I believe they had a DJ. As it got later, the bar got busier but the service remained very efficient and friendly. I had a great time here and would definitely come back.    PS Their food smelled SO good.....I want to try it ASAP... will update."}
{"text":"SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not only was the service SUPER slow, the waiter was rude AF.  Needless to say, this wasn't the first time that happened. Won't be coming back any time soon.  On a good note: The owner is very nice. Too bad for his employees."}
{"text":"Great food great music!!!  This place is fun, and the food is authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Nice place of the beaten path. .. sort of.  The tuna melt wad very good and they had a nice selection of draft beers.  The server,  Alyssa, was great.  Def a do-over."}
{"text":"After one visit, I was sold on this place. I ordered the gordita de chicharron plate and was wonderfully surprised. Initially, I was imagining larger chunks of chicharron but the gorditas were filled with a finer chopped protein. I brought some in for my coworker and he's planning to head there with me soon."}
