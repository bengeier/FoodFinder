{"text":"Brunch copieux et bons burgers mais le service est trèèèèèèès lent. Maam Bolduc vaut quand même le détour pour son menu varié (et très coloré qui pique les yeux)."}
{"text":"Walked here from my b&b off of papineu avenue. Bout a 10 minute walk that was really easy. Cute little corner cafe with outside seating as well as a cozy inside. Walked up to bar and ordered some fish and chips to go. Was worried that they would say no, but it was no problem. While waiting I scanned the interior and saw that they had some domestic (Canada) beer on tap that looked tasty. I did not try any, but will try later this week while I'm finishing up my vacation. Staff was friendly and spoke English and also let me practice my French (which is terrible).  The fish was spot on with the flaky and the batter to fish ratio was perfect. Chips were wack, floppy and greasy, which is normal I guess, but they were not the bomb. However, I did get a side salad w/ a lemon vinaigrette and it was so delish.  So if you are in this part of Montreal, check it out. Prices seemed fair, and they also do burgers too."}
{"text":"New owners since about 3 years. They've added some fancy bistro items to the menu, but the ones I tried were disappointing. Stick to the poutine. I usually get poutine bourguignon. Small is big enough. I don't like their hamburgers much. The \"gros déjeuner\" is my choice for breakfast: eggs, bacon, home fries, fruit, toast, beans, creton. You can order breakfast all day. Another tip: order your poutine over home fries instead of french fries. It's not on the menu, but they'll do it and it's good.  I agree with other posters that their fries aren't the best, can be a bit soggy. But overall the poutine is pretty good.  They get busy Saturday and Sunday for brunch, but other times it isn't hard to get a seat."}
{"text":"I really liked my peppercorn poutine. My friends just had regular poutines and were not wowed to the same extent, but maybe they are just less excited by poutine than I am overall.  Average service, nothing special - once we got our food we never saw anyone again until we went inside to get our bills and pay."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch, and had a pretty good time. The service was not bad, but rather the waitstaff seemed to be overlapping, and weren't sure for a while if we'd been served or not. So maybe it could be more efficient, but they were patient and sweet about our wanting to learn French (and not knowing it yet).  The menu is very sweet - hand drawn and colorful, with tons of choices. I got \"the hangover\" breakfast plate, and it was delicious, with (gasp!) a good portion of meat!  We also had the burger florentine, which came with a small side salad and fries. My only complaint (but it is a big one) is that the lettuce on the burger seemed unwashed, and had LOTS of rotten spots on it. Boo.   The crowds are a bit thick, but it's workable, and the residential location does give off a unique, friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine!! The bourguiguonne one is perfect, as is their 3 cheese poutine (if you like blue cheese). They make 'em right!"}
{"text":"Place is great. Eclectic decor,  helpful, lightning-quick service. Coffee refilled magically. Well worth the trip for breakfast.   Had a breakfast club and it was tasty,  though the potatos weren't my favorite they were OK."}
{"text":"Of course we had to try poutine while visiting Montreal from NYC.  We ultimately wound up here via recommendations from a local who said this was HIS favorite place for poutine (so it had to be excellent!).  The colorful menu & interior were fabulous (though we opted to sit outside that summer day) as was the cool, casual vibe.  Our server was super-personable & he very patiently translated the poutine menu to us.  After considering the numerous savory-sounding options, my husband & I ultimately chose to split the \"Mexican\" variation which in addition to the customary fries, gravy & cheese curds, also included cheddar cheese, red/yellow peppers, onions & \"hot\" peppers (more medium, which was perfect for me).  Holy moly, decadent & delicious... each component of this dish was mighty scrumptious.  As a poutine-virgin, I must say I thought the cheese would be more like cottage cheese but it was reminiscent of fresh mozzarella to me - tasty stuff across the board -  we had to indulge in poutine at least once in our lives!  We left STUFFED & satisfied.... thankfully a looong walk to & through Parc Lafontaine followed!  To drink, hubby enjoyed one of their many fresh fruit juices & I think I had a cherry soda.  They had other non-poutine things that looked tasty - I believe breakfast offerings, sandwiches, etc.  But we came for one reason & left happy that we chose the right place to get it!"}
{"text":"Maybe not the finest food, but a good place to hang out in familly or friends  Typical american food, pretty cozy Cheap with a good service"}
{"text":"Loved the giant funky hand drawn menu-we came for the poutine and it did not disappoint! Staff was friendly and laid back and the prices were super reasonable as well. Yay for cheese and gravy!"}
{"text":"Oh, was this a delicious surprise.  We ordered from Foodora because we were really lazy one night.  Ordered the Pepper Sauce poutine and the Bacon Burger.  The Poutine was VERY pepper-y, i loved it. If you love pepper sauce you'll love this.  The Burger was so juicy and the bacon was perfectly cooked.  This was delivery and it was still fresh and nicely kept together so i imagine in restaurant must be even better."}
{"text":"I have visited Montreal twice now and I made sure that I ate at Maam Bolduc when I returned. The have great food with Poutine that will fill you up for the night. Sitting on the terrace in front on a warm summer night made us feel like locals as did the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Place à brunch cosy et colorée au cur du plateau ! J'ai pris un déjeuner \"classique\" avec ufs et viande accompagné de fruits et de pain. Un plat simple mais copieux. Toutefois, un peu déçue de me voir facturer le thé que je pensais inclut dans la formule \"brunch\" et de n'en avoir été avertie qu'au moment de payer. Le service est plutôt rapide. Assez achalandé le dimanche."}
{"text":"Wow! What a selection! I always Drive by this place on my way home from work and the terrace is always packed!!!  KNOW I KNOW WHY!!!! So many menu items to chose from plus they Don't mind mixing and matching or anything!!! A very chill and relaxing vibe! I got the chicken brochettes with how salad and have straws and it was freaking amazing!!!! It was quick to be seated quick to receive our food and the service was wonderful!! I will definitely be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"I loved their fresh OJ. They top it off with a bit of regular OJ and it gives it the best flavor.  My bf and I had the regular poutine and it wasn't anything out of the ordinary but it was still pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I have to echo what many others here have already said: the service ... the wait times. I'm a fairly patient person, and I was starting to get exasperated. It isn't even the staff themselves, they are pleasant and constantly rushing about, I think they need MORE staff, at least during peak times.  So now that the negative part is out of the way, on to the good stuff! The food is great! Comfort food at its best, I'm looking forward to future meals so I can try out more of the menu. Their fries are awesome! Greasy, sort of mushy, on the thinner side. Perfect in my books. I had a hamburger steak, and it was crispy almost burnt at the edges, and well done all over, and topped with my choice of mushrooms (alternatives were peppers or onions).   The decor is also great: cosy and full of things to look at. It isn't a huge space, and yet they manage to pack a lot of tables in there. I can see myself eating at the bar during a solo dinner, just as much as I can see myself with a group."}
{"text":"Malgré un service moyen et légèrement bâclé offert par le serveur, la nourriture y est plutôt bonne, les assiettes sont copieuses.  Un très grand choix de menus et plats sont offert et les prix affiché sont plutôt honnête. De bon plats pour - de 15$ taxe et tips inclu.  Le resto est propre et pas de mauvaise odeur malgré la cuisine ouverte , ce qui est super sympa et donne un côté comme à la maison."}
{"text":"Lieu sympathique et agréable par excellence à Montréal. J'habite à deux pas depuis un an mais je ne l'ai testé que récemment et franchement j'adore! Déjà le décor est vraiment coloré, super! Bonne ambiance, le gérant est convivial (j'y suis allée avec une habituée alors ça aide aussi).  Gros choix de burgers, sandwichs, déjeuners et de poutines bien sur.  Je me laisse tenter par une poutine végé (oignons, poivrons, champignons) : grosse quantité pour la petite portion. Très bonne, frites maisons et la sauce est bien sympa, une bonne poutine classique pour 9$.  Les burgers sont plus chers : entre 12 et 16$ mais ils ont l'air vraiment bons aussi.  Des bières pressions et même des desserts (pas testés), bref un lieu complet et efficace!"}
{"text":"Ma-Am-M Bolduc is the perfect place to pick a hamburger out of a scrapbook.  This is a quaint little restaurant at the corner of Marie-Anne and De Lorimier. It can be easily spotted from lower orbit by its neon orange banner and colourful mural.  The restaurant rides hard on client fidelity, the appeal and feel of a neighborhood family business, and its somewhat adventurous menu. First time diners will certainly take notice of the mildly disjointed decor (bright paintings, mosaics everywhere, chairs and benches dispersed somewhat randomly) but the \"playground\" feeling disappears almost instantly once seated. Ma-Am-M Bolduc--whose name will now be copied and pasted because it is a pain to type out--makes the most out of DIY presentation, with charming touches like water being served in stripped wine bottles and, again, the scrapbook menu.  The food is serviceable, and sometimes downright delicious. The cooks tend to make the most out of simple meals; the poutines and burgers in particular are almost constant hits, but some more exotic choices can be disappointing in execution.   For instance, there is only one meal in the breakfast menu which includes a stuffed baked potato. It's somewhat stuffed. It's not exactly baked. In another confusing accident, I asked for a glass of orange juice and received the pulpy remains of a savagely assaulted citrus. I actually had to chew the pulp before swallowing gulps. These little hiccups mean I wouldn't feel comfortable ordering \"anything\".  I would advise taking a chance with the items featured on the blackboard. Generally, these are fresh twists on old classics and rarely miss their mark. They also have a small but decent selection of beers on tap, always a plus. The day menu also offers a good selection of fairly priced meals, all of them reliably tasty.  Among other nice touches, there is the above-par dedication and friendliness of the staff. (Some waiters will sit down next to your table to take your order. This is oddly pleasant and does not put a dent in their professionalism; it gives the sense that they are willing to discuss your tastes and help you make the best possible selection.) The billing is a no-frills affair where you just get up and see the cashier once you're done comparing the paintings. Cool.  To sum it up, while it might not deserve an absolute must-see recommendation, Ma-Am-M Bolduc is a satisfying and agreeable piece of Québécois and especially Plateau culture. Check it out next time you crave a bison burger."}
{"text":"Finally tried the brunch hoping to reverse our lacklustre dinner experience. Well, the service was faster this time but the food was a disappointment.  One bland, dry, uninspired omelette (how does a restaurant screw this up?) and one serving of french toast with \"fresh fruit\". Nothing but bananas and sliced apples. It's the middle of the summer in Montreal where neighbourhood fruit stores are overflowing with cheap fresh berries, mangos, peaches, etc... and my french toast is covered in bananas and apple? Talk about dry.  A few blocks away is Pain Perdu. They know how to make an omelette!"}
{"text":"Poutine: thick and rich peppery gravy , crisp french fries and appropriate cheese. The poutine vegetarienne is excellent also, but the traditional poutine will do just fine.   This is the best poutine in Montreal, right ahead of Poutine Lafleur in Verdun. Born and raised in Quebec, whenever I visit this is the ONE poutine that I want to go to again. And always do. Darn it, now I want one and I'm 600 miles away. Please christmas break, come faster."}
{"text":"My husband and I, who usually rely heavily on Yelp while traveling, ate at this restaurant for breakfast this morning before consulting Yelp.  After many so-so experiences of restaurants in this area, we decided to eat at this little corner restaurant that we could actually see from the door of the loft we were renting.  As other reviewers have said, it's a funky little 'shabby chic' place - colorful outside with funky sign - that from the outside is unclear if they are just a coffee shop or a restaurant.  I'm happy to say we found a great neighborhood go-to.  The menu is large and looks like a scrapbook.. artsy and fun, definitely not typical, so it gave the place some flair and took us a bit to search in making a decision.  I had their Eggs Benedict (prepared perfectly with just runny egg yokes and smoked ham) and my husband had their Ham & Cheese Crepe... both came with fresh fruit and coffee.  Mine came with cut & seasoned potatoes that were excellent, proof as my husband kept sneaking mine from my plate.  Food was excellent, coffee was strong and good.  Service was nice and fast.  There is indoor (air conditioned which was nice on our very hot morning) and outdoor seating.  Small and cozy (not for big groups, but I'd say groups of 6 or less are fine).  We are planning to go back for lunch and dinner during our stay... and next time will bring our teenagers as I think they will love it.  Prices are reasonable - especially for breakfast as our meal cost under $25 for both of us."}
{"text":"Oeufs trop cuits, patates ordinaires, service lent, décor correct mais sans plus. J'ai été déçu de mon brunch. Il y a de bonnes adresses à Montréal pour la même brochette de prix, gâtez vous avec un vrai brunch ailleurs"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I only have 3 nights in Montreal and one of the things on her must get list was Poutine. Well it was between this place and Resto La Banquise, and this spot won the coin toss.    As spoken by other yelpers, let me re-iterate some key points. The menu is quite possibly one of the most colorful hand made works of art that doubles as a menu. The interior is similarly decorated as well.  You would never think that a place like this existed in such a location, but drive through a residential part of town, and then boom, there it is just sitting on the corner.  Server was friendly and offered us a selection of their beers on tap and information on what they had for the evening. Eventually my fiancee settled on being a traditionalist with the standard grand Regulaire, while I went the man route and got the  grand Bourguignonne, although I had them leave out the mushrooms. Pics were taken of both dishes and just staring at these took a year off our lives.  Mine could best be described as meat on a plate with starch under it.  The gravy was excellent and seasoning of the beef was tasty. Since I am not Canadian, I cannot say whether the cheese \"squeaked\" or not so I deferred to my fiancee who says \"It didn't squeak but it was still fresh\" you purists apparently will understand that..  She enjoyed her traditional poutine, however felt that the fries could have been a little less greasy, more cheese on the plate, and that the gravy was perfect. Definitely one of her top 3 poutines shes had so far to date."}
{"text":"Tuesday Noon, coming to Maamm Bolduc to seat ourselves in the back. There was no Lines to wait, just walk in and there were 2-3 Tables open. Maamm Bolduc has this trippy antique-ish eclectic vibe that sets itself apart. We took a long while browsing through the equally trippy extensive Menu.  As the solo Waiter scurries about multi-tasking but leaves Customers waiting. The lone Fry Cook mans the Kitchen back and forth occasionally takes a sip. Lack of staffing that leads to a subpar Meal, I wonder how they handle Weekends.  Clear sight of the Kitchen, I notice a completed Crepe is taken out of the Fridge. Placed on the Flat-top to be warmed up while my Burger Patty is on the grill. Cook goes into the Walk-in Freezer to grab some Generic Bun to be reheated. He's going at a decent pace and the Food arrives at the pass in reasonable time.  We sit there looking at the pass fill with Plates while the Waiter continues to scurry. This could be the process where my side-order regular Poutine's destiny was sealed. As we recieve our dishes, I know my Friend's ASSEMBLED Breakfast is doomed. It's a Breakfast that can be made at Home with some assembly-required.  As for the side-order regular Poutine...  It's the soggy Fries that really made this fail. These Fries were skin-on and plenty of it. Every bite was basically eating Potato Skin. The Burger was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Best poutine to date for me!  I only get to have it once per year, but this was great!  There are a number to chiose from...not as many as other poutine restaurants but plenty to satisfy!    Crisp fries, thick sauce, slightly squeaky cheese (indicates freshness) and great beer on tap!  Go ahead order the large you'll wish you would have if not!"}
{"text":"Si vous passez à côté à l'heure du lunch, autant s'y arrêter, mais pas de quoi faire le détour exprès pour y venir manger. Très bon burger du mois (veau haché, bacon et bleu), et les frites sauce psyché sont top."}
{"text":"Nous avons découvert ce restaurant vendredi et ça a été une bonne surprise. La terrasse est top, le menu est varié et le service est bon!  J'ai pris un burger végé, le Sans- remord qui était excellent. Les autres ont pris la poutine trois fromages (chèvre, régulier et bleu) , c'est pour eux la meilleure poutine! On y retournera c'est certain!"}
{"text":"The poutines were very delicious at this location. Super savoury and scrumptious. Tired four types of poutines but the Italienne was the best in my opinion.  The blue cheese one was somewhat strong but still great. The service however is subpar but the food makes up for it.  Highly recommended.  The parking is difficult so be prepared to look around."}
{"text":"The staff was efficient, and we were seated and served quickly even though it was crowded. The food was good, but nothing I could make by myself. It is a great place to go eat with friends when hangover!"}
{"text":"Slow service Owner has an attitude... I'm here to eat and have a good time and it wasn't the casr"}
{"text":"The gravy here is the balls!   Let me lay it out for you, the basic poutine has 3 ingrediends: fries, gravy, cheese.   Fries can be thick/thin, crispy or soggy.   Cheese can be sqeeky and fresh/or not, and applied in various amounts.  BUT, the secret ... the real magic ... that's in the gravy baby.  Ma-am-m Bolduc's gravy is meaty, peppery, and full of wonderful.  This little resto is tucked away on a quiet street, and has an enjoyable front patio for good weather (pitchers of beer are a plus).  I found the servers to be friendly and laid back.  Overall, my favorite place for poutine in Montreal."}
{"text":"If the crowds in a place indicate its awesomeness - Ma-am-m Bolduc's wins hands-down.  Planning on poutine, i was completely unprepared for the extensive breakfast menu which will have me returning on another Sunday for brunch.  Thoughts on the Bourguignonne poutine - more cheese please. The gravy and fries are perfect, but poutine needs curd cheese in copious amounts."}
{"text":"I went  there to eat some veggie dog and fries and I was extremely dissapointed. The service took quite a while and all I got was old barely warm fries, and the hot dog were uneatable."}
{"text":"We drove here particularly for the poutine, as we had heard it was one of the best in Montreal.  The place is small and colorfully decorated, and it feels cozy and warm, situated on a random street corner.  The servers are usually kind of hanging out behind the counter, and it's a very casual spot.  There's a nice variety of poutines to choose one, and we went with the traditional one.  The curds melted nicely, and the gravy was flavorful and beefy, but I wasn't such a fan of the fries.   The best part was probably the gravy, as it tasted rich and as if it'd been stewing for hours.  They weren't crisp enough to stand up to the sauce, and there wasn't enough cheese, in my opinion.   Unfortunately, there should be more to the poutine than just the gravy.  The preparation of the fries themselves and the lack of cheese was disappointing."}
{"text":"En voyage à Montréal, je cherchais une table pas trop excessif mais sympa avec de quoi manger à la façon québécoise !  On m'a donné cette adresse et la personne ne s'est pas trompé. Beaucoup de choses qui donnent envie : burgers, omelettes, assiettes, poutines... J'ai choisi l'assiette lendemain de veille avec du bacon, saucisses, des oeufs (choisissez votre cuisson : plat, mollet, brouillés...), des tranches de pain, des fruits...une bonne grosse assiette qui rempli bien le ventre. J'ai pris une bière avec ça (locale). Pour moins de 18$ Taxes comprises c'est plutôt bon !  L'endroit est sympathique et les serveurs/gérants assez cool !   Bien sûr étant française je n'ai pas trop de comparaison avec plusieurs brunch mais celui-ci m'a suffit et c'était top !  je recommande !"}
{"text":"Franchement l'un des endroits le plus convivial pour déjeuner. Bon prix, service chaleureux et excellente bouffe."}
{"text":"My Poutine travels continued through Montreal with my visit to Maamm Bolduc was pretty damn cool.   First off, this is not a place you wander into. No, it is a place you must enter with thought and care. They have several styles and to just willy-nilly pick one is a disgrace to a true Poutine eater! No, make plans and know your pallette.   I had the Poutine Bourguignonne with a Coke. The stuff was amazing. The curds melted so perfectly and the gravy was incredible. I was on my 5 or 6th poutine of my adventure and this was a real highlight.   The best part was the onions. They were crispy and delicious and the perfect counter-point. Not the best fries of the challenge, but possibly the best over-all."}
{"text":"C'est vrai que l'endroit est peut-être un peu victime de sa popularité, et je fais partie des gens qui trouvent aberrant d'attendre en ligne pour manger des oeufs ou une poutine.  Donc, même si c'est à côté de chez moi, je mets rarement les pieds chez MA-Am-M Bolduc.  Par contre, il faut admettre que la poutine est vraiment délicieuse, les frites maison sont cuites à la perfection, même au plus fort de l'achalandage, les assiettes sont copieuses à souhait (trop, en fait, mais ce n'est pas vraiment un défaut, non?). Ce qui serait bien, ce serait peut-être d'ajouter un \"peu\" de verdure à leur menu.  La dernière fois où j'y suis allé, j'ai décidé d'essayer le fish and chips maison.  C'était croustillant à souhait, les filets étaient bon, les frites aussi, mais une petit salade pour accompagner toute cette panure aurait été apprécié... Au lieu de quoi, on servait l'assiette avec des onion rings!  Tout était délcieux, mais tant de panure! Ça en venait un peu écoeurant, et je n'ai pas pu terminer mon assiette, loin s'en faut... J'aurais tué pour un bout de iceberg!"}
{"text":"Petit déjeuner gargantuesque !  Les portions sont très généreuses, tout est frais, et même si l'endroit peut être rempli (prévoyez une file d'attente pour un brunch) tout sent le fait maison.  Apparemment la poutine est très bonne, je me dois donc d'essayer un jour.  Je me suis contenté cette fois du pain doré avec pommes et cannelle, accompagné de fruits et sirop d'érable (of course) Absolument délicieux, des pommes craquantes/fondantes, le parfait juste milieu !  Will go again !"}
{"text":"Outstanding poutine and burgers here, and the place has many breakfast and lunch options (eggs, omelettes, crepes, French toast, bagels, salads, desserts). The vibe is funky. The staff is friendly. The clientele is hip. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ok, there's things to improve about this restaurant, but I liked it overall. The service is slow (I don't think this counts as fast food), and the food might not please everyone (We ordered blue cheese poutine, which I liked a lot, but none of my friends did).  Pretty impressive effort to make all those colorful menu and decor, which I liked as much as the several poutine we had. Funny story: I went there and our table broke in half. There was more laugh than hurt that night."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch with a couple of friends and it was surprisingly a hit! The menu is really hard to read, since it looks like it was made by children, so it kind a took all of us a really hard to go through the menu and decide what we wanted. My three friends opted for a breakfast plate that included your eggs done your way, sausage, bacon, french toast, crepe, toast, ham, fruits, potatoes and maple syrup - sounds a lot right? It was perfection! It had a little of every thing and hit all the spots right. The potatoes were amazing, and the ham is legit. All of us don't really care for ham but this was ham done right. I got the breakfast club sandwich which was your regular club but with ham, and sides of potatoes and fruit - it was stellar!  We all walked out content, satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe. Portions copieuses. Menu brunch varié. Service relativement rapide et souriant. Prix raisonnables. Je suis venu ici avec un groupe de 8 personnes un dimanche matin et l'espace qu'on nous a donné suite à notre réservation était limites. Faut préciser que l'endroit est relativement petit, ce qui est un charmant défaut. Dans l'ensemble, le groupe était satisfait. Le décor style brocante et la petite terrasse à l'avant ajoutent à l'ambiance un peu hipster de l'endroit. Peut-être un bon endroit pour un premier rendez-vous si vous désirez un resto cool et relax. Mais si vous cherchez à impressionner une mademoiselle aux goûts dispendieux, alors vaut mieux orienter son choix ailleurs. En général, c'est très bien. Je recommande."}
{"text":"We came to test the poutines before our cousins from France came. They read about it on a blog or something and as an avid poutine lover, I approve of this place. The gravy has texture and a lot of taste. The red wine gravy was my favorite of all red wine gravy I've tried until now. The fries were the perfect mix between the thick and crispy types. Cheese were a bit subpar, but the whole experience was very enjoyable. Nice staff as well!"}
{"text":"Had another visit here.   Food was okay, but the service was beyond terrible. Waitress took our order, didn't bring us our food, after ages another waiter brought us the food, waitress didn't come back to check on us at all, the order was wrong, no offers for coffee, no cheque, had to track her down to pay, and she argued with us about the order being wrong.   Decent place ruined by terrible service."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés un dimanche matin avec mes deux collocs. La place est petite mais confortable . L'ambiance est cosy parfaite pour un dimanche matin. Mes collocs ont pris des formules oeufs et bacons , c'était bon et copieux. Pour ma part je n' ai pas été déçu en prenant les pomme de terre en robe de chambre. Les assiettes étant agrémenté de toasts et de fruits frais , tout cela pour moins de 15 dollars . Que demander de mieux? C'était bon et copieux avec un bon service. On y reviendra ."}
{"text":"After hearing some rave reviews of this place, my spouse and I decided to try it out .  The location was on a quiet neighborhood right on the corner so it wouldn't be hard to miss.  Decor is funky and retro with bright colors and art drawings on the wall.  The menu was rather large with breakfast, burgers, crepes, etc..but I was a bit disappointed with the limited choices of poutines (only 5) .  I opt for the large regular poutine (7.99).  The service was good and quick it was 4pm and there was only 1-2 tables.  When the poutine came out, it looked good.  Upon tasting it the sauce was not very hot which I had liked it to be and the fries were a bit soft on the outside (I would have preferred it a bit crispier).   The dark fries might be because they have to change the oil (like some reviewers mentioned).  The cheese curd didn't look too fresh as it was pale in color and not the sharp white that you would normally see if they were fresh.  The curd didn't squeak but was rather a bit melted.  Overall, it was m'eh for me my spouse was disappointed however.   It could be an off day for the chef since it was holiday time.  I would give it another try some other day but for now I'll try the other \"top poutine\" joints that  people were talking about."}
{"text":"Wow, we decided to check this place out on our last day in Montreal because of great poutine reviews from Yelp and a Montreal blogger, and had such a horrible experience.  Only one member of the staff seemed to be trying to pay attention to everyone (the restaurant was not even busy at 3 o'clock on a Monday) and made excuses that the kitchen was understaffed. They were horribly disorganized and brought complicated grilled sandwiches and eggs to people who had arrived after us, and continually ignored us.  After 40 minutes of only being served a cup of coffee and water, and being repeatedly ignored, we asked about our ONE order of poutine and were told it was coming. 20 minutes later, and having to remind the waiter we were still there, it finally arrived and the burt fries were definitely NOT worth the 1 hour wait.   The food was average but the service was horrendous. Don't waste your time or money on this place. Everyone was waiting a very long time for a mediocre meal and the whole restaurant was completely disgruntled and unsatisfied.  I have no idea what the blogger was thinking or how anyone has had a good experience at this place. If you want great poutine, check out La Banquise - the servers actually acknowledge your presence and the food is fresh and tasty.  tldr version: -1 hour wait -mediocre poutine -burnt fries -clueless staff"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and it was absolute chaos. The waiters seemed lost and their shit was totally frantic. Waited for maybe 20 minutes before getting a table, then another 15 before anyone came to serve us. After finally getting our food, it was devoured with gusto, but more due to extreme hunger pangs than an appreciation for the cuisine. Probably a decent place if it's not super busy, but definitely not worth a long wait."}
{"text":"Ma-Am-M Buldoc is the place where makeshift meets gourmet. The menu is huge, and looking through the funky thing takes forever to order. The staff was ultra-friendly and helpful, the host was seemingly up for the challenge of English speakers. That was charming.   I loved the crepes and the gravy on the poutine was my favorite of the 3 I've had in Montreal. I believe that Montrealers overdo their hamburgers, but the bun, and toppings were great on it. So was the salad. I'd love to come here again and again. It be great to even tell people you come here again and again. While not \"too cool for school\", they are definitely at a cloud level of coolness.   This was our first meal in Montreal -- our introduction couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"Maamm Bolduc est un de mes restaurants préférés quand j'ai envie de quelque chose de simple et de réconfortant. On y trouve de tout, du déjeuner jusqu'au souper: sandwich, burger, poutine, etc. Aussi, la terrasse est agréable l'été. Le service est parfois assez long, j'ai souvent l'impression que le restaurant manque de staff lors des heures de pointe. Malgré tout, le personnel est sympathique (surtout le serveur qui est là les matins de la fin de semaine!). Oh, et j'ai gardé le meilleur secret pour la fin: Maamm Bolduc sert des déjeuners toute la journée. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Finally poutine that doesnt just taste like every other poutine. That's not a bad thing but it almost made me question the \"poutine craze\" (please dont hurt me).   However, when we ordered the Bourguignonne, I HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE POUTINE FOR MEEEE. It didnt feel heavy at all (we got the large). You definitely taste that the fries are of quality, and the delicious gravy is made from legit broth (if it were canned, the gravy in the sides of the plate, hardens). The ground beef had the slightest hint of wine, and the fries-gravy-cheese curd ratio was perfect.   The overall experience of eating in this humble restaurant in a quiet neighborhood was great."}

{"text":"MA-Am-M Bolduc feels kind of like home?!   Flipping through the menu I just not sure what to order, choices too many choices. With a small establishment with 1 cook and a small kitchen, it does makes me wonder how could that be possible.  Breakfast/Brunch with eggs, bacon, crepes and french toast ($11.99) is disappointing... a lot of food, a lot of carbs... everything is luke warm. It definitely taste like and look like something I made at home. Should I be excited?  My Yelp friend's poutine and burger looks depressing... but at least it is specials for $7.95. BTW, I think he kind of like the maple syrup... when he started dipping my whole wheat toast in that... I guess he must still be hungry after he ate his food.  At least the waiter is nice, the coffee is good and the hand made scrapbook menu is cute!"}
{"text":"Le service est déficient, le verre d'eau n'est jamais arrivé, ni le ketchup pour masquer le goût infecte du pâté chinois qui était resté dans le congélateur trop longtemps, il y avait encore de la glace sur certaine parti. Même chose pour se plaindre. J'ai du me déplacer pour voir la patronne arrogante avec une attitude déplaisante. Elle m'avait répondu qu'il fallait demander un autre plat... Ben oui, c'est ça petite innocente, essaie donc d'avoir un service dans ce resto. Je n'ai rien contre les serveuses qui font un excellent boulot, cependant elles ne sont pas assez nombreuses pour répondre adéquatement aux clients. Cette boîte est ce que le capitalisme et le profit à tout prix à de plus abjectes."}
{"text":"This is probably one of our favourite places we went to during our stay in montreal... the waiters were really friendly, the food was awesome!!! How often can you find a place serves foie gras filet mignon \"burger\" (but it;s more like sandwiches since the beef wasn't grounded up, and is actually filets) with actual pieces of the foie gras instead of pate?   The pountine was really good too!! I usually dislike gravy, but man...i found their gravy very tasty! And it didn't feel heavy, relatively speaking!   The menu is huge! and they are mostly in french, so it took us a bit of time to go through it...and it did take a long time for our order to come, but the server later explained that it was because they sold the last piece of foie gras while telling us that they had one more piece left. So they had to prepare a piece fresh...  Def worth checking it out!"}
