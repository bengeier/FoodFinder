{"text":"They have excellent gyros. I've been there several times in the past year for lunch and the food and service has always been very good. Looks like a local favorite. Prices are a bargain. 

Looking forward to trying other menu items instead of the gyros which are a sure thing for me. They have a small bar which customers where enjoying each time I was there. A freindly place for a quick tasty meal. The decor is almost nonexistent but the food is good. It has an outdoor seating area for the cooler weather months."}
{"text":"The waitress today was very rude! Because I hadn't finished my outside coffee she wouldn't even say hello - how ya doing, just 'NO outside beverages'! We all left and went somewhere else! We have been coming here for several years so she knew us also! We won't be going back there!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident. twice!!!

First time i went inside one early evening just because of their great gyro deal.   GOOD FOOD and found out it was a full bar!!!! 

Next time I walked there one evening to get some food and found it was KARAOKE night, 8-10 and all the seniors make great singers.  

good prices and good food and beer"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices. Fun place to hang out and sing karaoke. The best restaurant in Sun City."}
{"text":"Really great food at a very reasonable price.  Their home made soups are the best I have ever had, and I love their gyro and falafels as well.  Their side greed salad in unreliable, large and full of great things.  I have been several times, and never have been even slightly disappointed.  The place is very comfortable and nicely done."}
{"text":"Deep fried battered fish and fries from some frozen food distributor, and not even of the Gorton's fisherman quality--air space between batter and fish and ends of pieces were devoid of fish. Portion sizes were okay, with the fries especially generous and 3 average pieces of fish. No lemon sliver and no malt vinegar (my fault for not asking for the latter, so maybe they did have it, but visits from the server were few and far between since we were seated outside and Karaoke going on inside, which also meant that we had to walk in front of performers to get to the bar to get to a server to tell her we were outside--a logistically poor and embarrassing layout for those of us not wishing to inadvertently find ourselves the center of attention.). Tartar sauce and coleslaw (okay, but why just a couple spoonfuls? Cabbage is cheap) served in little plastic containers with caps--why? It wasn't a to-go meal, so why serve my meal with throwaways esp. when the world is overrun with necessary plastic? 
I went with a coupon for $5.99 fish dinner and showed it to server upon arrival and asked if it was still good and she said yes. When I got home and put my glasses on, I found I had been charged $7.50 with the description saying \"Fish fry with coupon special.\" Guess they had upped the price since my clipped ad which didn't have a date on it, but why wasn't I told when I asked? Why was it just slipped in without an explanation? And why did it take so long for us to get our check?--I really didn't want to go back inside and walk across a performer again....
At least they had something other than Bud-light on tap, so had Amber Bock, at a small pitcher price of $4.50--good deal even though it wasn't Happy Hour, and boy could I use it!"}
{"text":"This is tucked away in a non descript strip mall and is nothing to look at. Don't bother if ambiance is what you are after. If, though, you just want a decent gyro, then check the joint out. It seemed as though they weren't selling a lot a gyros based on the slight crispiness on the edges of the meat, but it is tasty, plenty of tatziki sauce and crispy fires. All at a very reasonable price. I will stop by again when we are in the area."}
