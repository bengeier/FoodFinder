{"text":"I have been here four or five times and each time it gets a little worse.  Not the worst cafe I have been to, just nothing special.  Their sandwiches are small and the bread is not good.  The cookies are about the only thing worth going back for."}
{"text":"I work in Downtown Mesa and I am pretty much an expert on the local eateries :)   This is my fave spot. I love the sandwiches (ask for the jalape√±o cream cheese on any sandwich) and chicken dumpling soup they have sometimes kills me! So good.   If I want to splurge I get the Scotcheroo. It's huge ... Once I had one wrapped up and I ate it for four days.   I like to browse the boutique next door too, when I have time."}
{"text":"After seeing Sweet Cakes Cafe's cinnamon rolls featured on tv this morning, we thought since it's not too far from home, we'd give it a try.  Mis-take!  The very large cinnamon rolls were individually packaged in plastic tubs (not marketed fresh, as one would expect 30 minutes after opening on a Saturday morning).  Upon opening the container, the dry, doughy, day-old roll lacked a cinnamon taste and was PLASTERED by a sweet, thick powdered sugar paste.  The coffee, thankfully, was hot enough to melt it down the throat.   For the price, ($12.00 even for 2 coffees and 2 cinnamon rolls), companion and I were severely disappointed.  We will take our business elsewhere next week."}
{"text":"I had to try this place after watching TLC naming Sweet Cakes Cafe one on their Top 10 bakeries. The gooey cinnamon rolls are made the night before so they were not hot and gooey but cool alright. There was way too much icing to roll ratio. After my experience here, I will not go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"We recently placed an large cookie order with Sweet Cakes. Unfortunately, there was a mistake with the pricing. After discussing it with the owner, she completely stepped up and made things right, even at the expense of time and profits. It's awesome to see a small business care about doing what's right and taking care of their customers! Oh, and on top of that, the cookies are awesome :)"}
{"text":"I love love love sweet cakes!! Delicious cookies! I order the sugar cookies for every holiday. That being said, bad customer service. I paid the 50 cents extra to have the Easter sugar cookies wrapped in individual cellophane bags and they did a really sloppy job. Frosting was still wet, cookies were lopsided, so I recommend the cookies but don't pay the extra money for them to wrap them!"}
{"text":"Based on recommendation from an inflight magazine on Allegiant Airlines, took my visiting sister for breakfast this morning and was disappointed.  Tab for 4 people (one only had coffee) was $28.00. French toast plate was good, Mom said, but eggs were cold.  Breakfast sandwich with sausage on croissant was lukewarm and tasteless, though cook honored my request for fried egg instead of scramble,  Sister said the breakfast scramble plate was mediocre.  Service was very slow, one meal didn't come out witgh others, coffee bar was self serve.  The three meals came with chocolate chip cookie, which was excellent.  Won't come for breakfast again but  might try the bakery."}
{"text":"This place was great. I moved to AZ not long ago from hawaii and I have to say it was a great little spot. The treats and environment was great. Check it out."}
{"text":"Tis ok..reasonable food. Quality is decent"}
{"text":"Sweet Cakes has gone CASH ONLY. No checks, no plastic (that applies to both debit & credit cards). This happened on Feb 1, 2011.  Food was great as always. We all opted for breakfast. They don't tell you that if you choose toast instead of waffles that you get more meat, and more hash browns. That left some at the table a little miffed. The hash browns are just the supermarket patties, but I love 'em. Sure, I would have liked fresh hash browns more, but they were plenty good. I wasn't a fan of their nine grain bread. Should have opted for the honey whole wheat.  Cute little place that makes you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are quite gourmet and AMAZING. Love this place. Great atmosphere, and friendly staff, not to mention all their food and sweets are to die for. We got our wedding cake here and the experience was so much fun."}
{"text":"Great salads and cookies, prices are fair. The place could stand a bit of a makeover, and they don't stay open very late but the staff is friendly. Can't wait to try more dessert items!"}
{"text":"Yum! Best baked goodies, awesome sandwiches & soup! My favorite Downtown Mesa lunch spot! Always friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"Okay so the cookies and pastries are awesome, but don't bother with the food. It is like all the other busy restaurants in Mesa, just average. The good restaurants close and the tasteless, mediocre restaurants thrive. If you are going to go there, eat lunch first at Los Dos Melinos and then splurge on their cookies and pastries."}
{"text":"Cute, cute, cute!  Sweet Cakes Cafe is an adorable cafe that will make you feel like you've just lost yourself in Paris.  Aside from how stinkin' cute the place is the food is amazingly wonderful too!  I had an enormous side salad,  half of a sandwich, and a divine chocolate chip cookie and left feeling Thanksgiving full.  In all fairness I should admit that my friend and I  ate a few bites of a peanut butter cookie and a sugar cookie as an appetizer but we each really had to take some of our cookie home.  Put Sweet Cakes on your to do list!"}
{"text":"Got a variety of cookies to bring to a meeting, all were great, but the butterscotch was everyone's fave!"}
{"text":"I don't normally get very excited about a turkey sandwich, but Oh my Goodness, this was one of the best turkey sandwiches I've ever had! I was staying nearby for a conference and wanted to get away from the hotel for a quick bite. The turkey sandwich with avocado and sprouts on sourdough was solid. I got one of the monster-sized cookies to go (peanut butter M&M) which ended up being enough to snack on for the rest of the day. Great lunch spot, would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place got a lot of kudos from being on a Food network show about the sweets at this restaurant. I have been there off and on for last couple of years and it seems each time gets worse.  They have since made restaurant smaller which ruined the appeal of eating there. The staff is super unfriendly unless they know you. The so called great sweets are really on the decline. The last time I asked for an oatmeal raisin cookie and got the wrong cooking when I got home. It also was old and crusty hard. Also, the cookies are in baskets in open where flies can land on them. I have seen this ! Yes they have some decent sandwiches but overpriced. The last french dip I got was pathetic with small portion of beef. This place is going on old reputation only and not improving. I wish it did cause they had a good thing going. But not now."}
{"text":"The cookies are HUGE and the sandwiches are tasty!! We've stopped in several times and they never disappoint. If you're there on a Friday or Saturday evening, you can catch Myke's Pizza in action! It's a small little \"pop-up\" that operates out of their front patio...KUDOS to Sweet Cake's for helping another person achieve their dream of owning a small business"}
{"text":"I came in early and the staff was so friendly and helpful.   They even made me coffee!!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Myself, the wife and the kids rolled in here on Saturday and walked out with some of the best cookies and treats we have ever eaten. We also brought home a cinnamon roll that was just awesome"}
{"text":"Oh wow this place is awesome!  I love everything about it!  The other day after a long day at work I got there at closing time (thinking it would still be open).  I tried the door and it was locked and saw the chairs were all set up on the tables etc.  I was so sad and started to walk away and a guy there came out and asked me to come in.  He said they had only just closed so they were still working on putting the food away and would make me something first.  It was so sweet and after a long day of work it just made my day!  Their food is so yummy too and all the people that work there have always been so sweet."}
{"text":"My toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats. Prior to that it was overpriced and underwhelming. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and unfortunately not impressed. They only take cash, service is not especially friendly or helpful, and they are kind of over-priced. Tried several of the baked items and was somewhat underwhelmed- honestly though that may be because I saw them on a TV show and had high expectations- but I have given this place more than just one shot. Bottom line, they are okay but not great and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are average. Had a BLT with avo. Very two small slithers of avo. I expect more for a $7.50 sandwich.  Cookies good. Not much to right home about."}
{"text":"Cookies are good but just the cookies. I got a sandwich here and lets just say i could've made that sandwich at home"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. Cookies are kind of dry. Decent service."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! They have the best sugar cookies I have ever hard. Any time we are in the area this is where we go!"}
{"text":"Caramel. Pecan. Roll. There's really nothing else to say. But Yelp is making me type more before it will post. Sooo. Caramel. Pecan. Roll."}
{"text":"I've been here and it's amazing they've got the best chocolate chip cookies and amazing lemonade I also love that it is sharing a wall and door to a cute boutique so I can shop and get a snack !!!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to get there after my sister recently showed me the youtube video of the place from the bit done on TLC.  Drove from N. Scottsdale and wanted it to be my weekend stop from now on.  Well, I can't even find the words to express my disappointment.  Walked in an hour after it opened today to find only one table with quests and no one working behind the counter.  Waited a few minutes until I noticed the bell on the counter.  Rang the bell and someone appeared a minute later.  I couldn't find the shelves of fresh baked brownies and cinnamon rolls that were obviously staged for the show.  What I found instead were brownies individually wrapped in plastic wrap and cookies that looked like my 5 year old made them last week.  No trays of cinnamon rolls to be found.  Instead there was a cart to the side of the counter that had individually packaged rolls in plastic containers.  I asked if they were fresh and I was told they were made last night.  I asked to have one warmed.  I gave it the good old try and after two bites decided it wasn't worth the calories.  Where was the cinnamon?  Where was the brown sugar?  Where was any taste at all? Tried the brownie featured on the show and another cake, Gooey Cake, and again, one big fat disappointment.  Also got a snicker doodle and another cookie and again, no taste.  Not worth it!  It certainly is not the place featured on the show!  Oh, and on the show they talked about the pies.  Not one in the place! It didn't even smell good like a bakery should."}
{"text":"The thing I like about Sweetcakes is that whether I want a meal, or just a treat- it's going to be great regardless. I love their sandwiches, and obviously their cookies are the best. Their cookies are particularly great to order in large batches for special occasions. Leaves people really impressed."}
{"text":"Best cookie stop in town! I recommend the Snickerdoodle or frosted sugar cookie."}
{"text":"Sweet Cakes, or \"that Mormon place,\" as many of my fellow workers in downtown Mesa call it, is a good value, and has excellent baked goods. Why \"that Mormon place\"? Well, sometimes they have a basket with a sign that says, \"Free gifts,\" and you get all excited, thinking maybe it is full of cookies or pens or something -- but then you realize it's full of free Books of Mormon.  On the upside? Excellent cookies and brownies. It's only a lunchtime place, and the best value is a soup/salad/half sandwich combo, which comes with a pickle spear and a cookie. It costs about $6.50. The soups are really heavy - I haven't even finished my cups of them when I've eaten there. And, while you won't find any of your trendy pesto-fresh basil - buffalo mozzarella-gruyere-proscuitto kind of stuff here, you will find nice, home-baked breads and simple veggie, turkey and french dip sandwiches. Get the honey wheat bread, it's the best. It's often pretty crowded with the Mesa/Gilbert Stay-at-home-mom crowd, so it can be hard to grab a seat, but the tables clear out pretty quickly. Make sure you grab a big cookie to take with you."}
{"text":"I ordered ordered a turkey sandwhich along with a gooey cake. The sandwhich was pretty dry and the turkey tasted as if it was from a \"can\" . The cake was dry and tasted like a cookie. Very dry and texture was crummy. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome Cookies!  They are opening a yogurt shop in the space next door so i cannot wait for the 5 layer brownie smashed down with a layer of frozen goodness.  Definitely stop in there and test out one of those tire sized Carmel Pecan Cinnamon rolls"}
{"text":"The strawberry banana orange nonfat vanilla froyo was amazing. The cookies are delicious and not very good for you. But of course, they are tasty and satisfy the most demanding sweet tooth. Everything else seemed overpriced, but that is the requisite for supporting local businesses. The environment is bright, comfortable, and there is much room to sit. Friendly staff. Buy 2 get 1 free cookies on Saturday."}
{"text":"Yeah the lunch was good...but woah...those freakin cookies were out of this world (after I scratched off the layer of icing on the sugar cookie).  I had a tasty french dip, my hubby had another sandwich (can't remember) and my daughter had a cheesy grilled cheese.  She liked the pickle the best though.  I will say the next best thing to those cookies was the tomato bisque soup.  I will definitely stop in again for that!  Cute little (no actually big) ambience and outside seating for those great sunny days.  It was also good for kids as you know all Mormon places would be but ours was the only little one in the shop."}
{"text":"Loved it! We took our little boys to Sweet Cakes before an afternoon at the Mesa Temple and it was yummy!   The offer a kids meal and our boys ordered grilled cheese sandwiches. Nothing out of the ordinary but perfect for a 4 year old and a 7 year old. My husband had a ham and swiss melt that he said was good and I really enjoyed the turkey, avocado, and sprout sandwich I ordered.   I am thinking this is more of a ladies lunch place. I liked the fact that the sandwich was not so big that you didn't wonder how you would even be able to take a bite but my husband left saying he was still hungry.   Sandwiches come with a chocolate chip cookie that is the main reason for the 5 stars. I am a picky person about my chocolate chip cookies and this was the best one I have ever had. EVER.   We also got some baked goods. Sugar cookies, brownies, and a giant Oreo cookie...all of which were delicious!"}
{"text":"Always love stopping here when in the area. Cinnamon rolls are super delicious and the Carmel Pecan roll is just perfection! From addictive cookies, filling  sandwiches to so much more, you won't be disappointed when stopping here!!"}
{"text":"Very poor....went there for coffee and a roll....Both were terrible.....too much talking between employees.....Cold environment.....will not go back...."}
{"text":"All the cookies and pastries are great,the owner has a sourpuss look on her face and takes her sweet time even when you ring the bell, though her hired staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Bought $9 worth baked goods then find out later that they have a punch card. Girl that waited on me didnt say a word about it. The chocolate cream is very good. I just wish i could find one where u taste more of the chocolate and less of the sugary cream. Cookie is soft, as it should be, generous amount of cream. Out of the cookies, the sugar is my favorite. I was really looking forward to the ginger which has very nice flavorbut i dont like the texture. Too chewy and i dont mean soft. Soft is good and so is crispy but these are a workout for the jaw. Last is the pecan choco chip. I like the proportion of nuts and chips. Might be a bit rich for some but it tastes wonderful. $9 for all of that. The cookies are quite large."}
{"text":"We have been going to sweet cakes for years. The food is yummy and the cookies and bars are to die for! Cute decor and the owners are friendly and personable. They opened the other side up about a year or so ago and it serves yummy ice cream and treats. We love sweet cakes!"}
{"text":"Well... The food here is good.  I like the chicken quesadilla for sure.  But the real reason to go to this place is the cookies!  The best cookie ever made is sold here : an oatmeal butterscotch chip masterpiece.  Also--an white chocolate chip pecan craisin cookie.  a legendary gingersnap--and I hate gingersnaps.  lemon bars!  five layer brownies!  chocolate creme cookies!  pumpkin bars which my god are ridiculously good.  it's very mesa-y and homey (not like hardcore homey, come on now) and the decor is countryish.  but if you want good cookies/desserts and decent food, go there.  one more thing--they have this frosted sugar cookie which everyone claims is the best thing in the whole place.  lofty assertion, indeed.  you should make your own decision..."}
{"text":"I almost forgot about this place. I'm convinced they put lard in their sandwiches, but the cookies are great!!! When I worked at Mesa Arts Center we used to go there and everyone is friendly. Def do the take out thing, unless you REALLY like kids. A whole lotta kids."}
{"text":"Too bad the construction along Main Street in Mesa can inhibit people from coming in!  I had their, I believe it was called, green chili chicken sandwhich. It was so good. Chicken, green chili, pepperjack (?) on ciabatta. I'd definitely reccomend that.   Also, I had the butterscotch cookie. The cashier warned me it was very sweet, and it really was. I could only take a few bites before I put the rest away for later. Maybe that's a good thing! That cookie was huge!   It's a nice little mom and pop place. It was busy when I went. The people who worked there were very nice and friendly.   It's just a shame that it's hard to get to because of the construction. If I hadn't been with a colleague who'd been there before who said it was really good, I would have driven past it because parking was far from the place.   But good find! It was on one of those TLC shows too.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going here for lunch. I had a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich on Jalapeno Cheese Bread and finished with some frozen yogurt topped with pieces of their delicious cookies. Both were delicious and the Froyo with Cookie pieces was a great finish. Its just a standard, small cafe, but the employees here have been extremely nice and friendly every single time I have gone. I have yet to have a bad experience. The price isn't terribly high, I would say on par with Paradise Bakery and the likes. They are known for their baked goods, but you should definitely try a sandwich on one of their specialty breads (like the Jalapeno Cheese that I mentioned above). Don't be deterred by the possibly long line at lunch time, it moves very quickly (at least it has everytime I have been in) and the sandwiches are usually brought to you about 5 minutes after you order. I would definitely recommend this to others as a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, great decor! Must go! 4.50 for breakfast croissant sandwich. So delicious and worth it..."}
{"text":"I finally made it to sweet cakes. i had my nieces with me and i like to buy their love, so what better way to buy love than with cookies?!?    you can probably buy my love with cookies, too. i love cookies.   i love cookies so much that i will even fall for the 'sugar free' gimmick pillsbury cookie dough when im dieting. everytime. i think- 'maybe i didn't make them right last time, i should try it again.' ya, it's really hard to make slice and bake cookies.... and by 'slice' i mean 'already cut into perfect round cookie dough bits that just need to be placed on a cookie sheet'. and for the record, the sugar free cookies taste like BBQ'ed plastic.  i also love cookies so much that i will go out to dinner with friends to oreganos. not a fan of oreganos, but i will replace dinner with a pizookie no problem. because what's better than a half raw piping hot fresh cookie?   nothing. which is why we took home a tub of  sweet cakes chocolate chip cookie dough and made the best freakin cookies. only after eating a scoop of raw cookie dough first, of course.   the raw cookie dough is some of the best. if you go the tub route be sure to save some cookie dough for raw eating pleasure.  the cooked cookies were amazing and the tub will last me for far too long- but on second thought, there is no such thing as too long when it is regarding cookies.   there are so many things i want to do with that tub of delightful cookie dough(homemade vanilla ice cream with cookie dough pieces anyone?). you need to experience this for yourself."}
{"text":"This was a trendy lil cafe that my friend recommended us trying for their desserts.  We actually got to try many items: the lemon bar to the brownie to the cinnamon roll.  All 3 of us agreed that the cinnamon roll was the best followed by the brownie."}
{"text":"I have walked by this caf√© a thousand times the last few years and always seem to be too busy to stop in, what a mistake.  All the wonderful meals I could have had and yummy bakery.  Open for lunch this small  bright and airy bakery was crowded to the max.  When it was finally my turn to order the wait staff was charming. She helped me picked out a sandwich she thought I would like. And the sandwich was a delight.  Of course I had to get some cookies to take home but they never made it that far they were out of this world.  Would I go back? Of course!!!   I think I found another gem close by in my ."}
{"text":"I love the food here. They call me the cookie monster, so this place is an immediate fit for me with amazing cookies (best I have had in AZ). Their sandwiches and bread bowl soups are also awesome. The only thing I don't like is that they don't accept credit card anymore. In this age, I rarely carry cash, but I understand why they made the switch (3 - 5% charge for them.)"}
{"text":"I go here for the COOKIES!!! The sandwichs and soups are okay, but the draw is the cookies!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast to find out they don't have breakfast anymore. Sweets in the morning make me sick so I had to go somewhere else. Might go back just for coffee or lunch sometime. But they only have breakfast if you like cookies and sweet rolls in the morning."}
{"text":"Holy @@#$*&!!!  Get the sweet cake for sure.  The brownies were really good too!  BTW if they are closed and you still want sweets, go next door to the frozen yogurt shop and they sell the goods after hours!  I wouldn't come here for lunch...the sandwiches look plain, nothing unique."}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of this small sandwich shop.  Expect to pay around $7.50 per meal, which isn't bad, but maybe a little too much for the simple sandwiches.  The sandwiches are great, don't get me wrong, but it's nothing I can't whip up on my own at home with some better-than-Walmart groceries.  Good, fun, clean place in a nice location.  It's worth stopping by if you're in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"I'm secure enough in my masculinity to unequivocally endorse this place.  Look past the shabby chic decor and the gossiping grandmas and you will find some great sandwiches and the best sugar cookie I've had in Phoenix.    A great meal in a great part of Mesa.  Now if only we could get more activity and life in that neck of the woods."}
{"text":"It's sad the stunt y'all pulled this evening. I have been buying your cookies and taking them to my clients because you are on my route to PHX.(4 dozens a week) Tonight I came to your establishment at 7:54pm with my wife to purchase some dessert after dinner. We walk in to find nothing on the shelf and a lackadaisical staff not evening caring that we are there. As we ask where the cookies are the response is, \"well we close in like 5 minutes so we boxed everything up\". What a worthless establishment and staff. Close your frickin shop at 7:30 then!! This place and staff will no longer be getting my business. We went to Worth Take Away(so much better anyways and open till 9pm!) and got the famous and delicious banana pudding. Staff is amazing at Worth Take Away too. I recommend Joey's PSG over this, hell even subways staff is better. The place is turning into a boutique and food and dessert has been suffering. No longer a go to spot for me or my entourage."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the baked treats here, but don't worry I'll be back soon to try out everything else on the menu too! But let's start with the sweets. What do I think? Well let me quote the famous yelper Sarah G...holy shit!   First off, the store itself is adorable. It reminds me of a neighborhood family cafe in a small town. It's wholesome, clean, the staff is friendly and there's plenty of seating all around. I saw a boy comfortably doing some work in one corner and a group of chatty friends having fun in another corner. The baked goods are prominently displayed and it's hard not to leave with some...especially since they conveniently had a whole plate full of cookie samples! My waistline hates me but I'll deal with it later. It was well worth it!   The cookies are reasonably priced for their size. They are $1.50 and about the size of small clock. They had oatmeal chocolate chip, sugar cookies with frosting on top, peanut butter M & M, oatmeal toffee, chocolate chip and many many more. Since I was in the area, I had to stock up for the weekend, so I left with three different kinds. I think my favorite is the sugar because of the yummy frosting and then secondly, I like the simple yet succulent chocolate chip. I will definitely be sharing with my bf otherwise I will be rolling down the aisle at my friend's wedding in a couple weeks!  As I was about to walk out with my cookies, I was handed a brownie for the road. I couldn't say no and I am so happy I didn't! Before I was even 2 miles away, I opened the wrapping and took a little bite. You try having one of these little guys next to you without your will power taking a nap so you can take a bite!  The slices of heaven known as the brownies are squishy because they are topped with ooey gooey chocolate. The ooey gooey chocolate is surrounded by marshmallows, cream cheese, chocolate and a secret sauce. I mean, it's got to be a secret sauce because they are delicious. They are rich, cream, chewy, delicious....etc etc etc. I see why"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a great sandwich here once again. I love their butterscotch cookies! Typically super friendly service. I always feel like the dining area is a little messy (not dirty, just disheveled) They need to send someone out more often to make sure it looks neat and tidy."}
{"text":"Cool upscale country upscale atmosphere inside, friendly staff.  I had the pumpkin cake and the cake part of it was really good but there was probably 4 to 5 times too much extremely rich frosting, I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"The best part of my Thanksgiving dinner by far was sweet cakes pecan pie. I don't know how much my wife paid for it and I don't care.  It was worth every cent. I've eaten lots of pecan pie in my life but never the way this was presented. Its like caramelized pecan crumble is on the top of the pie. My mouth is watering just talking about it. If you like pecan pie you have to try it you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a cute place and it's decorated to feel nice and homey. It achieves that. But I'm not there for the ambience, the sandwiches or the drinks - they have Pepsi on tap. SCORE for them. But that's not what I'm here to write about.  The cookies. That's what you come to this place for - the cookies. That's why I'm writing about them, too.  If you bake them, they will come.  When I used to go to the Mesa Arts Center to do work on my jewelry, I'd always have an extra $2 in my pocket for the sugar cookie. I would have one, but it was seriously my crack cocaine. I felt like one was never enough.  I've tasted all their cookies and frankly, they're honorable mentions when you pit them against the good god almighty sugar cookie they make.  Sugar cookie, with that frosting on top...no other cookie out there can compare. It is the one thing that got me hooked on trying to replicate it. I didn't want my husband to know I had spent about $10 a week on cookies since I used to be at the Mesa Arts Center 4-5 days a week.  Eventually, my sugar cookie habit was discovered. An intervention ensued. We won't talk about that. I know it came from a good place by my husband and well meaning friends, but I still harbor a slight bitterness towards them...Since then, hubby's learned to sleep with one eye open.  Ok, putting their sugar cookie addiction aside, I've also had their food. It's nice, but nothing I'd really rave about. It's a little on the pricey side and I'd much rather go around the corner, snarf down some Taco Bell and use the extra money saved towards an extra sugar cookie. :D"}
{"text":"My family and I love Sweet Cakes- such a treasure in downtown Mesa! The food is well thought out and simply delicious. My favorites are the Turkey Delight sandwich, Cinnamon Rolls, and the Scochteroos. The cafe is cute and always very clean. I would love to see this cafe grow with a larger menu."}
{"text":"Cookies are amazing.. Their menus has changed a bit and is very limited now but the sandwiches are good."}
{"text":"A vendor two doors down suggested I try this spot for lunch.  A nice, little local establishment. I got the pepper turkey sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup.  Portions were a good size and it came with a homemade cookie.  The price was on point.  The rest of their baked goods looked awesome.  A little bit of a wait for a soup and sandwich and it's cash only but if I'm in the area, I would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of their cookies, frankly their best cookie is the one that comes free with any sandwich (it really actually is freaking Delicious!). I think my biggest beef is that their sugar cookies (those extra-soft ones with light frosting on top?) are not soft at all.  on the other hand, MY GOODNESS, their sandwiches are AMAZING. (although pricey.) Their service is great, the wait time is minimal, and it's a classy place to have lunch meetings. I highly recommend their BLT with avocado, and I highly recommend not going at noon."}
{"text":"This place has the best sugar cookies! It is a small little bakery/cafe. I normally just come for the sweets but I have eaten their sandwiches and soups too.  Their cookies are always fresh and you can request special orders for your cookie patterns. My boss would always buy special cookies for the teachers for every holiday. The employees have always been very nice and helpful. This place has been around for awhile and they have a lot of regulars who stop by. I can only go once a month because if I went more I would look like a cookie."}
{"text":"Sweet Cakes is a hidden treasure with amazing baked goods!   Their sandwiches are pretty darn good also! The best is their chicken salad sandwich! Their cookies are huge and their 5 layer brownie is to die for! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it! They are also pretty reasonable with timing in how long it takes them to prepare the food which is nice!   A must try!"}
{"text":"From the very first sugar cookie I had from this place, I was hooked. It's right by my office, which turns out to be a bad thing because I absolutely cannot pass by without going in for a cookie. And if I get myself a cookie, I have to get one for everyone in the office. And then I get yelled at because they can't resist. :)   In all seriousness though, they are the best cookies in the world! And their lunch is great as well!   If you go, check out the EDGE Boutique next door... super CUTE clothes!"}
{"text":"So my coworkers and I had decided to try this place for lunch the other day, and their sandwiches were mediocre, their 5 layer brownies were good but a bit too sweet for all 4 of us that tried it.  I also had tried the cinnamon roll which was decent as well. Personally id rather just got to cinnabon for then drive all the way out there for theirs even though theirs is Huge.  I had also ordered the sugar cookie which i was expecting to taste like those cake sugar cookies with frosting was a normal sugar cookie but with frosting. So not my cup of tea but im sure plenty of others that need a good sugar rush would enjoy this immensely."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but now, its just ok.  When I first went to sweet cakes they were awesome, great food, outdoor seating - what else could you ask for.  After a while they stopped taking credit cards (completely asinine in today's world) so I stopped going for a while.  I eventually returned when I heard that they got their act back together and were taking plastic again.  I went back and it wasn't quite as good as it once was.  They now have gotten rid of the great little ice cream shop and replaced it with a boring clothing store and changed their menu.  They used to have a great jalepeno bread that they no longer carry.  I am not sure if it was multiple changes in ownership or what but the original Sweet Cakes would have gotten a 5 star review for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat and socialize.  Every time I walk in, I'm given the greeting of the day.  The menu is very simple, healthy, and tasty. In my opinion, they are best known for their deserts.  Prices on their menu is fair and its a clean environment.  During high school I've been to a couple of local band/singers performance here, they are always fun to go to with friends.  I highly recommend to try their double chocolate brownie and their cookies.  Awesome local privately owned cafe in Mesa"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I come for the cookies--they are amazing.  I'm aware that they have other items, but it's all about the cookies.  Service is fast.  Only downside is that the parking is aweful on Main Street."}
{"text":"Holy Shit! That was the best brownie I've ever eaten!  The 5 Layer Brownie is 5 layers of Luscious Sinful Heaven! Devils food brownie base with cream cheese filling topped with chocolate chips, marshmallows and fudge OH MY! (see pics)  I also got a Sugar Cookie frosted with cream cheese and a Giant  ginger snap the size of my face, both delicious! (see pics)  Cute little cafe offering soup, Boars-Head sandwiches and a few salads, but it looks like there money  maker here is the baked treats. That's what I had and the other customers were all eating the treats too.  They have about 10 different types of cookies and 7 or 8 bars, all generously sized and reasonably priced. I can't wait to try them all.  5 stars for the brownie at least , maybe I'll try the food some time.  Stop in for your 5 layers of heaven! You'll Thank Me Later~"}
{"text":"Overpriced and bland. My $9 turkey sandwich was mostly bread. Side options are an extra charge and consist of a bag of lays potato chips, a side salad (just iceberg lettuce with dressing), or soup. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"we stopped here after a trip to the so called \"museum of natural history\" and i was only slightly impressed. on saturday's they offer a \"buy two cookies, get one free\". i had what i thought was a red velvet cupcake- it was good but definitely not red velvet. the cookies were good, but i'm not going to make a special trip to go back anytime soon.."}
{"text":"This place is great! Simple menu for lunch, but everything is good! Then, you can top off your meal with an oatmeal coconut cookie...best around. The road construction on Main stinks, but don't let that deter you, come in through the back."}
{"text":"I have 2 young toddlers and eating lunch here was very difficult. Not enough high chairs and staff and other customers seemed inpatient with my children.   Food was so so nothing to rave about. The biggest wow was the yummy cinnamon roll! Next time I'll be getting it to go and just the cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"Great cinnamon rolls. Don't know about anything else but the cinnamon rolls are very good, the ones with pecans are great too."}
{"text":"I have been to Sweetcakes several times for lunch as well as cookies. Sometimes the cookies are really good and then there are time when they are not. Definitely a lack of consistency. The last time I went I bought three cookies and a bar and I wasn't really that sad that one fell out of my stroller, I was more upset that I paid a lot for not very good cookies. I love supporting downtown, but for the price, I need a product that stands out. Everytime I have been in the customer service isn't that great as well, the people are okay. I am not sure if I will be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Decided to meet the hubby for lunch today and found this little gem near his office.  My son and I both went with the Hail Ya, turkey and avocado with bacon, jalapeno infused cream cheese, and buffalo ranch.  It was delicious! The hubby has been on a kick to find really good veggie sandwiches and Sweet Cakes did not disappoint.  I also tried the broccoli and cheese soup, which wasn't the best I've ever had, but was pretty good as well.  Will definitely return when meeting up for lunch!  And next time I need to try the cookies!!"}
{"text":"Very simple cafe serving fresh baked goods, sandwiches and soup. My wife and I stopped in with our one-year old to have a quick lunch. The owner took our order and was very nice, making sure our visit was a good one. We chatted about the iPad she used to take the order and run our credit card (using Square technology). Pretty cool to see the 21st century tech hit locally owned cafe! The inside is a little small, but very quaint.   The menu is very simple but it works- they serve Boarshead deli meats, which is a nice quality sandwich meat. I ordered the peppered turkey and my wife got the classic turkey on a croissant. The food was great- $8 per sandwich (no sides) but they did offer a lunch special of 1/2 sandwich and soup for $7. Their soups that day were chicken and wild rice, or broccoli cheese. We opted for the Lays chips since it was a little warm outside for soup. The kiddo got a grilled cheese for $4 (includes a small drink). With two fountain sodas the total came to around $26, which seemed about right for two good-sized sandwiches, two 20 oz. sodas, and 2 small bags of chips with the kid's grilled cheese. Suffice it to say, we all left full. It's a small local owned business so please visit and show the support! I believe there's breakfast options as well- we need to go back to check out and see.  There's a small patio out front that seats maybe 15 people but it's a great spot (weather permitting) to people watch along Main St. Head to Sweet Cakes if you crave homemade sandwiches made with high quality product, and a nice little \"local owned\" establishment. The place was very clean, bright, and quiet. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were exploring downtown Mesa, and we were looking for a quick, light lunch. Enter Sweet Cakes Cafe. We were pleasantly surprised that they had a small selection of salads, sandwiches, and soups, in addition to their giant cookies and sweet treats. I had their lunch special: 1/2 sandwich with soup or salad for $7.50 + tax.  All the sandwiches come with a small cookie and pickle. They only have about 10 sandwiches to choose from, and your bread options include honey wheat, white, rye, sourdough, 9 grain, or croissant. You can also add bacon or avocado to your sandwich for extra.   I had the turkey delight with no mayo and cream cheese on 9 grain.  It was a small sandwich, but surprisingly good. Fresh ingredients like sprouts and avocado, good turkey, and the 9 grain bread was perfectly toasted.  The small salad was ok. It was mainly iceberg lettuce (boo) mixed with some romaine lettuce. All in all, a satisfying meal. Good place for lunch!"}
{"text":"They make some delicious cookies and deserts.  I love Sweetcakes and occassionaly they will host local band shows there during the summer.  I"}
{"text":"I was so pleased to find this little bakery and sandwich shop close to the museum. This is the perfect place for to take the kids for lunch when we go out for a little education and adventure. The prices were fair and the service good. However the real treat was the bread. It was just so fresh and lovely. The cinnamon rolls were also quite a treat. The frosting/icing on them wasn't kill you sweet and it was light and creamy. We will definitly be back.  ***I forgot to mention the reason I took away one star had to do with the fact that they only serve turkey sandwiches. The sandwiches themselves are GREAT. I just can't stand turkey. I wish they offered an alternative such as ham."}
{"text":"Sandwiches and sweets served tout-sweet! I had actually heard of this restaurant from a show called \"Best Food Ever\" hosted by John Goodman. In the episode, John Goodman, in his deep rumbling voice, proclaims \"Go to Sweet Cakes Cafe for their BETTER THAN SEX BROWNIE\". Well with a name like that who can resist?  The cafe focuses mainly on sandwiches and sweet baked goods. A whole sandwich is $7.75 and you can get a combination lunch special which is a half sandwich and salad/soup for the same price ($7.75). I had the combo lunch (Turkey medley and garden salad with sesame vinaigrette) with the aforementioned brownie (Called the 5 layer brownie in real life). My total was around $12 with tax.  The cafe is cute with lots of small tables to accommodate the lunch crowd. My sandwich and salad were made in a few short minutes. It was a small half of a sandwich with a side salad that consisted of sliced romaine, a few pieces of chopped tomato, and a few slices of cucumber. Dressing was in a small container on the side. While the sandwich half looked tiny to me, it did taste good, with the fresh sliced turkey, light crisp bacon, and sweet cranberry sauce. The salad was also fresh but it was very basic and I couldn't really taste any sesame in the dressing, just a generic sweetness. It was super thick and concentrated so I only needed a small drizzle on the salad.   The combo lunch is served with a small chocolate chip cookie. The cookie tasted very doughy and was very light colored (No slight browning/caramelization from baking), an indication they hadn't baked the cookie for long enough. As for the BETTER THAN SEX BROWNIE, what was the verdict? Well.... I don't mean to be crude or very harsh, but let's just say the people that unofficially named this brownie should maybe talk to a sex therapist. The whipped frosting really killed it for me. I liked the fluffy light texture of it but it was so sickeningly sweet I could only take a few bites before declaring mercy on my pancreas and its insulin production for the day.  Service was very friendly and as sweet as their desserts. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with the baked goods here or the sandwiches, especially when there are other options for food in the downtown Mesa area."}
{"text":"Had the soup and sandwich combo with a BLT and chili. Yum!   The highlight though is the desserts. We got a lemon bar, brownie, sugar cookie and chocolate whoopie. Everything is made from scratch and tastes soooooo good!!!   The restaurant is small, so be prepared to wait for seating, or get cozy at a small table."}
{"text":"-Sandwiches are pricey. Nothing special.  $7.50+ (includes a pickle and small cookie.)  -Lunch lines not very organized, moved slowly.  -I would give 5-stars for the cookies, they are really GOOD!  -Beverage area is in the next room, found this confusing. Too much chit-chat among employees behind the beverage counter, instead of helping customers.  -Pretty decor. Plently of tables to eat at.  -Very friendly employees.  -Parking (1 hour) is along Main St or parking lot around the corner."}
{"text":"Let me sum up Sweet Cakes for you in two words... over rated.  My wife loves this place, and I can see why. The decor is as if the hobby lobby filled head of a molly Mormon exploded inside a hole in a wall restaurant, and the resulting mess that came out was cookies and vinyl lettering surrounded by oil paintings of merchant allies in Paris. If you're into that sort of thing, be my guest. Otherwise, the paint jobs look unprofessional (clearly no primer and sloppy lines), the design is inconsistent and the sitting bars by the windows are literally plank boards being held together by vice grips. As hard as they try to design the hell out of this place they did so by cutting corners, and it shows. Very sloppy.   That brings me to another point, in what appears to be another effort to pinch every penny, sweet cakes has made a very critical anti-consumer mistake and is now only accepting cash. They say they're \"going green\" which is bull. Getting rid of a credit card machine doesn't do anything to support sustainability, but it sure is a nice way to get people to think you're not actually screwing them when they walk inside.  All's not lost though (sarcasm), seeing as how they only accept cash now, they've conveniently provided an ATM in their shop that you can withdraw cash from, and wouldn't you know it, it's owned by sweet cakes cafe (gee, I wonder who gets a cut of that $2 atm service fee for pulling out cash, nevermind the $2 your bank will charge you in addition to the atm). It would be one thing if the owners passed on the \"burden\" of accepting debit and credit cards to the consumer by slightly raising prices (heaven forbid!), but it's a whole different thing to profit from the fact that the consumer has no choice other than cash in your establishment.   I didn't try the deli items here, but from what I saw, I'm glad I didn't. The pizza literally looked like the kind you would get from a school cafeteria lunch and the sandwiches didn't look particularly appetizing either. We did try the cookies and I have to say that I was really disappointed. They were too crunchy and hard. The snicker doodle was actually decent, but for the most part I could make better cookies than these at home. The only difference here is that they must use an ice cream scoop when baking them because they're so huge. Speaking of which, if you go on Saturday they have a \"buy 2 cookies get 1 free\" sale, and I put that in quotes, because the reality of the situation is that if you buy 4 cookies, you will not get 2 additional free. I wanted to buy 4 cookies and get 2 free because in my mind, when you say buy 2 get 1 free, unless there's a limit stated then it should extend to multiples of two, it's just common sense. But when confronted about it, the cashier claimed that it's buy 2 or more and get 1 free. That's a huge difference!! If the policy is 1 free cookie per transaction then it should be clearly stated on the sign, instead, yet again sweet cakes has shown their anti-consumer attitude by their unclear and misleading sale.   Overall, if I'm going to spend $7 on a sandwich, or $1.5 on a cookie, i'm going to do it at paradise bakery or somewhere that I don't feel like they're trying to rip me off by selling me sub par goods at higher prices. I'm all for supporting your local businesses, but when you can visit a shop once and determine that you don't even want to give it a second chance, you've messed up."}
{"text":"Was invited back by the owner to enjoy 3 cinammon rolls on the house due to them being out the last time I was there.  The lady behind the counter was very cordial and the cinammon rolls were wonderful."}
{"text":"Sadly this place did not really live up the the reviews. We went there for lunch last weekend. I had the club. Maybe the most accurate thing I can say about it is that it was just like something I would make myself at home during the week to take to work for lunch. That's not really what I'm expecting when I pay $8 for a sandwich. The cookie that came with the meal was good, if a bit hard (no paradise bakery cookie) and the frozen yogurt was good as well.  The decor was nice and the service was good. Some of the other deserts looked real good.  Unfortunately, when I spend $20 on sandwiches I expect something worth that. Not the same thing I'd get in my own kitchen for a few bucks."}
{"text":"Cold bland soup, uninspired sandwich, didn't even get to the cookie."}
{"text":"Best. Cookies. Ever.  Really, they are awesome! The staff was super friendly, great experience overall!"}
{"text":"This WAS the best bakery cafe in town. Stopped in today for some sandwiches and sweets and were blown away to see it had changed into Mezona Market. What in the actual fuck!?! So we see that they still have sweet cakes bakery in the corner so we order up an old favorite, a 5-later (better than sex) brownie and some cookies. We then headed outside away from the shitty Mezona Market to enjoy our treat and noticed the Sweet Cakes stickers on the brownie box still says cookie and gourmet sandwich shop. Bullshit! Then wait what's this, they 5-layer brownie has been changed and SUCKS! So did three of the 4 cookies we bought. So sad to see a place go from awesomeness and nationally reviewed to this garbage. Won't ever return to this business. Would have asked for our money back, but they are clearly gonna need it more than I do when their fans see this shit."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the food was tasty.  The broc n chz soup was just ok...sweets are yummy!  I'd go back..."}
{"text":"the chicken salad is so good... the 5 layer bar is excellent... the cookies are quite awesome..."}
{"text":"Sweet Cakes= Sweet stuff!    I was bored and had a craving at work after a garlicky lunch, (1:30 PM on a Tuesday) so i decided to go to Sweet Cakes and see what all the Yelpers were raging about this place.  The place was empty.. and big, im used to the tiny new york bakeries and delis.. nonetheless I tried the sugar cookie, and it is as good as they say!   I also ordered the Peanut butter cookie and the chocolate chip pecan cookies, still good... not as good as the sugar cookie... but still edible.. hey they are cookies! most cookies are edible!!!  They are pretty huge too i wld say 3-4 inches in diameter??  the sugar cookie was smaller but still on the bigger side of the average cookie..  I havent tried Jason's Deli's cookies and i will.."}
{"text":"Pecan Chicken Salad Sandwich was very tasty and the sourdough bread is really fresh. The salad dressing isn't too watery, just perfect."}
{"text":"I had been here a few years ago with some friends and I remembered how much I've liked it. Now that some time has passed by and I decided to give this a try.  I had ordered a turkey sandwich and my boyfriend had ordered the chicken fajita melt. It came with a pickle and a cookie. They were nice enough to give me a free cookie because they had a special deal if you checked in via Yelp! app on your smartphone! My boyfriend decided to get a butterscotch cookie while I got myself the peanut butter & M&Ms cookie!  This cafe seems to be more known for its sweets than sandwiches but that doesn't mean it's all bad. The fajita melt had a nice spice to it while my turkey sandwich had a lot of bean sprouts. That's probably my fault since I had forgotten to ask to take it out. Ah, well.  The cookies were pretty good - they were still pretty soft but for some reason, the cookies weren't as fresh as I hoped. While the sandwiches were good, even though I forgot to ask to take out the bean sprouts, the bean sprouts over powered the turkey sandwich. It was still good but not as good - especially with that after taste.  I don't really see us coming here too often for the sandwiches - but with the cookies, lemon squares, and that 5-layer brownie, I'll still find an excuse to come in."}
{"text":"Their lunch is pretty good, but If you want a really great cookie or cinnamon role THIS IS THE PLACE. Sweet Cakes and Cinnabon are tied for the best cinnamon role I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place does serve good sandwiches for lunch. Variety of desserts to choose from. I would highly recommend trying their cookies."}
{"text":"Extremely mediocre quality for what you pay. Ok to eat there in a pinch, but you'd be better off heading to a Paradise Bakery if you're in the mood for a soup/sandwich/cookie kind of meal (or even Subway).   The dinning area addition to the main room looks like an afterthought and is treated like one: dirty tables everywhere, cramped and poorly placed drink station, chairs strewn about, etc.   The owner, Kelly, meandered about the entire time chatting extensively with several groups of regulars/friends that came and went and so I had high-hopes of kindly relaying my disappointment with her when I left. When I asked if I could speak with her, the counter-girl went back to Kelly's office(?) and stood int he doorway. I could not  hear the conversation, but it went on for quite a while (45 seconds or so - longer than I needed to offer my comments) and when the young lady came back she informed me that \"she's too busy right now, but you can call back tomorrow morning if you want.\" No thanks."}
{"text":"The Pecan Roll, always get the Pecan Roll it's to die for and meets all that cinnamony nutty bready goodness you know you really want.  The cookies are also good, I haven't had anything else because I'm usually just dropping in to pick up a pecan roll on my way home.  The staff is always friendly, never have had an issue."}
{"text":"really awesome cookies, havent had their breakfast or lunch, try the sugar cookies"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots in Mesa. The Turkey Delight and Greek Salad are my go-to items. They are pretty tasty, but nothing too fancy. The cookies, though? Huge and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Still not quite sure what's in the 5 layer brownie, might have something addictive though. I tried one and a half brownies to try to find out. It was a little soft for my taste, but that was easily solved after a few minutes in the freezer."}
{"text":"Sweet Cakes feature on food network prompt our trip to Arizona.  I love sugar in every form, and literally drooled watching the cinnamon roll get smothered in a diabetes amount of sugar. Perfect.  Our last day of our arizona trip, we trucked over to Sweet Cakes, we took home a glazed cinnamon roll, the 5 layered brownie, and the sugar cookie.  I hate to admit, we came for the cinnamon roll, however I was really bummed.  Maybe I had to have it right out of the oven, it was more chewy than flakey, just like all of the cinnamon rolls I've had. However... the 5 layer brownie and the sugar cookie was well worth the trip. It was so delicious!  The 5 layer brownie was soft, moist, with the layers of chips, marshmellow, gave this texture. Literally the icing on the brownie made it. Sugar cookie killed me, it was not crunchy, ans the frosting balanced the sugar cookie all together.  I'm very glad we made the 7 hour trip, I even shopped at the little boutique and purchased some adorable gifts next door!"}
