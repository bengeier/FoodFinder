{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that this place is amazing!!!! Right when I walked in the first time I felt a good vibe.  Misty was her name she greeted me with a smile and was very polite made me feel like I've known her for years.  I even remembered her name usually I forget people's names.  She was telling me about the specials they had and if I wanted water while I was waiting for my food.  Very outgoing and friendly. This was an amazing experience I almost felt as if I was at the happiest place on earth \"Disneyland\" haha anyways I ordered pizza and wings I ordered two style pizzas a regular and stuffed NAPOLITIANA recommended by MIGUEL N here on Yelp.  Misty said he was also a friendly gentlemen that was satisfied with the pizza.  This pizza has fresh ingredients and worth every dollar.  My family was visiting from out of town so I was a little worried that it wouldn't be what we expected but even my family that came from New Jersey said they couldn't believe we had pizza places that were this good it made them feel at home haha!! So if you want good pizza this is the place.  I will be coming here more often. BYE BYE to  all the other pizza places I've been to in AZ there is  a new sheriff in town :) oh and once again thank you Misty and Miguel you guys are the real MVPs ;)"}
{"text":"Great new pizza place in Surprise!! Food was wonderful and service was amazing!!! TRY THE GARLIC KNOTTS!!! OUTSTANDING"}
{"text":"Horrible service via phone. Just called and got hung up on could hear people talking in the background ordering in person a customer trying to help the cashier on change 

The guy who answered I advised I could not hear him and clearly he could not hear me as he asked me 3 times if I have ordered before. And the answer was NO I told him I can not hear him over the women talking he hung up on me.  This was my first time calling to try something new and trust me it will be my last time calling.   I will NEVER order from her in the future and tell others."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try Nick & Ben's Pizza tonight after searching on yelp for top rated spots in Surprise and we are so glad we did. We were warmly greeted by Misty who took the time to go over the menu with us and explain how everything was made in house by scratch. She chatted with us and made us feel so welcome. We ordered the stuffed pizza and Caesar salad. The pizza was great! Stuffed with sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, and ground beef. It was delicious!!! Misty came back to check on us and discovered our teenage girls weren't big fans as they were expecting \"normal\" pizza. To our complete surprise Ben made the girls a small cheese pizza to share and brought it out to them because he wanted them to leave happy and full. I couldn't believe the generosity! This is a family restaurant with a big heart....exactly the type of place you want to keep coming back to. Misty was a gem and made my night. Great food and amazing service! What more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"Great crust, tasty sauce, excellent toppings. Wings are tasty with good spice. Entire family enjoyed the meal. I hope the Surprise community starts to notice and  support this nice little restaurant. Misty and staff are great and take good care of you while you are there. I think they are getting all the new restaurant processes worked out so expect a little wait during peak times. Delivery time is normal and food arrived hot. Nice change of pace and a welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try today and was pleasantly delighted. We tried the Medium Cheese pizza with 10 wings special. The pizza had very good taste and the crust was pretty good too. I prefer a more firm crust but this was just a bit more on the softer side. The wings were small but the honey bbq sauce was really tasty. It was perfect for the two of us so I'm good with that. The beer came out ice cold as expected and the service was good too. Two young people served us and were very pleasant and attentive. Over all I'm satisfied and the price was reasonable also. I didn't expect anything less from Nick who runs the best non-fast food place in Surprise Nick's Diner."}
{"text":"I was very upset to see me and my friend get little to no attention while we were here. The food was good but there wasn't much interaction with our main server. She made sure she took care of everyone else and went into detailed discussions with them about the menu but did not with me and my friend."}
{"text":"Go ahead - give this place a try, you won't be sorry!   We were looking for something that wasn't a franchise - SO sick of the usual franchise restaurants here in Surprise!   The pizza is very good; not thick crust, not thin, just right - not soggy - fairly priced with a good lot of quality toppings.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Surprise and it's not even close.  Crust is perfect.  The special is the way to go.  Only knock is the limited delivery area so we have to go pick up but that's fine too.  Worth it.  It's been the same young lady at the counter each time we've picked up and she is fantastic.  Very polite and gets you in and out."}
{"text":"Well I have to say this place is nothing like Nick's dinerII.... hard to believe it's has one of the same owners. I ordered a Lg pizza and a gluten free pizza( severely allergic to gluten) when the driver showed up had a lg pizza and wing special! Had the driver call to clarify this and they argued with him and I that I had called and changed my order! (Wrong customer) Instead of correcting the issue they just kept arguing that I had called again and changed my order! The young kid put an Angie on the phone and she said I was basically shit out of luck and to come in to the restuarant to talk about it. Clearly if I wanted to do that I wouldn't have ordered delivery! Came in to show her my phone and that I had only called once! They still insisted on arguing so at this point I can honestly saw I will never be back! Lost a customer.

Update...So I decided to give Nick and Bens pizza a second chance after I had time to cool off! My gluten free pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and pasta ever! My entire family loved it which means it has to be amazing. There is no pleasing 4 children and 2 adults at one place :) but Nick and Ben's Pizza was the absolute best and pleased the whole clan :) thanks Nick and Ben's!"}
{"text":"We officially found our favorite pizza joint in Surprise! My kids are never super excited about having pizza (strange, huh) but literally everyone in my big family of six--including four picky children--was raving about the food. We got a pizza with meatballs and mild wings. Wow, the pizza was delicious! It was cooked well, the sauce was soooo good, and the meatballs didn't have that old funky taste that some pizzerias are plagued with. The wings were amazing. My daughter said \"these wings are heaven\" and my son said \"favorite pizza ever.\" So, yeah, I think it's a winner. It's definitely a winner for my husband and I since we usually have to beg them to eat pizza! Oh, and the staff is super nice. There was an error on my order (due to a typo on the menu and the fact that this place is so new) but the management offered several options regarding how to fix it. Needless to say, after all of my raving, we will be back again and again! Thanks Nick & Ben!"}
{"text":"This is our second time back and it doesn't disappoint! Love the crust, not too thin, and just the right amount of chew.  
Wings are great too! Just crispy enough, but plenty of meat on the bone. 
Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing! I just wish their pizza was thicker but the veggies in their combination make it totally worth it. I would definitely come back everytime I head into Surprise."}
{"text":"Best Pizza and always great Service!!  Love Nick and Ben- doing such a great job!!!  The food is always great!"}
{"text":"When Nick and Ben's first opened we decided to try their pizza on a Saturday night and just dropped in. We were greeted by Misty who was welcoming, asking if we had been in before and then offered up the specials and gave great suggestions on what kind of pizza we might like. Our take home order was ready in about 20 minutes. The pizza was very good. We decided the next time we would dine in and try some other items on the menu. This past Friday night we dined in. There were customers already seated. We were seated right away. Our entire stay there was a steady stream of walk in/take outs.  Misty waited on us and again she was welcoming, offering to try the garlic knots which were hand made and so very delicious (my husband now says we will double order on these the next time). We ordered the pizza again and this time shared a calzone which was huge! Calzones are tricky...you either get a overcooked crust with a hot center or a cold center with an under cooked crust. N&B got it right! The service was excellent but a little slow. Misty made it worth our time there. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I want to start this review off by saying I'm not the big \"yelper\" type, but I have to. I want to add that I chose to do this after to times trying this amazing place. I'll keep it short and sweet, the food is very good and pizza was great, but it doesn't all happen until your greeted and waited on by Misty! I have to say running dealership service departments is love to have someone like Misty in front of my guests, she's fun, energetic, and an all around genuine person. It's a rare occasion you encounter such a person at an establishment these days but you will once you meet her. I truly believe Nick has a great thing going with this pizza restaurant (only because I'm a New Yorker and always eat pizza) but he's filled it the right items, ambience and staff. I highly recommend Nick & Bens to the whole valley to try."}
{"text":"I told the management that the toilet in the woman's restroom is running so bad it flushes itself -  LAST YEAR. It's still not fixed. They are wasting so much water! I will not patronize a business that is not ecologically conscious- ever."}
{"text":"Was ok Pizza a bit bland and same with the wings very blah. Would have given 4 stars but the wait staff needs work ."}
{"text":"Ordered the XL one topping pizza and 20 wings. First off the lady that answered the phone was very polite and friendly. It only took 15 minutes and it was a great pizza. Good dough, sauce and cheese and in a good ratio. They also don't cheap out on the toppings, I got mushrooms and most places put just a handful but they covered the pizza in mushrooms. Their wings are also very good. I would highly recommend this place and found a new pizza place."}
{"text":"I love their white pizza! We've ordered a couple times and haven't been disappointed! They are so nice and the foods awesome!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza, not just in AZ but it beats pizza I have had in NewYork and Chicago. I don't want to eat pizza anywhere else anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent service, but wasn't impressed with the pizza. Not my kind of crust, not much cheese, overall kind of flavorless. Doubt I'll go again.... Disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good! Updated to 5-stars. My only suggestion is the crust needs to be cooked just a bit more or at least in a hotter oven perhaps? It is just a little bit too flimsy. A better char on the bottom would help--though it is still better than most any other place as is... I'd call it a close 2nd to NYPD crust. But here they don't skimp on the toppings, so it makes up for it."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza and wings special and the white pizza for take out it was great! Cheese pizza had great flavor and my husband enjoyed the wings but my favorite definitely the white pizza! Loved the ricotta it was excellent!"}
{"text":"We have ordered several times from here. The first couple times were really good. Tonight was a little different. I ordered half cheese half pepperoni and received all pepperoni. When calling in my order I had to repeat everything several times and it still wasn't correct. We will probably give them another shot but they need to step it up if the are going to charge 32.00 for pizza, wings and a sandwich."}
{"text":"Garlic knots were phenomenal. I would eat those everyday. They were fresh, hot, soft, and had great flavor. The wings were also good not amazing. I would definitely go back for the garlic knots if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Walked in here on a whim while my boyfriend and I were waiting to meet someone in the area. It was later in the day and they didn't have any single slices left so we ordered a medium to share. We also ordered the garlic knots which were beyond awesome! The woman who was helping us was so accommodating and friendly. When we got the bill to pay there was a deduction listed as a manager compensation. Don't know why, but that was nice of them! Delicious pizza, great service and comfortable atmosphere. Too bad it's an hour away from us. I highly recommend this place! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"A great pizza and wings experience.  Would have given them a 4.5 if it would have let me.  Only reason to not be a 5 is personal or five is personal preference.  Service and quality was excellent.  Wings were a touch spicy for mild but my son Who likes spicy loved them.  Pizza was great.  We found a new place in town to get our pizza!"}
{"text":"OK so maybe I'm bias because I work here. But can you really hold that against me (I think not). I just wanna say that before I even tried the food here I always hated think crust pizza and BBQ flavor on anything. But then I came in with my son and ordered the Napolitana Special pizza and honey BBQ wings (for him not me) and garlic knots. Let me tell you it was love at first bite. I had no choice but to convert. Not only do I love thin crust now, but I can't eat pizza anywhere else (I don't know what I'll do when I go on vacation). And then after my son keep raving about the wings I had to give em a try. Normally I'm a hot wing kinda girl who loves her ranch dressing, but now there's no talking myself back to hot. And last but not least, the Garlic Knots are made from the same fresh homemade pizza dough. They are twisted and topped with a buttery garlic sauce that'll melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Dang I love this place! Can't believe I have not posted a review yet. Pizza is great. If you ate here when it first opened but have not been back please try it again. They really have stepped up their game. The sandwiches are great. The wings are really good. Make sure to order them cooked extra crispy if you like a good crisp wing. The garlic knots are awesome. Everything is great but the fries do not hold up to go. They need to figure out a better way to package them so they don't steam themselves to death. That is the only thing I have to say that isn't 100% positive. Staff is really nice and the delivery guy know us pretty well by now. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, and great value. The pizza,  calzone, past and salads were fantastic. The staff was great! Food came out of the kitchen fast, I would highly recommend this spot, especially for families or anyone with a big appetite:-)

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is our first pizza from here. We had Calzones and a steak hoagie last time which was awesome . The Sicilian was fantastic from the crust to the fresh cut veggies and extra cheese. The sauce is soo good you just want more . The pieces are large and plentiful. I could only eat one piece , my husband and son usually have several pieces but , not this time ,  there Is leftover  pizza for Sunday brunch . I have fallen in Love with the combo platter. The guys loved the bread sticks don't fry at home so this is such a treat . Going to try Pasta next I think . Looked Soo good !! Thanks, everyone the service was just as great as the last time . Ordering the pizza was simple as just a phone call.  :-) The Stewart family."}
{"text":"Serve was friendly but the food was great. Pizza was thin crust and crispy. Wing were tasty and leave room for dessert. Only complaint was the blue cheese dressing was disappointing. One more point, they don't offer coffee."}
{"text":"We love Nick & Ben's. We love the. Food and the staff.  We've been there several times and order pizza, wings, zucchini, lasagna and calzone. You can't go wrong at Nick & Ben's. Everything tastes great and they are very affordable."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the surprise area for sure! Great new york style pizza with a delicious crust. Give it a try. Misty serves me when I'm there. She is the best! Very good at her job and always has a smile for you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. Always quick delivery, great service, and the food is excellent. I highly recommend this place. I really like the fact that it has other Italian food options besides pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and their garlic knots are some of the best I've ever had. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time. Must say, all other reviews are pretty spot on. Pizza was quite greasy ..... but delicious. Apps, pizza & wings all came out quick. XL 1 top & 25 wings for $23.99 - definitely worth it.
Their pizza is quite thin but if you can eat it before the grease gets it, it stays pretty crispy. All in all, we were happy with this place."}
{"text":"I just love love love love their pizza and their hospitality!!!
I have been going here for a number of years now (the old Nick's) and have not been disappointed yet!
Great food and people!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service. I was told pizza would be ready in 30mins for carry out and when I got there I was told it would be another 8mins. Awful way to please and meet needs of customers."}
{"text":"Couldn't find a menu online, so I called them and got directed to an image on the yelp profile. After checking with everyone to see what they want I called back to Order only to be told that there is no delivery tonight. Wouldn't that of been useful information during our first call? 

Tried them again a few weeks later, took 2 phone calls and over an hour to finally get 1 pizza and wings delivered. It was okay but lacked flavor, the wings were rubbery and Luke warm. Very disappointing experience both times."}
{"text":"1st time ....Tried pizza and wings tonight via carry out.  Had their 18\" XL \"special\" and 10 medium wings for $26.   Good pizza - soft and chewy crust and good flavor.  Just ok wings (we like our wings more crispy).   

We will be back to try dining in and will put this in our list of regular take out pizza places."}
{"text":"Finally, A great New York Style pizza in Surprise, hands down the best. Perfect ratio of ingredients, friendly staff. they also offer a stuffed option for only $2, well worth it!"}
{"text":"Often times businesses have the wrong people answering their phone's.   But over the last two days I have called Nick & Ben's Pizza Company  on two different occasions.    Both times I have spoken to two different girls.  Both of them were incredibly nice and helpful.   My mom picked up the pie.  The first thing my mom said was how sweet the ladies were who helped her.   

If the pizza is as good as their service, it will be excellent!"}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was great!  I had the Lasagna and hubby had eggplant parmigiana- both fantastic!  Cody did an outstanding job!  Everyone should try this place."}
{"text":"Best pizza spot I have found in town. Killer wings with a extra large pizza for 23.99. You can't beat that! Pizza/wings were awesome!"}
{"text":"Hate to say it there's a new pizza guy in town,wife and kids wanted to change it up and found  the pizza dough,sauce and crust perfectly  done.Ordered hot wings well done and with a homemade dip it was really very good,the wings were fat,yes big and juicy,we will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Had the white pizza, stuffed pepperoni pizza, and some garlic knots and mozzarella sticks. Everything was so good but those mozzarella sticks are amazing. Some places you barely get any cheese but these sticks are all cheese with a light coating. Amazing! Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good had a thinner crust...not very dough-y. The wings were TINY...very tiny...good flavor though."}
{"text":"Walked in got a to go order special large cheese with 20 wings.  Took about 20 minutes to get my food.  The staff looks a little in-organized but it's a new business that should iron out after a while. 
Pizza was good had a good flavor sauce, and could taste a good amount of garlic. 
The wings another story; I asked for extra crispy wings and got the total opposite.  Not sure if the crispy was sent over to the cook or my wings sat in the back while my pizza was still cooking. 
Everything came out to $24 with tax. I overhear someone saying they have some specials the day after a home sports team wins- not sure might have to ask them"}
{"text":"No doubt one of the better pizza joint in town. Staff is very nice, and never have had any problems with the service. One negative is, since we live about six miles away. Some times we don't want to drive there, however they only deliver up to a four mile radius.
However, their food is worth it. We have only had two different items. Pizza, and the Meatball Sandwich. Pizza is very good, peppers are very good, sauce has a little kick, cheese and pizza dough are great. We always have our pizza cooked extra well done. and they do it right every time.
The meatball sandwich is really good, meatball has great flavor, added with the cheese, sauce, and baked bread. A very delicious sandwich. 
Nick & Ben's will see us a lot!"}
{"text":"We had the Sicilian special and garlic knots. They were amazing. Their ranch us delicious as well. The service was prompt a day the price was fair. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not as impressed this time.  Had delivered dinner. Chicken parmesan and zeppole.  It was good the zeppole was not warm like it was the last time.  Fyi delivery is not free if you live less than 4 miles away. I live under a mile, delivery $3.00."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, seemed a bit pricey though.  Friendly kitchen staff when I walked in to pick up my order."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and so much more

Nick & Ben's Pizza Company is reminiscent of the neighborhood pizzeria you remember visiting after school to grab a slice of pie with a coke, and relax with your friends.

Nick & Ben's offers no-frills delicious pizza, served either by the slice, or as a whole pie. Nick & Ben's makes their dough fresh daily and splash on a generous portion of homemade sauce then slather your pie with freshest toppings of your choice. This pie is the perfect combination of crispy crust, delicious sauce, and the perfect amount of toppings.

In addition, too delicious Pies Nick & Ben's offers salads, calzones, sandwiches, desserts, wings, pasta, and an assortment of appetizers. I can't wait to visit again and try other options off their menu.

So, If you are a pizza fan (and who is not?) You have to visit Nick & Ben's you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow so rude! Called to ask if they delivered was put on hold by someone before I could squeak out a word and some rude girl answered and said \"um yeah\" I said I was on hold and just waiting to ask if you delivered she then said \"uhh yeah\" I said ok can I place an order to which she then asked for my address I said \"uhhhh you live to far that's a 7 mile drive we only go 4\" so I guess they will only deliver if your within 4-5 minutes of their shop that extra 3-4 minutes friggin kills them."}
{"text":"If you want some good pizza you need to try Nick and Ben's!  They had a great deal with a XL pizza and 20 wings and then we added a calzone.  All was delicious.  Their crust and sauce is awesome and the wings were really crispy and the sauce was good.  They also have salads, sandwiches, and Italian dishes.  The service was great, you can tell they love working there, and it was super clean.  Try it out when you want pizza the next time!"}
{"text":"We'd award a 5 star on this one. Accommodating, fresh and tasty. Non-greasy pizza like so many other pizza places are. If you are looking for a gluten fee options I would recommend N&B Pizza. 
We'd be inclined to order again and recommend to neighbors."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the west valley! Amazing crust, great prices, and excellent service! We are pizza connoisseurs and we have tried a lot of different places but I'm not ordering from anywhere else nowthe white pizza is amazing, and the pepperoni pizza is perfectI give Nick and Bens a 5"}
{"text":"Met some family for lunch and tried out the Nick and Ben's Pizza. Overall, enjoyed our lunch and look forward to grubbing here again.  We all selected the $9.99 lunch special that included 2 slices, 6 wings, and a drink.  The pizza was fine, did not blow my socks off but was flavorful.  The honey barbecue wings I really enjoyed. They were perfectly crispy, just perfect and the sauce was decent and plentiful.  I look forward to trying the medium next time. The staff included a young gal behind the register, who also served us and she was very helpful and out going. Overall, a nice lunch and will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Good lunch deal! 2 slices 6 wings 9.99$

I am really full now, but enjoyed it! 

Pizza is tasty and big, a lot of cheese and 50cent toppings! The wings juicy and good! 

Will come again."}
{"text":"If you're that annoying group that shows up at night to grab some pizza and beer, oh wait that was us. 
A few friends and I decided it was going to be a pizza and beer night. We were told Nick&Ben's was the go to pizza place, so WHY NOT. The staff was very friendly, helpful and accommodating. After a few beers, we became a little needy, but they were kind and patient. 

From wings, calzones, whole pizzas, beer and more beer.. (Decent beer selection, some of us were sad about the lack of IPAs - WHATEVER) Nick&Ben's did not disappoint. I myself enjoyed the wings (dry with sauce on the side) and a special calzone. 

One of the pizzas, the bbq chicken one, looked like someone poured a few ladles full of sauce onto it. I'm not a fan of sauce, hence the dry wings, but everyone else loved it. 

Overall, most likely come back for the special pizza. Dough was not too fluffy or thin, veggies were fresh, and sauce was good for me."}
{"text":"The service was great!  Cody our server was exceptional and fun.  He was always checking to make sure we were ok.  The food was good and plentiful.  Even had plenty to take home for later."}
{"text":"Just had lunch...two BIG slices, salad and drink for about $8.50.  The pizza was equivalent to 1/2 a medium pie.  Great taste, value & service.  Highly recommend 
."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the take-out was ready within 15 min.   That is what got this pizza place a score of three.  The pizza itself was very greasy which usually means cheap ingredients.  The wings tasted good but not as much meat as I've gotten on wings from other places."}
{"text":"First time guest. Shared fried zucchini appetizer & large pizza with a friend. The couple I was with are regulars. Fabulous people. Particularly Misty. 

Cannot say enough great things about this Italian restaurant. Wish I could give them 10 stars. 

Their menu is moderately priced and I thought a bargain for the quality. So much fun there...I want to work there."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The garlic knots are a tasty appetizer. Misty was our server and she's a gem!"}
{"text":"A really tasty pizza, quick and for a great price. Got half cheese and half pepperoni and it was just how I like it: big slices not too thin, not too thick, delicious and not oversalted. The one star I took off is because the pepperoni slices were the little ones like you get in a package- I'd prefer the bigger ones you have to slice yourself, but it was still amazing. 

Did I mention the large was $13 out the door? For this pizza, that's a bargain. You can't get a small at NYPD for that."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon three weeks back and it was completely empty and we were the only two customers dining in. While waiting for our pie there were customers coming in to pick up orders, which is a good sign. 

We ordered a meat lovers pizza and it was awesome. The crust was light and crisp and the cheese/meat ratio was perfect. The service was good and she was always smiling. One of the owners even came out to our table with some garlic knots to try-damn they were good as well.

They have daily specials and decent prices. We definitely will come back to try other menu items and for the pizza. I you're ever on our side of town you should stop in and try the pizza as well.

(9/17 update) Came back in today with a really close friend as we kept bragging about the pizza to him. The hostess/waitress appeared overwhelmed with seating, taking orders and answering the phone, she was the only staff working the front of the restaurant. She took us to our seat and forgot about us, until my husband walked up to the counter to order our drinks, I'm not sure how long we would have sat there with no food or drinks. 

We once again ordered the meat lovers and it was delicious. It was nice to see more customers today in comparison to out first visit, but the service was subpar this time. Will this cause me to think twice before coming back? No, the pies are good as well as the prices. Hopefully with time and more experience the waitress/hostess will be more attentive or they will hire additional help."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food! Honestly, the best NY style pizza and chicken wings in town! You can also order as take out, the staff is always friendly and very attentive of the customers, have gone multiple times and will go back more."}
{"text":"In Surprise, we don't have much too choose from. Let me rephrase that, we have a ton of chains and very few locally owned restaurants/shops. It sucks because I am a huge supporter of local places and will always encourage and frequent mom & pop stuff. I always make it a point to try a new place in Surprise when it opens (or shortly after). I've been to Nick & Bens twice now and both visits were delish! The first time I ordered a white pizza and a stuffed type of pepporoni and sausage pizza. We also ordered wings which I'll get to in a minute. The white pizza was absolutely phenomenal. Marinara gives me heartburn so I can eat this white pizza without having to pop a couple of alka-seltzers later that night. The ricotta cheese they use is tasty and a good consistency. The stuffed style, I wasn't a fan of. It was too heavy for my liking but they men in the family seemed to love it. 

The second time we went, we had the white pizza again and two pepperoni pizzas. They were both cooked to perfection and the ingredients were spot on. Now the wings...we had the mild and the honey bbq. They were really good but I would have liked to see and tasted more sauce. They were a good combination of crunchy and moist. (yep, I said the word moist). We ordered 40 wings and received 4 sauce cups of ranch. Our second trip, for the large white pizza, 2 XL pepperoni pizzas and 40 wings, the total was $70 bucks. This fed about 6 adults and 3 kids. So about $7.50 per person. I think that's a little high for pizza & wings but that's just me; I'm kind of a tightwad. Why did we decide to get it even though it was $70 bucks? Because it was worth it. I'm tight not stupid. I love a good pizza joint and when it's a local business that's even better. 

I've never eaten inside so I can't review the actual sit down restaurant but from the looks of it, the place was clean and a standard booth style set-up. There were a few tv's in there, I believe. The staff is incredbily friendly and is proud of their establishment. The owner (I'm assuming) is a NY Jets fan, so I won't hold that against him (I'm a NE fan). They have alot to choose from and you really need to try this place if you haven't. Always support local! Be a localist! When you spend $100 in a local AZ establishment, around $50 bucks stays in Arizona. When you eat at a chain, around $7 stays in Arizona."}
{"text":"Fantastic new pizza place!  The garlic knots are out of this world and the pizza is delicious.  Service is top tier.  They are incredibly professional and approachable, it's clear they enjoy what they do.  Forget Dominos, go here instead, you WON'T regret it!  We will return again and again."}
{"text":"Paid up front came back to pickup and was approached by manager and said there will be an extra 3.00 dollar charge because cashier forgot to add, so had to wait all because management was to cheap to eat the cost for there mistake ."}
{"text":"the food is good and tasty. 

the one star i took out is because of the much waiting time and the precautions they use it for the food prep & bringing it to the customers.

The employee's do not taking any precautions for the hands when they bringing the food and the Head for the hair to not fallen off into food.

Except that everything is good."}
{"text":"This was the greasiest pizza ever. The crust was limp dripping of oil. The sauce was flavorless. Little Caesars had more flavor. The sausage had no kick or flavor.  All I can taste was bread and garlic. The lack of sauce is really irritating. I'm tired of NYC style pizza. It's all bread and grease."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza for Surprise AZ. My go to used to be either Lucky's or Mario's in El Mirage, but Nick and Ben's is always fresh and it's true NY style. Reasonably priced too"}
{"text":"My dad said this place was really good so I thought I would give it a try. I went in to order a pizza to go. I wasn't really greeted by anyone, just a rude young man at the register. He looked at me like \"yes? What do you want?\" I said I want to place an order so he replied, \"ok, so what so you want?\" Well it was my first time in so I asked for a menu because they didn't have a menu board. I thought to myself....ya know there are 5 other pizza places on this corner and i have a choice so we went to Barros.  Normally I hate leaving bad reviews and I should take the time and speak to the owner, but hey, they hired the guy.  Customer service is a dying art."}
{"text":"Good pizza and great wings! Fast and fresh friendly and they have draft beer. Down the road from my house and I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings could be a little bit better but still good . love the fact it's not a chain , tried the egg plant not bad .Staff is awesome , think one of the partner is on site always checking with his patrons ."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome! I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. It didn't taste as authentic as I hoped, but still satisfied my pasta craving. The pizza though. Oh my goodness. It was perfect. Cheesy enough without over doing it. Crust wasn't too crunchy. Toppings were cooked but not over cooked. Very yummy. And they deliver!"}
{"text":"We hadn't  been to Nicks old location since they moved. We knew there was a pizza place there now but had been reluctant to try it. I'm so glad we did Tuesday night. The pizza was excellent and my salad was fresh and tasty. We definitely will go back."}
{"text":"The best pizza place in surprise. Ended up going in right before they closed and nothing but smiles on their faces. They ended up marking us a special treat  before we left. I loved the pizza sauce it had a  nice hint of garlic to it. This is our new pizza spot. You have to give it a try."}
{"text":"We have a new pizza place!  While we haven't eaten in the restaurant yet, this pizza even take out ... and cold later is REALLY GOOD!!!  We will definitely have to take the time to eat I and try some of the other menu items!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! You can tell the food is made with love. The owners were so sweet gave us coupons to come back they were so nice. My family will definitely be coming back! It was so homely and we felt so welcomed this place is so reasonably priced! The pizza is amazing and the wings are so tasty!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were there a few days ago. She enjoyed her calzone and I ordered stuff shells (manicotti). I thought the sauce came straight out of a tomato sauce jar; no taste except for the tomatoes. They did stuff the shells with ricotta cheese. I thought their food tasted bland."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time. Our friends had been and highly recommended it. We had the pizza and wings special. Really good! Everything that can be made from scratch is made from scratch. Even the sausage on our pizza was made in house. We took some left over pizza home and my husband and I argued over who got to eat it for breakfast! Service was excellent also. 
We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area from the east coast and have been searching for good pizza. We tried a pie with 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 meatball and it was pretty good. When they brought it to the table, we all smiled when looking at it. It was baked perfectly and tasted great. I would have given 5 stars if it would have been a bit crispy. We also had fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks as appetizers and both were tasty. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very very friendly over the phone and really good pizza and wings. Really awesome price too!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great. We had pepperoni, meatball and sausage. The crust is on the thinner side which I like, New York style. They have a thick crust if that's your thing. I had the meat and cheese ravioli which was the special. It came w/ a breadstick and side salad. The portion is very large. The sauce is clearly homemade and I really liked it. I'm very happy with my order. The lettuce was super crispy and cold, I love that. I want to come back and try a calzone and a sandwich. Nick came by and said hello to each table. That's what an owner should do, I believe. Our waitress was super knowledgeable about the menu. She was very friendly. I'm glad this place opened. Good food for a good price."}
{"text":"We have been here on three separate occasions for a family dinner, or a daddy daughter dinner and have not been disappointed. The food is good, it's quiet and the staff is friendly. I hate big loud chain pizza places, and this is not that. I hope it doesn't turn into that either. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pizza. 
On par with Barros.
Expect unlike Barros they are fast with quick service. The only problem is, once they get busy the wheels fall off...
They  have some good specials
14\" cheese or pepperoni for $7.00 is anl netter deal than the junk pizza at the chains...
So unless I'm getting Chicago style deep dish this is my spot.
They only get 4 stars because the zucchini and garlic knots or whatever are not that good.
Just stick to pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a large meat lovers for dinner.  Staff and service was friendly and great.  Warmly welcomed when we came in.  Prompt service.  Answered any questions we had about the menu. Restaurant was clean and spacious.
Lots of available parking outside. 
Ordered a large meat lovers pizza which was very good - wasn't undercooked or overlooked/burnt.  It was very tasty and well seasoned.  The pizza was a little on the very greasy/oily side and somewhat salty (-1). 
Overall, I was pleased with the good and service, and will probably return."}
{"text":"Read the reviews / looked at the photos and thought we'd try it - there aren't many pizza delivery services in our area. The pizza was very thin (which was fine), but also very soggy.. there wasn't hardly any marinara sauce on the pizza it was just like cheese and bread. The mozzarella sicks were uncooked as well which made it feel like they just took some cheese sticks out of the fridge and breaded them lol.. sad we spent $25 on one pizza and cheese sticks. Defiantly disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Food is okay, not great. Thin pizza crust soggy.  The Sicilian crust was okay, however, the Owner was extremely rude! We will not be back."}
{"text":"We are so lucky to live right down the street from N&B pizza. Their Greek pizza is phenomenal! The cheese they cook with keeps you coming back for more.  Friendly people, great service.  Great place for families. BONUS: if you like within 4 miles of Nick &Ben's Pizza your delivery order is FREE!"}
{"text":"Great place! I called and asked if they would deliver to my house. They said it's not in their delivery area but would do it any way. Nice! They told me 45 minutes and the bell rang at like 30 minutes. Woo hoo! The pizza was really good and the honey bbq wings were phenomenal. Really reasonable price, too. Try them out!"}
{"text":"I had driven by this quite a few times and had seen the sign \"Opening Soon\" during the early Summer months.  Well, they finally opened about 2 months ago and I decided to check them out.  I called them up and placed my order for a large pepperoni pizza.  Drove down and picked it up.  Here is how it was............

Large Pepperoni Pizza-  This was your standard 16 inch large pizza.  Looked great, and tasted pretty good.  It reminded me of some of the old pizza places around where I grew up in Los Angeles.  Nothing that would blow you away, but still really solid and a great \"local\" place.  The sauce was probably my favorite part of the pizza.  I am not usually one to compliment pizza sauce, but this stuff was good.  The pizza was topped with plenty of cheese and a good amount of pepperoni.  The crust was medium/thin and had nice flavor to it.  The only thing I would change is that I would order it well done next time.  It could have used just a tad more crisping up in the oven.

Service was flat out awesome!  The lady on the phone was very nice and when I came in to pick up the pizza, the waitress/cashier lady was extremely enthusiastic and happy to see me.  We chatted for a bit and she could pick up on that it was my first time here.  She told me that I would love the pizza and she was right for the most part.  She also gave me one of their punch cards.  Buy 9 pizzas and get the 10th one free.  Score!

Overall, I was pretty impressed.  Surprise doesn't have too many great pizza options, and this is one of the better ones, by far!  I'm positive I will be back soon enough and may sample some of their other food too!  Glad to have you in Surprise, Nick and Ben!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY...
Starting off with the good, and pretty good it was, was the pizza. One reviewer stated that there was a garlic taste to the sauce, and yes there is. The garlic flavor is subtle when the pizza is hot but more pronounced as the pizza gets cooler. Also good were the wings. I could not taste that big of a difference between the hot and mild, but they were pretty good and my 13yr old daughter ate a mix of both and enjoyed them. What was also good, from my wife's point of view, because I did not taste it was the chef salad. It did look appetizing but there was a bad part of this salad which we will now get too. The Bad, as just mentioned about the salad, they forgot to add the dressing on the side like I requested it for my wife. Luckily, we had dressing at our house so that was saved. Another bad is their operations. Granted it is a new establishment and kinks need to be worked out and I will definitely be back next time to eat in the restaurant and give them another review. By the way, if you could not tell, this was a take out order. I ordered take out on September 12th at 4:40pm. Now the Ugly, stay away from the bread sticks! If you want to throw away $5.50, by all means, it's your money. They were barely warm and tasted like ones you would by in the frozen aisle for $1.99 so save your cash and pass on these gems. I would not be fair if I dont mention the appearance and customer service of the folks. Appearance looks good and clean. Well, they are new. Customer service, the lady there was very very friendly and said she would make sure my order was correct. Friendliness, A+, order correct, C.  Remember the missing dressing. Give this place a shot, pizza is very good. Similar to Luckys pizza on Bell and Reems but with a more garlicky sauce, or oil, not sure which it is. \"Peace\" ( Imagine me dropping the pizza box and walking away)"}
{"text":"Nick and Ben's is probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The sauce was fabulous but I think it was the crust that made it great. I even ate the ends which I never do. Misty was our server and she was outstanding. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Got the chicken parm hoagie, as shown in their main pic. Looks just like the pic, and tastes as good as it looks!"}
{"text":"This is our first time since they became a pizza restaurant. Like most Yelp options, we also found the food to be delicious, but there is a problem with the service: although the servers are great--friendly and hard workers--Nick & Ben don't hire enough to handle the amount of customers.

My wife had a pizza with house-made sausage, onions, and mushrooms while I had the eggplant parmigiana dinner.

In all fairness, I'm an impatient, transplanted New Yorker!"}
{"text":"Really good place I used to go to Barrows and iL primo but now that this place opened up I will be coming here. I usually order a vegetarian pizza with mushrooms peppers onions garlic spinach jalapeños and tomatoes and I get it cooked well done I can eat a whole large pizza by myself it is really good."}
{"text":"We are from the east coast and have been looking for good pizza since we got here 6 years ago!  This restaurant is amazing!  Tasted just like back home!"}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza. Greek salad is amazing. Meatballs are the best around.  Calzones are fantastic! Real friendly people too. I'm hooked. I love this place. Im so glad they are here. Try it you won't be disappointed. West side !!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. I ordered a pie takeout and it was very good. Not the best - I've become picky when it comes to pizza since I was born and raised in the northeast."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, wings were acceptable. pepperoni was oily.
Not up to NY quality, but not bad. crust bottom could be more crisp and wing skin could be more crisp. service was good. It is some of the closest to NY style in the area. good amount of cheese on pizza, they do not short change. Overall, good food, great value."}
