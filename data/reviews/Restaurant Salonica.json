{"text":"First guy on the phone didn't understand me well but was polite and told me to hold. Next guy understood me a bit better which is great in it's self. I speak low and have a southern accent so it's always hard no matter where I'm at. Food was ok. I got the gyro combo. Gyro was really good while hot. The poutine was ok. Gravy was slightly sweet (nutmeg I think) but the fries were good alone. Delivery was prompt. Was carry out food not fine dining so I was satisfied with what I paid for."}
{"text":"This has to be the most disgusting food I have ever ordered in my entire life. I was drinking lastnight and needed to stuff my face before going to bed. Even being drunk I was unable to eat the garbage. It is hands down the worst cheeseburger and Poutine I have EVER had in my life. I feel so ashamed and upset that I actually spent 25$ for these two things thinking of what I could have eaten elsewhere. The burger which I had to remove from the bun and just eat it was full of coleslaw that soaked the bun. I'm actually impressed with myself that I even ate the burger without the bun which isn't real meat. It was a mushy wet mess. The Poutine was extremely large and covered in a garbage cheese and horrible gravy. It was dry, old not fresh in anyway. Aside from about 5 bites it went to the garbage. Even drunk this food was intolerable and unacceptable. Worst food ever!!! I'm assuming the only reason this place is in business is because of drunk people like me who fall upon it because nothing else is open. I assure you that if you order from here you will highly regret it! Even worse not only do you have to tip the driver they charge a delivery fee lol Shameful!"}
{"text":"First of all, I agree with Gabriel.  The woman on the phone is C U Next Tuesday all the way and I never understood how she could stay there so long.   Here's my deal with this restaurant - I've never eaten there, I've only ever ordered out, hence my lack of affinity for the rude old lady.  What keeps me coming back? Italian Poutine. They don't use cheese curds, just shredded cheddar, but they broil it and it's just incredible, especially with the somewhat sweet spaghetti sauce they use.  So it's a toss-up. If you can deal with a human leather bag who sounds like she huffs on 2 packs of smokes a day and constantly tries to upsell your order, prepare to eat one of the best Italian poutines of your life."}
{"text":"Horrible service! The lady on the phone is atrociously disagreeable. She was trying to force me to get two Pizzas when I just wanted one, then I kept telling her I wanted one medium pepperoni and she was trying to make me get a large vegetarian. I flipped and told her I didn't want anything and I hung up, she then called me two times and left me two messages. Very unprofessional, the entire thing just felt creepy, don't ever bother getting anything there. I'm surprise that place is still open."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Ordered salad, was delivered mouldy looking cheesecake (that's not salad).  Ordered mushroom pasta, delivered a soupy dish that might have been  bolognese inspired...different sized macaroni noodles, some kind of grey meat? I'm not even sure, but all that to say I don't eat meat and ordered a mushroom pasta with no meat in the description."}
{"text":"Heuuu... Que dire? Le resto est très vieillot, aucun style à l'intérieur. Le service est moyen. La nourriture est assez ordinaire. Le seul point positif selon moi c'est qu'il est ouvert toute la nuit, les déjeuner sont 24h et la livraison se fait jusqu'à 6h am! Quand même..."}
{"text":"Best greasy (pre-millenial) pizza left in the hood; don't expect yet another Plateau hipster pizza! This place pre-dates all that. It's a remnant of what that neighbourhood was, (up to about 25 years ago), before the condos. The prices might have gone up a bit, but not much else has changed in this place."}
{"text":"First of all, when I called to order, I had to repeat multiple times my order to a grumpy old women who got annoyed with me. It gets worse. We ordered the shrimp pizza. A risky decision but we went for it AND OMFG IT WAS HORRIBLE. The shrimp (obviously frozen) even smelled very bad; It had that old seafood, rubber, grimy taste to it that almost made me gag. The cheese also was very plasticky. The only part that was good was the sauce. Overall, SUPER SHITTY PIZZA and the delivery guy got pretty angry and muttered some words (obscenities) that were pretty audible when I didn't have enough money to give him a good tip for an overpriced $30 pizza.   Delivery guy: 0.5/10 Food: 2/10 SO BAD   NEVER ORDERING HERE AGAIN."}
