{"text":"What a find! Stopped in for a late lunch had the special pork bun. Unlike any pork bun I have had - truly delicious and memorable. They have managed successfully to fuse Asian with American style food. Ultimate freshness and quality at an amazing price, truly I would have paid double for the pork bun. My friend had the crispy salmon salad which was cooked to perfection sitting on a swish of puréed beet which tasted fresher than fresh. The chef has to be applauded for his/her plating and whimsical presentation."}
{"text":"We had lunch at this restaurant today, it was two minutes walk from our hotel. We ordered Earl Grey Chai Latte, Braised Pork belly rice,  Brown Miso sauce pasta with vegetables, Kimchi Bao. My pasta was not as described, it had white sauce & very few peas & couple pieces of pumpkin, not worth $10.99. The rest was good."}
{"text":"The servers are very friendly, the food is really creative and delicious, and the bubble tea is great. Really cute restaurant that is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Relatively new place. Staff is incredibly helpful. The braised pork is one of the more interesting things I've had, and the lattes are delicious"}
{"text":"Great afternoon breakfast spot. Also happens to be Taiwanese. Prices were between $4.50-$10 per meal. Food came pretty fast. Our matcha milk teas came in huge mugs. Place is clean. Nothing really else like this in the immediate neighborhood."}
{"text":"Incredible food, great service, Artistic plating. A absolute must-go for lunch in Montreal. Crisp ingredients and flavors create a real party for your tastebuds and the service is super friendly and helpful. Frothy iced green tea was quite a treat as well. Awesome."}
{"text":"Genuine taste of bubble tea. The lemonade yogurt flavour is fresh & delightful. I've tried many places around the city, SEA and Australia and let me tell you it's my favourite. Service is warm & easygoing."}
{"text":"Came here for some tea located a block within the condo we were staying in while visiting Montreal. The teas are served cold and were delicious! I'm glad we stumbled upon this place. I really enjoyed their tea. The owner also was very friendly. He did everything from making the tea, serving, cleaning.. That's pretty awesome. He explained all the ingredients that were in each item. Then at the end he gave us a sample of hot tea he is planning on putting out in the cold winter. Also very tasty!"}
{"text":"They just opened recently so everything is not set and stable yet but you won't be disappointed by their food! I've tried their egg benedict and croissant on their pre-opening and it was actually really good. I love how they put their time in presenting it. I have also tried their yogurt green tea and I love it! Since the staffs just started they lack a bit of skills in service but they are really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is excellent and teas are very good too. Come here if you want a relaxing and enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"The one and only dish I ordered, brown butter miso pasta, I've thought about quite oven and it's been a month. Simply delicious. I would try everything on the menu. Excellent staff as well, one gentleman walked me through the chef's process and the nuances of each of the noodle dishes. Great food, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the attentive service at Le MajesThe. The server explained the whole menu to us when we were seated and recommended a few dishes. They are trying to fusion italian with taiwanese which is interesting. I had a chicken spaghetti with tomato sauce and poached egg. I love poach egg on anything. I enjoyed the spaghetti which had a slightly sweet flavour to it. Portions are on the small side but the prices are not too steep. The bubble tea is served in mason jars which is always fun. They have a good collection of teas which you can have with jelly or bubbles."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place is amazing. 

I really really really love their drinks. I tried the earl grey tea latte, and I love strong earl grey flavor !! I also had the brown sugar milk tea, which is really good too, and I appreciate that their drinks aren't too sweet. My favorite drink though is the yogurt green tea drink - it tastes like a combination of the yakult yogurt drink and green tea, and it's super refreshing and delicious !!!  

Food wise, I tried their brown butter miso pasta, which is super tasty! Presentation is beautiful (for all you instagrammers), and the flavors blend together so well. You can tell the chefs put a lot of thought and effort behind their dishes. 

The service is super friendly, and prices are reasonable. Everything on their menu looks so good - I can't wait to come back to try their brunch and desserts !"}
{"text":"Taste good. But we were there a little bit too late maybe. All rice food have been sold out. But it's still a good place to have a Taiwanese food. Love the milk tea."}
{"text":"When you want to sooth your Taiwanses/Asian stomach but you are on a budget. I had braised pork with rice - huge portion! taste was satisfying! Reasonable and affordable price (students friendly!) Very simple and low-budget interior design if you don't mind. Ideal place for students to study or hang out."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and keep forgetting to check in, so I'll try to give this overdue review the justice it deserves. 

This Taiwanese fusion place is a little gem of a restaurant that honestly deserves so much more recognition. Though it's already relatively well known and quite busy around meal times, the staff keep their service top quality. Food can be ready in 10 minutes if you know what you want to order - and we always do - 
and once they've even been kind enough to help us get us in and out the door in 20 minutes when we were in a rush. I always see the same few staff, and I have never had any problems here. 

As for food, it's already rare enough to find somewhere that serves both heathly and delicious meals; at Masjesthé, they've somehow manage to make them well-priced as well. We always order the pork belly rice, which is super flavourful, and the veggies always have something special about them that's hard to recreate at home. I usually don't usually drink sweet teas, but when I choose to get one here, it's been good every time. The portions are good and leave you comfortably full. Masjesthé has without doubt secured itself in my list of restaurants that keep me coming back again and again (and again). 

P.S. for McGill students - they take the MCSS discount card for 10% off!"}
{"text":"Small, cafeteria style restaurant with great Asian fusion. No alcohol. More of a lunch venue. Bao was very tasty. Rice bowl could have had some veggies. Presentation excellent. Earl grey dessert lovely."}
{"text":"Love their pastas. Best in town according to me. And the price is pretty decent for what you get. Very friendly staff and ambience. Would recommend and visit frequently. :)"}
{"text":"Camr back after they moved. They have new items on the menu. We tried the karaage, krabby patty bao, pork rice, curry omurice, black sesame creme brulee and a tieguanying latte. 

The karaage was delicious and had a special taste vs the normal ones. The latte was amazing and had a very nice tea aroma. The creme brulee was quite special but didn't have much black sesame taste. The other 3 dishes weren't very impressive and were a bit too salty for us. I cringed a little while eating the soft shell crab bao. I thought they would cut the crab in pieces but it came as a whole crab inside the bao and it felt like there was a huge red spider in it. 

The staff were very nice and friendly and the service was quite fast. The place feels much bigger than the old one. Would definitely come back for the karaage and the tea."}
{"text":"Family owned establishment. Super attentive service, central location. Ordered Quinoa salad which was  great, but small portions for the price. I enjoyed traditional Taiwanese bubble tea."}
{"text":"I only had their Oolong bubble tea. They have wide range of flavours for bubble milk tea. I was very confused about what to take because I dont know what tea leaf i would like. I went for the Oolong bubble milk tea, i was not disappointed. Service is also friendly"}
{"text":"This was an amazing place. It had a very nice quiet relaxing atmosphere, almost more of a coffee shop setting. We were seated immediately and our food came out extremely quick. Prices were very reasonable and portions were very generous. And not to mention delicious! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The staff are extremely friendly and happy to explain every item's ingredients, flavors, and preparation. Their recommendations are spot on whether or not you have experience with Asian/Taiwanese food. The food is a rare true fusion of Taiwanese, Asian, and Western meals that really works. And it's all fresh. The various tea drinks, like the meals, have distinct flavors that are refreshing and fun. There are a lot of boba tea places in the US and Canada, but they don't usually make everything fresh and so well. The restaurant itself is spotless and done in pleasant shades of light blue and green with patches of grass scatters on walls and shelves. The prices are better than reasonable considering the portion sizes and quality. We have added this to our list of culinary spots that will bring us back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in Montreal

The pork belly bao \"Gua Bao\" is the best thing on the menu. 

Those two things alone are worth coming for."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Service: 5/5

Arguably, I'm biased for fun fusion drinks, but I greatly enjoyed the drinks even though the taste was not the most palatable. It was enjoyable and good, but nothing especially subtle or amazing. I got the galaxy calipco drink (too sour!) and the oolong milk tea (very good!). Overall, I enjoyed the food as an experience.

Ambiance looks nice but feels cheap. Floor seems oily or dirty.

Service is friendly and nice. Very chatty."}
{"text":"Excelent creative dishes and great service. Hope to go back soon and try more. The rice bowls and pasta dishes we had were on point."}
{"text":"Went to Majesthé for a quick lunch with my girlfriends. Place is small but just perfect for a get together to chit chat. As mentioned by others, we had to guess the place as there was no sign indicating the restaurant's name. 
Menu had a small variety of choice but all seems special with a little touch of Asian fusion (ie Chinese sausage with an egg Benedict). I ordered the small bowl braised porc with rice. The flavours were delicious especially with the runny egg yolk mixed with the rice, made it super tasteful. The only thing is there is too much rice vs garnish on top. Could only eat half of it! I also had their hot winter melon latte, and i loved it!!! 
My friends ordered the egg Benedict and were disappointed by the small portion size but concluded at the end that the main meal plus the hot latte is just perfect. We were so full when we left."}
{"text":"A great place for fusion food! In my experience, most of the plates are pretty unique, which is worth trying. However, some of the dishes are nothing special (like the ramen or the tofu bao). A few plates also seem overpriced, like the bubbletea ice-cream and the extra portions that come with some of the dishes. 

The non-alcoholic drinks come in a very large size, so it's worth the price. I've tried the lingonberry galaxy and the matcha/oolong latte. The drinks aren't too sweet if you choose the right amount of sugar, which is great. 

The service was pretty good. Because they've just reopened, most of the servers are still unfamiliar with the program they're using. But they're all very understanding and nice, so I'm sure it'll get better."}
{"text":"I discovered this place thanks to Yelp and was excited to try it on my recent trip to Montreal. It did not disappoint.

I would describe the food as Western brunch with an Eastern twist. I had the Eggs Benedict $9.99 and my husband had the Quinoa Salad $5.99.

My Eggs Benedict was poached eggs on an English muffin with bacon, Chinese sausage (lap xuong), radishes, and green onions, covered in Hollandaise sauce. The eggs were perfectly poached with runny yolks. My complaint with the bacon is that it was really fatty (like fattier than most bacon that I've had). The English muffin was perfectly toasted. The Hollandaise sauce was ok, I've had better, but it wasn't bad. I loved the sweetness of the lap xuong and I liked the east meets west fusion flavours.

I had a taste of my husband's quinoa salad and it was great. I loved the dressing, which was a Miso and rice vinegar dressing. It had puffed rice and crunchy kale chips sprinkled on top which added nice texture (I'm all about the different textures when it comes to salads). It also had cabbage, grape tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers, and of course, quinoa. It was great, I wished I had ordered it. 

Service was nice and attentive for a café. The server refilled our waters when we were running low. 

The place is cute. It's a bit small and seats maximum 30, most of which are along the bar.

There is no sign on the storefront to tell you the name of the place. The existing sign (at the time of the writing of this review) is a blacked out Sushi Shop sign (!). Come on guys, get a real sign!  

Overall, a really cute place for brunch/lunch."}
{"text":"Tea is one of my absolute favorite things in life!  So, when I happened upon Le MajesThe while visiting Montreal for the first time, I had to try it.  I had already eaten, so I haven't tried the food.  However, there is a pork belly bao dish that I want to try in the future.  

The drink I decided to order was the Oolong Latte with boba served warm.  It was delicious! They give you options of how much sugar you would like in the beverage from no sugar to high.

I will definitely revisit before I leave Montreal."}
{"text":"They are awesome and great customer service!!!!! High quality, dedicated and creative delicious food. A must come store!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The only 2 questions that matter are: \"Would I come back?\" and \"Why/why not?\"


I would come back, and here's why.

The setting:
Once you step into the restaurant, it's easy to understand why Le Majesthé would be perfect for: 
   * Catching up with friends on a Tuesday evening
   * Bringing a date on a Saturday afternoon (not for the first date though) 
   * Going for a brunch on a Sunday \"morning\"
The vibe is laid back. The turquoise-colored walls and the wooden tables and chairs are cute. It's a perfect chilling spot (plus, it's not too far from the metro).

The food: 
I placed an order for a bowl of braised pork rice and a jar of winter melon bubble tea. Scroll down, and look at that bowl of braised pork rice, and scroll back up. Yup, that's right, it looks delicious, doesn't it? I don't use this line often, but it actually tastes better than it looks. I know I cultivate a non-bs attitude, but I want to make my description as graphic as possible here. Please excuse the use of some flowery poetry in my description.

As you begin to mix your rice with your chopsticks, magic happens. That warm runny yolk oozes like liquid gold, onto a bed of short grain rice, which does a terrific job of soaking up all the juices from the braised pork. Are you ready for the explosion of umami? I sure wasn't. 

On the other hand, I wasn't a big fan of the winter melon bubble tea. The sweetness was overbearing, and something about it tasted artificial. I do have to point out that the waitresses suggested not going for any added sugar, as the drink was sweet enough by itself. I regretted my #challenge accepted\" mentality."}
{"text":"They finally reopened after moving from their old location! 

Their food is always good! It's asian food with a little twist of western in it! The bao was tasty.
I also had their charcoal beef rice. The sauce was good and the beef was good quality. A little pricey, but it's for the quality. One thing about it was that it wasnt hot enough. The rice was warm but not hot. I think it could taste better if it was hotter.

I had wintermelon lemonade in Asia. And ever since, ive been trying to find one similar here in Montreal. At MajesThé, its the only place where it taste the same! It was so good! Will definitely go back just for this drink!"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of the previous MajesThé location. In my visits to the new location, I've been quite disappointed.

The tea is still delicious. A solid four (plus) stars.

The food is less consistent and balanced than before. From a personal standpoint, certain staples I liked are missing from the new menu. More objectively, in my most recent visit, the chicken kimchi bao was short on both chicken and kimchi, and quite heavy on mayonnaise and barbecue sauce. My quinoa salad was so overdressed that it resembled porridge. I struggled to finish it. Two stars at best.

Service was scattered and unprofessional. It took 35 minutes to receive a salad and bao--for carry out. In the waiting period, customers were scarcely acknowledged, and two left after they were seated but had not been able to order. Dirty dishes remained on tables without being bussed or wiped. There was no organization in table numbering or server zoning, and many dishes came from the kitchen and servers had to ask patrons at each table if they had ordered it or not. The two servers were not proactive, attentive, and were occasionally dismissive to the patrons. One star, perhaps none.

Customers visit a restaurant for the food and drink; they return based on their experience with the product and service. If this were my first experience, I would not return. As it is, I may only return for the delicious milk tea."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for a brunch. You can have eggs Benedict or some egg croissant with some Asian touch Middle of the day if desired. It's a very small but cute place.  I tried the eggs Benedict and it was light and tasty but I wouldn't call it outstanding. They also have some iced tea creations that are pretty yummy.

Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We had the ham croissant, egg Benedict, green tea lemonade and earl grey latte. Everything was great. Like the earl grey latte a lot!! The size of the drink is also quite generous!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with very cute decor. Came in for lunch on a weekday and got the Braised Pork Rice and a Yogurt Green Tea with bubbles in it. Presentation of the food was superb, and it tasted as good as it looked. The runny sous-vide egg and pork floss combined with the braised pork gave the rice so much flavour! I had also never had Yogurt Green Tea before, and I'd have to say that it was a great surprise! Didn't know how much I would like the sweet, creamy taste of yogurt combined with the slight bitterness of green tea.

Overall, I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Their miso butter pasta and tea lattes are seriously amazing. In fact, tea lattes are my new favourite summer drink because of this place. I love that the teas are all homemade and taste really fresh because it's not just a flavoured-powder like what is used in some other places. Also their staff is very attentive and they will even do a demonstration if you get the unicorn tea drink (can't remember the correct name). I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Pork belly rice and karaage rice bowl were too greasy for me,but chicken was tender and well marinated. The side dish with karaage tasted too creamy. I preferred som"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because they just opened, but man this place is clean (Keep it up). I find the green accents quite complementary and fitting for their emphasis on teas in their drinks menu. 

I came here after being quite stuffed from dimsum and wanted to grab some tea to go. I was given a sample of their matcha and earl grey lattes. Both were excellent and packed a great punch of flavour. You can definitely tell they don't skimp out on the use of real tea leaves in their drinks. 

Their Grey Trio dessert was quite the treat. Presentation was stunning and thumbs up on the different layers of flavours and textures.

Food wise: I don't think what I had was on the menu, but it basically consist of what I believe is some very well seasoned pork and a nice sunny side up egg on a bed of rice. A wonderful concoction for hungry people like me who can never get full at Izakayas.  

**If you like bubble tea and would like something that has a much more substantial tea taste than something you would get at Chatime, come here! LOOVEEEE THEIR YOGURT GREEN TEA! (My childhood in a cup)**

Note: Since it's still within their fresh opening stage, they're constantly trying to inject more creativity in their menu. The owners really take into consideration the feedback from customers so that's much appreciated!"}
{"text":"LOOVE this place! I will definitely come back for their Taiwanese sausage, the taste is authentic and you know that a lot attention was given to the presentation (braid-like layered presentation just for a sausage!) 

Definitely try their braised pork rice bowl! It is delicious and I loved the runny egg on top! Their miso pasta is also great! Owner is really chill, and even offered us some green tea yogurt because of a little delay.

Also lovely decor and happy jazz music to put you in a better mood!"}
{"text":"Little Taiwanese shop opened up with a small menu but pretty good fare. Tried the pork bowl and had some drinks. The service is friendly and the waiter brought us some tiny sample drinks to taste test and were pretty good! I would go back to try more things. It's more of a lunch type place or if you want to go for a bubble tea or want the Asian drinks menu options."}
{"text":"This place provides a twist on familiar comfort foods. While there is heavy Taiwanese, Italian, and French influences, the mood of the place largely feels like a bright and airy bubble tea shop, with a college hangout vibe. Their creative menu offers a hearty meal at affordable prices and it feels like a comfortable a place you can linger to enjoy their delicious creamy lattes. The food was also plated beautifully, which was a pleasant surprise for a place with a casual vibe.

Among their entrees, we tried the butternut avec carbonara and the braised pork with rice. We also had the Earl Grey and matcha tea lattes. 

We really enjoyed the butternut avec Carbonara. It featured a creamy but light butternut squash purée, peas, mascarnpone, pancetta, and unexpectedly, Chinese sausage. It was garnished with green onion and slices of radish. We were not sure how the Italian and Chinese influences would play together, but the flavors blended well. 

The braised pork with rice had ground bits of marinated pork, shredded dried pork (it's a Chinese thing), and a seven-spice mayonnaise. It was topped with a poached egg that you break and mix in, like a bibimbap but instead as a fried rice. The flavor was delicious, sweet mellow blend of soy sauce and sake. We had hoped the dish would have more vegetables to provide some contrast and additional texture. At the time of this review, it is the only rice dish they feature, so if you're in the mood for that, (or looking for something gluten free), it's a filling and satisfying choice.

The teas were some of our favorite lattes experience so far in Montreal. (We we were visiting from NYC.) They seem to put a lot of thought into their drinks. First of all, their lattes are made with a base of brewed tea,  not some syrup or powder mix. The matcha latte is made with Japanese matcha and brewed Chinese tea. The Earl Grey has a wonderfully balanced richness and fragrance of bergamot, black tea, milk and sugar. Speaking of sugar, they offer different levels of sweetness options, which is a revelation. I find most cafe drinks way too sweet and candy-like, and the Le Majesthe lattes were perfect."}
{"text":"Hidden gem Asian fusion Taiwanese place near McGill!

The day we went they had a special sushi/kimbap dish with pork belly and kimchi. It was SO GOOD. Pork belly + kimchi + rice combination can't go wrong for me. I hope they add it to their permanent menu.

For a main meal, I had the butternut squash pasta. It was soooo creamy! I've never had anything like it at other places and the candied bacon is a good compliment to the creaminess.

My friend had the pork floss rice bowl minus the poached egg. I've had it last time I visited and it was really good too, but nothing will beat the butternut squash pasta. 

The ONLY complaint I have is that the portions are not that big compared to other places, but the uniqueness of the dishes honestly make up for it.

9.5/10!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and find it overpriced. The grilled beef rice has 5 slices of meat on top of a bowl of rice for 15 dollars. After tax and tip it's 20 dollars for 5 slices of meat... I think it's way overpriced.

Be prepared to pay for the decoration and atmosphere. I didn't try their bubble tea but I saw them using generic stuff from big jars that you can buy from any Asian market."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in downtown montreal. Good environment/aura and a cozy place to spend the time. Food is absolutely delicious, and the milk teas are the best in town. (way better than chatime or other places). 
The only thing i could recommend is for them to have the option to add more noodles for the pasta dishes (I don't mind pay a few more dollars)."}
{"text":"Food: they serve comfort food. We ordered the famous Braised Pork Rice and Japanese curry rice. They were all pretty good. The japanese curry was a bit on the plain side...the flavour didn't   show as much as it should be. As for the Braised pork rice, i really like the running egg in the middle of the bowl. It gives a good texture to the rice and goes well with the braised pork. We had the panna cotta for dessert. Not to sweet, jello kind of texture with matcha crumble, pearls and berries.

Environment: The staff were nice and friendly. 
Great cozy place for a casual dinner with your friends. 

 Overall, I enjoyed my experience and will come back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Ordered limonade green tea, braised pork rice bowl, the Japanese curry rice and panna cotta with tapioca pearl.

The food was good overall. Surprisingly,the dessert was my favourite part. That panda cotta has this chewing texture. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was casual. It reminds me of Opiano whereas lots students come for a casual meal with friends.

This is a place that I would go to have a simple meal with my friends."}
{"text":"Been here twice and food was consistent and delicious both times. 
They pay lots of attention to their food, from flavours to plating. The menu is small, and every component is described. They use sous vide to cook some of their items like the egg and chicken breast, so definitely innovative!
Highly recommend the braised pork rice, was a little too soggy the second time around. They also have special menu items like the pork bun that came out recently, which I found better than most restaurants that serve the Asian fusion style of steamed buns. (See photo)
The bubble tea was standard, but not bad nonetheless. 
The atmosphere is clean and comfortable, feels open even in the small restaurant."}
{"text":"Taiwanese fusion food here and everything we ordered was so good! This was our first stop after driving in Montreal and it was perfect because it was located just a few blocks from our hotel. We started with the dumpling app, which isn't a dumpling at all but a traditional Taiwanese glutinous dish and it was very good. I really enjoyed my minced pork rice dish and everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. We also got to sample their green tea lemonade and oolong milk tea, which were both very good. We all enjoyed our drinks of wintermelon tea lemonade and earl grey milk tea. We wanted to come back to get tea another day but never got the chance to because it was closed for an event."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant. I went there for lunchtime and got myself a bowl of rice topped with pork. It was quiet for lunch time, so we were seated right away. Service was fairly quick also. 

As the name implies, this place is more focused on drinks more than anything else. Unfortunately, I was short of change and being more hungry than thirsty, I opted for a meal instead than a drink. The price was fair for the amount of food we received. The flavors themselves, however, were not diverse enough and kinda bland at times. But the flavors present were enough to leave me with a good impression overall. Worth the 3 stars

Will return back another time for drinks, and maybe a bump in rating?"}
{"text":"Food was only okay, plated nicely but taste was mediocre (mostly just carbs like rice and pasta)."}
{"text":"New location, but same great food! Loving some of the new menu items, like the Krabby Patty bao. Pork belly risotto is very tomato-y but actually complements the pork belly taste very well. As usual, the drinks are great. The beet fries are actually chunks of beet, fried, so I wouldn't recommend unless you rlly like beets. Overall still an excellent experience--the staff really care if you're in need of service and try their best despite how busy they are. I'm glad they moved to a bigger location!"}
{"text":"Dessert so good. Drink so delicious. Opened by young Taiwan entrepreneur Vincent. They are moving to new location in front of McGill. Must go destination"}
{"text":"This place is lovely--friendly and attentive staff, cozy ambience, great food. My friend and I visited Le Majesthe for the first time yesterday (I'd actually gotten a recommendation from Yelp yesterday morning and was so excited I insisted on trying it the same day). My friend ordered the pork rice and the winter melon lemonade and I got the vegetarian butternut squash pasta. Everything was delicious, and my friend said her drink brought her right back to her trip to Taiwan this summer. My only complaint is that my food was lukewarm when it was served. 
Lots of reviewers have recommended the tea lattes here, so we came back this afternoon to try them. We were offered samples of the Guan Yin tea latte, which was nice :) We ended up ordering the Guan Yin tea latte and the Earl Grey tea latte and both were excellent, although the Guan Yin is my favorite. I will definitely be back soon. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The most delicious food we've had in Montreal! Everything from the croissants to the dessert was yummy. The owner is the nicest guy and truly cares about his customers. The decor is also very clean and modern. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had the pork belly rice and the gochujang kimchi pasta for dinner, and a black sesame Crème Brule for dessert . Both entrees were delicious and devoured quite quickly, similar with the dessert. We had samples of their teas and would highly suggest trying their teas as well."}
{"text":"Clean. Simple.Full of real flavor.

The only thing missing is it doesn't have any banner from ouside- and it's located below a Pizzeria. So it creates confusion at the beginning.

But as long as you see Asians (full of) you know, ypure entering the correct Fusion restaurant.

Plus, the service is also 5star."}
{"text":"Was definitely expecting a lot better based on the good reviews.

Our visit started out okay, trying one of the pork buns. The meat was a little dry and the bun didn't taste that great but it was tolerable. And then the noodle dishes came out. Oh boy.

The sauce is watery, the meat is verrrry  scarce, and the noodles tasted just like the kind you buy at a supermarket and then boil up for a quick meal when you don't have time to make actual food. It all kind of felt like a uni student had made what they thought was a good dish and then served it to you.

Service was friendly though and they gave out some latte samples while we were there which were quite good (matcha-flavored I believe), so who knows, maybe the good reviews are based on those elements. All I can advise is skip the noodles and maybe just grab a drink instead."}
{"text":"The pork bun is highly recommended. It comes with delicious pork belly. 

However, I do not recommend the braised pork rice. It's too wet. Also, I didn't get enough pork."}
{"text":"As a bubble tea lover. This place is my best bubble tea l've had in Montreal. I'm so glad I got to try this bistro. We walk-in for a takeout, the staffs are very friendly, I didn't have to wait long for my order. The place looks very clean and modern. I ordered 2 different flavour of bubble tea, I can said they have the best tea quality in Montreal. I definitely want to try all the flavours  they had on the menu, because it seems they use good quality ingredients (which is very important for me). You can also choose the sugar level and amount of ice, I love it!!

This place is great! I highly recommended."}
{"text":"Quiet bubble tea place on President-Kennedy street.  Hot bubble tea is served in bowl mugs with frothy milk on top. Tapioca pearls are only $0.50 extra.  We asked for sugar on the side so we could adjust to taste ourselves. 

I ordered the Taiwanese sausages and they were quite filling, affordable and very satisfying. Taiwanese sausages tend to be garlicky and slightly sweet tasting and when paired with scallions, spicy mayo, slivers of nori, paper thin radish slices and popped rice bits, it took satisfying to another level!  This is a great afternoon snack if you're looking for something savoury.  The staff is very pleasant and courteous."}
{"text":"Went back today and tried the pork gyoza dumplings which were delicious and were beautiful to look at as well. My friend had the chicken rice bowl but commented that there was very little chicken and too much rice."}
{"text":"Was happy to learn it is a fusion-Taiwanese restaurant.  Reviews were all pretty good...was a bit nervous to try... didn't want to be disappointed.  And I wasn't!!! One of the best pork belly boa (appetizer) ever! So generous in portion and quality filling nags and meat.  Their signature rice dish with minced pork was satisfying hit too! Tasty and beautifully presented with wooden bowl... size looked ok but actually a generous portion too! Was so full after!"}
{"text":"Great jazzy ambience, mixed with Asian cuisine. We had the Fried Chicken Karrage and then the Curry Omurice and my wife had the Pork Belly.  Great blend of spice and flavors.  Very tasty.
Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bubble tea in town - amazing food, great service, wonderful atmosphere, amazing owner... the list goes on! The alcoholic bubble tea is a must try too! 10/10 would bring my friends over again!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, great food, awesome drinks! Service was on the slower side, but this is definitely a nice place to chill and eat with friends. Really popular with young Asian students.

The pork belly bowl was amazing - melt in your mouth with all those delicious juices soaking into the rice. The traditional pork bowl was like lu rou Fan for you Taiwanese people out there. And it tasted pretty authentic! We also got the omurice, which was equally delicious.

A heads up on the rice dishes, there is a lot of rice and not enough of the meat! Perhaps that's my only complaint cause the pork belly was just so good.

Anyways, we also got the summer is coming alcoholic drink - it's yogurt, green tea, rum, and lychee jelly. Super yummy! You can't taste the alcohol at all. Also ordered the winter melon latte and that was sososo creamy. The aloe jelly we added was bomb. They don't carry their hot drink machine right now at their new location though. Just an FYI.

A great place to relax with friends and eat yummy food! Note that the sign to get in is just the crown. You have to walk down stairs to get to the door."}
{"text":"Went there today for brunch. I had the salmon croissant and it was delicious. Service was very nice and quick. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Awesome tea lattes with a chill ambiance too! Very clean, and the manager is very sweet and explains everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Seriously took 20 min before I was even offer some water. But I won't hold it against them bc I saw how busy they were.  I guess some staff called in sick bc the person that took my order isn't normally a waiter.

Karaage chicken bowl - a must. Really generous with their portions. Love the piled high, huge pieces of crispity crunchy chicken but would have appreciated a knife at times. I was alone but if you were on a date, I don't know if you'd want to show your savage animal side by tearing into some meat with your teeth.  Maybe you do.

Beet fries - lightly battered and fried everything is always on the top of my list.

Matcha Oolong bubble tea - they are serious about their boba tea here.  Cold but no ice and they fill it to the top of a liter sized beer mug. WTH???  Pass the 40.

So many other fantastic things on the menu. I couldn't decide. Will have to return for the baos."}
{"text":"Notre première visite après le déménagement! Resto bcp plus grand et ils ont ajouté des items au menu.

Nous avons pris le \"pork belly rice\" et le \"mighty chicken rice bowl\". Bonne portion. très bon mais à mon avis pas assez salés. On a essayé le thé au melon d'hiver et leur nouveau thé oolong au pomme et j'ai bien aimé les deux. Bon service comme d'habitude!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for a early lunch. 
This place isn't hard to find but they don't own a sign. Hanging a sign probably help the business. It is not a busy place for lunch so I would recommend people working in the nearby buildings to have lunch here since the service is fast and neat. They do have a relatively small menu. The price is inexpensive compared to the nearby underground food court which is so crowded during lunch time.

I had a pork rice. It comes with minced pork, floss, slow cooked egg and dry seaweed. The seaweed really lights up the meal. I didn't finish it because it came with too much rice. After I finished the toppings, only plain rice left. The slow cooked egg is also rare to see in an inexpensive restaurant. I can see their effort to provide people high quality dishes, but overall the rice is too dull for me.I did add some spicy sauce in it.
My friend had the first pasta with butternut squash. She liked it very much. The portion is just perfect. The sauce is full of flavor. I liked the pasta over my rice.
The tea latte was wonderful. i had a winter melon tea latte. Winter melon tea is a Taiwan traditional drink. Whenever I spotted it, I can't resist. It reminds me of the good old times. Give it a try if you like Asian food. Be assured it is good and mild.

Will bring my other friends to come and try other dishes."}
{"text":"While my friends and I spent the weekend in Montreal, we were really craving bubble tea and couldn't really find too many places in Montreal, until we came across Le MajesThe. 

To start off, the place was really cute and had a modern feel to it. The people who worked there were super friendly as well! My friends and I are always amazed when we see an Asian person speaking French so that was quite awesome as well haha. Anyways, let's get talking about the food! 

So we ordered the creamy mushroom pasta, carbonara with butternut squash, and liquid nitrogen earl grey ice cream. The creamy mushroom pasta was alright, the sauce was nice and creamy, but it lacked in flavour. I didn't try the carbonara with butternut squash, but my friend said it was plain/bland. Now I was extremely excited for the liquid nitrogen earl grey ice cream, but it was quite disappointing.. With liquid nitrogen ice cream, normally it comes out smoking, but not at Le MajesThe. The earl grey ice cream tasted really good, but just lacked that excitement of the liquid nitrogen smoke. In terms of the bubble tea, it was average compared to what I'm used to in Toronto. There wasn't much variety, but I will say that it came in cute mason jar cups. 

Overall, I'm not sure if there are better places to get bubble tea and food than here, but if there isn't, I would definitely check out this place. I kind of wish I had more time in Montreal as I would've liked to experienced more, but until next time Montreal."}
{"text":"Newly discovered this humble place in my neighborhood. I only have kind things to say about this restaurant. The staff is very polite, the food tasted as good as it looked, the desert was on point. I'm not a huge fan of deserts but those ones were perfectly not too sweet. Apparently it gets busy during school year, but since most university students are away during summer we were lucky the place wasn't bombarded with clients. Walking distance from my place, so I plan on visiting again very soon to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"()Everything on their menu are just awesome~from the wonderful dish decoration to the food quality, and especially with their lovely price, it's definitely worth it for a 5 stars

I've lived in Montreal for 10 years...I've never found any place with food that's sooooo delicious like this. Their fusion between Taiwanese and western food are just perfect. I'm sure every Asian or western people will like it. 

And honestly, their dishes decoration are magnificents, they definitely have a level comparative to Michelin standard. Every single dish looks like an artwork. And the taste is just great. I'm actually impressed when I first tried their food. It was way higher than what I expected. And this is why I keep going back to their place.

U won't find any reason to dislike this place~Favorite place ever~~"}
{"text":"The service is great.

As a tea room I would give them higher rating, but for food only, I say no more than 3.

The food looks beautiful on paper (menu), looks delicious in those photos, but the taste is disappointing in mouth.

Why? I think its because they focus on the look. Trying to make tea shop quickies into \"fusion\" cuisine but first of all fusion never works and second it's still tea shop food no matter what.

Let's look at the Taiwanese sausage. Store bought ones obviously, slice them up, put some pointless dressing on top, put it on one side of a dish, look nice. Tastes like its cooked in T&T.

Pork rice. Tiny bit of minced pork and pork floss, over an ocean of soggy white rice. Eww.

Pasta in fusion sauce, does not work.

It's all about presentation, presentation, presentation. But sorry to break the truth, it is boring as hell."}
{"text":"Very very good flavour 

I've had most of the appetisers, which were all very good, and the braised pork bowl. the braised pork bowl was amazing, loads of flavour and the dish is served with an egg on top that you pop and mix with the rice which is really neat 

the service was great and courteous 

it's a place I'd definitely come back to, my main concern is it's on the pricy side for the amount of food you're getting (considering my dish was mostly rice), but that's completely reasonable for the taste and quality"}
{"text":"Their foods are really healthy, they stay away from fried stuff. Most of the stuff are steam, boiled, bake and at the most pan-fried (dumplings). 

Food quality is okay, since it's healthy, you can't expect much on the flavour side. What's healthy is really hard to be tasty. It's just standard rules. 

Drink wise, we ordered their fancy lemonade. Galaxy Lemonade... Pretty.. But that's it. 

Overall is good. You should give them a try."}
{"text":"Great casual spot.. food was tasty. My neices loved the Galaxy Lemonade (changes color).. we enjoyed the eggs benny and pastas.. the Earl Grey Latte was a bit heavy handed on the lavender. Too bad we were too full for dessert..looked good too! :)"}
{"text":"This place is way too overrated!! I really want to love this small cozy restaurant but I have been there for three times since they opened and every time their service just drawn me down.. In my first visit, I ordered a veggie miso pasta and in the bowl, there's literally ONLY pasta and the sauce; no other ingredients! With this prices, I would expect some veggies in it or more toppings. Few days after my first visit, I went there to have a take up drink. Their waitress doesn't know what they were doing AT ALL. I asked for a yogurt green tea, no ice and half sugar with bubbles. The waitress asked: \"so you want it hot?\"   I really wanted ask her if she can a drink with yogurt in it hot.. and when I got my drink, there's no bubbles in it... So they took my drink and added the bubbles 
Today, I went with a friend and we both ordered the veggie squash pasta. When we got the pasta, halfway through our convo, we found out that there was bacon in it!!  we double check with the waitress and she thought we ordered the regular one when I initially specified that we wanted the vegetarian options..
I give it 2 starts just because that I can't deny that their drinks are decent within the reasonable prices,  it is also made up from the real tea not powder. But their waitresses need some training"}
{"text":"Located right next to Place des arts metro station, it is a small Asian bistro which has a really unique menu. Of course, it offers the typical Asian drinks like bubble tea, but the dishes are really a fusion of different countries cuisine and the gourmets are as delicious as aesthetic, since the plating is always extraordinary. I loved the braised pork bun on a piggy bowl and the matcha crumble with earl grey ice-cream, other choices on the menu sound very tempting too. Cannot wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Interesting twist on Asian food. Loved the casualty of the combination as well. It was very easy and comfortable place to go."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 bao apps (chicken and kimchi and braised pork), butternut squash carbonara and a ground pork bowl.  All the dishes were excellent.  The bao was spongy and the fillings were flavorful.  Our butternut squash carbonara was creamy and our pork bowl was well balanced with the rice and egg.  Overall, this place is a great place to get great combinations of flavor at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal! We got the Eggs Benedict and the Croissant Sandwich and truly enjoyed them both. We also had the Grey Trio desert and it was sublime. 

The wait staff was extremely friendly and I look forward to coming back the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I've been to the old location many times including when they first opened! Visited new location today!!
I wish all the other problems I had at the old location were resolved at the new place, but it was still the old ones, plus more. I've always had an issue with their consistency - eg. the braised pork rice was on point for me once, other times there's been issues with the ratio of rice and pork and sauce, and spicy-ness of the mayo. Sometimes food is quite good, other times not so much. Everyone has already commented on service at the new location; I'm sure it's going to improve with time. Also the beet fries really need a dipping sauce, i know it's coming soon but the poor beets on their own with the cornstarch coating is just sooo bland. The bao in the tofu bao was too sweet and too airy- would've preferred a more substantial/dense bao. 

On a side note about the new decor, not too sure who they collaborated with but there's an atmosphere of not-quite-there bougie-chic. Feels like they were going for a clean upscale French bistro vibe, but the space is missing its old charm and French charm. Maybe different lighting would help, the white interior pairs with white lights just is too sterile for a semi basement. 

Anyway it really sucks that I've had good experiences in the past. Now every time I go I have high hopes, only to find them not realized. Makes me wish I only had mediocre expectations to start with so I wouldn't be as disappointed at the end of my meal. 

Five stars for location though. It's even closer to McGill students now that it's on Robert Bourassa."}
{"text":"I heard that this place was a Taiwanese fusion, so I went and tried the place!

As I walked in, it was a very welcoming place, relaxing and adorable. It's a small place, so don't bring too many people with you! The menu is growing! The food is well done and very tasty. The price is fair and the drinks are better than Chatime's for sure! It's a cute place to have a cute meal and you cab even study here! They've just expanded their menu! Also, you can ask for some hidden orders ;)

p.s. this is an update done 4 months after it was 1st written, still 5 stars and even better! Getting better and better!!!"}
{"text":"We just tried this restaurant in its new location. The new place is bigger and still just as clean. The service is friendly. 

We tried the traditional bao, omurice, braised pork rice and chicken karaage, pork belly rice. I would definitely order the first three again. The bao is pretty big, so if you aren't too hungry, it's a good size. I loved the omurice as well.The pork belly rice is a little fatty for me, but it may just be what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Had the \"Krabby Patty\" Bao & Tonkutsu Ramen which were both great.  I've read other reviews that commented on the high price, but surprised me as I had quite the opposite opinion.  I mean, free would be nice, but for the quality I thought the place could bump up prices a bit (but please don't, its part of the reason for the 5-star review).  So much to choose from on the menu that I'm temptedI to go back tomorrow night to try something else, and consider the validity of the negative 'consistency' comments in some reviews; I've been once so I'm not qualified to say."}
{"text":"I visited again and feel the need to do a refresh because I think that the first time, I was dazzled more by the great prices than the actual food quality.

On my second visit, I ordered the brown butter miso pasta, the Earl Grey latte, and the pork belly bao. 

The pork belly bao was a-ok. The bun was a touch harder/less fluffy than their competitors, but the pork was tender and tasted good. The latte was just fine.

The miso was an enormous letdown, and I should have known because I was told so by a colleague who brought all his friends here one night - great prices, nice presentation, decent appetizers, awful mains.

I could have sworn the pasta order they gave me was creamy mushroom instead of brown butter miso. It was creamy (and slightly clotted), with mushroom slices throughout. It was also extremely bland. I can't emphasize how bland it was. There was no flavour to it at all, let alone the distinct flavours of brown butter and miso. I asked about it and the servers insisted it was the right dish, which leads me to conclude that it's just not good, as opposed to a mistake. I took two bites and didn't have any more - and I normally hate wasting food.

When my bill came, they didn't bat an eye at my virtually untouched pasta. After I paid - and I was charged full price - they offered to switch my main to something else to see if I'd like it better, and I decided not to. It was cold and rainy and I just wanted something reliably good. I ended up getting some fish tacos to go from La Habanera. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"J'aime la simplicité de l'endoit et de la bouffe , sans pretention mais bonne quand meme, big bowl of tea :)"}
{"text":"Doesn't recommend this restaurant at all. The foods are fine but the service is awful. We spend around 2 hours for the lunch, half an hour to eat the meal and the rest of one and half hour is just waiting for the dessert and waiting for the waiters to come. 
Won't come next time, the service needs to improve."}
