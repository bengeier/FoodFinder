{"text":"Food was just okay, and service was slow.

We waited for an hour, even though we could see at least three open tables the whole time we waited from the bar.

Duck-fat fries were bland.  Complimentary bread was cold and hard, but the accompanying kalamata olive aioli was great.

Prime rib was okay, but again not great.  The accompanying potatoes au-gratin were bland bland bland and gritty.

Fried chicken was also rather bland, and the accompanying mac-n-cheese was dry.

The highlight was 1/2 ounce of complimentary kalamata olive aioli with the cold bread before the meal.  Everything else was mediocre.

Bland."}
{"text":"This is a favorite place to go for A Thanksgiving holiday brunch. The food does not disappoint.. My favorite was the first course selection of roasted Brussel salad. I had melt to your mouth filet mignon and a some very moist and tasty turkey. The green beans with mushrooms were seasoned perfectly, as well as the mashed and sweet potatoes. The dessert selection was abundant and delicious.  We were greeted by very friendly staff as soon as we walked in. Our server, Emmerrel (may have spelling wrong) was very attentive, quick and friendly. He conveyed a genuine interest in providing excellent service. This is a tradition that will continue, without a doubt. I love the holiday decor inside and out."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a working lunch. Devoured the crab cake BLT, tortilla soup and dessert caddy. Atmosphere and ambience were relaxed and calming. Love the open kitchen concept. Service by Lisa was top notch as well!"}
{"text":"This was such an amazing surprise to our trip out to Arizona. We stayed at the Biltmore and decided to try Frank & Alberts for our first breakfast and never went anywhere else.

My husband and I eat organically, so it was a delight to actually find a REALLY good restaurant that offers these options for people like us. The staff was absolutely delightful! They remembered our names, gave us exceptional service, and really made the whole experience just wonderful. The chef also came out and paid us a visit, which is always good in my book as you are never able to give the proper compliments to their hard work.

For breakfast, definitely try the eggs benedict! Their twist on it was a unique delight for someone who is an eggs benedict lover. They use a smoked pork loin vs a ham and their hollindaise was to die for!

For dinner, definitely try the bass. For cocktails, you MUST try the Lavender and Lemons martini. Lavender infused vodka with lemonade and candied violets.

The only thing I would request that they improve is their desserts. Two people in our party had their cherries jubilee and the bananas foster. Both felt more like ice cream with fruit vs the traditional (or even modified) application. It was a bit of a disappointment, but overall we were extremely pleased with this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  We stayed at the Biltmore over Christmas with an all-inclusive package.  With this package we were able to try a large variety of items on the menu.  The staff was incredibly friendly and recognized us by the 2nd day.  The first day we started off with the smashed avocados.  Great flavor - def not boring!  We also tried the pulled pork empanadas.  Not too much flavor, but not bad either.  During our stay we tried the pizza (late night and the pie was HUGE), the Burger (awesome taste) and the chicken and goat cheese flat.  All were very well prepared and had great flavor.  So maybe the reason the cheese pizza was incredible was because it was after cocktails, but really not bad for a resort.

Definitely need to try the FF prepared in duck fat.  We tried this one and the sea salt fries.  They were both good, but the duck fat fries had just that little something extra.

We ate Christmas dinner at F&A's also.  Very good again.  The best part was the table-side smores!  

Overall our experiences were wonderful!  Even though most of our meals were eaten here, there is still more on the menu I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Nice place great food and service. We could definitely taste the quality in which the food has being hormone free meats and local farmed vegetables. The wheat germ crunch pancakes did not suck at all. I can't wait to enjoy the buffet on Sunday. Definitely go here if you like well cooked and clean tasting foods."}
{"text":"We often stop in or bring friends to Frank and Alberts, specifically for their fabulous peach Bellini.  While we aren't typically keen on frozen drinks, we have celebrated many occasions sipping on the frozen, peachy deliciousness.  Today we stopped in with a friend after a long bike ride.  When we found out they were out of a key ingredient, we were crestfallen.  Our server, Lisa, went the extra mile to seek out the missing ingredient elsewhere in the resort so she could serve us our favorite Bellinis!  Thanks again, Lisa!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a casual dinner on the patio with great wine, excellent service and unique menu of tasty food. 

The scallops were really good and so was the chicken Parmesan.


We also liked the personal attention provided by our waiter.  He did not rush us and shared some interesting facts about the hotel.

If you are visiting the Biltmore I would highly recommend enjoying dinner here."}
{"text":"It's a very nice atmosphere. The food is good. The Service is very good. The Biltmore is an amazing place and I think was looking for amazing. I had the chicken and goat cheese flat bread which was great. The next day I had their version of a French dip also very good."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Food, Great Atmosphere, Just GREAT.

You must try the smoked tomato soup.  I have started trying to make this at home.  The butternut squash ravioli are superb.  The veggie pizza sublime.

And, if you want to treat yourself to dessert at the start of the meal, go for the so amazing Onion Rings.  You will come back and back for this (I did.  I live in NY and as soon as I landed in town, I got in the car and came back for an order.)

Make sure you wonder around the hotel!!  If you have the chance, sit in the back room next to the fireplace.  Perfect thing to do on a chilly January night."}
{"text":"This is a review of Happy Hour only. 

First let me say, I went with a large group of about 30 people, and our waitress did an awesome job! She put everyone on their own checks, and was super efficient, so I would definitely return if only for that reason. The atmosphere is nice and the chairs are comfortable, and they even have a few booths. 

The drink specials for their specialty cocktails are the best deal, they are all around $5. The Prickly Peartini is probably one of the best drinks I have ever had, it was not too sweet and not too tart, just delicious and refreshing. The reason I only give them 3 stars is the food, I just wasn't blown away. They have these appetizer boards where you pick 4 options out of a list of 8 items, and each board is $5. Sounds good right? Well, the choices sound delicious, but the portion sizes are very, very small, these boards are not meant to be shared. I selected the potato skin for one of my options, and I was expecting a standard size skin that you normally get at a restaurant, but that is not what I got. My potato skin was maybe 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long, it was the smallest potato skin I have ever seen! It is like they used a scrap peel from a potato to make it. While it was good, but potato + cheese + bacon isn't hard to mess up, I really feel I got a bit of the shaft. I also tried the meatloaf slider (decent, but needed a sauce) the grilled cheese bite (dry bread and nonexistent cheese) and the tomato soup shooter (really smoky, I didn't even finish it). 

While I think the concept is good, the appetizer boards are all looks and no substance. Some of the other people at the table ordered the Chicken Lollipops, the baked brie and the onion rings, which were also just $5 per plate and looked to be really good and better portioned. I would definitely give Frank & Albert's a try again, but I would steer clear of the appetizer boards."}
{"text":"Just didn't do it for me. The food was bland and overpriced. I had a better meal at the Cheesecake Factory at the Biltmore Fashion Park."}
{"text":"We used to LOVE going to Frank and Albert's for dinner.  They used to have a grilled chicken, and braised braised beef ribs to die for, but alas, no more.  I ordered the Shepards Pie which was so salty it was  inedible.  My friend ordered the meatloaf. Ditto. I don't know why they removed  two simple items from their menu that were not spicy, esoteric, and delicious. I'm sorry they changed their menu.  We won't be going back.  Please note: their wait staff was as pleasant as usual."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Waldorf for a conference and ended up eating at Frank and Alberts several times. First: if you have a Gluten Allergy, the place is AWESOME.  They have great gluten free bread and pizza crust.  The staff is wonderful and the food is very, very good.   You can eat inside or out which this time of the year is a nice bonus!   If you go, get Ines (pronounced E-nes) to make you a chocolate mocha!  They are as divine as her service!!!  Overall, A+!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food in a beautiful venue. Nothing not to like (well perhaps price, but you don't go to this restaurant for a cheap date!)"}
{"text":"Very bad experience.....had a reservation for a specific table outside for a month, called twice to confirm as it was a special birthday event. When we, a party of six arrived, our table was taken. 
The food was average at best.....very disappointed!"}
{"text":"So we tried this for a second time for New Years because the first year the service, food and experience was awful. This year was actually worst than last. The prime rib was awful, my guests shrimp were not cooked, service was sub par and the GM who I complained didn't really care. Save your trip and go to Hillstone or Durants."}
{"text":"so awesome great salmon/bagel breakfast dark coffee! and the chicken cashew salad is rockin!"}
{"text":"The best food here is the appetizers. The meals aren't very good but if you go with a bunch of friends and order appetizers and drinks then you will have a fun time. Maybe step outside and play a game of chess on the giant chess board or checkers if you 
don't know how to play chess."}
{"text":"This place is primarily for hotel guests without transportation, and the food, unfortunately, is mediocre at best. Such potential too, great service, a gorgeous space, but the menu choices are lacking imagination although the presentation is excellent. But I go to a restaurant for the FOOD, and even their \"signature meatloaf\" was over-cooked and dry, the brisket \"special\" was very tough and thick and very fatty and also over-cooked. We had the chicken meatball appetizer which was the best thing we had, and the desserts were also excellent. Too bad the chef-de-cuisine doesn't know how to cook meat. A great place if you're stuck at a hotel, but there are MUCH better places close-by in the Biltmore fashion park."}
{"text":"Stay away!  We REALLY expected MUCH more at this high end property.  Food was just ok, and DID NOT live up to the room prices at this establishment.  They should be ashamed!  But the REAL issue was the service.  Not nearly enough staff on duty and those that were there were poorly trained.  We sat down at 6:30 pm with the dining area not nearly full and still waited over an hour for our meal.  Total time in the restaurant - 2 3/4 hours!  We were given the wrong menus, but the error was not caught until AFTER we had ordered.  When our meal was finally served we had no utensils to eat it with.  When we asked for them they were not brought, so we had to get up and steal them from a nearby table.  Nobody cared.  Remember, this is the BILTMORE!  Bus staff did not have a clue as to what they were there for - knocked things over and reached in front of us to clear the table.  We ordered wine with our entrees and it did not arrive until we asked the Manager to bring it half way through our meal.  Final insult was that the bill was wrong and had to be sent back for correction.  The waiter then had the nerve to give us a littany of excuses as to why things went so wrong when he brought the incorrect bill.  As I said, STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Really Hip n Happen'n Bar.  

Different & Interesting Drink List -
 Lavender Infused Organic Vodka with Candied Petals? 
 Lemonade, Organic Vodka & Muddled Basil?  
Wow, sure, I'll try that too!  (I do like them crisp and clean, so i prefer w/o any 'simple syrup' concoction they add to them all - way too sweet - but that's up to you and your taste.)

also thought the wine tasting - 3 pours of either a flight of red or white - was really cool and a good way to try wines I would not normally shell out for a ful glass or bottle.

Luved the bar bites sharing plates - totally YUM!  wow!  Duck, pork, turkey meatballs, tomotoe soup shooters, i forget what else, but i do intend to go back and try some more - they were excellent.

I did find it strange that along the bar, in the middle, they had this lower seating area, which was really weird - for wheelchairs?  it was strange looking down at people who kept sitting there.  They were introducing new menus and wine lists, so memorial wknd was super duper busy, which meant our service was not very prompt, but i can tell it was just one of those nites where it was out of the ordinary - there general standards look way above the normal, so i would like to visit again when it isn't as crazy there."}
{"text":"On the website, they have a beautiful pic of Marilyn Monroe lounging in a chair at the lovely Biltmore way back when. I suspect if you dug Marilyn up today, her condition may resemble the current state of the Biltmore.

We thought it might be fun to go have lunch at the hotel.  I wasn't starving which was great because the menu is seriously lackluster and resembles what you'd see at one of these local semi-chain casual dining beer restaurants.  We walked in and got a nice stare down from the bartender as we navigated our way through the bar to the hostess station.  Despite the fact there were hardly any customers, it took forever to seat us at a dirty table.  The hostess disappeared to find cleaning supplies so we had a chance to study our dirty menus.  After about ten minutes, she appeared with sour smelling rag in hand to wipe our table.  

Now that what little appetite I had was gone, I tried the small Waldorf salad or should I say dressing with some wilted greens.  If the dressing had been spicy as promised, I may have eaten a little but it wasn't so I didn't.  My husband had the tortilla soup and it came out lukewarm - he tried a spoonful and walked to the front to get our check. I'm guessing the soup was lukewarm because it probably sat ready for service for the half an hour it took to deliver. 

Maybe I didn't read this place correctly and it's only meant to be a kind of 19th hole, beer drinking, nacho eating low end spot...."}
{"text":"The crab cake Benedict and potatoes were exceptional. OJ is only ok. 

We have eaten breakfast here a few times and it is generally good, if somewhat pricy - it is after all the restaurant in the Biltmore."}
{"text":"I had expect more from this place as it is attached to an amazing hotel.  Service was great, but food was a bit lacking for the price.  My potatoes were supposed to be a purée and were more raw and mashed.  My mixed veggies were a old and chewy?  Salmon had good flavor and was well seasoned.

I set a high bar- hopefully you have a better meal."}
{"text":"was there for a late breakfast and early lunch.Food was very good with a good variety on the menu. Service was spotty at times but not inattentive. Staff did not hover over you. Sat indoor/ outdoors where it was warm and thought of all the cold places that we had escaped from. Well worth the time and the money."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Frank & Albert's is located inside the Arizona Biltmore.  As a result, the prices are sky high.  But it's one of the very few food options within walking distance of the hotel, so they can afford to charge a lot and still maintain their customer base.  My husband and I ate breakfast here because it was convenient (we were staying at the hotel) and we needed a quick bite to eat.  I had the breakfast wrap which unfortunately was a bit bland, and the fingerlling potatoes that were inside the wrap were a bit underdone (too firm).  It's hard to forgive screwing up such a simple thing.  However, the saving grace was my husband's french toast.  It looked very unassuming when it arrived at the table as a small-ish, rectangular loaf.  The serving size seemed a bit stingy for the price.  But my husband proclaimed it to be the best french toast he's ever had.  That's quite a compliment coming from a guy who is pretty critical of food and doesn't get especially excited about food in general.  But I had to agree that it was pretty damn good.  Even the fruit it came with was perfectly ripe and sweet.  If my wrap had been more flavorful and fully cooked, I wouldn't have minded so much that we paid $40 for breakfast for two people (and we didn't pig out).  But I think next time (if there is a next time) that I stay at the Biltmore, I'll plan to drive somewhere to get a more affordable breakfast."}
{"text":"Had both dinner and breakfast here. The dinner was beyond what we expected. Very tasty pork tenderloin and an above average pizza. 
Breakfast tacos were real good and filling. If you are staying at the Biltmore and looking for a meal, this is a really solid option."}
{"text":"We were staying in the area so we thought it would be nice to try the restaurant and walk around the grounds. We sat in the enclosed patio. Service was very good. I had the SW chicken salad which was outstanding.y wife had the tortilla soup which was about the best she has had. She had a side salad and after trying my salad she asked for some of the pineapple dressing which she liked. Definitely try this place even if you aren't staying at the Biltmore"}
{"text":"for the area and the price of each item I expected a lot more. this was a second choice for me because the Wright Restaurant didn't open until after 5, i ordered the short rib mac and cheese and it was nothing less then short, there was no taste to it at all, i had to add hot sauce just to get flavor an di am not even a fan of hot sauce,

i would say to avoid this joint, Denny's would be better"}
{"text":"Location and great view - check.  Service great - check.  Breakfast buffet - average.  Cost of food - absolutely crazy.  One breakfast buffet ($24) and ala carte order of oatmeal, fruit cup, and two smoothies = $60.00.  Go for the great outdoor seating, but don't expect any value or great food."}
{"text":"A delicious way to cap off a long day on the road to the Arizona Biltmore. We ordered the BR Cohn and the Kilt Lifter on the recommendation of our friendly server, Dannon. He did not steer us wrong all night...we had the \"Desert Flat\" for a starter which was simply amazing. It was a foccacia pizza with red onion marmalade, goat cheese, warm spinach, chicken (optional for veggies), and mandarin oranges. I might have to have it for lunch tomorrow! 

The entrees: grouper for him, Waldorf salad for me, were also excellent, but I can hardly get the butterscotch pudding we had for dessert out of my head. It was salted to perfection and well worth every last bite!"}
{"text":"Ok, I don't think that this will be spot that I go to all the time, but the Happy Hour is strong to very strong. 

$5 dollar bar boards. You get to pick four items. I had two sliders, a deviled egg, and a grilled cheese thingy. They were all darn good. 

Sitting outside is definitely a plus. Cool vibe and a great setting."}
{"text":"I took a friend of mine here for his 18th birthday.   Great food."}
{"text":"We just had drinks and a pizza. The prices are what you'd expect at a hotel, but the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"If Architecture & Ambiance is your thing than this is the place for you!

Frank Lloyd Wright, and his draftsman, Albert Chase Mcarthur, are honored by naming their Phoenix architectural masterpiece at the Biltmore Resort's main restaurant after them... 

The menu is good, the atmosphere a little dated, and there are a lot of blue hairs dining in this restaurant! 

It was not cheap & there was not much there on the plate to fill me up!
Overpriced & stingy portions are my big pet peeve...
Great if your on a date & want to order desert & coffee to hang out though!

I like the old school ambiance of this place, what I didn't like was the waitress telling me the lunch salad was a good portion, I'm sitting here starving as I write this review! It was Tasty though, but unless you are a 5'7\" 105 lbs super model this dish will not satisfy your hunger! 

The reason I give it 2 stars is because I liked the food, & the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while I was driving from Tucson to Sedona. Good food (including the tortilla soup) and service, and very pleasant atmosphere. Make sure to spend at least a few minutes before or after to wander around the hotel (the restaurant is located in the Arizona Biltmore) - it is an architectural gem."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Tortilla Soup is amazing!  Lisa was outstanding and ambiance is excellent for both a work luncheon and leisure."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance.....walk through the bar area to the the dining room, open kitchen, fairly loud.....expediter had a booming voice.

Started with a shared Waldorf Salad.....tangy dressing was like a vinaigrette mixed with yogurt.  Pretty good.  Crisped bits of bacon were tasty, but there were CHUNKS of bacon fat in the mix, which I used to gross out my wife.  That was not good.  Otherwise, just order the salad and ask them to keep out the bacon fat chunks.

She had pan roasted salmon, not her favorite way to have it cooked, but she tried to keep an open mind.  At the end, she felt it was just \"ok\".

I had the short rib.  It was overall the most disappointing short rib ever.  Beautiful and deliciously creamy polenta with corn salsa was amazingly tasty, but the rib was like a big piece of stew beef.  

It broke apart in strings, like pre-pulled pork.  A great short rib should be tender, flavorful, juicy and supple....this was chewy-chewy.  Supposedly it was rubbed with mole, but I couldn't taste it.  Not bad enough to send back, but not good enough to order again.

We shared the butterscotch pudding, and that was one of the best restaurant desserts we have had.  Try it!

With drinks and tip, the bill was $129.11"}
{"text":"Two nights in a row we were so disappointed. First night had to send my steak back twice for it being red when I requested medium well. After the whole ordeal taking so long I didnt want it anymore. 

Second night service was terrible and our order was messed up and took forever as we were told the kitchen was backed up... There was only 4 seated tables  in the dining room?? I have never encountered so many issues at a restaurant nor one I would expect to have a higher standard all the way around."}
{"text":"Amazing hearty food, nice atmosphere and helpful staff. My daughter and I had dinner here and we were pleased with our restaurant choice. We started off with the Smashed Avocado served with tortilla chips and pico. The ingredients were fresh and the serving was just right, not to large and not to small. It allowed us to have enough room for dinner. After debating all the enticing choices, I decided on the Chili Braised short ribs, that were served with Hayden Mills Grits, roasted poblano and tomato. Holy cow! Talk about upscaling meat and grits to another level. It was fantastic comfort food at a good price for the quality. The serving size was just right as well. 

My teen daughter enjoyed her choice of the Chicken Pilard. She allowed me to take a bite and it was full of fresh flavors.

Five stars and two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went to Frank & Albert's with my parents for a last-day-of-vacation breakfast and was literally shocked by how poor the experience was. We were seated quickly by the hostess who provided menus, and then waited at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged by anyone else ... no \"I'll be right with you\", no water, no coffee, no taking of our order. Once we finally did order, we waited another 10 minutes for our coffee which was delivered with cream but no sugar - after asking for it from the waitress, he was halfway through eating before she actually brought it.

The food arrived relatively quickly, delivered without a word by a guy from the kitchen. It was extremely hot and delicious. I had ordered a side of bacon which was not delivered. When the waitress finally brought the sugar, I asked for my bacon which then took another 15 minutes to arrive, once we were all pretty much done eating - and it was disgusting. It was brittle, dry, and tasted of chemical, like sterno. My parents both tried it and agreed ... I would have sent it back (it was $5.65 for 4 pieces), but at that point we just wanted to finish and leave.

The main issues I observed: The hostess seated folks as they came in and then did *nothing* else, just sat at her station in the middle of the room. There was one waitress serving all tables (5 total when we were there) - and was also the bartender. In order to access the bar, she had to walk around a hallway and in through a door behind the bar - an inefficient setup for someone needing to go back and forth. She was not well organized and could have used help - the hostess can't bring waters? Coffee? Also frustrating was the wait staff that came over from the other restaurant (they are connected) ... 2 additional waitresses that sauntered in and out, chatting and drinking water/coffee, while patrons waited without. Someone needs to seriously overhaul the game plan at Frank & Albert's.

The single star is because the food (except bacon) was delicious - the orange-ricotta pancakes were especially memorable."}
{"text":"The food was okay - not great, but okay.  I guess if you are interested in Frank Lloyd Wright architecture and staying at the Biltmore, its worth a visit, but not necessarily worth a special trip.

Fries poached in duck fat - very good, very well done
Grass fed sliders/hamburger - meat was good, bun was a little hard
Pizza - was actually quite tasty but not New Haven pizza - I think there is too much fat in the crust.  But even though it isn't authentic, it is nonetheless tasty.
Broccoli rabe - tasty, but a tad over cooked, a bit mushy
Angel hair pasta with olives - WAAAY too many olives. I love olives and this one was just overkill. Also, how is it that restaurants can make their pasta al dente?  pasta was overcooked.
Chicken and goat cheese flat bread - very good the figs and argula made it a very tasty and relatively healthy option
\"famous\" meatloaf - meh, but then again I have never been wowed by meatloa
Short ribs - okay, not great.
Salmon - It first came out too dry (overcooked) we had it returned and a new one came back cold. FAIL
Prime Rib - was very good, the potato was GINORMOUS

Though the Yelp review says $$, it's probably closer to $$$ - since most of the main dishes were in the $20-$30 range.  So with appetizers and drinks, the per person price was closer to $45-$50 than under $30."}

they make kick-ass bloody marys too!"}
{"text":"One of the Restaurants in the Biltmore Resort, we have had brunch several times at Wright's the other restaurant in the resort which was good but we wanted to try out the more casual atmosphere at Frank & Alberts. The decor inside was underwhelming aside from the walls and exterior which is classic Frank Lloyd Wright style definitely the more \"family friendly\" restaurant. Service was fine fairly average nothing was blatantly bad. Now the question to buffet or not to buffet?? That was the question. After our entrees the buffet at $21 dollars would only be $4 or $5 dollars more so it probably would have been a better deal I just wasn't in the mood to have the valet use a crowbar to help me into the car. One person in the party had the buffet I took a peek and it looked fairly standard. I had the build your own omelette with ham and spinach, it was very average, certainly not bad but not great. The fingerling potatoes were good smothered in onions which I didn't care for, some potatoes very cooked others hardly cooked. My toast had a bit of a delay arriving at the table but no big deal. I added sausage which was very good. Another friend at the table had pineapple upside pancakes which were good but incredibly sweet. My partner had the prime rib hash, corn, chili rojo, peppers, potatoes and fried eggs. Salty but delicious! To summarize whether you are staying at the resort or not check out at least a restaurant or two there if anything for the history rather than the food."}
{"text":"It had been a really long day and being that we were staying at the Biltmore here in Phoenix the mecca of great restaurants we decided to stay in and give Frank and Alberts a whirl. The design and decor of the place was straight out of Frank Lloyd architecture handbook, which made sense as the place is named after him and he did design the Biltmore. Anyhow...this place was just okay. Not great, not bad, but more like right in the middle. We had the onion rings, chopped caesar salad and the meatloaf. All of them were tasty. However, they were just average. Being in a resort it was a little pricey, but not too pricey."}
{"text":"Like the other reviews happy hour was amazing!  Great basil lemonade!  
Started out with the smashed avocado (guac).  Excellent since it was table side so we could pick & choose (not too much onion).  
Doug ordered the Flat iron steak.  This was much better than he was expecting!  I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp.  Too salty!  Yes, i understand olives & capers but way way too salty!  It would have been delish, but...
Thank you for the gluten-free option with the steak!  Service was Excellent!  We would go again."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to a hotel restaurant with high expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised when my food arrived. I ordered the Organic Celery Ceaser, and was definitely impressed.

{"text":"If you come to Frank and Albert's, it's for the views and location, not for the food.  It felt really hip to be at the famous Arizona Biltmore, in all its Art Deco glory, but the meal we had here was overpriced and nothing to write home about.  I had a chef's salad, upon another Yelper's recommendation that it was \"the best she had ever had\" and was thoroughly disappointed.  It was lackluster, and seemed as though the ingredients came out of a can.

After a sub-par meal, stroll the grounds and you won't be as upset that you got a little ripped off at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible service!   Rude, uneducated and seemed annoyed when asking for simple things like butter or sugar.  They laugh and are outwardly rude.  Never saw a manager who oversaw things the three days while we were there.  Therefore, staff (at least ours) did what they wanted.  Won't go back again! Love the property and other restaurant.  This one is very mediocre."}
{"text":"We visited Frank & Albert's on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Hardly anyone was there, as it was about 2:30 PM.  We had eaten lunch there a couple of years ago on the patio, and I had a great time then.  However, the temp was 114 on this particular afternoon, so the patio wasn't an option.  We were the only people in there other than the dude who talked on his phone the ENTIRE time we were there.  He even managed to order and eat his entire lunch while yapping.  

I ordered fish tacos, as I had the last time we were there.  Something has changed.  A previous reviewer mentioned this, and he was on the money.  I received two constructed tacos . . .soft tortilla shells in the shaper with cabbage etc.  only no fish!  Two large-ish filets of fish were on the side!  It was really messy . . .I had to tear apart the filets with my fork, smash some fish into the full-of-cabbage tortillas, and complete my own taco :(  I gave up on the second one and ate the veggie taco and the fish separately.  I really didn't like the seasoning on the fish, either.  I thought it was too harsh and blackened.  Ultimately, the fish tacos were \"meh\" to say the most.  I will not order them again.  My bf ordered a sandwich and since he must follow a special diet, he cannot eat mayo.  He reads ingredients very closely and requests things he can't have be left off.  His sandwich came slathered in mayo, even though it wasn't mentioned on the menu as an ingredient.  When we looked around for our server, he was nowhere to be found.  So, while I munched on messy tacos, bf sat looking sad for the next 5-7 minutes until we finally saw the server and flagged him down.

That being said, the server was AWESOME about making the new sandwich sans mayo, and we even received an extra order of sweet potato fries with sea salt.  They were yummy!  And when you see their house \"chipotle ketchup,\" DO try it!  I looked for it in the Biltmore gift shop, but they didn't have any for sale.  Oh well.  

I am not swearing Frank & Albert's off forever, but since I am only in Phoenix a few times a year, it will be a while before I go again."}
{"text":"Ask for Mary for a wArm and entertaining service experience. She was helpful and gave good suggestions try the heirloom tomatoes."}
{"text":"Had the Buffalo BLT sandwich. The sandwich came without the blue cheese mentioned on the menu and I wasn't given any silverware before my sandwich came out. (I sat at the bar). For $17 per sandwich I expect ALOT more than what I was given. Save your money."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while staying at the Biltmore. This is one of the lobby restaurants. It was nice easy seating. We just took a booth in the front bar area. This a pretty casual restaurant. We had the pretzel bites and the pizza. Both were very good. The pretzel bites were actually exceptional. The cheese is delectable. Would have loved to have more it only came with 4 sticks but oh well might have to go back. But this is a great restaurant if you are trying to get something simple and easy and maybe catch a game while staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"It's ironic that this restaurant is named after a great architectural team because Frank and Albert's suffers a fatal design flaw. The glass-enclosed dining room doesn't have any shades to block out the blinding Arizona sun. This has to be a problem that has been brought to management's attention before. I cannot believe they haven't installed anything to protect their customers' retinas.  We had a bridal shower in that room, and all the people who had the misfortune of facing the windows spent the afternoon with their hands shading their eyes and wearing sunglasses.  Very uncomfortable and unpleasant experience.

As for the food, the bread and french fries are great. I'm a big fan of the chipotle ketchup that's on the table. However, I was really disappointed with the casear salad. The kitchen's interpretation of the classic is to add a shit-ton of celery. Yuck. My tofu entree was good. The green beans with it were really delicious and fresh. Dessert was a disaster. I got soy ice cream which I normally enjoy, but I'm pretty sure the abomination that was served to me had been sitting in the freezer for at least a year. 

Two of our servers, Sherri and John, were outstanding. They were so friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Casual ambience within the resort with a lot of options...Didn't see any vegetarian options but the chef made me a special fancy grilled cheese on request which was amazing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a sumptuous dinner here with two companions. The service was impeccable and our appetizers, entrees and desserts were delicious. Adding to this culinary delight was a superb bottle of wine from a local Arizona vineyard. 

Kudos to Frank & Albert's and the Arizona Biltmore Resort, a Waldorf Astoria fine resort. 

This hotel holds a special place in my heart. I'm not biased, I'm enthralled at her beauty."}
{"text":"We thought the food was good and the atmosphere was great.  I thought the prices were a bit much for what you got.  I ordered the breakfast buffet for $20, it consisted of an omelette bar, yogurt-tini's, sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, and some breads.  For a LOT less you get a LOT more at other places, but then again you're at the Biltmore.  The seating is very cool, lots of different set-ups, they even have a table in its own private glassed in room.  Service was nothing to write home about, I think our water was filled once after sitting empty for some time.  If you order coffee they give you a pot."}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor space and excellent food. I had the empanadas, while my dining companions had the fish tacos and the Cobb Salad. The fish came on the side and had to be put in to the tacos yourself--they still looked and I'm told tasted wonderfully.

I had the basil lemonade drink, which was quite tasty.
The desert menu was very appealing, but we unfortunately had to dash before we could enjoy desert."}
{"text":"Delightful breakfast buffet in a beautiful setting. Tasty food. Pleasant staff. Beautiful patio."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful setting!! We popped in for an early dinner 5p, on a Sunday. Just wanting to enjoy the gorgeous AZ weather and have a decent meal. 

Mind you, this is a Waldorf Astoria property!!! That being the case, you expect a certain level of service. 

\"Service\" - Our server, Ken N. was disheveled, dirty uniform and had a flippant, dismissive manner. He never told us about the specials either. We later overheard another server letting her table know about specials. He never came back to see if we needed more water or anything else. We ordered cappuccinos and he didn't bring the sugar or spoons. We asked for them, he then brought the sugar, no spoons, we asked for spoons again... by the time we had what we needed, they weren't hot and my experience was tainted. 

\"Food\" - The shrimp cocktail was really a joke. For 21.00, we assumed it would be 3-4 jumbo shrimp/prawns. There were 4 very small, grocery store-like shrimp on a plate. Husband's pizza was excellent and a good value. My caesar salad with salmon was excellent and a good value. The cappuccinos, aside from being warmish, weren't anything that I would expect from The Waldorf Astoria. Maybe it's just me, but I would expect some kind of presentation... maybe a small spoon and a cube of raw sugar, a small biscotti, a doily, lol.. something! 

Disappointed at best. We didn't even have alcohol and our bill was 100.00. Had the service been adequate, the cost vs. everything else probably wouldn't have even registered with me. 

** Here's the scariest part ** Ken was training a new server!! He was talking really loud and authoratative so everyone on the patio could hear that he was training. God help her!!!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast and dinner here while we were staying at the hotel and had very good meals. The Sea Bass and Salmon were very good and the service was attentive. Nice ambience if a bit loud at times. Seats near the fire were nice on a cold night."}
{"text":"We ate at Frank & Albert's while staying at the Biltmore last weekend.  My family was visiting from New Hampshire and we had a large group (10). When we arrived, we were seated in a private room (which was great, since we did not request one).  The food was wonderful and my niece was so happy that Macaroni & Cheese was on the menu.  I actually had the same thing, since hers looked so delicious.  The Macaroni & Cheese was spectacular - I love trying it at nicer restaurants, and this one was in my top ten. Best of all, our server was the funniest and most accommodating server I've ever encountered. He handled my very Irish family perfectly :) I highly recommend that you ask for Krasi when you dine there!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this place is a total ripoff for lunch.  If not for people using their corporate Amex cards while being stranded on the island, this place would have no chance.  This cheeseburger and fries combo is not worth $15.  It just isn't.  And the service doesn't warrant the markup, either."}
{"text":"Went for lunch during my first day at Arizona Biltmore. Restaurant was recommended by the young lady who checked us in. 

I went with the burger and my wife went with the fish tacos. Both were very tasty and in line with what you'd expect at a beautiful venue such as Frank and Alberts. 

What really stood out was the service. Our server was Sherri and she was absolutely amazing. Took some time to hold a conversation with us and recommended some things to do during our visit to Phoenix. 

We also had questions about some of the dishes and Sherri gave us real 'get this, don't get that' answers which I really appreciate. Versus 'everything is great here'. Even though everything may be great, of course some things are better than others. 

So yeah, I appreciate the awesome service, and delicious food. We will definitely be back this week!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and disappointment for Easter . No plates or food in buffe line! Over cooked everything.... Total chaos or what they charge! Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, and great service. I recommend the turkey club and the tortilla soup, but not the artichoke dip (unless you're into sweet artichoke dips, which apparently I am not). 

They may be a bit pricy but they earn it, and the atmosphere and setting were clean, plus the restaurant had the most comfortable temperature in all of the sites at the Biltmore. 

You'll enjoy it, but you may have to wait. Don't worry, they'll text you when your table is ready!"}
{"text":"We ate here multiple times while staying at the Arizona Biltmore as part of the all-inclusive package rate they offer.  The food overall was very good!  A few of the highlights:

Smashed Avocado - Solid choice for an appetizer.

Meatloaf - This was probably our hands-down favorite item!  I never knew meatloaf could be so good!

Scottish Salmon - Very good but a bit of a small portion.

The salads - I tried several of them and they were all kind of 'meh'.  Granted it's a salad, but the actual end-result didn't quite jive with the super-yummy descriptions.

S'mores Dessert - Who doesn't love roasting marshmallows at their table! :)

Breakfast Buffet - Eh, it was ok.  There was nothing wrong with it per se, but it wasn't always kept full (sometimes the fruit bowls were empty or there was no butter out) and the selection is a little limited.  I will say the omelet station is probably the way to go here.

Service was generally fine, but certainly nothing special.  We also avoided sitting in the back sun-room (despite their attempt to seat us back there every.single.time) because it was absolutely freezing back there!

Overall a good choice if you're staying on the property!"}
{"text":"$56 for an omelet and a Benedict that I could easily make at home with no culinary degree. Food is tasteless with no effort put in making them. Don't ruin your beautiful Sunday morning eating here unless you are staying at the hotel and have no other choices."}
{"text":"Really delicious chicken sandwich and best crispiest fries I have ever tasted. My companion enjoyed his hamburger and with one cocktail and tip our lunch came to $60 so not cheap but it was so delicious and a great ambience. We will go back. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"I met an industry colleague at Frank & Albert's this week for a holiday lunch.  We sat at a lovely table next to the firepit on the patio - what a lovely way to enjoy lunch in early December in the desert!  Our server was friendly and professional and my salad was absolutely delicious! 
I highly recommend the ancient grains power salad with quinoa, farro, kale, sweet potatoes, pomegranate seeds, pears, goat cheese, cranberry relish with shrimp and a citrus white balsamic vinaigrette...so seriously tasty!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for happy hour last night.  If you stick to the happy hour menu then its a pretty good deal.  I should have listened to my own advice because after having a way-too-sweet happy hour Prickly Peartini I decided I needed a \"big boy\" drink and ordered a regular martini.  While the regular martini was decent, I should have stuck to the Prickly because $17 was outrageous for the size they give you.  My wife made the same mistake and ordered a $15 glass of wine instead of their \"house\" wine which would have been $5.  Needless to say we learned our lesson when it comes to drinks at this place.  We were a bit smarter about the food.

We shared a \"Savory Nibbles\" platter which is a selection of 4 very small....nibbles.  We shared the deviled egg, meatloaf slider, grilled cheese and the shrimp and manchego flat.  It was all excellent and I could have eaten an entire plate full of any one of those things.  Be warned that they are only a very small taste and only enough for one bite each if you are sharing with another person.  Anyway its not bad for $5 during happy hour.  There are 3 or so other selections that looked good as well.

3 or so of their other appetizers are 1/2 off during happy hour so we ordered the Charred Chicken Lollipops.  You get a decent portion of small chicken drumstick things in some tasty sauce.  They are NOT fried and weren't drowned in sauce.  Anyway, these were excellent and I would definitely order them again. 

Like most decent happy hours in the valley, this one was quite typical in terms of service.  The bar area gets a bit crowded and it takes forever to get a drink and food.  It is not really the waiters' fault because they are going almost as fast as they can.  The problem is that there aren't enough of them so they are stuck serving way to many tables."}
{"text":"Great food. Biltmore is a top notch resort and this restaurant lives up to the standards of Blitmore. Food was great. I had the buffet which consisted of Country Fried Chicken, Stake, Mashed Potatos, Gravy, Fruit Salad, Vegis... I mean the whole deal. It was all so tasty. 

Buffet is well priced. But the menu items are a bit expensive. Food is great but I think some of the items are over priced for the size of the portion served, lol. I eat a lot, so my portions need to be bigger.

The people are nice."}
{"text":"This place is great if you are staying at the Arizona Biltmore. It's not too fancy, but the food is high quality. They told me that their meatloaf was their \"specialty item\", so I decided to give it a try. It was amazing! I would definitely return to this place if I'm ever staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"We are here twice on vacation. The first day, it took ten to fifteen minutes for someone to acknowledge our table. Our waitress was deeply apologetic that no one let her know they seated us in her section. She made up for the issue with complimentary chips and guacamole. The food was good, but timing on entrees was totally off. Our children received their pizza ten minutes before we received our salads.

The second time we dined there, I ended up with food poisoning from their burger. Service this time was very attentive...but it doesn't help when the kitchen staff are serving subpar food."}
{"text":"WOW! The Southwestern Chicken Salad is a MUST HAVE!! I stayed at the Biltmore for 7 days and managed to have this Salad 4x!! I'm not kidding you when I say I woke up craving it! My friends were laughing at me until they tasted it too and loved it! Seriously Delicious! If I ever return to Phoenix I may have to stop here just for that magical salad!"}
{"text":"If you're here for happy hour and are sitting at the bar, this place is awesome, and the prices are great.  Come here for breakfast and you will see both a menu and a breakfast buffet that manage to be overpriced and limited in variety at the same time.  I would've gone elsewhere, but I've no rental car and the other restaurants at the hotel are closed."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Sunday evening, as the \"fancier restaurant\" at the resort was close. DId I mention I had 4 starving teenage boys with me? What a pleasant surprise this restaurant was, the food was great and our server, Lisa Tussing, who is studying to get her sommelier's designation was a big part of the reason the meal was so enjoyable. I had the surf and turf and one of my son's had the ribs with mac and cheese. Everyone enjoyed their meal, the presentation was great and the wine pairings that Lisa suggested were fabulous. We enjoyed this restaurant so much, we came back on Monday evening, even though the \"fancier restaurant\" was also open. I suggest the s'mores for dessert, although the creme brulee and the warm apple cobbler with ice cream was delicious too. Will definitely come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Slow service in the bar when there was no other patrons. I've been to Frank & Albert's many times, but what I've found is that unless your over the age of 55 and wearing designer clothing the staff would rather not serve you. The food was fairly good and the atmosphere nice. The prices are reasonable, however I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5
Decor: 5
Ambiance: 5
Service: 4
Value: 5

An absolute must-visit for FLW fans. Great happy hour deals and actual quality food/drinks."}
{"text":"Over priced for the food that was provided and poor service at this type of resort restaurant. Lunch for 6 of us with one drink cost over $200. Our server had to keep asking what kind of drink we wanted numerous times!

Our group started off with the cilantro hummus, which was extremely light and didn't taste like hummus. To be honest, it was more like baby food. To the main meal, I had ordered the special which was fry bread with cilantro chicken, beans, tomato, guacamole and sour cream - almost a taco (average). Everyone else had ordered a burger, which deemed the better option (better than average).

Location of this place is pretty in the Arizona Biltmore but wish it made more of a food impact on me rather than architecturally. Love Frank Lloyd Wright!!"}
{"text":"We sat down and it took 15 minutes for a waiter to notice us. We ordered and after 30 minutes we got up and left. Terrible, Terrible service"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy dining at Frank & Alberts but a visit last week for dinner with out of town guests was really disappointing.  Started with the roasted tomato soup that tasted and had the mouth feel of diluted tomato paste. The meatloaf that I have enjoyed many times was just ok but the portion was much smaller than before. One of my companions stopped after two spoons of the soup and was also disappointed with the portion size of the meatloaf. Though incredibly uncrowded on a Saturday night the service was listless. And to boot when I got the check the server had added his gratuity without mentioning it to us. I am used to this latter practice for a party of 6 or more but we were only 4. I did complain to the manager but he did absolutely nothing!  If this represents the new Frank & Albert's its in serious trouble.

{"text":"The hotel was a train wreck.  The restaurant on the other hand was better.  I ate more meals in this hotel restaurant than most.  Convenience was the big reason.  I had dinner the first night which was a burger.  The food was fresh and service was good.

The next morning I had breakfast which was just eggs and bacon but it was good.  The bacon was a little too undercooked and the toast was raw which happens sometimes but it was fixed right away. That same afternoon I got back to the hotel and sat down for lunch.  It was so hot outside that I wasn't really in the mood to eat but then I saw the Robert Redford peanut butter pie and decided to order that with a cup of coffee.  It was really good."}
{"text":"Dined here twice during my stay at the Biltmore - dinner and breakfast. Both were delicious. 

Dinner
They serve complimentary bread with dinner. Its an Italian style white bread with garlic in it, served with honey pecan goat cheese spread. Both are delicious on the their own but imo, sweet goat cheese doesn't really go with garlic bread. 

I ordered the Cesar salad with salmon (Not listed on the menu, they charge you $10 for the salmon which I thought was a bargain). The salmon was pan seared and cooked beautifully. They have a garlic-Cesar dressing and it is out of this world! My only  critiques are that the croutons are a little underwhelming. I'm not sure if they make them in house, but they seemed boxed. Also, there was too much cheese in the salad. 

Breakfast
I order the ricotta flap jacks. They are served with (a huge scoop) of vanilla bean butter, blueberry compote and maple syrup. Very good! The flap jacks are light and fluffy and a nice change from regular old pancakes. They also happily swapped out the compote for fresh berries upon request. 

I tried some of their regular pancakes and these were really good too - a huge portion too. 

If you order coffee, they'll leave a huge pot at the table. 

I'm a little cautious of resort restaurants-sometimes they're overpriced and don't deliver but this place is awesome! The food is good and the menu is diverse. The prices are reasonable.

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Now I know why President Obama skipped the Biltmore on his recent visit. He must have been informed about the Pork Belly and the Corned Beef from Frank and Alberts.

The atmosphere is mostly very impressive. It's very rich and airy. It's very cool Frank Lloyd Wright but with a retro diner kind of feel.

A few things about the atmosphere were not impressive. Dirty Salt and pepper shakers and crumbs on the floor. I also noticed bowls of tortilla chips just sitting out getting stale and dusty on the line the whole time we were seated. 

I ordered the house made corned beef sandwich. When it arrived I thought it looked OK and took a bite. All I could taste was sauerkraut. Then I took a piece of meat out to try. It felt slimey and was very fatty. I cut off the fat and tasted the meat and it seemed corned but lacked the spices that flavor the meat. It was pretty tasteless and was just slimey and fatty. I gave a piece to my husband to try and he also said it seemed slimey to him and tasteless. I was hoping our waitress would check on us but she didn't.

I asked my husband how his Pork Belly BLT was. He said the porkbelly and roll was very dry, the bacon was good and the tomatoes were old. I didn't know how dry the porkbelly was until I got home and feed some to my dogs. It was the driest piece of meat I ever felt in my life. It was so dry that if you rubbed your skin with it you could cut yourself on it. I thought my sandwich was awful but after feeling that porkbelly I think his sandwich was worst and both sandwiches were served with cold fries.

We were NEVER checked on or asked how our meal was.

I know I should have found a manager to complain to but sometimes you just get so bummed you don't feel like it. This was suppose to be an extra special meal out at an exceptional place. These sandwiches cost about $16.00 each. Fortunately I have a Scottsdale Preferred Card and had one meal off the check but even if the meals were free they'd still be horrible. 

I don't know if my exsperience is typical or not.

If you still want to give them a try after reading my review you have to do a valet park or park yourself in the garage that's around a little way from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh! For a high end hotel restaurant I was expecting a little more. Our server was OK, but not great. We sat for a while with empty glasses. If he was super busy I would understand, but he wasn't. My scallops were good and first drink was fabulous, but the margarita was too sweet. The sour in it should be switched to a house made simple syrup for a more fresh taste. What threw me for a loop was when we received our bill and an automatic 18% gratuity was added for our party of 3. Really?? I can understand policy for a party of 8 or more,  but 3 people? I was extremely offended. Do we appear to be people who don't tip well? Well, I tip minimum 20%.I have worked in the industry and appreciate people who are in the service industry. Our server missed out on some extra cash because of the automatic tip. If that is policy for every check, then I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Thought this was a nice place to celebrate a special occasion with friends. However, very disappointed. The food was mediocre and the service was poor. We waited so long for our breakfast that our friends were done eating by the time our food arrived --- and it wasn't even hot. How long did it sit out waiting to be delivered to us?  Then, the waitress smacked an 18% grat on our bill -- for a party of two. Better of trying some of the breakfast eateries on Camelback (Snooze, Matt's Big Breakfast) that will provide better value and service!"}
{"text":"I was staying at this hotel for a conference, and the first day i ate both lunch and dinner here, and the last day I ate lunch.

First up, lunch: quesadilla was full of BBQ sauce (like completely smothered). It was called a bbq chicken quesadilla, but i thought it just meant that the chicken was barbecued, and sauce would be on the side. Not so. It was okay, but not great. Iced tea was just so-so, and at $4.00, the drinks should be spectacular. There's no reason a fountain drink should cost that much, ever. Even if the tea was brewed, this is tea, after all. Not like it was brewed with water that someone had to trek and get from the melting ice caps.

Sunday dinner: had the \"famous\" tortilla soup. Good, but nothing I would call famous. 

Last lunch/dinner: tried the buttermilk chicken bites, which were much smaller than I expected, but the breading was nice and crispy, and the sauce wasn't too much. I could have easily gotten something else to go along with it, but had to head to the airport. I liked this much more than the quesadilla.

Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"It Was Great!! Wasn't Planning Much but R&R For Memorial Weekend- When We Decided to Go Out for Dinner.  Frank & Albert's Was On our Preferred Fine Dining Card (Good for Bogo ) It's a Great Way to Try New Restaurants and Ones Perhaps Off the Main Area You Live.  We Went for Happy Hour Which they Have 3-6 EVERY Day- So We Were Able to make a 7:00 Res. & Went at 5:00 -5:30 to Have a Drink & Check Out Menu.  It was Great Choices at HH are Limited But Reasonable Select Drinks, Beers & Wine or $4-$5-$6 & Some Bites $5  The Meatloaf Sliders were Recommended & They Were Great !! Tasty!! For Dinner we Had the Ribeye Served with Cheesy Scalloped Potatoes Tomato & Asp. So it was a Whole Dinner for $40.  Along with a Shared Ceasar Salad.  Excellent Service by Lisa, and We Went for Broke & Shared a Cheesecake for Dessert.  Delish !!   We Are looking Forward to Going Back to this Beautiful Property."}
{"text":"Immerse yourself in a setting inspired by Mr.Frank Lloyd Wright himself and savor some of the better Southwestern infused upscale comfort food this side of anything offered at Kai.  It truly captures the essence of its famous namesake."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant with a group of 7 people. We were seated outside behind the fireplace at about 6 pm on a Sat night in early April. The service was absolutely deplorable.  The server was very slow and never asked us if we wanted refills on drinks, forgot an entire appetizer order and had to be found to pay the bill. The only really good thing on the menu was the onion rings. The Sea Bass was loaded with Salt, but otherwise dry. My daughters hamburger was not medium, but over done...hard as a rock. My wife's apple salad was mostly apples. We had to ask several times to get more bread and waited over an hour each time for our food. When we mentioned to the waiter that the appetizer order was completely forgotten, his response was \" oh sorry,\" with no offer of anything complimentary to make up for the error.  The service was possibly the worst I've ever had and my family is in the restaurant business and I've eaten at a multitude of places"}
{"text":"I am staying at the hotel and have eaten here times. The food is very uninspired only to complimented by service of the same level. Good for a beer if you can get the service. Beyond that the fried chicken sandwich is over cooked and has no flavor. The Hamburger is not seasoned and the bun is a greasy mess. Stick with a beer and the eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Located inside the Arizona Biltmore, this is the more casual of their two main restaurants.  

My husband and I had dinner here, and were both pleased.  The green chili chicken empanadas were a bit dry, but tasty nonetheless.  The New York strip was perfectly cooked and topped with a mound of garlic butter and served with sea salt fries which were fantastic.

Bumping to 4 stars for outstanding service.  Definitely worth a trip back in better weather to enjoy their patio!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes. Nice spot at the Biltmore Hotel. We sat on the patio, which nice. What wasn't so nice was the food and service. Overcooked fish, slow service and my wife's second drink was forgotten. At that point I can't even accept the kind free dessert. Nothing horrible about F. and A., just not good enough at the moment to go back."}
{"text":"Came here for Easter breakfast buffet and wanted an option that wouldn't give me as much sticker shock like the Easter brunch at Wright's on property which was $100+/adult and $40/kid vs. $28/adult at Frank & Albert's. That being said, I get it....it IS the Arizona Biltmore so you are expected to unload a lot of money here as it is a five star resort. We were guests for the Biltmore's Easter activities and our children enjoyed an egg hunt, in addition to an adorable carnival. We had an 11:15am reservation to Frank & Albert's which I had booked almost 3 weeks in advance. I assumed it would probably be packed. After all the Easter festivities, we got to the restaurant 10 minutes early. I checked in with the hostess to see if we could be seated earlier than our reservation time. I glanced around at the restaurant and it was half empty. I was told no, and to return at 11:15am. No biggie, as my kids enjoyed playing chess outside at the nearby outdoor chessboard. At 11:15 we returned and were finally seated at a booth with two sets of silverware tucked inside a rolled up napkin.  Sherry was our server and she was very pleasant. Our kids opted to order off the menu, whereas my husband and I had the breakfast buffet, which has a nice variety of warm breakfast foods, an omelet station, cured meats and cheese platter, fresh fruit, pastry basket variety (our faves were the mini chocolate croissant), yogurt and oatmeal. It was plenty filling for all of us. Though Sherry was kind to bring out our food and refill our drinks, we had to fend for ourselves to get three additional napkins and silverware for our family. After we were finished eating, it took quite awhile to flag our server so we could get the check to pay our bill. We weren't quite sure what caused such a delay considering the fact it wasn't busy (by the time we left, the restaurant was still half empty). Maybe it was a fluke, or maybe we should have come for dinner time on another day, but the food was just OK, and nothing I'd consider noteworthy or outstanding. For a restaurant on property at a resort of this caliber, I had higher expectations of the food quality and service."}
{"text":"I love the new and improved Frank and Albert's! Over the years, I've frequented Frank and Albert's and always enjoyed my meal and experience. It was always a solid good time. Just recently, they reopened their doors with a renovation, so I was eager to revisit to see if it was the same or better then it was before. The answer is...both the same and better!

I'll first start with the decor. The new decor is nice. It's trendier and newer and not just your typical diner experience anymore. They created a sun room of sorts, so you can eat inside with the feel of outside but you won't have to worry about the weather since you're actually inside! The patio remains the same with new and improved patio furniture and the fire place (my favorite part) still remains! 

Now on to the food. The food is much like the original food, but has some new improvements. I went with the sandwich and holy moly bread. I think it was about a loaf of bread in one sandwich but no necessarily a bad way! A cone full of sweet potato fries accompanied the sandwich and were the perfect mix. The sandwich was too large to eat in one sitting but each bite was tastefully delightful! When I got my meal, they provided me with normal ketchup and Frank and Albert's house made ketchup. I gave the house made ketchup a chance just to see what it was like but unfortunately it didn't quite live up to Heinz expectations."}
{"text":"My bride and I love the Biltmore and certain are huge fans of all of the culinary delights offered there. As it's located on one of the area's oldest and famous resorts, stick around and take a stroll through the hotel and the grounds."}
{"text":"Very disappointing Christmas dinner. Evening started poorly with restaurant not honoring what they advertise. Slow for server to acknowledge table. Ordered Shepard's Pie. Carrots and peas barely cooked, almost raw. Sent back. Daughter ordered a pizza. Crust so soggy could not be picked up. 

Surprising as I have eaten at Wright's and found it very good. Would never return."}
{"text":"We ate here twice during our stay at the Biltmore.  Breakfast is probably the best thing they do.  Our breakfast was wonderful.  I had a sort of southwest inspired Benedict (without the ham) and the corn 'cake' underneath was to die for and laced with chilis.  We were given a large pot of decaf which was wonderfully brewed.  Our roasted breakfast potatoes were actually \"roasted to perfection.\"  (It's funny how so many menus will say something is prepared \"to perfection\" and how little it's actually true, but it was true here and they didn't actually say it on the menu.)

We also enjoyed our server who was entertaining, friendly and accommodating.

Switch over to evening and our 2nd meal at F&A's - dinner.  The food was decent but not spectacular.  I'm pretty sure the Ceasar salad had MSG in the dressing because I only had two bites of my boyfriend's salad and within a few minutes I was well into an MSG reaction.  So, docking a star for that.  The roasted winter vegetables were sublime.  I'd never really enjoyed parsnips before, but these ones rocked.

If you don't feel like leaving \"campus\" Frank & Albert's will do you right.  (Just watch out for the MSG.)"}
{"text":"Frank & Albert's is probobly one of my favorite restaurants in town. The menu is creative and the ingredients are very fresh - its just good, unpretentious comfort food made and served in the best way possible. The home-made ketchup and mustard are excellent additions to the delicious onion rings and duck fat fries. The drinks are also innovative."}
{"text":"Recently had dinner with wife and we had the worst time. The sever Judy K was incredibly rude, made mistakes, drinks came late and gave us a night that we will try and forget. Been going for years, and this was the worst service we have ever received."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places.  (More so than dinner) For brunch the spicy bloody mary's are the best way to start.  They have a great ricotta french french toast.  If you have a hankering for dessert, they have tableside smores which you don't find anywhere else.
After brunch you can stroll the grounds and enjoy the beautiful weather.  They have a great happy hour where you can get $5.00 drinks and $5.00 small plates and nibbles.  Overall, can't go wrong, one of the better resort restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  The soup and salad (southwestern chicken salad) is a delicious meal for those not seeking to indulge on heavier items.  Located at the Biltmore Resort, this restaurant has it all.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Biltmore and had breakfast here twice and drinks outside. I missed the breakfast menu but they were able to accomodate me both days. I ordered egg whites with cheese and they were good each time. The price was different each time for the same thing, but other than that the food was good.  The service was excellent for both food and cocktails."}
{"text":"The place was not busy when our party of six arrived.  The physical setting is clean and kind of high tech.  The waiter was better than okay but not great.  The food was disappointing for the price.   The hotel is excellent.  The food was less than average.  

They use too much salt in their cooking for my taste.  The meatloaf reads interesting and was recommended by a bar tender - don't do that.  Three of the party had prime rib and said it was as good as the \"Saturday night special\" any place in the country except the potatoes were undercooked.   

Overall, it was a okay meal at pretty upscale price.  I like the hotel but I will not eat that this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I love the Biltmore; Frank & Albert's? No so much.  

Dinner this past Saturday night was, in a word, disappointing.  I had previewed their menu on line and was looking forward to the pork belly entree.  Alas, when I arrived and looked at the menu, no pork belly.  The waiter was very apologetic and let me know that it had been removed - 2 months ago! Oh well, so it goes...I settled for the seafood risotto, which was pretty much a bowl of mush adorned with so so shellfish and a tough slab of whitefish.  The margaritas were the highlight of the visit.

Sunday brunch held better possibilities- the BLT was advertised as featuring not only bacon, lettuce and tomato with a tasty sounding onion marmalade, but also slices of pork belly! The presentation, including a stainless steel basket of delicious French fries, was so appetizing that I did the food porn thing and snapped a pic to share with my foodie daughter.  The bun appeared to be a delight from the oven, but unfortunately turned out to be quite stale and inedible.  When asked \"who was everything\" by my very sweet waitress, I pointed out the rock hard puck on my plate and let her know that while the stuffing was great, the bun was not. I overheard her report to the kitchen, but that was the end of the discussion.  Oh well, once again.

Because Wright's is not open for Sunday dinner, it was back to F&A's once again.  I enjoyed the spare ribs - obviously slowed cooked with intense and very enjoyable flavors.  One out of three ain't bad, I guess...

Make that one out of four.  I went back for breakfast this morning (I, know, I must be a glutton for punishment or just a knucklehead!) with my sister.  You are not going to believe this, but they had porky belly and scrambled eggs on the menu - pig heaven for me, right? No so quick!  The waiter looked at me funny and told us he thought they were belly-less.  This absolutely cracked up my sister (who had been at the similarly belly-less dinner Saturday night). Sure enough, he checked with the kitchen and no bellies. Whatever...

Next time I'm at the Biltmore, I'm getting off the property and finding my own bellies!"}
{"text":"My coolest gal pals and I celebrated my birthday at Frank & Albert's at the Arizona Biltmore Resort.  We went during happy hour to take advantage of their lower pricing.  Unbelievable time all of us had!!  There was enough of us in attendance that we were able to try everything on the HH menu.  The food, the drinks, the service was beyond belief.  It truly lives up to the name and reputation of The Arizona Biltmore.  Of course, we shall go again and again."}
{"text":"I had a superb meal during Arizona Restaurant Week. I started with a wonderful salad with an unusual form of green (it was stringy and fiberous, but it was good)-I will give them props for a unique and enjoyable twist on a salad. This was followed by a delicious filet mignon expertly prepared accompanied by french friends paoched in duck fat....just like they make in France!!!! this was topped off by a yummy banana and fruit parfait. The outdoor patio made for a really enjoyable atmosphere.

So why two stars? The service was apathetic from the moment we sat at the bar to order drinks. The bartender and later our server never smiled and acted like they could have cared less about looking after us. They were not overtly rude, but they certainly did not go out of their way to be the least bit pleasant and this made the overall experience VERY disappointing. This is The Biltmore, and I would expect warmer service for the level of diner that would typically patronize this restuarant.  

Perhaps because it is The Biltmore, the staff feel the need to do their job with their noses in the air. Or perhaps because we were there for Arizona Restaurant Week, the staff were expecting a lousy tip and wanted to get us in and out as quickly as possible. I have to added that I went with some friends in the service industry. Depsite the bad service, we left 20 percent anyway. If it had been left up to me, I probably would have left 10 percent. There was nothing wrong with my order or my meal, but the collective attitude at that place sucked.

In any case, this experience left me with a very bad impression and I don't think I would go back. And this is unfortunate because the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"I ate at Frank & Albert's twice while staying at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Both times, the food was decent but the service was horrible. I tried a few different salads, a few pizzas, and a few appetizers. 

The first time I dined here, we sat outside by the fireplace which was lovely. The weather was perfect and the company was great too. The second time I came here, we sat inside but the problem was that they only had 1 server on duty that night inside. It was so slow!!!! 

For being one of two restaurants in a very prestigious hotel, they really should consider hiring more staff."}
{"text":"Seth and I stayed at The Biltmore this summer and had breakfast in Frank and ALberts every morning.  It was really good for breakfast but at the end of the day it's a safe resort menu.  Don't get me wrong because that's not a horrible thing...just predictable. 

The huge plus to F&A is they source local meats and produce.  Score big for them.  Think about it for a second.  That place can actually keep a farmer employed because of the volume they order.  Because of that (and one of the friendliest staffs known to man) I give them 5 stars.  

Although predictable it's really tasty.   Order the mint and pineapple smoothie!"}
{"text":"Was at the Biltmore Fashion Park and headed over to the restaurant based on local recommendations. It was not very good.  The food was bad and the service was worse. The self-proclaimed famous tortilla soup had little-to-no flavor and used canned vegetables.  I ordered a salad that was supposed to come with a vinaigrette but instead came with a thick creamy dressing that tasted like tangy ranch.  On to the service: after we were seated it took 10 minutes for an older blond waitress to even notice us and it wasn't even that busy! When she asked for our drink order, she seemed upset that I just ordered a lemonade, it was weird.  Then we asked for bread, which we never got. After she brought the check we reminded her and she was just like \"whoops\".  I imagine she is the sister of the owner or something.   She came back with bread that we were able to use to clear our palates of that awful meal.  Another negative is the price: soup and salad for two plus one lemonade cost us $60! For terrible tasting, poor quality food.

One positive is that the kitchen is fast. They got the orders to us right away.

  So, if you are in the mood to be treated poorly and eat bad, expensive food, then this place is for you.  Otherwise stay away."}
{"text":"Not only did I enjoy sitting outside for a lovely ladies business lunch at Frank & Albert's last week, but I enjoyed the best Cobb salad ever!  I'm picky about chicken and this was excellent quality and delicious rotisserie chicken they used.  The combo of the other ingredients (lettuce, tomato, egg, avocado, bacon, and black olives) along with the green goddess dressing was superb.  It was a beautiful presentation too!

My dining companions' meals looked amazing as well.  I saw the Biltmore Bistro Burger, the Grilled Fish Tacos, and the B.A.L.T. (their Tuesday Blue Plate Special).  We devoured pretty much everything on the table too...

The service was a tad on the slow side but it was also a packed restaurant.  I will have to return for breakfast, dinner, and/or happy hour too as all of their menus look outstanding.  The bar/drinks menu alone has something for everyone with economy friendly prices.  If you have not yet been to the Arizona Biltmore, this new restaurant is reason to go... and since this year marks the Biltmore's 80th Birthday, there is a ton of history in the resort as well."}
{"text":"A co-worker had recommended frank & Albert's for Christmas as she has been a few times. Having never had a Holiday dinner \"out\" I decided it was time for change. After this Christmas experience I will be staying home in future. Either under staffed or just an absent waitress. We all ordered the buffet after viewing it. Salad and soups were good. Got our first plate at buffet and we quickly asked for manager and changed our choice to regular menu. ALL items in buffet were barely warm to cold. Including the prime rib (coldest) which had heat lamps. Ordered steak med/rare and received med/well. As we were leaving and speaking to another couple. They were also stating their disappointment. They also had been coming for Christmas in past and stated they would not be coming back. Same complaints. Very slow service and barely warm food. Save the $65.00 and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"For a \"free\" breakfast (came with my $500 dollar room so not so free)... Total shit.

The Hyatt House in Scottsdale where I once paid $90 had a far superior buffet.

If you love soggy bacon this is for you!

Can't they leave the lid up on their steel bacon holding containers so the moisture doesn't accumulate? Duh.

Like the hotel it is located in, nice scenery doesn't cut it. 

Horrible food. Even the sausage patties were similar to compacted shart."}
{"text":"I came here for a conference at the Biltmore and I had no car so I basically lived at this restaurant. The service was always impeccable and the food was delicious.  

I ate here three times a day for two days and never got bored with the menu. They are accommodating for food allergies and split a meal onto two plates if you are sharing. The food presentation is also always well done which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"You have to walk thru the crowded bar to get to the restaurant. A jazz band was setting up to play so we got a chance to hear it during dinner. We had reservation but for a Friday nite, it wasn't really needed. 

For drinks, I tried the Lavendar & Lemon martini. Frankly, I barely tasted the lavendar and didn't taste any citrus or lemon at all. Don't think I'll get that again. 

I ordered the onion rings for appetizer & one order was enough for 2 to share. Prime rib was cooked perfectly. Came with baked potato and broccoli but we had to ask for sour cream for the baked potato. The Meatloaf was a little different from any meatloaf I've ever had, served on top of pinto beans and spinach. At first glance it didn't look appetizing but it was very moist and flavorful. I would've liked gravy or a sauce to make it more complete but I would order it again as it is. Pumpkin creme brulee for desert was more like pudding than the custard I expected but it was also very good. 

The atmosphere was relaxed and happy. Lighting was low. We had to wait for our eyes to adjust to the candle light before we could read the menu. I heard a few people at a table near us ask for more candles so they could see the menu! 

Service was awesome. We never had to wait for anything and the waiter was always available (but didn't hover) as well as friendly & informative. We never felt rushed and the waiter didn't drop the check til we asked for it. Would definitely come back again. 

Prices are what you'd expect from a high-end resort restaurant with great food, excellent service and wonderful atmosphere. After all. that's what you're actually paying for when you order that $30 prime rib dinner, right? 

Valet parking is free if you tell them you're eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Creative, excellent food with good service, but you'll pay.  I had an amazing mascarpone (not MARscapone, dammit!) stuffed french toast.  Fascinating preparation, as it was served as a \"brick\" (imagine quartering a loaf of bread and then splitting it in half).  Had a honey drizzle, some luscious strawberries and real maple syrup.  Absolutely delicious.  My friend's omelet was equally as tasty.  Setting is gorgeous and service was good.  Only downside is resort pricing -- $11 for the (admittedly excellent) french toast and $4 for coffee (I passed).  Yum."}
{"text":"I guess it's not really the most accessible place, but Frank & Albert's is located in the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa and serves as one of their restaurants to their guests.  Since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods, I decided to come here to have a proper breakfast.

When I asked what they recommended they immediately said \"the Biltmore Benedict\".  I was easily sold so I ordered one, and a coffee.

Cool thing about the coffee is they just bring you a carafe to serve yourself coffee as you please.  Not sure if this was because the waitress was lazy, but I thought it was nice.

The eggs benedict themselves were not the best.  On one hand the ham that they used was overcooked (ie. jerky).  On the other hand the english muffin was over toasted and too crispy, which kinda ruined the overall consistency.

It is a nice patio that they have to sit on, so I will give them that.  They apparently have a bird problem where birds kinda come and scavenge for food.  I didn't really mind it."}
{"text":"This place deserves even more than 5 stars!!! 
My fiancé and me stayed at Biltmore resort in Phoenix for a week. We decided to get all inclusive, so we could relax at this beautiful place and have our meals there, in stead of driving around trying to find new places every day in the city. And OMG we are so happy we did it!!! The food was amazing. We both LOVED every single meal we had there and were super happy with their great service!!! Everyone working there was so nice and friendly, but our favorite was Sherri. That lady deserves all the 5 stars too 
I don't even know where to start with my food reccommendations, but if you are there for breakfast, you gotta try their french toast. It was heaven... 
I highly reccomend this place to everyone. You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Located inside the Biltmore, this place is an awesome restaurant to meet clients or friends for lunch.  I ordered a Margherita Pizza and some Iced Tea.  The Margarita Pizza was superb!  Very good and just the right size too....not too large & not too small.  I left satisfied.  The Iced Tea was very good too....I think I drank 5 or 6 glasses!

Of course, the service was outstanding as well.  It's no wonder why there were several tables and booths with people conducting business....it's a great place for that.

Return Factor - 96%"}
{"text":"Great place to have brunch! The Huevos Rancheros are delicious and the perfect sized-portion to hold you off until lunch and still catch a few extra games. The garden landscape is an amazing view. 

Location is a perfect spot for private business meetings. There is also a private room with great views. The inside decor is up to par of what you expect of the Biltmore and Scottsdale area. 

Recommended brunch!"}
{"text":"If you have are staying at the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix or just happen to be nearby, try Frank & Albert's for both a pleasant and tasty bite to eat. It is located within the Biltmore and they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. I think you will find the menu diverse and inviting with many tempting options. The service is good and the wait staff is attentive, knowledgeable and engaging.

The last time my wife and I ate here was for lunch in May. She had the crab cake sandwich and I ordered a blackened shrimp couscous salad. I also had a glass of the Caymus Conundrum - always very drinkable.

I tried my partner's crab cake sandwich and it was delicious. It included bacon, lettuce and tomato. The sea salt fries are one of my favorites. My shrimp couscous salad consisted of olives, cucumber, roasted tomato, beets with a nice vinaigrette. The shrimp were large and flavorful. 

This restaurant is a good value for your dollar and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Love the foods and servers was friendly... will come back and stay at Az biltmore again"}
{"text":"My in-law's were staying at the Biltmore for the weekend, so we checked out Frank and Albert's for dinner on Sunday night. 
The prices are pretty steep, but it's within a resort so you have to expect your meatloaf dinner to be over $20.
We sampled many different dishes such as the turkey meatloaf with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies within the potatoes, empanadas, pizza and the yummy and not too greasy hamburger served on an English muffin. I found the food to be very good, but a bit pricey. 
Our server Alexis was awesome! She was so friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. 
I didn't get to try any of their desserts, but everything on the dessert menu sounded delicious. 
Despite the high prices I would go back."}
{"text":"Came to the Biltmore for a family Staycation. Took them to F&A on our first night. We were fortunate enough to get Zach as our server (I'd had him on a previous trip out here). Wonderful service, very attentive and a charmer as well. Lots of ma'am and sirs to my hubby and I, young miss and the young gentlemen to our teenage kids. Pampered! Drinks came quickly, water and sodas refilled often. 
The food! My daughter and I split the ribeye with potato gratin. To die for, we were both in heaven! Sauce for the steak was on point, asparagus good but could have used a better trim and a touch of lemon, but that gratin is amazing. Seriously a potato and cream taken to perfection! Hubby had the cheeseburger and fries. He wasn't feeling fancy. But a d@mn decent burger with really good fries. My son was the lucky winner though, with meatloaf of all things! It had to have been 8-10 oz of meatloaf over potato purée, topped with house made chipotle ketchup and fried onion strings. He had the temerity to tell ME! Me! It was better than mine! I made him give me a bite. He wasn't wrong. He wouldn't give me another bite. Jerk! I would have reconsidered my choice of ribeye if not for those potatoes gratin. 
I'm looking forward to the next few nights to explore the rest of the menu. Looking forward to the porkchop or filet mignon. Saw and smelled them as they passed. Very promising!"}
{"text":"The food was SOOO GOOD! You cannot miss out on eating at this place.  There was never a dull moment.  The drinks were GREAT TOO!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour deal- I got a martini for $5, and ordered from their savory bites appetizer menu (4 for $5) and got a whole bunch of food.  It's not a ton, but plenty to fill me up.  If you're starving, order a couple more regular sized appetizers for $5 each.  In any case, I was a happy camper when total bill came out to under $11."}
{"text":"I really love this place, but today they did not bring their \"A\" game. I ordered my favorite for breakfast, the Biltmore Benedict, but instead I was served an impostor with overcooked poached eggs. Service was ehh, but overall everything was just okay, and that's where the disappointment lies."}
{"text":"I took a couple of clients here today for lunch and was surprisingly underwhelmed for a restaurant located in such an established and beautiful hotel.   Service was adequate but the food was overpriced and just not that good.  The french dip was oversalted, but otherwise flavorless; the burger, just a burger.   I eat out almost every day due to my job, and I cannot recommend this restaurant unless you are stuck at the hotel and have no other options."}
{"text":"Overpriced meal options. I had the meatballs. They were burned. My mother had the meatloaf which was decent, but the sauce in top kind of ruined it. My father had the salmon and two sides. His sides were dry and looked burned. His salmon was tiny and burnt on the bottom."}
{"text":"Had a delightful lunch after a trip to the spa with my better half.  Service was a bit slow but good food and good drinks in a casual setting.  Definitely worth checking out if you're staying at the Biltmore or in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had great food and great drinks here twice.  The Biltmore Original is a good one.  We have visited for special occasions with a medium-sized group, and we had a great time.  The service was very good, also."}
{"text":"Revision: Upon receiving the bill, the server, Ines, chose to add $7.00 for spinach and a few baby tomatoes without my consent. I was very upset by this as I dine here several times per month and have never been upcharged like that. She further went on to suggest I was wrong when I told her I have never been upcharged for spinach and tomatoes! At least tell me before hand. She had no right to make that decision. 

Needless to say this is not ok. Perhaps new management choses to encourage staff to uncharge. Not cool management. 

Used to love this place. My favorite is lunch but dinner is also very very good.

I believe there is a new chef as there are a lot of new and improved dishes. 

The lunch Southwest Chicken Salad is my personal favorite. I always ask for  spinach and little baby tomatoes to be added. The dressing is a very light pineapple citrus vinaigrette. (Don't be fooled by the photo, trust me, it's light).

The Sonoran Turkey Club is also excellent.  And huge! You won't leave hungry. The bread is a house made jalapeño infused bread. Not spicy at all but excellent flavor. 

Tip for those doing a pool day-order from F & A first and take to the pool. Better prices and better food in my opinion."}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfest four days in a row during my stay here.  I want to say that Sherri is by far the best server (though there was a black guy who served us one morning that was also awesome!)  There isn't a huge menu here but still you can get pretty much any breakfest food like yogurt, eggs, omelets, pancakes or a buffet.  My husband tried the Mexican pizza and although it was good it did make him sick later in the day.  Each of my times here I had the decaf coffee and it was very good!  I had the omelette twice and another day the Sonoran benedict.  The Sonoron benedict probably was my favorite item- it had eggs benedict over a pulled pork and a nice tomato salsa.  The other day I had the almond cherry foccacia french toast and it was okay.  It was a huge slab of french toast smothered with almond butter.  It was just too rich for me.  I wasn't actually a huge fan of it but it was still okay to try.  I can't speak on Frank & Albert's for lunch or dinner, but if you are staying here it was quick service and the food came out quickly as well."}
{"text":"Decent hotel restaurant. Good food and reasonable service but cocktails were TERRIBLY overpriced. Also beware of the beer offering, some were not really good."}
{"text":"Honestly the food was good, and the service was personable. Had drinks and two meals here and was real pleased with how it came out. Zee, Lisa and bartender Shawn All took very good care of us. The scallop risotto was amazing as were the sandwiches at lunch."}
{"text":"As a guest at the Resort we found this place to be AWESOME! The food is delicious! Happy hour bites, hamburgers,onion rings, and the mac cheese is the BOMB. We also had breakfast. They have a nice breakfast buffet, but we chose to order off the menu. Food was super fresh, and hot. We sat in the bar area, and Shane took great care of us several times. We found all the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended the breakfast tacos, and shredded pork eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"We all enjoyed our lunch here: Cobb Salad and burgers were our choices. Good food and nice friendly staff. Beautiful setting."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner before an event at the Biltmore. We split a few dishes. My absolute favorite was the caprese salad. It had heirloom tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, watercress, celery leaves, and burrata cheese. Burrata cheese can be hard to find friending in eegee's you live, so this was a treat. The pizza and chicken tenders were very good. The chicken tenders were most and flavorful. The service was ok. We were forgotten about after asking for a take home box. If you have a chance, give Frank and Albert's a visit!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.... but you are at the AZ Biltmore, so you had better plan on that.  The service is great, the food is good and the establishment is awesome, especially when you consider how old it is.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast here on Sunday morning;  blazing fires, open patios, absolutely love the ambiance here in the Arizona sunshine.   Both my husband and I had eggs/bacon dishes- hubby said the hash browns are \"to die for\", so don't miss these.  Service was friendly and efficient and our breakfast arrived in just minutes.  Coffee was kept full and we were quite happy with our experience.  It's on the Biltmore property, so expect to pay a little more, ~$45 for two.  Worth it."}
{"text":"A great place for casual eats at the Arizona Biltmore. Our waitress, Justine, made the experience so memorable. Her bubbly personality and enthusiasm made us feel at home. 

The cauliflower steAk was ok but nothing exciting and kind of mushy.

The pretzels with beer cheese were great!

The chicken tortilla soup was bomb!

The shaved Brussel sprout salad was more of a slaw but delicious. 

All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"These reviews are based on happy hour only.  Of the six times I've been here over the last year or so, the first four were four-star worthy and fun, all similar to my initial review below.  The last two times have left me pining, whining, wanting more.  The food has lost some of its luster, slightly dry and uninteresting to the palate (save the calamari, which was still quite good).  The service has become typical, with increasingly distracted and mediocre bartenders.  Come on F&A!  Make me re-re-review you back up a star!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice during our stay at the Biltmore, both for lunch and we left full and happy after both visits!

This is the casual restaurant on site, and offers indoor dining areas, a covered patio and outdoor patio as well, for those that like to watch kitchen action, one dining area offers stadium views of the kitchen. TV available in the dining area around the bar. So basically you can pick to suit your mood.

Seated outside where we could enjoy the weather and the view, our service was friendly, efficient and paced to match our wind-down mode. We enjoyed a glass of white and rose with the mind blowing soft pretzel and cheese dip as well as the salad and sandwich choices. 

The wine list is wallet friendly and offers a variety of reds, whites and rose, and the menu has something for all.

They also serve breakfast if you prefer sit down to the cafe or room service.

Nice place!"}
{"text":"I was excited to go here for breakfast on Saturday and wish I would have spent my money somewhere else. The buffet was something I wouldn't expect from the Biltmore it was extremely disappointing. It felt like a Holiday inn buffet but they did have an omelette chef. The bacon quality was not great and it was swimming in inches of grease the fruit looked bad. For $24 it was worth about $10. For $30 make your way to the Four Seasons Scottsdale for the weekend buffet and you will be blown away double the size with great specialty items. The view alone is worth the drive. Maybe they could take a lesson from them. Service was good but the food was not."}
{"text":"We went the other night for dinner before fireworks.  The food tasted fine however the service was horrendous! And since we can go to so many other places in town for great food AND great service why go back!!?  The server had been there for 3 mos. (that seems like a long enuf time to get acclimated?!) He didn't listen to a word any of us said! We'd say one thing and he'd do another! Our food came out wrong & at different times! It was ridiculous!! We will not be going back!!  Surprising for a restaurant located in a world class resort to be so lousy!!  The Biltmore should be ashamed!!"}
{"text":"It's not often that I would give a resort restaurant a good review.  Probably because we usually stray from them because they are often a billion dollars by the time you leave the place.

We decided upon dinner here while staying at the Biltmore for the Hell City Convention.  Since we live in town, I know the area pretty well so our options were anything in the Biltmore area or Frank & Alberts.  I had passed by the menu earlier and figured we'd try it.

We showed up about 6-7ish for dinner and there was no wait, but plenty of people inside.   We were nicely sat right next to the kitchen and almost instantly our drink orders were taken by the smiling Elizabeth. After our drinks we ordered our food and within 20min, our food was out.

While waiting for our food they gave us some bread and a couple dips that were delicious.  One was a chipotle ketchup and the other was a green olive aole type drip.  Both great.  We ordered some onion rings that came stacked in a nice formation along with some buttermilk ranch.  We all ate a few of those, but had saved more for later.

it was dinner time..  

One of our friends had eaten so he grabbed a dessert that he said was one of the best he's ever eaten.  My girlfriend and I ordered the prime rib.  For $25, I thought this was a great price for such a fancy establishment.   I haven't had this tasty of a prime rib cut in a long time.  Every bite was better than the next.  Along with that was a huge piece of broccoli and a nicely cooked baked potato.  The meal was amazing.

But the meal was just a part of it..  Our server Elizabeth would always drop by to make sure we had what we needed.  They were so on top of things, if they over heard us comment on something, they would rush over to make sure we had it.  The staff was ridiculously nice and even the chef came out to check on our food.  I don't think I've ever had a better experience at a restaurant like  I did here.   Frank & Alberts knows food and knows how to take care of their customers.  Well done.

We loved this place so much that we werent here three times during our stay this past weekend."}
{"text":"Very friendly wait staff tended to our every need. Had a nice table outside by the fire for a relaxing casual dinner.  Caesar salad was excellent, as was the \"famous\" tortilla soup.  The Traditional Pizza with pepperoni, sausage and ham was great. Meal was so good we had a \"repeat\" served at the bar two nights later!"}
{"text":"I honestly cannot understand how some restaurants can feel good about being open.   Today I took my family to Frank & Alberts for my dads 77th birthday.   

We have small children, 8 and 6, so we ordered wine for us and their food.   40 minutes later the Food was brought out.   The Wien came about 20 minutes after that.   

In truth, the food was fine but took forever.    The server was in the weeds and to management's discredit, he was left to his own devices to try and get caught up.   

Since I am here for a week, probably have to try again but not looking forward to it."}
{"text":"This was not a pleasant experience. The hotel was over run with 900 hospitality event attendees filling every nook and cranny with loud conventioneers. The restaurant was noisy so we asked the hostess to seat us in a quieter spot. She took us to a table right in the middle....probably the loudest spot in there. We then asked our waitress to move us which she did.
The food is expensive but that is to be expected for the Biltmore.  But it is over priced for the quality and the small portions. My crab cake BLT was $18 and was cold and greasy. The fries were the saving grace, being crisp and delicious.
T. Cooks at Royal Palm or  Elements at The Sanctuary are far better hotel restaurant alternatives. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary comes with garnish of salami, pepperoncini, big shrimp, olive and a mozarella ball.  Ya, I'll take this over a celery.  

Pass on the celery ceaser salad...good idea, not so good on taste.  Everything else was delicious."}
{"text":"First of service is slow.  Food was ok but over priced.  Lastly make sure you check your bill cuz they automatically add 18% gratuity to it."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight for the first time in ages. I really enjoyed this place. The service was great and the food was wonderful. We had a calamari appetizer, which was breaded with panko. Very good although the dipping sauce was a little ketchup-y. Probably wouldn't order it again. Had the tortilla soup-fabulous and one of the best I've ever had. We also had a duck and goat cheese pizza which was awesome and the crust was perfect. There's a lot of kvetching on here about the prices, but this is a high end resort so what do you expect?"}
{"text":"Would love to see them offer healthy options.  Whole wheat pasta, salads with lite dressings and more vegetarian vegan options would be great!   The biscuits with sausage gravy, shake and bake pork, double stuffed potatoes and pizza are great, but will kill you eventually."}
{"text":"Had a great prime rib dinner on friday night.  Ordered rare and it was perfect.  The service was a little slow.  We were seated quickly but it took a long time to have someone come by and get our drink order.  The table across from us came later and got drinks before we even ordered ours."}
{"text":"Good menu with lots of options.  Service was fast and friendly.  It was a hot day and there was plenty of shade and misters to keep it cool."}
{"text":"They have the best pork chops and hamburgers I've ever eaten! Servers are nice. John was very friendly and personable. This place is my go-to for a hot date."}
{"text":"Frank & Alberts is on-site at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel so you're probably coming here because your company is paying for your room and you don't have a car.

Lucky for you it's delicious. Service was great, food was great, drinks were great so everything is great.

When I was in my room I noticed that they had a short rib mac & cheese on the room service menu. I got a hankering for this mac & cheese so when we came to the restaurant to eat I expected it to be on the menu, however it was not. Guess what? They made it for me anyway. It was delicious.

The cheesecake is made in house and I highly recommend it. You should come here."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times had the most amazing salad-- the A&H, which is a cabbage slaw with BBQ chicken and nuts. It's just the right combinations of sweet and crunchy and still light. My husband had the Caesar with Shrimp and no croutons (he's on Atkins) and to his delight they have fried Parmesan crisps so he could still get some crunch without breaking his diet. Sit out on the indoor patio which lets you have both the sun and the AC!"}
{"text":"We have lived in the Biltmore area for many years but did not go to Wrights or the Coffee Shop because it was not as good as other options.  The rework has been successful.  The Prime Rib in this location is better than the Fountain Bleu in Miami Beach.  Eat in the bar for a relaxed meal and cordial atmosphere.  
The portions are big and the price is more than reasonable.  A wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an awesome beer dinner last night at Frank & Albert's. They were featuring the Stone Brewing Co with this meal, one of my faves so we had to partake. Very decently prices, $45/person for a 5 course meal. Chef Jon was hosting the meal, and he knocked it out of the park. We were greeted in the room but the servers, Chef Jon, and the Stone Brewery rep, and this HUGE charcuterie table, covered with dried fruits, meats from all over, amazing cheese (the mango cheddar was the best!), and all kinds of crackers and bread. We were enjoying it so much and listening to Chef Jon tell us all about his selections to pair with the beer that we nearly filled up on the cheese and meat. Each course was paired perfectly with the beer they were featuring. Chef Jon explained each course perfectly and added the highlights of where the product came from, most everything was locally grown, very cool! The main course was the whole roasted pig that was on display all night. Chef's knife skills were truly on display with this task, I think he broke the animal down in less than 20 min, ready to serve, he put on quite a show. The main dish was served with espresso infused forbidden rice, colorful veggies, house made apple sauce and gravy. Each perfect. I said to my friend, the sign of a great chef is when there is no need for salt or pepper on anything, and this hit the spot! I have never participated in a beer dinner or a chef hosted dinner before, this was so much fun. Nice to get to know the chef and his take on food and how he prepares. It's obvious he is in the right field, food is his life, and rightful so. I am excited to see more from him in the future."}
{"text":"Food is really good but expensive. They were going under renovations when we visited but everything was still working. Service was a little slow but workable. Nicely decorated, decent ambiance."}
{"text":"The breakfast here was amazing - wonderful oatmeal with cherry brulee.  The breakfast buffet was also excellent.  However, I give this restaurant two stars because of the dinner we had the night prior to the great breakfast.  The signature lemon lavender martini was very disappointing, as they were fresh out of lavender so they brought me a basic lemon drop martini.  The waiter highly hyped the lemon chicken that came with the \"best mashed potatoes he'd ever had\", so I ordered that.  The chicken (which was claimed to have been marinated in lemon all night long) had zero lemon taste to it.  Zero.  It was simple rotisserie chicken - good flavor but not what it claimed to me.  The mashed potatoes - I took one bite and without saying anything about them I had my fiance taste them.  His reaction was, \"they taste like instant potatoes\", which was exactly my thought!!!!!!  I was stunned since they were so hyped.  If I stay at the Biltmore again I definitely would not eat dinner here - I would try the nicer restaurant on the property or go off property."}
{"text":"I was a little underwhelmed by this place.  

I will say that knowing the price of the food and this places location I was expecting an amazing restaurant.  When I walked in however I could tell that the place hasn't received a makeover in quite some time.  The fabric on the seats was all worn out and the interior didn't seem very fresh, seems like it could use a little TLC.

That being said...the food was good.  Split a flat bread, fries, and a queso dip with my cousin.  All three items were tasty. The fries are the only thing that really stick out to me as they were fried in duck fat, which was truly amazing.  I also had a gin and tonic that was mixed very well.  The service was also very good. 

The only reason I am giving the place only two stars is really the price.  I dont feel like the food necessarily lived up to the price. Luckily I was there with someone who had a gift certificate."}
{"text":"I'd like to give 3.5 stars. It's not just \"A-OK\" but it's not exactly my first choice either.

We were treated to dinner here last night by boyfriend's visiting aunt and her S.O.

- The atmosphere was very nice; we sat in the room with the \"Great Glass Fireplace\" in the center and floor-to-ceiling windows all around, with a view of the fountain.
- They offered local craft beer selections (including Nimbus, Oak Creek and Four Peaks - yay!) at a reasonable $6.
- Extensive dessert menu; none of this 4 or 5 choices, this thing was a whole page by itself.
- The dark chocolate brulee was (I should say is, I'm eating the leftovers right now) AMAZING. Sugar burnt perfectly, like when you toast the edge of a marshmallow, rich dark chocolate, raspberries. So good!


Negatives:
- Menu was pretty limited - fine dining restaurants are usually limited, but not with a bunch of relatively boring options; their limited offerings usually  have enough interesting twists that you can find SOMETHING that jumps out at you. Not here. Fried chicken and mac and cheese and meatloaf? Odd. 
- My entree (the trout) and boyfriend's (pasta with shrimp) were just OK. The trout and shrimp were cooked nicely but the flavors lacked something. Maybe more lemon on mine? It did refer to it as \"braised lemon\"...
- Service was a little awkward - the waitress asked if she could start us off with some waters and we all said \"Uh... sure?\"  It wasn't the water offering, it was that it was like she was selling us on the waters instead of real drinks. She didn't seem to really know anything about the menu either - she went around the table and her description of each of our orders was that they were very good or really popular. I was amused that she was treating me as the \"Alpha 'of the table - guess I was intimidating, heehee.
- $6 for a domestic draft is pushing it, especially with craft beers being the same price.
- Bathrooms are light years and eons away, OUTSIDE of the restaurant. Weird."}
{"text":"The food here is only slightly better than Denny's, but at resort prices.  My fried buffalo chicken sandwich was not fully cooked in the middle and the fried mac & cheese app was barley warm and a little soggy.  The kitchen staff seemed irritated that I sent the chicken back - they have an open kitchen so I could see the reaction of the chef when my waitress returned the chicken.

The restaurant was not busy on the Saturday afternoon that I visited, but the hostess was MIA when my party arrived.  We waited for about five minutes before I asked a server in the dinning room to get the hostess to seat my party and the party that had arrived before us.  Really not acceptable.  Our waitress, however, was very friendly and attentive.

I'm a local, so I won't be returning to Frank & Albert's; I think the only people that eat here are those staying at the resort, convenience is really the only reason to go here."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  Not bad for a hotel restaurant but expensive for what you get.  I was here for a conference for a week and had to eat here about 6 times.  2 of the 6 meals were good.  The best was the pizza.  I would only eat here if you are staying here and can not get out."}
{"text":"Frank and Al's is a nice place, it really is.  It's probably too classy in fact.  In exchange for the right to stay in the bar, Frank and Al reciprocate with prices that are ten to twenty percent too high.  I left after an hour spending close to a hundred dollars.  For that I ate nachos with chicken, three beers and two shots of high end booze.  Was it worth it? Depends.   I'll probably never go back because I live far away.  If I lived here I wouldn't go back because I tend to drink too much.  Quick summary, drunks stay away."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Arizona Biltmore and our package comes with lunch and dinner. Our certificates have allowed us to eat VERY well and not exceed our 'allowance'. The outdoor seating is great, especially near the fireplace. We would highly recommend the Tortilla Soup and the Rotisserie Chicken Salad for lunch and we enjoyed many great dinner entrees. Even thought it isn't on the menu, ask for the Falling Water drink....yum!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great way to spend Easter morning!

After taking part in the egg hunt on the main grounds (and BTW, they know how to do it here: Massive dumps of eggs full of goodies. More than the kids could carry. Plenty of photo ops. Parents who weren't acting out scenes from Soylent Green.) we made our way to this nicely upscale coffee shop/casual dining spot. 

We were seated 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, keeping my little guy from popping a gasket. I chose the $19 breakfast buffet, and considering it included a custom-made omelette with organic ingredients--as well as juice and coffee--it was a steal. 

Service was wonderful and the staff was sure to make us feel at home. Well, actually better than home because I don't have people looking after my every whim and need while at home."}
{"text":"As the famous Biltmore brunch was not available (remodeling the dining room) this was our next runner up - at $20 the breakfast buffet was a steal for such high quality ingredients. The Bloody Mary was no slouch at $9 either."}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant located inside the Biltmore resort. It's their more casual restaurant compared to Wrights.  It's a great place to have a few apps or meal after sipping on too many Martinis at the Wright Bar.  The staff is pleasant and right on top of your next drink order.  The few times we've dined here we've had delicious food but their menu does change.  The have the coolest looking bread sticks that resemble wheat stalk and is always paired with lip smacking dips that are unique and robust in flavors.  We had the pork empanadas and risotto ravioli. All was super delicious.  A great place to sit back and unwind and enjoy who you're with."}
{"text":"Let's see ... The restaurant is great & the famous architecture is a nice touch for the scenery. The food is very average. Caesar salad was covered with too much dressing and the sea bass was too well done. Coconut custard pie for dessert wasn't bad. I would still suggest coming to check out the Biltmore where Frank and Alberts is located. It's worth the trip to see this famous property."}
{"text":"Sad to say, nothing impressive here. I had family staying at the Biltmore so we ate here. A tasteless hamburger similar to Fry's grocery store meat. Salad was no different then anywhere. I don't know where the reviewers normally eat but this place has nothing special to offer."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Frank and Alberts when my family came to visit and stayed at the Biltmore. Great service and a nice atmosphere. The food received mixed reviews by our table. Three people in our party ordered the caesar salad after the waiter highlighted it. Their special twish was celery, which we all assumed was mixed in for extra crunch. It turns out the entire salad is shaved celery. The celery was just way too stringy and fibrous to really enjoy, plus it watered down the flavor of the caesar dressing. Nice attempt at a twist, but I would say leave that classic alone. 

On the positive side, I did really enjoy the burger - great flavor and the homemade chipotle ketchup was awesome (they also have homemade tarragon mustard). My cousin had the meatloaf which looked amazing. He's a 6'2' 16 year old athlete with a refined palate... I didn't even have a chance to ask for a bite before he devoured it, but he said it was awesome. 

My experience here was good (hence the A-OK rating), but didn't leave me wanting come back for more. What did, however, was their happy hour menu: lots of great looking deals for $5. I'll have to head over for hh and will update my review."}
{"text":"This wonderful Frank Lloyd Wright inspired restaurant sits at the Arizona Biltmore hotel. Walk right in and you'll be taken into a time capsule where Frank Lloyd Wright ruled the architectural century. The floors, furniture, ceiling, menu, even down to the color temperature this place will take you back in time and make you feel like you're inside one of the FLW case study houses. Sit in the lobby, close your eyes
Now on to the food- everything was lovely. The chicken sandwich was great, the fries were good but could have used another dash of salt. Tomato soup and grilled cheese were also a great choice. I'd love to come back here next time I'm visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"Family dinner out on the patio by the fireplace on a perfect March evening can't get much better then that but wait! there's more.  We ordered calamari for an appetizer. It was perfectly fried not greasy at all with a side of  delicious cocktail sauce. I ordered a small organic caesar you get a choice of celery root or organic regular. I chose the celery and it was delicious, perfect portion. If you like more lettuce then get the regular caesar. Then I ordered the chicken and goat cheese desert flat bread pizza. It was more than I could eat but I sure tried to finish it. It was delicious nice moist chicken with the tang of the goat cheese and sweet figs. The desert flat bread was a nice alternative to a regular pizza dough. Great combination of ingredients. All in all a great experience! Katy was our server she was attentive but not breathing down our necks. I cant' wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We are staying at the Biltmore, so Frank & Albert's will see us many times during our 4 night stay.

Spinach salad - Very good.  It came with a ton of cranberries and walnuts.  No skimping here.  I would order it again.
Pretzel appetizer - The cheese was great, but the pretzel was a pretzel bread and too dense.  I would not order this again.
Steak & Eggs - Flat Iron steak was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  Eggs were cooked perfectly as well.  I would definitely get this again.

Chicken and waffles - The chicken was great.   The corn puree was excellent.   The waffles were good.  3 waffles and 2 pieces of chicken.   The jalapeno maple syrup is a little spicy. If you're not big eaters,  you can split it with a small side.  

French toast - 4 pieces.   You can get a side dish and split everything.   It was OK.  I'd go with the chicken and waffles instead."}
{"text":"We had two amazing lunches and dinners here during a 3 day stay at The Biltmore. Everything was just perfect from service  to the food. They accommodated plant based/gluten free without a second thought; the servers and chef were very knowledgeable. The brussel sprout/cauliflower salad was exceptional!! Don't miss the table side s'mores! Everything was just fabulous."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great but the food is pricey and it is a little more than OK but not great. They do have happy hour drinks but not on all food items. We came here mainly to see the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright."}
{"text":"I have had a great experience every time I have been there.  The food is hard to beat and the service was pleasant.  

Portions are reasonable, not huge (I'm a big feller), and I was satified every time I ate there.  

Very pleasant environment, clean, spacious and calm."}
{"text":"So we ate here twice-Dinner was pretty much terrible. I had a salad that was beyond bland with basically no dressing. My entree was the short rib. It was about 2 oz of meat and attached was a 3 oz blob of fat. Pretty gross! Breakfast- a little better but tiny portions with burnt potatoes. I'm being king with the 2 star...."}
{"text":"Very good. They have wonderful food there. I had a great corned beef sandwich and Steven M was a super waiter. For dinner I had their prime rib which was a great deal for $21 with a big baked potato and broccoli and then a chocolate chip cookie for lunch, our server Zach was a very nice guy ad did a great job. Kudos to the Biltmore"}
{"text":"My mother in law hosted my baby shower at Frank & Alberts. The atmosphere was perfect. We were given the outside area where they had two long tables set up around the fire pit. It was January so we did have the fire pit on and it was a nice touch. There were roses on the tables along with a couple of flower arrangements. It looked beautiful!

We had pre-selected a couple of menu items, but most people opted for the brunch. As far as brunches go, it was just average. There were several choices, but it was limited for the price. I did like the made to order omelet bar and fresh fruit.

I give them 4 stars because they were friendly and did such a nice job with the set up for my shower. However, if I had only gone for brunch, it would likely be more of a 3 star experience."}
{"text":"Ate here for the TG holiday. I always give folks a pass on the holiday, so giving it 3 stars, not 2. Not up to Waldorf snuff. Food was ok. The tortilla soup was good, but it came out 20 minutes earlier than my husband's soup. 
Did the buffet for the holiday. Food was decent but was barely warm. Our waiter came by often but never cleared any plates. He kept rushing us to the buffet, trying to get us to get our mains before we got our soup, etc. 
we had our menus and two courses finished with plates still on the table. He asked it he could drop the bill when my husband ordered coffee. When he brought the coffee, he told us it was the last cup and he was brewing another and he could get us to go cups with the fresh batch. The stale cup was full of coffee grounds. We were so disappointed, we just tabbed out and left since he kept hurrying us. 
Was a $230 tab for fixed price meal, wine, coffee and auto-grat. 
Was disappointed because it was also our anniversary. Shit meal."}
{"text":"1 stars because of the service. I ordered the chicken and the inside was raw! The guac was old and fries were soggy. For a 5 star hotel the quality of the food was nothing short of a disgrace! I only hope I don't get salmonella poisoning. Frank Lloyd Wright would not be happy if he was still around !"}
{"text":"Ate here three times based on a Fodor's review of the tortilla soup, but found that the whole dining experience was below average at best.  3 things made it average to below average.  My order was mixed up 2 of the 3 times I dined there.  The quality of food (in particular the tortilla soup) was just okay-again only average.  Also, the service was slow, though they seemed to have ample staff.  Those are the cons that make me rate it as only 2 stars (and trust me, living in the Biltmore neighborhood the location was convenient where I wanted to love it).

What is exceptional about the restaurant were the grounds surrounding it.  The architecture and design is what you would expect from Frank Lloyd Wright-excellent with sharp lines and open design :).  Check out Taliesen in Scottsdale if you want the Frank Lloyd Wright experience!"}
{"text":"Very open and beautiful ambiance. I like patio dining and scenery while eating. 

The best thing I remember was the oil and bread. They offered like 3 different spice mixes. My favorite was the oil and pesto."}
