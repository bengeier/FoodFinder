{"text":"I just had the most amazing meal... their #14 Carne Asada combo platter.  There wasn't one bad thing on the generous plate (and I devoured everything).  The waitress who took care of me made great suggestions and was very attentive throughout my meal.  Need great Mexican food near the airport?... stop looking around... this place is a gem!  I'll definitely come back... hungry!!!"}
{"text":"I try to avoid going to mcdonalds thats why i eat here most of the time but the quality of their food seems to get worse everyday. Today i went there to get an asada burrito and when i got back to my work and opened my order, the burrito was torn up and loose, so loose that the contents of the burrito was everywhere. Tried to rewrap it but theres just no hope for that burrito."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday afternoon - many options and great flavors. The staff was very courteous, but the atmosphere left more to be desired. Overall it surpassed expectations."}
{"text":"Great local find!!! Family owned business with quality food and ingredients. They make their own aguas frescas and ice cream too! You cannot go wrong with anything you order here!!!"}
{"text":"Esquites is over cooked and flavorless! Second time trying it hoping I just had a bad batch last visit."}
{"text":"I was excited to try their hot cheetos corn in a cup, it looked delicious from their yelp pics. Complete disappointment! All it is, is corn soup with some hot cheetos drizzled over it. I've never seen that much water or juice or whatever it is in a corn cup. Only bright side to my visit was a bag of Crujitos."}
{"text":"I liked my overall experience i. This eatery.

I had the seafood tostada. While I didn't like the tostada shell the seafood was so fresh. It had small marinated shrimp, diced onions, cucumbers and fresh cilantro. It was tasty."}
{"text":"This is the first place I eat when I get to Vegas and when I go home I dream of the food I ate here. The food here is so good that if you are on the strip and you don't have a rental car figure out the public transportation to get here or walk because you'll need to burn off the calories. I have two foods that I discovered here and they are fantastic here that I try everywhere else I can get them: Mamey and Chicharrón.

Get the Mamey Aguas frescas and as an ice cream too. Both of these are made here and the Aguas frescas are made every morning! Then get the Chicharrón in your favorite style, gordita, sope or taco. Soooooooo good! Food adventure all over the menu here, the staff is incredibly helpful and will guide you to the perfect meal to put you into a food coma."}
{"text":"Best prices in town for elotes, mangonada and all Mexican snacks you can think of. Also the taste is great in all I have tasted from here. The staff is quick and get food ready by the time you get to the cashier. This location also has tortas, tacos and other Mexican good items. They have plenty of seats and tables so it's never too crowded. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We strolled toward Marianas after dinner at the Crab Corner, and are very glad we had the nerve to come in.  English was spoken by the workers but it was definitely Mexican in clientele.  There is an outdoor taco stand on the sidewalk in front of it.

Great exotic ice cream flavors: corn, dragon fruit, cheese, rose petals.  I had a fruit ice called sepote that was delicious.  

Look at the pictures that somebody took and posted here on Yelp, come in and order something you've never had before.  

My wife had butter pecan, which they called nuez, and it was great.  Very rich and creamy.

The scoops are $2.50, $3.50 & $4.50, and the prepared dessert plates called funny cake, banana hawaiiana and banana split, etc., all pictured on the wall behind the counter, are $5.75. 

There are also a selection inside of pelotas, which appear to be exotic, handmade popsicles, but with textures. 

Delicious!"}
{"text":"I went in for a chamango and they truly do make the best in town!! Extremely nice people here."}
{"text":"I went here for a work meeting and was amazed by the happy staff. I met the owners Jesse and Vickie. They were very personable and inviting. All the ice cream is made on site and the food is great. Even though the breakfast burrito isn't on their 40+ item menu, they made it for me. They are so nice and fun. I would recommend having ice cream for dessert. I had the strawberry and it was bomb! Please visit and you will be a returning customer in no time. 

Low prices, great food. Awesome atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, salsas good as well. Nice folks too. Muy Bueno!  Had the carnitas, adobado, and carne asada.  Rice and beans, too.  Excellent"}
{"text":"There Chamango was the bomb! Love that they add ice-cream in it too .... chamoy icecream was so delicious !! My first time at this place and its so far the best, and great customer service as well. thank you for the great Chamango this evening ."}
{"text":"Simply awesome!!  Worth the drive - excellent food - the carne and pollo asado are great!  And the ices and ice creams are superb. The avocado chip dip is to die for!!"}
{"text":"As a self-appointed menudo aficionado, this cozy little spot has hands down the top five menudos I've had *globally*. They always say with any cultural food \"the hole-in-the-walls always have the best ____ food\", and this is a prime example. It hardly stops there. The same love and attention lends itself across the board, from chips to chimichangas.  The owner is an absolute pleasure, whose warm personality and cheery presence just adds to the overall experience. So go out of your way if you have to; this cozy corner cochina is not one to miss!"}
{"text":"Very good portion for my 3 scoops I ordered. Unfortunately for me, I didn't try them first so I didn't care for my flavor selection (chamoy, tamarind, dragonfruit). Had some interesting flavors (queso flavor?) I'll go back for sure, many interesting flavors to try."}
{"text":"Two Separate Business in one place! The Ice Cream is to die for. Not to sweet and really tastes tropical. Tried the Chamango and the best one I've had so far. The amount of Lucas and Amount of mango is perfect. It's not too much. definitely coming back for the Chamango."}
{"text":"The staff were super friendly and accommodating, I just wish what I ordered matched. I ordered a carne asada burrito, meat wasn't as flavorful as other places, lots of tortilla...the chamango was small and probably the worst I've had...the mango tasted old. There were plenty of sketchy characters dining because of the area, which made me nervous and there was a smell that made me lose my appetite. Props to the workers for being wonderful but I won't be back because I what I was there for disappointed me."}
{"text":"I got the corn with hot cheeto dust in a cup or whatever and i expected the corn to have the mayo and stuff like in the middle and the top of the cup but it only had a little drizzle on the top and i was so disappointed , but the only reason i gave this place 3 stars is because the strawberry horchata was out of this world bombbb"}
{"text":"Wow I finally found a five star!!!! I've been to Vegas about 7 times & the last 3 yrs I've come here. I discovered the water the owners makes fresh everyday!! I don't care what ails you this water makes it all good. He makes about 7 different flavors. Everything is hand made from the water to the frozen treats to the ice cream to the food. The guy works non stop! The tacos are eye rolling! Oh my goodness!!!! I'm sitting here writing my review going down memory lane in my mind!! I go & get water almost everyday I'm in Vegas. He need to find a way to ship it to me!! Lol & yes I'm working on it. The cucumber, lime, grass, & Chai seeds is my favorite & ALWAYS the first to sell out."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Delicious street tacos, delicious aguas frescas, and unique ice cream flavors.  The place is clean and the customer service exceptional."}
{"text":"I was at the supermarket and saw this place nearby so I gave it a try and their chamango is so good!! highly recommended. Ill be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great place! Ice cream was good. Had to try the hot Cheeto corn, and it was really good. People were friendly. Will have to visit again."}
{"text":"Really good I recommend. I got the tostilocos, Ice cream, fresh fruit, and pineapple water. Didn't expect it to be as good as it was! Their cooked food is also delicious gives you a home cooked feel and it's a lot better than going to a Mexican food place. Will be back! 
PS. Try the Aguas Frescas won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Mom and pop eatery with Mexican deserts and appetizers. Had the elote in a cup and it was delicious.  Will come back to try other items off the menu."}
{"text":"Looking for a good antojistos place with wonderful delicious food come here the even you plantains for the sundae just DELICIOUS"}
