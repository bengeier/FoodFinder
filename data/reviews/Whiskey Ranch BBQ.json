{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying out WR Food Truck this weekend at the Art Festival and I think they did a great job of handling the crowd in an efficient manner. 
We ordered pulled chicken sandwich but got delicious chopped grilled chicken breast without sauce so we could dress it ourselves...they must have ran out of the pulled version. The beans were delicious but their coleslaw leaves a lot to be desired. 
Overall I give them 4 stars for good effort. Everyone likes their coleslaw differently. I would definitely eat their food again."}
{"text":"Whisky Ranch BBQ catered our event today. They were excellent to work with! On time, friendly, and went above and beyond to make sure everything went smoothly. From set up to tear down, it was like watching an artist paint a masterpiece. They even offered to assist people with food allergies! 

Now the food.....you have to have drank too much whisky to think anything negative about their food! I could not get enough of their beans!!! They were sent from heaven on a gold platter for me to devour! I was able to try their brisket, chicken, potatoes, green beans, and beans. It was all phenomenal! 

I would not hesitate to book them for our next event!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BBQ I have had. Recently had them cater an event for both breakfast and lunch. The scramble they made in the morning was out of this world. For lunch, they made brisket, chicken, and pulled pork. So so good. They had a few different sauces. The hot bbq sauce was phenomenal. Not too spicy but just enough to get a nice burn. Meat was juicy and tender and seasoned perfectly. The side were nice too. Potatoes, green beans, and baked beans. All were spot on with flavor. 

The crew set up like ninjas. All of the sudden, you smelt a heavenly aroma and realized lunch was set up. Didn't hear them come in once! 

This company is clean, organized, friendly, helpful, and out of this world. If I could give them more stars, I would. 

Do yourself a favor and book them for every event you have. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Whiskey Ranch has catered lunch at my work several times now. Cannot express how tasty their food is!! The first time I had the pulled pork. Super moist and juicy, great flavor. The second time, though...PHENOMENAL. The brisket is INSANE. It completely fell apart on the bun and in my mouth. Killer. The sides are like your mama makes it! Good ol' down-home coleslaw and baked beans. The potato salad is my personal fave. Friendly, fast service with unbeatable taste! Come back to Bell Mortgage anytime!"}
{"text":"Sadly, we didn't even get to taste their food. Our business booked them for an event and they did not show up. We were told they were broke down and going to send their 'second truck'..by the food truck 'concierge' we were using. Then the story changed to they were in an accident and truck was on the way... No truck. I emailed and called at least 3 times receiving no answer. No show, no call... just a text after our event was over. I would like to see proof of the accident...since the stories seemed to be conflicting and truly terrible customer experience. I won't be booking this truck or recommending it to anyone that has an event they need them to show up for. Just sad. Even if there was an accident, a phone call would have been the one thing you could have done."}
{"text":"Great People, Excellent Food and Catering. Jen and tommy did an amazing Job"}
{"text":"I am consistently blown away by their food! Always incredible! Love their brisket and burgers the best! Friendly staff and fast service as well! Love them!!!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, food trucks were only expected to be convenient.  Everyone knew the food would be only so-so -- after all, how good could you cook in a truck.  But nowadays, food truck food can be, and often is, fresh, tasty, well-prepared, and delicious.  

Not so for Whiskey Ranch BBQ, at least not when I experienced it at the Scottsdale Art Festival.  The main problem was the brisket, which they served chopped into tiny cubes, completely ruining the texture of the meat.  Furthermore it was grainy and a bit chewy.  The beans were overly-sweet, and the potato salad an odd combination of mayo and vinegar flavors, possibly a bit spoiled.  Only the BBQ sauce and the paint job on the truck were top notch."}
