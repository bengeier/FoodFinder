{"text":"I'm from Toronto who's visiting Calgary. I love eating out and tried a few restaurants here in Calgary since we arrived here and I can honestly say that it's shocking how expensive Filipino restaurants here. 

As usual I love checking reviews in Yelp before trying them and last Sunday I went with my partner and her sister for lunch at Mama Nita's Binalot. The place is small but well lit. Since we're only 3 people we just ordered the single menu and not the package they have good for 6-10 people. 

I ordered Sisig with rice, hard boil egg and tomato, my partner ordered Daing with rice, hard boil and slice of tomato and her sister ordered sinigang with rice, hard boil and slice tomato. Before the our orders came, the waitress served us with sinigang soup. The soup was so tasty, perfect hot temperature but too salty.

The price was so reasonable a lot better and affordable than any other restaurants we've dine. The taste of the food was delicious and my Sisig was not oily like other restaurants serve.  The customer service was also great.  The reason why I didn't give 5 star is because of the salty sinigang soup. 

Also what I've noticed was they don't have vegetables on the menu, so for those people whose vegetarian this place is not for you.  Oops I forgot to mention that the owner (I think) when I raise the issue about no vegetables, he mentioned that you can create your own menu meaning you can call them ahead of time if you want vegetables, like Pinakbet, Chopseuy etc. 

So for sure I will definitely recommend this restaurant and will definitely go back."}

{"text":"First off, I'm not sure why Mama Nita's Binalot is reported as \"closed\" on Yelp? My boyfriend and I just went two days ago. It's also on google maps and skipthedishes.com 
Just so you know :) Don't miss out on this great little place.

I'm not Filipino nor have I grown up around Filipino culture but my boyfriend is from the Philippines and he's who introduced me to the Filipino food world and I can't get enough. 
I've tried lots of Filipino restaurants in Los Angeles as well as my boyfriend's family's cooking (also in LA) but this is only the second place we've tried now in Calgary. 

We were happyish with our lunch. We ordered a ton of food because we wanted to try a variety of their cooking (and we were really hungry...) 
My boyfriend wasn't too wow'd but of what we've tried in Calgary, this is the best so far.

The boodle feast looks fun though!"}
{"text":"Okay hopefully my request to fix the name of this restaurant goes through...and maybe someday someone will explain what a Binalot is...in the meantime I plan to go back for sure!

We decided to do a massive group lunch for work and we went without knowing what we were getting into...I think there was approximately 25-26 of us...

We were seated at a super long table covered in banana leaves and the staff were in the middle of putting soup down at each place setting.  As we drank up the light but flavourful broth soup they dropped scoops of rice in a line down the middle and it just got crazier from there.

There were slices of pork, beef, bbq chicken, hard boiled eggs, tomato wedges, roasted eggplant, whole tilapia, chunks of another kind of fish I never got the name of, and glass noodles.

The dipping sauce bowls we each got turned out to be adobo sauce which is like an acidic soysauce, delicious with the handfuls of stuff.

The chicken was amazing and i could have eaten a whole one, the noodles were tasty, and everything was just outright delicious (except the whole eggs which I didn't try - I don't really like eggs outside of certain preparations usually done by myself or mom).

The fun part about all this was you picked up with one hand (your 'clean hand') and you ate with the other...it was messy, fun, and an amazing experience.  The flavours were fantastic, though the whole tilapia was interesting...after a while it tasted the way an aquarium smells but it was delicious anyway - just something to get used to.  Isn't that the best part of food? Experimenting with things you'd never think you'd enjoy eating and finding out you love it?

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a great inexpensive meal here. No utensils! Washing your hands is very necessary for this meal. A cool experience. Meal was delicious. Wish there was an option for utensils but will be back nonetheless."}
{"text":"Wow! Prepare to eat at KFC afterwards if you plan on coming here. After wanting to come here for months, I've never been so disappointed at a restaurant.

The Turf Boodle Feast was a complete joke for 16 people. I don't know if it's because they've never served this many people for one table, but the amount of food was nowhere close to what the other pictures show. For $16 (tax and mandatory tip included), we each got: tons of rice, one small delicious drumstick (chicken BBQ), half of a spring roll, some small pieces of pork belly, 2 slices of some really good beef bistek, soup, half of an egg, one tomato chunk, a couple of green vegetables, and maybe a crispy pata because there weren't enough for everyone. For those of us who were \"lucky\" to have a crispy pata, it was a giant bone with very little rock solid meat which was inedible.

The only bright side were the drumstick and bistek as they had tender meat with excellent marinade.

None of us were full as we went for fast food afterward since Mama Nita's went ridiculously cheap on meat for our table. What's strange is that there was so much rice but in all other Yelp pictures, the rice was completely covered with meat. What happened?"}
{"text":"We did a family dinner here. Everyone had a great time because we had to eat with our hands. The parents loved that they could take pictures of a new dining experience. Everyone enjoyed the meal and said they would come back. Don't forget to add the pork skin. We were seated when they brought the food to the table.  Another table actually waited by the front so the server could place the food before they sat (we would probably do that next time - it seemed much easier for the server)."}
{"text":"It's a rare feat to get me to go for Filipino food in a restaurant, especially when you really love your mom's and aunt's home cooking, but when you get to eat with your hands right off banana leaves, you really raise the fun factor.

This was family dinner for us one Sunday after seeing that a few of our relatives have visited this establishment and really liked it. We ordered we ordered the feast for 10. It came with sinigang (tamarind based soup broth) as the starter. As the set up the table with the banana leaves on the table, amounts of rice was placed down the middle of the table. It was served with BBQ chicken, fried eggplant, beefsteak with onions, fried tilapia, fried eggplant, lechon kawali (fried roasted pork), and sisig (chopped meat dressed with vinegar). I do have to say that as they ran out of two of the items for our meal, the lechon and sisig were the substitutions. We also added fried bangus (milkfish) to the meal. If I wasn't so excited and hungry at the same time, I would have snapped a photo before we dug in. The food was delicious and you could tell by how little we were actually talking. I probably over ate but when it's good, it's hard to stop! Bring your family and friends and try a taste of the Philippines!"}
