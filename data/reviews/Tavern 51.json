{"text":"Amazing food all around. The steak sandwich is scary good; burgers as fresh as you can get. Steaks and salmon? OMG what a meal. You gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great and relax!!! The bartender \"Ji\" was very down to earth and friendly!!!  Overall good service, I will visit again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and what a value!  My wife and I stopped by after a local community meeting at the Whitehall municipal building.  In true Yinzer fashion we ordered pierogies as our appetizer.  They are sauteed in butter and delicious.  My wife ordered the steak sandwich and was pleasantly suprised by how tender the meat was because it was a flat iron style, not shredded like a Philly Cheese Steak.  I ordered the orzo pasta in a homemade chicken broth and it was excellent.  This chef has taken comfort food to the next level!

Contrary to some reports, Tavern 51 accepts credit cards (Visa or Mastercard) now.  This is quite a find.  My wife and I ate for under $50 including tip and two glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. The best steak hoagie I've ever had to the fish and flat iron steak. For a special treat ask for the chicken diablo (not on the menu). Road rage burger is awesome and the rare appearance of the Pot Roast special is to die for. Karen's margarita is the fabulous."}
{"text":"The storefront is unassuming  Walked in.   It is clean.   \"mom\" runs the bar.  She quickly serves me a yuengling black and tan.   It is quiet but big enough to accommodate a rowdy Steelers crowd.   I order a bacon wrapped pretzel.  The man next to me receives three bags of food and finishes his glass of Chardonnay. There is a menu for martinis, and a rack of domestic beer like Pittsburgh's own Red Eye and The Duke.   Other local lites are available.  No Stella, but you can get Spaten.   It's a Steelers bar with top shelf vodka.   Bacon wrapped anything is awesome.   Can't wait."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  Came here based on fellow yelpers in our new town and enjoyed the food and the wait staff.  Great pot stickers, steak sandwich, home made chips, & skillet steak.  Draft beer selection is limited."}
{"text":"There hasn't been anything that I've ordered here that I haven't loved.   From the buffalo bites appetizer to the steak sandwich or daily specials, everything that been amazing!  A little noisy at times but worth the visit if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count and I have NEVER been disappointed with their food. Yes, I agree, Chinese food at a dive bar seems a little wacky. However, this is hands down some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. Not only that, but they've got incredibly priced and deliciously prepared chicken wings. Tons of drink specials, fun atmosphere. DJs several nights during the week. Such a fun place with food that never disappoints!"}
{"text":"In town for the US Open - stopped in with my father and son for a few hours, we some had a beers and sampled a variety of dishes from the menu.  Beer was cold and crisp and wine was very good.   We started with Buffalo chicken breast and flatbread apps followed by filet tip special and ravioli and finished with funnel cake fries.  We recommend them all."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday around 8:00 and it was dead. There were 3 people at the bar and that was it. Anyway, I sat down with my wife and she ordered wings and fried pickles and I ordered a hamburger. The fried pickles came out first and they were pretty good. They were pickle spears and not the pickle chips. Still pretty good. The wings were pretty good. She ordered 8 with a dry rub and 7 mild. The hamburger was not very good. It tasted like a frozen burger. Only ate half of it. The girl tending bar was very nice and attentive. She gets an A+. My suggestion for this place is go for the drinks and wings. Stay away from the burgers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  Saw good reviews on Yelp.  Excellent burger, cooked exactly as ordered, the chicken breast on the Tavern chicken salad was juicy and tasty, and the homemade chips were delicious!  Had a Blue Moon ale and a coke.  The bartender/server was attentive.  Cost for all food and drinks was $25!.  Only complaint was that it was freezing in there.  The air conditioning was in turbo drive.  Even my husband was cold, and he's never cold. We'll return, but with heavier sweaters!"}
{"text":"Well the food is good but its real ghetto like with a fake Mariah  Lynn wanna be as the bartender and waitress, I wasent expecting that. Anywho, doesn't matter how good the food is, it's NOT worth my life.. So with that being said, I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"What a RUDE bartender and Asian owner. Amazing that these jerks attract anyopne at all. Went in for a cold brew around 5pm, took about 2 minutes before the \"lady\" behind the bar even acknowledged me. Her convo with the drunk at the other side of the bar must have been just too gripping for her. The owner came out from the kitchen and yelled something at her (could not understand what he said), and she rolled her eyes and went back to the kitchen for a moment. One lousy beer and I left. I saw four people in there, half-baked already. Kind of sad."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop in for a quick bite and were very pleased with our meal.  Unless there is a back room that I didn't notice, this is a small place, with only 6 or so tables and a bar, but the food was very good.  My wife had a burger and I had a steak sandwich.  Each was cooked to order and came with a side of house-made chips.  I was pleased that the steak was actual steak and not processed minute steaks.  They do accept credit cards and the staff was very friendly.  It is a good neighborhood tavern and we will be back."}
{"text":"Seriously, this is the last place in Charlotte or pretty much in the world you would want to to visit. It's been moved three times. I've heard of brutal fights and shootings.

Then and friend and I visited this bar the other night and I got one word. GHETTO. Sorry if this sounds racist but I think was with a black friend with a gun and even he was nervous!

Not much else to say"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this little place. It's the kind of place you'd drive right past if you didn't know any better. It didn't look like much from the road, and inside, it looks like your typical local bar. But whoever they have working back in the kitchen knows what they're doing. We ordered potstickers, a steak sandwich and a burger. The potstickers were pretty standard. The steak sandwich and burger? Outstanding. The meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The fresh chips were pretty fantastic, too. 
Don't drive past like we had done 100 times before. Go in and try the food. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am so happy we live close enough to have dinner here at least once a week.  Tom the chef is hands down the best cook in Pittsburgh. They have different specials every night. My favorite is the flat iron steak with mixed vegetables. Omg! The steak is so tender and tasty. The steak sandwich is so good and made to order. I like to call this place the \" Cheers\" of Pittsburgh. Karen, Renee and Sam always know your name and they are sure glad you came."}
{"text":"Easy to give this place a high rating, food, service and price was excellent!  If I lived in Pittsburgh I would be a regular. Loved the family atmosphere  ."}
{"text":"Today my wife and I paid our first visit.to Blvd Asian Kitchen at 8235 La Mesa Blvd, La Mesa CA.  We decided to try four different items from the Small Plates menue. We ordered Green Papaya Salad (all veggies crisp with a tasty Dragon Claw sauce), Warm Miso corn, (the corn is fresh from the cob), Chicken Wings (seven in all, with a sweet and spicy sauce), and the brisket Bao Bun Tacos (fantastic with their veggie garnish).  All excellent and complimented by the Saporo on tap. I strongly recommend Blvd and we will be back soon.  Oh yes, the service is top notch with the most friendly staff. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem on a recent \"marketing adventure\" for my trivia company.  It is absolutely everything a \"dive bar\" should be!  Great bar tender with a fabulously inappropriate  t-shirt (I've got your $5 foot-long with an arrow pointing down...) love it! Their were great smells coming from the kitchen but I didn't have time for a bite this time.... and a collection of regulars you might expect to see on a Sit-Com about a bar. Cheap beer -- good pours  -- and lots of laughs -- all this in the middle of the afternoon -- I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had so much fun at Tavern 51!  The drinks prices were very reasonable.  The bartender was fun and attentive.  They have a great patio out back.  The decor is nice and the place could not be cleaner!"}
{"text":"We were driving south on 51 and decided to get a bite to eat, as we had a ways to drive to get home..The 1st sign I saw that I liked, was that the parking lot had many cars in it. Once inside we were greeted by Rene, who asked if it was our 1st time here, as they know all the regulars here, and there were many that night... We got seated and ourlooked at our  menus and I'd say the cuisine is bar food,which is always a good thing. There appeared to be a nice variety of dinners one could order, but we kept it simple and went for sandwiches...At Rene's suggestion, I tried the Reubin and my wife got a veggie wrap..Both came with dry rubbed chips (a 1st for us) and these were to die for. As we watched Rene and another lady who was working interact with the others there, we know this place thrives on repeat business and they sure deserve it..Although we live too far from here to be regulars, we WILL stop here on our drives up to Pittsburgh..Heck, the dry rubbed chips alone are worth stopping for, never mind the whole rest of the meal..."}
{"text":"Got to tell you all, the food here is really very good. Had the pork chop special made with asiago, all I can say is wow!!!
Met the owners, Karen and her chef husband Tom - very nice people with a knack of making people happy.
The atmosphere here is much like a neighborhood bar, although it is very neat and clean and not the usual noise inside.
I'll be back and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place this evening based on Yelp reviews. My boyfriend and I don't drink but wanted to try the food. My boyfriend said his flank steak was as tender as filet mignon and he's a chef so he would know. He said he'd rate the flank steak dinner with roasted potatoes a 10!!!! My Italian hoagie was very good. The homemade potato chips were excellent.  Oh and our chicken pot stickers appetizer was yummy. Nice atmosphere. Seems like lots of regulars, everyone friendly! You must try it!"}
{"text":"The reviews are crap however the service was great and I am very picky the bartender was on point are you  looking for a place in the area???  or just bc come???
Ck them out ....wait now the ppl at Heffs and NC tavern are alll the same owner so beware bc I have spent well and tip well at both of them ratchetville"}
{"text":"We took my pap pap here for Father's Day dinner. We had never been here before. The food was great. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to grab a drink on our way back uptown after a fun (but long) day at Carowinds.  This bar is located in a sparsely populated strip mall and half of their menu is Chinese food.  Kind of odd, but maybe it's delicious--I can't comment on the food because we just came to grab a drink. We sat at the bar and had a couple rounds, which were both reasonably priced and heavy on the pours.  The bartender was very nice even though we were obviously the only two patrons there who weren't regulars.  I also liked that they carry Ciroc.  I'll probably never go back since I don't live in the area, but it was a decent spot for a couple of drinks after a long day."}
{"text":"I have been to this bar once.  If I lived in the area I would go to this bar everytime I wanted to drink alcohol.  There is a very good, young, energetic crowd that hangs out there.  There was live music on the night I was there (Thursday).  Also, they have an everyday special of $1 Miller High Life and PBR bottles.  The waitstaff was very attentive to getting me drinks when I was running low.  You cannot go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"My parents suggested that my husband and I meet them here for dinner.  We were initially skeptical, but ended up really enjoying the food and atmosphere.  It's a great little place for a casual meal and to grab a few drinks.  The place isn't large or fancy but the food was very good and priced were very reasonable.  My husband had a BLT sandwich and wings and enjoyed them both.  My parents both got the chicken marsala and liked it.  I had the vegetable orzo with grilled chicken which is a great choice if you are looking for something a bit lighter.  They have special menu items each day of the week, too.  For dessert we shared pumpkin cheesecake which I immediately regretted agreeing to share because it was very good!   The food takes a little while to come out, but we were told it's because they make everything fresh."}
{"text":"So, I work on the radio and I drive EVERYWHERE from gig to gig. When I drive down Rt 51, I make it a point to leave myself \"enough time\" to stop & eat at Tavern 51. Want a steak hoagie that isn't steak em's? You're in luck, I ordered mine medium rare and it was! I went local the last time I was there and had perogies. They were exactly what I expected in Pittsburgh, great! The only reason they get 4 outta 5 is; although they list the kitchen hours as:

Mon. - Thu. 11:30am til 10:00pm
Friday 11:30am til 11:00pm
Saturday 4:00pm til 11:00pm

Twice I've arrived mid-afternoon and had to wait for the cook to arrive. 
PS. I think the cook & afternoon bartender may be husband & wife (maybe the owners), but that's speculation....

They NOW accept credit cards, but NOT Discover. 

Last, but not least in my book... They serve COKE! 
Jack & Diet Coke is a 1000 times better than Jack & Diet Pepsi!

Nuff said!

{"text":"My brother Tim and his wife hand picked this restaurant for our family for a sad family reunion.   Being from the Northwest now where I may be a little more snippy in my reviews, my expectations of a restaurant with the front being a bar were not that high for the food. My spirits were down and dismal, but as family ordered drinks, I was able to order a Samuel Adams Octoberfest from tap to start off with. The waitress identified the chef had created appetizers \"on the house\" for us to enjoy before our meals arrived. We munched on specialty stuff (I will just say you gotta go there to find out) and then our meals arrived. My Dad had recommended the steak sandwich, but I opted for the \"special\" as my younger brother did, which was flank steak with roasted potatoes. When my meal arrived and I looked at it, first impression was to get a bottle of A1 Steak Sauce to smother it in. I thought best not to insult my family and the chef, so instead I took a small bite of the flank steak without anything else. The result- my mouth went into a savory overload!! I cannot recall in my life.. yes I said it, life of having so much perfect flavor from a flank steak. The steak had been no doubt marinated, sliced at a 45 degree angle with just the right amount of redness for a medium rare. The roasted potatoes- fabulous!! I had ordered sides of onions and peppers only to annoy my older sister for the ride home in her vehicle (Ya'll get the picture). 

Bottom line- excellent beer selection, great privacy for family functions and EXCELLENT STAFF and top honors to the Chef."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a bar person, but I really enjoyed it here. Didn't get a chance to try the food because I ate right before I got here, but it did look good. When my friend and I walked in, they were playing rock music, but when a couple more black people walked in, the music changed lol. I just had 2 shots of coconut ciroc and it was good! Completely divey, but I enjoyed myself. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Calamari and steamed shrimp AMAZING!!! Crab legs were overcooked so the meat didn't pop out like a washingtonian /MARYLANDER expects it to.  The crab legs were sent back but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Tavern 51 is a very warm neighborhood restaurnat and Bar. The Fish Sandwich is awesome  on Friday's  very large but very light.  I love the stuffed pretzel with cheese wrapped in bacon, Yummo! Another favorite is the rosetto poppers , so creamy and spicey, delicious!  My daughter really enjoyed the zuchinni parm on the app list, some of the very best she ever tasted .
The owners and staff  are very friendly and just good people to be around. So people if you get the chance give them a try."}
{"text":"Wife met some friends there & got me some take out because I was still working. Got the Italian hoagie. If you like burnt bread saturated with Italian dressing, this is right up your alley. Homemade potato chips were stale, & I'm still trying to figure out how they screwed up the pickle.

Glad they have a full service bar, because you'd have to be stone stinking drunk to eat there."}
{"text":"This might be a better place to go during the day because it is lit up like the sun.  I came a little later in the night after a long night of work and it was just a little to light and bubbly for me.  However, I will give it a decent review, because the bartender was a very happy girl with plenty of energy.  I may be a little biased, because I later found out that she is also an App Alumni like myself.  She danced, sang, and hopped around while taking everyone's orders.  Normally this would be distracting, but I think that it actually made the customers happier too.  With one dollar beer specials and gleeful employees, you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great cool place to hang out and have a great time! Great prices and food and wonderful nice staff bartender is awesome with fast and friendly service"}
{"text":"This place looks so ugly.It smells like very bad. The food items are not tasty.just for drinks and spending a while is OK"}
{"text":"Decent. Nothing to write home about good place for an appetizer and beer. However the main menu has an identity crisis (bar and grill is not fried rice or egg rolls maybe dumplings not so much). Sometimes small bar drama does not need to be shared with all."}
{"text":"Upon researching places that got good reviews in our neighborhood, my Bf and I read about this place.  We always wanted to give the steak a try per the reviews.  It was definitely worth the trip.  I ordered the steak special, as we went on a Saturday and my BF ordered a steak salad.  I don't know how they achieved making a flat iron steak so tender.  The veggies and potatoes on the side were sheer perfection too.  And OMG! If you order a salad please try the homemade balsamic dressing.  It was soooo good that I wanted to ask for some to take home.  

The food was great, but the waitress was so very pleasant to us.  She also told us to call for specials of the day, as sometimes they offer different things.  She just took her time to make us feel welcome and appreciated even though we weren't there for drinks.  This place is a must try!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on business travel for a late lunch/early dinner. Bartender was welcoming and honored their lunch special prices. Had a French Dip with chips... nothing extraordinary, but filling. Prices were fair and plenty of seating throughout."}
{"text":"The best steak I've ever eaten in my life! I recommend this to every resident and tourist that loves beef!

YUM!
'Nuf said."}
{"text":"I have never been in this area of Pittsburgh, but ended up in the neighborhood and saw Tavern 51 listed in Yelp with great reviews.  My date and I decided to roll the dice and give it a try.  Honestly, this was an exceptional meal!

The bar was neighborhood folks but VERY welcoming to us.  The decor is straight-forward/basic, but the food was awesome!  The pierogies were perfect... grandma-homemade good.  My date had the pepper-encrusted salmon and it was cooked perfectly!  She is a picky eater, and she LOVED it.  

...and the prices were incredible!

If you are looking for a great meal at a non-chain, friendly local place, I recommend you find your way to Tavern 51."}
{"text":"Small bar / eatery, family owned.  Cash only.  Really nice people.  Doing something different with their menu.  Had a flat iron steak special that looked good, but we honestly never made it past the appetizer menu.

Was going to get a steak sandwich which the people next to me at the bar were eating, but we ended up with the rice poppers - risotto with finely minced jalapeno then fried.  Even the ranch that it's served with works.  Cheesy, crispy, creamy goodness, hits all the right notes.  I think it demands pancetta or bacon, but then everything does.

The bacon wrapped pretzel log with cheese was just OK for me, but my brother liked it.  The mustard it was served with wasn't overpowering, which is often a problem.

Finally, stuffed banana (frying) peppers with tomato sauce.  A great ground beef with cheese another layer of gooey mozzarella and some parmesan on top, broiled and covered in a nice light tomato sauce.  Really excellent.

Sounds strange, but with the exception of the pretzel, reminded me of the kind of food I got in Rome at bars there.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around. This is a unique place. If you can get over the fact that some patrons are scummy this place is a gem. $2 coronas all day every day. A Chinese menu throwing in out of nowhere and a shot for just being their patron. Seriously go to this place with little expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Use to be a great little spot.  Not so much anymore.  No more $1 budlights."}
{"text":"Drove by this place many times and wish I had stopped in sooner. Steak sandwich was great. They use real meat!! Wings, Rueben, chicken tenders, and vegetable orzo were all on point. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and welcoming. Nice to know they do not have a microwave in their kitchen. Our experience far exceeded our expectation. We will be back."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague!    We sat for 15 minutes with out being waited on, while the only server took care of the bar patrons....waste of time."}
{"text":"I must say when I first went it was a place I could see myself hanging out at. However after tonight things changed for the worst. The owners are rude disrespectful and tasteless. The way I was treated tonight I will never enter this place again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars to hangout at! It's close to my house,  cheap but good drinks,  good food and the atmosphere is chill. Bartender is also really nice and is very attentive.  Great place to go chill after work or if you want a low-key Friday or Saturday night. Never too crowded."}
{"text":"Everything I have had at this establishment has been phenomenal!!  I've had the steak sandwich, wings, the home made chips, flat iron steak, tavern chicken salad, fries, and even the penne with marinara off the kids menu (my son couldn't finish it).  Everything I've tried is great!!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Had to give it a star to write a review but if I could have given it less I would have. Place sucks. You have to be a certain kind of person to have a good time here. Fights, uncomfortable stares, shitty food. If that's what you like, saddle up and get there. Who has two thumbs and won't go back? This guy."}
{"text":"Note 1: CASH ONLY. You'll see an ATM as you walk in. 

Note 2: Their kitchen closes an hour to an hour and a half prior to the listed closing time. 

On Friday evening (the 10th), I found myself with some money (payday!) and in the car of my girlfriend who picked me up from work and reluctantly agreed to eat here before she whisked me away to her place wayyyy out in the boonies. Yes, I was kidnapped, willingly

This unassuming place (it looks like a renovated home and have no idea how long its been here as it took a while for me to notice it), is as noisy as Kaib's in Mt. Washington! Man, the neighborhood locals (mostly people in their 40's-50's this trip) were feelin' good and loud on a Friday night. Big screen TV's showed college football games with people ooohing, ahhhing, and essentially whoopin' it up. 

Now, because it is somewhat rowdy, it may not be the kind of place you want to go to, but if you choose not to go, you'll possibly be missing out on some dandy food. 

Mostly serving typical bar fare (think burgers, sandwiches, wings, etc.) Tavern 51 also offers more upscale items such as Chicken Marsala, Vegetable Orzo, Pepper Encrusted Salmon, and Shrimp Scampi (!), all prepared by the mysterious Chef Tom. 

Eschewing the gourmet, Darren the Burger Slayer advanced his campaign.

Their 8oz. Black Angus Burger, served with the best homemade potato chips I've had to date, and a pale-on-the-inside, crunchy, cold dill pickle (which means it ruled) , was more than a match for my appetite. However, I felled the ground beefbeast like Tessaro's and Cheeburger Cheeburger's before. It's hearty, charred, and checks off all the boxes in terms of burger quality control. It was just what I needed to finish my week. Please, golf claps are in order for this fine specimen of burgerdom. You won't be left wanting. 

I tasted my date's BBQ Salmon Salad and began to regret my life's vocation as hunter and killer of burgers because it was that tasty. The salmon might as well have been ice cream, because you guessed it, it melted in my mouth (how many ways can you say it?).  The viniagrette it was dressed with took me to Heaven faster than a...

Whoa! Let's keep it PG. 

How could I forget our pre-meal munchie? They call it the Cheesy Bacon Pretzel Stick, which is a phat Sahs Syde-style doughrod that is stuffed with cheddar cheese and bound in bacon. Horseradish mustard is supplied for dipping, but this newfangled thing really didn't need it. They split it in two for us. Awww. Or as Pittsburgh girls say, \"Oooohawwww.\" Ya gotta hear 'em say it. 

We also shared a slice of apple pie, which they get from Signature Desserts in Castle Shannon according to the waitress. That's usually their only dessert offering, but we were told that they sometimes have homemade cheesecake on their menu. 

More than decent food + good service (from the excellent Renee)=A place you need to keep an eye out for if you're ever on Clairton Blvd. The menu keeps it from being just another dive bar. Raise a pint for Chef Tom, whoever he is."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the South Hills! Nothing fancy here. Just great fresh food! I come at least once a week and felt compelled to share .. flat iron steak.. not on the menu.. to die for.. otherwise can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Chef is the best hidden south hills secret."}
{"text":"The owner is the hardest working man in town.  For a small place he keeps a good beer selection between bottles and tap and the place was clean.  Steady crowd, excellent food."}
{"text":"I was at an all day track event at Baldwin High School and found this little gem on yelp! Karen behind the bar was attentive and very funny all while being real. The wings were cooked to perfection and the sauce was very respectable (Buffalo extra hot). I got their signature salad on Karen's recommendation with lemon vinaigrette, home run! Fresh potatoes, cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes and grilled chicken and plenty of it. If I am back this way I will stop by again!"}
{"text":"Not sure what to say, other than I'll be stopping by this place whenever in the area. Actually it is worth driving 45minutes. I love this place. Friendly locals. Food was fantastic, fish sandwich and steak sandwich were delicious. I hear the fish is fresh and prepared that day. So worth checking it out and becoming a return customer!"}
{"text":"We came on the 4th of July and it was a Ghost town.  Literally.  No one in sight except the bartender and yet he somehow seemed overwhelmed.  It was odd.  Anyway, we had a group of 6 and he encouraged us to try the chinese food on the menu because he has a \"chinese chef.\"  Odd stuff bro.  

Anyway, we all played it safe with either wraps or chicken wings.  Everything was not as bad as we were expecting considering their was chinese food, wings, salads, chips and salsa and fried pickles all on the same menu.  

The prices were decent but I am not desperate to return.  It seems like it would be a decent place to hang out if you are local, in the area and looking for a very laid back place to play a game of pool or grab a beer.  We ended up here because DD Peckers was closed but I can see the benefits of this \"dive.\""}
{"text":"A must anytime we're in Charlotte! Relaxed atmosphere with great drinks and unreal food to be a sports bar! I'm always impressed... The bartender is awesome and the wings, shrimp and crabs are delicious! Chill and eat here... You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Place has been here for a while and I've tried it a couple of times just to be fair. Personally when I walk into a bar I want bar food not Chinese/Asian cuisine."}
