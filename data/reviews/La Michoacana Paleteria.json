{"text":"Amazing! Sought this place out after reading the review in the Charlotte Observer. In brief, it's a humble store environment with super friendly staff and really great ice-cream and\"paletas\" or  popsicles They encourage you to try different flavors so you can appreciate the uniqueness of their products. You can get the traditional vanilla or oreo ice cream, but you need to try the cajeta (caramel), the mamey (OMG!) or my favorite was the pi√±on (a pine nut ice cream). Shout out to Javier who was so incredibly nice to my grandmother and encouraged her \"not\" to get the vanilla.......she loved the mamey!"}
{"text":"Fresh ice cream! The mango and strawberry was delicious... But don't eat at the torilleria next door. Are the tamales and have been sick all day"}
{"text":"My husband and i love this place. It's truly amazing their mangoniadas are the best and i have had there all natural mango ice-cream. It taste like you just bit into a real mango. We love coming here on a shot summer day. Defiantly recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"We've been looking for good mango con chili since we moved to the area. We got the mango con chili palletas.  A little heavy on the chili so the mango was way over powered.  Also got the sandia(watermelon) palleta and the blue marshmallow ice cream.  All was ok, but not blown away.  It was pretty pricey for what it was. It's a bit of a drive for us to get here so it's doubtful we will make a special trip to come back here."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Just go and enjoy the creamiest ice cream and Popsicles you have ever had."}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican style ice cream and more

It's like a little Mexico love this place recommend it very friendly staff also."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place needs more attention. If you're looking for delicious, creamy ice cream, sorbet, or handmade popsicles you MUST try this place. It is not in the fanciest of places but it's most definitely worth going out of your way to visit. 
Driving up N Tryon we've seen this shopping center tons of times and have always said, \"hmm, we've gotta try that place sometime\".  Several years have passed and we finally went. I wish we would have gone sooner. 
Ok so enough about the lengthy reasons and excuses. On to the food....
We walked in to the faint smell of Clorox. Lol  I know, not appetizing but clean is on the top of my list when I think about places to consume things.  Notice I gave this place 5 stars... 
Ok so very clean and organized shop. Friendly staff greeted us in Spanish (luckily I speak fluent Spanish) but they speak perfect English too. 
They have a huge selection of pops, both dairy and dairy free. Then you move on to the ice cream section. Again, an even huger selection of fresh ice creams and sorbets of all sorts of typical and unique flavors. You will find spicy chili flavors and fruits you've never heard of or even knew existed. 
I'm from Miami and I often dream about my favorite fruit, Mamey. It's not a well known fruit in the rest of the US but to my surprise this place had fresh mamey ice cream!  What!?!?!  Dream come true!
I had not planned on having any ice cream that visit, as I was just going to get some for my family. Well, I ended up having a small cup of the mamey. It was heaven in a cup!
My hubby had the cajeta (dulce de leche/ cream salted caramel) and my child had bubble gum (duh). 
Exceptional ice cream!!!!!  A must try. And they allow you to sample the variety.  For those who are adventurous or like living dangerously, go ahead and try something you've never heard of. You just might like it. ;)"}
