{"text":"I read many good reviews so went today There were 3 dinners so we decided to share the large fish and chips and large pizza We were the only diners After 35 min one bowl of fish was delivered I had to ask for extra plates,silver and vinegar The fish was supposed to be served with cold slaw,when asked \"where is the slaw\" I was told 'I will make some' After 50 min,the pizza will be right out We decided enough was enough and asked for our check Would you like the pizza 'to go' No goodbye The friendly Italian owners were not to be seen"}
{"text":"I eat here once or twice a week. Everything on the menu is delicious. Sam and his family are very nice people and delivery is quick. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a little variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Super cute, local spot in the Scottsdale Airpark. I met a friend here who works close by and wouldn't stop talking about this place. It's kind of hard to find I drove right past it the first time. It has a very homey feel, it's super clean and the smells will make your tummy talk from the moment you walk in. They have quite a variety of food to choose from. I heard their fish and chips were awesome and I heard right. They were lightly battered and crispy without being greasy. The prices are very reasonable and the owners are very friendly and passionate about their business. The only thing I would alter about this place is some outdoor seating, they are located in a beautiful courtyard. I did hear they are looking into it.  Please go check it out and support this cute hidden local spot!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here multiple times. Everything is sensational!  Gyros and burger are my favorite. Burger will beat any fast food desire and its priced better too"}
{"text":"This is a nice little Italian (Greek) restaurant near the Airpark that serves really good food!  I had been going to Lunch N Go just down the block for years and found they had recently closed about five weeks ago.  Stuck, I decide to stop into The Italian Spoon instead.  Wow.  What a nice surprise and I had been driving past this place and didn't know they were there.  As I stated in my Tip, the Italian Spoon serves one of the best Gyros I've ever had outside of Astoria.  If you order it with a soft drink, it comes to a very reasonable $7.87.  Next time, I'll try the Philly Cheesesteak.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros In Town!!!!! Have had several gyros in the area, but none of them compare to theres.....Fried Zuchinni and Pizza are also delicious as well....Great experience eating in at the Spoon, and the staff is awesome, great friendly people..."}
{"text":"If I could give it a ZERO I would  So.. I tried to go to Lunch The Italian Spoon On Redfield and Hayden today and was promptly told By a kid in basketball shorts, flip flops and a tee shirt that we had to leave because they were too busy to take my order??? While there was one other couple in the entire place and was also told it because the cook called in sick. He told us we can come back some other time. Yup i'll be sure to go back,, HELL NO!! Pass this on and share it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, I have had the fish & chips and the gyro sandwich. Both very good. The owners are very friendly and are happy to see you when you come in."}
