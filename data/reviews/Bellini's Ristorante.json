{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in this city. Right from the time we stepped into the restaurant till we left, we were made to feel special. Great service and the food was perfect (i still dream about the fish and the lobster ravioli is plain heaven)  The decor could have done with a bit of freshening up but still quite nice. Definitely going back there."}
{"text":"This is another great Yorkville restaurant that isn't pricy, but has great food.  The menu isn't extensive, but almost everything we've had has been great (and good restaurants usually don't have extensive menus since that means wasted ingredients).  The decor is kind of stale, but since it's not pricy (especially for Yorkville), it's not a deal breaker.  The waiter looks like he has been there forever and is always super pleasant.  It is probably the only $20/meal place where they actually take your coat away."}
{"text":"Quite formal,excellent service and good quality of food. My only comment would be the variety of dishes available are not as extensive as other Italian restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"I came back after many many years and am delighted by this gem.   The waiter was super attentive and very helpful.  We ordered a bottle of the lovely house Chianti.  We split the tomato and mozerlla salad and they split it for us.  We shared the lamb shank, which was out of this world and the spinach gnocchi.  It was delicious and I needed to be carried out. No room to try their dessert ..."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in Yorkville. I made last minute reservations and was happy to be greeted warmly when I arrived. Service was prompt and professional. The food was well prepared and, combined with a good price and decent portion size, a great value. The only drawback is the slightly lower than street level location in a neighborhood of outdoor and roof top patios. Still, I'd return given the opportunity."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I came here a few weeks ago. We made reservations, however when we got there, our table was not ready. We were seated in a very awkward spot at the back of the restaurant while we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. When we got our table, we literally waited a half hour before someone came to attend to us. My boyfriend actually had to get out of his seat and track a waiter down to come and see us. After letting someone know we were STILL waiting, we waited another 10 minutes before they were able to see us. Not to mention the waiter was not very apologetic about the situation. The food was okay. Not spectacular, although I'm sure I would have found it in me to appreciate it more had the experience been better. I understand all restaurants have good and bad moments - but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. The service was something I would expect to happen at a cheap franchise, not upscale place.  I will never go back"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! Service is fantastic, very cozy."}
{"text":"Using one of those Dealfind voucher can be a challenge.... you got to do everything right if not basically they said NO ... can't do....   When booking a reservation make sure you it is 24 hours in advance, tell them you are using your voucher, give them the voucher number and make sure you give the voucher to the waiter before you order. If not, you maybe scolded.....   Bellini's Ristorante is in Yorkville, so I do expect everything at a higher price point. The cocktail list for sure reflected that $16 for any of those on the list... We ordered the Bellini and Mojito which were not well balanced and definitely not worth their price tag.   Appetizers:  Vine Ripened Tomato & Buffalo Mozzarella ($12)  Crab and Avocado Tower ($13)   Pasta:  Spaghetti Bolognese ($17)  Truffle Risotto ($17)   Dessert  Molten Chocolate Cake ($10)   How's the food? Not bad.... but I didn't WOW me for sure. The Molten Chocolate Cake was not warm... not even lukewarm....   Services was excellent though! Attentive and professional. Our wet trench coats were coat checked by our hostess which was a nice touch.   Decor is classy and kind of romantic with the dim lighting.   I don't think I will be back if I don't have another voucher. But for sure I am going to skip the cocktails......"}
{"text":"Booked a lonely table for one on Opentable.  Dark dinning room a few steps down from the drag. Older crowd on a Wednesday night at 9 (50-80) with a couple of hipsters filling in the gaps but not dressy as others have mentioned. Smart casual will work nicely and I did see a young couple walk in around 9:30 in flip flops.  Cool and candle lit with Frank playing non stop. How cliche'.  3 choices for red by the glass. Boo. Chose the chianti and it was fine.  Hearts of Romaine but no anchovies available. Very nice Caesar over fresh greens served quickly.   Osso Bucco is always as the top of my list to test a new ristorante next to a bolognese. Tonight calls for the bone. Now if I could change the CD. How about some Andrea Bocelli to \"spice\" it up?  The bone came and it was big. Huge portion actually. This is best split between two it's so big. Tender?  You can eat it with a spoon. There is a god! Frank is out and oh no, Dean Martin. Well, that's amore. Sharp eye refilling my wine from the crafe and once after saying \"thank you\", the reply was \"you're welcome Mr. Bla bla bla\". Very cool to pull that from my reservation. Nice touch.  No room for Jello but I'll look at the dessert menu. Mostly for the after dinner drinks. B I N G O. Vin Santo but for $20, that's a stretch. If they have biscotti I'll spurge. Yippee.   All and all them evening was great. I was treated very well as a single and the food was superb. I'm not discounting for the music and Bellin's could well be a 5 star joint. This being my first visit, they rate a 4 with potential.   Im stuffed as I hear \"Your nobody until somebody loves you\". I could not agree more but the same goes for a restaurant. Well Bellini's, I love you...but please mix up the music."}
