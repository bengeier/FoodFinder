{"text":"comfortable, great music, great food.
First visit a couple of weeks ago, took a friend for her birthday dinner.  Two drinks, 2 steak dinners with coffee, around 70.00.
I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went several times here since i live across the street and I gotta say the beer deals / nachos are the best in this side of town!  The meals are great too. But a little pricey and sometimes on the small side. Unless your a girl and like to eat light when going out better stick to the nachos."}
{"text":"I'd give it five if they showed boxing other than that great selection of beers and the owner and staff make it! Good Irish atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Love the pub atmosphere. Friendly, helpful staff. Menu is far above avg pub food, chicken mushroom pie had great red wine favouring. Definitely will be a regular to try the my 2nd,  3rd & 4th choices from menu. Finally a place worth  coming to here."}
{"text":"The best pub in our area without a doubt.  Food is consistently good (especially the Sunday night roast.
Lunch specials are the best and the lunchtime service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Love this pub.  It is our favourite place to go when we don't know where to go.  The food is terrific.  The menu changes from time to time, so the selection never gets stale.  The wait staff is great, too!  We've been for lunch, dinner and brunch.  And you should see how they party on St. Patricks Day!  

Odd location, but when people realize there is full parking behind the pub (with a back entrance), it won't seem too odd. And, such clean bathrooms.  Thank G@d."}
{"text":"Great people and excellent food!! Always feel so welcomed!! Food is beyond any typical pub food! Recommend the weekend specials!! Overall a great place to dine with family and friends!!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous place this is.  The owner  and the staff are always attentive. The food is first rate.  My son and his hockey team LOVE the chicken fingers.  My daughters absolutely love the poutine, My husband the Gate burger..and me it is a tie between the Guiness Mussels and the Chicken and Blue Cheese Salad. Paddy and wife Martha along with the wonderful staff have made St. Jame's Gate a neighbourhood favorite with our family.  Thanks and CHEERS to Etobicoke for being blessed with this  fine establishment."}
{"text":"KWent here on a Saturday night. It was nice inside but my first impression was TERRIBLE because there was live music and it was so loud that the floor was vibrating. I honestly wanted to walk out because loud music is a huge pet peeve of mine. Not to mention the poor servers - this is a workplace hazard. There was nowhere in the whole place that was free from the music. I really hope that management deals with this.

That said, I'm told they only have the live music on Saturdays, and after a pint I was feeling much better about the situation. 

I got a burger the size of my head, which was delicious. Fries were great too.

I also really like that they have daily drink specials, which made choosing a beer much easier.

All in all a good experience. It's nice to find a bit of Irish out in the wilds of Etobicoke. I would go back, just not on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to pub for after work chill time but mainly because it's across the street from my apartment.  My husband and I have been here many times and always find the food quality to be satisfactory, yet maybe a bit too pricey for what you get.  Most of the dishes are fine yet I would recommend against getting the burger sliders.  We ordered them once and they came burnt so we asked for them to be done again.  They came back burnt again lol!  So we just gave up.  We ordered them on another occasion and they didn't seem burnt but they still didn't taste good.  We finally learned our lesson and just stopped ordering them.  

Besides that it's a large pub which means there's usually always a seat,  and they are all booths!  The service is excellent,  it didn't take them long to begin recognizing my husband and I and it's nice to have that familiarity.  The crowd is usually good too,  nice people,  nice atmosphere.  I would go for the beer and for snacks,  not so much for the entr√©es,  if that helps."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pubs! Beautiful wooden bar and booths, the atmosphere is warm and classy. The pub fair is great, burgers are delicious, Gluten free options are available. The staff is friendly and accommodating. If you're coming to watch the game, that's what you'll get, TV screens are in plain sight and even a large projector, the sound is off - thank goodness - keeps the noise at a manageable level ;) You'll find this a family friendly pub, especially for weekend brunch. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pub I've ever been too! I've been coming here with all of my friends for over a year now and it is honestly my favourite spot in the city!

The staff are incredible, the food is amazing, and the musical acts are wonderful!

Could not recommend this place more!!

Billi, Alexa, Vicky, Ru, and Elaine...the best people you'd ever meet!!

Also, try the Guinness and the Guinness BBQ wings!"}
{"text":"Nothing negative....oh well besides the moron customers blocking you in at the rear parking....there is nothing negative to say about this pub.
I've been there for dinner twice in the last month for good reason. The smart menu and great beer.
There's a special deal per day, (e.g. 1/2 price appetizers) and Leffe on tap for the hubby. We enjoyed the chicken pie & the brie app is so worth repeating....mmm i cant wait until next time.
Atmosphere is loud and rich Irish pub. Better than the avg pub fare, it seems like the menu was very well thought through. Great choices, duck topped poutine, spicy jambalaya, sweet potato Sheppard's pie with beef & lamb.  No frozen foods here!"}
{"text":"Good food, music and service! Very comfortable pub to have some dinner and drinks at."}
{"text":"This is an excellent establishment. We came here with our baby daughter on a Sunday afternoon and it was a great experience. We parked in front of the pub and parking was also available at the back. They had an ample menu and the food was good (veggie burger with goat cheese and sweet potato fries was delicious) and beer was reasonably priced (any Irish pint was $6). The service was fantastic as the wait staff and manager were friendly and accommodating. They have plenty of seating space so we were not cramped in. They even had a great Irish band with an audience that was free to perform traditional Irish dance. And they did! They do this every first Sunday of the month. My daughter loved it.  A great spot!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, nice setting and location.

We tried the Chimichurry Salmon and the Chicken Curry, both of which were decent.

Another reviewer said they have Hoegaarden which they do not, at least not any more. They have Shock Top though which is Belgian blonde ale and while not as good, is okay.

Would like to try the brunch menu soon."}
{"text":"St. James Gate has good food, a friendly atmosphere and I love the big peppermint Lifesavers they give out with the bill. That said service, which is the #2 element of a restaurant that makes it a place to come back to, is often bad. There's a server named Billie and if she's working (weekdays but not Tuesday) the service is second to none - she knows how to read a table and check people's faces to see if they're looking for something. 

Yesterday (Dec. 10) we were there at lunch and were entertaining some friends - the service and the food were slow. Trying even to get the managers' eye was impossible -in fact he and other servers would walk by looking totally the other direction. Now I will say the Manager came over to ask if everything was okay at the end but with guests there we didn't want to get into it. AND it wasn't the first time we've had that kind of poor service there - it's only when Billie is working that we are truly happy - she should be training the others.

Again - the restaurant has good food, and it has entertainment many weekend nights so if they can pick up the service on a consistent basis they'll get more of our business."}
{"text":"I'm picky about food and I'll eat here. 

Food is good. Good beer selection. The service isn't crazy good... But they do have a very sound hiring practice. 

It's always busy. If your dropping in for a beer you might not get a seat at the bar. 

They often have live music..... Always a great time."}
{"text":"The new owner's have REALLY changed this place up from when it used to be Miller's tavern.  

The layout is very authentic for an irish pub, with open spaces (great for watching the match on telly,) little nooks and crannies for more intimate meetings, and a great room for private functions.  

Beer and scotch selection are highlights, but the winelist wasn't barren either.  

Menu food is great, but try the specials!"}
{"text":"We moved in right across the street from this place and decided to finally try it out.

Upon entering there was no signage indicating whether to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. After a few moments of looking lost, we were seated at a table next to the window.

They have a decent selection of tap and bottled drinks, as well as many shooters and cocktails. My girlfriend ordered the Hunters Pie with a Magners cider; I ordered the Sheppards Pie with a pint of Stella.

It seemed to take a while for the food to arrive, and it wasn't very busy. Perhaps a slow day? New chef?

When the food arrived it was piping hot and oh so tasty. Very delicious. My girlfriend had no complaints about hers.

As usual, they accept credit cards and cash only, but they have an ATM by the washroom: $2.00 fee.

Since we live so close, we walked over, which was a good thing as there are about eight parking spots. Being in Etobicoke, on a busy street, you would think there'd be more.

The washroom was very clean, and well stocked.

I would easily recommend this place to anyone looking for a night out."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great beer selection. This place is definitely popular and the noise levels from both the amount of people plus the music playing in the background make it difficult to carry on a conversation (hence 4 stars instead of 5). A must go if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Neighbourhood haunt that is friendly with cold beer, lots of whisky and delicious food."}
{"text":"Great food, great scotch and Irish whiskey list, good service and lots of cold beer.
St James gate is a welcome addition to Etobicoke
Definitely my fave Irish pub in the west end
Burgers are phenomenal, get the gate burger!

Lots of big screens too!"}
{"text":"It's a very big, comfy pub (although a bit generic looking). I had the fish and chips and they were fantastic. The service was pretty slow, but when I went it was a special event night, so I don't hold it against them.

I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"Really delicious good old comfort food. I moved in across the street and will now be a regular, so much more I'd like to try! So far I've tried the fried calamari, which is lightly breaded to just the right amount of crispiness, and the Dagwood sandwich. The sandwich is huge (I saved half for lunch the next day) and is very tasty. The pickles are particularly great. The fries are good here too. My second trip here I had the big Irish fry for brunch. It's the perfect amount of everything you'd want in a big breakfast, lots of eggs and sausage/bacon proteins, some sweet baked beans, a satisfying but not in-your-face amount of homefries, and really good multi grain bread. No peanut butter though, they should get that. Oh and brunch comes with a free little cornbread muffin, which was nice too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My two favourites at this Gaelic pub is the stew and the lobster & macaroni. The service is courteous and entertainment on weekends is sizzling."}
{"text":"Used to go regularly because the wings are great. They still are and the suicide ones are delish! Tonight we ordered a pitcher of the goose island because we saw it on draught. We were just told that they don't have it with no further explanation (but we saw the tap?) So I ordered the Reuben sandwich and it was sooo sooo super unbelievably salty. It might have been the mustard. I couldn't finish it and when I told the server she basically didn't react. Cool beans. If you go, just don't get the Reuben."}
{"text":"Great food great staff great atmosphere.  Special events are amazing. Just wish you guys had some more craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my husband and I have been to this bar a handful of times since we live in the area. The first time we went was what kept us coming back; food was absolutely great and our waitress was freaking phenomenal.

Last night... not so much. It started out okay - waitress was friendly, our drinks came quickly... and then it was all downhill from there. Our food took over an hour to come without the waitress coming by to explain or refill our drinks even ONCE (meanwhile she was wrapping up cutlery, locking up the chairs/tables outside, walking by us - and our empty drinks - 100 times). So finally, after about an hour and 15 minutes of no food and no drinks, we decided to get up, toss her $20 to cover our drinks and leave. That's when our food came with just a \"oh my god, I'm so sorry! This has never happened to me before!\". The food was COLD - I mean, I got a lobster poutine (which would've been amazing if it was hot) and it was 100% cold through and through (do you know how long it takes a poutine to get cold like that?! How long was our food sitting there?!)

Either way... we were starving so we choked back our food at which time a DIFFERENT waitress came to apologize (I guess our initial waitress didn't have the balls to come back to our table??). She was VERY nice and gave us a $30 gift card saying \"I apologize, I'm sure your waitress told you what had happened\" - nope! Had she come by even to explain what was going on an refill our drinks, my husband and I would've been understanding and at least bought another caeser (they make kick ass caesars there!) and another glass of wine. And we would've come back because, at the end of the day, it happens. 

Ended up editing this review because I was a little harsh at first. All in all, it's a great bar and most of the waitresses are awesome... Won't be coming back though."}
{"text":"The Mr and I love this place to stop in for a beer and a bite on any given day of the week. 

Always greeted and seated quickly by super friendly staff, and while  the weather is still great, we thoroughly enjoy sitting on the cozy, well lit patio during our evening visits. 

Decent food menu and a nice selection of rotating craft beers. 

Weekend live entertainment has been quite impressive and has always kept us well entertained. 

Limited parking out front but plenty behind the building. 

A place worth while checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Menu is always having tweaks and the specials are out of this world. Unique combinations/infusions.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I hadn't been inside of this building since maybe 20 years.  It used to be Miller's country fare and it's a large footprint for a pub to be cozy so it's a large pub in different rooms.  This format sort of reminds me of the way Mamma Martino's is segmented into multiple \"phases\" because there's an original foot print and added absorbed other space if in fact that's what happened here.  

It's not an open space and it fees like this place is in pieces put together.  It does make for some privacy and the decor is pretty well done.  The place can be really packed it seems.  We were there on a Friday and the place seemed to be really full but not capacity.  There is a nice outdoor patio space but it's not large. The parking in front is limited to only 6 spaces I think.  I was lucky enough to get one.

We arrived around a quarter to 9.  On Friday there's a special of 2 Guinness pints for 12 bucks.  That's a special?  It's maybe save a  buck on each pint but if it's better than regular price I suppose. 

The service here seems pretty friendly.  I did however find myself looking around for our server from time to time.  I'd rather have to not look for our server but it was sort of a busy night it seemed.

To eat I had ordered a Hogtowner burger.  This burger is HIGHLIGHTED in red on their menu so since it's the feature burger I had to order it.  The description is as follows:

\"The Hogtowner = Half pound handcrafted burger topped with maple Tankhouse Ale soaked pork loin, aged cheddar, buttermilk fried crispy onion curls and horseradish aioli\"

Now as I did with my last 16 dollar burger I will have to measure this one against my last one.  The last 16 dollar burger I had was from Dymond's in Burlington.  Although this burger was really very good it wasn't as epic as Dymond's DSK burger.  The taste of the Hogtowner was good, the size was decent and the highlight of it was the horseradish aioli.  It gave such a nice and different flavor that went well with the pork loin and beef burger.  It was served on an Ace Bakery bun so I will give it that some of the best burgers I've had are served on an Ace.

Is this feature burger good? Absolutely but not the best 16 dollar burger I've had.  In this round, Dymond's DSK still takes the crown.

The overall ambiance of this place is very welcoming.  The staff is well trained and the the food I'd have to say is above average for pub food.  

I would have liked if our glasses weren't allowed to be empty for a long time and parking could be an issue considering that stretch of Dundas you can't park on the street.  I'm really not sure where one would park legally nearby if not in front."}
{"text":"we came here for late night.  we wanted to watch the raps game and we craved some pub food.  at first we were going to go to a wing place but when we called it was packed!  so we decided to try this place.  nice and close!  we came in and i don't think the raps game was playing on a big screen so we asked and they were so nice to change it to a huge screen.  they had a good selection of beers!  we then ordered some nachos...they were nice and crispy and cheesy!  we also got some wings...mmm!  juicy and flavourful!  it was a good, nice homey spot in etobicoke and we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, friendly staff, amazing fish and chips. The atmosphere is so cozy -- feels like our own \"Cheers\", even though we've only been a handful of times."}
{"text":"Great pub food and service!  We were so stuffed after dinner we had to be rolled out.  This restaurant is big and has the Irish pub feel.  There was no wait when I came here for dinner on a weeknight.  They also have daily specials like 2 for 1 wings on Monday and $10 burgers on Wednesday.

Mussels$12  - These mussels tasted fresh, comes with pita and is served in a red sauce.
Calamari $12 - Nicely breaded, good texture and yummy dipping sauce.
Cauliflower dip $11 - Comes with pretzel bites to dip in this sinfully delicious dip.  It's hard to tell there's cauliflower in it since it was so cheesy. 
Chicken Mahkhani $17 - Juicy tandoori chicken, well cooked basmati rice and nicely spiced sauce.

The private lot in front of the restaurant can accommodate about 8 cars, but there are extra spaces next door.

{"text":"I recently moved to the area na d it was the first time go here and for sure won't be the last. Everything was perfect and they have a very nice patio at the front. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is like \"Gourmet Pub Fare\", but at reasonable prices. I love the food here. Great place."}
{"text":"I really like this pub. Food's great, atmosphere's great and the beer selection is ok. Overall, this is an enjoyable pub."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend staying out near the airport, but refused to eat anything in that area so cruised back into Etobicoke to give this place a go, and happy we did!

The place was moderately busy on a Friday night but we were able to get a table near the bar. Decent import beer selection, although not much in the way of craft beer. I had the pulled pork sandwich and was very very impressed. Saucy and tasty as I like it, and good fries on the side. I'd dare even say this makes my list Top 5 pulled pork sandwiches in Toronto. My wife had grilled salmon and was impressed, and our guest ordered a burger with salad on the side and said good things. 
And while everything did seem fresh, I'm still docking a star because the food took a seriously long time to come out, and trying to get our servers attention for our bill took an addition stretch of unnecessary time afterwards.

I don't often come to Etobicoke, but if I do again, I'll very much consider a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Nice sized Resto Pub with tons of beers on tap, and oddball beers in the fridge (Hello Innis & Gunn). Bar area has a bunch of flat screens for the TV watchers, a lot of booths in the middle for the meal eaters, and even a room perfect for Private parties. 

They have live music on Thursdays and Saturdays, and a bunch of daily specials all week long. (I'll be back with my better half for the Complimentary Oysters on Friday from 5-7!) Tried the Shepard's Pie and it was excellent with my Guinness.

Glad to see something good at this location - I have fond memories of the old \"Miller's Country Fare\" and their Pioneer Bread. Mmmmemories of cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"Especially like the bar area and drink selections.. Mon and wed have food specials. The stew is good, 15 bucks. Burger also very good, pricey at 17 bucks.
Rolling rock is a great beer."}
{"text":"St. James's Gate has a good selection of food and beer for the area. It's one of the better restaurants right around Islington station. However, I feel as though the food isn't cooked on site, because it seemed like my pot pie had been frozen and then microwaved. 

On Fridays and Saturdays, there's generally live music. On some nights, a crowd that seems more fit for the Entertainment District than an Irish pub in the West end gathers there."}
{"text":"Wings and cold beer on NFL Sunday football. The wings are hot and the service is great and the price is resanable."}
{"text":"This is really such a lovely, not so little, pub reminiscent of proper UK pubs.   They even have chrisps hanging from the wall, although not Walkers brand :(

Regardless, if we lived closer this would 100% be our local.  It certainly appears to be the local for most others in the neighbourhood and deservedly so.  

Our barman, Anton, was fantastic.  Their food is a cut a over what one should expect from a pub and everything is made in house.   This includes their calamari - who breads their own calamari?  These guys!

Awesome place"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Patty is great and teaches his staff well. Very weird location but perfect for us since we live so close! Although I wish they would put the Brie app and spinach salad back on the menu."}
{"text":"We heard that they offer $4 caesars during weekend brunch so we decided to stop in.

We were immediately greeted by a super friendly waitress who seated us to one of the few booths that were available.  We ordered the caesars, which arrived quickly and were, surprisingly, really, really good!  I decided to go with the eggs benedict; my husband ordered a burger and fries and his son ordered wings and fries.  I hate to say this but it was a long wait before the food arrived.  It wasn't just our table either that were waiting a while.  When it finally came, everything was very good; however, my eggs benedict were cold ... the nice waitress offered to have them make me more but, honestly, I was so hungry at that point that I told her not to bother.  She did, nonetheless, pull it from our bill.

All in all, great atmosphere and it looks like they offer a lot of specials during the week.  We definitely plan to go back and, at that time, I will update this review.

Also, just to note, there is ample parking in the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here for the first time.  Really good home fries, eggs were the way we like them, and prompt friendly service.  We will be back...

This is our go-to place for homestyle meals.  My favorites are the pub fare - Irish Stew, Hunter Pie, Chicken Country Pie and Chicken Curry.  Never gone wrong with any of those.  

One day, we'll come for the live music!"}
{"text":"Aren't Irish pubs great?  And as far as good Irish pubs are great, this one is one of my favourites. 

The food is always well prepared and very tasty. The prices are decent so most entrees are 10-20$. The service is really great and all of the servers and bar staff are very good and have a terrific attitude. 

And here's another fun fact. They have beer!  Usually one or two are on special each night. Last night it was Kronenberg and Sommersby pints for $6.

Food wise, last night I had the Dublin burger (plain hamburger even though there is nothing plain about Dublin) with fries. It was quite satisfying. I have included a picture of how much I liked the Burger and fries. 

They have limited parking in front and out back or meters nearby.  And they have live music on weekends. 

Hope you get to enjoy the fun atmosphere at this great pub soon."}
{"text":"The homemade fries and the chicken sandwich were both phenomenal, worth every penny and filling. I will be back here to eat again. Albeit I'll try something else when I grab my second bite. Really tasty meal. Friendly staff to add."}
{"text":"I love the set up of this pub. And it's huge. The food has always been good and they do have rotating daily specials. My only concern is the wait staff. They appear to be trying to hard. Every time I have gone in there it has been slow (usually around late lunch/early dinner) so they stare at the stable (more than a few servers have done this.) My only major complaint is having to get them to fix my bill nearly every time I go there. 
They push the specials, so I order the specials and then get charged full price. Last time this happened, the waiter charged my credit card twice and I had to go through mastercard and the management to get the issue solved. That was a bit of a let down but I will probably be back, I'll just pay cash next time. 

They do not take debit vbut do have an overpriced ATM in the back that is available to use."}
{"text":"It may be in a weird location for a pub, but you'll be surprised once you get in-- nice spacious tables, fast and friendly service, and a generally older and polite crowd just enjoying a couple of drinks with friends or family. There are no noisy party-people here which for me, is great. Also, been having difficulty finding Hoegaarden in other bars, but St.James has it-- cheers to that! Was also very happy with my Guinness ribs. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This pub is located in a weird stretch of Dundas St. West and we passed by it a lot of times before finally giving it a try.

The parking lot is pretty tiny - a few spots in the front and in the back.  We ended up parking in a Green P lot close by as all spots were taken.

Interior is very generic pub, not unlike a Firkin, but very spacious.  We arrived on a Friday night and were instantly excited to discover that it was complimentary oysters night!  Grabbed some drinks - beer on tap wasn't too exciting.  Settled with pints of Kilkenny and Rolling Rock.

Food order was the Chicken Country Pie ($12.52) and the Gate Burger ($13.72).  We inquired about those complimentary oysters but were told by the waiter that they were not available on this night.  Boo-urns St. James's Gate.  

Both entrees came out quickly.  The chicken pie was piping hot and homey.  I thought the Gate Burger was pretty awesome - beef had a great grilled taste and it was juicy to boot.  Nicely done!

Service was friendly and efficient.  We'll probably be back but there better be oysters next time."}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's mothers surprise party. We had a private room and an assortment of appetizers flowing all night. Nachos, cheese board, calamari, wings, etc. I found that the nachos needed more toppings and the wings were the only stand out in my opinion. Cheese is always delicious so no complaints there. Our server for the night was amazing! Unfortunately I do not know her name. She was able the keep the bills divided, did not mess up our orders and everything arrived quickly. We thought the live band would be a top 40 cover band but it was actually a jazz band. I don't't know much about the target audience for a Irish pub but I wish the music was more lively. Her mother loved it though. My friend Sam will dance to anything and anyone who was there that night probably remembers her. I ordered the veghead Pierogies because I love veggies and I LOVE PIEROGIES! They were just ok, nothing memorable. The burgers looked really good and everyone who ordered one devoured it. Overall we had a great night and if I go back I will order some classic Irish pub food."}
{"text":"Amazing bar in the Etobicoke area if you're looking to just chill have some drinks and eat some really good food. Nachos, chicken curry and the Irish stew are the best things to get from the Irish pub."}
{"text":"First time here, came based on the reviews on yelp. Isn't that how we all decide now-a-days? We arrived about 8::15pm friday night, was seating, lots of people inside(birthday party too). ordered a pint of Stella, not too expensive like some places. We started off with the tacos....don't bother, same your $12.00. tiny piece of fish inside for $12 not worth it....we then ordered the royal cheese burger and i got the hog one (forget the name). Mine was super delicious and my bf agreed so was his. Had to take 3 bites around before getting to taste the patty. Really tasty, would get this one again. or try the royal cheese. We didn't get desert. The waitresses were really busy and nice.quick to take your plates away. They had live music come on at 9pm and it was so loud in there i couldnt here my bf talking who was sitting directly in front of me. Even though....they played great songs so evidently we didn't mind. but i'm sure some people would. I would come back if i'm feeling a lively place. :)"}
{"text":"I love this atmosphere. I had the brie and it was amazing. The pulled pork is the best i've ever had!!! I would definaly suggest this place to anyone!!!!!"}
{"text":"This pub gives you the ultimate Irish pub experience. Great food, great beer, great staff plus great music!"}
