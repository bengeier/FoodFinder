{"text":"This place is great! From the time you sit down and they bring out the wonton chips (yum!) the environment is very homey and relaxed.   The food is delicious. When we went we had the wonton soup, Chef's special Shanghai pork, Kung Pao Chicken, Moo Goo Gai Pan, and Orange Beef. All the dishes were wonderful. My family in particular was impressed with the Shanghai pork, which we had ordered on a whim but ended up being one of our favorites.  The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, and made the experience fun. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My review is solely based on take out orders. Kung Pao Chicken, Broccoli Beef, Sesame Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken, etc. I've ordered several times from Qwik Chinese & tell you that they live up to the name. Everytime I placed an order for pick up it was ready for me to take home. The owner (looking at the pics from other yelpers) has always greated me when picking up my order. Very friendly and enthusiastic. This is not your average take out. The food is well prepared & the flavors are fused with greatness. The special perk with ordering sweet & sour chicken is that the chicken and sauce are seperated for you to prepare at home with the amount of ratio to your liking. The crab puffs are extremely creamy & rich which are stuffed with the right amount of goods for the money. It has great Chinese Food w/ Scottsdale Prices but...you get what you pay for. Place an order. I'm sure you'll love it."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick meal based on the average 4-star rating we saw on Yelp. Based on our experience we feel compelled to leave our own review. We ordered three dishes; hot and sour soup, seafood treasures, and crispy skin duck. As the soup was being served we noticed the color was off. Upon tasting, we found that not only was it not 'hot' but extremely SALTY. Not wanting to waste food we ate the ingredients; they were ok, but the shrimps tasted like plastic :( Next dish was the Sea-bass, shrimp and vegetables in white garlic sauce. The sauce and veges were okay, but when my husband took a bite of the fish, it was cold inside! We sent it back to be recooked. When it came back it tasted as if they put it in the microwave because the batter became hard and chewy. Last dish was the half Crispy-skin Duck. The color, again, was off. It looked nothing like the picture of the golden-brown crispy-skin poultry we saw on the menu and so attracted. It was dark brown and rather unappetizing. The most disappointing thing was that the skin was not crispy, the duck was dry and most of the pieces were full of bones! It was very hot to the touch.   We generally never waste food and take uneaten food home everywhere we go but we didn't bother here. The waiter was friendly and chatted with us; we felt bad to complain as it was our first visit! Ambiance is pretty good for a Chinese takeout restaurant. They had several wall mounted TVs in every direction and comfy seating, but none of that makes up for the low quality of the 'food'. Our meal costed $40 after tax and tip. Honestly we would have been much happier going to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Qwik China is hands down our favorite chinese restaurant in the valley! The food is amazing, and the owner is our favorite part of the restaurant.  His jovial demeanor always creates a pleasant dining experience, and he remembers names and orders which always makes you happy to come back.   Every meal begins with crispy chips and sweet and sour sauce, and the name doesn't lie! Our food usually comes out within 5 minutes of ordering, and is always made to order. I always get the general tso chicken and add broccoli and it never an issue to customize. My wife gets the kung pao vegetables (no nappa) and they are amazing too. Dining in has a neat sports bar vibe with great happy drink specials, and the take out is lightening fast. We will continue to eat at Quik China for many years to come!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for more than 8 years! Gary the owner is one of the most generous person I know and became really good friends with him. Their food has never changed its flavor and the shrimp choe mein is out of this world! Any food here is great and you can make any spicy. Ive brought all my family and friends here and they love it as well! Best Chinese food out here in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Legit Chinese food, best I've found in AZ.  If you're been looking for Chinese food similar to that on the east coast and been dissatisfied with other places, Qwik Chinese is your place. Friendly staff and super quick service to go along with delicious, fresh-made dishes.  Prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT authentic Chinese food! My fianc√© and I are straight from Long Island NEW YORK a.k.a the state with the worlds best and most authentic Chinese food. We moved to Arizona about two months ago and have been craving some great Chinese food and haven't found anything worth while..until we found this place! Clean, beautiful, beyond generous employees and the food was A+++ we just finished eating there and already can't wait to eat there again! Thank you for the wonderful food and hospitality we will be back!!!!   -extremely satisfied customer"}
{"text":"Best chicken lo mein I've ever had! Sesame chicken was wonderful too! The staff was so friendly and welcoming, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was a surprising find. We had no idea this restaurant was here, but decided to give it a try. Upon walking in, the staff greeted us. Very outgoing and friendly.  The food is New York style Chinese, which we have missed. They have a number of draft beers, including Kirin, on tap. I had the sizzling rice and chicken. It was tasty and well seasoned. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Service is quick?  Whoever said that was paid by the resturant.  Service was s l o w!!!!! Food was pretty good, but just be prepared to wait for it. The 3 stars are for the food. Service gets 0."}
{"text":"Based upon the other reviews, I'm pretty surprised this was so disappointing. I had delivery to my hotel. There was no care to ensure the sauce didn't spill. The bottom of the bag was full of sauce and it made a giant mess. The meal itself was not very good. The chicken was VERY over cooked. The eggroll and soup both had a strange taste...not bad, just strange. If I had to guess, it's pork fat."}
{"text":"Qwik Chinese Bistro is a diamond in the rough. It's on the same half-mile stretch of 90th street as at least 3 other Chinese food restaurants. I've been here once, and it's already taken over my spot the favorite.  I ordered Kung Pao chicken, as I have at almost every Chinese place in the Valley. The dish was spicy, well-balanced, and full of flavor. I would give the food 4/5 stars. However, the service and hours make up for the other star. I work at the hospital, and I've been dreaming of a spot I can get Chinese food even when it's late (they are open until midnight everyday.) The gentleman who served me, even though it was takeout, impressed me with his hospitality and was very accommodating, making sure I had a plate with my to go order. This is rare, and very appreciated.  UPDATE - The quality has gone down. The chicken is not being prepared as thoroughly as when the place opened. There is more gristle and veins, which I absolutely can not stand. I've deducted two stars and I've stopped going."}
{"text":"We purchased a groupon for this restaurant.   We went for lunch.   The employee grunted at us and pointed to the tables when we arrived.    When we sat, he advised us the groupon was not valid for lunch.  The groupon stated it was not valid for the lunch specials, but said nothing about lunch. We did not want the lunch specials, we wanted to order off the regular menu. .   We advised the employee of the terms, he said it was not his problem.  We asked to speak with the manager, he said the manager was not in, and we could not utilize the groupon.    I would not recommend this establishment to anyone based on this level of customer service we had.   I also would not advise purchasing the groupon, as they will not honor the terms and conditions the establishment themselves provided.  I would prefer to give zero stars, but that is not an option."}
{"text":"I had the ginger fish and it was cooked to perfection and really tasty. Generous portion too. Father in law had mushu chicken, tasty and generous as well. Wife had teriyaki chicken bowl with veggies and she's not easy to please and she loved it. So much food we all took some home. Staff knowledgeable and friendly. Excellent food, excellent service and price. Major thumbs up for Qwik!"}
{"text":"I love the food but it's too stuffing I'm not fat it's just true that there food is way too stuffing and our waiter is annoying"}
{"text":"Wow, nice surprise! This family owned restaurant knows great Chinese cooking with fresh ingredients, good service, and reasonable prices! Gary the owner is so great and meets everyone, to ensure happiness, and satisfaction. It's a gotta try!!!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Quik Chinese Bistro for about 20 years. The food is always great! The owner Gary is very friendly & always makes an extra effort to make sure everything is perfect. One of our favorite dishes is General Tao's Chicken. I highly recommend for both dine in and take-out."}
{"text":"This place is great. Service is excellent.  Delivery is fast.  They are kind and after only a few visits they knew us and we are now regulars.  Most importantly, the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and a great, clean atmosphere! Staff was friendly and made it even better."}
{"text":"The second you walk in, Gary greets you by name, with a handshake and a hug. From the deco to tablecloths to the full bar, the atmosphere is always inviting. Best part about this place is the 'home kitchen' where everything is made fresh to order with great tasting ingredients. Best Chinese food in Scottsdale and the only Chinese food in my stomach! Thanks Gary!!!!"}
{"text":"My family ordered a lot of chinese food for christmas day, and we were extremely underwhelmed. For starters, the crispy duck was $25.00 for almost all bones, and lacked any flavor. we also had to pay for the fortune cookies and at least half of the fortune cookies had no fortunes. we tried to branch out from our usual place, super dragon, and were extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this food is GOOD!  The pot stickers are amazing....no seriously...... amazing.  All of our food was mouth watering and delicious and made just the way we had asked.  Fun that they serve beer and wine and have TV's everywhere for sports watching.  We will go back every week for our Chinese food fix.  We met the owner Gary, what a great guy and experience.  Love this place.."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and exceptionally friendly service.  The orange chicken and crab puffs are awesome!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  The beef is. Dry tender, nothing is too sweet or salty.  They have $3 Kirin Ichiban on tap!!!  This is my go to for lunch or dinner!!!  The owner always remembers me and my order, you just don't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Groupon and ordered delivery last night. We LOVED it! I had the Qwick Broccoli Chicken and sizzling rice soup. Both were great! As far as delivery, they were super nice when I called and our food got here pretty quickly. Highly recommend and I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Gary is the best owner. He gets to know his customers and loves what he does.  The food is awesome. I typically get noodles or soup... So tasty. Service is quick and whenever I do take out, it never takes them longer than 5 minutes to make my food. if you're looking for your go-to Chinese restaurant, look no further!"}
{"text":"Panda Express quality at PF Chang's prices, not a fan. Another concern was that there were only 2 tables on a Saturday night. I also made the mistake of checking the restaurant rating on Maricopa.gov while I was waiting for my food. Needless to say, they don't have the most stellar health inspections, I may not have gone if I had seen it before. Overall, I give it a 2 because the service was good but the food was lacking any imagination."}
{"text":"This could well be the best, real Chinese food east of SF.  Problem is, it is undiscovered so far, in that there was a really bad place there before.  Fabulous everything. Orange beef, Moo-shoo pork, Crispy duck, Garlic shrimp, Chinese spare ribs, hot and sour soup.    Big portions, reasonable prices, great service...even Kiren and Stella on tap."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese food places.  They have great tasting fresh food and are quick at getting to go orders ready."}
{"text":"Really oily and just nasty Chinese food. Best part was the wonton with the lunch menu and the egg roll."}
{"text":"I had great hopes for this place as most of the reviews were glowing regarding the food and service. Went for an early dinner at 4:30 and had a quick meal of a large won ton soup, combination fried rice and kung pao chicken.  We were wary of ordering too much as our experience of Asian food in AZ, hasn't been a pleasant one. I don't know whether this is under new ownership or not but by the looks of the front door and the fingerprints all over them and the handmade signs, they are def short of a cleaning crew.   The large won top soup had about 4 chicken/pork wontons in them and was more broth then wontons and veggies. I consider this a one portion small wonton soup and certainly not the large size that they're advertising.  My hubby complained the soup was very salty and we ended up fighting for the veggies that were sparsely floating around the medium sized bowl. I thought the taste was okay, but it would of been better if the soup was served hot like it just came from the stove top. The first 2-3 spoonfuls were lukewarm and it got colder by the minute. If you've been reading my reviews you know this is a big yuk and pet peeve of mine.  As far as our entree, we weren't starved so we ordered only one dish thinking that the kung pao would be just fine for the both of us. When our order came, it looked like a nice amount of food and it looked tasty.   Except for the two things that make a diner go ugh after they've tasted the food:  1) Lukewarm food, both entree and the fried rice 2) Seeing the grisly almost grey looking pieces in the fried rice that we decided to put on a separate plate and not eat because it looked mysterious, uncooked and of course cold  At the end of the day, it was another disappointing foray into trying to find a decent Chinese restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time yesterday, but I'll definitely be back.  Ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch special (entree, fried rice, spring roll, and crab puff) which was under $10 including tax and a fountain drink.  The highlights: -Hot and sour soup was fantastic -Entree was ready less than a minute from finishing the soup. -Chicken breading was hot and crispy, and had just the right amount of sauce -Spring roll that came with the meal was fresh and very flavorful. -Portion sizes at lunch felt perfect for me.  I'm a big guy and was extra-hungry, and while I cleared my plate I felt satisfied, not \"stuffed\". -Woman who seated me (the manager, I think?) was very friendly and polite. -Very fast service... from walking in to walking out was about 30 minutes flat, and I did not rush. -Decor is simple and tasteful, not gaudy. -Whole dining area was very clean, no offensive smells  This is definitely a \"hidden gem\".  Highly recommended if you're in the area for lunch!"}
{"text":"Accidentally ordered from this location, (we order from McCormick frequently). Oh well. Went to pick up our order and we were disappointed when we got home . Missing a spring roll, our crab puffs were BURNT, we received egg fried rice, (which I ordered no egg because my son has an egg allergy), and the sauce to the sesame chicken was so thick it was gross looking, which made it hard to eat. This is our same order at McCormick - which is 5 stars, every single time. Also these portions were WAY smaller. Bummed I ordered from here on accident. Waste of $30."}
{"text":"I walked in starved and confused. The owner and lady waitress ( maybe his wife but didn't ask) were very kind and very welcoming. They straitened me out and made my normally complicated and picky dining experience easy. Not too crowded but with enough bustle to make it comfy. Highly recommend walnut chicken. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I was so very pleased with kind service. The food was amazing !!! I'll be back. I had , pot stickers, orange chicken and egg roll. Yum yum"}
{"text":"You can't imagine how thrilled I was to find that Local Dines had a coupon for my favorite restaurant that made my favorite dish incredibly well.  Ordered my usual Shrimp with Lobster NY style (with added pork) and chicken fried rice.  Immediately the waitress told me that the added pork would be an additional $2 instead of the usual $1.  She said everything has gone up.  Gas hasn't gone up, dear, and certainly pork hasn't.  But OK, charge me the extra dollar.   My dish arrived looking like scrambled eggs had been dropped into the sauce. Solid pieces of egg.  Shrimp with lobster sauce has egg in the sauce but never like this--it is subtle and delicate.  Then I took a taste.  Pure sugar.  Maybe that is an exaggeration.  But sweet enough that I spit it out.  Then I noticed the shrimp. They were cut in half.  After counting the pieces there were 8, meaning 4 actual shrimp.  Really?  Is that what restaurants do when they offer a coupon?  My sadness was the realization that whoever made those wonderful Shrimp and Lobster for me in the past is gone and clearly I will not be tasting that deliciousness again.  Sadness.  After the taste, I called the waitress over to complain about the dish.  She knows me well enough that she was surprised as this was my go-to dish at this restaurant.  It used to be delicious.  Not today.  I asked her for a menu to re order and when I said I wanted beef with mushroom sauce she said this too would be sweet because brown sauce is sweet.  Not always, I thought.  But I went with her recommendation of shrimp with vegetables in a white sauce.  Upon the dish's arrival I tasted the shrimp.  Or shall I say the half shrimp.  There was the sweetness again.  Sweet in not a good way.  Oh, I get it.  How stupid was I!  There they were! The same shrimp that were taken off the first dish that I rejected were back on my plate with a different sauce.  How clever my waitress was to persuade me to get another shrimp dish.  Makes sense to me now.  They recycled the shrimp I didn't like in the first dish and fed it to me one way or the other in the second dish.  Except for one thing --I couldn't eat them either.  The waitress came by and asked me about the substitute dish and I told her that it appeared as if the shrimp had been transferred from one dish to another.  She didn't deny it.  She answered: \"But, it's EDIBLE, right?\"    So sad that one of my favorite Chinese restaurants has resorted to serving incorrectly prepared food, half-sized, cut up shrimp to save money and recycling the rejected food of a patron.   I dread the thought that it might be  even worse than I thought.  The shrimp that were served to me could have been from one of the leftover plates from the birthday party guests who were leaving just as I sat down.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"I don't get all of the high reviews. I drove over 7 miles for takeout because the reviews here were so great. What a huge disappointment and waste of $20. Got back with general so's chicken and it was just awful. Coating was mushy and falling off.. not a crispy coating with that great sauce and quality of meat was low & had lots of fat. Had no taste at all...bland. Fried rice had an off taste. Had a few bites because I was starving, but the rest is going in the trash. Thank god for the spring roll, that was good.  Has to be the worse Chinese food I have ever ordered. Shame because the customer service when I picked it up was great. Very pleasant and polite. Restaurant was nice and clean, but not one person inside eating."}
{"text":"The rice was old and I let the lady know it was gross and she didn't care she looked at me like I was crazy and made me pay for it. She didn't even apologize or ask if I wanted new rice. The whole thing was gross the sauce was salty and thick the wonton was stale the soup was like snot. I asked for a manager she said they weren't there. I told her to try the nasty rice. I ask to talk to the cook she said he didn't speak English. She told me I should've told her earlier, but she never came to the table. I had to go get her and tell her the food was gross. Horrible food horrible service."}
{"text":"Very, very good food! We got seated as soon as we walked in, our glasses were filled as soon as they were half way done, and the waitresses were so incredibly nice! The food was delicious. Overall amazing experience and food quality."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. Consistency is lacking. My first dine-in and delivery meals were outstanding. I had thought \"Found my local Chinese Restaurant\". But no so much these days. Last two dine-ins have been mediocre at best. Egg rolls used to be served piping hot (the old style), crispy and delicious. Now medium hot/cold and soggy. Egg Foo Yung also a favorite in the past is not so much anymore.  The worst was when my wife ordered the house fried rice 'very spicy'. It was brought to the table swimming in chili oil. YUK. Had to send it back twice. The final version did not have the oil, but was riddled with whole hot peppers (I would say about 50 in one dish). Was it because we ordered spicy or was it because we sent it back twice. I leave that up to the reader."}
{"text":"Finally great Chinese delivery! We were so happy to finally find delivery Chinese food that has great taste! Love it so far - tried 3 times."}
{"text":"Good food at a very reasonable price and good sized portions with fast service. Shrimp Szechwan is very good, highly recomendable if you like spicy food"}
{"text":"I ordered steamed broccoli and shrimp.  When the order arrived, the broccoli and shrimp were room temperature; the broccoli did not seem fresh or freshly steamed; and there were only 5 shrimp.  For an order that was almost $20, the order was small and I expected much more.  This has to be the worst food I have ordered and I will not order again from them."}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale this week and after having a terrible experience at Akita sushi we ended up here. great service and the food was awesome.... I would definitely recommend to all ... skip Akita and go to a great place with great owners"}
{"text":"Great service! And delicious food :) yum. I hear they're open for Xmas! Always my first  choice for authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese!  Gary did it again with this location and we love coming in to watch sports on a Saturday afternoon. Best Chinese in AZ!"}
{"text":"Out of town and  found this place.. no combo dinner meals which we prefer but the food was fabulous!! Highly recommed.. Happy Hour everyday and all day long.. Will come again"}
{"text":"Qwik Chinese Has an incredible happy hour. Appetizers at such low prices and they have the best rice bowls...,Kung Pao chicken, spicy beef, orange chicken and many others. Fantastic spring rolls! They also have $2 DRAFT BEERS with a choice of 10 different beers!!    The manager, Jay, is super nice and accommodating (he makes great vodka sodas as well).  Great place to go for happy hour and get some delicious food, drinks and relax. Always have a game on too.  Very great, relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place.  When you think Chinese food you think restaurant. This place is a Chinese sports bar, truly awesome!  Great drink specials and the average plate is $1-$5 cheaper than any decent Chinese restaurant I've been too."}
{"text":"Gave the Bistro a try after years of being a Qwik Chinese shopping center restaurant customer.  Very enjoyable.  New York, East Coast style is new to me, and that's great, Something good and new for a change.  As everyone says, Gary is great.  Always nice to be welcomed and appreciated.  There are several TVs so its a good hang out for sure.  Will be back when in the mood for Chinese and the game is on."}
{"text":"This is for a to-go order:  Great customer service. Friendly, personable manager. Food was ready within 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here! It's super tasty for the price, not to mention Jackie's friendly service. I will definitely make this place my go to Chinese food restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Phoenix! There's not much of an Asian culture here so every chance I get to scour for some Chinese food, I do.   Gary is the owner here and it seems like he has a lot of regulars coming in all the time. He treats everyone like family and always has a smile on his face. We chat about something new every time I see him. I've never seen him in a bad mood at work. You can tell his passion is food.  Now onto the food!   The food on the menu is the usual Chinese food you see at a Chinese restaurant. But the beef they have isn't the thick chewy kind that gets stuck in your teeth. The chicken is moist and not overcooked or hard. The vegetable dishes have a decent amount of vegetables and they always taste fresh and crunchy. I am also salt sensitive and this place knows how not to over or under season food. It is juuuuust right.  The food and service here is great! I happily go out of my way to eat here!"}
{"text":"It's a rarity to find such good Chinese food in this area. The restaurant is spacious, clean, comfortable, and most of all welcoming. Plenty of TVs to view, and a large variety of beers on tap. Having even just the beers in a Chinese restaurant is different and exciting. The food is well presented, and absolutely delicious. This place is definitely not your everyday Chinese cuisine and establishment. The owner, Gary, is passionate and you can tell he truly cares about the customer. Try the potstickers!"}
{"text":"Gary is the man!! He calls me noodle girl every time I order! They are all so friendly, amazing food, and tvs all over the place! Their take out is great as well! By far one of the best in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here based on the close proximity to where I work and they do deliver within the area. There seems to be a lot of mixed reviews on here so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, but my experience wasn't too bad. The interior decor is very typical of what you would see at other Chinese restaurants. As for the food I tried a lunch special which was the Cashew Chicken and I would have to say it was about average. I did enjoy the sauce that they used which luckily wasn't too overpowering and the egg drop soup was pretty good. Other than that nothing really much to write home about.  The customer service was not nearly as bad as I had imagined as well, but then again the restaurant was not busy at the time that I went. I did notice that the staff here do speak Chinese so there is some authenticity to be had here and that can't be said for other Chinese restaurants. I do wish that the food was somewhat better here though but this is a decent run of the mill place, just don't expect anything special."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Especially for the value. Food came out quickly and fresh. Jackie was awesome. Awesome service!! I ordered the beef and broccoli. My wife had the sizzling rice soup, and my sister in law had the Kung pao chicken everything was tasty and well portioned. We will return on out next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Delicious food, lots of menu options, reasonable prices for this area of Scottsdale, and it's usually quiet when I visit in the evenings.  Great place to catch a game too!"}
{"text":"Consistently a great place--food is delicious and comes to the table hot and ready to be eaten.  Huge menu with more choices than imaginable.  Went last night and met Jay, the new owner, who is a great guy with restaurant and customer service experience.  He took over from Gary and continues the same outstanding service food and environment.  They deliver and you can order on their website, making it really easy. Great neighborhood restaurant and one I continue to enjoy.  PS- the Won Ton soup was amazing as were the pot stickers and egg rolls ( it was a night of appetizers)"}
{"text":"Good service and typical food.  Nothing standout but nothing negative to warn you away from either.  Try it if the mood strikes."}
{"text":"When I walked up the front door was wide open.  The air wasn't on so it was stuffy inside. It looks like a c.f. ross between a sports bar and Chinese restaurant. The place has a fully stocked bar and Tv's all over the place. Cool atmosphere. The food, nor the best.  I has the Mongolian (sp) Beef and it was pretty bland. So many white and green onions. The rice was very dry and the spring roll had a really strange taste to it. The egg drop soup was good though. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with a \"Local Dine\" Coupon that I paid $15 for and they would not honor. Seems they changed ownership and would not honor the \"Local Dine\" coupon...so they \"ticked\" me off. Then the food was below average for Chinese. Would go to Jade Palace or Quick Chinese in McCormick before I would go back there again. Will tell my family and friends the same."}
{"text":"Great food ,excellent service and kid friendly . You get treated like family here and not a customer . The prices are not ridiculous . Won Ton chips are extremely addicting . Orange chicken and vegetable Lo mein was extremely delish"}
{"text":"The only place you should buy potstickers! They are to die for here!! Almost a meal all by themselves! The owner, Gary, is always there and always cooking! He knows his stuff! Treat yourself to a fine meal as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and very accommodating! I love how you don't need to wait for too long for your food. Highly recomment"}
{"text":"I called in an order forty minutes before closing when I went I pick up he ask \" why such a late dinner?\" And seemed mad I ordered food even though they were still open another half hour. When I got home I saw that my chicken was clearly reheated and pulled chicken not the fried battered chicken that normal sweet n sour chicken is made with ( and how it is described in menu) . The food was really horrible and I would not recommend anyone going there"}
{"text":"Excellent food . First time having it delivered .  Outstanding.  Egg rolls were amazing and Kung pao chicken was phenomenal.  My mom usually doesn't eat much but did not hesitate to get seconds.  Her favorite was the Singapore noodles ."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great delivery service and highly recommend the orange tofu. The hot and sour soup and vegetable lo mein are also wonderful choices."}
{"text":"We always have a great experience here. We order through Grubhub and always have a correct order and very tasty!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for my first UberEats delivery. It must have been because I wasn't there, and maybe that made it ok somehow to bag a container of water and made it look like curry... (Although the color at least had me fooled) and a box of tasteless noodles with no meat... Although The 2 shrimps I found were a pleasant surprise. They call it Singapore noodles on the menu, but at this point I call for a refund!"}
{"text":"Beware - Ordered through Uber-Eats.  Horrible excuse for edible food.  Management/ownership does not care.  My time spent providing them with thoughtful feedback was met with being yelled at by manager/owner and hung up upon.  FOR SHAME."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Finally got a chance to have dinner instead of doing take out. The service was outstanding and they make sure you are happy with everything. The potstickers are amazing and the rest of the food was also very tasty and Qwik. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food and speedy delivery! Their definitely my go to for quick dinner or something special for the family!!!"}
{"text":"Quik Chinese? Not so much...I've been here twice and both times I have had painfully long dining experiences. The first time I ate at QC at least the food was decent (hence the 2-star rating), this second time around everything was terrible.  First mistake = coming here on Christmas Day (around 5:30pm) - but I had nothing at home to eat, and there weren't many dining options open except for Chinese. George & Son's had a 50 minute wait, and we were quoted 20 minutes at QC so we decided to eat here.  We walked in to a fairly full restaurant, and our first red flag should have been the sight of the staff (all 5 of them) frantically running around, except for a young 10-year old girl who was seating guests....  It took quite a bit of time to get our drinks and appetizers out to the table but the real disaster came with the time we had to wait for our entrees. Between finishing our appetizer and receiving our entree plates, it had to be at least 45 minutes. In that time we saw multiple tables get up and leave due to not having any service, which at first was amusing, and then turned to annoyance.   Repeatedly there was a gentleman (who seemed to have come into the restaurant to help his buddies during dinner service because they were so backed up) who told tables, \"sorry folks, we didn't think we'd be so busy today!\" Well - it is Christmas, and you're the only restaurant open...c'mon man.  When the food finally got to our table, the same gentleman came with the plates and said to us, \"Does this look like the food you ordered?\" Uhh, what!? You tell me guy, you're the one who works here...plus almost all Chinese food looks the same, so, sure?  The last straw was that the food was terrible, cold, and unappetizing. Poor marks all around. Running a restaurant when you're slow is easy, a true mark of a decent restaurant is managing and being capable when you're busy.  I know its Chinese food, but still, let's keep some sort of standards here folks. You know it's bad when you leave saying, \"We should have just eaten at Taco Bell.\" Too bad they were closed."}
{"text":"Pretttty good asian. The old owner Gary was a good friend, so miss him but the new place is fairly up to par. Great soups, very sweet sauces."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the portions are big enough, food is really good and the staff is very friendly! Lo mein is a must have item from their menu!"}
{"text":"Sports and Chinese food, what more can I say! If you're tired of the same old wings and burgers, do yourself a favor and come in to meet Gary, Jackie and the rest of the staff for an enjoyable afternoon/evening.  Gary, the owner, prides himself on the quality of the food that his chef's are preparing as well as the draft beer selection to include Kirin, Modelo Especial, San Tan, Dos XX, as well as a few others.   The restaurant is nicely decorated, comfortable and welcoming with plenty of room for larger groups and families so do yourself a favor, stop in, have a beer or glass of wine with some delicious food and you'll probably become a regular. Even if you're just looking for quick take-out, I'm sure you'll enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is not a bad restaurant for a quick lunch break except that you get constantly interrupted by the staff asking you if you're doing ok. Please, let me eat in peace."}
{"text":"Ordered pick-up for 7 of us one night. It's decent but that's about it if I'm being honest. When I went in to pick up the order I met the owner and he is a super nice guy. had a big smile on his face a ton of energy and personality and seemed just like a genuinely good guy.   However here's a couple reasons for the 3-star rating:  - I was told it would be ready in x amount of time... I got there right on time and had to wait over 20 minutes to get the order.  - Food quality was just alright. 1/3 of the flavor I was wanting at a full price tag. Disappointing to say the least.  - my mom has a favorite dish that she always orders with Chinese food and it's actually pretty straightforward and simple. She likes to get chicken fried rice, no vegetables, extra egg..that's it. Somehow they got it horribly wrong - no chicken, extra egg AND vegetables. First world problems for sure but still...  Ugh...and it could have been do much better"}
{"text":"Gary is so welcoming every time we come in. The service is fast and food is always delicious. QCB has the best gyoza's in the valley hands down.  They are so big and fresh, filled with delicious pork!   Bravo!! 10 stars"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Chinese food.  Stopped for an early dinner. The staff is very friendly and the owner truly cares. I had Cashew Chicken with hot and sour soup.  The meal was very good. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  Clean inside and nicely decorated.  Easy to find ad well."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It has a cool vibe--fun and interesting atmosphere.  The owner is such a friendly and upbeat guy.  His positive attitude is infectious.  The food is just really good Chinese food.  The variety is excellent and you can find good meat, fish, noodles, rice and veggies.  You can't go wrong here and the prices are very good too."}
{"text":"I can't speak highly enough about their Veggie Lo Mein. Favorite dish. This place would have 5 stars if everything was that good.   This time around, we picked up a couple dishes. The 2 orders of hot and sour soup were lukewarm. There was an eggshell in one of our orders, and the General TSO's chicken was inedible and got thrown in the trash."}
{"text":"This is the Chinese food we have been looking for in this area! The pricing is excellent and delivery fee is cheap, making this an affordable and delicious option. The sesame chicken was the best I've ever had and the lo mein was great as well. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Walked in to have a beer and get takeout - $3 for any draft beer? Awesome start! Bartender was very friendly and attentive. Chicken Lo Mein and Egg Rolls were excellent and came out quickly. Gary called me by name after running my card for payment - nice touch."}
{"text":"Great food, delivery service, quantity of food! Love this place and been going here for years. Those people complaining I'm guessing are the Snobsdale people who are too lazy to go out and expect 5 star service delivered to their house!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place. But I got food poisoning the last time I was there. For God Sake, The rice smelled funny when I ate the first spoon. It was old rice, they take whatever that they have in the kitchen for you, I hope that they had focused more on the quality of the plate. After we're done eating, we went to ikea. I felt extremely cold for some reasons, I kept shaking like crazy. I thought that it was just the weather. Andmy head started to spin. We had to come home as fast as possible so that I can lay down. I had to skip school the next day. It was so unpleasant. If anyone don't believe this, say whatever you want. But better be careful. I have no reason to against thier business. I'm a culinary student and I have learned a lot about food safety and how it effects one person's health. You can't buy health"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Got the lunch special Almond Chicken. Portion was awesome and came with crab puff and wonton. Quality was subpar. Chicken was fatty and chewy (I hate that). Chicken felt slimey too. Fried rice was usual. Egg drop was usual. Not going back.  Nice people, clean, and not expensive at all though!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. So much so, that I gave them several chances to remind me of that long lost love affair. Last 3 out of 3 times has been terrible. My hot and sour soup came to me about the color of mustard. And it was sickeningly sweet. My fried wontons were virtually meatless, and my combo fried rice didn't have any discerning flavor at all. $20 later and all i can say is that I'm so disappointed.  I will never order from them again. I will stick with Red House for my wonton fix and continue to search for a go to place for fried rice."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and a great happy hour.   General Tsao's chicken and the Chef's special are both fantastic.  Cheap and a lot of quality food."}
{"text":"Really good food, I ordered the sesame chicken and it was delicious. The chicken was crispy and not soggy like at most restaurants and it was 100% white meat. I can't wait to eat here again and try something new"}
{"text":"Have seen this restaurant for quite some time yet never had a chance to come in until now. I'm so glad we did. The service was great! The food was fantastic.! I had the extra spicy Kung Pao chicken. It was great! The egg rolls are also excellent. The Olympic bird nest was amazing! The wine was decent too!"}
{"text":"Love the Kung pao shrimp from here ! Plus the boss is real nice and goes around asking if the food was good, so friendly"}
{"text":"Honestly... Amazed by the service. It's not some top notch French service style. But the people running this joint are as kind as they come.  My friend and I were going in for some take out... We decided to dine in at the bar instead. Beers are 3.00 all summer! Excellent selection too! Our food was stellar. The orange chicken was ridiculously good... The crab puffs were amazing... And the Pot Stickers were like legal crack. So good!  I walked out saying \"WOW, what nice people and what delicious food... I wish I lived closer so that I could come more often.\"  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Alway great food and service in both of the qwik Chinese. Been coming for years. The draft beer is only for 3 dollar, drink and Chinese food, great combination."}
{"text":"First time tonight I ordered take out, everything was perfect; on time, hot, tasty and friendly delivery. My new go to Chinese take out. Thanks"}
{"text":"So glad to see this new place getting well-deserved recognition. We loved the McCormick Ranch location but the Bistro is even better. The beer taps and flat screen TV's remain from a previous tennant, making for a truly unique \"Casual Chinese Sports Grill\" ambiance. The food is delicious, the service is warm and attentive and this place just fits my family perfectly. Not a lot of unique and unpretentious places in North Scottsdale - a true hidden gem."}
{"text":"We have only eaten here once as we are from out of town.  We went there based on yelp reviews.  The service was excellent. Staff makes you feel very welcome!  On this experience the food was just okay.  My husband and I both had kung pao chicken. The sauce was okay, the veggies were cooked just right, but the amount of chicken and peanuts were a little skimpy."}
{"text":"I think the only thing that I liked was how fast the food was prepared for pickup.   The kung pao chicken and Szechuan chicken were both total failures.   The Szechuan may as well have been Szechuan soup - the sauce was filled to the brim almost submerging the chicken and veggies. The sauce lacked flavor and especially spice. I actually poured about 2/3 a cup of the broth down the sink and still had a ton to the point I had to pour it out of the container and on to a plate with edges to prevent it from getting on everything. The chicken was off, something about the cut of meat used or something was off. Texturally some of the pieces were very unpleasant and inconsistent with chicken you expect in this dish.  The Kung pao chicken was equally lacking in taste and spice. My gf got this dish and I tried it in lieu of mine and had one bite and moved back to mine. Hers didn't have the broths problem but it had the lack of flavor problem and the same textural issue with a few of the pieces of chicken.   The fried rice seemed like it was ok, could use a bit more egg and a couple additional diced veggies but the flavor wasn't bad. This is the only reason for the 2 star review vs 1.  I highly doubt I would eat at this place again based on first impressions but was happy to try it with the 4 star overall review.   Sorry for reviewing so negatively, hopefully others don't share similar taste experiences and enjoy their dinner a bit more!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Hot & Sour Soup was the best I've ever had.  Wife and kids had beautiful egg rolls.  The Szechuan Delight & Double-Cooked Pork were amazing.  And the service was excellent and accommodating, just like we were guests in their home.  Best Chinese food we've had in the valley, we will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Our go to order includes veggie lo mein, general tsaos chicken and kung pao chicken. They give you the option to order all white meat which makes a huge difference. Also the kung pao has chunks of carrot and celery that we love. Great service for take out. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I simply can't imagine what better Chinese food at this price point would be. Everything was delicious, high quality, and flavorful. The wonderful family owners seem to put pride and love into every dish. Where do you get that at $$ level? We even arrived a bit late (20 minutes before closing), but were welcomed and never made to feel like we had to rush. If you're on the area and looking for some quick and delicious Chinese at a modest price point, this is where you want to go."}
{"text":"I started a new job and this restaurant was one of the highest rated options available nearby.  I had lunch here a few times since, it isn't fantastic food, but it is certainly acceptable.  Unfortunately, today I entered and stood awkwardly for two minutes without being acknowledged. So I then pulled out my phone and called the restaurant which as expected brought a waitress out; I then hung up my phone before she could answer it, but she just continued to ignore me waiting there to be seated."}
{"text":"Got takeout from here last night. The food is always good. But I think it may be under new ownership... they were really understaffed and the portion sizes are MUCH smaller. Usually one dish could easily feed my two kids, but that was not the case this time. Hoping they work on these issues to keep repeat customers happy."}
{"text":"The Mongolian beef was amazing, the meat tender and full of flavor. Service was impeccable. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"We had delivery - the order was messed up and it took forever. Later on they realized they didn't charge my card, but charged a different customer twice and needed me to provide my credit card information again  I wasn't thrilled after having waited so long for my food.  As far as the food itself, I wasn't in love with it. The generals chicken was soggy and chewy - not the crispier spicy chicken I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the staff was so friendly and the food was delicious with big portions. Definitely recommend the crab puffs yummmm"}
{"text":"It was our first time here. We saw them on groupon and gave it a try.  We really liked general Taos chicken the sauce was so good and spicy. Very clean place and nice bar area. Great service."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant ever I tried almost everything on the menu everything is so amazing and clean and they have the best customer service and pulse they have very decent prices"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here several times. The pork fried rice is amazing!  Everything is excellent. We will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! Our office visited after work for some drinks and dinner and had a wonderful experience. Gary and staff took great care of us. Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"It's ironic that this place is named \"Qwik\" when dinner was anything but.  We were fooled greatly by the average 4 star review.  In their defense, the two of us did visit Christmas around 5:20 pm.  However, they weren't that busy when we sat down.  Fast forward 25 minutes and we finally were able flag someone down to place our order and request water for the second time.  It took over 30 minutes to get a bowl of soup and some stir-fried noodles.  During this time, we watched other tables sit for 30+ plus minutes without receiving any service (either placing an order or receiving their food).  We also watched the head waitress argue with a group about their reservation, and she insisted that they couldn't sit where they wanted because another exact same group already had it reserved. The women tried explaining that she thought that was them, but they weren't given the table (BTW the \"other group\" never showed and that group was never allowed to sit at their requested table which remained empty the entire time).    When we finally received our food, my soup did not match the description. The Pacific Seafood Soup was supposed to have shrimp, scallops, crab meat, and egg whites.  It was imitation crab meat (although I expected that), 2-3 tiny scallops, a lot of hard-to-eat squid chunks, and a lot of fish (I ordered this dish over another because of the fact that it wasn't supposed to have fish).  I couldn't find any shrimp at all in my dish.  I flagged over the waitress and asked her if there was any shrimp in it as I stirred it around to show her that I couldn't find any.  She told me that there wasn't any shrimp in it and started to list the things that she saw in it.  Then, the super rude waitress yelled at us from across the room and said that there was shrimp in it. It was just cut up.  Well, that was just complete bulls**t. There was no recognizable shrimp in that soup, but I wasn't prepared to wait another hour to get the correct dish.  It did taste pretty decent for not being what I ordered, and my date enjoyed his noodles although they were spicier than he expected.  As we were finishing up, (6:30 by now) we noticed that many of the tables that were seated shortly after us still didn't have any food on their table.  We couldn't get a waitress's attention to pay the bill, and so my date went up to the rude one while she was at the computer and tried to give her the credit card and she blew him off.  So he returned back to our seat and then were forced to sit there and people watch. Then at one point, they brought the wrong food to the wrong table.  The poor people had been waiting almost an hour for their food and he started yelling at the staff. Then they took his actual order away.  Meanwhile all of the other tables were complaining about how they didn't have any food and literally the entire restaurant was ready to walk out.  Everyone looked completely miserable and I'm surprised it was only the one table yelling at the staff, but we could hear several other tables contemplating if they should just leave. We ended up just throwing a $20 on the table and leaving, but honestly, we probably could have walked out without paying, and they wouldn't have noticed for 20 minutes with all the confusion and disorganization going on."}
{"text":"Gary the owner is very nice and Ya Ping our server is very polite and she and the entire staff are very friendly. For some really great food and fast service, come inside, have a seat and enjoy your meal while watching one of their many TV screens."}
{"text":"Remember when you'd try all those chinese food places and they were all just OK?  Qwik is beyond that.    My girlfriend and I decided to check this place out since it's on our way home.  We were so happy we did!  Here's what I love about some restaurants.. I like when they stick to the basics.  Nothing weird and fusion type foods, nothing you've never heard of.  I'm a pretty basic foodie (though I do love the occasional change!). The flavors of all that we had from Qwik were just amazing.    Of course with food being so good I do tend to stuff myself.. Argg.. Yeah.. The stomach ache was worth it!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Really friendly staff who always remember my wife and I. The delivery is always prompt. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was taken about by how friendly the service was. Just super super genuinely nice people working here and it's a relief because that's hard to find in Scottsdale. The food was delicious, large portions. I LOVE the hot and sour soup. I'm so excited to have this yummy place close to work- I will be back!"}
{"text":"Sipping plum wine is one of the pleasures of civilization; adding a basket of wonton chips pushes it delicately over the cliff to decadence.  Embrace the decadence. Bring a party of four to share dishes, sip plum wine, and discuss the Xiaobi Tangji of Yuan Hongdao. Or if Chinese poetry of the Ming Dynasty doesn't do it for you, there are large-screen TVs which were showing Muppet-like programming when I was there, and which probably turn to sports at some later time. Have a little kung fu with your egg foo.  I had the ginger chicken. For a moment, I thought I was in one of the intellectual suburbs of Boston, where the Chinese restaurants are moderately elegant (this one is, in a reddish-peach scheme) and the food is, too. Only the lack of long-haired fellow diners arguing over Ming Dynasty poetry clued me in that no, this is Scottsdale. The dish was more subtly flavored than the usual local Chinese, without being bland. While it was not the most amazing Chinese I've ever had in my life (that involved oysters at a dive restaurant in a West Coast Chinatown), the combination of bistro-style food and attentive service makes Qwik Chinese a soothing retreat from the chaos of Scottsdale rush hour traffic.  I would write haiku to this ginger chicken, except that haiku is Japanese, so it can be written only to sushi or teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Stopped here by coincidence, i am so glad i did, i had the Chicken Lo Mein it was amazing, probably the best i have had in the phoenix valley. Restaurant has a Great atmosphere, great service, i will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place two stars but it is for the take out order.  We had a groupon and used it tonight.  Do Not get the Chinese Chicken Salad which is nothing like any of the area restaurants but rather is it soaked in hot and spicy soy sauce and only has iceberg lettuce and chicken and it is disgusting, we had to throw it away.  The Won Ton Soup was good, no salty and lots of wontons and pork.  We ordered the large size.  The brown rice has no taste and is boring, they charge extra for brown rice and do not have fried brown rice.  They also say they cook New York Chinese Style which actual is not true.  New York Chinese food has chop suey and chow mein, this place does not have either and is a disappointment.  So I had to get the Chicken and Veggies because I do not like the brown sauce and this is one of the few entrees with white sauce.  This entree is enough for two people, but they do not give you much with it, it is pretty much a la cart.  They gave us barely enough chips and only 2 fortune cookies even though we had more people. gosh could they spare it.  There other place on Hayden is much better food on take out then this place.  I was disappointed in the quality, quantity and taste of this take out food. It was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"so upon reading previous reviews about this place i decided to drop in and see for my self and i thought the food and service were ok, one thing i can say about the place is that they have duck which happens to be my favorite chinese dish which isn't always available at certain places. that being said it wasn't to bad for me and i might drop in again in the near future."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, I totally recommend the Singapore noodles, and the chef Gary...  he's awesome we fell in love with the place and the food!"}
{"text":"Not very good !!!!!hair in my food won't go there anymore make sure never to order the fried shrimp  unless you want a tiny piece of shrimp and a lot of batter"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure reading the reviews but so glad we tried it!! Super fast delivery and great food!! The pork fried rice is excellent. I love the sweet and sour chicken - the portion is enough for 2 servings!!"}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor to the Qwik Chinese restaurant off Via Linda, Qwik Chinese Bistro is amazing. The atmosphere is large, clean and inviting. The staff are extremely friendly and mist importantly, the food is the best around. I've had several dishes...beef and broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce, sesame chicken, but my favorite has been the Qwik Special chicken. A must have if you've never tried. My only complaint is there isn't a Qwik Chinese is the Southeast valley."}
{"text":"They respect allergies and gave us free dumplings. Also the curry was excellently spicy!"}
{"text":"I visited here for many times,and I super into the Singapore style noodle and Qwik special chicken in this restaurant, my roommate make a Qwik special sandwich use the chicken form there, that was so good, and you should try pot stickers from this place,as a Native Chinese I tasted a bunch of pot stickers, and I just think is normal when I first time saw,but when I tasted it,me and my friends both said \"OMG\",it's totally the Chinese North dumplings restaurant style,make my friend homesick."}
{"text":"Chinese take out as good as I've had!  Great chicken wings! Had the Happy Family and Moo Shu Vegetables. Everything tasted fresh and the sauce they use isn't overly sweet and syrupy. We also ordered two Spring rolls and wee fresh and crispy. This is the best Chinese take out I have ever had. This will be our go to take out spot. The restaurant is really nice inside too. They have a nice bar with a couple of TV's that had the baseball and basketball game. It's not a sports bar and isn't loud."}
{"text":"The name lives up to the service. It was quick, delicious, and the owner was very friendly and a funny guy. Although I was disappointed in the duck, the orange chicken, pot stickers, spring roll, and special pork were as good as any Chinese cuisine i' ve had in a while. Overall this place was a good bite to eat but the service/ atmosphere made it a 5 stars for me. It was bloody delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here the other day. I kept it simple with house special fried rice, an egg roll, and crab puffs. Everything was fine and the host was really nice, but it just wasn't good enough to have me go out of my way to return. The rice was too...moist? Maybe overly greasy or overcooked...I honestly couldn't figure out what my issue was with it. The egg roll and crab puffs were SUPER greasy. My \"meal\" (if you want to call a whole bunch of junk food a meal) also came with crispy noodles which were almost too greasy to touch.   I'm fat, and I'm not bothered by eating fried foods or wiping oil off my fingers, but this was a really greasy experience. I think they use the wrong temperature oil.   Maybe their healthy dishes are better. Try those."}
{"text":"We moved to the area a year ago and found this Chinese restaurant on Yelp. The reviews were great so we decided to give it a try! Everything we have ordered from there has been consistently good and their delivery is always impressively quick.   Last night, I picked our order up instead of getting delivery, as I was in the area. The restaurant itself was very nice and the owner who greeted me was incredibly friendly. He knew our order - I ALWAYS get the Qwik Broccoli Chicken (I ask for it a little spicy with extra broccoli) so good and very light for a Chinese dish. My boyfriend has tried several of the pork and chicken items and has never been disappointed. We also love the crab puffs - not too cream cheesy like at some places. :)   I did not realize he had been in business in the area for over 20 years! He also explained that their restaurant is different than the Qwik Chinese restaurant on Hayden. That was his first location he was at for about 20 years and he sold it to someone else and has been at this location for 3 years. The new owners have a different menu. That was good to know since I figured they were the same because of the spelling.   Overall, a solid Chinese delivery experience and very good customer service!"}
{"text":"Went Christmas day for dinner for our traditional Chinese meal.  Started off trying to get into Canton Dragon, which is our go-to spot.  One-hour wait was too much for us, so we decided to try Qwik Chinese Bistro.  We remember this spot when it was China Village - before it was a Native New Yorker.  The place was not packed on Christmas Day - which should have been a sign.  The place is well decorated, modern and clean, but that's about all the positive things I can say about it.  Small portions. Mediocre food.  Weak service.  The portions were incredibly small.  We ordered the special of the day which was salt and pepper squid.  The order never came.  We had to ask for it way after we finished our meal.  We also ordered the roast pork fried rice, beef lo mein and sweet and sour chicken as entrees.  We had hot and sour soup and pot stickers for and appetizer. The \"large\" hot and sour soup filled 4 very small soup cups.  Not more.  The dumplings came eight to an order.  The entree portions were very small.  As far as the food quality, everything was fresh, but not particularly adventurous or special in terms of taste.   Bottom line:  small portions and run of the mill taste will not bring us back.  Forgetting our entree means we can't recommend at any level."}
{"text":"Good restaurant. I'm taking away one star because the rice was served to me in a to- go box, which is weird. I ate the Qwik Special Chicken and it was like a deep fried chicken nugget with sauce on it. Nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't out-of-this world amazing either. I will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great staff. I highly recommend the hot and sour soup. Lovely ambiance and many televisions. Convenient back door for handicapped access. Draught beer $3 all day and good selection. We had duck and moo shy pork, both very good. We will be back.  Sadly, the return was disappointing. The place has gone to average"}
{"text":"We picked up a to-go order. So good! Love their potstickers! Nice thin skins, NOT thick and doughy like most restaurants. Szechuan spicy eggplant was really tasty, good level of heat. Vegetables with garlic sauce was crisp and fresh. Moo Shu pork was really good too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Authentic Chinese food and so delicious. I love their singapore noodles and my boyfriend loves their beef and chicken plates. Price can't be beaten!"}
{"text":"Fantastic general tso's chicken, Mongolian beef and mu shu pork!  The pan fried dumplings were out of this world.  We could not believe the reasonable price for the quantity and quality food.  The food was ready only 15 minutes after our order was placed which was great.  Gary was so nice and helpful on the phone when I made my order and in-person!  We are excited to have found our new local spot for Chinese takeout!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I cannot say enough great things about Qwik's! The beef fried rice was gooood, I myself had Lemon Chicken - here's the thing, it was perfectly fried. The sauce was excellent and my chicken wasn't mushy (my favorite is crispy) AMAZING. My sister had the Qwik's Special Chicken (brown sauce was sooooo perfect) chicken had a terrific flavor and I've had lots of Honey Walnut Shrimp, but hands down this was some of the best. They also do Happy Hour - beers are $2! Sapporo! Last, but not least.. our waitress was sweet and attentive. Definitely excited to have found such a great place."}
{"text":"Food was fresh!  I loved all the veggies in my fried rice.  The delivery guy was nice and he got here fast!"}
{"text":"The five stars is straight up for their dumplings. OK the rest of the Chinese food is pretty good too, but the dumplings... damn. They hand make these babies with a mixture of porky goodness wrapped in chewy fantasy, then steam-fry them, and serve them with Chinese red vinegar. Thinking about them, I am gonna have to make a trip soon. MMM"}
{"text":"Came to this place because it had good recommendations from Yelp. They serve both white and dark meat in their chicken dishes. Not sure if you can request only white meat for additional costs. Loved the vegetable lo mein and pot stickers. Very delicious. The hostess/waitress was very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Excellent all around experience. Friendly, super fun staff, qwick service ;), free wifi, phenomenal food, great prices cute decor and pleasant ambience. I'm so glad they put out a groupon or I wouldn't have thought to try them. Our waiter was super personable and lots of fun. Delicious moo shu, fried rice, walnut shrimp and crab puffs.  When we received our check at the end of the meal, it came with extra fortune cookies, high fives, lollipops for the kids and a 10% off next visit discount. A lot of higher end restaurants in this North Scottsdale neighborhood could learn a lot about customer service from Gary and his staff. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The food is exceptional. Always consistently good , try the Happy Family and the Singapore noodles!  Sooo good."}
{"text":"NO NO NO... Per yelpers rating, visited this bistro. Did not work for our family. Owner Gary, is blunt and did not seem to be customer friendly. Absolutely no crowd, we were the only family on Sunday afternoon for lunch. Very greasy food, the chips served were stale. Chicken fired rice was actually 'fried' rice...We asked the server to take it back. If you care for your health, this is not the place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  They make you feel at home, part of the family.  House fried rice is awesome.  Wonton soup is and works like Mom's chicken soup.  Happy Family, Dragon & Phoenix, Mu Shu Pork are my favorites.  Delivery is fast.  Food very hot."}
{"text":"I won a gift certificate here from my sons elementary school. Would have never tried it otherwise. I'm glad we won it though because now we have a regular Chinese food restaurant in Scottsdale! We were seated quickly, food was great, arrived quickly as well. Our server was so sweet and helpful. The chef came out and checked on our food, too. Excellent customer service. Plus, can't beat $3 beers!"}
{"text":"My son has lived in Scottsdale for several years and has been a frequent flyer at Quick Chinese Bistro. He introduced me to this great place when I moved here in 2015 and I can't get enough!

{"text":"Alright. This was frickin delicious. I have been deprived of good Chinese food for some time, and Qwik really hit the spot.   We ordered crab Rangoon which seemed to be handmade. They were flaky and yummy. Our main meal was general tso chicken and egg fried rice. The general tso was perfect; crispy and lightly battered, delicious sauce, good white pieces of chicken - no mystery meat or chewy grizzle pieces in sight. The rice was fresh and delicious.   Lastly, the owner, Gary, is so friendly and upbeat. All around a five star experience. Bomb!"}
{"text":"Ordered family style which started off with a little something from the restaurant - Deep Fried Won Ton which you generally see with egg drop soup. Our order were for appetizers, the Pot Stickers which in an order came with 8 good size jewels. They were good size pan fried nicely with a dipping sauce. We ordered family style and had the Singapore Noodles, Orange Chicken, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Mongolian Beef and Half Duck. Would recommend the Singapore Noodles, which had shrimp, beef and chicken in a thin Noodle which was very tasty, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, which was probably the best dish as the Shrimp were medium size, shelled and a light crisp sauce applied mixed in a chopped array of vegetables of a stir fried blend. The Orange Chicken was also a nicely prepared dish with a generous serving.  The Mongolian Beef was flavorful but was okay and as for the Duck, once you have had the traditional roast duck, you don't want it prepared any other way and it came pan fried or something other than the traditional way and was more bone than meat.  Overall it seemed as though this restaurant may better serve the Buffet style crowd during lunch time rather than the old traditional Chinese people looking for old style Cantonese food.  I will say again, the Pot Stickers, Singapore Noodles and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp was something I would recommend you try.  Honestly not my first choice for Traditional Chinese Food, but will keep them in mind."}
