{"text":"New York City sports fans probably should stay away; this is seriously a Boston-themed sports bar.  Or maybe it is a pizzeria, or then again, maybe a diner.

The menu probably could use some editing; there is something for everyone here, but our fried ravioli appetizer suggested that maybe they should stick to what they do well.

That being said, the pizza that we had, Prosciutto's House, with, appropriately enough, prosciutto, mozzarella, and feta, was as good as pizza gets.

We were there on a weeknight, but the service was attentive.  There is a fairly good selection of beers and wines, both of which were served cold.  It is a friendly and comfortable place with great pizza."}
{"text":"First of all we got here at 5:15 pm. The server said seat yourself. After five minutes of sitting we were told the seats were reserved. Completely contradicting the hostess. Our waiter was rude to us the entire evening and failed to provide good service. For a majority of the night myself and friends did not have refills and were rarely checked on. In addition to that we waited over an hour for our food that was mediocre at best. After finishing our meal it took an additional 30 minutes for our check. Overall a terrible experience. Would not recommend if you are looking for a nice evening."}
{"text":"Small bar, restaurant is FILLED with unattended children which makes parents feel free to make the problem worse (see Kay's oblivious review, she must let her kids run free... no wonder she gave 5 stars for the free daycare). Sorry Mom, its not cute when little Jimmy tugs on my leg while the hostess ignores me for 10 minutes instead of taking my name... I ran outta here without ordering."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after taking a chance with a Groupon. Unlike a lot of Groupon spots, this place hit on all points. Really vibrant, lots of customers on a Thursday night. Service was fast and friendly, prices are amazing (good drink specials too) in relation to the portion sizes, and the food was great. One of the better local pizzas for sure. A fun and comfortable atmosphere (in spite of all the Boston sports stuff on the walls). Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Skip it. Reminds me of an old smoking bar you would find in some vacation town.
I ordered a pizza for take out. This was the worst pizza I have had since moving here and over priced; $25 for a large that was obviously not fresh ingredients. 
I paid for this mistake in the bathroom later. 

Never stepping in again."}
{"text":"One of the better pizza places at the lake.  Try the Proscuitto House pizza -- incredible!  They're all really good.  Wings are just okay.  Great little bar to watch games at and have a great pie and beers!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Ordered chicken tenders for my kids and they were nice enough to dip them into wing sauce. The pizza was really good also!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. I highly recommend it. Friendly staff. I usually do carry out but hope to have some time to dining once"}
{"text":"Awesome wings! Takes about 30 minutes to get food...but worth the wait! Good pizza and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"We've given this place several tries but after our last experience we're done.
I hate to give a bad review but hopefully it will inspire them to make some changes.

First of all it's dark and dingy and could use a good cleaning and some updating. I wouldn't mind the atmosphere so much if the service and food was good, but it's not.

My daughter's side salad that came with her meal had rotten tomatoes and dried up olives. She had to spit out the tomatoes because they tasted so awful. She pushed the salad aside, barely touched. When the waitress came by she asked if we were done with the salad, never asking if anything was wrong since it was clearly not eaten. She never once came by to check on us after she dropped off the entrees. The rest of our dinner was barely edible. Maybe it was an off night? We didn't get pizza so maybe that's their thing and customers should just stick to that. The service there is always a bit off and uncomfortable, except for the friendly host & hostess who greeted us."}
{"text":"Reading the negative reviews, I didn't have high hopes.  But I had a Groupon so I figured why not.

The staff was extremely friendly and attentive...waiter (Jim) was awesome.
The food was SO good.  Buffalo waffle fries...amazing.  Cheesesteak pizza...amazing.

Appetizer came in five minutes...drinks kept getting refilled.  Joel was out talking with customers.

A five star experience.

Assuming the negative reviews are true, they obviously helped this business learn from mistakes, because the place is awesome and we'll be back for sure.

Oh, and the waffle fries were huge.  I might go back just for them."}
{"text":"Just passing through the area & thought this place would be a good place for my husband to see part of he college football game. Unfortunately, I was horribly wrong. First, staff seemed to be too preoccupied to seat us. Not a big deal, brushed it off. Didn't get any info about any specials. Maybe there weren't any, that's okay. Then I  got my pasta dish, forgive me forgetting its name because it was nasty! It was in a \"white wine sauce,\" I  don't know what kind of wine they use but it tasted like rancid grape juice & dish water.  I never complain about food, but that was inedible. When I  let the waitress know I would not eat it & why, she got angry. She rush me & my family out of there so fast my husband & daughter had to box up their 1/3 food. Never will I  recommend this place."}
{"text":"The ranch was almost like water and their chicken  had a very unusual texture to them.  Hate to write bad reviews but they need to fix some things."}
{"text":"The Best Pizza place around! No other place gets the pizza just right and crispy all along the bottom of the pie! The only problem here is deciding to go with the Deluxe Pizza, the amazing wings or some of the best sub around... First World issues :-)  We just moved from New Hampshire and it's amazing to find a wicked good place with wicked good food!"}
{"text":"That's incorrect Joel.  Yes, we did ask about an expired groupon.  Unlike other small businesses, you declined to honor it.  I have no problem with that.  Its your choice to make.  So we used another coupon.  At that point, we were accused of trying to use multiple coupons.  Incorrectly accused at that.  Rude and condescending.   Get the facts before you accuse.  (I'm starting to sense a theme from you guys). The manager was then asked back to the table because we were charged for items we didn't order.   The manager came to the table three times, not five.  One to answer my question about the groupon, a second to inaccurately accuse me of trying to use two coupons and a third to fix the bill that you guys messed up.  Again Joel, please get the facts prior to making accusatory comments.   I'm fine with an off night.   We all have those.   Being treated disrespectfully, is entirely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Buyer beware: I'll start by saying the food is excellent and I would definitely recommend it. However, the hidden and/or fine print fails to provide an open disclosure of an 18% automatic gratuity. This gratuity is automatically applied upon the following: groups of 6 or more, use of a coupon, and use of a Groupon. Unfortunately, due to the lack of transparency, this Groupon purchaser will no longer be dining at Prosciuttos. Atmosphere and experience are as just as important as the quality of food when choosing a dining establishment. However, this experience left this customer with a bad taste in their mouth. The 18% undisclosed gratuity is unfortunate, as this diners tipping gesture generally resides with-in a minimum of 20%-30%."}
{"text":"My husband and I bought a groupon to check out this restaurant because we live in the lake area. 

I think that this place needs a lot of  improvement. The restaurant itself is old, dark, and dingy inside. It needs a good clean and a decorating facelift to make it feel more clean and presentable. I understand that it has a \"Cheers\" vibe, but it's dark and there is a lingering smell in the restaurant (like years of grease and a lack of cleaning). The overall experience could be much better. 

The pizza and wings tasted good, but they were too greasy. Like dripping in grease. The prices are way too high for the food at this bar-styled restaurant. Even with our groupon, we paid a lot for pizza and wings. 

The servers are kind and look like they have been there for a while, as loyal employees. This was the only highlight of our experience. 

With all of the other options around the lake, we won't be back until they deep clean and renovate this old establishment. There's always room for improvement and I hope they take the opportunity."}
{"text":"As wing freaks originally from NY (don't hold it against us), we want big, flavorful and extra crispy with blue cheese and not ranch. Prosciutto's did not disappoint!! House sauce was fantastic and home made blue cheese will have us coming back for more. 

Side salad with home made Italian dressing accompanied eggplant parmigiana was also ordered, along with a Boston style cheesesteak pizza. Everything was fresh and perfect. 

Service was friendly and always willing to refill drinks promptly. Wish we didn't have to travel 77 to get there, but it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"hapened to pass by this place between lunch & dinner. place was almost empty and we ordered a pizza and steak hero. The pizza was EXCELLENT! As good as Luigis in S Charlotte. Very NY style-crisp crust with lots of cheese and good tasting sauce. The hero was ery good also. Try it for pizza-be prepared to put up with all their Red Sox stuff."}
{"text":"It's Like being in New England!!!  The same Pizza I grew up enjoying.  Great service Great Food !! Go on in and meet the owners Joel & Kelly and you will feel you knew them your whole life. go on Monday's for there wing special you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Restaurant owner's partial response to our family's bad experience (copied and pasted from my Inbox, only he didn't use asterisks):

\"You really are a f*cking moron arent you?  You just don't get it do you?  How about you use math.. oh wait.. might be too complex for you... Go f*ck off.  You are a f*cking moron.  And you can tell everyone you know what I said.  I'm sure they will consider the source.\" 

Classy response to a customer complaint.  I don't need to tell everyone I know what you said...you just did with your own words.  Others can decide if they want to take their family into a place like this, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. Delivery guy said he left our dessert in the car and would go get it and bring it in. In good faith, we paid and tipped. The guy left and never returned with the dessert we bought.

Joel, it was May 24 around 9:45pm delivered to Homewood Suites in Davidson in the bar area. We ordered a large cheese pizza, large vege pizza and chocolate cake. The driver was a young, white male."}
{"text":"Went with friends they recommended they had good wings..  I have had take out pizza from here and it is ok.  I ordered Honey habanero wings.  I told the waitress I wanted them crispy.  Well she should have told me they already come crispy.  The wings were salty and dry and overdone, with no honey flavor to be found.  These are some of the worst wings I have ever had.  I paid $15 tax and tip for 10 dry horrible wings and a beer.  No celery or carrots included unless you pay additional.  First time I order wings that don't include celery and carrots.  Won't be going back at least not for wings.  Also dinner took a very long time to come out for a sandwich and two orders of wings. No thank you. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Zucchini Sticks are certainly worth it. Friendly staff and good service.  Hot Italian Sub was indeed spicy and packed with a wide assortment of meats.  Beverage carbonation calibration was spot on for both the Sierra Mist and the Root Beer. Televisions were at good angles for proper viewing of sporting events.  Price was moderate, but I still think worth it."}
{"text":"Regarding the lovely review written by one \"G.E.\" below...I don't have kids and therefore they didn't run free."}
{"text":"This place has gone WAY downhill over the years. Used to have the best food aropund, now average at best.  On my last (as in I won't be back) visit they messed up every single part of my order. How hard is it to read a ticket in the kitchen?  The owner, Joel, was rude and uncaring, so he won't see another dime from me! (Had been going every month or so for a couple years).
DEFINITELY try Brooklyn South or Sabatino's, both close by with way better and consistent food, at better prices too."}
{"text":"This is typically our first choice for pizza and wings delivery. We ordered right around 7:10pm and was told delivery will be in about 45 minutes. An 8pm dinner may be a little late, but still reasonable. Well, it's been an hour and half and still not here. It'll be interesting how that pizza looks by the time it gets here. If it looks fresh, maybe they get an additional star.

Worse part, I called to follow up and the person who answered said\"It is out for delivery and will be there soon.\" Hangry as I am, I asked what time should we expect it since it's almost 9pm and she said \"I have no idea\". Clearly no clue how to appease an irate customer. Not even an apology. 

Prosciutto's pizza- you just lost a valued customer."}
{"text":"Great food and service from Steph!  Wonderful place for kids - nice play corner with toys.  Good beer selection.  Trivia is fun too!"}
{"text":"Order to go...

Sampler Platter:
Cheese Sticks - Excellent
Zucchini Sticks - Ok, not the best
Ravioli - Terrible

Cheese Pizza:
- I give them credit to extra cheese, that was right on!
- Over all a disappointment! 
- Corn meal bottom, it made a mess everywhere & I'm not a fan of the texture. 
(Better then domino's, but not even close to Brooklyn south pizza."}
{"text":"Well, I stopped in with the family just to have a snack. We just had some wings which were very meaty and very fresh. But as I was reading the menu I saw the worlds most spicy wing! And you need to sign a waiver form and everything so you won't sue! Insane right? I thought it was a joke or a sales pitch. The nice lady said it sent 4 people to the hospital. If you can eat 6 the meal is free and you get a shirt. Personally I can take spice so I decided to try one for 1.99

First they bring out gloves so you don't burn your hands and warn you not to rub your eyes. Again I'm thinking this is funny. So the guy comes out looking like he got hit by a truck with this wing on a special plate and a bottle of milk. Again thinking this is funny.

Now , I can handle spice and I can pretty much do any level. I must say I did one bite and my whole entire face turned red and my mouth and lips were burning for 1hr! Off one bite! I could have eaten one but it would have just made my stomach sick from the acid. But if you are feeling daring or want to try something wild. Give it a shot. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I stopped into tonight and had dinner on a suggestion from some friends. As a warning to NYers who go here this bar/restaurant is owned by a guy from Boston so its decked out in SOX and Pats gear, I have warned you proceed with caution but This place hit its mark on everything, first we went pretty early I work nights so I tend to eat really early. SO it was like 430 when we got in there we were the only people there at the time other some random guy at the bar drinking water on his phone. So we sat at the bar we are bar sitters you get better service at the bar I think. So were greeted pretty quickly by the server/bartender she took our drink orders they had a decent selection of craft beer to chose from and my wife took the bartenders suggeston on the wine and she really liked it. SO we ordered we were just going to do a small pizza and share a pasta but decided we were going to be fat kids and got the pizza pasta and a sandwich. Yup we destroyed all of it we are fat kids so sue me. Any pizza was good thin crust and tiny pieces but it was also only at 8\" pie( I am from NY ITS A PIE don't like it don't read it). this would have a been a good appetizer for like 2 maybe three people if there were toppings other then cheese. I ordered the spicy Italian and it was awesome, I haven't had a good deli style sandwich since moving down here again I am from NY so  Deli is important to me and don't comment you should try Firehouse subs or Jimmy Johns they are not delis. The sand was toasty with Hot cappy and pepperoni and ham and they had the best thing ever they had the hot pepper sandwich topping, plus banana peppers. YEA I WAS IN  HEAVEN OR AT least could have died and wen tthere with that sandwich. My wife had the pasta I don't remember the actual menu name but it was penne with alfredo sauce and broccoli. the alfredo sauce was really good not to salty and not bland. So food 5 stars and the staff was very good we met the other bartender Sully and sat talked with him for like 45 minutes on the area where live and about being transplants from up north."}
{"text":"Ate there last night under protest, due to past experiences which were awful. I can say the food was good although my pasta dish did not have much chicken in it. I kept fishing around in the sauce but could only find three small chunks. The restaurant was not busy and our service was great, much to my surprise. The place still smells like old fryer oil and looks dingy."}
{"text":"We visited Prosciutto's today for lunch.  First time visitors.  It wasn't very busy in there, but it took a long time for our pizza to come.  Other than the large table of loud annoying children next to us, the large garden salad was good, and so was the pizza.  We warmed the pizza up at home tonight for dinner and it was even better warmed up.  The wait staff was very nice and we would come back for pizza and maybe try some pasta."}
{"text":"We go to Prosciutto's a couple times a year to watch football. If this review was based solely on food it would get more stars, but there service could be much better and faster. It is not horrible service but they could work on it a little bit. It may not be the server's themselves they may just need some help. Two servers for a busy restaurant just is not enough. They would actually benefit from more servers as people would get drinks faster and they would drink more obviously. Most of there food is typical bar food that is nothing to write home about but there pizza and wings are delicious. There pizza is one of the best in the lake hands down and the wings are up there as well. The wings are not as good as Al's but they are good. Probably top five wings around the lake."}
{"text":"As a RI and New Englander native, this place is awesome and will become my go to for New England sports. It's got a great vibe to it with New England memorabilia decorating the inside. They have an outside area with bar stools and a tv too for this beautiful NC weather.

The food is very good. We tried pizza, pasta, calzones and wings so really feel like we got a great idea of the mix. One of my favorite parts is that they make their own dressings and sauces in house - this is always impressive to me. The housemade ranch and blue cheese are both delicious. Love the wings too, especially the garlic parm and the honey habernero. The make your own pizza option is great, though the toppings are a big expensive. They do beer specials on Sundays (Sam Adams) so definitely will be my new hang out!"}
{"text":"1st time in was good.  Ordered 2 pies and an order of wings, hot.  Wings were done nicely and the sauce tasted purchased but was still good.  A week later we decided to order a pizza.  Still good.  A few weeks later decided to order wings and pizza(take out)... this is where is goes to zero stars.  I ordered one pizza and 10 wings hot.  When I arrive I'm told the wings aren't done, not a problem I figured my order was just behind some others.  20 minutes later the \"head cook\" who is absolutely digusting looking brings walks out from the back with a box of wings and grabs a pizza off the top of their oven.  This is when it sinks in that tonight is cold pizza night.  When I get home not only is the pizza cold, its made wrong.. huge deal? No but I'm getting irritated.  Their extra toppings are somewhat pricey so that adds to the disappointment.   So let's have some wings.... open the box and WHALA!  No sauce of any sort.  Just some ground pepper and pepper flake.  

With that I had enough, called to make my complaint.   Of course thr girl who answers sounds confused so she gives me a \"manager\" who tells me that I'm wrong... no shit the idiot has enough nuts to tell me I'm wrong.  He said he needed to speak to his head cook which was comical.  After a minute or so another \"manager\" comes on the phone to ask wjat he can do.  No other way around this but a refund pal.  The food wasn't right, cold, verge of gross( 3/4 went in the trash) and now that I've seen how and who prepares  the food we won't be back.

From decent to gross in less than a month."}
{"text":"Ordered To-Go. Garlic Knots and a Mini Pepperoni Pizza. I eat here frequently. But this is the 2nd order back to back that has been wrong. I got a cheese pizza instead of pepperoni, and of course was charged extra for the pepperoni; the knots were over cooked. I walked in to pick up and there were 2 customers in front of me. I waited patiently as they were busy on a Friday. Another customer walked in behind me. No one acknowleged me, served the last guest to walk in, then helped me. I have always enjoyed this place, but we are 2 for 2 now."}
{"text":"om nom... 

Ordered delivery for a couple of sandwiches and wings.  

Wings - REALLY good... not too spicy hot, but had a bit of spark - def going hotter next time, but we like hot.

Sandwiches - Chicken Parm & Steak Bomb.  Both very good - crispy bread, very good flavors.

Fries & O-Rings - meh... going with chips next time.  Hard to get delivery of fried foods hot and fresh though.

Leftovers - all of it reheated very well; 350 degrees for about 50 minutes in the toaster over."}
{"text":"Went there for $5 wings day ( Mondays and Tuesdays).  10 wings for $5.  Loved the wings with Thai chili sauce.  Great service! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Definitely our \"go too\" restaurant.  Great food, service, and we love the laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend. Not mad or anything just lacked any real flavor, very bland. I'm not a picky eater at all but the food just did nothing for me. Grilled chicken topping was very poor."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us but I'm not sure why. The pizza was really expensive, tasteless, and when my daughter picked up the first  piece, the crust came out but all the cheese and toppings slid off into the box. We will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Seriously best steak and cheese sub around!  Get it with onion and mushrooms and mayo and what a delicious heart clogger. We spilt the dish it's so large and add a side salad to share as well. I mean doesn't the salad make it all ok ;)

Pizza is also very good but doesn't travel well since it's very thin crust. We tried getting it to go and it was cardboard by the time we got home. We've had it fresh there and it was quite tasty. The pepperoni they use is also very very spicy (I love it but the kids think it's too hot)."}
{"text":"Solid Italian food and great prices.  We stopped in here after golf on a Saturday and the place was packed which is a good sign.  I had the tortellini which had copious amounts of prosciutto. I tried my friend's calzone which was damn good.  My other friend ordered a pizza and it looked solid.  He said it was damn good also. Nothing soggy looking about that pizza.  If I am in the area I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food, crummy service. The older woman who works there should be a drill sergeant instead of a server; she has no business dealing with the public. We've overlooked her unfriendliness on too many occasions. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Had to get some take out because I had no car. Said it would take an hour but only about 45 minutes. Fries, garlic knots and pizza. Pizza was okay too much sauce for my liking. But the garlic knots were amazing!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great pizza or wings in Cornelius this is the place.  You have got to try the steak bomb in the pocket bread. It is one of my favorite sandwiches from anywhere.  Proscuitto's has a great staff, and I always have a good time here."}
{"text":"I like Prosciutto's for many reasons: the pizza is good, the location is nice, its a good place to view the game, and the bartenders and waiters are nice. The chief reason I enjoy this place, though, is the fact that it's non-smoking!

It is so nice to go out, have a beer, eat some food, watch a game or live music, and not leave smelling like an ashtray. 
I've always thought that having smoking 'sections' in an open restaurant is akin to having a peeing section in a pool...it makes no sense when everyone is breathing the same air.

Another feature that makes Prosciutto's a good place is the space. There is a dining area to the left, a large open bar area to the right with hardwood floors and plenty of tables, and tables outside on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Not a Fan of Soggy Pizza

More of a Social gathering place than a place of serious Pizza.  Dined in a couple of times and each time, had a soggy crust.  Granted the topping are more than ample but the bottom of the pizza never gets hot enough or there is too much steam trapped to give anything but a soggy crust.  Sorry but I am not a fan of soggy pizzas.

Service leaves something to be desired.  Once I got seated, it took awhile to get served and once I did, my server disappered and I had to flag her down in the end to get my check.

Atmosphere is OK. It's very good if you're there to Socailize and drink beer but if you're looking for just a good Pizza for Dinner, leaves something to be desired.

I would recommend if for the bar scene if that is what you are looking for."}
{"text":"OMG, their food is amazing. 
So seriously the food is excellent, like so good I bet there isn't any place close to as good within 100 miles.  
Don't miss this one, especially if your hungry, very generous portions."}
{"text":"Horrible food was cold.. Very busy understandably so because short staffed. We ordered two calzones 45 minutes later. Cold. Waitress not at fault. But mgr is slug. Private party going on one side of rest restaurant . Kitchen staff may be short handed. This hadn't been our first time going but grantee this it's our last. Couple we did speak too ordered ravioli said the same thing came out cold sauce was canned. Nothing fresh. Too loud as well."}
{"text":"I used to go here often quite a few years ago. Since I moved away for several years and now back in the Charlotte area I have not found better tortellini. It's superb! The toasted ravioli is a great way to start your meal. The staff is friendly and the food is yummy!!"}
{"text":"I had an overall great pizza from Prosciutto's. I ordered for delivery and it was fast and still hot. Would definitely recommend over the generic pizza chains!"}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's favorite place....the pizza is crisp & tasty, our favorite is the taco pizza.  Has a New England bar atmosphere but also has a family friendly vibe.  Their cannolis are aaammaaazzziinnnngggg."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza place in North Charlotte and within the Lake Norman area.  The staff is awesome and the food is equally good.  They try to have some the best seasonal beers on tap!  What they don't have on tap they might have in cans.  Good for family night out as well.  Give it a try and I think you will like it."}
{"text":"I was having dinner last fall at another restaurant and the couple next to us recommended this place to watch football and get pizzas.  At this point I have now been there a bunch of times, and I've tried most of the menu items.  I don't have kids, but if I did, they have a whole separate side of the place with game machines, etc to entertain them.  Mostly I like to go watch games there, or stop in randomly during the week for a big salad with buffalo tenders... and they also have some REALLY hot sauces if you ask for them!  The pizzas are great, but lately I've been going for the Italian pastas and the salads, etc.

A few months ago, I took my wife there to a \"wine pairing dinner\" with a special menu and paired wines included.  It was amazing food & wine (wouldn't have expected that thing at a pizza place).

During the winter they had some great live music.  Not sure if that's a regular thing (haven't seen any for a while).  Lookin forward to March Madness there.  Over-all great place and fun times!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my boys for years and have never been disappointed. Great food, great service and fun atmosphere.  We pass multiple pizza restaurants just to come here."}
{"text":"Fun, Friendly and Fantastic Food. We stopped in while on vacation and were just looking for a place to get a good warm meal. Well surprise surprise is was very good. My daughter wanted to try the calzone and the waitress suggested adding ricotta to the pie.... Wow! 

The Garlic knots were something we had never experienced and they will be added to our list of really great things. 

My other daughter ordered a sandwich that was surprising as well. The Philly steak was a peppery spicy mixture of goodness. 

We were on the way to a party so we asked if we could order a tray of sandwiches off the catering menu to go with us and they recommended a tray of sandwich wraps. These wraps were very simple and very good. They were the hit of the party."}
{"text":"Best Italian food. Wonderful staff. You feel like family when you are there. Fantastic place to watch your favorite Boston team place. I drive from Charlotte just to eat & drink at Prosciutto's. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I visited for lunch this week with a coworker, after reading that this place was supposedly voted best pizza in Charlotte (despite being in Huntersville?).  I ordered an 8\" NY style pizza, my coworker ordered a Cheeseburger.  After about 20 minutes of waiting, our waitress came up and explained that they were out of \"fresh\" meat, and that he could either have frozen patties usually reserved for cheeseburger subs, or he could just eat a frozen pattied burger.

I have never heard anything like this before, but it's almost par for the course considering the way people act in Cornelius.  He decided on the same 8\" pizza (keep in mind, mine should have been put in the oven 20 minutes ago), and we ended up waiting another 25 minutes to get two 8\" pizzas.

The pizza may have been good (I'm not going to say great.  You cannot get a great pizza in this area - it doesn't exist), and crispy (without being burnt) as others have commented, but the wait time, as well as the strange question, and the fact that after delivering our food, we never saw our waitress again until we tried to get our checks from her; all these stack up against what could have been a great experience.

I can understand holding one person's food back to deliver both plates at the same time, but it does not take that long to cook an 8\" pizza.  I asked my coworker if they'd outsourced their pizza making, when I looked at the clock and realized we'd been there 35 minutes without being served (in a restaurant with approx. 4 other tables of people).

Both managers were sitting 5 feet away (on their laptops, btw - I couldn't help but wonder if they were going over reviews... but if they had been, they would've been at our table trying to make it up).  Neither manager offered an apology or refund to us for this obviously bad experience, which would've swayed me to review higher, and/or consider giving them one more chance.  I was close to pointing out everything that went wrong to the manager, but I just wanted to get out of there by the time we were done eating.  From now on, I won't let the issue rest, because eating is expensive in Cornelius, and you should always have a good experience.  The staff here *caused* the bad experience from the moment we walked in."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza for carryout.  The staff was friendly and quickly had the order ready to go when I arrived to pick it up. Unfortunately, the pizza itself was mediocre. All three of us eating agreed- 4/10 stars. We may give Prosciutto's another try, but we will not be ordering their pizza."}
{"text":"Ok so Proscuttos Pizza is the place to go if you want good \"northern\" style pizza!  This pizza is thin and just plain great!  

My husband and I love the 5 Cheese pizza w the slices sausage and red peppers ( any of them are honestly good but this kind has my heart)!  

Not only have we eaten the pizza but the wings are outstanding!  They are crispy with a lot of sauce!  My favorite is Parmesan Garlic!!!  Pasta is great as well as the calzones!!!  

Honestly best pizza in the northern part of Charlotte!  I'm from Pittsburgh and don't do chain pizza so I love love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for my dinner break at work because it came highly recommended. Needless to say it did not disappoint.  

I had 10 wings (Monday and Tuesday they are the special, 10 wings for $5) and I small pepperoni pizza.

The wings were excellent! The were big juicy and had great flavor!  I had the garlic Parmesan ones.  Only bad thing is you can't get 2 flavor a when they are on special. 

The pepperoni pizza was good as well.  Came out fresh and hot with a crispy crust! I could taste that they use fresh ingredients in it as well.

I was going to give them 4 stars because they are a New England bar; catch every Patriots game there on Sundays.  But I'm not that petty

So if you are in the Cornelius area and want some good food head here for it as well as their full bar!"}
{"text":"For $16 ($20 with a tip), a friend and I feasted gloriously on some really good pizza. We at a whole large - it was that good. It's that delightful, slippery, greasy kind of pizza like you get in New York, where the cheese is just kind of floating around on a grease-sauce nexus. 

The decor was totally for dudes. If you are into watching games, it would be a good place to watch games. If you are not into watching games, but you are forced to be with people who want to watch games, it would be a tolerable place to endure that kind of experience. At least you could glory in the cheese-sauce-grease nexus.

The waiters were really attentive and nice without being annoying. I am working not too far from here, so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"We met friends here last night. We were very happy with the service, the food and the drinks. We ordered 10 old bay wings, 10 hot wings, a large cheese pizza, a large pepperoni pizza and two large salads (Caesar and ranch). Loved the homemade ranch. Perfect wings and pizza night. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Baked ziti is the best pasta dish I have ever had at any restaurant. The restaurant tends to be very loud and prices are a bit steep. It is a great place to watch Patriots football, as it is a Patriots bar, so there is always a good turnout and many tvs."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant. Fabulous pizza and pasta dishes. We've been regulars for 7 years, they make us feel like one of the family!"}
{"text":"Nice place in a cute little area. Clean and well decorated in Boston sports decor. A good selection of food and drinks (along with some tasty local brews). Had drink specials. Staff was fast, efficient, and pleasant. I'd definitely go again"}
{"text":"My boyfriend liked the pasta, the buffalo tenders made my stomach hurt. 

However the fries were good. 
One server working, but she was nice.

Okay place, but probably won't return."}
{"text":"This place was great! Our table all ordered pastas and loved them. The chicken parm was the best I've ever had. The single portion is massive and could easily be split between two people. The large order is humongous but worth it for leftovers. It took nearly an hour from getting seated to getting our food, but it was all so good once we got it that it didn't seem to matter. Just be prepared to wait for pasta.The salads that came with the meals were also pretty large. Overall, would definitely recommend this place for some great, filling pasta. Next time would love to check out the pizzas as those looked great as well."}
{"text":"Food is inconsistent... sometimes it's good, sometimes not so much. Won't be back because of the service, a woman working there was very rude and acted like my business was an inconvenience. I believe her name was Summer."}
{"text":"We stopped in Cornelius overnight on our way back to Pittsburgh from Florida and all I can say is wow! This place was delicious! My fiancé and I both ordered pasta; I got tortellinis with tomato cream sauce and he got chicken parm. My tortellinis were tasty and you could tell that the sauce was homemade. I got the small and it was still huge! My fiancé also loved the chicken parm. We also got the house white pizza which my fiancé really enjoyed. The garlic knots are to die for - a MUST order! We had the food delivered to a hotel and they brought plates, silverware, Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper packets without us requesting them. Amazing customer service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Prosciutto's Pizza! My favorite pizza is the Prosciutto's House. It is an olive oil and garlic based pizza topped with prosciutto, mozzarella, and feta cheese, and I always add black olives and mushrooms. Sooooo good! As far as appetizers go, the garlic knots are awesome, soaked in butter and fresh garlic. Great atmosphere, too! Plenty of beer to choose from as well, with a variety of Sam Adams on draft. Check it out! Don't just take my word for it! :)"}
{"text":"There aren't too many good local places in the Charlotte area but this place is the bomb! As a Patriots fan I loved the decor but the food was the real MVP. On Monday's and Tuesday's they have 10 wings for $5 and you sure do get your money's worth, the wings are HUGE and better quality than any \"wing place\". Since they were only $5 for 10 we got 2 orders so we could try 2 flavors(can't split flavors on special night, not sure about other nights), we tried the Thai chili and the house. The house was so different from anything I've ever tried, they're combo of 4 different flavors and they were spectacular. I'm not a huge wing person and it's not often I'm impressed with wings, so that says something. However, my fiancé on the other hand is a damn wing connoisseur and he said the house were the best wings he's ever had. Also they make all their dressings and the ranch is top notch. We also got a small house pizza (don't judge us, we didn't finish it or the wings). It has an olive oil base with feta, mozzarella, and of course prosciutto. Needless to say we will definitely be retuning and have cut ties with other wing places lol! Great food, awesome prices and lots of left overs for tomorrow, what's not to like about this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's on the pricier side of pizza joints, but they taste so good!  I got some wings last night and I wanted to eat THE BONES.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Had to feed 8 very hungry teens.  Had to think fast.  Yelped this place and got take out.  We had a gluten free person and they had an option for her.  She loved it.  We ate Hawaiin, BBQ Chicken, and a Pepperoni pizza.  I was glad to see that the kids kind of ignored the Chicken BBQ pizza as that worked great for the 5 adults that were eating.  No complaints from 8 kids or any adults.  Great pizza.  Will be back next time I am in Mooresville."}
{"text":"I grew up in Boston so I'm a bit biased - at least by the decor (Red Sox, Celtics and Patriots). But it only adds to a great place - regardless of hometown. Awesome pizza. Great service. Comfortable. Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I moved from Palm Harbor Fl and was not sure if I could find as wonderful restuarants as I did in Florida. I was surprised to find this not so decorated Italian restuarant to be soo delicious! I had the simple but favorite Spaghetti and Meatblls. Very large portion, hot flavor able with 2 moist well done meatballs. Comes with your choice of cold, fresh side salad a very nice size as well. I was stuffed!! Can not wait to try their many styles and flavors of Pizza. Yum! Pictures online are very true to what you receive."}
{"text":"Prosciutto's Pizza is easy to miss because it's tucked away in a strip center off Torrence Chapel Rd but definitely worth seeking out.  We go for pizza and wings all the time and are never disappointed.  The wait staff is always so friendly and on top of things.  Put this on your list of pizza places to try if you haven't already!!  We live in Denver and the pizza place around the corner from us is TERRIBLE.  We drive to Cornelius any time we want a good slice!"}
{"text":"Been here three times. First time was many years ago, and the pizza was really good! That was actually a takeout experience. The last two times I visited was because my kid's sports teams were having end-of-year celebrations there. The place definitely needs an upgrade, but it's still good for kids because they have arcade games and TVs. Another positive is the wait staff. They were very friendly on both occasions. On the negative side, the pizza isn't as good as it used to be. It's not bad, but it's not great. And the review about the owner cursing at a diner really makes me have no interest in returning. Generous rating."}
{"text":"I decided to try Prosciutto's Pizza after receiving a coupon in my marriage mail (postal employee speak for junk mail). The flyer stated that their pizza was voted \"Best Pizza in Charlotte\". With that claim I had to try it (though it didn't hurt that the flyer also came w/ a coupon for a free dine-in 12-inch cheese pizza). 

Atmosphere - Strip mall location, surprising old bar feel on the inside, Massachusetts 'massxxxx' memorabilia everywhere!, spacious, dark, busy. 

Service - Despite being rather busy, service was friendly and quick. I opted for a booth that was cheerfully cleaned. I picked this spot so I could sit as far away as possible from the numerous Brady/ Patriots items that litter the establishment. 

Food - I had the pizza. I must say this pizza took me back to the Northeast, as the crust was thin, flexible, and had a slight crunch to it. I also liked that it was dusted with cornmeal. The sauce was neither sweet nor spicy. It was kind of in between. The toppings were all fresh...i.e. the mushrooms were not from a can. The black olives were a little disappointing but not uncommon from a place of this ilk. The next time I will skip that topping. 

Price - Backing out the discount, a 12-inch pizza w/ three toppings was $12.75 and the drink was $1.99. A little pricey, but not too bad. 

Overall - This place took me back ever so briefly to the NE for some tasty pizza. I am just deducting 1 star for the place being so in love with the Pats. 

Go Steelers!!!"}
{"text":"If I was rating just the food,  I'd give them 4 stars,  but this is the full package.   Service sucks... They're so slow.   Pizza doesn't take 35+ minutes to make and cook.   Don't even order the wings....  You might as well get them to go.  The waiter didn't seem to care about us that much.  He stopped at our table 4 times,  and that includes taking our order and the check.   He walked by a number of times and didn't stop to see how we were doing or pick up dirty dishes.... Yes we had dirty dishes from the salad and garlic knots that took 20 minutes.   Salad took 20 minutes....  Nothing to cook and it it took 20 minutes.  The pizza is good,  but the service sucks.   They do deliver so you Cid go that route,  but they only go 5 miles;  I live 5.6 miles away and they tell me no.   Can't go the extra 0.6 miles...  I think I'm done with this place.   The food is good,  but not that good."}
{"text":"My brother and his family have been here and took us the other night.

It was relatively crowded with a private party to the left but we were seated to the right in the main dining area.

Seems like a good place to watch sports with a small group.  We all got pizza and the wings were tasty.  I wouldn't say the pizza was anything life changing but the service was good.  Everyone was friendly and polite, things I take for granted surrounded by a-holes in Los Angeles.

Typically we go to Brickhouse in Davidson but this restaurant seems like a nice family owned establishment so I'd go again next time I am visiting my brother and his family."}
{"text":"I'm what you would call a pizza Connoisseur. I could live off it, and I really only write reviews on pizza places. I've been here a few times only because they are right across the street from work.  This pizza is just not that good. They are really not good at making dough - the Sauce and cheese combination is not bad, but the dough is what ruins the pizza. The dough is not what you would ever see at any great pizza place in NY (I've been everywhere).  

I went again today and tried a Calzone. Don't try their Calzones.

As convenient as this place is, I will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"Very good. We went in for hero's and i loved mine. We shared two and split them I had the eggplant and my husband had the meatball one. I thought it was very tasty. the pasta salad coul have been a little less aldente but it was ok.  They have a wing special and I think I might go back for that. Its tucked away and hard to find but you will remember it. They had a kids party there while we visited and they seemed to have a blast"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Got grilled chicken that was clearly reheated in the microwave.  Just gross.  The place is dirty and the food isn't good.  Pass on this place."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Definitely not the best wings/pizza I've had in the area, but tolerable. We got take out from there a couple weeks ago. The girl that took our order repeated the CORRECT order back to us. After we picked it up and brought it home it was completely wrong. We asked for grilled chicken on a salad, we got fried. Instead of blue cheese we got ranch. On our buffalo chicken hoagie we asked for just lettuce and blue cheese. All the hoagie had had on it was the buffalo chicken. Like I said the food is OK, but not worth paying for something that isn't what you ordered."}
{"text":"I've ordered out enough from this place, they deserve my review! Some of the best wings I've had around Charlotte, big, well-cooked, and their house sauce is awesome. The house pizza is great too, their crust is corn-meal bottom, which is better without marinara base to me. Big fan of his place, and their delivery guy was always friendly to the household of roommates constantly ordering from them!"}
{"text":"I've actually never eaten in the restaurant but, have gotten enough takeout pizza  to make some commentary on the quality of that food and the service at the counter when picking it up.

I actually am a fan of the pizza overall but, it's in a change of pace kind of way.  I wouldn't put it on any list of best pizza in Charlotte or even on my own personal best of list but, I do find myself craving Prosciutto's pizza about once a quarter.  When I order pizza it is almost always topped with pepperoni, ground beef (or meatball) and onions.  My favorite thing on the pizza from here is the ground beef.  It's actually big hunks of ground beef scattered over the pie vs. those rabbit pellet looking things that show up in the Pizza Hut delivery dudes bag.  The crust is not my favorite in that it's not thin enough for me but, it tastes good and crisps up nicely on my pizza stone once i get it home.

From a service perspective, lets just say I hear you to the people who have some less than stellar comments on the dine-in service.  Not sure what it is but, most of the folks who have gotten my pizza and taken my cash are just not that friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place!  First experience was with my parents a few years back during a visit.  They raved about the pizza and Boston vibe and since moving here it's a to go spot for my family 
The pizza is fabulous and the prosciutto salad is a must try 
They have flights of beers so you can sample some new varieties which I love as well 
Staff is friendly and look like they enjoy their jobs which is a huge plus for me"}
