{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. I love burritos and since it was on the way, i decided to stop and try. I ordered butter chicken burrito which tasted good. The low rating was that for the price of almost 7 dollars, i was hoping to get a bit more chicken. Staff was friendly which was a plus."}
{"text":"Size, taste and price point are all bad for this specific branch. I have not tried another and I probably won't bother.

Ordered a large chicken burrito here. Received (and I kid you not), almost half the size of \"Burritoboyz small burrito\".

The burrito sauce did not have a distinct taste. I usually skip on the cheese and ask for extra burrito sauce, which didn't make a difference.

I thought I would test this place though a Groupon but even that I cannot recommend. Burritoboyz, mucho burrito, Chipotle are far superior than this place."}
{"text":"This location probably lost me and my friends as a customer forever.

I think the franchisee at this location are ruining the potential good name for a Mexican joint. After experiencing terrible customer service twice, despite being a regular, I am never stepping back at this location ever again. 

I usually get a vegetarian burrito and my friends opt for the grilled chicken one. Many times they complained they were served a burrito with barely any meat in it but I didn't take them seriously. 

This time around, two things ticked me off.

1) The cheese was finished, only powdery stuff left in the bin, and the lady making the burrito (who is the franchisee relative) didn't bother getting more cheese and used the powdery left over on the burrito.

2) Keeping my calm, I waited patiently, realizing she hadn't put any grilled vegetables on the burrito. So I asked her about it, and that's when she bothered to tell me they were out of vegetables. Gee if only she would've mention that tiny point when I placed my order she could've saved us a ton of time. 

I asked her if the burrito is on a discounted price since it's missing the key ingredient...the saut√©ed vegetables. Nope, nothing at all. Pathetic customer service. All she said \"do you still want burrito?\"

Of course I don't want a half empty burrito! So ridiculous and unbelievable. The lack of responsibility towards her customers or even a meagre effort to make customers happy was appalling. She didn't care at all what was in the burrito, all she cared about was the money. Absolute cheapskates, a fast food restaurant shouldn't have to feel like dealing with a scam artist."}
{"text":"Had a veggie burrito+ drink with their special. It could have been better seasoned since it was lacking flavour but overall not bad, I would go again!!"}
{"text":"I once tried ordering delivery from this place. I called and placed my order. They called back a couple minutes later to ask whether I wanted sour cream on the side or in the burrito. I told them no sour cream in the burrito please. After this conversation, I had waited over an hour to get my food but it had never arrived. I called up the restaurant and they said I had called and cancelled my order. When I told them only they had contacted me, they were extremely rude about it and started yelling at me saying how I am a liar.

I decided to give them one more try. This time, I decided to go to the restaurant to place my order in order to have no confusion. However, the place reeked of body odour. It was pretty bad that I did not want to order from them at all. I would strongly recommend people to not come to this establishment."}
{"text":"I had to try it for myself, came in at 10:45pm after my workout and wanted something to eat. Read the reviews before coming here and it wasn't too pleasant... But when i got there, the server explained everything and suggested the chicken tanga ? Aka the spicy chicken burrito. Anyways, got my burrito and filled it with all the toppings. It wasn't bad tbh, i was kind of skeptical about the place reading the reviews but it didn't turn out that bad.... Maybe the veggies were a little cold but overall it was decent. Would definitely come back for another post-workout meal."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. My first time trying this and it was a terrible experience. The staff did not know where any of their products were and constantly had to keep going to the back to check. Most of their meats were not made and they don't have \"soya patties\" as advertised on their website. The overall burrito was sloppy and it took them 20+ minutes to cash me out. The whole staff was very slow paced and confused. They put too much sauce on everything and the veggie burrito I ordered did not taste that great."}
{"text":"Not authentic Mexican but price wise pretty cheap and the food was good! Don't try the jerk sauce (unless u like lemon and pepper mixed). We ate hard shell tacos and quesadillas and we liked it.. Will def recommend."}
{"text":"Came here with an open mind despite mediocre reviews. However its basically a bad Chipotle knock off."}
{"text":"I just ordered a salad bowl and it was horrible. The staff started off asking if I wanted rice and beans, then moved next to protein, which I chose the mild chicken that she suggested. 

Next was onto the toppings of tomato, lettuce, corn and etc. After she was done with the toppings, she moved onto the salsa and sour cream.... And that's pretty much it for this \"salad\"! 

It's not like the Chipotle salad bowl that I'm used to, where it consisted of an actual bed of salad.. But here you simply get a little bit of shredded lettuce. 

I asked for more lettuce and rice which she was happy to provide more. 

The taste of the salad itself wasn't all that bad BUT the chicken was absolutely disgusting. It didn't even taste like chicken. I thought it was some sort of chicken substitute. It's not 100% chicken meat and I will 100% never eat there again!"}
{"text":"Tried this \"Mexican\" restaurant recently, but it was terrible. Probably the worst burrito location I've been to. I'm surprised that they are still open to be honest.

The staff was friendly, but the food was just not good. I ended up just throwing out my food."}
{"text":"Got some wings, non breaded. 
Asked if I could get the sauce on the side which was no issue. Amazing customer service. 

Wings were fall off the bone tender. They were smaller than restaurant wings but they're way bigger than other pizza chains. 

They have a huge selection of sauce flavours which you can have your wings tossed in. I wish they had more dry seasoning flavours though. Make sure to ask which is dry as some flavours that are usually dry seasonings are actually sauces. Luckily I asked ahead of time! (For example lemon pepper is a sauce here) 

The lemon pepper sauce and Cajun seasoning was extremely flavourful. The lemon pepper sauce literally tasted like lemon pepper. I tasted them then tossed them in the box they came in and shook it. Coated the wings nicely. 

One other thing I'd change is the containers they came in. Usually fried food gets soggy when it's in enclosed containers from the steam. Most fried foods are put into a container with air holes to prevent this from happening. Although it wasn't a big deal for me as I ate them right when I got home. If you had them in the containers for a longer time they'd get soggy."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant open up a few months ago, and finally went. Twice. The first experience was excellent.

The staff are very friendly, generous with their portions, and easy to deal with.

Although I only went twice, I never had to wait very long (even during a busy time) to get my order.

And of course the food: it got me to come back twice so far. And many more to come."}
{"text":"Being a fan of chipotle, fiance had picked up a waging for this restaurant. Upon entering the place I noted its very clean and well maintained, the staff was hard working and constantly cleaning during our stay which is good to know.
Food: many unique protein choices that you don't see at your usual burrito places (chicken tinga, butter chicken, chicken mole, jerk chicken) as well as your usual choices. The gentleman serving us was awesome enough to let is sample the different chicken flavours before ordering. We ended up with chicken tinga and mole which were delicious and juicy. One thing to note is the chicken isn't grilled..its.more like a stove cooked stewed version. Not a bad thing but to each their own based on preference..I enjoyed it:)
As noted before they heat up your tortilla before and after. Also the toppings all looked fresh.

Price: well priced, cheaper than Chipotle and servings are huge, they don't cheap out on servings! $6 for a burrito bowl, 5.99 for regular burritos.

We would return to this place again, service was definitely a bonus:)"}
{"text":"I used to love their beef tacos but I think they changed their shells and honestly it's almost inedible now. However their chicken quesadillas are very tasty."}
{"text":"The tortilla was disgusting, my burrito was soggy,  the dude didn't seem like he knew how to make a burrito,  and the beans were cold.  Never going back here again!"}
{"text":"Friday night & it was empty. The food tasted ok, but, it just bothers me very much when the staff that are serving a customer food, start speaking their native language right in front of customers.  
Ordered cheesy fries, very small handful of French fries for $5 +. This was the last time to go."}
{"text":"I read through some of the previous reviews about the pitiful amount of cheese and the size of the burrito and disagree - I had a regular burrito which is a pretty good size and they packed on a lot of ingredients.  

That being said, the quality is sub-par.  The ingredients taste fine but it's not heated up enough so it's just a warm burrito at best.  The hot sauce is nowhere near hot.  They have bottles of hot sauce on the tables which I poured into the burrito with every bite.  

The only redeeming factor is they retained the decor from the previous sandwich deli and is very spacious and clean for a burrito place.  Other than that, it's a mediocre burrito place with an identity crisis - because besides being a burrito place, it apparently has available 50 flavours of wings and serve beer.  I'm all for beer and wings but would not have thought to do so at a place called Burrito Zone."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Ordered from burrito zone for a second time because they left a pretty good first impression. However, after my experiences this time around I don't think I'll be ordering from this joint again. 

Again I ordered through UberEATS, and everything was fine up until I received my food. I was very disappointed with how the food tasted. The shrimp tacos were very bland and tasteless, and the rice in the burrito tasted very soggy and bland as well. The fries I ordered on the side tasted as though they were made from oil that hasn't been changed for like a week. 

I decided to call Burrito Zone to address my disappointment to which the lady who I was speaking to was very rude about it. She told me there was nothing they could do, and proceeded to tell me to call UberEATS for further complaints (which makes no sense at all considering they're the ones who made the food - the Uber driver did nothing wrong but deliver it to me) 

Regardless the phone call did not end well and I will not be ordering from them again. BYE."}
{"text":"I tried the qusdadilla , it was really really goosd. I would recommend trying it !! The owners were fast and really friendly !"}
{"text":"Had dinner here. Staff is extremely slow. At the busiest time they only had one guy working. Feels like they don't speak English and have a terrible attitude. Waited almost 30 minutes in line. When it came to paying, the man couldn't figure out how much change he was giving me. That took another 10 minutes... Only to figure out that he gave me the wrong change. Also got nachos which were cold and I'm pretty sure my beef was microwaved. Waited way too long for bad food!"}
{"text":"VERY unimpressed!!! Both their website and door signage indicate they close at midnight on Saturday evenings. Drove there at 11 pm as I was starving and craving a burrito and it was the closest one to home still open (and pregnancy cravings are no joke!) AND THEY WERE CLOSED. Not cool. Now I'm hangry. Very hangry..."}
{"text":"Small quantity of food for $10.. cheap out on the protein literally 8 small pieces of chicken for the burrito. The size of the burrito is much smaller than Chipotle's and other burrito brands. They do not have all the protein/items listed on their site. Customer service is additionally terrible the lady was rude and in a rush.. even though the store was empty.

Overall wouldnt recommend!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this is in no way an example of Mexican food. 
I ordered a burrito with chicken. The fact that my first 3 and only bites all had chicken cartilage and tendons was not a good start. My burrito had so much sauce that it seemed like I was eating stew (also ordered a steak burrito with no burrito sauce, also stew consistency). I had asked for rice and if they put a respectable amount it may have absorbed some of that soup. I honestly could not bring myself to eat beyond the 3 bites. My coworker, who was testing this place for our next team lunch order, did finish but was as unsatisfied as I was. 
Can't say I'll be giving this menu another chance but hopefully they improve for others. 
This review in no way reflects the staff or restaurant dine in as this was takeout."}
{"text":"Wow, a lot of polarizing reviews for this place! It's really nothing special, but it's not terrible either. The ingredients are pretty much on par with Subway. The meat is certainly pre-cooked and then steamed and some of the veggies such as the corn and jalepenos are canned. The other veggies were fresh enough. I forget the name of the chicken I had; it had some nice taste, but a bit too sweet.

A redeeming quality is that it's quite cheap since the large burrito was about $6. Another plus is that they have beer, and for really cheap as well. The staff (possibly an owner) was super nice too.

You get what you pay for ultimately. You can do a lot worse than this for a meal under $8."}
{"text":"New location noticed as I drove home from work.   Checked yelp and no reviews yet but noticed a Thornhill location had mediocre reviews at best.  

I asked for suggestions and was told they had a burrito special Which I ordered as well as a quesadilla.   I did lose a little trust when I chose whole wheat tortiliia and was told she would check if they were \"defrosted\" yet.  Gasp. 

Selected my toppings and meat and this was served with a few broken tortilla crumbs in the side and no salsa which I found out is a side order extra afterwards.   

Mediocre at best for the food, cold inside although they did it it on a press just not long enough as the cheese was not even warm.   

I was looking forward to this as a goto weekday place but disappointed.  Being the distance is not far I will give this another try hoping it was new staff and disinterested owner being the reason for the issues.   

I do assume disinterested owner or at least manager as I saw them sitting with some friends or business partner at the window booth not very receptive to guests or the 2 dirty tables around him since there was no garbage but forced to leave your tray at your table."}
{"text":"First time here and the atmosphere is very nice. Great for a beer if you are eating a spicy burrito. I like it because there are so many choice to choose. The price is average. I would give a 4 star if the meat was more hot. The sides are great and sauce are many."}
{"text":"Food - quite good. Service - abysmal. Not that it was non existent but that it was rude, racist, inconsistent and exceptionally poor due to me using my Groupon.

First, off the ladies there consistently give me less chicken, rice and beans than other customers. I used the coupon and another person behind me bought a regular burrito. He was obviously Caucasian while I am of an Indian demeanor. He got a complete scoop of chicken while I got half of one. When I mentioned this they just undermined my concern and said get a large burrito if you want more. I want as much as I deserve with a regular burrito. Then she continues to sprinkle not a even a half a gram of any additional topping I ask for. I got maybe four strands of cheese as if she kept count while the customer behind me received a complete handful. Unacceptable is an understatement.  She even forgot to put salsa, I reminded her and she said she already had. And then she realized she hadn't but didn't admit it, she gave me attitude and said here have some more. I just want the amount I paid for, nothing more. But that's too much to ask for at this establishment. Finally, when I checked out, I showed her my Groupon. She started questioning me and saying why didn't I tell her before. I asked her how it made a difference and she had no reply. She said tell me before. I suspect she would've further decreased the food I received had she had known prior to making the burrito. When I was leaving and collecting my two drinks and two burritos she didn't even hand me a bag. They regularly pack all your items into a bag for convenience - as was done for the patron infront of me. But she chose to instead assist the customer behind before she had finished servicing me. I asked and she said why do you need it. I said to put my things in and then she finally gave me the bag. Very unsettling experience considering how everyone else was treated. Not going to go again unless someone else is making the burritos (the man that works there is usually very polite)."}
{"text":"Saw Burrito Zone a while ago not far away from Brampton staple Burrito Boyz. Bold move.

Tried it out recently and I was pleasantly surprised. Black beans, chicken mole, and salsa verde on the menu? Free nachos included with burrito? Staff who aren't jerks (they're actually SUPER nice)? Jarritos soda available? Count me in.

This seems to be a slightly more latin-authentic take on the burrito than the Boyz down the street. They even have latin music playing as you eat. Oh yes, they have SEATING. Which shouldn't be as impressive as it is but it is when you consider the closet their competitor does business in.

I will definitely be back here and truly hope they succeed. When I was there I was the only one and for some reason there were like 4 employees there so hopefully that was just a one-off..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a burrito. Do NOT go there.  Nothing fresh or authentic about this place. With tsp size servings in a giant wrap. Which by the way are frozen a defrosted. There meat comes out of packaged frozen bags.  Even at $5 special.  Huge disappointment.  One try was to many. Horrible"}
{"text":"The food itself is fine, nothing special but nothing terrible. 3/5
My issue is with the staff not being punctual by opening late and closing early. I've had multiple instances where I've arrived at 11 and no one was even there preparing to open (yes I did wait 15 minutes after, but still no one showed up). My most recent incident was a couple days ago (see photo for proof) where they closed over half an hour early. I arrived before 10:30, I didn't think to take any photos until after getting food next door. It's completely unacceptable that the staff can just decide when they want to open and close with a complete disregard to their customers. Sure it wasn't that busy, but that doesn't mean a business can close early. If you aren't generating enough business then cut the hours, but don't advertise on the door and online that you are open until 11PM when you clearly close earlier. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very low key burritos. They are pretty stingy on the toppings. Plus bathroom didn't have soap to wash hands in. Really really stingy. I ordered the veggie burrito, the cheese and toppings were so little that all i was able to taste was the tortilla...disappointed because i know i have had better burritos."}
{"text":"I like trying out burrito places. I have been to Burrito Boyz, Big Bite Burrito, Chipotle, Mucho Burrito, Smoke's Burritorie and many more burrito places that I cannot recall. The reason why I am writing a review for this burrito place is because I was mind blown. Here are the reasons why:
1) Chipotle and Mucho preheats your tortilla before placing the topping in your burrito. Mucho then puts it in a grill after toppings are placed but only for like 2 - 3 seconds in the grill. Burrito Boys and Big Bite definitely heat it after the toppings are placed. However, this place did it both before and after. They heated the tortilla before and after the toppings are placed inside your burrito for a good period of time. This surprised me because thats alot of time devoted to one burrito. And it is commendable that they are willing to do that for their customers. 
2) When they opened the lid of the toppings, the food was steaming hot. I have not seen that in any burrito place yet. This means they have high respect for the temperature of the food and maybe one of the goals is to give their customer a warm hearty meal.
3) The decor was not overly done. It was in fact clean and contemporary and I was actually thinking of dining in but ended up taking out due to personals reasons which had nothing to do with the burrito place.
4) The added value was their servings. Their servings of toppings was alot generous than other burrito places I have been to. I left happy because I felt like I was getting my money's worth. 
5) They put a smiley face on the wrapper of the burrito too. No other burrito place did that. They made the burrito extremely personal and I felt like that was the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Really did not find this place that bad for the quantity of food and price. This place is so close to my house so it's convenient, quick, cheap and relatively healthy providing me with a serving of black and pinto beans, fresh vegetables, in a corn /whole wheat wrap. It makes for a great filling affordable meal. So, don't let the other comments sway you, it's honestly not that bad. 
Yes, I do agree with some of the commenters that the ground beef and chicken strips are albeit sub-par quality, their Fish tacos, Carnita and Beef strips on the other hand are quite good and seems more like real meat. If you want it hotter, ask them to keep it on the grill a little longer? So don't expect a mexican senore grounding corn and flipping fresh maza tortilla for you geez... it's a $7 Burrito and it tastes pretty good! 


Recommend to try:
Fish Tacos with Pineapple curry sauce 
Carnita Burrito with Green and red salsa 
Beef Strip tacos"}
{"text":"When I saw that a burrito place moved into town, I got super excited. I think this might be the first one I've seen near me. However, the excitement didn't last long. I saw past bad reviews before I came but I decided to see for myself. 

I ordered a chicken burrito with guac. It's not horrible, it's just not good. The flavour lacks, it was cold despite putting it on the press, and the ingredients seemed to be laid out sloppily during the ordering. I really wanted to like this place because I love burritos and it would have been a convenient location for me to get one. The service was relatively friendly - cashier, maybe the owner, was super nice, and the environment is modern. If they step up their burrito-making game, get their flavours down right, and heat up their burritos nicely, I'd go again. But for now, I'll drive a bit more for a good bite."}
{"text":"Nasty place - the veggies are brown and rotting in the trays, the 'large' burrito is at best a snack size, the 'extreme nachos' include a steak-like substance (as if Arby's did something that tried to resemble carne asada) with a texture like rubber and the colour of that tennis ball the dog chewed the green fuzzy part off and buried in the backyard for the last 5 years, that is coated in a horrid bbq style sauce (wot?!?), no decent drink options other than beer (People: Jarritos?  Izze? Anything but bottled industrial pop, please)

Oh, and over the house system is ethnic music while gangsta rap is being cranked on the teevees.

Must say, the pork wasn't horrid (and the only plus is that unlike Mucho Burrito, they knew that carnitas was pork!), and they have Cholula.

But those two points are not enough to save them.
Can't believe I'd find a place worse than Mucho Burrito, but there ya go - setting the barre lower!  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Ok, so Saturday night hanging with the boys and we were all looking for something new for dinner before a night of great movies. After going through the \"usual suspects\" we found Burrito Zone online and gave them a call to see what's what. Spoke to an AWESOME, helpful dude who went through their menu with me...ordered some delivery, and was NOT disappointed!!! The food arrived quickly via a friendly, smiling delivery guy and was amazing! I had to warm it up a touch but that was my fault considering I had to fight off two 150 lb dogs who were really interested in what had come to the door lol. All in all, would MOST DEFINITELY order from Burrito Zone again and again. Give this Scarborough gem a try....they are genuinely and wholly interested in providing our neighbourhood with tasty Mexican fare.  Mucho Burrito better watch their back....Scarborough is in the Burrito Zone now! Ol√©!!!"}
{"text":"Food has not met expectations at all. In store didn't taste good, Uber Eats was cold and didn't taste good. Would definitely not recommend at all, not even if you were dying. Get & Go burrito all the way!"}
{"text":"(Sigh) Burrito Zone is one of those places where you know you shouldn't go back to, but continue to go back to it anyways. 
The food itself doesn't taste terrible, but you definitely feel terrible afterwards (ie. No motivation to work after lunch). They have standard ingredients for a burrito place, but there are other places that totally outclass this place.  It also doesn't help that the staff seem like they really hate their job."}
{"text":"I saw this place, wanted a burrito and decided to go for it without checking reviews first. It was empty when I went, which means that it is probably not going to be worth it, but I was hungry, so food is food.

Overall, I wouldn't say it is great, but it is a burrito. In the absence of good Mexican food in Markham, this is a spot that you can get something. Really anything at all of the Mexican nature.

They do have good deals though, and a good selection of toppings. You can get a pretty thick burrito! Overall, I think I would hold off for a mean burrito or just make something my self. If you are in the area, and need a mexican fix though, there isn't really too many options, so this place will do."}
{"text":"As there was a big sign saying it was \"globally inspired\", I expected it to be not authentic, and this review was based on if I enjoyed the food, not on its authenticity.

I ordered 3 soft tacos that came with a snack size nacho ($6.29).  I chose carnita, chicken mole and fish tacos.  I was allowed to choose any topping except guacamole costed extra.  

The soft tortilla shell totally ruined the taco: it was a flour tortilla not a corn tortilla.  It was thick, tasteless, not soft enough.

The fish taco was the worst:  the fish was completely dry, the outer layer breading too thick and fried to too hard.  It was not enjoyable. 

The chicken mole taco was better.  The chicken was tender and marinated, but I could not taste any mole.  Expect a chicken taco not a chicken \"mole\" taco if you order this.

The carnita taco was the best of the three.  It was juicy and tasted okay.  I wished the flavour was more intense, but as I said, this was acceptable. 

In conclusion, stay away from the fish taco and burrito.  Carnita and chicken are okay.  I didn't try the other types of meat nor any burrito, so I can't comment on them."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise.  Have been wanting to try this place since it opened - glad that we did.  Food was fresh and tasty.  The store was  very clean.  Serving sizes were very large (at least they were large for me - I split my burrito bowl over two meals, and was stuffed for both - my husband ate his burrito bowl in one sitting and was also stuffed).  Toppings were generous - good selection of free toppings.  Staff were very friendly.  We actually ate in-store because we were on-the-run and didn't want to eat in the car.  There are a few bar-height stools and a counter along the window for eating in-store.  We would be more inclined to go there more often if there was more seating or traditional table seating, but the space is limited - they've done the best they can with the space available.  There aren't a lot of cheap and cheerful places to eat in the area and not a lot of variety - glad this store has opened - hoping it does well and stays as good as it was this weekend."}
{"text":"I came in hoping for a chicken and shrimp burrito but i was informed that this franchise doesnt carry a lot of items listed on their site and shrimp was one of them. I settled for a large chicken tinga burrito. The wrap for large and regular is the same but the size determines the amount of protein given in the burrito. The chicken tinga was warm and not hot and the size of the burrito was small in size(even though I ordered a large). 

There were stacks of food under the (malfunctioning) heating lamp and the franchise was empty during lunch time for a reason."}
{"text":"WOW.....why so much hate for this place. I didn't think it was that bad. Went on a Wed afternoon. Ordered a large chicken burrito for $7.99 +$1 for guacamole. 
I was explained each type of flavoured chicken they had which was nice. He also recommended which combination of sauce would be best which I also liked. As I was being cashed out I was greeted with a huge smile by a separate cashier. She asked how I found out about the place and I answered that I lived close by. So overall I found the service to be very quick and friendly. 

As for the food it wasn't too bad. I was given a decent portion of chicken meat. Added all the veggie ingredients that I liked. The meal was very filling and very decent. Nothing that will WOW you but its a good quick meal if you want something other than a quick burger. Sure my burrito could have used more cheese but I'm sure if I asked the guy to put more cheese he would have. I'm not greedy so I usually just let them add what they feel is right. 

Add more cheese and I'm sure the reviews will get higher ratings...lol"}
{"text":"Hmm the food is ok, but I have a feeling that they are adjusting the menu prices on the fly. I asked for a topping but the price premium they told me for it was twice what is listed on the menu.  Are the prices suggestions only and they modify it based on how much money they need to make or something?  Just don't go here."}
{"text":"Never order their tacos of any kind of meat. It's the most dry, rubbery, and bland thing you will ever try to eat. Buy hey if you loved chewing on your eraser when you were in grade school then this is the place for you, but it would definitely be a huge mistake coming here. The wings are alright, they kinda taste like food, which is always a good thing for a restaurant to be serving."}
{"text":"Friendly staff horrible food, slow service. It took 20 mintues for my order the place was empty and I was the only customer. Salsa was out of a bottle and toppings were few and far between. Chicken was not fresh and $1.00 extra for guacamole is just ridiculous for any burrito place. It's not authentic Mexican or text Mex. Poorly run franchise. I will never got there again."}
{"text":"This is probably the best burrito I've had in the Markham/Thornhill area. The staff is always super friendly and go over and beyond with their customer service. The flavours are consistent each time I go. My favorite is the jerk chicken burrito! Highly recommend this place if you're looking for good mexican food with flavour!"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience today!!!

 It took 3 phone calls with their incompetent staff to place an order for delivery (they kept hanging up even before I could give my address) 

One hour later, I call back and they told me that my order was CANCELLED! They made excuses for their own mistake and I never even got an apology. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly this place is really good. Those Nachos are amazing and the quality of the food is above expectation for a fast food chain.  You can also grab a bottle of jarritos if you like that stuff. Good amount of seating area although it wasn't the brightest. The Mexican street corn also looks amazing and for $3.99, it's pretty legit."}
{"text":"Well I'm at a hotel 8km away and ordered food 35 min ago. Waiting for my food to arrive and I get a call saying that my area is out of there range. Our hotel is 15min away Google maps say. Would not suggest trying to order deliver from here."}
{"text":"Walked in and checked-in.. saw the huge empty restaurant with 1 person working the place and a 2 star review.. Ordered a Chicken Mole Large Burrito, came up to $10.  To be honest it was much better then I expected.

3 star experience.. wouldn't crave this place but have nothing against it either.. would revisit if someone wanted to come."}
{"text":"I ordered from SkipTheDishes. I got a beef burrito. It was really bad. It wans't bad in the sense that this is poor quality and they could have made it better, it was just bad in the gross kind of way. It had a very weird sour taste to it. I had nothing sour in my burrito. I ended up throwing it out."}
{"text":"This place was not that great for me. I had three hard shell tacos to start and they were all quite disappointing. They had a variety of 5 or 6 meats to choose from but from the 3 that I chose, they all tasted the same. They were really bland. I had the Butter Chicken, Carnitas and Ground Beef. Definitely not memorable or would be the reason to come back here.

I noticed one of the other reviews mentioned to have the Churros so I gave those a try too. These were surprisingly pretty good. They were served warm and were very crispy on the outside. For a cheap sweet snack, I recommend giving these a try. Unfortunately this place doesn't have chocolate or caramel syrup to fill the center. 

I'm not sure if it's worth coming back to try other things on the menu but if I have a craving for Churros I'd pick up one or two."}
{"text":"Even though the reviews aren't the best- I tried it anyway. It was so worth it. It's my husbands and my new favourite place and can't wait to take visitors good flavours of meat, variety of burrito sauces, and good combo specials"}
{"text":"Im really surprised with the reviews. This place has always been great. Quick, fast and friendly. 

They updated their signs from the last time I came by. The jerk chicken quesadilla and steak burrito never disappoints."}
{"text":"Worst quesadilla ever!  When you think of a quesadilla you think cheesy goodness with fresh ingredients... This had LITERALLY one spoon of cheese and this saucy meat that puddled in my plate and made the whole thing a big soggy mess!  Granted the veggies were fresh, the kid who made it had no idea what a quesadilla was (management should maybe offer more training into the meals their staff are responsible to make?). Also more than half my quesadilla had nothing on it... It was just plain tortilla (that should clue you in to add more cheese!).  It's really hard to mess up Mexican food but Burrito Zone beat the odds and failed.  If you can tell by my post.. I was terribly disappointed with my meal."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.   I'm now a regular here. Food is excellent and for under $10 I get filled up and the best part is it's all healthy choices so totally guilt free with all the flavour.  If you're avoiding gluten ask for the corn flour wrap!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't say I was impressed with this little restaurant tucked into the Hwy7 & McCowan plaza.

I ordered the burrito and I was 100% ... no. It's just that I expect burritos to be full - in terms of flavour and of how they wrapped the fillings (firm).  My burrito was soggy and it seemed like I was eating mush with sauce dribbled over it.  
The fries were super-ordinary average.  They weren't awful but they aren't something I'll order again.
I gave an extra star on top of my star because of how much my boyfriend seemed to be enjoying his quesadillas.  The shell was crispy (bonus) and they tasted even.

However, this is 0% authentic and I definitely don't see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"Totally nasty experience. Will be surprised if they last.

Ordered 1 4 taco meal, 1 taco meal, a chicken quesadilla and nachos with cheese.

The liquid cheese on the nachos is nasty (clumpy).
The Taco Beef is pasty (doesn't even taste like beef). Taco beef also had no gravy, sauce or seasoning.

This was the worst experience ever. Pretty bad when Taco Bell beats this place hands down....

Won't be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to order chicken burrito.The woman server here is very rude. I will never come back here anymore!"}
{"text":"Food: 2 stars
The only reason why it's not one star is because I think the burrito isn't bad taste-wise.
My boyfriend and I have been coming here for burritos from when they first opened until now and yesterday will probably be our last time. We do suspect that they've changed owners a few times throughout the years though. The burritos have gotten smaller and smaller each time we go back and they have been getting more and more stingy with their filling and toppings. We were able to get both types of beans before but now we're told we're only allowed one type with regular size burritos. My boyfriend asked for more olives and the guy gave  him one more olive! If you watch them make your burrito, you can see how they're so diligent in giving you a small amount of everything. 

Ambiance: 3 stars
Good little area to sit and dine in but not very comfortable seating (food court style). I do like their light fixtures but the place could be a bit brighter. 

Service: 2 stars
There isn't much service other than assembling your burrito for you. Subpar service when a customer askes for more olives and you give ONE olive."}
{"text":"Great selection to make your burritos different everytime. Quick and easy. Very good flavors"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the burritos here at all, it didn't taste good and made me feel sick afterwards."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try, and the staff was friendly over the phone and the ingredients did taste fresh. However, it took over an hour for delivery, and there was little to no meat."}
{"text":"Diggin their burritos! This place and my other go to spot is where I'm goin for burritos. Burritos are big and delicious."}
{"text":"Missed the lunch special from 11:30 to 1:30 p.m. (any large burrito free pop can) but I had a sudden hunkering for burrito zone. Hefty for a large, which means two scoops of meat as opposed to one) text 6473605375 to win free burrito a week for one year. Butter chicken is kind of bland but I would think the jerk chicken has hope. C'mon, you need sauce! $9.05 tax in. OLIVES DON'T BELONG ON A BURRITO!"}
{"text":"Relatively new burrito place in the area. Price is not bad starting at $5.99 for regular and $7.99 for large burrito. I have tried the chicken mole, butter chicken, and the fish. Fish could be a lot better not a big fan of their fish burrito compared to other. Lots of fillings to choose from and decent size.

Regular and large burrito uses the same tortilla wrap so go nuts with the filling if you get regular."}
{"text":"Service was good and the facility appeared clean.  I ordered the jerk chicken burrito with the normal stuff; rice, black beans, etc, etc.  The taste was generic and listless, even with the pineapple curry sauce on top of the jerk heat, which was low in my opinion.  If you're really hungry and without options this fills your stomach otherwise there are no other redeeming qualities."}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke.  My burrito had one spoon of cheese.  They hire kids who don't know how to count change.  I gave him $5.75 for a $5.65 burrito and he supposed to give me back $0.10.  He goes \"You still owe me another quarter\".  WTF.  I told him that I gave you $5.75 look closely.  Duh!.

I asked for burrito sauce, they go \"we don't have any\".  Tasted so plain :(  The hot sauce isn't even that hot.  It lacks the real burrito ingrediants, such as fried onions and green peppers.  

Their just imitating the concept of a burrito without the skills and ingredients of how to make one.  I can imagine their profit margins are very thin and I don't expect them to survive this a tough competitive market."}
