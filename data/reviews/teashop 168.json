{"text":"The man who works there is nice. The bubble tea is good :). The only complaint I have about the place is that there's this odd smell of bubble tea that lingers every time I go."}
{"text":"man I wish they still sold the frozen yougurt by yougen fruz and that you for having mil tea 2.50 all year round"}
{"text":"There is no real tea in there. It's all powder stuff. We went in and scanned and followed them and it says \"buy one get one free\" on wechat. So I asked the young guy (who looks very depressed by the way) who was running the store and he said it's just $1 off a drink. So we were like, okay...then he \"forgot\" to give us the $1 off when we checked out. We ended up getting the $1 off but we got an extra large when we asked for a large."}
{"text":"Original Milk Tea is still the best!Teashop 168 is my go to bubble tea spot in downtown Toronto. The drinks are sweetened to my taste, the service is nice, the drinks are made on the spot and they are affordable. OG Milk tea runs for $2.50 for a regular so no complaints at all. All other flavors are available, like honey dew, coconut, strawberry, taro, all that good stuff- but I'm a purist and to be honest, HK Milk Tea is the best.   Overall, a good bang for the buck and great compared to other places."}
{"text":"Same concept as other 168s, but this one is a bit better.   Not as mobbed as the one at Bloor & Bathurst, with the friendliest service I've ever had at a bubble tea place (thanks, Jason!).   Be sure to get their reusable travel cup to take advantage of their anniversary prices on the 20th of each month!"}
