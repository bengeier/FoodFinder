{"text":"My first rule for reading Yelp reviews is, if somebody leaves a one or two star review, click on their name and look at other reviews they've left. If the majority of them are one or two stars, chances are they're just bitter, unhappy people who feel the world owes them everything. I've been to the Ale House many times and find it to be a very warm, cozy, relaxed, and friendly place to sit down and enjoy a good craft beer. Yes sometimes the hours are a tad sketchy (I have found the door locked myself a time or two but will still return). But if you're traveling a great distance, you can always call ahead to make sure they'll be open when you get there (and while you're doing that you can ask if they accept credit cards in advance, rather than going online and calling the bartender an \"asshole\")."}
{"text":"We attempted to go here with a wedding party.  The bartender was a major asshole and refused to allow credit cards or any mixed drinks or shots of any kind.  I would highly recommend avoiding this place.  Terrible service and major disrespect to customers."}
{"text":"If Saturday night was any indication, this place is doomed. Some of our cycling group rode out from Madison on the Badger State Trail and tried to stop for a beer at the Ale House.

At roughly 8pm on a Saturday night, the bar is closed because the owner has decided to \"leave for a bit\" and leave his cell number on the handwritten sign in the window. We called; no answer.

It's my fervent hope that this place tanks quickly, so that someone who actually knows how to run a tap-house can buy it and turn it around. Because, ya know, it doesn't really matter whether you've got great beer on tap if the bloody door isn't open."}
{"text":"The Ale House has got the best taps in Belleville hands down.  In its current iteration the Ale House is a drinks-only bar while one of the owners recuperates.  There are eight rotating Wisconsin beers on tap and a good selection of higher-end spirits on the back bar.  I've been stopping in with my parents on the weekends and I believe my father is becoming a bit of a weekday regular as well.  Back when the kitchen was open I'd had a couple of wonderful meals, including pork rib tacos that some of the best I've had.  They'll be getting that back up and running soon."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time here last weekend. After hitting the PolkaFest in New Glarus, we were looking to escape the crowds, and this was just the place. 

Everything about the place is unique and welcoming, from the regulars, to the dog Lucy, and especially Pat the owner and bartender. All made us feel welcome, even if we were first-timer tourists. The atmosphere is exceedingly unique and cool, with many personal touches all around the place. Lots of Blatz beer memorabilia, brand new shuffleboard table, a giant elk, moose antlers, vintage skis, an Elvis clock, cobalt glass bottles, a handmade bar, and lots more eclectic decor. 

The beer selection was top notch, and even better taps than we found in New Glarus, where everything seems to be New Glarus beer all the time (nothing wrong with that). Really good focus on local and regional brewers, there were taps from Titletown, Common Thread, Hop Garden (Belleville), Lena, Vintage, Central Waters, Summit, and Hinterland. New Glarus Berliner Weisse in the cooler, along with old standbys and unique craft beers. Another plus is that they update the beer list on beermenus. If beer isn't your thing, they also had an impressive selection of over 40 whiskeys. 

We didn't think they served food here, but lucked out since there was a Saturday special of homemade pork/chicken gumbo, which was served with homemade cornbread and bourbon butter. It was really tasty. The owner used to be a chef and ran a restaurant here prior to opening the Ale House. Our bill for two beers, gumbo and a big pretzel was $16, that's cheap for such high quality.

They are only open 3 days a week, and it's just one guy running the show. If you are traveling a distance or bringing a group it would be wise to call ahead. The one-star reviews here reflect more on shortsighted personal entitlement than the establishment, from my experience."}
{"text":"TVs...nope, Open all the time...nope, Great food selection ...nope!  This is why The Ale House has become my favorite bar.

I like the fact that Pat doesn't have TVs all over the place.  It allows for great conversationn either with the friends you came with, Pat, or the regulars at the bar.  The only times Pat brings out the TV is when the Badgers or Packers are broadcast over the air.  Sweet! 

I've seen the reviews that the Ale House isn't open all the time.  Please understand Pat's a one man shop.  He's the Owner, Bartender, Buss Boy, and one hell of a chef.   So I understand if he takes a night off now and then.  The Ale House is open at least the regular nights, Thursday,  Friday, and Saturday...so that's fine with me(he's probably open more, but I don't get out that much).

As far as the food selection...the Sugar River Pizzaria will deliver, and Pat usually has Soft Pretzels, but that's it for standard food.  But don't be disappointed!   Pat usually has a special for the week, Brisket Tacos, Pulled Pork Nachos, or some other creation that I can't do justice.  Like I side above, Pat is a great Chef, his experience and his combination of flavors is a wonderful addition to Belleville dinner scene.  In addition to the food, Pat keeps a mad selection of local taps in rotation.  There's always some new beer, that Pat will educate you on.

With the points above, plus a shuffle board table, the occasional jam session (last Friday Bobby Messano), and a random dog, the Ale House is the place to be.

WIN!"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. This place is bad. Unreliable hours, lousy service. If you get lucky and find them open and with a server, the food is well cooked. Unfortunately, the unplanned closings and service ruin this place."}
{"text":"Love the beer on tap here.  I second the comment about Glacier Trail."}
{"text":"Best place to go in Belleville to try local micro brewery beers. Pat is the owner and he is always bartending at least the number of times I have gone. Couldn't say there is a much better place go hang out than here."}
