{"text":"My review is going to be based on the fact that I am from St catharines and really deprived of indian food...especially dhaba style.
Came here on a friends recommendation.
Food is ammazing portions are huge....thali is huge!
I ordered non veg Thaali...came in a solid white large thaali with one choice of meat so I picked goat curry...i also had options of 2 Vege sides so I got (lentials)daal makhni and spinach (saag)
I honestly can't find any flaws... the girl who works here is sweet and she even let me try a little piece of the potato.
Very satisfied overall!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, prompt friendly service. Goat curry and sang were delicious and authentic!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, wanted to omit yogurt and sweet from one of the Thalis we ordered.  However, the host put it in the thali anyways, and told me to eat around it. What a waste of food and terrible resolution (SMH). Also, the prices are a bit more than advertised on their menu board. Found that to be dishonest. Heard another patron complain about the difference in prices, the hostess told him they had to pay the rent. I mean, how professional and host-like is that?! The food was decent, but service terrible. Also, apparently only one channel is available on their TV and the hostess said they can't change it because that's all they have. How do they stay open?"}
{"text":"My Indian friend raves about this place so had to try it! Very small location. About 10 tables, very much a cafe setting. A ton of sweets available and you can order from the menu or they have specials in the restaurant. We did take out and got lamb and chicken keema. Basically it's two thin naan breads with meat in the middle. They also give you sauce which you dip the naan. It is spicy but delicious. Also got Somosas which were very fresh and paneer which was also fresh - a little too oily than I like them
To be though.  Great service, friendly staff. I'd recommend ordering before arrival because it was very busy when I went into the restaurant.  There is a tv and there is a hot food counter which reminded me of dosa options but I did not get it so not sure what they had as options.  Very nice and clean, will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, no respect for customers whatsoever. Ordered Chaat Papri to go, got home and noticed it was very plain, only topped with yogurt, potatoes, chickpeas and tamarind chutney. Called the restaurant asking why it was so plain and didn't have any coriander, onions, spices, green chutney. The owner came on the phone and said \"this is how we make it, whether you come back or not I don't care, this is how we make it\". No apologies, no concerns. Also found some small sort of stone or bone within the food.  This place used to have good food and excellent service, used to enjoy eating here quite a bit, it has changed for the worse. It has become unhygienic and the service has gone out the door. I'm not a fan of leaving negative reviews, but the way the manager spoke to me over the phone put it over the top. Sorry \"Friends Restaurant\", you just lost a once-satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Great samosas, tasty fresh naan. Easily accessible in the Brampton vicinity, and always a good place to pick up some snacks or fresh naan to go with home made food. We always come here when the families have parties at home.

The chaat papdi is really tasty. On a regular basis the family picks up chana bhatoora and they are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to order a take-out lunch. Ordered their meat thali which comes with rice, salad, naan, 3 non-veg dishes (butter chicken, goat curry and chicken curry) and some snacks from their hot food counter - samosas (3 for $1), bread pakora and vegetable pakoras and Hollllllly salt!!!!  If you're into sodium highs, this is the place to be! I could only eat one of their pakoras and had to throw out the rest. Their thali was a huge meh. Ingredients don't seem to be very fresh and I think most of it is frozen and re-heated or packaged. Prices are pretty high compared to other restaurants in the area for similar food. Waste of time and money."}
