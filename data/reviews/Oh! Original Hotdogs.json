{"text":"Hey there, it's Foodie T. here.   I was initially excited when this place first showed up in the neighbourhood. Unfortunately, I was QUICKLY disappointed after stoppin through this joint!   Okay, here we go -- I'm gonna start with the bad news.  1. Let me start with the website -- IT MAKES NO SENSE.   2. This place is pricey AF and defs not work forkin over all that $$$  SOME REDEEMING FACTORS:   Milkshakes are kinda dope  Fried Pickles are rather tasty   ***LIFE HACK***  Go to spadina and bloor, get a bigger + cheaper hotdog and go to Oh! Original Hotdogs for the curly fries or fried pickles."}
{"text":"This brand new, funky little gritty dive opened up on Bloor Street West last weekend!  The boyfriend and I stumbled into it after our unsuccessful pursuit of locating a street dog vendor and this new place seemed like a much better compromise. The menu looked promising and our excitement grew with the enthusiasm of the staff and who we imagined was the owner.   Originally I wanted to order the \"Gring-OH\" but after we were told that one of the staff had dropped the jalapeno bottle caps (poor guy), I settled on the \"OH-riental Express\" while the boyfriend ordered the \"OH-Down, Hoe-Down\". *Cue excitement*  We took our hot dogs to a side street off of Bloor, sat on the bench and opened our container. First impression: basic looking hot dog and bun; nothing extraordinary or over the top. After tasting the hot dog, we both settled that though we appreciated the concept and the attempt, it was nothing more than a plain ol' hot dog dressed up in  some okay toppings. Boyfriend said he barely got any pulled pork and I commented that I wished I tasted more of the wasabi and ginger in the mayo. We did get some kettle chips on the side, which was a nice surprise, but it too wasn't anything spectacular. All in all, the place left much to be desired.  Considering the joint is new, I'll definitely give them a go another time!"}
{"text":"Blundered into this place late last night while blundering along Blunder St.  Other that Fancy Franks, I had yet to see a dedicated hot doggery, so in I went.  The staff were helpful, albeit a little surly, but I'll cut them a break since they were closing relatively soon and here I come wanting hot dogs. I asked what I should try out as a first timer and was recommended the Chip-OH-tle Dog, or something like that. It was advertised as being topped with chilli, diced onions and mustard.  As a side dish, I was recommended the tater tots. I thought these would have been house-made, original tater tots, but no. These were McCain style frozen tots complete with squishy texture. But served with garlic mayo, they were alright.  Now, the hot dog was exactly as advertised above. Not bad, but not great. The flavours and textures and temperatures didn't quite work together.   It was topped with beef chilli, but there was no spice or flavour.  It was topped with onions, but they were crunchy and cold. Maybe saut√©ed onions were an option, I don't know.  The mustard was just prepared yellow mustard, nothing special.   The dog itself was alright. Juicy and savoury.  But all these toppings made the untoasted bun very soggy and hard to handle, if I wasn't such a disgusting slob of an eater anyways, I might have been put off.  I don't know, maybe it's the country bumpkin in me, but when I pay $9.50 for a hot dog combo, I expect a great experience.  But they do have free refills on pop, and that is always cool.   As posted, I give this place 3/5, and would more than likely come back to try something new since my hot dog cravings border on medically unsafe."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I'm a total sucker for nice hot dogs, so it's right up my alley.  If you're one of those people that says \"omg how can they charge 7 dollars for just a hot dog\" maybe just don't go to places like this.  It's not supposed to be a competitor of hot dog carts, it's a better thing and so it cost more."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place tonight while feeling munchy during my late night walk with my s/o. The interior was very nicely decorated, with funky lights and big bold words everywhere.   The friendly cashier recommended the Oh-gring-oh! since we were into spicy food. I believe it was between $6-$7 and some seasoned curly fries for $3 or so. The food came in a separate styrofoam containers - which I thought was a bit too much especially since we were eating there. Perhaps investing in plastic baskets would be best for those eating there?  The oh-gring-oh hot dog had jalepeno poppers, guacamole, picca de gallo, cheese, and we chose wasabi ginger mayo as the sauce. The hot dog itself wasn't anything amazing but somehow I felt like it was a \"healthier\" version of street side hot dogs lol... The sausage, I believe, was boiled - which I actually like. Felt like how my momma made it as a kid! :P the wasabi dressing was a nice touch, didn't taste the ginger. The jalepeno poppers had a nice kick to it, although it was falling off the hot dog. The hot dog was kind of messy in the container, I guess because there was too much going on. The curly fries were delish! Perfectly seasoned!  I'd definitely come back to try some more items - really looking forward to coming back here all summer, esp to try out some milkshakes! Great addition to Bloor St. West!"}
{"text":"I do NOT envy these people at 3am. Great hot dogs, totally reasonable pricing (especially given the area), really really lovely staff, and enough variety for everyone.   Probably totally bananas with the after-bar crowd, cuz it's open super late, but it's dialed-up street meat and that's pretty awesome.   I don't recommend the panko deep-fried one; the Japanese sauces are tasty, but it makes the dog a bit chewy. Huge props for the one with the pulled pork (I admit to getting that one with everything but the pork, being a veggie and all). And the steamies are simple and delicious... According to my dining pals. Veggie hotdog is entirely satisfactory.  Curly fries over the tater tots. Maple ketchup over the garlic mayo. And you will not regret a cake milkshake either."}
