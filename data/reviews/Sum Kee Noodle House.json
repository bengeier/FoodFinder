{"text":"I'm Chinese and used to pretty authentic Chinese food because parents used to own a restaurant. I've been looking for a decent Chinese restaurant in the east end and I think I've finally found it!  The food tastes pretty authentic and the prices are great!  The decor is nothing to write home about but I've only done take-away.  The food won't be fancy or come with elaborate swans made of salt, but it's good value and good eats!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Not enough places like this in Toronto. Straight up good tasting food and very good prices. The staff is always really polite and nice without overdoing it. The d√©cor is just fine for what they are selling and it's mostly a take-out place for locals anyways, so no issues there. The cook makes all meals right in front of you so you can trust this place. Avoid lunchtime rush as its jam packed with kids but otherwise you'll never wait more than 5-10 minutes for your food."}
{"text":"Signed up just to write a review for this place. I went on a whim one night when I had no groceries and was too lazy to go to the grocery store. It is very good. Probably the best in Leslieville that I have tried. And you get much better on the price. My \"go-to\" is combo #2 - Chow Mein, Chicken Balls and a spring roll for $6.25. The lady that greets me at the door is very nice and polite. If I have questions about dishes she is very helpful.

The only down side I can only see is the interior. It isn't very nice, but that is fine as I see it more as a take out place anyways. The quality of food and the price far outweigh the interior."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap yet tasty food, this would be ideal. Each noodle or rice dish is around 5ish. They're quite fast in cooking and they do it right infront of you. Seating is limited and not that appealing so you may prefer to do take out more often than not. 

My favourite food there include Shang Hai Noodles and Singapore Noodles. Their Satay Beef noodle is also incredible, it's one of my boyfriend's favourite food."}
{"text":"coming from Vancouver, the land of easily accessible Chinese food, I found it difficult to find good Chinese food in the east end. having living in the area, I've passed by Sum Kee many times and always wondered how the food was. Finally ordered take out today and definitely was not disappointed. Service was quick, food way piping hot and definitely had \"wok hay\". I will definitely be back to try more dishes. 

So happy I don't have to go out to Congee Star or Congee Queen to get my Chinese food/noodle fix"}
{"text":"Another example of a well run mom and pop shop for a Chinese restaurant.  Good place for take out, prices are very reasonable and taste is great!  I especially like the deep fried chicken wings and the Fried Shanghai Noodles dish.  No long waits for orders, and nice to see the open concept kitchen and seeing the chef use the wok and the \"wok hai\" to cook my food!! Too bad there weren't more of these restaurants around North York, as I always have to make the journey down to Gerrard and Jones for this."}
{"text":"Quick and affordable. I recommend the beef in black bean sauce with rice noodle and the chicken wings. Although, everything is great. Expect it to be greasy."}
{"text":"I want to echo the other posters here and put in a strong recommendation. Not really a sit-down restaurant (dim and dingy setting with a few tables and virtually no ambience), more of a take-out, this family-run joint serves the best stir-fry noodles and rice dishes on Gerrard at the most affordable prices ($5-6). Other entrees, like Pad Thai (poor imitation) and soups (weak), are best ignored. Oddly, the business is closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Excellent food and \"wok hay\".  The food is freshly and quickly prepared by the chef.  The strength of the fire under the wok really helps make the food wonderful.  

Very good value.  Would highly recommend for take out.  The decor in the dining room is dated, and will transport you back to the old days.  

Very tasty."}
{"text":"I love this little place. Extremely reasonable for the portion size and cooked in the open which means they have confidence about cleanliness. I see hand  washing every time from all staff handling food. Extremely consistent food quality. The staff are nice but not overly chummy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  It is a complete hole in the wall...but has great food and cheap prices.  It is not a place I would sit down to eat at, but has great take-out.  you can watch them cook your food right in front of you on their custom Wok stove.  Very friendly and delicious food.  Can feed 2 nicely for $10-$11."}
{"text":"Food tastes great and location super close when visiting mom. Never really ever ordered when grew up there but super happy. Good prices too. Went based on reviews here."}
{"text":"Sum Kee is a neighbourhood icon. I grew up in the area, went to Riverdale CI and now own a home in area. Sum Kee noodles is now owned by an earnest couple who always whip up my order quick and fast. The husband is the cook and the wife takes the orders. 

Hot piping noodles/rice/dishes cooked on a hot wok. Chinese people usually talk about the power of the wok air, ie wok temp. Sum Kees menu has always held up. I usually stop in every few weeks to order dinner.

I still love it to this day. Awesome take out. If you live in the area, it's definitely worth supporting.  Prices have stayed the same over the year $12 usually feed the wife and I and we have left overs."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Right beside a high school so really busy during lunch hour. The prices are really cheap.  The quality is down a little, ownership has changed a few times over the years.  But for the price you are paying, you can't complain.  Definately a good place to go for people on a budget.  Their food is better than the ones in east Chinatown.

They have 5 dollar combos not including tax, and the fried rice is pretty cheap.  Taste good for the price."}
