{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and it was delicious! Great presentation, all the food was fresh and delicious. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Pas pire pentoute, comme on dit en bon québécois. Pourquoi seulement 3 étoiles? Car leur riz n'est pas excellent. Je suis un maniaque d'excellent riz. Et pour moi, un resto de sushi doit servir du riz de top qualité. Et malheureusement, ce n'est pas toujours le cas. 

Pour moi, la référence en sushi au Québec c'est Tri Express. Excellent riz, excellentes recettes, excellent prix. 

Je donnerais un 4 étoile à Hiroko s'ils servaient du meilleur riz. Mais leurs recettes sont bonnes, les produits utilisés sont très bons. Ça me fait penser au Miyuki à Boucherville, mêmes qualités, même problème: le riz. 

Donc chez Hiroko, je favoriserais les recettes avec beaucoup d'ingrédients, qu'on goûte moins le riz. Tandis que y'a des places, comme Tri Express, que peu importe les sushis que tu manges, vu que le riz est excellent, tous les makis, sushis, nigiris sont bons. 

Mais pas parce que j'y donne 3 étoiles que je n'y retournerai pas. Au contraire. C'est une bonne option, une des excellentes pas trop loin de chez moi; c'est mieux qu'un Sushi Shop en tout cas. ;-)"}
{"text":"My new favourite place, great sushi, fresh fish and thoughtfully made and presented. When delivered it's always super quick and packaged carefully."}
{"text":"Très bon et rapide! Récemment aménagé très proche de cette place de Sushi, ma première commande a été pour 8 personnes, donc proche de 120 morceaux faits en 25 minutes! Les spécialités sont évidemment les meilleurs, quoi qu'un peu cher."}
{"text":"The spider roll had almost no crab in it which was really disappointing, especially given it's price. And the eel roll was also very disappointing, it didn't taste like eel at all. Can't recommend this place. Service was also very slow..."}
{"text":"Great sushi, friendly service, good value. Highly recommend this place that seems to need more customers."}
{"text":"Fairly new sushi spot on St Denis that definitely calmed my crazy-eyed craving the other day. I'd heard from a neighbour that the stuff was good and I was not disappointed. I ordered one of the chef's combo specials so as not to have to think (one of those days) and it was made fresh, quick in a sparkling clean kitchen. The roe and crab tasted amazingly good for Montreal sushi and the service was super friendly. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Although this is our neighborhood sushi place, for us, this is the only sushi place worth going to in all of Montreal! A friend recommended it to us two years ago, and we have not gone anywhere else for sushi in Montreal ever since. How foolish I now feel for not trying it on my own... I had walked by it so many times while running errands and had no idea what amazingly wonderful sushi creations were being made in this local restaurant.

The fish is always really fresh and the presentation takes my breath away. Beautiful fresh orchids and butterflies made from raw carrots often adorn our plates. In fact, I have not seen presentation like this since I frequented sushi restaurants while living in Los Angeles. But we don't come here for the presentation... we come for the wonderful sushi selection. Truthfully, one would expect the food to be much more expensive than it is for what you are getting, but no... surprisingly, it is quite affordable!

We always stay in to eat, but many people come through the door to get their sushi to go."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the service. The guy was nice enough to customized my takeout to my needs. Also, their food presentation is fabulous. It shows they have attention to details. The sushi was definitively not bad."}
{"text":"Ordered in when I saw some trust worthy reviews. It was super easy with JustEat and it arrived shortly afterwards. We took the $65 platter and it fed 3 people with none to spare. The sushi was good and fresh so overall a good experience. I found it a bit expensive for the overall, but it was good. I will likely order again if I need something easy, fast and good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Toujours frais et savoureux. Même quand on ose un autre resto on se demande pourquoi et on revient au Hiroko"}
