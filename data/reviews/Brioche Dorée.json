{"text":"I go to Brioche 1-2 times weekly, it's pretty close to my work and offers up a pretty decent latte, and really good lunch options.  Their Beet and Goat Cheese salad is amazing and actually quite filling.
3 stars because:
-the customer service is quite poor, no one is particularly friendly or helpful, a lot of the time one will direct you to another staff member, who will just stare at you until you talk
-the food is very pricey for the portion size
-the line-up area is very confusing; if you just go in for a coffee and go right up to the till, there's a moment of awkward limbo between you and a someone who is waiting for their food to be plated, but is ready to pay.
After visiting Paris last fall, it was neat to come home and see Brioche, as it is like 'the Starbucks of Paris'.  They do prepare the food almost in the exact same way, which was quite nostalgic.  Over all, very tasty, but could use a bit of work!"}
{"text":"Wowwwwwwww!!! The term \"looks can be deceiving\" come to mind. I walked into a very generous space, first off! and they have their food separated categorically in different display windows. Croissants, viennoiseries, danishes in one, dessert cakes, tarts, miscellaneous treats in another, cookies up top, and a relatively capacious drink bin fridge completely detached almost acting as a wall setting up boundary markers.
I was kind of turned off by their food, let me tell you how they just DID NOT LOOK APPETIZING IN ANY WAY. Their selection was ABUNDANT, but their viennoiserie just looked dry, burnt, and blehhh. BOY WAS I EVER WRONG AND GLAD THAT I WENT AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT AND BOUGHT MY FAVORITE-almond croissant!!!!! Most, or rather ALLL almond croissant in the city taste relatively the same if they're good, be it nadege, Jules, la cigogne...etc, if they're praise worthy, they generally don't  have too much distinction between them. Brioche doree broke that stereotype and knocked it out of the park. They just put up a new set of rules and changed the almond croissant game. Not only was I turned off by the esthetic appeal of their pastries, but also their RIDICULOUS PRICES!! NO WHERE in Toronto have I seen an almond croissant so expensive!! But now I somewhat wearily say, rightfully so! 
Their almond croissant is not soft and filled with paste like most others, it's the right amount of sweet and the consistency is a little more coarse, it's CHEWY, if you will. Might I dare say: if caramel or toffee were in bread form, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE!!!!!!! Yum! I devoured the  croissant with frightening ease on a full stomach. Thank God I live nowhere near there.

oh yes, there was a esthetically appealing guy sitting alone eating dinner and reading. Good eye candy in the patrons compensates for the ugly treats I guess."}
{"text":"Went there few times, the pear almond tart is amaaaazing, the prices can be too much for sandwiches or pastries. The soups are very good. Why not 5 stars? the customer service is not consistent. You can be served by a rude person and another time by a friendly one. On sunday the team is more helpfull even if it s busy. One sunday they didn t have black chocolate for a mocha. the barista (with a funny french accent) gived me a white chocolate to try. What a good surprise!! Now i am crazy about white mocha!
tips: go on sunday or before lunch. broccoli cheddar soup and onion quiche are amazing and for only 11$ you have your combo."}
{"text":"Service was nice but the coffee was pretty bad... I ordered a soy cappuccino and I glanced at the type of soy milk he used and it looked fine. Perhaps it was the coffee roast? Not sure. But it was the first time in my life I did not finish my coffee."}
{"text":"Almond croissant is delicious! I came in for a late breakfast and purchased a croissant and yogurt. It's a very nice atmosphere to enjoy a cup of coffee and breakfast"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful.  Fresh breads, pastries, crêpes, croissants, sandwiches, salads, soups; everything looked delicious which made it really difficult to choose.  We settled on the following:

Leek croissant - flaky pastry that melts in your mouth stuffed with a savory cheese and leek filling
Strawberry Yogurt - more dessert like than a healthy breakfast option, consisted of strawberry puree topped with yogurt with a swirl of maple syrup and a a few raspberries 
Chai latte - as a chai latte sound be; it didn't have that weird chemically after taste like some places (Second Cup or Teaopia). 

Spinach and cheese crêpe - their crêpes and sandwiches are pre-made and reheated on the grill; cheese was gooey but grilling also made the crêpe crispy around the edges which I thought was weird at first but I ended up really enjoying the contrasting textures. 
Mushroom and onion bisque - delightfully decadent, cream of mushroom soup taken up 5 notches -- my new favourite soup!
Chocolate almond croissant - a chocolate croissant sliced open and filled with almond paste, covered with icing sugar and re-baked.  Like the leek croissant it's light and melts in your mouth but with added crispiness and caramelization from being stuffed and re-baked.  To. Die. For!

Prices are typical for King West; high but still less expensive than Spring Box (a few doors down) or Fresh & Wild and quality miles above Second Cup or Starbucks.  They also have a better set up than Spring Box where it's quite easy for your grilled sandwich to go cold while you wait at a separate station for soup (or salad etc). All the baked goods are outstanding and I will definitely revisit again.  I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Great pastries. Good addition to King West neighbourhood."}
{"text":"After reading some of the previous reviews I had some apprehension. However, arriving early on a Summer weekday when the café was not particularly busy, perhaps my experience was different. The service was wonderful, the croissants fresh and crisp and the selection was good.  The place was also spotless. He barista knew his stuff and the staff were friendly overall. Even though this is a franchised chain, the experience was more like going to a local bakery. Five stars - for a chain, it doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"First things first, this place does have great food. The breakfast pastries are well-made and delicious and their lunch items are also tasty and well-priced. I come here quite often to pick up breakfast or lunch for the office - it's close-by and quick, so I will continue visiting this place for the convenience factor. 
That being said most of my experiences have been subpar as a result of bad customer service. Some of the cashiers are just rude - I've done transactions where absolutely nothing was said by the cashier, no thank you's, NOTHING. While I made an attempt to thank the server and bid her a good day, I was completely ignored. I don't have high expectations, but a little interaction and friendliness go along way and I think it's expected in this kind of establishment. If some of the workers smiled more, and were just a bit friendlier, I'd be rating this place much higher!"}
{"text":"It's my fourth time here, at this delightful little cafe, this week. I like coming in to hear the happy baristas conversing in French and sometimes humming along to the French Satellite radio. The pastries and sandwiches are all made fresh daily and are very tasty. Service is always friendly and fast. I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I've noticed a few reviews speak to the same concerns I have. While the food is tasty it is incredibly overpriced for their unimpressive portions and unfriendly service. I usually get the large salad for lunch and sometimes it's a decent portion but today my portion barely filled half the container. I asked the girl for more lettuce and she added one piece of frisee. When I asked for more she rudely said, \"I already gave you enough.\" 

I don't know if it's a culture thing but as far as I'm concerned lettuce is not a big deal to snap back at a customer about. There are plenty of other great cafes that greet you with a smile. Looks like Brioche won't be getting my lunch money going forward."}
{"text":"I come to this place once in a week for a lunch. It's is quite busy. They have great variety of pastries, baked goods and crêpes. You can mix your own salad. Don't sit near the window (at least during winter), it's quite cold over there:)"}
{"text":"This entire review rests on the almond croissant, which is AMAZING.  Perfect texture--soft and flaky on the inside, crisp around the edges, and perfect flavor--buttery pastry with enough almond cream worked in that it doesn't overwhelm.  The powdered sugar got everywhere, of course, but the pastry itself held together well, and it's priced very reasonably for the area at $3.70. I'm already tempted to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow, thanks for the 11$ rotten salad. Worst part is, I was busy at work, so I was just eating the salad; thought it tasted weird half way through so I looked down to see that a lot of my salad was rotten. I used to go there pretty frequently, but I will not be going back. Not sure if there is a way to post photos, but I will try to upload."}
{"text":"Two words:  Multigrain Croissant!

I didn't even know this magnificent creation existed but when I saw it I knew we were meant to be.  The pastry has the fresh, buttery, airy, flakey inside that is characteristic of a delicious croissant, but also uniquely has the grainy, seedy exterior.  And since it's multigrain it's totally healthy for you right? Well that's the illusion that makes it even more wonderful!  You can enjoy this delicious pastry and comfort yourself on its 'health benefits'.

I also award Bonus Points because I stopped in on a weekday evening and the croissants were still that fresh!  

As for the restaurant itself - it is brightly lit, with modern Parisian decor and communal-style seating. The staff were super friendly, and I am looking forward to returning for lunch!  Bravo."}
{"text":"Okay, here are the things I like. The danishes are awesome - it beats Dufflet up on Queen, and Wagamama over by Tecumseth. The sandwiches are expensive, but very tasty (I've had the smoked chicken with bacon and the tuna) - plus you get a small side salad. The americano was decent enough as was the cappuccino. Their dark roast is pretty good too.

A strange occurrence happened today when I ordered a croque madame (basically a grilled cheese with egg and ham). I only saw the egg-less version in the display, so I asked if it was possible to get it with egg. The server was non-committal, as if he had to check with someone. I waited a bit while others were served and I was asked for my order again. I said I was waiting on a croque madame, but I'd take the egg-less version if they couldn't provide. They started toasting up the egg-less version for me. Then, a fried egg appeared from the kitchen. I thought \"awesome, they made an egg fresh for me\". Some big guy not dressed like the servers saw the egg, grabbed the plate and chucked it in the garbage! When I suggested that said egg belonged on my sandwich, he curtly responded that they don't have any croque madames any more today. 

I'll continue coming for the occasional pastry and sandwich, but I don't think I'll try my luck ordering anything that isn't in front of me anymore (regardless of it's existence on their menu)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food. Great service. Comfy and Cozy atmosphere. Thank you. I enjoyed my visit :)"}
{"text":"This place has the best chocolate croissants I've ever had. 
I was served by a  french server who promounce Croissants delightfully. 
The great service made my french bakery experience 10 times better. =)"}
{"text":"Pour l'instant, je n'ai pas trouvé d'autres endroits qui représente mieux la boulangerie parisienne que j'ai gardé en mémoire. C'est un lieu vivant et les pâtisseries sont bonnes. Si ma mémoire est bonne, un peu cher, mais avec des journaux en papier.  Le personnel était gentil lors de mes visites."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick lunch in the King West area - Brioche Doree is your spot.

Do not be fooled by this bakery chain, they have some delicious baked goods, quiches & salads.  You can get a quiche and a little baked treat for under $10.  The croissants are heavenly, very similar to what you get in a true Parisian bakery.

Lunch time gets super busy so be sure to go early.  There is also ample seating inside so feel free to stay in for lunch.

Brioche Doree is my lunch time pick in the area for quiches and more!"}
{"text":"I looove this place!  So much in fact that I often walk my dog over as an excuse to pick up a snack since I can't resist going in!  Everything is always super fresh and delicious.  If you like to eat on the go they can heat your croissants, sandwiches & quiche for the road.  The croissants are buttery, soft & with the perfect amount of crunch.  The quiche is divine, rich but not too heavy.  Prices are reasonable for the quality and I would recommend checking it out if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Worst muffins I've ever had. I've twice ordered muffins from them and it seems more of the muffin sticks to the paper, than what I can eat. Did I mention they taste almost like raw dough? I figured the first time I ordered, it was a one off, but the second time confirmed, that no, it was not a one off. Their coffee isn't bad, but you can probably find it cheaper elsewhere and get the same quality."}
{"text":"Brioche Doree is my favourite bakery! I always get something for breakfast before heading to work; it's that good! They've got different kinds of croissants, danishes, crepes, sandwiches, salads, quiches, desserts, and soups. Even though this is a franchise chain, the staff members treat it as a local bakery. What I like about Brioche Doree is the smell, taste, quality, texture and freshness of their food, especially the bread. The place is spotless! It's obvious the owners care much about cleanliness. The staff are really friendly too! Since I come in every morning, I'm a regular now and we talk to each other on a first name basis. 

My personal favourites from Brioche Doree are the: Chocolate Croissants, Ham Omelette Croissants, Smoked Chicken Sandwich, Pasta or Potato Salad, and Chicken Noodle Soup. I also enjoy their Belgium Hot Chocolate!

If you're ever around the area and want to order take-out, Brioche Doree is in collaboration with Grabb, a mobile app that allows you to order take-out from your phone. Pre-pay on your phone and skip the line-up when you arrive to pickup your order!"}
{"text":"The address for this might be off but this location is in the path next to the kumpfert and Kim and across from rexall in the food court. I had heard about them before on blog to and was happy when I saw it at my new workplaces food court. I got the ham and Swiss croissant and my coworker got the egg and cheese one. Mine was delicious and no complaints but she said her egg was overlooked and overall it was maybe a bit too rich. She also had a latte which she said was perfect. We will be going again to try the crepes and chocolate croissants and muffins !! Bound to find something you will enjoy and be lured in by the warm sweet scents."}
{"text":"I try this place every other weekend
This week though I tried the Christmas log. Fantastic! A must try!
The girls working here are extremely polite and helpful to tell you what they have in the window!!
They serve sandwiches too and this means you can plan brunch too (i have not tried them yet)
The location is also pretty cool in my eyes, clean high class Greene Avenue! You can take a walk after your meal and enjoy the boutiques alongside the street"}
{"text":"It's a bit on the pricier side, compared to places like Cafe Crepe on Queen & John, but the atmosphere is lovely; the service is speedy, and the food tastes fine. Probably not an every day brekky place, but definitely a solid place for starting the day when the weather is good. Their coffee is alright, but not as great as Jimmy's down the street."}
{"text":"Somehow I never got to try their king west location. I rarely visit this mall as the visits here are mainly reserved for a specific item that can't be found elsewhere. I recall not having many options here other than the mainstream chain stores. 
This is a decent addition to this mall.
The cappuccino looks bland as no latte art to speak off. The espresso itself was OK. The desserts I tried were a bit better than the chain stores for sure. 2.5 Stars with a half stars."}
{"text":"Une bonne place pour les sandwiches et les plats chaud. Du choix et frais du jour.
Ils font aussi les cafés, les desserts et les viennoiseries."}
{"text":"Wow, today and without expecting it I think I may have eaten the best croissant of the year!!!

I had an appointment at 12.00 and I arrived at King too early, so I found this place and decided to eat something instead of waiting outside. The place is elegant, with nice decoration, nice music and indeed a french bakery feeling. 

I ordered the whole wheat ham and cheese croissant, it had huge ham portions and was full of substance, I mean, look at the pic!!!! I really liked that they offer to warm up the croissant a little bit so that the cheese melts slightly, and they serve it with a tiny salad in what I think was garlic vinagrette sauce. 

Super yummy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Had the croque Monsieur and the mushroom bisque. I think it was around $10 in total. 

I really likes the soup. Lots of mushrooms and a nice broth. Very fresh tasting and the cup seemed like a decent portion. The croque mosieur was very rich with a nice topping of cheese. 

The Atmosphere of the place seems nice but it looks like it gets quite busy for lunch."}
{"text":"After considering about McCafé, decided to try this new bakery since I saw it last time I came. I ordered an apple turnover for 2.50 and asked to have it warmed up. It wasn't that sweet but just good, the Apple filling was so good since it has been warmed up. But I do consider that they use quite a lot of butter to make the pastry. Anyway, this Brioche Doreé is worth a try."}
{"text":"This is a new french style cafe/bakery that just opened up on King West. We're always excited to try new places opening up in the 'hood so we tried them out for lunch on their second day open. I think they're still (understandably) working out the kinks but they have potential.

I got the cream of mushroom soup and a green bean side salad. The soup had an odd sour taste to it and was missing the roll.  I had purposely not bought any of their deliciously looking breads because their menu said a roll was included with soup...so that was rather disappointing (we took our order to go, my fault for not checking before I left - double check your order before you leave!). The green bean side was yummy.

My friend got the tuna sandwich and while it was good, she felt it was not worth the price (over $7!!!).

We also got a piece of basque cake (almond custard pie) and a french-style brownie and shared them.  I liked the pie but I found the brownie a little dry, my friend however liked the brownie (she ate it with her cafe au lait (excellent), so maybe \"french-style brownies\" aren't ment to be eaten on their own?).

I realize they've just opened and their staff is new etc but some things we didn't like:
-the missing roll for my soup :(
-we saw the cashier handle money and then handled tarts without washing hands first
-the smoked salmon for the salad looked old and dry (I was debating getting a big salad with salmon but when I saw that I opted for a side salad instead)
-the weird randomness with which they package their food, our brownie was put in a box but delicate looking fruit tarts were put in bags
-they had plastic spoons for the soup but no forks for the salad

I'm going to call this one average for now.  I've had a lot better but also a lot worse.  We found it a bit pricey for lunch but for coffee and a snack? Totally on par with other cafes.   I think we'll try eating in next time, it does look like a lovely place to sit and have coffee."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich. The interior is very contemporary with plenty of seating options (bench's, communal tables and bar stools) free wifi and even a magazine rack. 

They serve a number of prepared sandwiches from a display case (all were between $7-10) We chose a Ham, Brie and Pear sandwich, which we had heated. You can also choose from a variety of soups and salads, including some pre packaged selections. They seemed overpriced for the portions. We also ordered an almond croissant. 

Both tasted good. The atmosphere and view is good. We sat close to the window with a view on King Street.

They also serve beer and wine. You can't go wrong if you're in the mood for quality eats at a fairly cheap and cheerful prices."}
{"text":"We walked in around 9 AM, and the place was ridiculously busy, and there was only one person working. We had to wait a while to give our orders, the person in front was working super hard to make it in time. They had signs of their breakfast plate and the crepes, but when we walked in they didnt have them, which was a dissapointment. 

We ended up getting crossoint sandwiches and desserts. All were delicious. The coffee was also quite strong, and flavourful, which is how I personally like it. They had very unique variety such as apple and brie and apple and salmon. The croissont was so soft and fresh and the seasoning they used was perfect."}
{"text":"Brioche Dorree is possibly the best pastry shop in the Downtown area! There croissants are fresh, flavourful and much better than chains such as Premiere moisson or Pain doree. Definitely recommend the almond croissant and their liquor products which is a unique product for the area considering its a café. The owners are very kind and take the time to greet and thank customers. The atmosphere is sophisticated with a nice trendy decor. It does get busy during the afternoons! To the 2 reviewers rating this place subpar, i would have to disagree as their pastries are some of the best in Montreal and definitely the best croissants and fresh parisian-style sandwiches you will find in Westmount, with the personal service and quality food products there is no reason not to visit brioche doree if you're in the area."}
{"text":"They close pretty early on a weekday. Was there at 6 and they were putting chairs up at 7 ish. Service was alright but the atmosphere is hip! Their pastries are good lots of selection but price point is high."}
{"text":"Great croissants with reasonably good espresso. Friendly staff. Fast service. Good spot to start your day in a hurry. If you're looking for higher quality espresso, recommend checking out Code Black down the street."}
{"text":"Picked up a sandwich for my daughter. It said mixed vegetables and Goat Cheese and could be toasted, however I requested grilled. 

A small cafe new Metro Hall. Lots of good things on display, but none that I could indulge. It looked good and I picked it up. 

The veggies plenty and perfectly sautéed and seasoned. The Goat Cheese was a disappointing- hardly any. The bread was too chewy and almost bagel consistency. Perhaps grilling or toasting is a bad idea and also to have it right away. 

Interesting looking but had the goat cheese quantity been better it could have knocked out of the park."}
{"text":"Super friendly and the croissant with egg and ham was oh so delicious, very reasonable prices I would go back"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe on Greene ave. The cafe itself is tiny but there are quite a few tables for you to sit with your coffee and catch up with a friend. I dropped by for a chai latte and chocolatine on an early weekday morning and it was already very busy. The service was quick and I grabbed a seat to enjoy my chocolatine and read my book. It's a cozy cafe with a calm atomsphere. The treats are good and their coffee is decent too. I did not try any of their sandwiches or other food options but I am willing to go back and explore. Definitely a nice cafe to check out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"For me, this is a 4x place. Sandwiches are very delicious. Fresh juices are very good and tasty. Very busy at noontime tho. Nevertheless, you can spend a nice time here."}
{"text":"Used to go this chain often in Paris when my parents lived there. Anyway, I was excited to see Brioche Doree on King the other day; I had time to kill so I decided to drop in. It was quite busy with people stopping in to get a coffee for the go. Like the locations in France, they serve sandwiches, salads, treats and coffee based drinks. I'm not sure about WiFi, but there are heaps of outlets around the seating areas so this place would be good for getting work done. I had the Basque Cake and an Americano. Both of which were a-okay. 

Good for: coffee, tea, lunch"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning! They have a nice selection of crepes, sandwiches, and desserts. Really nice and relaxing place if you want to go out for brunch/breakfast without having a sit down meal at a restaurant. Prices are also fair. I paid $8 for a salami sandwich."}
{"text":"Nice place, specializing in pastries. I got the ham and cheese crepe ~$8, which was gooey, soft and comforting"}
{"text":"***Update 9/15/15***
I'm so happy to say that this cute patisserie is as good as it was when we last visited a few years ago. (Nothing's worse than returning to a place that you had a positive experience at to discover it's gone downhill). 

This past summer, we were ignored when we tried to have lunch at the nearby outdoor café at the \"5 Saisons\" so we returned here, to the Brioche Doree, for a casual mid-day meal. The display case was overflowing with enticing wraps and sandwiches and pastries and cakes and breads and palmiers and other cookies and treats. My kids shared a wrap which, though pricey, was large enough for two to share (easily). It came with a small but prettily plated and very fresh salad, which they loved. They also had chocolate croissants which were super fresh and flaky and wonderful. I had a café au lait which is one of my most-missed Montreal pleasures and it was wonderful as well. 

A side note: the washroom here is cute and clean. You can tell a lot about a place by how well kept they keep their bathroom (in my opinion)!

This is a great, unpretentious café with super fresh foods and well-crafted coffees. Good to know we can count on this place."}
{"text":"Returned again and I must say, probably the best croissants and french inspired dessert place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Well isn't this a lovely cafe! Modern, clean, plenty of seating. Most importantly they offer a mouth-watering selection of baked treats, sandwiches, hot bevies and some alcohol!

Prices are reasonable, I picked up an apricot tart for $3. Very tasty! Large soft apricot chunks nuzzled in a baked crust. They also have blueberry, strawberry and lemon tarts! Croissants, muffins, cookies, its a good selection.

I wasn't hungry enough to try their lunches, but the sandwiches looked fresh. The charcuterie platter caught my eye, might come back for that.

I really like this place. There were little candles at each table and an array of seating options. It was quiet with pleasant music in the background. I would come here to meet friends for coffee or for a casual date."}
{"text":"This place is located right by my office which makes it a regular enough haunt. I like it...and don't like it...for different reasons, making it a solid 3. 

The good: The food and coffee here is great: excellent crepes, incredibly light and fluffy with lots of filling. Nice rich americanos too,and a wide selection of pastries and desserts. 

The bad: Way overpriced. Basic pastries are $4-5 and their smoothies are expensive and just FULL of sugar. Unsure if there's any actual fruit in them despite being the \"healthy\" option. 

The average: Service is okay: friendly at times and lax at others. 

Definitely a worthwhile lunch stop (crepes!) but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and lot's of seating. found their baked goods decent. A little pricey for what you get.... I had a cream cheese and blueberry danish with a esspresso, I enjoyed both but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Wifi is shit. They say \"it doesn't work on Macs\", lol. Maybe 3 years ago this was common (to be claimed, there's no technical reason why your wifi shouldn't be set up for any computer). But now in 2014 there's no excuses. 

Especially with all the competition around. Here's every other cafe within a 5 minute walk that have wifi that works - R2, Earlybird, Niche, Jimmy's, Aroma, Thor, Sense Appeal, Leat, oh and Starbucks of course. No OTHER place has this problem - get it together guys, you're last!

I was allowing for growing pains since they opened, but now it's been months. Coffee is slightly better than it used to be. Food is good and healthy.

When you stop being the WORST cafe with wifi in the neighbourhood, this place will deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was really good when we first came here about a week ago, we've been going regularly and the quality is sometimes hit and miss.

This review is based on our recent visit.  The tuna sandwiches are really good, they are on a small brioche bun but pretty expensive for $7.50 considering it's really small.

Today was the straw that broke the camel's back, there was barely any tuna in there.  I'm not joking, and the bun was smaller than usual...Is that even possible???!?

They have this really nice egg bread, I don't know what it's called but it's awesome...today it was half the size it usually is.  What's going on?

At these exuberant prices, I'd venture to go elsewhere...quickly, lest you change your mind when you smell the sweet scent of baked goods...Hurry!"}
{"text":"Visited this place about 3 times and the pastries I've tried are just alright... Definitely not worth the price. Haven't tried their sandwiches though"}
{"text":"très ravissante la Brioche dorée!!!
hummm j'adore!!!"}
{"text":"I loved their chocolate cookie! So different  and fun and tasty! Yes, this review is only about a single cookie. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Pleasant place inside, but they do not offer wifi. Pastries are average and pricey. Latte is pretty good though, so the two stars are for that. 
Staff is not welcoming and don't  look very pleasant. No eye contact from the beginning to the end. They do not show prices, so that's kind of annoying. Other customers were asking about their prices too. A lady was trying to order something, but the employee would go and wash things instead of helping her till the end. Come on, that's so unprofessional! And it wasn't even busy. But that must be a Westmount thing. I find people very miserable here."}
{"text":"Pros: tasty, high quality
Cons: expensive, small portions

Went there with ~12 people for lunch.  

When you walk in you choose what you want from the side and pay on the spot.  Then you go to your table and eat.  

Food: I got a Smoked Chicken sandwich - it came out to just over $9.  The sandwich came with a full strip of bacon, was warmed to perfection to made the cheese melted.
After I ate the sandwich I was still hungry.  

Locale: The place is pretty small, for a late lunch the place was full, we barely managed to find space to sit us all.  The whole locale could sit approx. 40 people. 

Not great for large groups, but good for a few ppl. meeting up for a small bite to eat."}
{"text":"I had their King St location bookmarked, but never made it down there and now, I may not hafta wait until my next trip downtown!

This Brioche Dorée location opened up at the end of October and is located inside Sherway Gardens.  It took over the old Michel's Baguette...which I don't think exists in this mall anymore.  Then again, is there even a difference between Brioche Vs. Michel's?  Not really.

I grabbed an Apricot danish while I was at the mall, but didn't really get to eat it until a coupla hours afterwards.  Still good, maybe not as flaky as it was when it was initially purchased.  Around ~$3, so expected price for such a pastry.

Would definitely stop by again to check out their other pastries, but honestly, not a drastic diff from Michel's."}
{"text":"I had the basics (a croissant and a latte) but I would definitely return. There were oh so many things I wanted to try and if the croissant was any indication the quality is promising. Not the best criossant I've ever had, but better than most.
Awesome atmosphere here though; I felt like I had stepped into another life!"}
{"text":"During our week visit in Montreal we used it to supplement our breakfast with some baked goods and coffee. The plain croissant is excellent, so is the spinach bistro. Chocolate croissant is ok. Coffee is ok too. We also tried two salads,the cucumber and the potatoes, neither worth having. Lovely attentive service."}
{"text":"The decaf nonfat caffe latte to go was disappointing. There was no foam and the flavor of the beans didn't stand out. It cost around $5 which is the standard price these days. 

I didn't get food but the baked goods looked good and I've had one of their croissants about 6 months ago and it was quite flaky and good. 

The ambience is nice too, to do some work on your laptop, people watch if you're sitting at the window, or to meet a friend or a first date.

I wouldn't go out of my way to get my coffee from here or pastries. But if in the neighborhood and wanting to stay east of Bathurst I might pop in."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Very cool little cafe in the downtown area. The patrons are young and a variety of styles. Regardless, you will be comfortable inside. 

Food: Great food items like croissants and sandwiches. Everything was great. I went here for breakfast with my wife. We both had croissants. The coffee and hot chocolate were also good. 

Service: Great service, very nice. I speak very little French and they were patient."}
{"text":"Was here for brunch, we sat on the patio, the quiche are ok, I would suggest the salmon if any.
The salads are great specifically the beet and goats cheese.
The croissants and other desserts are lovely.
I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick latte, or tea and some pastries. Also, had delicious sandwiches. My cafe mocha was very good, as was my almond chocolate croissant. Cutest little cafe, seems to be where locals go as well."}
{"text":"Almost everything is good here but their service really sucks. No smiles, no greeting just robotic line movers. I don't need a song and dance but is it hard to offer customer service in the form of being friendly?

I got a sandwich and soup combo + a chocolate croissant for about $13. Everything was good but the croissant. Hardly any chocolate in there!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! It's in such a cute and trendy neighborhood. My friend and I happened to walk by and stop in for brunch. The Cafe Mocha is so delicious, one of the best I have ever had. The croissant was fresh and delicious. The carmelized onion quiche was delicious. I had this ham sandwich thing with cheese on the bread too (sounds greedy but I wanted to try everything!) and it was a little different but good. I didn't eat the bottom part with the mayo. 

Service was good. Very casual. Overall a very cute little place. Wish they had them by me. Very Parisian and chic."}
{"text":"3.5 not more

The croissants and pains au chocolat are really not so bad although not chewy enough on the inside.  
What i really don't like is the poorly planned seating area with communal tables and ugly chairs.  To me, it has an airport atmosphere and clearly you don't want to share a table with overweight Bridget Jones-like girls who believe they're having a French immersive experience by eating there.  
Take away your food."}
{"text":"L'ancien \"Au Pain Dorée\" est devenu \"La Brioche Dorée\", même compagnie française. /// Jolie petite boulangerie relooké sur St-Laurent, sandwichs, salades, viennoiseries, cafés, comptoir intérieur pour manger sur place + comptoir extérieur sur la rue pour emporter (lattés, croissants,...). Les prix sont corrects comme leur compétiteurs mais pourraient être plus abordables (ex: sandwich 7,50$). Wifi gratuit + journaux/magazines sur place."}
{"text":"It ok nothing special ,this place was sold 1.5 years ago , unfortunately new owner don't know how operate this business , he let go all the employees to keep the operating cost down, I see many people goes there to buy a croissant since there is only 1 employe it takes forever to pay so people don't wait and leave,plus the new owners ( wife and husband ) not very friendly they dint speak any English so they can't  communicate properly , To my opinion they should open up a business in more french area rather than Westmount , I hope iam wrong but I don't think this place will last , yes it's a nice location yes they have nice interior to sit and have coffee or lunch yes it's comphortable yes decor is decent but food sucks, before the new owners came they had nice homemade Italian hot food but now it's like a hospital food , anyways I wish the best for the owners

{"text":"Love this place!!! Great food, great decor, excellent service and very good location. You go there, and it's not like those other restaurants/coffee places. Even if \"Brioche dorée\" is a chain, the owners designed the whole place. They did it with taste and a lot of chic! And speaking of taste: the food!!! Extremely tasty. And the variety! You could literally go a few times a week and never have the same thing. Today I tried this new wrap, it's like a sushi wrap...wow! Owners and staff are great and make you feel like family. Just go, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a smoked salmon bagel because apparently that's what Montreal is known for. Meh, I've definitely had better elsewhere in other cities. The bagel wasn't as fresh as I would have liked and overall just super mediocre."}
{"text":"Comme une bonne Française que je suis, je retrouve mes repères chez Brioche Dorée. Cette chaîne française de restauration rapide a parfaitement importé son savoir-faire outre-Atlantique. Ils sont précis sur les cuissons, les assaisonnements, et bien sûr les goûts. L'équilibre entre le beau et le bon est respecté. Bref, j'adhère."}
{"text":"Looks nice, but that's it. The only dough prepared on the premises is the pizza dough, and not all the time. The other breads are shipped in and heated as required (all this from an employee there - fair enough, so no fresh dough). The selection, however, seems rather unimpressive. The absolute worst part, though, were gnats and a few insects flying/crawling over the breads (uncovered, next to the cash register). Under no circumstances should there be insects, especially unnoticed by staff, on my prospective food purchase, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was a little surprised when I first stepped into Brioche Doree, because I thought it was more of a sit-down restaurant, but instead it was more of a coffee shop/cafe setup, where you order your food at the counter and then bring it over to the seated area yourself. They have a good selection of breakfast, brunch and lunch items, such as various pastries, sandwiches, quiches, crepes, soups, and salads. I ordered a ham and cheese crepe and thought it was quite satisfying - they don't make them on the spot for you, but have them in a case and then warm them up. They do lunch combos where you can add a side salad to your sandwich/crepe/quiche and it'll come out to around $9. Overall the food here is good, but I think for the coffee shop/cafe kind of setup it's pretty pricey, as my lunch + a bottle of orange juice came up to like $12-$13."}
{"text":"Seems like the food is going downhill. I used to come here for lunch, either for their sandwiches or salads I was raving about, but portion sizes has gotten smaller and I no longer find their food as satisfying and definitely no longer worth the value.
The procuitto sandwich doesn't have the same quantity of meat and the bread has decreased in size, it was also inconsistently assembled.
The salads are noticeably smaller and I find it no longer a decent sized meal.

I now go across the street to Forno for their procuitto sandwich which is now my favorite sandwich. Though it is Italian-styled rather than French, it is definitely a sandwich to have if you are craving procuitto and much more substantial and tastes great for the same price."}
{"text":"good selection of pasteries. Love this place great selection of sandwiches! It's tiny so going when it's crowded is not a good idea! Love love the selection of food!"}
