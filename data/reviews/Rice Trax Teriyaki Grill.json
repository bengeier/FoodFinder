{"text":"Maybe it's because of the 5 star ratings that this place hasn't improved, and  I hate to be so against the grain but, I must speak the truth.

Pros: Hands down, the BEST mochiko chicken in Las Vegas.   The girls are always friendly, no matter how many things are off the menu that day.

Cons: Every time I walk in to this establishment, something is \"out.\"  Be it the pork for fried rice, or the macaroni salad...there is no excuse for anything to be \"out\" at a \"Hawaiian Food\" establishment. 

Also, their fried rice seasoning blend has 'dashi' in it, which has MSG.  No wonder it's so yummy! It doesn't bother me, but for some it might.  

Items being out is definitely an issue of poor prep.  If you want char siu in your fried rice, go down the street where they are never out of pork.  Also, a  claimed 'Hawaiian Food' establishment should NEVER be out of mac salad.  I'm not even sure if you can call this place a Hawaiian Food establishment.  

I'm not denying this place has good food...when they have everything in stock that is."}
{"text":"Yummy! Best brown fried rice I ever tasted! Clean friendly staff"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Went earlier this week and had to wait 15 minutes for my food.  Other customers were there for over 20 minutes, so unorganized.  I go tonight and they are closed due to having no food.  They need to get better management or this place shut down."}
{"text":"Rice Trax is great for when you need something fast and easy.  It's a pretty small place but I'm sure it's more of a take-out place since the food was served in take-out containers.  It was empty when I went but don't be afraid! The food is good, and I normally don't like this kind of food.  I ordered the garlic bento box and there was a LOT of food for the price.  Enough for a second meal, easy.  The service was very quick and the people were very nice.

I will definitely be back again to try out more of their menu."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for the new location to open, so i could finally try it.  I was too lazy to drive to Jones. LOL!  I didn't really enjoy it.  My fried rice was extremely oily and the rice was hard and undercooked.  Great idea with the salad bar to choose what you want in the fried rice, but bad execution.  Maybe I'll give it another try in a month or two."}
{"text":"CLEAN!!!
Great food, menu is simple but offers a lot of variety/options.  My first visit here and wow!  The cost is very reasonable too."}
{"text":"We were extremely excited to find out that Rice Trax was finally re-opening after many months of waiting. However, when we ordered out favorite bentos, we were GREATLY disappointed. Gone were the chicken katsu on the stick...gone were the teriyaki steak on the stick...gone were the large shrimp tempura. Rice Trax's portions SHRANK. It wasn't enjoyable anymore. I miss the ambiance of the smaller restaurant. It was more inviting and felt like a mom and pop store. Rice Trax has lost it's uniqueness. Rice Trax has turned into every other local Hawaiian place like L&L, Ohana Hawaiian BBQ and Island Sushi. I don't think we'll return any time soon. SO DISAPPOINTED!!!"}
{"text":"Always pleased with Rice Trax!
My girlfriend and I always passed Rice Trax, and finally gave it a whirl after coming across a coupon.  We weren't too sure what to expect, as other Asian grill-style places in the area have been \"so-so.\" But we were pleasantly surprised - we were starving and Rice Trax def delivered!!! First of all the place was super-clean, staff was helpful in explaining the menu options, and the food was AWESOME!  
The fact that you get to design your own rice bowl - with meat, 3 veggies, rice style, and sauce- is fantastic!!!  The skewered grilled chicken and grilled beef are awesome - lean but tender!  Rice is great and veggies look bright and fresh!!!
We have been back several times and will continue to make frequent visits in the future - coupon or not - LOL!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!! Love kimchi fried rice + 4 skewers!! HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"I wasn't in the mood to cook last night so I decided to try out Rice Trax.  I had purchased a Group-on last year, but never used it.  I decided to pick up a Garlic Bento and a Mochiko Bento ($8.95) so that my bf could choose which one he wanted.  The Garlic Bentro came with 3 pieces of garlic chicken (deep fried chicken in sauce), 2 beef skewers, 1 hot dog, 2 slices of spam, 2 pieces of sweet potato tempura, green salad and furikake rice.  The Mochiko bento came with little pieces of mochiko chicken, 2 skewers of chicken katsu, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura, green salad and furikake rice.  Very yummy.  I will visit again especially since it's about 3 minutes away from home."}
{"text":"This is my second experience with this place and it seems like it's just getting better every time I go.

I ordered the Furikake Bento today (1st time was the Mochiko). Service was A+. The cashier was very friendly and even reminded me about my nifty little punch card I had received the first time. Had she not done that, I have such a bad memory, I would have forgotten to take advantage of it. I placed my order \"to go\" and waited patiently for my food. It didn't take too long before I was heading out the door with my bag of goodies.

On to the food... it was delightfully delicious! The Furikake Bento came with fried rice (3 toppings of your choice - I chose red onions, green onions, and peas), furikake shrimp skewers, teriyaki beef skewers, teriyaki chicken and salad. The shrimp was crunchy and slightly seasoned. Every bite was addicting. The teriyaki beef reminded me of my family's marinade recipe, lightly seasoned with a nice kick of pepper and a sweet touch to it. What a wonderful throwback of a memory! The chicken teriyaki didn't seem like it had much flavor but they throw in a cup of some spicy cream based sauce and once you dip it in there, it definitely gives it a nice tangy bite. Again, the fried rice was perfect. I tasted the garlic, onions, and the sweetness of the peas. Mmm, even now I'm reliving on these splendid flavors on my taste buds as I write this review. Excuse me while I clean the drool of my keyboard...

The most wonderful part about going there is that they give you a ton of food. I can eat one bento box for two meals and feel full each time. It's about $12 for a box, but I see myself being a regular there at least once a week, contributing my hard earned money to this fine establishment. On top of that, I still have two more bento boxes to try so you will definitely be reading my reviews on those soon."}
{"text":"Two words: Chicken Katsu! 

Wow after reading all the reviews on this place I finally decided to check it out. If you like local grindz (Hawaiian food), definitely give this place a try. I ordered the mochiko chicken bento with kimchi fried rice, and whew I was struggling to get through it but I didn't want to stop eating. You definitely get what you pay for! 

I enjoyed the bento because you pretty much got to sample all the meats and had a choice of what type of rice you wanted. I will say that the chicken katsu was awesome. It had a crispy batter and moist inside so the chicken was not dry. Screw Raising Cane's, I think I'll go to Rice Trax when I have a craving for chicken fingers! The kimichi fried rice was also enjoyable but not as spicy as I would have liked, thank goodness for Sriracha! The teri beef skewer was tender and easy to eat! Sorry Mochiko but you were overpowered by Katsu!

I would definitely be back to try some other combos. I do like the fact that it is a create your own fried rice. Yes you get charged for additional toppings outside of the 4 meat skewers & 3 veggies, and your own sauce but really who needs that many toppings? Plus for those that are health conscious, they do offer white or brown rice so that's always a plus! The decor isn't anything fancy or amazing so I would suggest take-out. The cashier was friendly and helped us through the ordering process."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, especially on fast food restaurants, however \"Rice Trax\" is worth it.  my family and i travel across town at least once a week to eat at this wonderfully new restaurant.  They have really, really good fried rice, but i always order the tempura fried rice.  They have awesome tempura!!!  Better than a lot of sushi houses here in town and much more affordable.  Their prices are excellent for the amount of food that you get!  A definite \"must try\" place!"}
{"text":"Food was really good .... 
New building kinda no good ....
U pay extra for everything ....
Miss the old restaurant on jones ...."}
{"text":"The food was so Ono!  Aloha style service!! We'll be visiting again on our next run to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great bentos and lots of options. The garlic chicken and Kim-Chee fried rice are my favorites. The garlic chicken is moist inside with a crispy crust and a tasty sauce. Also try their Mochiko chicken and various tempuras. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, they relatively inexpensive bentos considering they have huge portions that are easily customizable. (Can't beat an average of $10 per bento!) On the other hand, I always eat more that I should here and because the food is so heavy I end up regretting it in the end. They have preset combinations but I always make my own. You can do a 2 item or 3 item combo and each comes with your selection of rice, your chosen entrees, Mac salad, and 2 sauces. The garlic chicken, mochiko chicken and furikake shrimp are stand outs in the menu. You can choose their house fried rice, white rice, brown rice, or make your own. The kimchi friend rice is one of their offerings and it had a pretty good flavor but it's way too oily/greasy.

They take a long time to prepare/cook your food so order ahead and take it to-go."}
{"text":"Saw a sign in front of their location on Jones saying they will be moving to Rainbow around June 3. It's 2 days before July. I tried calling them and left message but no one calls back??  I hope they are still in business. Does anyone know what's going on??"}
{"text":"I can't believe they have been open for a year, and I never heard of it , until today:)!! Finally a bento like they have in Hawaii .
      Garlic bento -garlic chix, teri beef, spam , hot dog ,sweet potato tempura and mac salad.
       The garlic chix was crispy and flavorful as was the  teri beef sticks. 
        Mochiko bento- mochiko chix , teri beef , chicken katsu, shrimp tempura and mac salad  - This is my favorite the mochiko chix was cut into little pieces so the marinade soaked through. The chicken katsu was on a stick , first time ive seen this very impressed , the shrimp tempura was a nice touch.   
           Mac salad is an extra .50 charge, but worth it.
    Both bento's had alot of food and looked really good like someone cared.  Someone in the kitchen, I'm pretty sure actually cooked in Hawaii, because the flavors and presentation was spot on.   I wish I found  Rice Trax sooner , I have a lot of catching up to do !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Choose your vegetables and let them take care the rest. Good food!!!"}
{"text":"So far the best Tempura shrimp I found in town! Bento Boxes are a great  delicious deal too."}
{"text":"Mochiko chicken and chicken katsu is the best. Love that I can make brown rice, fried rice."}
{"text":"This place is going to make me fat.  SO GOOD.

Rice Trax seems to specialize in the Hawaiian plate and damn do they have some good ones.  I ordered the katsu curry plate while my boyfriend tried the mochiko.  The katsu curry plate includes a huge glob of white rice, a large helping of katsu chicken pieces, macaroni salad, and salad.  The katsu was crispy and the curry had a nice kick.  The macaroni salad was flavored nicely-- meaning it didn't just taste like mayonnaise.  Brown rice is an option...so...that'll make it healthier, right? Right?

The mochiko bento, however, is my favorite so far. It includes tasty, crispy nuggets of unbreaded chicken along with beef Teriyaki, chicken katsu on a stick, rice and two large pieces of shrimp tempura.  Yes, the mochiko bento should be included in \"This is Why Your Fat.\"   So greasy and om nom.

The restaurant isn't fancy but you can have the Vegas al fresco dining experience (aka eating at tables in the strip mall parking lot).  I'll be back to continue my trajectory to heart attack city."}
{"text":"After seeing my friend's posts on Facebook, I decided to check it out for myself. I could see why they were ranting and raving about this place! I ordered a garlic bento, which comes with your choice of fried rice, 2 pieces of...garlic chicken, Teri beef, spam, hot dogs & sweet potato tempura! Need I say more? This was enough to satisfy the biggest Hawaiian appetite! Last but not least, they have my fave dessert, tempura ice cream!! The food was cooked to perfection and tasted as good as it looked!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant to me, so decided to try it out.  They have a counter where you can order take out and a sit down service.  My understanding is that they just started the sit-down service a few days ago and have added new entrees to the regular menu.  I had the Furikake Salmon with brown rice which was delicious.  Another person in our group had the Shoyu Chicken, which he said was the best he's ever had.  The Katsu-don was just \"awesome\"!  The girls who served us were very friendly and attentive.  The Hawaiian music playing in the background, the pictures of Hawaii and the shirts that the girls wore made you think that just for that moment you were back in Hawaii.  Great food, nice ambience, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very Friendly Staff, Big Portions, and Food is tasty what more could you ask for from a restaurant.   This place is great and I can't wait until next time I travel to Vegas to try the Garlic Bento Box."}
{"text":"Food as pretty good. Ordered Kimchee fried rice and garlic chicken. Kimchee fried rice was pretty good ( but i make way better ) The garlic chicken's batter was a little too thick for me. Would've given it four stars but the service was lacking. I told the woman at the counter that it was my first time here and came after reading the good reviews on yelp. She barely acknowledged that i even spoke. whatever...anyway I asked for a side order of kimchi and she said it was not for sale and they only used it to make their fried rice. I actually thought she was kidding but when I got home..no side of kimchi! Really? Well it was a little far for me anyway but now they have lost me for sure."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local food restaurants to fill our local/Hawaiian cravings.  Being born and raised in Hawaii, my husband and I always try to find restaurants that remind of us of home and this one does.  They expanded their menu from being a fried rice bar with bentos to adding many of the local favorites like saimin, beef stew, katsu with brown gravy or curry and much more! Today we went and learned that you can dine in with servers and its been 1 week since they started this... Also they open on Monday's! Thank you for bringing the island flavors to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I live right down the street to their current location and eat here at least once a week. The food is great quality and they offer a nice variety of options. The people that work there are very friendly and accommodating to my special order because I have allergies. They are moving to a different location on Rainbow soon and I'll be sad it's not next door like it is now! But I will make the 3 minute drive when they move :)"}
{"text":"Onolicious! My son heard about this place from his cousin and so we went on an adventure to find it.  Although it's a distance from his house, we made the trek and am so glad we did! The portions are huge! The food will absolutely \"brok da mout\"! All of the food descriptions are on the money as far as what to expect!  Everything was superb!  The staff were pleasant and friendly!  Mahalo nui loa!"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write my first ever yelp review because I want this establishment to succeed and be around for a long, long time.  I wanted to reinforce pretty much what all the other reviewers have already posted about how great this place is.   A friend of mine told me about this place and I can't believe I passed it so many times!  It's family owned by people from Hawaii and they really know what locals in Las Vegas are looking for in a plate lunch/bento.  

The food is fresh, tasty, plentiful and inexpensive.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, on the menu is delicious and flavorful.  It is not a huge menu and they are better off for that because whatever they make is good.  The seating and decor is clean and nondescript.  The counter service is friendly and efficient.  You simply cannot ask for anything more.

The shrimp tempura, chicken katsu curry, garlic chicken and mochiko chicken are the best in town for take-out joints.

I may write a review for Poke Express too because it's another fantastic eatery that is family owned by friendly folks from Hawaii."}
{"text":"The Mochiko chicken is some of the best I've ever had. Very friendly staff. Love the rice, made to order on the spot! Very easy to find. Great location. Food gets out quick. You'll spend a out $20 for two people.....totally worth every penny."}
{"text":"Mochiko bento with kimchee fried rice ftw... katsu skewer so moist and ono and mochiko chicken hit the spot... kimchee fried rice made on the spot broke da mout... my new fave Hawaiian food joint..."}
{"text":"Kim chee fried rice is tasty! Came here for a late lunch one day with some friends even though I had already eaten. This is why I'm fat! I can't resist trying out new places. Seeing all the assorted tempuras and skewers had me salivating. I ended up nibbling off my boyfriend's bento box which consisted of teriyaki chicken, beef, and tempura shrimp on top of kim chee fried rice and a side of salad. The meats were juicy and full of flavor. And you could add even more flavor to them with the dipping sauce you choose upon ordering.

Everything is customizable here and you can pretty much create your own fried rice or rice plate. There are also plenty of sides and a la carte items to choose from.

Be warned though, this place reeks of grease/food and the smell will set into your clothes/hair if you decide to eat there :( Next time, I'll try the garlic bento box to-go!"}
{"text":"This location is moving to 7765 S. Rainbow!!!! Soo excited right by my house! They have stamp cards too!!!

Every time I go here I'm impressed! I get brown rice kimchi fried rice with red onion, zucchini, and jalapenos!!!!! I also sometimes get the tempura fried veggies but I'm warning you...IT'S A LOT OF FOOD FOR ONE PERSON LOL! You could really split this combo between two people.

I must confess right now that I have never asked if the kimchi is vegan :X I really need to ask if it has a fish sauce in it. Otherwise I'm pretty sure this combo is vegan :))))))))

I can't wait until it moves from Jones to Rainbow because I can basically walk to it :) How dangerous is that? 

It's super good and the owners? the people that work there are very nice.

I plan to host a UYE as soon as it opens on Rainbow in there new beautiful building!"}
{"text":"What a yummy find!

You can create your own bento or choose from their pre-made choices. I opted for Mochiko Bento & the bf chose Furikake Bento. 

Let me start off by saying, oh my goodness, the portions are ridiculous! They are so generous! No, really. Like I could share a bento with someone and we would both still be super full. 

Anyway, you can choose white, brown or fried rice. Fried rice has an upcharge of like $1.25 or something. Kinda pricey, I know, but I wanted to try it. They ask what veggies  & I just chose peas, carrots and corn.  It was tasty. Not the best fried rice but I liked it. It needed more flavor though. Like somekindof seasoning. Maybe garlic salt? I like egg on my fried rice too so that's another negative thing.

Mochiko chicken was more on the salty side & I usually have mochiko more on the sweet side. I liked the chicken katsu on the stick. Dipped it in the Teri sauce and sweet chili and aioli sauces (all free btw, just ask); they were all good condiments! Teriyaki steak was tender and not chewy. Boyfriend loved his bento too. He finished all his shrimp and Mac salad! I did not even touch the house salad. I just wasn't a fan of it at all.

All in all, portions were definitely very generous, food was tasty but watch out, price can rack up if you add extra things."}
{"text":"Great find, came here on the suggestion of a co-worker, and now can't go 2 weeks without coming back.  Its all just so good.  I can't do without the macaroni salad and the portions are so big when coming for lunch there is always enough left over for dinner too."}
{"text":"I love rice trax! With the convenience of the location just being right across from my place, I tend to go here to get my quick jap fix. I normally get the garlic or mochiko bento w/ kimchee fried rice. Rice is a must try!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 4.5 stars if I could. The only thing that's stopping me from giving it 5 is that it is kind of pricey. A bento is ~$10 depending on what you get. But you do get your money's worth because the portions size is pretty large and the bento combos come with plenty of food. It's just that I'd rather pay less for less food than more money for food that may not get finished. But that's just me.

Anyways, I got the Mochiko bento which came with Mochiko chicken, salad, rice, shrimp tempura, chicken katsu, and beef skewers. Like I said, it's plenty of food that also tastes good. I particularly liked the chicken Katsu. There was something about the flaky breading that made it taste better. Their rice comes with furikake which was nice too. This place is worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"New location is finally open!!! I called yesterday around 4:30pm to see if it was open & guess what?? It was!!! So I got in my car & drove down to Rainbow & Robindale. Just my luck, it was closed by the time I got there, 5:30pm. What the hell??? My heart was shattered. There was a sign on the door that read, \"Sold Out\". :'( So, I made sure to call my order ahead today :p Bomb I tell you! (Except for the teryaki beef) teryaki chicken & breaded shrimp are on point! :) The fried rice was perfect!"}
{"text":"The flavors here are just perfectly right !  I was literately craving this place the next day but waited till the following weekend and again had the best bento ever. I was never a fan of chicken katsu until now but my favorite item is the furikake shrimp with the most unique dipping sauce. Can't wait to try the rest of their items!"}
{"text":"A good alternative to Aloha Kitchen and L&L if you are craving Hawaiian Japanese food!

Ordered the mochiko bento with brown rice and mac salad- it was TONS of food. Couldn't finish it.. had the rest for breakfast the next day! Meal cost about $9.00+ .. Word of advice- not the place to go if you are trying to diet :-P

I would def come back and try out there other bentos..!"}
{"text":"To good to write much, to busy munching on great FOOD!!!!!! Love the service and amount of food given! wow. love it."}
{"text":"Glad I finally stopped by this place because now I can get my plate lunch fix close to home!  Mahalos Rice Trax!

Been there a few times, mochiko combo w/Kim chee fried rice the first time... Ono!  Second time was the bento with furikake shrimp... And they don't hold back, you definitely get your money's worth here. Ordered it with pork fried rice the second time, enjoyed that more.  Chicken Katsu they make on skewers and it's some of the juciest I've had, good stuff.  Sugar bites are like mini malasadas with cinnamon or sugar.

Took my dad here when he visited from HI, very picky about his fried rice and needless to say we picked up 3 times when he was here for a week.

They also just started a frequent visit card thing, good thing because I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Trying to give RiceTrax a fair shot but 3 of the 5 times I've been to their new location they've run out of pork for their fried rice. Never really ran into that problem at their old location so maybe they're adjusting to the new location/demand and running out??  

I won't be back for a while, probably call to ask if they've run out of pork before I do. Seems like a weird thing to have to do at a place known for their fried rice.

I've brought friends and family here, kinda sad its not the same."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and the food both times has been amazing. We always get the rice traxx bento which comes with rice, sausage, spam, garlic chicken, tempura sweet potato and marinated grilled beef. The beef is really tender and the marinade comes across like Korean bugogi. They also serve a \"Korean\" sauce option that sweet and savory and is my current favorite. The main event here at rice traxx though is the fried rice. You start by selecting from a wide range of veggies then choose your rice (they have brown for us health nuts), next up what sort of protein and how you want it prepared and then finally the sauce. It's fun experimenting with new combos and different flavors. I have gotten the grilled items and they are always tender and a little smoky. The best dish for me was the garlic chicken. These are huge pieces of fried chicken coated in a sweet salty garlic sauce and are best described ad fried chicken boulders. I love em! For dessert we had the tempura ice cream which had a crisp outside of tempura batter and rich ice cream inside. Get it, you won't be sorry. This place would so be a five but the inside is a little....basic. Throw a plant somewhere or something, but that being said the food here is the star of the show...that and the fun of creating your own rice dish."}
{"text":"Awesome! Best Hawaiian grub in town. Low prices, quality food and chill atmosphere make this mom&pop restaurant a 5 star. I am sad that they will be moving soon, but at least it will still be in the neighborhood. I have yet to try more dishes. However I love their house salad, macaroni salad, chicken Katsu, chicken skewers, Machiko bento & beef teriyaki. I have yet to try everything else. But I soon will be :)"}
{"text":"1 star off the bat for
location.. kinda hidden from the masses, but great for the neighborhood! :P 

we finally had take out for lunch from this cool new establishment around the corner, and I'm really glad that we did!  I was a little under the weather and my appetite was super annoying.. but I did enjoy it.

my plate had [1] beef, [1] shrimp, and [1] chicken skewer, and a lot of kim chee fried rice. [I like my fried rice either sticky or not to moist.. and their rice was sticky but halfway to moist.. ] it was decent..

the beef was so tender!! of the three.. the beef was my fav.  the chicken was juicy, and the shrimp was flavorful.  

 when my husband first opened it up, he was afraid that the beef & chicken wasn't going to be enough for him.. but it was.  we had a LOT of rice left over. 

I have yet to actually see the place and eat there... but after trying it for the first time and being totally satisfied, I'm sure it won't be long till I do!"}
{"text":"Mochiko chicken was pretty good, fried shrimp was a little bland, fried purple potatoes were really good but you only get 3 little pieces when you order as a side. Fried rice was pretty good. Definitely a must when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Simply the best place I've eaten at in Vegas. I will be back and back and back for more. 

Don't be fooled that it is a generic looking Teriyaki place in a strip mall. The food is FRESH and it is awesome. I will break my diet and eat carbs just for Rice Trax. 

It's a local joint that seemed to have a loyal following. Thank you Yelp for helping me find this great establishment."}
{"text":"Garlic chicken is the best thing here. My girl and I shared two meals to go and the best thing I ate was the garlic chicken by far. The next day I was craving it again. I just can't get enough of the stuff."}
{"text":"if ur craving mitsuken style garlic chicken...u'll be disappointed. other then that, the mochiko chicken and katsu curry was delish. next time, we're trying the fried rice."}
{"text":"When I'm craving some garlic chicken, Rice Trax is my go to place.  For starters, the serving size of their boxes are huge, it reminds me of the plate lunches back in Hawai`i.  Compared to other places in Vegas, I don't mind paying $10 for the amount of food that you get that actually tastes ono!"}
{"text":"This place is the rice equivalent of Subway: choose your rice (white or brown), meat, and 3 veggies and the cook will fry it all up for you.  I elected to have brown fried rice with grilled chicken and veggies (red and yellow peppers and carrots).  Decent portion size and tasty.  Instead of being fried with the rice and veggies, the chicken comes on a skewer and is accompanied by your choice of dipping sauce (I chose Korean sauce).  Hubby got the garlic bento box (assortment of meats and rice) and actually finished the lot (pig!).  Impressive, considering the amount of food!

The joint is small and nondescript, situated in a little strip mall on Jones.  While the food was very good, the floors and tables were a bit sticky, which distracted me a bit from the yummy food.  

I may not choose to eat in next time, but would definitely consider takeaway, next time I want fried rice."}
{"text":"I will definitely update if I ever get a chance to actual try this place. Last time at their old location they were closed randomly during normal operating hours. Today they were \"out of food\" so they were closed. Not much I can say except maybe we were never meant to eat here ^-^ lol"}
{"text":"I know been too long since update cause totally slacking on my Bento Action! Instead of going with the make your own went with one of Bento combinations on the menu. I got the Furikake Bento. Updated review let me add bringing back the Furikake not that I don't get enough at home. It kind of like Spam if your local from da islands you know certain things that go with rice. Furikake is one of them!!! The Furikake Shrimp was awesome! It basically shrimp tempura with nice light panko breading style not greasy or heavy. They toss it with the Furikake seasoning. The shrimp is nice most and hot on the inside. It first time ordered the Furikake Shrimp definitely not my last time! They were so addicting could have whole Bento of it. =)) Two other entree was the teriyaki chicken and the teriyaki beef. I had both before and still right on point. I enjoy the fact that everything comes on screws. It makes easy too eat, not so messy, and leaves more room for rice. Forget too mention Furikake on rice. Seriously can never have enough of the good things in life. The house salad (instead of mac salad) really enjoy. The greens are nice fresh, crispy, and like the house dressing comes on top of it. Plus they don't drown the salad with the dressing. Whatever the dipping sauce they give you with the Furikake Shrimp is da bomb. 

In the need for Bento at reasonable price really no other spot would go in town. Looking forward too my next Bento!!!!"}
{"text":"I finally passed by Rice Trax when they were open but I had just left a UYE only a few minutes before. So my excuse for stopping was I had to bring some food home for everyone else.

I ordered a couple of Mochiko and Furikake bentos. I know I just ate but it smelt so good on the ride home that I had to sample some. The best part of the Mochiko bento were the big pieces of chicken katsu and shrimp tempera.  The best part Furikake bento were the furikake shrimp and dipping sauce.  

So delicious, Rice Trax has some of the best bentos in Vegas definitely. I still haven't had their fried rice I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is top knotch and happy, friendly service will keep me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"After reading a lot of great reviews and seeing check-in after check-in by my friends, I decided to check this place out. I probably would've checked it out a lot sooner had it not been for the fact that it's kind of out of the way from my house, but better late than never! I came here with my parents and ordered the Furikake Bento and the Mochiko Bento. I was first surprised by the inexpensiveness of their bentos (8.95) and the variety of the items included in each. When our order arrived, I was again pleasantly surprised by the amount of food! Their portions are pretty big! 

Being that it was my first time, I didn't stray too far with the substitution options they had. While the substitutions have an additional price, (i.e. kimchi fried rice, macaroni salad) it is good to note that they have options--Especially for the health conscious individuals. 

One downside I did find was that I left the place smelling of food. While I'm sure it is hard to ventilate a small place with an open kitchen that prepares their food the way they do, you might not want to dine in unless you plan for others to smell everything you ate on your clothes. Thank goodness for TO-GO!"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Rice Trax but almost forgot about going there because of where they were previously located. I'm excited that they moved, a block closer to me and a lot easier to get to for everyone else. I'm loving the new digs a lot more, near businesses like Oyshi and Soyo on Rainbow and Robindale.

Vegas has a few decent bento places but nothing else really like Rice Trax. They raised their prices about $0.50 more from what I remembered. The bentos are now about $10 with big portions and lots of taste. My favorite is the Furikake Bento probably because it came with furikake shrimp, pieces of golden fried shrimp with furikake a mixture of sesame seeds and seaweed.  It also comes with their house salad which is their tastiest item, teriyaki beef and chicken, rice, and a delicious dipping sauce.

Most recently, basically today, I had the Mochiko Bento.  It came with mochiko chicken, its a lot like popcorn chicken but using mochiko flour, kind of oily and gummy I didn't like it a lot. It also came with large pieces of chicken katsu, a couple pieces of shrimp tempura, skewered teriyaki beef, rice, and more of that tasty house salad. It was a lot of fried oily food but good tasting food.

You can also create your own 3 items and 2 items bentos from any of the items they have listed and create your own fried rice by choosing items from their fried rice bar.

Their food look good and taste good but watch out for their wooden skewers in some of their items, they don't taste so well."}
{"text":"I live in Henderson but when i'm in the mood for yummy deep fried goodness this is the place to go. The menu is very simple but they did a great job narrowing it down to  few delicious items. I've had the furikake bento, mochiko bento, kimchee fried rice, and I've cre"}
{"text":"Love the Bento's and very cheap for what you get.  Garlic bento with pork fried rice is my favorite.  Workers are very nice and place is very clean. Highly Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"First time I had Furikake Bento and it was great. The only thing wrong with this place is the name. Rice Trax? It might make more sense if it was near the race track."}
{"text":"The fried rice was very tasty. Beef kabobs were great as well, however the shrimp kabob was very dry and tasteless.  The owners are very friendly and place looked clean.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I miss when this place was located on Jones and the wait wasn't that long.  

One star taken off because of how ridiculously long it took for our two 3 item bento boxes to be ready.  It would have been 1 1/2 stars but I am not offered that option lol.  From ordering to finish, it was 45 minutes.  Granted, it was a busy dinner hour.  It just sucks when you are hungry and waiting.....

I always have kimChi in my fried rice, always.  At this new location, it seems like the fried rice got sweeter.  I'm not fond of too much sweet teriyaki-ish flavor, especially in my rice.  The garlic chicken is the bomb and my favorite here.

Next time, we'll just order before we get there."}
{"text":"Asian fast food and lots of it. It was intresting, just not something I want or crave. The kids love it, its fast and convenient. No frills, nothing memorable,  it is what it is."}
{"text":"I'll just add to the wave to great reviews...  This place really is awesome.  The kimchee fried rice is so good and the garlic chicken is 'broke da mout' good.  What really makes this place special is that everything is good in the bentos.  Not just the main part, but all the sides are great too.  The yakitori beef skewers are very tender, the salad dressing is tasty, the tempura is very fresh and delicious.  I really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Not impressed! I had the chicken katsu curry box, which was overflowing  with the cubed box store bought curry. I could barely see my fried rice from all the curry! The chicken was extra crispy but cut very thick which I hate. The mac salad was overdosed with pepper. There was a small portion of salad which was ok, but the dressing was too tangy for my liking. 
The restaurant was very small, maybe sits 20 people and was kinda dark inside. The menu selection was very minimal and mainly focused on there fried rice. 
Won't be back."}
{"text":"After driving past this place on my way to work everyday, I had been dying to try it. Little did I know that this great mom n' pop bento shop is chock full of hawaiian-japanese food tastiness served with quite the aloha spirit! 

Rice Trax offers up a DIY bento-box menu where you pick a meat (vegetable, chicken, beef, or shrimp), a cooking style (battered, katsu, grilled, or mixed), pick your veggies for your fried rice (or choose steamed rice if you'd like), and then your sauce for dipping (teriyaki, katsu, garlic, sweet chili, korean). OR you can just choose one of their at-the-ready bentos such as the Garlic Bento, Mochiko Bento, Fuikake Bento, or Katsu Curry Bento. 

I chose the mochiko bento, while my dining partner chose to make one himself. My bento came out with 4different kinds of meat and enough rice to be able to split with another person and still feel satisfied afterward. The cooler thing that I'm jonesing to try next time I visit? Their kimchee fried rice, which you can have instead of the regular rice options for an additional $2.25. You can also sub macaroni salad for $1.50, but I think I might just try that on the side one day since I really love my rice. 

My bento was yummy, and I love that they offer brown rice as an option. My beef teriyaki was delicious, tender, and moist, which is not something that's easy to find in places that sell teriyaki anything. My dining partner got the teriyaki dipping sauce, which tasted homemade. That alone is something I'd come back for, as I haven't been able to find a teriyaki sauce I've found tolerable since I was a little girl in Hawaii. It was awesome: not too sweet or thick, and just the right balance of salty. 

The other thing I have to try next time are yakitori sticks. They're about $1.50 each. For $8.95 for any of the at-the-ready bentos, this place is priced pretty amazingly for some damn good, down home Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Amazing local kine grinds. And super big good portions!! Love the new look. Really inviting and open and bright because of the windows. Love that you're able to make your own kine fried rice!! Get your fried rice with Kim chee...winnahs!!"}
{"text":"New to my side of town. The fried rice is cooked to order with your choice three ingredients.They have two main dishes that cover just about every meat they serve including seafood. The chicken catsu and chicken mochokino (Hawaii popcorn chicken) is what I had this time. Food was great. Service was fast. Brand new building .And I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I didn't have a personal affinity for their previous location, but my fiance did, and he really doesn't like this new location at all and thinks its lost a bit of it's charm as a mom and pop place. I, for one, love this location because 1) it allowed Tonkatsu Kiyoshi to move in to it's old spot 2) there's a lot more space and seating for when you're waiting on your order. For the first few weeks of the grand opening, I think they were still getting adjusted to the new location and orders were overwhelming them. However, I think now they have adjusted and are able to serve customers quickly again. I'm a big fan of their House Fried Rice, with added egg and corn. I usually order 3 items, which I never finish, but I figured this place is all about the reliable leftovers. For the sake of my health, I don't frequent this place too much, but it's a nice place to go to when I feel the world is just a little bit too stressful and I just want some Hawaiian comfort food. I'm not sure if they've done so already, but I think it would help if they took orders on an electronic system, versus writing every thing down by hand. I really would recommend taking a to-go menu and calling ahead if you are in a rush though, make sure to get a side of the mac salad!"}
{"text":"I was sitting at my desk and a couple coworkers came back to the office groaning and talking about this place.  I asked them where did you go?  This is how I learned about this place.  I thought to my self: \"I want to go to there!\"  So, it was a Saturday and I told the wife we are going to get fried rice at this place.  We loaded up the family and went on our mission.  

We walked in and the girl at the counter was friendly.  I didn't know what to order but I actually knew what to order.  (Does that make sense?)  I had to order the Mochiko Bento.  There are about 35 pics of this box on Yelp.  So I ordered the infamous Mochiko with kimchi fried rice.  I absolutely love KIMCHI!  I was very excited to try it.  They ask you what vegetables you want and put it on your plate.  My wife ordered the tempura plate with regular fried rice.  

After we ordered we immediately noticed that they didn't have any high chairs.  This was tough because we have a 1 year old.  We ended having her sit on our laps and we rotated so each of us could eat.  The portions were huge! especially with the Mochiko bento.  

This place was awesome.  I would of given it 5 stars if they had high chairs.  We also waited a long time for the food.  I am not against waiting if the food is going to be great, but it seemed like we waited a looong time.  So if you are in the area you HAVE to eat here!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Why you folks have to be across town?   that's okay, I\"ll drive it when I'm craving Mochiko chicken.... sadly, I always forgetting to take pictures, because I'm busting up that plate as soon as I get it."}
{"text":"Very good food!! I stumbled into this place when it was on jones and completely loved it! I waited for them to open at their new location and when they did, well it was worth the wait! Great looking place and their food is still really really good! Love the garlic chicken and the kimchi fried rice!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with my boyfriend to get some food before we headed home. We felt bad that we came right before closing, but I don't regret it just because of the fact that the food was great! 

We got the mochiko chicken plate to-go that had mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura, chicken katsu, house salad, beef skewers, and rice topped with furikake. Everything was so good and I couldn't find one wrong thing about the box of food. I'm very surprised and impressed that this restaurant uses furikake and mochiko considering the fact that most restaurants don't include those ingredients in their food. 

Overall, this place has amazing food. It would be better if their plates were a dollar cheaper but I'm fine with the prices now. The food is worth it. 

Also, we were pleased to see that the cashier noticed that we did Kung fu (she saw the shoes we were wearing)! She was friendly and interactive!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit closer to what we get back home, home being Hawaii. A big departure from the \"Hawaiian BBQ\" joints around town. Ricetrax is the type of eatery my friends and I would frequent. L&L, aloha, ohana, etc type of places I'd never set foot in when I lived in the 808, but I digress. It's pretty much all about their bentos here. Different strikes for different folks, but among my friends the mochiko chicken bento is the winner. Healthy portion of mochiko chicken, 2 skewers of chicken katsu, and 2 skewers of Teri beef. My mouth is watering thinking of this plate of food. To knock it out of the park, I sub the plain rice for Kimchi fried rice. If you can finish the entire meal in 1 sitting, you'll most likely end up skipping dinner. It's just a whole lot of food. I usually get through about half. 

This place is so good that a picky eating coworker was hesitant, nay reluctant to eat here. But I ultimately cOnvinced her to eat here. After lunch she thanked me and I asked what for. She says for making her eat there, it was now her new favorite eatery in all of las Vegas!! Most likely it won't be your new favorite, maybe it will. But I can guarantee you'll. Be satisfied with the food."}
{"text":"New location seems to be the same as the old location in terms of quality of food. Menu is a bit confusing if you're trying to make your own, but I always get the mochiko bento with kimchee fried rice so that's quite easy to order."}
{"text":"I haven't been keeping up on my yelp reviews unfortunately but I have to admit that any place I find that I frequent 5 times in under 2 weeks means it must be good!!!

I started moving on December 19th and after making on trip I pulled into a parking lot right near my new house. I wasn't quite sure what I would find but wanted to know what my choices were going to be going forward in the future..

I spotted Rice Trax at the back of the complex; it was behind a gas station as well as Outside Inn. I was a little wary so I did a quick google search and all the great Yelp reviews came up so I decided it was worth a shot.

I walked in and not sure what to order I asked the girl behind the counter for help. I really didn't want anything deep fried, so she suggested I try the fried rice.

The fried rice is build your own. You get 4 skewers of meat, chicken shrimp or beef, as well. After you have picked the meat, you choose 3 vegetables (I chose peas, green onions, and broccoli) and a sauce. She suggested the garlic sauce as their house special.

They make everything to order so I sat to wait. In under 10 minutes my food was ready to go. I took home eat as I watched a movie and was thrilled at my meal.. I have taken a bunch of people there with me since, and others have gone as a result of my tweets and pictures... 

LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"I guess I didn't realize how unhealthy Hawaiian cuisine was until I went here :)  Not that I'm complaining.  It's a limited menu but everything is delicious.  We had one of the bentos with spam, hot dogs, garlic chicken and teriyaki beef.  I wouldn't say the chicken was very garlicy, but was super crunchy and delicious.  We also built our own fried rice and had grilled chicken with sweet chile sauce.  Very good and a lot of food for your money.  We will probably be back, maybe after a night of heavy drinking.  :)"}
{"text":"Michelle and Dean are such friendly people! Not only because they're from Hawaii, just in general! My bf & I did a build your own, and Michelle was so patient with us! She explained the entire process, because our hunger was getting the best of us, and we were confused reading the signs.

So... You pick your sticks, you pick which way your sticks are prepared (grilled, katsu'd or battered), you pick the veggies for your fried rice, they have a choice of brown or white rice! Or a mixture of both... then, you pick what dipping sauces you want. I am EXTREMELY indecisive, so i requested a bit of each (teriyaki, garlic, katsu, korean, sweet chili). She was nice enough to do that for me! And THEN.. you wait, while you salivate, and listen to the music broadcasting through their laptop onto the speakers. 
 A few minutes passed... and then! Moment of truth.

At first, when i opened it, i thought it was a bit small, BUT, after i started digging in, i realized it was the perfect amount! The salad was great, the skewers were perfect, and i even had some rice left over.



I loved it so much my boyfriend and i returned later in the week and went for bentos.He got the furikake bento, and i got the mochiko. again, winners! Awesome flavors. By the way, my favorite sauces were the korean and garlic sauces. Yummmmm.

Wish it was closer to home, that's all!"}
{"text":"Soo yummy!

Rice Trax is a really unassuming-looking restaurant in a strip mall but it is super delicious and highly recommended. I had the katsu curry which was really good but a HUUUUUGE portion. My husband had another bento and i can't remember which but i THINK it was the mochiko. It had a variety of different things, all of which were very tasty and i kept stealing bites of his. The plain white rice was topped with furikake which was a nice added touch. We also tried a garlicky shrimp appetizer that was yummy, but overall we just had too much food so I would stick to the bento next time. I also want to try the fried rice. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the second time I went there with my child the line was not moving at all.  I could see it taking considerable time to get my order so I  left.  They need to figure out a way to speed things up.  There were other people with kids behind us, who were also getting ancy.  It was about 10 minutes with one person and there were 5 or  6 people in line just waiting to place the order."}
{"text":"I'm devastated after the meal! After spending half a year in this new neighborhood, how on earth would I not know there is a gem in front of my house. Fried rice is amazing and completely broke my low carb diet. Ohh can I have one more bento?"}
{"text":"We paid a visit again for lunch, and already having tied both the Mochiko and Furikake bentos, I decided to try their Garlic Bento: huge pieces of garlic chicken, hot dog, spam, teriyaki beef skewers, and okinawan sweet potato tempura...This bento was SO ONO TOO! but I think my favorite is still the Mochiko Bento which we also shared, and we added a side of furikake shrimp as well.

There is a slight possibility of perhaps another one opening up  close to Slidin' Thru NW
(The owner of the building has already proposed it to them) so I'll most definitely keep my fingers crossed and in the mean time, make the 45 minute trek to Jones and Robindale!....ALOHA!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(192/365) \" Garlic, Mochiko, or Furikake????\""}
{"text":"Let's face it, when you're Asian you eat rice and there comes a point when you begin to dread those little grains. Maybe you've even considered the Paleo Diet so you can use it as your scapegoat for ignoring grains. Wait, what do you mean no? Ah, guess it may just be me. Rice Trax is kind of an deep fried savior that came to remind me the glory of rice and its companions. 

You start off with deciding if you want a plate (for the hungry) or a bento (for the REALLY hungry, or two somewhat hungry couple that likes to split). After you get the choice of upgrading to fried rice (do it) and pick your ingredients from their \"fried rice bar\". Wait what? I didn't tell you which bento/plate to get? Get them all of course! Just kidding my favorite would have to be the Mochiko, wait no the Katsu Curry, wait actually the Garlic Bento. Hmmm! There are no wrong choices! The only problem is that unless you're a professional food eater, you won't have enough space to try everything in one go. No worries though, they have a stamp card! $5 off your next meal after 10 (?) meals.

Can't wait for them to reopen in their new location on Rainbow! When I make the switch to the Paleo Diet you better believe Rice Trax will be on my long list of \"last suppers\"."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual restaurant with outstanding fried rice, vegetable tempura, chicken and beef teriyaki sticks, you can't go wrong with \"Rice Trax\".  It's located behind the \"Outside Inn\" so it may be a little hard to find.  They also make the chicken sticks tonkatsu and batter fried style with three types of sauces to dip into.  Their \"Sin City Shrimp\" was also a winner . . . a little spicy and sitting on a bed of guacamole to cool it off.  I couldn't get over how great the tempura batter was.  The owner- chef used to work at a large Japanese restaurant so everything is of the best quality and very delicious."}
{"text":"Yep, I would like to eat here every week. I would say everyday but, that would be exaggerating it a bit. *not really*

I always find anyone/anyway possible to eat here lol
After hiking at Red Rock, the topic of lunch came up and my suggestion was this place....and despite the half hour distance, I won =)

Got the garlic chicken bento with a side of onion tempura. 
You can choose ur veggies for the tempura which got me all flustered because I wanted alllllll the veggies tempura'd.....was hoping for one of everything tempura'd but, since they were out of brocolli, I had to go with onion tempura (onion rings/not really/almost). 
Swear, I love their garlic chicken but, I shoulda went with my friends order.
He got the mochiko bento with a side of curry. And in looking at his meal, I think that's the best bet of a meal. You get the mochiko (delish!), chicken katsu (my fave katsu in Vegas), and the curry (ur own chicken katsu curry). Altho my complaint with the curry was it was sooooo little...it wasn't enough to feed the curry craving.


I have yet to try the tempura fried rice. I'll be here next week. And by next week, I mean, tomorrow!"}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Space is inefficient and somewhat poorly designed (lots of room but limited seating). Chicken katsu is on a stick. The funny & friendly manager is not behind the counter anymore.

LIKE  The mochiko chicken. The actual chicken katsu. The sin city shrimp appetizer. The furikake shrimp. The different sauces offered.

LOVE  The combo bentos/boxes. The fried rice bar. The portion sizes."}
{"text":"Rice Trax is SO ADDICTING!! And I leave with a happy food baby EVERY TIME!! xD 

This small mom and pop's take out restaurant is by far the most amazing \"Hawaiian\"/\"Japanese\" lunch place I've been to in Vegas. The food is absolutely fresh each time and sizzling hot (so if you're eager to eat, don't burn your tongue!) - the ONLY downfall is that it takes a while to get your food, BUT its well worth the wait, and if you are in a hurry, then call and order ahead of time. 

I love the Mochiko Bento with Kim Chi Fried Rice (the total meal costs about $10) and includes a scoop of crispy chicken pieces (my favorite of the bunch and goes great with the fried rice), 2 shrimp tempura, 2 HUGE chicken katsu on a stick, 2 sticks of beef teriyaki pieces, and a side scoop of salad. It also comes with 2 side dipping sauces - 1 thick sauce and 1 more liquid sauce. I'm not really a fan of the sauces, but the food stands great alone anyway."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! My roommate and I hqve eaten here for lunch and dinner for the past few days. We have tried it all. Our favorite is the Machiko Bento!!!please go everyone!! Awesome!!! And yay, I live within walking distance!!! Yay!"}
{"text":"The prices of the food here can be considered a bit pricy; however the portion size of their food is very well worth it. The food was presented in a very organized and appealing matter whether it was take out or eat in. This place has become one of my favorites for sure, especially the sauces and their house salad and maccaroni salad. Come here if your in the mood for an asian flavor somewhat similar to Hawaiian BBQ or L&L Hawaii  BBQ"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  Servings are big and staff is real friendly.  Fried rice is saweeet!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Hawaiian style teriyaki plate lunch.  This place is definitely a bit different than your standard lunch fare.

The garlic chicken plate is really good.  The mochiko plate was good too, but I thought the chicken katsu was a little dry.  Their tempura choices a varied and very good as well.  Being able to throw various fried rice onto your plate is also a very nice option.

Been there 3 times already.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Got the mochiko bento with fried rice, first thought was prices are kinda high but then you see the portion size and understand, one bento is enough to feed a small family! 

As far as the food goes it's pretty basic in flavors nothing really is going to wow you, shrimp tempura was pretty soggy and over battered, chicken was a bit dry. I wasn't expecting much out of this place just a quick place to grab something to eat. The house fried rice though... O..M...G... Disgusting, the amount of garlic and salt is way over kill that is the only flavor going on inside, I can't believe I payed extra to be tortured with this horrid rice I can't even stomach. It gets three stars because of the friendly service I got, but if I'm hungry I think I'll pass this place up."}
{"text":"Food is really good and fresh! Like the new location with lots more space. I can walk out of there without my clothes smelling like smoke. Friendly service as well!                        

Picked up many meals on my way home from work. So convenient! Sorry to see this place going out of business. Very tasty food!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what we wanted for dinner, came across this so we gave it a chance. The food was delicious, one of the best easy fast foodish teriyaki place I've had...will def come back again!"}
{"text":"I wish they weren't moving to a new location further away from me.  If you're looking for a quick great tasting meal, Rice Trax is the way to go.

1 star = for their Mochiko chicken; best I've ever tasted

2 stars = for their Fried Rice!  So onolicious!  You can tell them the ingredients to put into your fried rice to make it to your taste.  Comes out great every time!  

3 stars = for their Garlic Bento; its like Brinner! (Breakfast for Dinner)  Hot dogs and Spam?  Yum!

4 stars = for their Mochiko Bento; another one of my faves.

Lacks the 5th star because their beef skewers are really not that great.  I eat everything in the bento but the beef.  The chicken katsu can be a little dry as well.  Maybe if they weren't so thick.

But all in all, I'll be back frequently for a quick dinner. LOVE the fried rice forever!"}
{"text":"Two Words = Fried Rice.

1 star = That's right, you get to make your own and the way you like it. You get to pick what goes in, what kind of sauce to use, and it is made to order! Awesome idea, but they should put out some recipe ideas on the wall or something because it certainly slows down service as there is ALWAYS a line here. Folks can't make up their mind on what goes in their rice!  Maybe another register would work out better?

2 stars = Bento Boxes; I like that they come with so many items. It's like a mini buffet! I like their Mochicko Chicken and Furikake Shrimp sides.

3 stars = Fast food Asian food; gotta have one in the neighborhood. Great go to place for quick dinner for the family.

Lacks 4 stars because of the smell of Simple Green or whatever cleaning product they use every time I go in. Kind of ruins your appetite!

Lacks 5 stars because of the wait. Never had this problem when they were on Jones."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day.  This was our first time here.   They just opened and the lady that helped us was very helpful.   The menu seemed confusing at first but she explained it very nicely and politely, which made our experience even better.   Ordered the fried rice with chicken skewers, pork slices, beef, tempura and grilled shrimp.   Couldn't wait to get home because the food smells so good.  Got home and we were not disappointed, everything was very good.   Saw the new location they will be moving into early next year, I think it's a lot better location but same distance from our house, wish it was right next door but still not that far."}
{"text":"Was concerned about eating here since most of the food looked deep fried and I'm pretty healthy.  I got grilled chicken and grilled steak on brown stir fried rice.  Nothing short of incredible.  Great flavors all around, and a good value for the price."}
{"text":"I found out about this place because I bought a Groupon certificate $5 for $10. 

The format of the place is build your own Fried Rice. You choose your vegetables (up to 3), protein, rice and sauce. They also have robata and tempura made to order. 

1st time - ordered the Kim Chi Fried Rice, and 2 Robata sticks. I really liked the Kim Chi Fried Rice and thought the robata was ok. 

2nd time - ordered the Vege Fried Rice. It was a bit too salty for me and they didn't ask me which sauce. I think they defaulted to the teriyaki. 

Overall, I this place is ok and I would come back because of the variety of veges you can put in your order, such as edamame, green beans, broccoli, etc. You can also have the order with brown rice or a half and half mix.  FYI - they don't make it with any eggs which is not typical for fried rice. 

Tip: Don't stay in too long because ventilation is not so great and you can come out smelling like food for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!
 Rice Trax has become a favorite of ours when we want some serious grub. I love that they have a fried rice bar in which you can pick 3 indredients that your want in your own personal fried rice - you can add more for a small price. 
And, did I mention that the fried rice is so flavorful? - not bland at all - no need to add soy sauce - That's the one thing that I hate when going out and paying for food - Why should I pay you to make my food but then I still have to season it ? - Naw, I want my food ready for grubbing action immediatley!!!!

All the meat options are on shish kabob sticks except for the mochico chicken. The chicken and beef are so tender and when dipped in one of their several sauces - Ohh Baby.... THEY USE WHITE MEAT CHICKEN - more healthier and my fav!!!

The Furikake Shrimp dipped in the special sauce is so ono!!!
The salad dressing is good too - to tell you the truth I never ate anything here that I didn't like/enjoy.

Some people don't like when they are dining inside and the food is served in to-go containers but on the flip side I really like it that way, cause when it's time to go your leftovers are packed already and guess what ? No one has to wash any dishes....

Yeah - you need to go to Rice Trax and get your grub on- wish they were open on Sundays too..."}
{"text":"This little spot is hidden away on the corner of Jones & Robindale. My first time checking out the place, I walked into a small dinning area (maybe seating at most 20 or even less).  Looking at their menu, they offered different kinds of bento boxes & trax fried rice.

Breaking down trax fried rice, you basically choose 3 veggies to be mixed into your fried rice, which you can also choose white or brown rice (how awesome!). Then you get your choice of shrimp, beef, chicken, which can be prepared: grilled, battered, or katsu.
 
Oh man...the options! 

So I decided on shrimp & chicken all grilled. They serve your food in a black to-go container whether you're having it there or to go.  So, it did take a bit of time to get the food, but it was understandable since there were no empty seats in the house when I got there.  Anyhow, the food was great. The fried riced was a great portion & soo yummy. Totally hit the spot. I did like the shrimp & chicken skewer, which you get 4 of, but unfortunately it wasn't enough meat to go along with the rice. That made me kind of sad, but for the price and the left over fried rice I had, I didn't mind so much.  OH! I also forgot that they have yummy dipping sauces you can chose to dip your tasty proteins in too. I got the sweet chili & garlic sauce. Both were good."}
{"text":"I've lived literally next door to this place for years and have just recently discovered it - and I can't believe I've missed out on it for all this time! The rice is DELICIOUS! It's set up like a rice bar, and u get to choose whatever ingredients you want. On my first visit I got the Garlic Chicken with my rice, the flavor of the sauce was very good, however I was disappointed in the quality of the chicken. It had a lot fat and skin, I couldn't eat it. But the rice has kept me going back again and again! And it's a large portion, it feeds me twice. #JustDoIt"}
{"text":"Ummm... Not great, just OK... the shrimp are absolutely lousy... Chicken has a weird texture and fried rice needs more veggies... I got a hair in my food, which is never a happy event but it does happen. I've had worse meals but not recently..."}
{"text":"Bento's just like that have in Hawaii!!! But I always get a garlic chicken plate with kimchee fried rice.  The chicken is nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And the garlic sauce is money!!! The kim chee fried rice is good, I like mines a lil less spicy, but I still end up eating my whole plate.

One time I ordered take-out for lunch and they accidentally gave my order to someone else so I had to wait few minutes more which I didn't mind. For the inconvenience they gave me free tempura. 

Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Finally made it out there on our last trip to LV last week...and we weren't disappointed! So much food, we ordered the fried rice and veggie tempura with a side of shrimp tempura. Best tempura I've had in LV, cooked to perfection with a light and crunchy batter. My sister and I split the meal, they even gave us extra plates to split, not one of those \"pay extra to split\" kind of places. They're moving to a new location just a few minutes away from their first location, the new place is much easier to find. We plan on going back next time we're in LV for sure!"}
{"text":"Closed....yelp still has this location listed on s. Jones.....CLOSED. And I couldn't write review without at least 1 star.."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not as Good as when they were on Jones...their mochiko chix was cold...garlic chix was hard to bite into...their Mac salad had no taste but black pepper...BUT their customer service was Good. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"This place was another hole in the wall for me that I had to review it.  I've been on a craving for Hawaiian plate lunches, and believe me when I tell you that this place put those cravings to rest.  Although it's kind of in a hidden area, where not much things are going on, the food has really got it going on.  The decor has been the same with most fast food Hawaiian joints, like back home they stuck to keeping it plain and simple.  Hopefully the ambiance does improve but for now I'm not complaining.  With no line to my food, I order with one thing on my mind. GARLIC CHICKEN, say it with me OHHHHHH YEAH!

The Garlic Bento consisted of 2 teri beef sticks, 2 spams, 2 hot dogs, 2 garlic chicken, your choice of fried/kimchi/brown/steamed rice, salad, and tempura sweet potatoes.  I could careless about the salad and the potato, but the amazing part of this dish was the kimchi fried rice and the garlic chicken. Crispy juicy, tender, amazing....say it with me again, OHHHHH YEAHHH! Each bite was a mind blowing experience, I admit I am hooked and addicted.  The menu has more choices of bento boxes already premade and I think there's an option to make your own plate.  I also see other hawaiian delicacies apart of the menu.  

If you're eve on this side of town, give it a shot! You won't go wrong. I hope this place sticks around, because I'd be really disappointed if it didn't. The whole concept is GENIUS!"}
{"text":"Had the furikake Bento with fried rice (kimchi, pork, green onion) and a side of Mac salad. Fried rice was awesome, beef and shrimp were great, didn't get a chance to try the chicken because I was already full. The Mac salad was good not great though. They are moving though to a new location on rainbow next to dairy queen soon, but not sure when. I will most likely be a regular here. =)"}
{"text":"The Mochiko bento is yummy! It came with Mochiko chicken which is super crunchy! It also comes with beef, chicken Teriyaki,  and shrimp tempura. The portions are huge and delicious!  I would love to come back and try their fried rice. The food along with the portions are a great deal!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Freshly made the way you want it. Thank goodness I didnt have to pick through my rice for stuff i didnt like. Prices are great. For one plate we can share with 3 people. Literally could share."}
{"text":"I've been here once and really liked it! I ordered some shrimp and was pleasantly surprised at the generous portion. The white rice with the seasoning sprinkled on top has me craving to return! I like the choices of rice and veggies, a breath of fresh air from normal island style grills. My husband maintains that this is a better place for lunch than dinner, but I beg to differ!"}
{"text":"Serendipity is having an appointment at my nearby optometrist and discovering that the new Rice Trax location is open! I'm a huge fan of Rice Trax, so I couldn't pass it up.

The food is just as good as I remember. I ordered the Mochiko Bento. Obviously, it comes with Mochiko Chicken and adds two Teriyaki Beef skewers, two Chicken Katsu skewers, and a couple of Shrimp Tempura. This is all served on a bed of rice with some salad on the side. It's always too much food and I had enough willpower this time to only eat about half of the bento.

No longer tucked at the back of an obscure shopping complex, the new location is much easier to find. It's right by DQ on the southwest corner of Rainbow and Robindale. The interior is bright and welcoming. The employees are friendly.

This is all great news."}
{"text":"This place has become my new favorite little pit stop before heading home from work.  They offer custom fried rice with a vegetable bar that you can choose from to mix into your order.  

The real treasure to this place is their chicken katsu. It always comes out fresh hot and the chicken is always nice and juicy.  

I would recommend getting the \"make your own\" which includes 4 skewers of your choice. For the skewer choices...try the chicken katsu, beef teriyaki, grilled shrimp, and battered chicken.  If you like kimchi fried rice, they can make that for you as well.  

The only downfall i would say to this place is the intense oily smell if you decide to dine in.  The delicious katsu comes with a heavy price of making you smell afterward.  Therefore, get it to go!"}
{"text":"The secret to great fried rice is seasoning. The fried rice is the tastiest I've had at a restaurant. 

The beef is always tender, mochiko chicken, and shrimp tempura is a winner. Some people I have eaten with say  the breading on the garlic chicken is a little heavy, but I don't even notice because the taste is awesome! 

Not to mention great for the kids too."}
{"text":"We were the only customers this afternoon at this small, informal family-owned business.  You order at the counter and the meal is brought to the table when ready in a plastic takeout container.  We each ordered 4 sticks of yakitori chicken which comes with a small salad and white rice.  We also requested garlic sauce on the side. It was an enjoyable lunch but I would not be in a rush to return."}
{"text":"so frickin glad i found this place! it's heaven among sin city. 
WOW!!! KAPOW! This place will have you sayin stupid words like this after you've experienced their eats! 

Small joint, nothing special from the outside at all. Looks like a typical fast food type atmosphere. BUT IT ISN'T! Had to try out some Kimchee fried rice with my Mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura, beef teriyaki, and salad. Now if you've been to other Japanese/Hawaiian type restaurants, you'll know that Bentos are already  pretty big for a relatively low price. Rice trax gives you some extra flavorful fried rice (pick your own rice and 3 ingredients) and comes with all the stuff mentioned for 9.49+tax! It's a steal. I eat a lot, i finished it all, but it had me full and coma like.. I had to guess maybe 3 pounds of food. It could feed 2 small girls, or 4 children... 

seriously it is a top 5 restaurant that i've been to since moving to Vegas. i will frequent this place for a long long time. 
also check out Yayo Tacos and I Love Sushi..some places that were super good but not as exciting as Rice Trax. Why has Guy Fiery not found this place? Step ya Game up boy!!!"}
{"text":"amazing food, amazing service! 

I was a little confused about the menu at first but with some help from the awesome staff I got  a make your own plate with veggies, beef teriyaki and white rice. 

It was delicious! Not greasy, prepared fresh and a great portion size! Now, we go here at least once a week. My fiance gets the furikake bento and he loves it! 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"There was a \"word of mouth\" that this restaurant had good food. We came for dinner and I ordered the \"Make your own\" plate with brown rice (combined with corn, carrots and green unions) and grilled shrimp. I must say that it was AWESOME!!! I also tried the chicken katsu off my girlfriends plate and that was good too!!! I would recommend the grilled shrimp, battered shrimp and chicken!!!  I haven't tried the chicken katsu or the beef, so I will definitely come back again.


I really don't have any negative feedback regarding this place other than their location. It is really hard to find. 

I'm definitely recommending this to my friends!!!"}
{"text":"veryy good stuffs!!!! love it"}
{"text":"Really wanted to give this place a try because my husband wanted to go for weeks now. The food looked good, smelled good but the service was too damn slow. 

The idea of mixing and matching is really the only excuse to give this place one star(besides the fact 0 isn't an option lol)

From the time it took me to place my order and then to check on it, my lunch break was already over. And the food wasn't even ready for take out. 

Thankfully they gave me a full refund, but there's no need to take 25 minutes for one order. 

It must be good if the girl at el pollo loco told me to try it. She told me to call ahead to save myself the wait. Hopefully we can try this out again in a few months!"}
{"text":"Why did no one tell me about this place? lol
I stumbled upon the reviews while searching for a tasty place near my house and decided to give it a try. I got the mochiko bento like the tips said, and it was amazing. So much variety of meats and every one of them was oh so good~
The next day I got the furikake bento. The dipping sauce for the shrimp? mhm~ it is spicy but not too spicy to make you cry and the crunchiness of the furikake shrimp is great. Nothing is left to be thrown out except the non-edible skewers and utensils. Even now as I'm writing this review I just want to run out of my house and get some more bento. Haha."}
{"text":"Foods are so delicious!!! For dinner: kimchee fried rice and salad. For dessert: tempura ice cream (da BEST!) and can order sugar bites too, it's good!"}
{"text":"after seeing a FB friend's pictoid of her ricetrax food.. i knew i had to check this place out!

came here around 8pm for dinner to go. i absolutely agree with other reviews when they say the ventilation system needs to be replaced/upgraded. just standing there while the food was being made you could sense the smell of the food saturating your clothes. leaving the front door open could possibly help but since it was so effing cold outside that wasn't an option.

took Vince L's recommendation and got the \"make your own\" plate. tried to get the exact same plate but they were out of grilled shrimp. they had shrimp tempura as an alternative. for my veggies i got corn, peas, and green onion.

my favorite of all the skewers has to be the chicken katsu. totally fresh and crispy... the chicken was juicy inside... and it wasn't too greasy. next was the battered chicken. i liked the tempura batter they used on it. it gave it a nice texture. the shrimp and beef teryaki were last. still good.. but it didn't wow me like the chicken skewers.

the rice let me down. if it's sesame oil they use in the rice... they used too much. it made the rice a little mushy. the garlic flavor was super strong and it was just overall.. too overwhelming. the portion is huge but since the flavors were so strong it was hard to finish.

i got the sweet chili sauce which was pretty much mae ploy sauce. lol. next time i will get the garlic sauce. i highly recommend it. 

will i be back? probably. maybe i will just stick to the skewers and just plain white rice or just brown rice. 

service was super friendly and very helpful when ordering."}
{"text":"Mildly embarrassed to say that I had dreams about this place after eating there the first time.  This is definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"man, i love the food here!

my fav is the mochiko bento with substituted kimchi fried rice.  LOVE the rice.  its such a great price - i've paid much more for worse tasting food.    the bento is pretty big... it comes with 2 shrimp tempura, two chicken katsu's on a stick, 2 sticks of beef teriyaki, and some salad.  the fried food here is just so damn crispy and the teriyaki sticks are so flavorful.  it reminds me of filipino bbq sticks, just not as fatty.  it also comes with these little crispy pieces of kind of a teriyaki flavored chicken (not sure of the exact name of it).  the food doesn't get soggy at all if your doing take out.  rice trax is NOT healthy - thats why its tastes so good.

they cook your food to order i think.  thats a good thing (the food is fresh!) but also a bad thing if your in a hurry.  food does kind of take long to get, so i would recommend placing your order in advance.  place is nice and clean too.  (one thing - you leave there smelling like food for sure!).  one thing though - its kind of hard to miss so be on the look out on the corner of jones and robindale.

i really appreciate it when mom and pop places produce awesome and great tasting food.  i'll be back again and again.... i want everyone i know to taste the food here."}
{"text":"Great fried rice -brown rice! A craving of mine for this cheat day dinner of mine! Yummy!! Call ahead of time --"}
{"text":"Discovered this place through my friend's IG (thanks Mae!). This place is 4 stars just for the ease of ordering, decent variety, flavor, portion size (large- very Hawaiian) and flavor. I particularly like the Mochiko chicken. Fried rice seems to always come sautéed in some kind of soy-based sauce. Very Hawaiian in flavor and focus. Decent options in fountain drinks including 4 types of iced tea. All in all for prices hovering around $9.50-$12 it's a filling, somewhat fast option for a working lunch. I had to take off stars for 1) very limited seating, 2) no POS system (waiting in line to order is common since they WRITE DOWN all the orders!). Everything btw comes in a styrofoam takeout container- even done in orders, lol. Other than that, decent place to grab a simple filling Hawaiian plate-style lunch."}
{"text":"This place is everything I love in a restaurant, quick, cheap, and huge, I mean HUGE PORTIONS!

I walked in and looked at the menu and just stared.........I couldn't figure out what I wanted, because really, I wanted one of everything.  Unfortunately I don't have a bovine stomach, so I had to choose just one.  The Mochiko bento box!  The bento boxes come in a partitioned styrofoam box with salad on one of the small sections, sauces in covered cups in the other side, and on the big half of the box, rice seasoned with furikake topped with all the meat.  Get this.  2 skewers of Mochiko battered white meat chicken, 2 skewers of teriyaki beef, and a pile of chicken katsu.  Mochiko chicken?!?!  What are you?  Why have I never seen you before?  Chewy and crispy at the same time, you're like a culinary paradox of deliciousness!  The chicken katsu is small pieces of chicken versus individual tenders battered and fried, and it makes so much sense to do that that way, because you get more crispiness per square inch that way. The teriyaki beef was on the dry side, so not soaked in sauce, and that was a good thing.  Just slightly more well done than I usually like, otherwise still good.  Oh, I almost forgot the salad, it was iceberg covered in a ginger dressing.  I ate the whole thing of salad.  Rice with furikake?  Thumbs upskis!

I couldn't finish my food in one shot.  So I gladly took it home and had it for lunch the next day.  

So come to Rice Trax if you want to make yourself a food baby for not a lot of money!  I did, and I'm planning to come back for either the Garlic bento or the make your own fried rice. 

BTW, they have brown rice!  If you're into that sorta thing....

Go White rice!!"}
{"text":"Yummy teriyaki. If you like garlic, this is your place to try. Their shrimp tempura is tasty!"}
{"text":"i live right by this place so i eat here at least once a week for i always tend to get the furikake bento and some sweet potato tempura on the side. i love how the owners actually are the cooks. everything is portioned out so everytime you go there its always the same size. i know when you go to places like L&L or Ohana its always in consistent. now my fiance always seems to get something different for i seem to try what she gets. the fried rice is also very good! dont forget the sin city shrimp."}
{"text":"Like this place very much.  The fried rice is extremely good   I get the bento box 3.  And aways have leftovers for that midnight snack.

Very sad that they closed their doors.  The food was very good"}
{"text":"Not the healthiest food but who cares!
I've been living in the vicinity for years and finally got my butt to Rice Trax.
I was disappointed in the girl that waited on me (I think she may have been new). There was no line so I let her know it was my first time in and was a bit overwhelmed with the menu. She didn't bat an eye or offer any advice, so I chose to build my own bento with Chicken Katsu (on a stick), Shrimp Tempura, and Shrimp Furikake. I had no idea what Furikake was and I asked the girl, her response was, \"it has seasoning on it, it's good\". Not very helpful, I verified that it wasn't spicy and put in my order. I noticed after the fact they have Mac salad, so I ordered a side. I now know you can substitute it in place for their salad for an up charge. (No thanks to counter girl).  She never mentioned I could get fried rice or did I want any certain sauces. I know for next time though. 
Who I am guessing was the manager was very nice and efficient, I wish she would've waited on me! I got my food quickly. I liked all of my food. There was one sauce they gave me, I didn't care for. The portion of rice was huge!  Price is maybe a tad high but it was fresh, not greasy, and tasty. I will definitely go back, an probably soon!"}
{"text":"I had the mochiko bento lunch - DAMN tasty!  If you are in LV and want a delicious lunch for under $10 be sure to stop by!  I'm in LV all too often (not my fave place, sorry); Rice Trax just got added on to my \"eat here when you're in town\" list!  And it's just down the street from the office, too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite chicken dinners at my mother in law's when I lived in Hawaii was her mochiko chicken.  So when we came here for dinner and it was on the menu, I thought why not give it a try, after all, it had a been a while since I had had some.

I got the Mochiko Bento, with mochiko chicken, beef teriyaki, chicken katsu, shrimp tempura and mac salad.  It also came with fried rice and you got to choose the ingredients. 

Everything was very tasty and fresh.  I love that they make up the fried rice, made to order and you get to select your own.  Did it past the test, yes, it was as good as mom's!  And this place is a lot closer."}
{"text":"Wow! Thank you Rice Trax for making an awesome take out lunch plate!!  Your garlic bento is bomb! 2 steak skewers, a hot dog, 2 spam and 3 pcs garlic chicken!!! So filling...and worth it!  My only complaint is the sweet potato tempura on both our plates were so small and cold.  Other than that we will be back to try other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Wait time was ok not as bad as other reviews. We got 2 plates and waited maybe under 10 min (but no one else was in there). Cost was just under $20 for a 3 and 2 choice. Food was pretty tasty as I remember. Serving size was also pretty good! On the 3 choice my 3rd item was spam (for my son), and they gave 3 slices. There was a slight smell in the restaurant that wasn't appealing but it subsided after a few minutes and the bathroom has no soap!!! Yuck.....so that's why the reduction of 2 stars. You guys gotta keep up with at least providing soap....tsk tsk. Other than that it was good but room for improvement. I'd like to see a low carb option....like a shrimp salad or something. If you do have it, it isn't on the menu...."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that this is my FAVORITE local \"Hawaiian\" plate lunch joint that I have had in Vegas to date.  I have been here a few times and am finding myself to be somewhat addicted!

I've had the opportunity to try the garlic bento and the mochiko bento.  Both of which are fantastic.  The garlic bento comes with their GARLIC CHICKEN which is definitely the highlight of the dish.  I can't express how BOMB it is... crispy outside, soft juicy inside, and an amazing garlic glaze. The bento also comes with teriyaki beef, spam, a hot dog, and sweet potato tempura.  The mochiko bento had mochiko chicken, chicken katsu, teriyaki beef, and shrimp tempura (yes -- portions are generous so I usually will take home leftovers).

Now, the bentos normally come with white rice, however, please take advantage of the opportunity to sub one of their fried rices (which are also deeelish).  I have tried the pork fried rice and the kim chee fried rice. I loved both it just depends on my mood.

So for all you out there who appreciate a good plate lunch like I do, this place definitely beats out Aloha Kitchen, Island Flavor, etc etc.  Their selection isn't as vast, but for what they do serve, the food definitely beats out all the competition in my opinion.  I have feeling this place is gonna blow up real soon if hasn't started to already. A++++"}
{"text":"I had shunned this place previously....due to earlier reviews when they first opened, but my boyfriend ordered to go for us from here...and I am SOO WRONG! I hate admitting that....but the food here is quite tasty.  My favorite is the mochiko chicken...tender fried chicken with sweet/garlic flavor.  The furikake shrimp and grilled chicken skewers are really good as well.  The beef was okay, just a little dry and not quite as tender as I would like.  The salad was probably the most disappointing part...shredded iceberg lettuce..but the dressing was tasty.  Overall, for a fast food type joint...I'll be back for some more mochiko chicken and grilled chicken skewers!"}
{"text":"I forgot how much I liked this place. 

The garlic chicken bento is just a box of salt, nitrates, grease and deliciousness - we're talking about breaded chicken with garlic sauce, a hot dog, a slice of spam and a teriyaki beef skewer. Brown rice and a nominal portion of salad are just the recipe to give you the illusion of health as you wolf all this down.

Also of note is Rice Trax' build-your-own fried rice bar. It's a brilliant concept whose time has come. You choose your own ingredients and your rice is made to order. It's fresher and more flavorful than any fried rice I've eaten before.

Is this Hawaiian? Is it Japanese? Is it a grotesque orgy of excess and choice that is uniquely Las Vegas?

The answer is Yes. Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus, and he's fat because he knows how good the garlic chicken bento is here."}
{"text":"Delicious Hawaiian style food.  My choice is the Furikake Bento.  Try this place!  You are literally wasting your life not eating here.  Friendly staff and great food!"}
{"text":"Finally this place is open again! I missed them when their Jones location closed down.

First, I have to say, they have some of the best macaroni salad I've ever had, ever, anywhere, period. It tastes extra delicious with a dash of siriacha sauce. I could order a side and finish it all to myself. 

Their kimchi fried rice is my favorite. At their new location, they don't list all the different types of rice anymore, so if you don't see it listed, definitely ask for it anyway.

All their meats are crispy and come in large portions. Perfectly cooked, tender, and tasty. 

Overall, it's a great place to catch a quick bite that is 100% better than the average fast food. Oh, but come during a less busy hour, because food here always takes awhile to get to you."}
{"text":"This place is a quick serve Japanese restaurant and kinda Hawaiian style.  

I like this place more than 3 stars.  The service was friendly and I appreciate a place that is different.  They had some interesting menu items and I went with the grilled chicken yakitori.  

Chicken skewers on rice and a side salad.  The chicken was dry and not a lot of flavor.  I liked everything about this place except the chicken just didn't taste good.  

I would go back but it is on the other side of town.  I would like to try different menu items.  I really appreciate a family owned place like this that is a little different, but unfortunately the chicken just didn't taste very good."}
{"text":"Tasty, good prices, excellent kimchi rice.  Really enjoyed everything ordered."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with Rice Trax. We went last week after waiting for it to finally open. The fried rice was way too oily and I couldn't even eat it. My beef was very dry. The macaroni salad is very good though. We ordered the tempera and it was $150 for 3 coin size prices of carrots. It was not absolutely horrible but I wouldn't rush to go back."}
{"text":"Good food.  The chicken and beef that comes on the stick is actually very good.  It's not the cheap junk that you get at most places.  Very good texture and flavoring.

The shrimp though, not so much.  It comes heavily breaded which I am not a fan of at all - although this is well done.  I prefer more of a light batter but will just steer clear of this next time.

The fried rice is excellent but a little spendy."}
{"text":"This was one of the best restaurants I've ever been to...in any price range. The food was just fantastic. Everything. Ever since they moved to the new location I didn't go there as much. And now I no longer live in lv. Nevertheless I'm shocked it's gone. 

You don't miss your water till your well runs dry. 

The picture on here are driving me crazy. 

Please come back. We need you. I promise I will visit you more often."}
{"text":"First review.

This place is the best Hawaiian BBQ plate lunch-style restaurant in the Las Vegas Valley.  The food is spectacular and the price is jaw dropping.  I've ordered a few things off of their menu, and haven't been disappointed.  

The first time here was with my girlfriend, I ordered the Garlic Bento and she ordered the Furikake Bento.  We both went with different options on the fried rice, pork fried rice for me and Kim Chee fried rice for her.  

Both dishes came out magnificent.  Everything was hot, the garlic chicken had an excellent crisp.  The beef was tender and very flavorful.  Her shrimp was breaded to perfection, and it came with a well balanced tartar sauce which gave the dish a good contrast in tastes.  The fried rice was no where near soggy, and the spice from the Kim Chee was just right.
I've eaten Kim Chee fried rice at Korean restaurants, and those fried rices have not measured to what you can get at Rice Trax.

Try the Mochiko bento too, the Katsu is awesome and the Mochiko chicken is amazing.

Reminder: Great food takes a little while to prepare, you must allow these wonderful people the proper time frame to make your food.  Wait times on plates are 20-25 minutes, call ahead if you can't wait that long.  Believe me, the wait and the price is WELL worth the product.  You should not criticize if your order takes a while to produce, go to McDonalds if you want something in 30 seconds."}
{"text":"The mockico bento with fried rice is where it's at."}
{"text":"Shame! They closed this business and decided to text some workers they closed. And I believe some showed up to work and with was closed. Poor management and shame for local people."}
{"text":"Super bomb plates!! Get the pork fried rice with any bento and your pretty much hooked! Call ahead to avoid any waiting but trust me the food is worth any wait!"}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place another try, and it was much better the second time around!!

I ordered the Garlic Bento, which came with:

-Garlic Chicken: crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Great sauce!
-Teriyaki Beef (on skewers): same as the last time. I still think it needs more Teriyaki flavor, then it would be perfect!
-Spam: well, I am from Hawaii, so of course I love Spam!
-Hot Dog: just a regular hot dog, but a nice addition to the bento.
-Sweet Potato Tempura: I don't really like sweet potato, so I gave it to my husband. 
-House Salad: lettuce is thinly sliced and easy to eat. Good dressing!  

This place is a little far from where I live, but definitely worth the drive whenever I happen to be really hungry and in the mood for a good bento. Friendly service, clean restaurant and generous portions that will make your tummy happy! I'm glad I finally found something very good and tasty! 

Next time I will try the Katsu Curry Bento!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the rave reviews on Yelp and noting the proximity to my house, I was on a mission to try this place. We ordered a little of everything to try as much as possible. The service was friendly and I was extremely impressed the make your own fried rice option. You pick the ingredients you want, which I love, kim chee or jalapeno are a must!

My mom and fella were huge fans of the garlic chicken. It was quite tasty, but I enjoyed the katsu with curry. I can't wait to try the Mochiko chicken bento that everyone raves about. For the amount of food you get and how fresh and made to order it is, I think it's a pretty good value. My meal was enough for two meals. 

Definitely delicious, I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Food is great and price is great as well, but service is super slow.  Took almost 20 minutes to pay for a to go order. 

Staff is friendly & the place is clean. Location is really easy to find and great since I live less than a few minutes away."}
