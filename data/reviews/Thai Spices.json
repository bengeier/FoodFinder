{"text":"great food, but better service, warm, friendly fun. Genuine food and they know what I eat and drink, (love the singha) I go once a week, and would like to go more.  Nice job"}
{"text":"Amazing! I have eaten here several times and have tried much of the menu. I haven't had a bad dish yet. Everything from the Panang curry, Tom yum soup, beef salad, BBQ pork, and of course the pad Thai. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The taste is good but not the rice they use. The rice they use is kinda watery and sticky. Service is good. Ambience is clean and appealing. I ll go again for sure."}
{"text":"I was always looking at this place everytime the family wanted pho (next door). Well I finally had a chance during lunch to have one of my favorite Thai dishes Papaya Salad w/ Shrimp. It was great a dish I had ordered w/ medium spice. It was a little lite for me so I will make it hot the next time I visit. Thai Tea was nice & sweet, maybe a little too sweet but was great nonetheless. I look forward to taking my wife to get her opinion. So far so good."}
{"text":"Always great service and tasty food. Been coming here for 7 years. Staff is knowledge and good with recommendations. Food comes out fairly quickly. Never a long wait and usually we're in and out within an hour or less. The Thom Kah soup is amazing and best I've had from any Thai place. Servers are attentive. My water glass is never empty."}
{"text":"Until recently, it has proved difficult for me to write a useful review of Thai Spices. I can't seem to get enough fried rice, so almost regardless of which individual restaurant I visit (with one notable exception), that's what I typically order. And as much as I'd like to review restaurants based solely on that preference, the quality of a staple like fried rice is only really notable if it's not up to par.

That said, we were there for dinner last night and I tried some of their other dishes. We started with edamame and their crab puffs. While we normally wouldn't order appetizers, the happy hour discounts are pretty compelling. I was somewhat disappointed with the edamame, which was cold by the time it was served, but the crab puffs were absolutely phenomenal. For an entree, I had my standard fried rice (Thai Spices does this better than most) and also tried my counterpart's Pad Thai. I thought it was excellent, but having never tried Pad Thai before, I don't really have any basis for comparison.

I've been here multiple times for lunch and want to make special mention of the fact that the service for dinner is markedly better than the service for lunch, with which I had been previously disappointed. I tend to drink a large quantity of water with meals and our server was not only friendly, but prompt and efficient. I think she probably refilled my glass six times.

Thai Spices is definitely worth a visit. With a focus on improving some of the small details mentioned above (edamame quality, lunch service), it could easily be given five stars.

{"text":"Amazing Place. Excellent service. Starting with the Veggie Spring Rolls which were good, but the accompanying sauce that just gave a suggestion that it was sweet and sour pulled the whole starter to the next level. For dinner we ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and the Pineapple Rice (both medium hot which proved to be just right). The Pad Thai was authentically delicious and the Pineapple Rice unexpectedly surprised with a few big shrimps, chicken, and tofu, but nevertheless, was uniquely tasty. The Pumpkin curry on the $5 menu is a must order. We also enjoyed sticky rice with fresh ripe mango and a not too sweet milk. The whole experience was perfect. Nicely decorated modern atmosphere with an obvious Thai theme. Clean restaurant and bathroom. What more could you ask for. We will definitely be going back for more! In the buzz and influence of a belly fully satisfied with wonderful Thai food, my husband even declared Thai food as his new favorite cuisine!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! If you like spicy but not painful spicy order medium spice.  Awesome prices! The waiter will ask once if everything is ok and then leaves you alone which i like very much!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in the Valley, bar none, at very reasonable prices, and with terrific and friendly service!   I just got back from a trip to Thailand, and as great as the food was over there, I didn't find anything to compare to Thai Spices' pineapple fried rice (khao pad supparot).  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Thai restaurant we have found in town. Not only is the food delicious, authentic, and reasonably priced, but the restaurant has a clean, inviting atmosphere and the staff is always very friendly and efficient. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wow. A friend really hyped this place up before we went and it was amazing! Definitely was not disappointed. Best crab puffs I've had. Curry comes is good sized portions and is delicious. Only problem is I wished I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place by accident as I had recommended to a few friends to meet up for dinner at BoCa7. Lo and behold, BoCa7 was closed for good... :*(

But what's this? A new Thai restaurant was going to be in its place?? Sweet, we're down to try it! The doors were open for what we thought was for construction but one side of the restaurant was available for serving.

A familiar face from BoCa7 was Kang the server, which helped bring down the shock of BoCa7 being gone. We ordered Tom Yum Chicken soup and New Zealand mussels for starters...Tom Yum very flavorful and the mussels w/ broth had a nice touch of basil to it. We decided to get several dishes to sample and every one of them were great, but the 2 standouts were the Himmapan Chicken (Thai Cashew Chicken) and Talay Thai Paneng (Shrimp, Calamari, Fish and Scallops in panang sauce). I've had several variations of the Himmapan Chicken before and I really like Thai Spices' take on the dish using crispy chicken. Everyone kept digging in this plate as well as the Talay Thai Paneng, which had a nice buttery consistency to the panang sauce....so good w/ rice! 

We also ordered Tutti-Frutti-Frito Fish (crispy salmon w/ mango and apple shreds and lime vinaigrette) and Tamarind Delight Shrimp (crispy shrimp w/ veggies served w/ a subtle tamarind sauce) which were also excellent. The apple and mango shreds gave a fresh texture and taste to the salmon steak, which was a big chunk. Thai Iced Coffee was very good. The only thing we wished was that a bucket of rice was served for the whole table instead of a small tray w/ a cupful for each dish. Oh, and that we were half-expecting the Tutti-Frutti-Frito Fish to be dressed up in a Chiquita banana outfit or that it would be served with maracas and a dance...I'm sure Kang can probably be convinced to do so ;)

We all agreed that we are returning here to sample some more of the menu's fare. Right now my bulging stomach wants to veg out a bit, haha. Great stuff..."}
{"text":"Discovering Thai Spices with my family was one of the best discoveries a family could make! A delicious and authentic asian cuisine is what this restaurant has to offer. The restaurant atmosphere is very laid back and calm. It is somewhere where one wants to be and feels comfortable being there. Not only does Thai Spices offer a soothing environment but also a variety of mouth-watering menu items. 
The menu has a large range of foods to choose from, the appetizers, entrees, desserts, including the drinks are all unique. As for myself, the Thai tea was one of my favorite items to order. It is refreshing and leaves my taste buds wanting more. My other family members prefer the fried calamari appetizer which is fried to a crisp and is served with a perfect sauce to compliment the taste. 
Going to Thai Spices as a first timer will most definitely include anything but disappointment. The food is authentic and is made fresh. Thai delicacy is hard to find in Arizona with so many few Thai restaurants but Thai Spices is #1 on my list of places to go whenever me and my family are feeling hungry. The restaurant stays clean and delicious all year round, with great service as well."}
{"text":"My best Thai food I hv had till date.  Me nd my husband are very fond of Thai cuisine nd hv almost tried ever Thai restaurant in tempe and Mesa,  but food here has stopped our search for d best Thai food.  I don think i will ever go to any other place for my fav cuisine"}
{"text":"I never have a bad meal at this place. A few of my friends and I went here last night and had yet another great experience. I got the Rama's Chicken, my girlfriend got the Tom Kha Noodle Soup and my friend got the Chicken Chow fun. Thai hot is the way to go for the Rama's but tends to be way spicier in other dishes. We were all satisfied with our food and were more than excited for the leftovers. I definitely recommend this place to all lovers of great thai food."}
{"text":"Great tasting drinks. I think its one of the best places to get a milk tea. I get the taro milk tea or the Thai milk tea with boba. The pork buns were perfect. Thats all I have had here. Four stars for the drinks!"}
{"text":"surprisingly really good thai food. I often try different thai places in tempe and mesa to see which place has the best food, and i think this place is definitely top 5. I had the classic chicken pad thai (hot) no tofu and it was very good. great portions too, and very affordable. The restaurant is good looking as well, and the waiters are friendly. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Have had three excellent meals here; would rate it 5 stars, but the service is only fair.  Servers are friendly, but have made mistakes on the orders.  Atmosphere is excellent, though the music the play should be consistent with the environment; not american pop.  I would highly recommend the Mango Sticky Rice.....Superb!!"}
{"text":"Great food (authentic taste) at reasonable price, friendly staff and warm atmosphere! Should try it when you have a chance."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever met. I just told them I don't like too sweet food and whether they had some spicy dishes. They are so rude that told me everything is sweet and their faces were like telling me to go away. Very impolite and unrespectful. Will never visit it again."}
{"text":"Awesome panang curry, pumpkin tofu curry, pad see ew. Very nice staff. My favorite for Thai lunch. Clean and comfortable dining area. There is an Asian supermarket right there too so you can shop for exotic ingredients before or after your meal."}
{"text":"Amazing offering of authentic Thai dishes, great service, nice ambience.  Checkout the Crazy Crab Puffs and Spicy Catfish-Mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Best thai food we've had in the Phoenix metro area. We recently moved to mesa from Washington state where there is plenty of amazing thai, needless to say were picky. Thai spices is tasty, authentic, friendly, and reasonable. We have made it one of our staples here in the east valley. Great happy hour too!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get red beef curry and pad thai when I lived in the area.The fried calamari is delicious too! The server girls are always delightful."}
{"text":"When the food is good, it's awesome. We've been there several times over the last couple years. Maybe they go through cooks quickly? The quality, seasoning, and \"4 stars\" spicy preference is inconsistent from time to time. If they weren't right up the street from where we live, we probably wouldn't go very often."}
{"text":"Food was okay... sauces were awesome!  You have to try the sweet chili sauce, I put it on everything.  My two main critiques; one, the water is awful... it tastes like soda water without carbonation and full of chemicals it actually burned a little, and two the pineapple fried rice was over cooked (over cooked eggs to the point they were burnt... yuck.  We also had chicken satay... decent."}
{"text":"This place is discrimination about Asian honestly. My bf & I were here for lunch and we were the only Asians at this time. There are 6 tables of American guests. The place wasn't busy at all. There are two waitresses. The waitress offered EVERY tables a soup to start off right when they sat down but not for me and my bf. I mean ALL THE TABLES just not mine. I didn't even bother to ask for it because I don't think that is necessary. Ok next, so the waitress went straight to tell us to order the food. So we did. We ordered 4 dishes for two of us. There was no bowls or plates for us even when the foods come out. We had to ask for it. They don't even bother to fill my bf and my water when it visible empty. I had to sat there to wait for them and ask for a to go box. And they don't even bother to come and ask if i need anything. BUT they waitress did asked the table next to mine and offered them services. I don't normally write review even if the place is very good or very bad. I only do verbal referral to ppl and friends to the places i like and I don't like. But at this place i felt VERY not welcome. They serve others better than their own race. I won't be back again. This is my first time and also my last time for this place. I don't mind if the foods are good or bad but reputation is important to me. Thanks to any viewers that read my post."}
{"text":"Noodle dishes are great. Pad kee mao, pad woon sen, pad Thai...  also, basil chicken, and Thom Ka Gai, all good.  BBQ pork is amazing! 

So many good things to say about them, wish I could give five stars, but unfortunately, their curries are severely lacking. Panang was lacking in flavor and very disappointing.  

Thom ka Gai is good. But could even be better if they added lemon grass and galangal."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time, it's so good! I can't get over the Pad Kee Mao, the staff joke that I have to try other dishes and I have, but I crave them so bad, lol. I love that the cooks always over-do the chili heat, if I feel under the weather, it's a quick fix ;-) The staff are really friendly, the restaurant is comfortable and I'll be going here for years!"}
{"text":"Food was well prepared and tasty. The service was quick and attentive. They serve generous portions and the three of us left satisfied."}
{"text":"This place ruled. I enjoyed some of the veggie spring rolls to start. They were not too hot, not too cold... just right. After that it was the thai fried rice with tofu. It was nice and spicy and I added a bit of the chili sauce to give it some more zest. For dessert, I had the mango with sticky rice, which was fantastic. It was a large size portion and it was fresh and tasty. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat at Thai Spices.  Good drinks, great food, and excellent service. Five stars."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite Thai restaurant. 
I came across Thai Spices when I was at Mekong Plaza trying Wholly Grill. The lunch special at Thai Spices seemed like a good deal, and I'm always up for trying new thai places - especially when they're within 1-hour-lunch-distance from my work - so i put it on my list to check out.
Since then, I've been three times for lunch and once for dinner. Every time has been consistently amazing!
With lunch you get a cup of Tom Yum Chicken, choice of egg/spring roll or crab puffs, and choice of entree (huge portion, not some scaled down lunch size sample portion!). I've had paneng chicken and pad kee mow - both are brilliant, but the paneng is out of this world. Seriously....I didn't think anyone would ever top my favorite paneng at Thai Orchid Garden in Goodyear, but Thai Spices does just that...it is ridiculously good.
The Tom Yum looks like your standard lunch soup - clear broth, chunk or two of chicken, scallions, etc...I expected the typical pepper-broth flavor. No way, not here...this is full on Tom Yummy! So much flavor in that clear broth!!! 
For my dinner visit, I had the Tom Kha Kai, Papaya Salad and Chu Chee Tempura (Shrimp)...ok, if the Tom Yum is Tom yummy, the Tom Kha is \"sweet-jesus-how-is-this-so-good\" good...my comment to my dinner mates was that it was so rich and creamy and sweet and delicious, it should be a dessert.
The Chu Chee Shrimp (shrimp tempura with paneng sauce spooned over the top) was done just right - light batter, fried perfectly...it would have been great on its own. Adding paneng was just icing on the cake. (again with the dessert comparisons - i'm guessing they use a LOT of palm sugar in their recipes).
Papaya salad was good - but to me Papaya salad is either good or terrible. It either is what it's supposed to be, or they somehow ruin it...it's never \"knock-me-over\" like a good paneng or tom kha is!
Service was attentive without being clingy. In other words, perfect. Our server was pleasant, attentive, serious, casual, comfortable, social, and respectful - she juggled all of those traits as perfectly as she did our dinner plates. There when you needed her, not there when you didn't. Drinks were refilled at the perfect time, plates were cleared, questions answered...perfect!
I'm already planning what I'm going to get this week when i go back for lunch. That's my definition of 5-star!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that this thai restaurant was definitely something that came as a surprise. As I was looking for a fulfilling meal on a friday night after work this definitely did the trick. The two ladies that work the front of the restaurant are super nice and helpful. I had the red curry with tofu and returned 2 days later for more, so yes it was just that good. I got the mild flavor which had a bite but the medium would also be a choice. I love how they make the curry overall it seems like it takes much preparation and doesn't consist just of a powdered curry. Overall, very clean doesn't smell like those weird restaurants that you aren't sure what comes out of the back and definitely reminds me of back home in Los Angeles. If you have time you should definitely check on the marketplace next door, it is quite the cultural experience with some exciting treats. I will definitely be back and will be trying their pad thai."}
{"text":"I love this place. Nick name for this place for me and my g/f is, \"our spot\".

The food is amazing. Reminds me of being back in San Fran. Definitely a great Thai restaurant in the Valley. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very chill.

For me and my g/f, definitely our #1 place for Thai."}
{"text":"If you love thai food (especially curry and pad thai), I highly suggest you try Thai Spices.

I'm new to the Mesa/Tempe area, and have been relying on Yelp to find places to try. I wouldn't normally bother reviewing a place with already decent ratings, but It was too good to not say good things.
My boyfriend and I shared the crab puffs, shrimp and crab pad thai, and shrimp yellow curry. Medium was the perfect level of spiciness for both of us. 

The yellow curry is thick, with a lot of vegetables, as opposed to many places that have watery curry with just a couple of veggies. It has a ton of flavor, but was not overwhelming.

The pad thai is some of the best I've had, beaten only by a place too expensive to be worth it. Even though I ordered the shrimp and crab, they included some tofu in it, which I thought was great. For those of you who don't like bean sprouts, they come on the side. The sauce they cook the pad thai in is delicious. At first I was hesitant to not order a side of peanut sauce (I love a lot of peanut sauce on pad thai), I'm glad I didn't...it would have been completely unnecessary.
They were very friendly when I went in, and knew that I hadn't been there before. We ordered take-out, so I'm not sure what the service is like if you sit down to eat.

They have a stamp card where, after 9 stamps, you get a free lunch special. You get a stamp very every lunch special you order, or every $10 you spend on dinner.

I thought the prices sounded great before getting the food, but thought they were even better once I saw how much food you get. I still have enough pad thai to feed me for at least 2 more large meals, and my boyfriend has at least enough curry and rice for one more good-sized meal. And for $5.95, you get 6 good sized and delicious crab puffs.

I will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Decent. Not the best. Kind of pricey. Crab fried rice was really salty."}
{"text":"Order the BBQ Pork, and as soon as I checked in at the location I got a free glass of champagne....allready off to good start"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but the food and ambiance was outstanding!  Food was clean and very flavorful!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a year now and love it! Food is great! Great music and service! You feel like your part of the family. Mom and pop feel."}
{"text":"One word to describe Thai Spices: Yowzaa!

Fab BBQ, we are definitely going back to try out more dishes.  Lunch is on great offer.  And at reasonable price, generous portions, \"What a treat!\"

Next time will stay for Happy Hours, cheap beers and cocktails too.  :-)"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Things I have never liked are delicious here. A good example is Chow mein. I generally hate it, except here. Also, my wife hates mushrooms, but loves the Basil Shitake Mushroom. Plus, their lunch menu is extensive, and everything is delicious at a very low price."}
{"text":"Split  a couple of dishes and dessert with my friend. First and foremost my favorite item was the pineapple fried rice (came with Chicken, Raisins, Nuts, Pineapple) which was made spicy, the combination of the spices and the pineapple makes me want to come here again. Also got a noodle dish called the pad key mew w/ tofu that was pretty good and spicy enough for my tasting, but my friend recommended to get it Thai Spicy if your into that. Finished up with sticky rice w/ mango and a Thai Iced Tea... Get there while you can.  Oh yeah and their music was killing it, Tracy Chapman, Shawn Colvin, Men at Work, some 90's shit."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I travel frequently for my employer and enjoy meeting people in different cultures and experiencing their food. I absolutely love Thai food, but unfortunately have only found a couple Thai restaurants out of MANY here in the valley I would consider authentic and really good! I was pleasantly surprised to stumble on Thai Spices! The warm atmosphere is inviting for lunch or dinner, perfect for just walking in or for a planned date. I can't say enough about Anna and Loc as they are always friendly, attentive, and amazing! They make you feel as if you're a guest eating a meal at their home. It's a rare thing these days, and they never fail to put a smile on my face. The food is exceptional, from traditional dishes to more mainstream, you will be extremely impressed with the quality of any dish you choose. It's difficult to make a specific recommendation because EVERYTHING is wonderful! If you really want great value and fantastic Thai cuisine, I highly recommend Thai Spices!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, $7.50 for lunch Chicken Curry Masaman which includes soup and spring roll."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful but I usually order to go because the service is inconsistent. Sometimes we get great service, sometimes it's absolutely horrible. When I first began going there the food was great and consistent. But recently the food would sometimes come out noticeably spicier than before. But overall I would order to go only if I am craving Thai food."}
{"text":"First time here. After reading the reviews I was stoked to try the  Pumpkin Tofu Curry and I glad I did. It was fabulous!  His land had the yellow curry and he said it was a 10. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I needed Thai food close to the movie theater, so we found Thai Spices. We didn't really have any expectations, but were so satisfied afterward. Happy hour appetizers are great. We only tried the spring rolls and crab puffs but after a few bites, we immediately ordered another order of each. The crab puffs have ACTUAL FLAVOR rather than just cream cheese! I'd become so accustomed to cream cheese puffs that when they actually tasted a little bit spicy, I didn't know what to think! And an order (of each) was only $1.50 for two! [happiness]

I was in the mood for curry, so the waitress recommended the green curry with tofu and vegetables. I ordered it medium spicy, and it might have been a touch too spicy for me. I'll order mild next time, but I might have been feeling wimpy tonight. My friend ordered the pad thai and commented about how it was sweeter than other Thai places (and he liked it that way). He's a southern gentleman, so he enjoys his food a little sweet.

The waitress was so cute and friendly. She was surprised when we ordered the second round of appetizers but obliged us anyway. (When two hungry 'rotund' people want more appetizers, you bring it to them!) Our glasses of iced green tea were always kept full, and the food was out quickly. I'd strongly recommend Thai Spices to anyone looking for good Thai food in Mesa."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! The best Thai Iced Tea and Tom Kha soup EVER.  So good and really not that pricey either.  We got the appetizer sampler, Pad See Ew, Tom Kha soup and some egg fried rice.  So yummy!! It was cooked to perfection and in great Buddha energy.  Absolutely wonderful!!"}
{"text":"This place was really good and I was shock by how good the food was. We order a bunch of stuff and everything came out good. Service was great, decent portion, great atmosphere and clean. I'm very picky when it comes to Thai food because I had bad experience before."}
{"text":"To start, service was a little slow to take my order. There were only two servers so I'm assuming it was because they were short staffed. After I ordered, the service was better though. 

I ordered the pad kee mao and it was pretty good I have to say. I love this dish because it has a little bit of sweetness to go with the spiciness. It wasn't as good as I am use to from my Thai restaurants in Chicago, but good for here. For a lunch portion, the size was good at a reasonable price. 

I will return here to get dinner for sure so I can have a more substantial write-up."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as always and fantastic service from Anna my server. I have eatin here many times and have never had a bad experience. It is always relaxed and I feel very welcome"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food places in AZ. Good curry (my favorite is the green curry) and good pad thai. I find so many places in AZ have bland thai food, but this place does a great job! Bonus for nice staff and easy parking :)"}
{"text":"The food is great.  The yellow curry and the pad Thai with shrimp and crab are my favorite.  Their pad Thai is a little sour, a little sweet, and spicy at the same time which is why I love it. Other pad Thai that I had didn't taste sour at all. Their services are also good.  The place is nice and clean, great atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"When we were still living in Gilbert AZ me and husband went this place countless times. Whatever we tried did not disappoint us. Their Lad Na is so good. Our all the time favorite is grilled salmon with mango salad. Cooked to perfection.  
Ladies are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"What can I say? This restaurant does serve delicious and authentic Thai food. I grew up and lived in Thailand and once I tasted the food that I ordered here, I knew that it was made by skilled cook with plenty of experience in Thai culinary. Would totally recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Thai food. The price is reasonable and the ambiance is rather relaxing."}
{"text":"Tonight's visit very disappointing. Grilled seafood platter combo way over cooked, tough shrimp, rubbery calamari, mushy fish and a red mussel ?? We drive 20 miles to eat here and to be honest I don't think I will make the drive again. Truly sad"}
{"text":"Hey Yall... All I have to say is that this place is pathetically delicious I'm a let the pictures speak for them"}
{"text":"Worst Thai food  ever eaten in Arizona. The food were so sweet taste like dessert. Perhap the chef should eaten at a real Thai restaurant to know how real Thai food should taste like. We order the lunch special my $6.95 and my partner $10.75 because his came with soft drink. Ingredient were missing but wait staff failed to mentioned. When I told the waitress the ingredients on my plate are not what was describe on the menu. She just say oh sorry.

Would never recommend this place to anyone. Wish I could give them zero star."}
{"text":"The green curry eggplant and Basil is awesome."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We used to live right around the corner and it was our go to place when we didn't want to cook. Now it is a bit farther so we go less often but its diffidently worth the drive when we are craving it. I have brought friends as well and they love it. Have not had anything I didn't like. Thai Veggie Rolls, Pad See Ew and Pad Kee Mow are some of our very favorites."}
{"text":"We dined here again and found the restaurant to be fabulous. I had the cashew nut chicken and my wife had the Thai boat beef noodle soup. We have found this to be the best Thai food in the valley. We have been to Thailand multiple times and know our Thai food. They use the right ingredients and make the chili from scratch. For example, they use the traditional Thai broccoli, where most other restaurants would use local broccoli heads. The traditional Thai food is just as you would find it in Thailand. Once again we found the restaurant to be clean and peaceful. The ambiance is serene and the service is great."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona to visit a friend, and she brought me to this place. I was very impress with the customer service. They're all friendly and even recommended places to visit. (Shout out to Ana btw!) the food is great too! How could I forget the ambiance of this restaurant. It's nice, welcoming and definitely will recommend it !"}
{"text":"I was visiting with my wife----we are here from California-----and I just want to ask the management:  WHY AM I SUBJECTED TO RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS THROUGHOUT MY DINNER?  My wife and I were looking for some good Thai food, and we liked the flavors on our plates, and just wanted to talk.  SO WHY IS THIS RESTAURANT PLAYING POP RADIO WITH ADVERTISEMENTS EVERY 15 MINUTES?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  Like I said, the food was good, and the servoce was fine, so why did they have to go ruin everything with radio voices trying to sell me insurance or furniture while I'm having a night out with my wife?  Management:  GET SOME COMMON SENSE!!!!!"}
{"text":"I believe this place was fairly new.  I had the Yum Tom, Pad Thai Shrimp and an ice coffee.  

The food was good and the service was fine.  The place was completely empty at 6 however this may be due to the liquor license pending at that time."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best Thai restaurants i have been to! Each dish i have tried is very authentic"}
{"text":"Amazing. Period. I had the Thai Basil with ground chicken. Girlfriend had the green curry with chicken. Both were outstanding. Service was perfect didn't wait long for our food. Just a great experience. We will be back as we FINALLY fond real Thai!"}
{"text":"Great everything!  Attentive wait staff and fantastic food!  I have been to Thailand and this place is just like being there!  Can I give them another star??"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  I have eaten authentic thai food all over the world, and this is some of the best I have had.  The Thom Ka soup is amazing.  The staff are also very nice and always make me feel welcome."}
{"text":"Wow. Thank goodness. After a few very disappointing tries, we finally found our Thai place in Phoenix. Everything about our experience here deserved five stars.

Beautiful restaurant - classy decor with dark wood and red glass tile all around the bar area. Certainly not what we expected when headed to a strip mall. Incredibly friendly service throughout the meal between the bartender and server. Nice bathrooms, ample parking, full bar, and TV's at the bar if you want that sort of thing.

Based on Yelp reviews we started with the crab puffs. They are on the happy hour menu - $2 off the order for a total of $4 for six crab puffs. The best we've ever had! SO much delicious filling, and the sauce was great as well. Perfectly fried. Beautiful presentation as well.

For dinner we ordered a small order of Tom Ka soup mild with tofu, and Pad Se-eew medium with fried tofu. These are our two Thai food staples, and we REALLY wanted to like them here.  Whew!! Not only were they good, we agreed that they were among the best we've ever had. The soup seemed very authentic with fantastic flavor and tons of veggies. Exactly what I want every bowl of Tom Ka to be. The Pad Se-eew was drool worthy. PERFECT amount of gravy, incredibly savory, tofu was very tender and not over-fried. The menu said it would include chinese broccoli, and we thought about asking for only regular broccoli since we tend to prefer that, but decided to wait and see how it would turn out. It actually came with a combination of broccoli and chinese broccoli, and both were delicious! 

Small criticism that is completely overshadowed by our wonderful dining experience: the only thing that needs to change is their website. The happy hour specials are outdated and according to a sign at the restaurant the hours are about to change as well. Beyond that, we couldn't have been happier with our experience. We were smiling the whole way home! Can't wait to return. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"You think you can handle heat? This is the place for you! Came in on a weekday, and had 2 lunch specials.  thanks to yelp, we also had a free thai iced tea (yum yum).

lunch special: pad thai + green curry chicken. both came with a light, lemongrass flavored soup with straw mushrooms and chicken. a nice way to begin. both meals also came with eggrolls, which were nicely fried. 

pad thai and curry were both ordered medium hot, which is about as hot as we can handle it. I don't think they joke around too much with the heat here, because we were sinus-running-nose-blowing fools after a couple of minutes. the food was quite tasty, and a generous portion for lunch + price.

it was quiet when we went, and I couldn't help overhearing the table next to us. they thought the food was too spicy, and the server was very pleasant and remade the food with no spice at all. I love that the restaurant did that without complaint. please people, if you can't handle spice, just get stuff plain and add it yourself! this place isn't some massive chain -- it affects the bottom line of real people!

good food, good people, good service, good place. watch the heat!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and each time it it's the best Thai food I have had in Az. Service has been consistently great. Has a full bar with some good specialty drinks that sometimes take some time to make but are worth the wait. Lots of mid day food and drink specials. I've tried six dishes here every one has been excellent. Portion sizes are about on par with the average of the many Thai restaurants I've tried in the east valley, while menu prices are below the average. I think Thai Spices offers a good value for some great food and drink and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Thai Spices. This place is truly a gem, and has become a special place for my boyfriend and I. He took me here for a first date, and we will continue to return. 

The decor is really cool- a fusion of traditional and contemporary. The atmosphere is calm, but friendly and inviting. Service is always prompt, and the staff is eager to assist.

The food is phenomenal. This is one of those places that makes me excited to try everything on the menu, instead of sticking to one or two things. Try the appetizer sampler- you won't be disappointed! The Pineapple Fried Rice is delicious, as is the Pad Thai.

However, if you try nothing else, get the Thai Iced Tea. You'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Had the Tom Kha Kai and the Pad See Ew. The Tom Kha Kai was in far too sweet and my friends say they are feeling sick after we had it, but the Pad See Ew was alright. Clearly very americanized, don't look for authentic Thai food here.

Also I handed them a $20 for my bill and they said I gave them $15, so I guess watch out when you pay with cash."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place. I have tried a number of dishes and all are delicious. The pumpkin tofu curry is only great and I have recommended this dish and this place tomany people. I was disappointed at the amount I was served at dinner time. I may just stick to take out and lunch. Fabulous."}
{"text":"Grabbed Pad Thai to go on a Saturday afternoon. It was not good. Very plain rice noodle and sprouts concoction with no flavor. This restaurant seemed like a great choice. The interior was nice. 4 stars on yelp? I tried it. I didn't like it. I won't be back.  I normally don't review off a first experience but if a Thai restaurant cannot make Pad Thai, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service!!! We order a tom yum soup, pineapple rice and fried tofu and it took over 40mins to arrive at non peak hour (9pm)! We saw the other table being served even thou they come in later. We asked the server and he brush us off by saying it's coming soon. My kids was starving! They even missed our fried tofu order when there is only 3 item in our order. Never ever be going back."}
{"text":"We had the green curry with shrimp and the pad Thai both great flavors and perfect spice. Great service very helpful for one of our members who is glutton free. Good atmosphere as well. If you like Thai food this the place for you."}
{"text":"This is another of those places where while the building doest stand out (because its an end cap of an asian market) the food really does. This is a goto for thai food for me cause the yellow curry is top of the line, and the crab puffs get me drooling. 

To quote ferris, if you have the means (and you do) i highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars, I totally would! This is THE BEST thai I've ever had! Quick, efficient service, in a cozy, dimly lit nook environment. This place is a thai treasure! Complex, traditional thai flavors that don't disappoint! The thai spicy is actually spicy, which is a rarity! I couldn't stop vocalizing the \"yum\" as I ate my thai basil fried rice. To top it all off, their happy hour prices are a killer deal! I can't believe all the delicious food I got for such an amazing price! Go here to deeply satisfy your taste for thai!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour every day! 
I stopped in before going shopping in the market. It's never a good idea to go grocery shopping or sober for that matter... 
Tip - DO NOT order the Mojito. It's awful. Sick to the beer and wine. 
I ordered the chicken satay, expecting some mediocre semi-dry chicken. Boy was I wrong. This is THE BEST chicken satay I've ever had. It was juicy and obviously marinated in a curry and served with a cucumber salad and a peanut sauce. You get 4 big skewers for $5. We actually ended up getting another order. 
I have not had a full meal here, but the satay will bring me back!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place! I really, really do. Let me say this first: I have been here enough times I can count it on both hands. I have given them more than one second chance to redeem themselves.

The meat is SO hit or miss. It's either incredibly cooked, or flat out tastes like leather and is inedible. It's gotta be a cook! When I get it during lunch time, it tastes like crap. Dinner time, generally, it tastes great! I usually get beef pad thai. I don't give them any specific directions to be \"well done\" or anything. 

Sigh. I probably will go back, but only because my husband has had more good meals than bad. I will probably just get noodles and stay far away from the meat entrees."}
{"text":"I go here once or twice per week for lunch.  Having been to Thailand it can be hard to find good Thai food. I think Thai Spices does an excellent job for authentic Thai food. The staff is very helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"By golly, I've found it!  After going to 4 Thai restaurants since I've moved to the Phoenix area (only 3 months ago), I've finally found my go-to spot!!! This place is close to school, clean, great food, great service and a great lunch special.  Also I'm a sucker for presentation and they go all out!  I had a great experience and they got me in and out on my short lunch break! YES!! :D"}
{"text":"Finally a Thai place in Phoenix area that actually has flavor!  This must be my third or forth Thai place I've tried, but finally.  The Tom Kha soup was delicious, full of flavor.  Pad se eh, was deliciously, lots of sauce that was very flavorful, not just spicy.  Also tried  their stir fried rice which was really good, a tad bit too much oil, but I'd rather have a little more than a little less.

Another bonus about this place is it's actually open past 9 PM, which seems like a rarity.  Restaurant also has a full bar.  I would recommend getting a seat in the front of the restaurant, rear has entrance to Mall/Grocery area which can be a little distracting while your eating."}
{"text":"This was my second Thai resturaunt in as many days.  I went with a friend who has eaten at several Thai places so I am basing a lot of this review off of his comments.  Personannly I thought the food was very good.  It had a rich,deep flavor that was very pleasing.  One thing that I have noticed is that the food is not as hot as I expected.  We ordered the Tom Ka soup with chicken.  Overall it was very good.  It comes in this neat serving vessel that has flames shooting out of the center of it.  Two things that were disappointing about this soup:  1)  I know that the soup is flavored with lemon grass, however most people will filter out the lemon grass because it is completely inedible.  There were several pieces all thoughout the soup and I was constantly picking them off of my tongue and out of the bowl.  2)  We ordered the soup Double Thai Hot.  Now, when I hear the words \"Double\" and \"Hot\" in the same sentence and they are descirbing a food I tend to get excited.  I must also admit that my tolerance to hot food is somewhat above the Bell Curve, but this produced very little heat.   For entrees my friend ordered the Yellow Curry and the Pad Thai (yes he ordered two entrees so he could take some home).  Both were very good and had a deep rich color and flavor.  I had the Pad Kee Mow with beef.  I will admit that the beef was a little tough and rubbery, but over all the dishes were good.  As I stated before, the food was not as hot as I thought and the wait staff talked me down a few notches on the heat scale.  Next time I will stick to my guns and get it HOT!  My friend gave the soup a 10 out of 10 and the entrees an 8 out of ten."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time for dinner with my boyfriend and we loved the food; the service not so much. 

We ordered 3 entrees for the two of us and got green curry -our favorite, pad Thai - smelled funky to me so I did not enjoy it as much as the first time I had it, and a Thai special fried rice - it taste like my dad's friend rice so I like it but nothing special for it to be so expensive. 

The service wasn't amazing. The servers were constantly on their phones which was off putting cause my boyfriend had a question about something and as he was asking, she just walked away and went back to her phone. 

Next time I'll just order to go."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in a strip mall!  I am so happy that my friend took me here for lunch.  The interior has the Asian theme going on and is clean and inviting.  It's not a very big place, yet it seems spacious if that makes any sense.  We were warmly greeted when we walked in and were promptly seated by the girl who was our server as well.  She was super friendly and attentive.

The menu is big and offered great lunch specials.  I went with the Spicy Beef Salad and loved that I could choose my level of spiciness.  I went with medium heat and it was perfect!  Just enough spice to give the beef good flavor.  The beef was mixed with diced cucumbers, tomatoes, shredded carrots, and red onion and it was all on a giant piece of romaine lettuce.  The portion size was just enough.  My dining partner went with one of the curries.  It smelled yummy and I got a taste of the sauce.  Very rich and creamy.  The lunch specials come with miso soup, rice, and an egg roll and they are only seven bucks!  

This was definitely one of the best Thai restaurants that I've been to.  I wish there was a Thai Spices where I live!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite restaurants, definite proof that value doesn't have to mean compromise. 

Perfect for lunch, dinner, to-go, catering, I've done it all here. 

I have pretty Americanized taste buds, but still I spring for the traditional menu often, it's adventurous without being intimidating, and it's less than seven bucks after tax for a properly filling meal. The soups in particular just warm you up inside. 

Pad thai here is also exceptional and come with plenty of meat.

I ordered catering here for a large party and it was incredibly competitive pricing plus they delivered the order such a convenience.

Great place to bring people great date place too the decor is very nice and there is a great drink/happy hour menu. While not alcoholic, I do recommend their thai ice tea if you like sweeter beverages. 

Really cannot speak more highly about this place, but there is a small warning if you are not a fan of spicy foods make sure you order yours MILD. Even some dishes when ordered mild will have a kick and medium to hot dishes can have quite the lingering burn, but I could just be a wuss. Order the sweet ice tea in case and the spice won't be a problem you can't handle."}
{"text":"Originally came here with friends and remember how good it was so came back for a date night. We were seated right away on a Friday night, no wait. The space is kind of dimly lit and has seating in nooks and corners, not a super open space. We ordered the pumpkin curry and ginger binger dishes. The pumpkin curry was excellent, creamy and so yummy. I've never had a Thai pumpkin dish, it was really unique. It tasted like a fusion dish of Thai food and Thanksgiving. I believe this might have been a season dish, not sure. The ginger binger was fresh and had lots of veggies. This tasted more like a typical Thai dish. The only thing that I didn't like was that neither of us were full at the end of the meal which is unusual for Thai food. Usually you get such a huge portion you have enough for leftovers but we both cleaned our plates and were still hungry. Still, the food was really good and the service was great. Just wish it was a little more filling."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service was amazing. It had a cute \"small restaurant\" atmosphere. We got tofu pad Thai, fried calamari, and shrimp and crab fried rice, which were all delicious."}
{"text":"Went here with my coworker for lunch. Pretty okay service and the food was good . I had their pad Thai before and it was yummy ! 

Came back and my friend had the grilled seafood combo.. For me it was a bit too sour for my liking . The calamari salad is yummy for starters and the Tom yum kha soup is good with rice :) nice and creamy taste !"}
{"text":"We went to Thai Spices tonight looking for a new Thai restaurant as our go to Thai Basil in Mesa is closed for good. 

Thai Spices completely won us over with their delicious and fresh food and incredible service. Anna was our server and was helpful and friendly. 

My only complaint is that they don't have Pad Prik King on the menu which is my favorite Thai dish. 

We had the chicken satay appetizer, Pad See Ew and BBQ pork all of which were served with huge portions and were really good! We had enough leftovers between us for another full meal. 

Glad to have found our new Thai place!"}
{"text":"I shoulda known when we walked into the place and there really weren't any Asians dining in the place... lol

Came in this place wanting to get a bite with my gal and my 3 year old... we'd wanted Pho but we decided to try a new place.

Food - Ordered Tom Kha, Pad Thai, and Yellow Curry... was ok but very \"Americanized\"... asked for medium spice and for my palete, it wasn't spicy at all. In fact, I need to ask for heat condiments to bump things up.

Service - Very attentive and personable...

Ambiance - Typical a thai place... in no way was anything unexpected or out of the ordinary.

The reason for the two stars is that, while we ended up taking much of it home and eating it later... the value was a bit low for what we paid... and, indeed, there are better places to go for Thai food. We're still exploring given that we are new to the area... but in comparison to what we were used to in Chandler, Az... we'll keep looking for our next \"go-to\" Thai place."}
{"text":"Our favorite casual Thai place. Pad See Ew and Thai Veggie Rolls are fantastic!

Service is always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Thai food.  Nothing fancy about the place.  In fact, it's kind of simple, small and minimalist but the food was bomb and cheap. Go there.  I will again for sure."}
{"text":"I got my free Thai Iced Tea by checking in ~  It was delicious!  I had the lunch red curry and it was also very good.  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  It is my favorite Thai place I have ever eaten.  I love the food and go often."}
{"text":"This is one of the amazing Thai restaurant. I am a vegetarian and there are lot of vegetarian option available. I ordered Veggie Delight and a pumpkin dish, I really hate pumpkin but still because of one of the review at Yelp I thought of giving it a try. I really loved the dish, it was amazing, I never could have thought something amazing could be made out of pumpkin. More likable about this place is great service and the way food is presented. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times now on our weekend shopping trips to the Mekong Plaza market. The food is good and the service OK, too. The inside is quite aesthetic for a strip mall location - some very nice statues and real dark wood table & chairs give the place a nice feel. 

TIPS: Order water when you are seated, otherwise they might not bring it to you. Their \"medium\" spicy is pretty hot, so if you are sensitive to Thai spices, you might want to go with \"mild.\"  Try the ginger beef, very tasty!"}
{"text":"Best Thai So Far That I Have Found!  Has the spice that I have missed from a place I used to go back in NM."}
{"text":"It sucks to say that I'm happy to give a business a 1 star review, but I am happy to give the 1 star review in hopes that the manager or owner would do something about it.

We've been to this restaurant twice. First experience was good. The lady who served us was really nice. Their soup was really good. I think it was their tom yum soup or something very similar. 

My second and last visit there was a few months ago. My husband and I took our friends from out of town to Thai spices and it was a horrible experience. We went there for lunch on a weekday. Pls keep that in mind. A weekday, not a weekend. So, it shouldn't be chaotic, but it was. There were only a few people sitting at the tables. We were a party of 5. We ordered our food which took more than 40 min. Our server was very apologetic and kept on saying the food was coming. Our server was this young man, looked more like a kid. The only reason why I'm wanting to describe him was because my group felt like as if he was a relative that came in to work and was not properly trained. He looked very young. Anyway, 40 min passed and I was just about to tell our server that we were going to leave. The wait was ridiculous. We were hungry and embarrassed that we raved about this place to our friends, and this restaurant couldn't get it right. Right when I told him we couldn't wait any longer he said the food was coming out. Great! Finally. So, our food was there, felt like there shouldn't be anymore negative energy since our food finally arrived after 40 min. Well, to find out that my lunch special was the same amount of food that my friend ordered even tho his was the regular entree. My friend's dish cost more even tho we got the exact same amount of food. The waiter then realized that he mixed up my friend's plate with another customer's plate that was sitting next to us. The waiter took the plate from the other table and brought it to my friend and said, \"the gentleman said he didn't touch the food yet.\" Ewwww, how gross is that? How can we be 100% sure the other customer didn't touch it. My friend decided to suck it up and it since it's been such a disaster since we got there. Yes, we were trying to be patient and calm with every mistake that was happening. Soooo, it doesn't end there. Midway of eating, my husband realizes he didn't get his soup and his egg roll or something like that.... to be honest I can't remember exactly what was missing because this took place back in October 2016. This post is months and months late but I still can't get over how this restaurant runs. As I was saying, my husband was missing either soup or an egg roll that was suppose to come with their lunch special deal. We told the server, and he was apologetic. It was nice that he kept on apologizing but that's all he did. Come on! You could do better than that! Do something! 

We finished our food. Paid. Tipped. We talked to the lady there, I'm not sure if she owned it or was the manager. We wanted to make them aware that they were going to lose customers. Yes, we've only been there twice, but still. I go to this plaza often because of the market and every time I see Thai spice, it bothers me of how they run things. If they continue to do what they do, I'm sure it won't just be my husband and I that they'll lose. So back to my story, we told the lady of our experience and she apologized but it felt like she didn't care and that she couldn't do anything. She didn't offer us anything at all. She didn't do anything to want us to to go back there. So even tho the first experience was good, the second experience was just THE worst. 

Waited way too long for our food, messed up on our orders, gave us a dish that was given to another customer sitting at another table (definitely not sanitary), and lastly, they said \"I'm sorry\" about 10 times bc they messed up about 10 times... no joke... and nothing was done. No explanation, no excuse of why everything was such a mess. Nothing. No \"I'll discount your meal.\" We got nothing. 

So, goodbye Thai spices. Please teach your staff how to deal with situations like this. If the lady I spoke to was the manager, then you need to know how to be more accommodating and understanding."}
{"text":"It's an ok place. Not bad, but don't expect five star quality food here.

The service is good, don't get me wrong, but no amount of great service is going to make up for lower-quality food. Thai Spices serves Americanized food, not authentic Thai, despite the menu descriptions that the food is indeed so. Way too much sugar in the dishes to please American palettes.

Would I come back here? Only as a last resort, if no other Thai places were open, sure. Other than that, I'd steer clear of this place.

Upside, if you pay with cash you save a small percentage off your bill."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Kee Mow lunch combo, and my partner had the Chuchee Fish specialtylunch. Both were yummy. The Thai iced coffee was Really strong.

The only reason I deducted one star is that the server didn't ask what kind of protein I wanted. She just gave me beef. It was good, but she shouldn't just choose for me.

The lunch specials are available 7 days a week, which I love. Also, they have a pretty good happy hour that includes food and drink."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I wonder why it's not packed out the door -- the food is EXCELLENT! I really enjoy their curries, especially the pumpkin curry. The appetizer sampler platter is also a hit when I take my parents to dinner. Interesting cocktail specials, too. I brought my Meetup here a few years ago and everyone was taken care of and we had a nice low-key, stress-free event."}
{"text":"I had thai spices delivered using uber eats so i cannot say much about the restaurant. The pad see ew was not very good, very little flavor and very greasy. I ordered mild spicy and there was absolutely no spice at all just a few chopped up peppers. The crab puffs were pretty good, but little to no crab inside mainly just cream cheese. I would be willing to try something else based on the good reviews but I love pad see ew so i will not be back for this dish."}
{"text":"The foods this place are good, but price a little expensive, my son liked the Duck Curry here. I ate here a few times with my family and I am not plan coming back here in sooner or may be later. I highly recommend whom liked Thai Spices should come here and try out!!'"}
{"text":"I Love this place. I come here a couple times a week for lunch. Fast lunch time service. I get there when they open and I am able to get back to work in no time at all. I have had several things on the menu and everything is Great. They make mine Triple Thai Spicy for me and it is perfect. A couple of my all time favorites are Spicy eggplant with beef and Pad Kee Mow."}
{"text":"Had red curry chicken, the chicken itself was awesome but the reason they only get 3 stars is their rice.   Enough curry chicken for 2-3 servings, enough rice for a starving karate kid. Like seriously less than a cup of cooked rice. I asked for more rice to finish my meal and they charge me 2 dollars more for another scoop of white rice. I cook jasmine rice at home and for the 6 cents it costs to make that much rice, its really upsetting when they nickel and dime you.   You guys lost a customer for the cheapest thing you make ...,"}
{"text":"Love going here for lunch! So close to my office. The waitresses are so friendly. I usually order the lunch special-yellow curry, it comes with soup and egg roll."}
{"text":"The food was good just wish the portion was bigger. You don't exactly get your money's worth. I can't complain that much since they gave us 2 free Thai iced teas for checking into Facebook. I asked them to make it really spicy and they did! I got the red curry tofu and it was great, just small for the dinner price. Maybe I'll try this place out again during lunch cause that portion would be fine if it was with a lunch special. I didn't notice on the menu that my dish came with mushrooms so I found myself picking them out of my plate. The server (Lan) was nice and served us water as soon as we needed more. I'd give it 5 stars if the portions were more reasonable for the price until then it'll be a 4 and maybe even a 3 in the future.  The free Thai iced teas got them an extra star on this first visit. I liked that they were playing Christmas music during our whole visit and had the NBA basketball game playing on the television. They seemed to have a good selection of beers and liquor so we'll definitely have to come back during happy hour next time"}
{"text":"This place may not be the most authentic of Thai restaurants I've tried in CA but it could also be regional flavors I'm unaware of. Regardless, everything I have tried here has been spot on with flavor, freshness and my Thai cravings were satisfied. The staff is always very helpful if I need help trying something new and they accommodate my gluten allergy as best as possible while still keeping the dish true to its description on the menu. Hard to find such understanding companies willing to help those who don't choose to be picky of what they eat... This place is worth the prices and the portions won't disappoint either."}
{"text":"Best thai food I have had stateside! Affordable, beautifully presented, and delicious !"}
{"text":"ordered 3 lunch specials, eggplant, basil rice w/chicken and panang curry beef. 

egg rolls seemed stale and had corn? really corn niblets? amen the culinary courage but not really appreciated. 

soup was just a  fish sauce in chicken broth with cilantro and a slice of chicken broth.  wayyyyy to salty with no balance of tradition. very small 6oz serving. (I may be exxagarating on size)


 basil fried rice was bland, chicken was flavorless, overall taste/flavor/freshness is poor. onions were oily yucko and zucchini and broccoli in thai fried rice???? really? 

eggplant with chicken was very good.  Overall blended, even flavor profile on sauce and ingredients.

panang curry beef comes in with broccoli and zucchini? really?  that's disturbs the overall  flavor  texture of the meal to no end.  also way too many carrots in the serving. the serving is already very small but insult to injury is almost cracking my teeth on small piece of bone in the curry.

yeah, I know  I should have taken a picture.

I let the server know but might as well be speaking kurdish. she didn't do shit and looked at me like I was stupid.  I am stupid for driving 45 miles one way to try this place with my family.

the only positive in the curry was slight detection of actual lime leaves and Thai basil in the curry sauce.

positive was the beef was tender and tasty, too bad for the stray bone. also wish there might have been some potato in the panang curry or just a hint more of lime leaves and Thai basil.

Overall service was very slow for 20% table coverage if that.

I really want to give a 3 for food quality, taste, appearance and freshness  but the bland fried rice, extra fillers like zucchini and broccoli, bone in the panang and combined with small soup and entree servings  sizes rate a solid 2.

Please all you regulars tell me I am wrong or just visited on an off day."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the Mekong Plaza - my GPS kept circling - so beware. The ambiance is open and asian. The server was gracious and attentive. The food was light, fresh and flavorful. A ton of Vegetarian options! We had the veggie rolls and a pot of soup; the pot of soup had a flame coming out of the middle of the bowl. It was groovy! My date had red curry and I had pork noodles - excellent portion size!

I would recommend this restaurant and will be back. 5 stars! Solid!"}
{"text":"The food is good. I like the grilled salmon with mango salad. However the service is not so good."}
{"text":"I usually go to the pho place next door but mixed it up and went for some Thai. Amazing food and service with the right amount of spice. I will for sure be back for more. We ordered the green curry and pad Thai on recommendation from the waiter and was not disappointed. The best part of the night was the insane strawberry smoothie. Took me back to my childhood!!! It is a must go for sure!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent lunch at Thai Spices.
Sarah had aCurry dish and I had a cashew chicken.
Our waitress was helpful in helping us select how hot we wanted our plates.
We will retun"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch! Their chicken panang is one of the best I've had! I recommend ordering the Bbq pork as well, so flavorful, reminds me of home! I haven't had anything bad from their menu. Good service and prices! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the Combo #2. It was chicken satay and pad thai, I only got it at a spicy level of 3/5, would probably go with a 4 next time me. The soup prior to the meal was amazing!! I could probably do a meal out of just the soup. The environment was a little darker and not very noisy, but was told it can get busy. The wait staff was courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"The food was really good and not expensive at all. $31 for two people. We went there at noon and we were the only group there. We were very full and satisfied with the food. Recommend for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Called in to order in advance, they didn't take that option. Ok then, I'll order togo 20mins prior to pick up, was told that it would take 15mins for all 3 orders. 

25mins later, I showed up and still nothing was ready. Had to wait extra 15 mins for an order of salad.

I wouldn't come here if my wife doesn't really like this place. In fact, she keeps indicating that the food here is awesome and I found the contradict.

Anyways, I ordered 1 pad see ew, which comes as a big failure: no veggie as stated on the menu. Yeah, only noodles and some shrimps (look so naked eh) - less veggie and more paper. Why do I say that? Found a paper sticker of something (must be from one of the products) and I chew it off accidentally. Luckily I did not swallow it.

The crab papaya salad, oh yeah, the crabs taste so salty, not as tasty as I usually get.
I didn't even recognize how much the difference of dining in and taking out until now. Basically, you pay same prices for food items, but take-out orders have much less quality. 

What a shame! I'll try to convince my wife for a new Thai spot, without having to drive too far from Gilbert to Mesa."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Mesa. The Thai fried rice is amazing!!! Also love the crab puffs, pad Thai, and Tom yum soup."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Lemongrass chicken was extremely salty and I love salt. Crab ragoons was the only thing they didn't screw up!"}
{"text":"I've had the Pumpkin Tofu Curry several times, basically every time I've been here, and it's so delicious. It's a bit spicy, and for me it's the perfect amount of spice. It's sweet, rich, and creamy, and the vegetables are cooked perfectly, meaning they're not mushy but they're easy to cut into bite-sized pieces.

On the Happy Hour menu they have Buddha Gyoza, which I'd never heard of before. I was super excited when the server said it's a tofu dumpling (potsticker). I don't eat meat, and it's tough to find non-meat-based dumplings. They use some kind of textured soy crumble, so the filling looks similar to ground pork, but they're vegetarian-friendly. They were awesome.

My husband got the Seafood Pad Cha and loved it as well. There are a bunch of other non-meat items on the menu I want to try -- it's just so hard not to get the Pumpkin Tofu Curry that I love so much. 

The service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and this must be a place for regulars because our server greeted almost everyone at the door like an old friend."}
{"text":"I had a much better experience in my repeat visit to this restaurant. The service was as gracious and friendly as the last time, and this time the quality, flavors, and presentation of the food my friends and I ordered were very good; and the heat / spice level was tempered down to our liking for both appetizer and entrees. The prices were good, and the fact that we came within happy hour time brought  the already low drink and appetizer prices down even more."}
{"text":"I have to admit that my first impression with the food at Thai Spices was not very good but I'm glad I made the decision to come back and try something else. The Pad Thai dish that they have could have been a lot better. Their curry dishes are very good though and I would probably come back to have that again. I did order their curry with a request for medium spicy and I probably could have gone one notch down to the mild spicy, that seems to be the case with most Thai restaurants though for me. I have also tried their lemongrass chicken and thought it was just okay, but still would prefer to have that over the Pad Thai.

As they have decent lunch specials here I'll probably come back here every now and then, especially with the restaurant located in Mekong Plaza. I can highly recommend their curry dishes as that was the best of three lunch specials that I tried."}
{"text":"Meals for only $5!!!  It isn't just limited to lunch time specials.  I have a hard time spending $10 a plate a Thai places when they sell the same things for $6 or $7 as a lunch special.  

However this place is my next favorite Thai place now.  I just wish it was closer.  

Looking forward to trying the Pumpkin Curry soon."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review for this place since I have been a regular for so long. However, I have to say that my family and I will no longer coming back to this place. 

Recently, we had an usual family outing, and Thai Spices came in to our mind. My Dad loves the Pad Cha, and I'm  a die hard fan for the Papaya Salad. Coming in to the restaurant around 8pm on Sunday, we were pretty hungry at the time. While waiting for my family to arrive, I insisted that I was ready to order. 

The waitress brought out water and was confident that she could take my order at the time. I order 2 main entrees, and 1 appetizer. Note that she did not have any notebook to write down the order, and I found it strange. But, I do eat out a lot, so servers memorize customer's orders is not an abnormal thing. She did not repeat the order that I just made, but I trusted the service so I let her go. 

My family arrived, and I ordered a Hot Pot. My husband and I asked for extra steamed rice for the soup. We were confirmed that the food will be out shortly. 15 mins later, everything started to come out, except for 1 main entree and 2 side rice dishes. We thought it was still being cooked, so we patiently waiting. 

The final item, which was the hotpot, was brought out, and the server went to hide behind the counter and chit chat with another for a good solid 20mins. We attempted to make eye contact, but all they did was just chilling behind the counter. Soup was getting cold, and the husband was pretty upset. There was no way to flag the servers down, so I had to get up and ask for a side rice to eat with the soup. 

The waitress finally got back to check on us, and it turned out that she missed our main entree and forgot to put in the system. At this time, we were pretty much done with it, and ready for the check. 

I am pretty disappointed, because every time I go here I get a decent service and good food. However, tonight was another story. I'm sorry Thai Spices, but my family and I will cross you out of our dining list, and will find another restaurant that can actually appreciate loyal customers."}
{"text":"What can I say about Thai Spices?

It's easily one of my favorite restaurants-- not just in Mesa, but in the entire valley area. The food is top notch, and has actually gotten even better recently as they have refined some of menu items. The atmosphere is very modern, and usually pretty quiet. The staff are all very amiable and helpful whenever we're there.. A great place for lunch and dinner!

The real kicker though is the drink selection. It's the only place in the valley that I know of where you can get Phuket. For those of you who don't know, Phuket is an import beer from Thailand, and easily the best Lager I've ever had. Apart from that wonderful little gem, their speciality drinks (both alcoholic and non) are fantastic as well. Try the Thai Tea, you won't be disappointed!

I highly recommend Thai Spices for anyone looking to enjoy a delicious meal, great drinks, and comfortable atmosphere at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"2nd time here and boy, this place continues to impress me. I've been to Thailand and the way their food is very balanced (sweet, salty, acidity, heat) feels like I'm in one of the best restaurants in Bangkok. 

If you like Thai food, you should try this place and I'm confident you will be coming back again just like me. 

Recommendations (not in particular order)

1. Papaya salad
2. Three flavor fish fillet
3. Thai eggplant 
4. Calamari
5. Pad Thai
6. Crazy crab puffs 
7. Green curry with chicken

Best part, they offer vegetarian alternatives!!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have ever had in the valley hands down. My fiancé and I went here on Christmas and were pleasantly surprised with how amazingly delicious everything was. Also the staff here is extremely accommodating to vegetarians and were very friendly to boot. We will certainly become regulars here."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with soggy egg rolls, and the Thai basil dish was watering and cold.
I'll give me one more shot. And that's it."}
{"text":"Update your online menu. I can't properly order if your menu is 7 years outdated. Evidently the staff knows it, but nothing changes. I would have loved to try it if we REALLY KNEW what they served."}
{"text":"In this Asian shopping center you have many options for lunch. From a Food Court to a large indoor Restaurant courtyard. Thai Spice is tucked away from the others, just down from the the grocer. Worth the walk. Prompt friendly service. Comfortable indoor seating with plenty of outdoor light. The eggplant shrimp dish was delicious. Crispy vegetables. Lots of shrimp. The eggplant was a little sparse. Otherwise a perfect lunch. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is probably my favorite thai spot in AZ! Out of all the Thai places I have tried they have my favorite Tom Yum soup! And pad thai! Would definitely recommend this place hehe."}
{"text":"i ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and i was surprised with the portion. It was huge and so yummy. I love how they put tofu and chicken in my dish. Normally you have to pay extra for that since the dish always comes with one type of protein. I wish most restaurant in San Diego, CA would do that. 
Also, i got a free drink (Thai milk tea) after checking in on their Yelp's page.
That was nice. If i happen to visit Arizona again, i definitely come back to visit :)"}
{"text":"Out of this world!!! Be warned though, there spicy scale is +1 star from whatever you say. I love HOT, but their Thai hot will have you running for a water trough like a Warners Bro cartoon character with fire coming out your ears. If you like a good kick in the face as much as I do, just stick with 4 stars and a big glass of water. I have tried a few things, but am now hooked on the pad Thai lunch special combo. It's so GOOD!!! GO HERE...ORDER 4 STARS AND THANK ME LATER!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I was traveling home from San Francisco and a traveler I met suggested this place to me because it was their favorite Thai place. I went the night I got back into town and it did not disappoint! Very tasty with a great portion! Staff was very helpful and accommodating. I got massaman curry and it was delicious."}
{"text":"The customer service was prompt. Most of the time they are friendly and very attentive. I happen to go on a rare Saturday night. They were busy and had 2 servers. I had to wait a little while for the check. But I can't complain. The food was absolutely delicious. It's on point. I like to always attempt to try different menu options."}
{"text":"I just have to point out how efficient the waitress and hostess were during the lunch rush. Cool decor. Good food. Quick service. The ice tea is interesting in a good way."}
{"text":"I had a ridiculous craving for thai food the other night and wound up here and let me just start by saying...they have a pretty large menu. At first glance, this is in the same shopping plaza as a few other places that I really enjoy (the Com Tam place and the Snow place are in the same complex) and I figured it would look similar to them inside, and it was really nice inside in my opinion! Very large and spread out. You can tell that they definitely value the cleanliness of the establishment.

I had their pumpkin curry with chicken, medium heat, as I asked if spicy was in fact...super spicy? And the waitress implied that the hot would be tongue numbing. The flavors were really good, and yes, when in doubt, order lower for the heat! It was really delicious. My date got the Pad Thai (also medium) and I kept stealing his, it was that good.

Also, their thai tea had a cute little flower in the straw that I forgot to take a picture of, but I was obsessed! 

Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Okay.. my second time to Thai Spices..  No complaints on anything.  This place appears new, clean and the staff is friendly and attentive. The chicken satay is tender with just the right amount of spice.  Pad Thai, calamari salad all very very tasty.  The star of this meal was the Tom Ka soup.  OMG I swear it was the yummiest soup I have ever tasted.  Full of flavor, lots of meat and vegies and the presentation of course was excellent.  That flaming hot pot just made me smile, the soup made me moan!  Oh and the peanut sauce, I could just drink it from the bowl."}
{"text":"Great resteraunt. Soup is suprisingly sweet, ordered the Pad Thai Chicken lunch special that included spring roll, Chicken Satay and drink. A great value. Finished with Mango stickey rice that was well prepapred and a perfect way to numb the flames. Triple Thai hot available, however not recommended for the average consumer."}
{"text":"Im from cali and this stuff they call thai food sucks!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here again. It was good as usual, however I should have listened to the other reviews and not ordered the fried tofu, it was too soggy."}
{"text":"Having lived in Thailand for more than 30 years, I am an expert on Thai food. It won't taste like your American \"Thai food\" it will taste like Thai Thai food. Sure the cleanliness isn't the best, but those who know Thailand will laugh it off and say \"this is sooo Thai!\" It's what I love about Thailand. As we say in Thailand \"!\""}
{"text":"Limited Menu but has all the standards. Nothing unique or extraordinary. They have Lunch specials on weekdays from 11-3pm. 

I had the Pad Thai and it was very good. The noodles were good consistency and the flavors were right on. I especially like that they top it off with a lot of peanuts. yumm! The lunch portion was perfect and satisfying. It also comes with a choice of a veggie roll (vegetable eggroll) or crab puffs. I got the veggie roll and it was decent.

Good value. Tasty. Will go there again."}
{"text":"We had the AppetizerSampler, Thai iced tea, Eggplant Seafood, Seafood Pad Cha and mango and sticky Rice. Oh my Lord! This food was so yummy and fresh. The Eggplant was cooked perfectly, not too soft or mushy. The seafood Pad Chambers was a sizzling platter that was perfectly prepared. The iced tea even had a cute origami rose on my straw."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. I waited for a long time just to get a glass of water. Then when I got my food tastes incorrect and missing peanuts for pad Thai.    Last time I was there I ordered pumpkin curry and it too tasted bad. If I were you I would go to another restaurant to eat. I went to eat at many Thai restaurant and never had this experience before."}
{"text":"I had my heart set on Thai food when I hit this place up.  I was running errands with my girlfriend and we stopped at the Asian market to see what we could eat.  This is how I met Thai Spices.

I could go on about this and that and the lovely decor or how quiet it was or how attentive my waiter was.  I honestly don't give a shit.  I could have been eating in waist-deep water with an alligator feet away from me and my review and star rating would remain the exact same.

The BBQ pork that I ordered was the best pork I've ever had in my life.  The salad... eh, looks like it came from a bag and was presented in a darling fashion.  The Thai Tea was awesome (as always)... but, man, that pork.  It was so tender and juicy.  I've memorized its taste and I'm going to recreate it one day.  It may take me a while, but I'm doing it.

If my waiter had told me I was worthless, an accident, slapped me with a newspaper and then spit in my water, I'd STILL give this place four stars."}
{"text":"Delicious fried shitake mushroom and basil dish of some sort... I do NOT eat Thai food but this was amazing!"}
{"text":"Thai Spices is THAI-RIFIC!

Yelper Mark R. periodically posts these scrumptious looking photos on Yelp from Thai Spices so I thought I'd have to check this place out when I'm by this area and I'm glad I did as my experience was VERY GOOD!

We started with tasty Sweet Potatoes appetizer. They came out very thinly dipped and didn't seem oily at all. The kind of potato they used almost had a sweet chestnut like flavor and was very good. They came with sweet and sour sauce that was OK but a little sweet for my taste.

My husband had the Thai Spices Basil with the added option of making it Thai Style with Chopped Ground Chicken and Crispy soft fried egg. The chicken in the dish was moist and flavorful and the fried egg was excellent. It had a thin crisp all around it and a soft center that oozed it's richness into the dish like it should. This was a much better variation of this dish than I had at several other places in the valley. However I did think this dish needed more basil and would ask for extra basil next time we are here.

I am a sucker for anything pumpkin in a Thai Restaurant so I had to order the Pumpkin Tofu Curry. This variation did differ from others I've tried but was still very good. This version was vegetarian and made with red curry. It had a silky richness to it from the pumpkin with only just a few tasty pumpkin chunks in it. The vegetables in it were cooked just right and the tofu was nice and helped to lightened this dish. I do note the portion was very small but it was delicious and I had enough anyway.

Service was friendly and efficient.

A very SOLID 4 stars 

THAI-RIFIC! Located in Mekong Plaza"}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointing experience. Service was slow (although friendly), and the food was meh at best.  

Stopped in for lunch, had the lunch combo which included soup & a spring roll. The soup was good, nothing else was. The spring roll was cold, and the eggplant/chicken I had was bland (literally, the only flavor it had was the soy sauce and sriracha I kept pouring on it to give it some flavor - I ordered it a medium spicy by the way) & the chicken was overcooked.

Will not be back."}
{"text":"Shrimp and crab pad Thai is a complete rip off. 4 shrimp, and a dusting of sad dry krab. Notice spelling.  $14? GTFO.  The extra star is for the poor server who was on the receiving end of my disappointment."}
{"text":"This place has really great service, the servers are all really polite and helpful when it comes to accommodations and plate suggestions. They also have a self serve soup table, I think I had some kind of hot and sour egg drop with corn soup that was really delicious. They also provide little fried wonton chips to go with it and made it taste spectacular! I had the stirfry eggplant lunch special with fried tofu. I guess my food was good, but a little too spicy for my \"mild\" request. My mouth felt like it was on fire, I think maybe they made it hot? The rice was also a little soggy. However the eggplant was cooked really well. The pad thai was also very good and the portions are great for $6 specials. I liked the veggie egg rolls a lot, they were really tasty

And kudos to our server for letting me watch the nhl playoffs instead of the lifetime movie they had on tv. She was really nice about it!"}
{"text":"Very good food despite super slow service. I had the BBQ pork and it was crazy good. They have a good happy hour too! 
I highly recommend it if it's your first time having Thai. Check out the market right next door too."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a good Thai restaurant and we finally found it! Thai Spices has an amazing selection of delicious options, all for a great price.  We've been striking out with other Thai restaurants in the Valley and are so happy we found Thai Spices - will definitely be our go-to take out place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Spicy Eggplant lunch special. The portion was just right and the taste dead on. I love how the basil punches through without totally overwhelming the dish. I will most certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in the east valley.  You can't go wrong. Everything is delicious and the service is excellent.  Try the pumpkin curry!"}
{"text":"Finally, an authentic Thai restaurant on the east side! Being Thai, my standards of Thai food are high, and none of the Thai restaurants in Phoenix (except for Siamese Kitchen) has ever met my expectations. But now I can count on Thai Spices when I don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"SOLID & CHEAP thai option that offers better thai than Tucson does (from what i've tried thus far)

LARGE PORTIONS, i could not finish my dish
---pad kee mao: PERFECTLY cooked noodles w/ a nice variety of veggies, yumm

interestingly enough this casual restaurant looks like it's connected to the supermarket

NOTE: you can choose your level of spice & medium spiciness was perfect for me"}
{"text":"Family owned thai restaurants are incredibly consistent.  I have yet to have a bad Curry, Pad Thai, or Stay.  It is always very vibrant and flavorful.  Thai Spices carries on that tradition of consistency as everything was good and to our expectations.  Nothing more, nothing less. The location is diverse and clean.  While it had the customary pictures of Thai royalty on the wall, the decor was decidedly different and contemporary urban. 
All in all a good spot.  A solid candidate for the best thai in Mesa."}
{"text":"This place is boom af. So delicious. I high recommend seafood pad cha, phuket lemon fish, pad thai, and shrimp and crap fried rice, try to be healthy i could possibly get by sub white rice for brown rice."}
{"text":"One word to describe your review on Thai Spices: Waaah!

This place is doing it. We haven't found a more tasty Thai place in the Phoenix area. 

The ribs, BBQ chicken, papaya salad, their curry, egg rolls, crab puffs--all bomb. And they have Phuket beer, which is always satisfying."}
{"text":"This is in the Mekong market center.  We stopped here after shopping due to unexpected hunger.

We ordered meals which came with soup.  The soup was very sweet.  I didn't recognize it as a Thai soup.  It was \"ok\", but I can't really say I liked it.  I certainly wouldn't order it separately.

I have the panang pork.  I requested medium heat.  It really wasn't medium.  There was a little heat, but not nearly enough to be medium.  Flavor was pretty good, though a bit sweet.  My wife had the fish with a panang sauce (I forget the name on the menu).  It was REALLY good.  The fish had a delicate flavor, and the panang worked with it.  Though, again, it was sweet.

Overall i think \"a-OK\" works.  I can't bring myself to four stars here.  The soup was not great, and the panang shouldn't have been so sweet (I have had a lot of panang over the years, and this is the first time it's ever been sweet).  Service was adequate.  Friendly enough, but only moderately attentive.  No real complaint there, but again not enough to bump me to four stars."}
{"text":"Thai Spices is sooo yummy and lots of vegan options (vegan family here) and they were very accomodating with menu and service with our energetic toddler which always makes a dining experince great or terrible. We went for lunch and it wasn't very busy so the waitress was very attentive and kind. The food has tons of flavor and it's not dry... I hate dry food."}
{"text":"This is AWESOME! I enjoyed our visit. Very clean and super quick from start to finish. The prices were on part with most Thai places. This one stands out by their curry. I ordered the masaman curry and it was one of the best I've had. I would recommend spicing it up a bit though. I did a #3 of spice and it didn't bring any bite whatsoever but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places ever! I don't come around as often any more because I moved a bit west. However, when I lived in the Mesa \"hood\" this was my place to stop on almost a weekly basis. Curry and Pad Thai are super delicious! Also had a favorite waitress that knew my name and voice when I called, great customer service. I miss those days"}
{"text":"Really good food. Haven always been satisfied with everything I have ordered."}
{"text":"This restaurant is sooooo good and I have made several recommendations about the food, yesterday we went and we so exited !!!!   I ordered the sweet and sir chicken, having it before I was super excited.  The chicken was reheated and had a rubbery consistency and tasted funny not fresh.  I couldn't eat it, I have never had a bad  experience before what method wad used to make that chicken taste so bad.  So sad."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my husband after work because of the lunch specials and happy hour menu. We ordered:

Veggie Rolls (4 pcs) - $2.95 ; came out piping hot and crispy! delicious! 
New Zealand Mussels - $6.95
Yellow Curry with Chicken - $7.95
Seafood Pad See Ew - $10.95
Chicken Pad Thai - $7.95

All lunch specials come with a veggie roll and soup. 

Veggie Rolls - D E L I C O U S, it came out piping hot and crispy! 

Soup - this soup was on the sweet side and came with one piece of thin sliced chicken. 

New Zealand Mussels - it came in a fancy little pot, which was cute. It has great taste, not dry at all and as a bonus it came with a side of sweet chili sauce for dipping.

Yellow Curry with Chicken - it had a very rich tasty flavor. The carrots and potatoes we very tender, which I LOVE! 

Seafood Pad See Ew - the crispy fried fish was sooooo good! I think that was the best thing on the plate! 

Chicken Pad Thai - it was okay, I've had better. 

Customer Service was GREAT! Water was always filled and the waitresses were very attentive. 

The only thing I was confused about was that when you check-in on yelp, they offer a free Thai Tea, but when I showed them the check in, I was informed that that offer is no longer valid!! I was sooo confused as to why the offer is there when you check in. The waitress however honored it and advised this would be the only time they would offer the free Thai Tea. 

Overall, great experience and quick service!"}

I love Thai food!   I moved to Mesa a few years ago and have been looking for a Thai restaurant to impress me.  Everything I have had here has been very good.  I think most Thai places have a few dishes that are excellent.  I recommend the Spices Basil, Peanut Catfish or Special Eggplant."}
{"text":"Came here to try their boat noodle. Base off the noodles I tried here it was a huge disappointment the broth was lacking flavor. It's all about the broth. This review is based solely on their Thai Boat noodle."}
{"text":"My all time favorite spot for Thai food. The lunch special comes with soup and a spring roll for about 7 bucks and it's a decent portion of food. I've been going here at least once a month for the last 5 years. There is one server who has been there forever and is amazing and friendly, however if she isnt there I don't expect good service. A couple times i have waited over 15 mins. before i was even greated on very slow days. Still worth it for the food."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, small portions....

So I am a big fan of papaya salad! It was one of my daily foods in Thailand so I know a bit about it... The papaya salad here is good but suck a small portion... I am a big guy so I need a big plate!

Service has always been good.... 

Food has been good every time.....

I just need more to eat!

I would have given 4 stars for bigger servings..."}
{"text":"Needed to change it up from all the BBQ I was eating, and randomly decided on Thai Spices.  Ok, I lied...AA Wholesome Bakery:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/aa-wholesome-bakery-mesa#hrid:Du4wIG5ktu3GqqAeHFjqfg) is in the same complex :P

Pad Kee Mow:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=KkVkifgnEk1d60wVCwixNQ .  I like a little spiciness with my thai dishes, but the levels (low, medium, and high) all vary!  Thankfully, the medium spiciness here, was aligned with what I considered medium :)

Thai Panang:   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=jf6GntlWc0n8L__ehq8ROg .  But this was my favorite dish, the curry was so rich with flavor and had a nice kick to it. 

Up until this point, Thai Spices locked in a 4 star rating, until I ordered a side of sticky rice ($2) to eat with the rest of my curry.  I wish I took a picture, but the rice was served in a little bamboo container, and when I lifted the lid, there was rice wrapped in plastic wrap.  

WTH is this?!  $2 for rice that's barely half my palm size, AND it was served in plastic food wrap!  0_o"}
{"text":"incredible we come here probably every couple of months,  for probably a couple years now.  NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT,  Love it"}
{"text":"I was happy to find this place while on vacation in Arizona and spending the night outside of Phoenix. Is this the best Thai food I've ever had? No, but it was still very good! The pad Thai was yummy, and the spice was just right. If you're a spiceaholic, the Thai hot may not be quite hot enough for you though. My friend got the yummy duck curry. The curry  was delicious but the duck itself close to inedible due to bone and gristle. For the price though, I'm not surprised. Who can afford to waste duck these days?"}
{"text":"A decent Thai place. Ordered the pad see ew and pineapple fried rice. One thing I would suggest is to order everything with medium heat. We asked for the spiciness to be 4 out of 5 and it was kinda spicy. Elisa ended up with a stomachache."}
{"text":"Thai Spices easily has the best Pad Thai in Arizona, as well as amazing service to match the quality of their food. Thai Spices even has delivery on Fridays - Mondays! I love eating there for the lunch specials and exploring new dishes, but it's hard to not just order the Pad Thai each time I order from them."}
{"text":"Okay food but awful service. Restaurant had 5 people in it when my party of three sat down. It took almost an hour for the food to hit the table once we ordered and they didn't offer any sort of compensation. Thai food should not take that long to prepare, this isn't fine dining."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, although not overly friendly! Prices are reasonable. Our favorite dishes are the thai basil and panang curry!"}
{"text":"First off, let me preface this by saying that having spent many years living in Thailand, I am a Thai food snob and am ridiculously picky about the Thai restaurants I recommend... 

That being said, this is by far the best Thai food in the Phoenix, and surrounding, areas. My first experience was after having a tooth pulled. I needed to eat, but it needed to be soft, and I was craving Thai. So my amazing partner ran over and grabbed me some Pad See Eew and an order of crab  puffs. 

The Pad See Eew was the best I've had outside of Bangkok. The flavours were perfectly balanced and it absolutely reminded me of home. They weren't stingy with the protein (chicken) and it didn't seem to be an Americanised version of one of my favourite Thai dishes. And the crab puffs... My partner had a couple and her response to them was, \"These are the best crab puffs i've ever had!\" Not your usual wonton wrapper stuffed with cream cheese with virtually no crab, these are filled with cheesy, crabby, seasoned goodness. So much flavour packed into such a little pouch. And they're served with a sweet chili sauce for dipping. 

The second time we ate there, we actually went to the restaurant. It was around 3:30pm on a Saturday so we were pretty much the only people in there. I ordered a Thai iced tea and my partner got a green tea. My Thai iced tea was perfect. Not to sweet, unlike many of the other Thai restaurants I've been to. The green tea was a little strong, and my partner says she's just going to get water from now on. Not because the drinks are bad, but because unlike the majority of restaurants, they serve purified water. Not tap water. MAJOR brownie points there! 

We, of course, started out with the crab puffs, which were just as good as the first time. I ordered yellow curry with chicken, and my partner ordered the cashew chicken, both Thai hot. Ordering food \"Thai hot\" can be hit or miss. Many places see the ginger hair and pale skin and figure they can dumb down the Thai hot and I'd never notice. F*ck that! When I say \"Thai hot,\" I mean \"Thai hot!\" And that's exactly what we got. 

The cashew chicken was phenomenal. The smell alone brought back to living in Bangkok and eating at the noodle shop across from my school. It was spicy enough to make my nose run and leave that warm, tingly feeling in my mouth and throat but still had incredible flavour. My partner said it was \"amazing.\" (She's not quite the foodie I am, so for her, that's a high compliment.) My curry was pretty damn good, too. Spicy, flavourful, full of large pieces of chicken as well as all the other good stuff (potatoes, carrots, etc). I could smell it as soon as it was set down and I knew it was going to be hot, and I wasn't disappointed. We had enough left over to take home and have for breakfast the next day. The portions are more than generous.

Our server was extremely attentive. Almost overly so, but I was glad for that as opposed to being practically ignored, which can happen when you're the only patrons in a restaurant. He came over at least twice to make sure our food was ok, and always made sure to ask if there was anything else we needed, ie. napkins, more tea, water, etc. 

Being so stuffed I didn't get a chance to try their mangoes and sticky rice, but it's on my list since it's one of my favourite foods ever! 

The menu is extensive, with all sorts of noodles, stir-frys, curries, etc you can imagine. They have a lunch menu served daily til 3pm (including weekends) that have the same dishes for $6.75, which is what we plan on shooting for next time. 

If you like Thai food, this is a must-try!"}
{"text":"Oh, Thai Spices, how do I love thee?

I really enjoy my visits to Thai Spices. The service is always fast and friendly.

I love the yellow curry! I also like the soups they have. Both are delicious. This past weekend I tried a Thai Coffee and it was wonderful.

I recommend a visit to Thai Spices."}

{"text":"Great Thai food in Phoenix!   Credentials:  I eat a lot of Thai food in San Francisco (hometown, traveling here on biznatch), and have been to Thailand, so y'know, I'm not a noob and I know what authentic tastes like.

My dining companion and I were both thoroughly impressed with Thai Spices.  Dishes:

Tom Ka (with shrimp):  Thicker than any in recent memory, but the flavors were all correct just not quite a delicate and balanced as the very best I've had.  .   but overall quite yum.  

Green papaya salad:  Ordered this spicy and it was!  Tingly toungue and blowing my nose, prettymuch just how I like it.  Flavors were not bad, not sure what was slightly off but still, great and the best I've had in Phoenix.

Seafood Pad Cha - Mmmm, this was really good.  Intense, savory, minimal sauce over perfectly cooked seafood.  Nothing was overcooked.  

Mango Salmon - My friend got this one, and said it was excellent.  

Prices are excellent.  Service was very friendly.  

Would def. come again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love stopping at Thai Spices whenever I'm in the area. I used to live down the street and would eat it at least a couple times a week. My fiance and I just made a special trip a couple of weeks ago drove 45 minutes both ways, and it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"My friends and I like going here, but my last experience was SO disappointing that I don't think I'll come back again. 

My husband and I came here for dinner and I ordered the grilled chicken dish. It came with a salad, rice and a pretty large serving of grilled chicken.

The salad wasn't that great as it was doused in some kind of mayonnaise dressing. The flavors were fine, but it was literally a serving of mayonnaise with a side of salad... I moved on to the chicken and after cutting a slice off, we noticed it was pretty pink inside.

When the waitress came by, I asked her what she thought and she said she was sorry and took it back to the kitchen. She came back and said they were making a new one. My husband's food was already out and I would have preferred they just threw the chicken back on the grill, but it was too late.

Anyway, my husband finished eating and still no sign of my plate. Just an apology and affirmation that it was still being cooked. I asked to just get it boxed so I could take it home and eat later. They didn't even try to comp me for the dish, but whatever.

I didn't get a chance to eat it that night, but the next day I was looking forward to having it for lunch. When I opened the box, I noticed they replenished the mayonnaise salad. Next, I lifted up the first piece of chicken and I couldn't believe my eyes!!!

IT WAS THE SAME PIECE OF CHICKEN THAT I CUT A SLICE OFF OF IN THE RESTAURANT. There it was, the same \"NEW\" chicken that I waited over 20 minutes for. The best part? ALL OF THE PIECES WERE STILL PINK AND LOOKED RAW AS EVER.

Screw you Thai Spices (yes, I'm mad)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite thai places. I really love their shrimp and crab pad thai here. The flavors are perfect. The crab meat in the pad thai is super yummy. I also enjoy their Tom kha soup(coconut soup with mushroom and chicken) . The spice level here is not as spicy I would usually order hot. :)"}
{"text":"oh, i'm so torn!

possibly the best thai green curry i've ever had (with EGGPLANT!!!!), and a really amazing pad thai....  but definitely pass on the banana fritter. it was.... over contrived with fruit and chocolate sauce drizzled haphazardly all over it.

yet.... freakishly high pricing!!! bah! i was definitely spoiled living near tons of amazing and cheap thai places. i was hoping to make this my thai food take out go-to.... but the high prices have sent me back out on the search.

we had a livingsocial deal, so we ended up here.... OH! and the weird bill fiasco.... apparently their computer system isn't able to total and then take a discount off, so the owner ended up taking off like... $18 instead of $20, as our coupon stated, because taxes weren't included? no matter how many times i did the math, it didn't make sense. we ended up waiting a long time because the waitress had to call the owner...  long story short, we got our $20 off, as stated on the LS deal. left a bad taste in my mouth.

i would go back if i was really craving their curry... but chances are, i'll just figure out how to make it myself at home."}
{"text":"I was so hungry and ordered a large bowl of Thai Boat Noodles. It was satisfying. Checking in also got me a free Thai ice tea!

My friends loved their curry. It was super spicy.

The selection was decent with some more expensive entrees. I opted for the noodles because the large cost 11 dollars. Other dishes were around 17 dollars average.

Overall good experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing. They play great music. The girls working there (especially the little one with the glasses) are ALWAYS so friendly. 

The food has been consistent since the first time I've gone. I've eaten there over 30 times and I've never once tasted anything off. I've never once gotten sick from it either. The Yellow Curry and Tom Ka Soup are my two favorites. I love all of the happy hour items as well. 

They have a full bar. The bathrooms are super clean as well."}
{"text":"Second time for dinner... if you're in the area, give it a try but not worth driving for. The food was good but not great...food came out fast but drink service was extremely slow and this was on a Thursday night with only 3-4 tables full. Doubt I'll give it another shot, way too many other places to try!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, authentic flavors, clean environment. A gem in mesa arizona. I especially like their BBQ pork, pineapple fried rice, and crab pad thai. Best thai iced tea, too :) Can't wait to visit my friend in Arizona again and dine at this place!"}
{"text":"They have a great lunch special with a pork chop and pad thai, the food is always consistently good and they do a good job of making it anywhere from Thai Hot to no spice at all depending on what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Very yummy and gluten free.  I like the curry"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Clean and inviting restaurant! Will definitely be back! Awesome find for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Mesa.  It was one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever eat at in my life.  Not only was the food excellent, but the service was superb.  We were able to get the flat noodles and also a rice dish.  I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Can I get a wha what?  This place ROCKS!  I like Thai food and eat alot of them but this one really is awesome.  I have my favorite foods that gives me an idea on how good a place is by ordering those my first time in a place.

Chicken and eggplant is fantastic.  Their sauces are really well seasoned and has lots of depth.  Pad Thai is always great.  Service is amazing but food really is awesome.  Chicken satay is fantastic with the peanut butter sauce which is mixed just right with other spices.  Yummo!

Check it out!  

I seem to find myself there almost every week.  :-)"}
{"text":"My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!

We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  

For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! 

One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .

My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!"}
{"text":"I had a Basil fried rice and my husband got a pak kee mao or something like that. My basil fried rice was on the saltier side and his noodles tasted like they've gone bad (but he said that's how it usually tastes like..we'll see when he gets home lol). I'm not sure if I want to come back..but my husband seems to like it. Service was good though."}
{"text":"We have been here two weeks in a row. This place was suggested to us by my daughter. First time dinner and a have to have Mango and Sticky Rice. Oh and calamari. So good. Second time we had the most exceptional waiter(Joon) I hope I spelled that right. He explained the heat level better and choices for noobies for food. I went from a 3 to 4 and was very pleased in heat. Yes I broke a sweat with that one. He welcomed us to become regulars. I love the way dishes are welcomed to be customized. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved nearby, and I don't think I am ever going to cook again.  I love this place!

The lunch specials are great--7$ for a soup, spring roll, and choice of entree.    The dinner prices are also totally reasonable. 

The food can be a bit on the spicy side--I usually like my food medium, but I always make sure to order it mild here.  My spice loving husband usually orders medium.  The spice is always nice a flavorful, not just a burn.  Yum!

The portions are large (we always come home with leftovers) and the service is great (my soda is always refilled before it's empty).  This is my new favourite place to take out of town visitors!"}
{"text":"Freaking best Thai food eva! Low everything I've had there. I will definitely be making this place a frequent stop in my endeavors of satisfying my cravings!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love Thai Spices, but since my last visit - I am not sure if I will be making any trips over any time soon. I ordered the usual Beef Panang as well as Thai Fried rice. When we got the order, the beef panang was more like \"panang with little bits of beef, carrots, and big 2-3 inch chunks of zucchini\". The Thai Fried Rice, same thing - big chunks of zucchini, lettuce and onion! WTH?! Was someone too lazy to cut up the vegetables? Here's a tip: Go buy a food processor - it can cut the vegetables for you in just a few seconds!

I was not impressed - I'm a little ashamed because I've recommended this place to tons of people (look at my last yelp review).  The service needs to be improved too! We were rarely acknowledged and for a restaurant with 2-4 customers other than us around, there is no excuse for not acknowledging us."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for lunch.  It's average.  

The Pad Thai ($7.95) was so/so.  It lacked flavor and the noodles had a \"spongy\" texture.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=OCCiEEum8v0DRHQScPUURw

The Fried Rice was pretty good.  Fresh Veggies and just the right amount of Egg.

The Egg Rolls ($2.95) were above average.  Not too oily, crispy, had good flavor.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s5TJlFtdXcx_tXC4tlttlw?select=kflj_odI0WlvqxVylF1I8Q

Everything else was just OK.

Not worth the drive from Scottsdale to Mesa.

Return Factor - 30%"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the Roaring Tiger. The BBQ pork was passable, but the sticky rice accompanying it was dry and hard. Overall, the service was 5 stars, and the food 4.5
Chicken Satay was good."}
{"text":"It hurts to write a 1-star review for this restaurant.  That being said, do not alter a time-honored and familiar recipe.  There is nothing wrong with an addition to the  recipe, as the additions can be requested left out of the order.  However, it is wrong to replace ingredients that make up the basic presentation of the recipe.

This afternoon, I found myself in Mesa for a shopping trip  to Mekong Supermarket.  We have a potluck event coming up at work and I wanted to scope out the place ahead of time for the ingredients I will need.  Seeing the sign for Thai Spices, the trip offered a chance to stop for lunch after I checked out Mekong Supermarket.

On entering the establishment around 1:30 PM, I observed a clean dining room, with a pleasant ambience.  On picking up the 'take it home' version of the menu, I read through and saw what appeared to be suitable offerings for a Thai restaurant.  As always, I looked for Som Tom, green papaya salad, the yardstick by which I measure all  Thai restaurants.  Finding green papaya salad listed, I was gratified.  

With no indication whether I should seat myself or wait, I waited.  From entering to being greeted and offered a table, it was about 5 minutes.  There were about 10 people seated in the restaurant, so the wait was, in my perception, reasonable.  When the host came to me, he asked if I would prefer their table menu.  I responded that I found what I wanted, and I would like to be seated.  

As I was guided to a table, the host advised I would see my wait person shortly.  He asked what I would like for my beverage and was quick to bring the water with lime I requested.  My waitress arrived shortly after and asked what I would be ordering.  I placed my order for papaya salad, omitting shrimp and long beans, served Thai Hot, along with an order of steamed jasmine rice.  The waitress asked if I could clarify my order, hot being 1-5.  I requested 6.  She wrote down the order and asked if I wanted another beverage in addition to the water.  I declined, and she went to the kitchen, advising I could anticipate a wait of 7-10 minutes for my order.  Sipping water, I waited for my order to arrive.       

My order was presented at about 8 minutes.  The salad looked to be reasonable, about 2 cups and the rice about 1 cup.  Som Tom, properly made, should have lime, chile, palm sugar and fish sauce, each of which brings tangy, sweet, salty and spicy notes with the crunch of fresh papaya.  

On tasting the salad, I got lime, vinegar , garlic and spicy notes.  The spice was about 5 on a scale of 10 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes).  I caught the waitress' eye and when she came to the table, she asked if everything was satisfactory.  I told her that the salad was missing some ingredients, specifically fish sauce and palm sugar.  She apologized and took the order back to the kitchen.

3 minutes later, she returned with the same order, though it had been doctored with fish sauce and granulated sugar.  The chef had not remixed or even replated the order, only put fish sauce and granulated sugar on top of the previous order.  I asked the waitress to return this version to the kitchen and requested a new presentation be made, without the vinegar.  She went to the kitchen and returned with the same plate, telling me that the chef would not make a new order.

I asked for the bill, and requested consideration as the order I wanted was not what I anticipated.  The waitress apologized and asked if I wanted to speak with the manager.  In replying that I would, she said the manager would meet me at the register.  I went to the register and on asking for consideration, the manager advised me that the salad was prepared exactly to my order, with no beans and no shrimp.  When I asked why vinegar was used instead of fish sauce, she said \"That is how it is listed in the menu.  Did you not see that?\"

I paid my bill and left.  Oh, I have regrets...yes, I have many regrets."}
{"text":"There are many Thai restaurants in Phoenix metro area.  Thai Spices has our vote as one of the few authentic Thai restaurants.  They have some really authentic Thai dishes, and use the correct ingredients as you find in food in Thailand.  Other Thai restaurants use substitute ingredients in their dishes because it's cheaper.  One example is using cheap broccoli instead of the correct Chinese kale in the stir fry and noodle dishes. Thai Spices always uses the CORRECT traditional Ingredients.  Their service is outstanding, and warm and gentle just as in Thailand. If you really want authentic Thai food, you've come to the right place here."}
{"text":"It really depends on what you order here. This place is open late so we decided to try it out. They have a $5 menu all day as well, which could be a make it or break it deal to come back. Nice, relaxing place to chill and the service is good.

1) $5 Papaya salad with crab. HECK TO THE NO!!! It was overly salty, fishy smelling/tasting, with old dead crab shells. I thought it'd be at least some imitation crab, but no. It was nasty crab legs soaked in with the vinegar. The papaya was way too sour and salty to enjoy.

2) $5 Chicken and noodles. It sounded just meh, but it was actually really good with lots of chicken (surprisingly) and other veggies like mushrooms, bamboo, onions etc. They gave really little angel hair pasta but the flavor of spices was really good. Decent in terms of legit pasta (rather get it from a Chinese restaurant).

3) **GREEN CURRY. The curry was really good here. It was the right balance of sweet and salty. They gave lots of veggies and meat in their curry as well. We ordered beef, which unfortunately was a little chewy.

All in all, a decent meal...great when you are starving and craving something with flavor.

Thai only spiced me up to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in AZ. The service was quick and professional, the restaurant was very clean, and the portions were more than enough considering the price was very reasonable. I ordered the Massaman Curry and it really brought me back, easily just as good as what I've had back in Cali. My boyfriend got the Yummy Duck Curry, and he loved it as well. The duck had so much meat on it (it wasn't all skin, thank god) and the rice was great too. I also checked in and got free Thai Tea which is amazing! Definitely recommend and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great Thai lunch spot! Staff is so friendly and quick service. Wonderful lunch specials with good variety and selections.  Their curries are all excellent along with my favorite, Spicy Thai Basil!

If you're in the area, definitely stop by Thai spices for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute delight. The pad Thai was perfectly cooked. You can tell the chef truly enjoys what he does. He has a real eye for detail. However, once I tried to open up a checking account not only did they tell me it wasn't a bank, they looked at me with a confused reaction. I was also appalled to learn they did not provide child care services. I was trying to enjoy my meal without my precocious toddler and learned that was not an option. Overall I give it 4 out of 5 stars. God bless."}
{"text":"Very, very good.   Attractive decor - clean & modern without being stark (or bizarre). Great atmosphere.  Food was excellent and spiced to order.  Very reasonably priced.  Service was friendly, competent, and attentive.   Men's room clean and in good order.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Thai Spices is at the far south end of the Mekong Plaza, next to the Aa-Ozzy bakery, which I LOVE. The inside doors were tough. I thought they were locked and they wanted you to enter from the outside door. Boy did I feel dumb when folks were coming and going from those doors after I made the man walk to the front!
We were seated right away and given menus. We waited forever for our drink order,  then eventually she took our food order. They served me before his meal even came out of the kitchen. I'm not a fan of staggered service. So I sat there staring at my food for a few minutes before his arrived.
The lunch menu is in effect even on the weekend, which is cool. Cooler, because they are pretty expensive for Thai. J opted for the BBQ pork combo, which came with chicken pad Thai, soup, soda and a fried spring roll. The BBQ pork was a boneless pork chop. It looked nothing like the picture in the menu, and didn't taste like BBQ pork. The pad Thai was mediocre. 
The tofu panang was also mediocre. I ordered it mild, but it was still pretty spicy. I ordered brown rice, but still got white. The soup had too many onions and one baby piece of chicken. I also thought it was too sour.  The Thai iced tea was also bland.
We weren't offered dessert, which we were contemplating. But boy, it was expensive!  We waited again forever for the bill. The gal kept walking by us, but finally took it. We didn't know if we were supposed to go up or wait for her to take it. 
We'll probably pass this place by in the future, with so many other options in the plaza."}
{"text":"Excellent! Ordered delivery via GrubHub. Boyfriend had red curry chicken (Thai hot) and crab puffs, and loved both. I had tofu satay (one of the best tofu items I've had from any restaurant anywhere) and pad kee mow with tofu. Also great, much fresher-tasting and less greasy than similar dishes at Thai Basil. We've found a new favorite place for Thai food!"}
{"text":"This was nice place for not being in Thailand. When I go into a Thai restaurant I like to feel like I'm in Thailand by the smell. You eat with your eyes, nose then by taste. I didn't get that experience here. 
That being said the Spicy eggplant was ok, it really was missing flavor. We asked for the heat level to be a 4 out of a 5 rating. The chef was spot on with the level. We also had the BBQ Pork. Can't really mess that dish up.  So in my eyes the chef gets a rating of a 3. 
Now the wait staff.  The waitress that waiting on us this afternoon was sweet. We enjoyed her honesty with everything we asked her. The service she gave us was a 5 out of 5. Most Asian restaurant that we've gone to don't come back to the table to check on you and to see how the food is. This young lady did. 
So my over all rating is a 4 star."}
{"text":"Reading all the great reviews really makes me think I simply ordered the WRONG items!! First of all, I have eaten and worked at several Thai restaurants- so I really do appreciate authentic Thai cuisine. I ordered the soup and yellow curry with Tofu. 
The soup was more like stew- vegetables lightly covered in a very thick broth, almost like a gravy. I was not a fan of the taste at all- this was some rich stuff. The curry was indeed  tasty, but again- a bit heavy on the coconut- so after about 7 or 8 bites I just couldn't handle it.  Because of my check in, I earned a free Thai tea- which I didn't even bother to take advantage of because of the sheer richness of the meal itself-which I did not finish anyways. Lesson learned for me- WAH WAH.I just wouldn't try it again for the price, not worth the risk."}
{"text":"I will be surprised if this place is open another 6 months. Not because we were the only ones there from 6-7, not because you couldn't find a bag for the carry out container, not because the food was bland and tasteless. Because there are so many other great choices at Mekong that try to at least appear to care. Step it up or step aside."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I love spicy food that they have and very friendly staffs. Would love to try noodle and fried rice as well"}
{"text":"Pad se ew was too greasy and sweet. Their fried rice is soggy and also greasy. Also, it's made with brown rice, yuck. Service is slow. Definitely not one of my favorite Thai places. I did like their Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Yesterday afternoon, the Thai restaurant closest to my house had adjusted their hours, so I decided to give Thai Spices a shot, despite the pricing. I ordered one pad Thai and two cha yen and had them delivered via Grubhub. The delivery man was on time and had good manners. I initially felt sad that I spent thirty dollars, however, once I received and enjoyed the generous portion of the pad Thai, I had no further complaints. I had typed special instructions via Grubhub to remove tails from shrimp, and thankfully there were none. My only pet peeve is the cup size of the cha yen and amount of ice; it leaves much more to be desired. Otherwise, it appears Thai Spices is my number two spot for ordering Thai food and I plan to order again should the nearby Thai restaurant not be available."}
{"text":"My favorite thai place in the East valley! The food is always good and the service is great."}
{"text":"Be warned. Thai Fried Rice has zero flavor! When I called thinking something must be wrong they confirmed it's a bland dish with no flavor even at medium they only add chili flakes for heat. No \"Thai\" seasonings what so ever. Steer clear."}
{"text":"We passed this place so many times every time we go to Mekong market, but we never attempt to eat here.

Tonight we brave  enough to try this place (we are kind of picky with Thai food because we only like the authentic one).

Actually it wasn't bad at all! The food came quickly and fresh. It was delicious and I think we'll be back again next time."}
{"text":"Recently have been disappointed in this place, as the service is appallingly slow and the food quality has been slowly dropping (mainly looking at the Chu Chee Fish). Here are some of the dishes we've tried:
- Chu Chee Fish: great flavorful panang sauce with crisp breading on the fish. However, the sauce will be spicy even if you order it at the \"no spice\" level- speaking from experience. The thickness of the fish has noticeably dropped over the months we've eaten here.
- Yellow Curry w/ Chicken: a decent amount of meat with the curry; my only complaint is the lack of rice that comes with the dish"}
{"text":"Not too bad, not too great. Stopped in for lunch with a buddy at Mekong Plaza. We both got the #2 lunch combo which was BBQ Pork and Pad Thai. Overall everything tasted fine other than the pork being a bit tougher than expected. Solid place and the prices are fair, i'll most likely be stopping by in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing , all i can say is that the food is incredible and the service is good first I wanna start by saying that the egg rolls are far the best I've ever tried i always order 2-3 orders for my self i usually get the pad kee mow i believe it's spelled that way it is sooo good I have it hot, Thai hot is wayyyy too hot so i would recommend if your trying to enjoy your food ."}
{"text":"I want to put 3.5 but I settled  for four stars (I'm kind of a fan) (note: i haven't ate a ton of Thai foods)
I would never go out of my way to eat at this place, but I've been here a few times.  Granted I'm not a connoisseur or a frequent eater of Thai food, I do like this place. The food is quite yummy, it has yumminess, but it won't have you craving it.  The presentation is truly beautiful.  One other thing my family and friends really like about this place is the humongous servings.  None of us, could clear the table.  Usually I can eat my portion, my neighbors and help one more person, but I could barely finish my own; the extra spicy that I ordered helped me eat all my rice though :). I think of one my favorite things about this place is also the friendly service.  Of the three visits, the service has always been courteous, smiling, and very friendly/helpful. I would suggest this place if you happen to be in the neighborhood or within 10 minutes driving.
What I had the last time I was there:
Green Curry
Chicken Curry
Some Kind of Noodle dish :)"}
{"text":"I only tried the pad thai for lunch but wow! I got so much food for the price! Plus it was easily one of the best pad thai dishes I have had. I ordered mine with chicken and hot and it was perfect! Super impressed and definitely coming back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"One word: bleh. I know my Thai food and this place was about 1 star, an extra star for the nice service. I came here with my mom, uncle, and aunt and being my first time, I opted to order my usual pad see ew. We also ordered coconut fried shrimps, the mango papaya salad, tom yum soup, and fried rice. Honestly, the best thing about our order was the coconut fried shrimps. It came out hot a crispy and flavorful. Everything else needed help. 

The fried rice was too overwhelming, it tasted like too much fish sauce and was very salty. The Tom yum soup was a little bland and we had to add fish sauce to it, and the pad see ew was way too darn spicy for being a \"mild/medium\". It was full of this unpleasant pepper flavor that I definitely wasn't use to in my pad see ew as well. My aunt and uncle think that the place hired a new head chef or something, because since they're regulars, the food this time around was definitely not worth the bill. We ended up to-going 60% of the food untouched so that we can tweak it ourselves at home to our liking. 

All in all, there are other places around town with better food - 1 star. 1star for the friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time in Thai spices and first time trying yellow shrimp curry. The curry was medium (3) spice. It was my first time trying yellow curry I didn't know what to expect but if definitely met my expectations. I bought the lunch combo which included the shrimp curry , steamed rice and a small egg roll. 

The curry sauce was delicious, I mixed my rice with my curry and i fell in love, and the egg roll was good along with the sauce they provide for the roll ... but the only item I didn't care for was the shrimp. I only got 3 medium sized shrimp on my curry and the rest was veggies . I wish there was more shrimp on my plate, but for the price I can't really complain it was less than 10$. 

Will I go back? Maybe.."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about a dozen times, and it is very good.  It's best to go for lunch, as you pay less than the dinner price for the same food."}
{"text":"Allow me to start by saying that this is finally a place where you can get a plate of pad Thai, or curry with rice included for 10 bucks. Having been to Thailand and paid no more than $3 for an amazing entree, I get a little disgusted going to places and seeing a curry dish for $13 and another $2 for an order of rice. 

I had the green curry and it was off the chain. Definitely one of the better that I've had stateside. The only downside was that there was about just as much sliced ginger as there was other assorted vegetables, but nonetheless it was delicious. I got the lunch special so it was only $7.50 with soup and an egg roll. My wife had the pad Thai and that was also one of the better pad Thai dishes I've had."}
{"text":"Excellent, spicy thai at good prices.  The som tam salad is one f the best in the valley and spiiiiiicy!  Ask for medium unless you want to die.  Their lunch specials are an excellent value."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Real modern inside with a FULL BAR!

We got the Pad Thai and Tom Ka Kai. Both were maaaad flavorful! MMM!! The soup was probably one of the best Tom Kas I've had, even though it was more on the creamy side. 

They got a happy hour here and the prices are reasonable. Service was great, overhead music was great, and its in the Mekong Market so you can get your grocery shop-on before/after. Highly recommended if you're in the Mesa area!"}
{"text":"Everything was sooooo good! Panang curry with chicken, mango sticky rice and crab wontons! The wontons were super crispy and not doughy. Just a thin wrapper! MUST HAVE!"}
{"text":"We got the pad Thai, Tom yum noodle soup and sausage with sticky rice. The sausage had good flavor but was too dry.  It comes with a TINY side of sticky rice, also too dry.  The worst part was that there was a small but distinguishable piece of raw chicken on the lettuce that the sausage was served on.  The pad thai was ok, a little too soupy though.  The noodle soup had a hint of Tom yum versus a strong prominent Tom yum flavor."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai place in all of Tempe/Mesa. I tried other places like Thai Basil, Thai Elephant, saBai Modern Thai, Smile Thai, but I always find myself coming back to this spot. Their food is the best seasoned and has the best level of spice. 

My favorites are the Mee Krob for a sweet and crunchy start, Yellow Curry with chicken or shrimp for a good classic spice, and the Pad See Ew for a rich savory main course. 

The service has always been great, both dining in and taking out, and the full bar makes a good environment for a nicer dinner out. Would highly recommend over other Thai places in the area."}
{"text":"Very good foods but the price isn't very good. 
Would recommend  if you are rich and love enjoying thai foods."}
{"text":"After giving this place a few more chances, I've come to discover their yellow curry to be PHENOMENAL! They also have a special pumpkin curry sometimes which is amazing as well. Definitely worth the trip for the curry alone. YUM."}
{"text":"Mee not krobby

OK....pretty bad pun but couldn't come up w anything better.

It was good! Service was prompt and nice. Prices were reasonable. Portions were decent. And though I'm not sure how it's possible to sanitize the little basket thingy with the rice in it, I couldn't help myself and had to open the little basket and enjoy the sticky rice inside. It was nice and nutty and yummy.

I had the marinated pork and it was guuud. Tender and tasty.  I also had the coconut shrimp which were also good. 

I didn't give 5 stars bc it was just good...maybe even very good but not raving fabulous. If I lived in the area I would come again. If I come back to AZ for a visit not sure I'd go out of my way to come back necessarily. But good. Really good."}
{"text":"All I have ever ordered was the chicken pad thai for take out. Takes them like 5 minutes to make usually, never longer than 10 minutes. I would reccomend a 4 out of 5 when they ask how spicy. Its very hard to hear and understand the hostess whenever i order on the phone. It's absolutely awesome, I wish the portion was bigger, then again I scarf down Pad Thai like a starving dog. If you like thai food this definitely needs to be a place you check out."}
{"text":"One word that describes Thai Spices is \"meh\".  

Located in MeKong Plaza, it took over the old BoCa 7 space.  When walking in the place, you'll notice its nice decor.  alas, it was left behind by the previous tenant (yes that is real gold wall paper fyi).  The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday.  Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere.  Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their appetizers.  The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related.  The crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings.  Who would of thought the secret sause (thousand island) would make a diffrence.  After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there.  The thai dishes were not very good.  We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small.  Also the green curry was salty, i have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking.  But it was good though, good with rice that is.  Also even though we got it \"mild\" it still had a healthy kick of spices.  The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side.  The Tom Yum soup was good.  Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off.  Again this was a lil on the salty side too.  The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab.  That has a unique after taste.  

So in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you.  But its not a place you'd actually actively seek out if you werent literally already there.  

Pros:
-happy hour specials daily 4 to 7:30Pm (supposedly)
-great happy hour specials that are actually delish!
- great decor hahahha

Cons:
- food is sub par
- thai specialties are sub par
- thai tea wasnt a home run.
- prices are not reflective of the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"The portions are terribly light on the protein and veggies.... But heavy on the starch (rice and noodles). Additionally, I wasn't thrilled with the pad Thai or the soup either. The green curry taste the same as the red curry... Maybe a little more red pepper in the red curry. The customer service was slow and rude even though there were only four other patrons in the restaurant. I would pass on this restaurant next time."}
{"text":"What a great find. We stopped by late Sunday afternoon. Very few people were there when we arrived. It happened to be Happy Hour, so I tried a Thai Tea Tini; Thai iced tea with a kick. I had a crab appetizer - can't remember the name but they were a sweet creamy crab filled fried wonton. Yummy.  My husband had veggie spring rolls. Also good. He then had green curry with chicken - his go to dish at a new Thai place; I had 3 Flavor Fish, which was a large fish fillet, fried and served over steamed vegetables. It was all covered in a dark, peppery, sweet, soy glaze. Amazing. My husband said the curry was some of the best he'd had, and I'd never had anything like the fish. It was delicious. The food was excellent, it's not at all expensive, but the service, while quite friendly, was a bit slow given how few patrons there were. We live in North Central Phoenix so I'm not sure when we'll get back there. But if were in Mesa, it will definitely be on top of our list."}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is legit when you see Thai people eating here!

I ordered the Pad Kee Mow instead of my usual Pad See Ew, and thought it was very delicious! According to my taste buds at least, I could say that their 1-5 scale (1 being not spicy at all, 2 being mild.....up to 5 = spicy party in yo' mouth!) is pretty accurate. I got the level 2 and thought it was very good. Presentation of the dish was also very nice.

Great, friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced from a restaurant. Manger didn't give a crap if the food, service or anything else was sub-par. Will never return."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly, served me pad Thai and BBQ pork for lunch. The meat was perfectly cooked and expertly spiced. (Thai hot is their hottest setting, just on the edge of perfect just needs a tiny more of a kick) the tofu was ok, not great but all in all a fantastic mood, food was great and it was pretty fairly priced. 10.99 for lunch combo which was too much food for even me and unlimited soda. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went here this evening with the boyfriend for dinner because I have had a wicked craving for pad Thai, and let's face it Pei Wei's version mad me sick to my stomach. 

We were greeted by Anna as soon as we walked in. She sat us and got our drinks all in one fell swoop. She was smiley, nice and very prompt with any refills we needed. 

I went in specifically for the pad Thai but after pursuing the menu I was tempted to veer and order many other things, but opted for the mild chicken pad Thai in the end. Morgan got the chow mein with beef and medium heat. For an appetizer we did an order of crab puffs since they were on sale for happy hour. 

The crab puffs came out in about 5 minutes and holy cow, they were so good!!! The wanton wrappers were great by themselves but the filling was so good, and when paired with their dipping sauce they were fantastic. There were 6 in the order and usually we would split them but Morgan lived his so much I gave him one of mine. :) 

Next our entrees came out almost as soon as we had finished the appetizer. The presentation was nice, the smells were delectable, and the portions, huge!

My pad Thai was almost perfect for me. The sauce was so yummy, a little on the sweet side for some people maybe, but that is how I like mine. I should have ordered it with no spice though, the mild was a little much for me, I guess I've turned into a wimp over the years haha! 

Morgan loved his chow mein. He said the medium spice was just right for him and left his sinuses cleared. He also loved the huge chunks of veggies, still crisp and flavorful in addition to the sauce. 

Our whole bill was 29.95 for two drinks, two entrées, and an app during happy hour. All in all a great experience. And they deliver on the weekend, yay! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and it was amazing. The food and the service. I was taking a late lunch and both my phones were blowing up and the hostess told me not to answer my phone anymore, take a break and enjoy. It was just what I needed!!"}
{"text":"Brought the kiddos for a (relatively) early dinner on Father's Day, and were pleasantly surprised. Good food, perhaps the best pad thai we have found since moving back to the Valley; the staff were friendly and attentive to all of us, kids included; the prices were reasonable, and there were even happy hour discounts on several kid friendly dishes!  A good time."}
{"text":"The food was okay this was our second time there but it was overshadowed by the horrible horrible service we were left without drinks for an unbelievably long time then when I went up to the bar to ask for a refill I was ignored for the person on the phone she kept talking on the phone even as she took drinks and appetizer out to another table she stayed on the phone the whole time then when we were waiting for our check it took forever also it was just a horrible experience the service was the worst ever we will not be going back"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and tasty! The Roaring Tiger and Lad Na are my favorite dishes but the curries and of course Pad Thai are delicious, too. Portions are generous and the service is spectacular. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a pumpkin tofu curry ($7.95) and tried some roaring tiger and Thai boat noodle soup. The pumpkin curry had a thick red curry with perfectly cooked veggies and silken tofu. It was flavorful and just the right amount of spice (I requested medium). The roaring tiger came out in a sizzling platter. The sizzle and smell was amazing! The beef was marinated well. The Thai boat noodle soup was a large portion, with tender beef, rice noodles, and a lovely tasting broth. 

Service was uneven as we had attentive service initially, but then the waiter forgot to refill drinks and check up on us as the meal progressed. 

The prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. If you're in the Mekong Plaza area this is a tasty option for Thai!"}
{"text":"The lemon grass chicken is the most insanely flavorful, most delicious dish I've ever had in my life. It's like fireworks of salty, spicy, sweet, umami miracles are exploring in your mouth...99% of the time I'm the happiest I've ever been when I eat it. Occasionally the pieces of chicken are too big and it doesn't have that amazing crunch that I love, but luckily even when the texture is a little off, the flavor is still there. My husband gets the BBQ pork and loves it. He's also likes the yellow curry, not the best we've ever had, but still very nice. He got the Pad Thai and I wanted to gag it was so sweet, but maybe that's what it's supposed to be like, I'd never had it before. The staff is super nice. Just make sure to order the freaking lemongrass chicken, mmkay? Oh, and I get \"no spice\" and it still has a definite kick. My husband who likes spicy can only handle \"low spice\". They aren't messing around here."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. Spices & sauces are right on. We had Pad Thai, Panang Curry, Veggie rolls & crab ragoons. Highly recommend! Friendly service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came in today for lunch and ordered the Pad See Ew w/ beef lunch special w/ soup and veggie roll.  The beef was really tender and it was good, but a tad too sweet. I tasted a few granulated sugars.  I ordered mediums spice level and it was very mild, so I will order the next level next time. The veggie roll was really good, it had corn which was different.  The soup was okay, it was lemongrass I believe, and a little spicy.  I will definitely be back, worth giving a try."}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave this place a second chance. I had a much better experience on my latest visit. 

My husband and I went for dinner.  There were only two other parties in the restaurant, so the hostess seated us immediately. I got a free Thai iced tea for checking in (Thanks Yelp!), and we ordered two noodle dishes. 

Our food came out quickly, and was very tasty. The portions are large, and the price tags are small. Best combination!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. Amazing quality Thai food that never disappoints us. The employees are always so friendly and accommodating. Good prices, and a lunch/dinner punch card. After 9 meals, you get the 10th for free. Yes please :)"}
{"text":"I eat here once a week or even more.  As far as service goes, Loc or Moon are on top of it----they are very attentive and will take care of you.  I'm addicted to the massaman curry, but I've also loved the salmon with panang, the tom kha, the barbecue pork, and the calamari salad."}
{"text":"Awesomely relaxing ambience, good music, and amazing food. The wait staff is attentive without being invasive, the food is excellent while affordable, and the decor is Thai yet modern feeling. One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am very picky when it comes to any Asian cuisine as I frequent the 626 area code quite often while visiting my family in CA.

So I give this place 4 stars. Wait staff is attentive. We came here with 7 people and everyone left very full. We started with the Tom Yum soup (make sure you stir the soup real well prior to serving to really mix up the spices). The Pad see ew and Pad thai were both a big hit. The Thai boat soup was just ok. The BBQ pork and Salmon mango were tasty. We also ordered the fried calamari (in my opinion nothing special) the papaya salad was ok I have had better but overall not a bad experience. 

I wish they would have family style meals but other than that I would recommend you to try this place out. We will be returning."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. Being honest, most thai restaurants are just overpriced and aren't good.. but Thai Spices, omg authentic AND prices are great! Super friendly/down to earth waitresses and great service. I especially love the 10% discount they have on yelp! But even without the discount, I'd go here anyways :D Great atmosphere and great food, like.. what can get better than this?"}
{"text":"Very good stuff! Not too many Thai places around Mesa can compete with this place. Definitely be mindful of how spicy you want your food to be- ours was medium and it was very hot! Still enjoyable nonetheless. Worth a visit if you're looking for some killer Thai food."}
{"text":"What a great place. I ordered pad Thai - Thai spicy level and a hot sake. They were really really good, and spicy. The food overall was super delicious.

As for the service, the waitress was really kind and friendly. I even got a discount for some reason hehe. That's another reason to like the service there. I'm coming back"}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Spices probably between 30 and 40 times--at least half of these times were with my friend John P who should have a review somewhere here, too. Everybody who works at this restaurant knows John by name.

The food is really good here. I strongly recommend trying something off the Traditional Menu because not only are the dishes different than your typical Arizona washed down Thai restaurant, but because the dishes are under like 6 bucks.

But the real reason John and I keep coming back? Phuket beer. Phuket is very difficult to find in the valley, but Thai Spices is always stocked full of it. There was even a time where they didn't have it for like 3 weeks and John and I expressed our disappointment. Not long after, they restocked and have never been out of stock again (at least every time I've been there since).

4 stars because I still like Thai Basil's food quality more (in Tempe near Tops Liquor)."}
{"text":"I ate here 1 week ago and loved it so brought the family to celebrate my sisters birthday. The food this time was not good- the curry was like soup, my brothers pork dish had a seafood flavor. 
When my sister asked for a clean glass on her soda because it was sticky from the meal we were told that if you get a new glass we have to be charged again for a whole new soda because the manager gets mad. The restaurant was not busy but we continually had to bus our own table."}
{"text":"Be sure to check out the FREE Thai Iced Tea deal on Yelp. Their Chicken Tom Ga soup is awesome! Customer service is prompt, friendly and efficient. Nice laid back atmosphere and a FULL BAR! =O)"}
{"text":"I love coming here for their lunch special!! The food and service have been excellent every time. I usually order their lunch combo with Pad Thai and BBQ pork. For $10.95, they also give you a veggie egg roll, a bowl of white rice and a small serving of Tom Yum soup. And for $1 more, you can also upgrade the drink for Thai ice tea! Score! The Pad Thai is on point and Pad Thai is my way of testing whether or not a Thai restaurant is legit. The BBQ pork is generous size and the veggie roll is crispy. The soup is delicious as well. Will come back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out this place yesterday. I was up in Phoenix doing a photoshoot and decided I would go hangout with some friends from Phoenix and go grub. My friend suggested this place, which is in Mekong Super Market, so I gave it a shot. To begin with the name really gives off what it really means. You are warned by just reading the name and seeing \"Spices\" This place can be a bit spicy for those with sensitive mouths to spicy foods. The setting of the restaurant is really nice, it's well clean and decorated giving that Thai vibe. The waiters here and funny and sociable, they even cracked jokes which I love! Nothing beats be able to have some laughs with other people while checking a new place. I went and started off by ordering a calamari appetizer. It was alright, it was like calamari rings with a spicy sauce for dipping. The sauce was a bit creamy with a kick, which went well with the calamari.

For my main entree I went ahead and ordered the grilled shrimp papaya salad. I really don't cook much of my own cultural food since I'm on a healthy eating diet so my fitness diet just consist of chicken and rice. So I do miss food that goes back to my roots and I love papaya salad and the spicier it is the better! This papaya salad came with 2 grilled shrimp which I never had shrimp with my salad before so that was a first for me. The shrimp complimented the salad very well, tasting that grilled shrimp added with the papaya and spice. Oh and to mention I got the hottest spice they could put it which they call \"Thai Spices\"! The food was was great! It really was as close to homemade papaya salad that my parents make at home, well minus the shrimp. But overall it had the right spices and a little bit of sweet taste along with the kick in the face spice. Overall I am impressed, I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've had crappy Thai food before...this place is the real deal!  I recommend the Pad See Ew and the Yellow Curry.  Bonus:  they have happy hour that last until 7pm...what's not to love?"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I just paid $60 for this.

We ordered Pad Kee Mow, Appetizer platter, Pineapple Fried Rice and Lad Na with an extra side of noodles.

The Pad Kee Mow had zero sauce on it. It was dry noodles with pepper, chilis and vegetables.

The appetizer platter had cold cream cheese crab rangoons, cold spring rolls, cold sweet potato \"fries\", with warm chicken skewers. The chicken wasn't bad and the rest crumbled as you bit into it. 

The pineapple fried rice and Lad Na were the only two items that were edible. I'm sure I could have made due with the other items but after spending $60 and driving 20 minutes to pick it, I shouldn't have to.

Disappointing. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Pad See Ew!  It's what I always order or the Dragon Noodles if they serve it.  Wow me with the Pad See Ew and it's all good.  How's this place do, well I was wow'd and in sweatin' -- fire breathe!  I generally gage a Thai place by how well their fried noodles taste.  Kudos -- however, I can't say the same for the appetizers.  Fried Tofu need more crunch!  Our service was excellent and don't \"Phuket\" the beer :)  Great HH prices on the drinks. I like the ambience, but I wish Thai restaurants would get more creative with their design.  I know it's a Thai restaurant when I see one. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We heard they were having a special on \"boat noodles\" for five dollars a bowl so we stopped in to try them.  They were absolutely perfect.  We had the beef noodles, with generous chunks of beef and beef meatballs in a dark rich broth.  They are called boat noodles because, traditionally, this type of noodle was served on the river from a seller in a boat.  In Bangkok, these are usually very small bowls.  Here, they are American sized and a bowl is a good lunch or a light meal.

A simple thing, done perfectly.  And at five bucks, quite the bargain.  We'll go back for dinner some other time.

This restaurant is a bit nicer than the average Thai restaurant in terms of ambiance and the service was rapid, quick and bilingual."}
{"text":"I visited for lunch during the week, and ordered a Thai tea and Laab Ga, a ground chicken salad. They have lunch specials, but I was here for a craving, so I had to satisfy it. The Thai tea was delivered promptly, was tasty and had a nice touch of a flower from the straw wrapper, served in a tall glass. However the glass is not large and they don't offer one refill on the tea, which is $4, so I was disappointed. The Laab was a nice portion, but without any lettuce or cabbage, and was very, very tasty. But I ordered it for the rest of the 'salad', as the dressing/sauce is so yummy, and there was none. So I requested some additional lettuce, for which I was charged $1. I personally think this should have already been a part of the dish, and was once again disappointed.

Overall, the food was quite tasty, but I probably won't return as the value wasn't there, and there are many other Thai restaurants I need to try."}
{"text":"I have been to at least 20 or so different Thai restaurants across the Valley over the past year. I drive a lot for work and enjoy Pad Thai at least once a week. 

The Pad Thai at Thai Spices is one of the best I have had here in AZ. Very flavorful and delicious. The Pad Thai alone was enough to ensure repeat business from me. The Pad Thai is very good, but their BBQ Pork is SPECIAL!!!! I get their lunch combo with Pad Thai, BBQ Pork, spring roll, rice and soup for $11.50 and it is a steal. That BBQ Pork is just amazingly delicious. I can't speak highly enough of it. 

I've also tried their spring rolls, coconut shrimp and crab puff appetizers. All are very good. 

I found Thai Spices 2 weeks ago and have already eaten there 5 times. It's that good."}
{"text":"Dropped in about 630pm to test out what Yelpers described as an excellent rendition of Thai recipes. I was the 2nd customer in there, got instantly greeted/seated and went ahead and ordered the Beef Massaman curry at a medium spicy level for $11. Quality was superb, with a really deep, rich flavor and plenty of beef. Any normal person would do well on a classic entree and appetizer combo (apps being slightly discounted from 430-7pm here) to satisfy their hunger...

Having been eating at buffets for dinner and stuffing myself to big-belly status most nights this past week I was conditioned to want at least two more bowls of the stuff ;)

Overall very impressed by this first try, though I have to admit I can get more value elsewhere for my $11+tip!"}
{"text":"The THAI BASIL is sooo good. But trust that if you pick 3 from 1-5 hot is fire in your mouth lol"}
{"text":"Great service! We had a fantastic waiter Toan! He was funny and provided efficient service.   We have been here a few times before - meals are hit and miss. Tonight was a bit of a miss on the Panag Curry for me, but others really enjoyed the *hot* pad thai and cashew chicken. My favorite part of the meal was their Tom yum hot pot soup! It was delicious and had a a great depth of flavor."}
{"text":"Tried the pumpkin tofu curry and it was great! Went during happy hour so got the spring rolls and edamamme for under $3 each and $4 cocktails! Overall everyone really liked their meals. Only complaint is the water glasses looked a bit grimy"}
{"text":"My \"Go-To\" Thai food restaurant.. everything is delicious, the building is absolutely spotless and the food is amazing... I pick up \"to-go\" regularly and will continue doing so."}
{"text":"This place has great fresh food .
I have never had a item I didnt like and I have NEVER EVER had bad service.
They lunch specials are cooked and delivered in a timely manor.

Did i mention The food is really really good!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was on the gummy side, but not terrible. Crab puffs and spring rolls were good. Service was poor. Friendly enough, but there were three of us, all our dishes were delivered at different times, and two were incorrect."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night to celebrate because I freakin passed my driver's license exam..!! Nbd. :p Anyway, the place was surprisingly not that busy.

Food: 

Appetizers - Veggie Spring Rolls were delicious! My husband was surprised I liked it because he thinks I'm a carnivore and don't eat any greens. Seriously though, it's good.

Meal: We loved the Panang Chicken Curry. The Pad Thai was alright. They could've used better noodles.

Drinks: They had an offer on Yelp so we got one free Thai iced tea for checking in. I think that's awesome.

Service: Excellent! The waitress was more than happy to agree with me when I told her I don't like super spicy food while my husband sits there staring at us and muttering \"Wusses*. 

We loved our first visit. We would definitely be back try the Yummy Duck Curry!"}
{"text":"Told them no MSG because I have an allergy. They promised they'd make it without it. They lied. Too bad because the food was done nicely. 
Between that and charging my wife 2 dollars for more broth in her soup (without even telling us there's a charge) we're going to have to continue our quest for legit Thai in AZ."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch today, this place looks clean and it's quiet. They food is decent. We ordered a papaya salad, siracha wings, chicken pad Thai, and beef pad Thai. Over all is delicious."}
{"text":"So addicted to this place!!! I love the Thai Fried Rice!!

Love Swan!! She knows me by name now!!! 

Food is flavorful and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Excellent green curry! They do a great job of making their food flavorful and spicy. The turn around time for takeout is very fast, usually under 15 minutes."}
{"text":"The prices here cant be beat. And the Ambiance was great as well. Friendly servers light music was playing. Great portions at dinner time, and I'm sure on lunch its a deal too. Some places have tight parking lots but not here. I managed to pack it in and I will be a regular here when i need a Thai Fix."}
{"text":"Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...

Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.

We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.

My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.

I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.

My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.

And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.

Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried \"By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own\".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.

BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.

I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!

After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables \"Mujumbo hielan friacah\" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: \"Great manly warrior\"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: \"Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage\".

I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exercise"}
{"text":"The Shopping center it's in is great, so many choices. This place is very very good. Simple meals done fresh. The service was fantastic. I don't often eat Thai and the waiter took all the time I needed to answer questions, check on us, and keep our drinks filled. Very good prices. Going back again this weekend!"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy.

The massaman curry here is a winner. They have really good lunch specials that come with white rice and a side of souo.

The papaya salad is another favorite of mine here. You can pick how spicy you want it. We usually go with Thai hot."}
{"text":"Extremely pleased with service and entrees. I travel to Thailand and have many Thai visitors in my home. The Panang curry, Pad Thai, and green curry were great, even though I had to order everything mild due to my guests."}
{"text":"We always eat here and it's always amazing! We love everything about this restaurant. Our waitress always knows us by name no matter how long our visit Gap. Her little comments are always so funny and by adding that little touch of remembering our favorite dish or drink just ties into the fact we love it here!"}
{"text":"Poor service and rude staff. The food is decent at best but definitely not good enough to justify the poor service or unfriendly staff. Also, noodles tasted old, not fresh. I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"So disappointed last time we went here.  They used frozen vegetables instead of fresh in a stir fry.  Gross."}
{"text":"This place is great! Huge menu and they are very accommodating so you can switch things up without a problem! We tried the sampler and everything was delic! I created my own vegetable and rice plate and added some eggplant. They have such a wide variety in ingredients here you are bound to find something you will love. Lover boy enjoyed his curry. When we pulled up I was not expecting this place to have a bar BUT they did AND I was like duh, totally thankful (yes I just pulled out my white valley girl).

I will like totally be back to eat here again, like totally!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place when we are craving Thai food! Pad See Ew and the Pineapple fried rice are out go to meals with the mango sticky rice for dessert! The only complaint I have from our most recent visit is that they seemed to put very few shrimp in the fried rice to the point we had to dig through it to find a piece or two. But overall everything was delicious."}
{"text":"First time trying Thai food and I thought it was awesome! A friend recommended the place. I went in the late afternoon and it wasn't very busy, but more people came in while I was there. I liked it being quiet- we had good service and the food was ready pretty quickly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hm.

To be very honest, I am on the fence about this place. I can't tell if the food is so authentic that the pad thai is like none I've ever had before and I'm not used to it...or if the food is just so mediocre that the pad thai was underwhelming. It was by no means terrible, I just wasn't very impressed. I'm struggling to find words to describe it, but I guess we can start with slightly flavorless and almost sour??? I'm not sure. I was a little disappointed since it had such a rating on here, but I would be willing to give the place another chance with a different dish.

I got the pad thai lunch combination, which included a veggie roll and a small cup of soup along with the noodles. The veggie roll was a veggie roll. The soup was good, but slightly unsuspecting. It was like a sweet gingery lemongrass broth with one small slice of chicken in it. I also got a Thai iced tea that was good.

Overall, the food was just so-so. The place is clean and neat, service is fast, and my server was the absolute sweetest."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food we've had in Phoenix.  Rivals the better THAI restaurants in SF.   Fast friendly service.  Highly recommend and would go back again."}
{"text":"Horrible place! First time just wanted soup said sorry can't help I'm so busy with my table!!! What kind of response is that????"}
{"text":"Uhm.... Hands down 5 stars. BEST Thai food I've ever had in AZ! I wouldn't recommend just one item... I would recommend trying ALL of them. I don't remember what we got last time but ordered an array of items and they were all delicious. I'm NEVER disappointed when I come in. The service is also phenomenal. :)"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars!!! Im a regular at this place, and I have to say the staff know me and my wife by name.. The red and green curry is the best in town. I highly recommend this place.. I've tried many thai restaurants, and nothing comes close to Thai Spices!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday with a friend and I thought it was pretty good. The prices were great, for a lunch special (soup, rice, spring roll, and entree) for 7$... that was really good. The soup was good, a little lemon grassy, but good. I ordered the pad kee mow, which was noodles and veggies... it was good, but I ordered it medium spicy, and it wasn't spicy at all. I really liked the spring roll, it had corn in it, which was kind of different and cool. So overall, it is a good deal, but I have had better thai food.... I still might come back here as it wasn't bad by any means and it is close to my house, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Generous portion sizes, pleasing presentation, and nice service and nice atmosphere. The medium spice was a bit hotter than expected, and the ginger binger chicken was a bit heavy on the soy sauce. Tom kha soup was quite good, powerful onions though.  
I would come again, but will check out the next few places first."}
{"text":"The food was good but didn't stand out to me. I got a shrimp and crab fried rice, as well as an eggplant with chicken stir fry, to go. The portions were very large and the prices low, which is always a plus for takeout. The fried rice was a little heavy on the oil but it was tasty. It had four or five shrimp and I really liked that there were plenty of veggies in it too (cabbage, onion, carrot, broccoli). The eggplant stir fry had a nice kick to it at medium spicy and the chicken was tender. I would get takeout here again for sure. My only complaint is that they didn't include any utensils or napkins, but I didn't think to ask either."}
{"text":"Heard from a friend about this place. Food seemed to be priced well. I got the pad Thai and it wasn't bad... not great but good.  The appetizers were pretty good. I guess I was expecting too much."}
{"text":"I was really craving some good Thai cuisine and Thai Spices definitely cured my craving! I ordered the Thai Veggie Rolls and they were perfect--great appetizer if you are vegetarian, only  wish I have about them is that they come with more than 4 rolls because they are delicious, especially with the plum sauce it comes with--very light and yummy. I also ordered the yellow curry with vegetables and rice. The yellow curry was so scrumptious and hit the spot. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Thai Food.  What really impressed me is their papaya salad which is delicately chopped (great knife skills is a must so the sauce will mix evenly in your mouth) seasoned with lime juice and raw lime peel which is finely done.  Their Coconut broth Chicken Soup with lemongrass is also heavenly and spiced properly even with a western pallet.  The Riverboat soup is good but the beef is a little tough but the base of the soup is excellent and well seasoned-little on the salty side.  Too bad they didn't have fresh sugarcane juice but settled for Thai coffee instead and all are great.  All for $5 each so the bill was in mid $20 and we had a great time."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch with coworkers, and just now for dinner, and am treated to exceptional Thai cuisine each time. The lunch specials typically check in around $8, and for that you can get delicious Pad Thai, or a creamy and decadent Panang Curry. The service is also friendly and always willing to make a recommendation. This is my go-to Thai place in the valley!"}
{"text":"Loved all the food we had for lunch! (Tom yum soup, chicken curry dish, pad thai, and spicy catfish dish.  ) We shall return!"}
{"text":"We tried this place from using Uber Eats because we were too lazy to pick up food from our regular Thai place that we like.  I ordered the Tom Yum Soup with tofu.  What I liked was the flavor of the broth, the large chunks of tofu and other vegetables (although I wish there were larger pieces of mushroom).  What I didn't like is that I ordered medium and it was in reality a \"hot\" level.

I also tried the sticky rice and mango.  They give you a LARGE portion, but the sticky rice was not quuuuite to my liking.  Something about the texture was off.

I did not try their curry, but I will note that they use the plastic takeout containers and for the curry it was filled about 2/3 of the way whereas with our usual Thai place they fill it all the way up.

I would eat here again, but I still prefer our usual Thai place better."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer of this place. I love the food here but the service is terrible. The last time I came here was a Saturday night after I got off work. 6 of us came in but 2 of my friends left shortly after that, before we ordered. We saw the promotion for free Thai tea if we check in on Facebook so we did that. 3 of us checked in and showed our server, the very thin lady, but she denied because she didn't know how to check in on Facebook (???) What's the point of giving the promotion but not knowing how that works? She seemed like she didn't want to give us the tea. We ordered an appetizer and main entrees but never got our appetizer. When she brought our dishes out, we asked about the appetizer but she argued with us and blamed us for not ordering that. When my friend paid at the front, we were charged 18% gratuity even though there were only 4 of us (???) He saw the extra charge but he was so tired of arguing with this lady who couldn't distinguish between right and wrong and didn't know how to do her job right (as a server) so he just paid it. When we asked another server about the Thai tea, she happily gave us the tea after checking our Facebook. The thing is that there were 3 check ins but they only gave us 2, so we asked our server about the other tea, she said we already paid so if we want the tea we had to pay for it (????) 
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!
I WILL NOT RETURN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Thai cuisine is a perfect blend of flavors - salty, sweet, sour, bitter and spicy.  Almost every Thai dish combines all five tastes.

How does Thai Spices fare?  Not that well.  I had ordered the Phucket Lemon Fish even though I also had my eyes set on either the Shrimp and Crab Pad Thai or the Yummy Duck Curry.  Since my dinner companion got Pumpkin Curry, which I fell in love with at my favorite Thai place by the initials of CTF, I decided to get a fish dish instead so we can share.  Two curry dishes just doesn't give much variety.  

So the Phucket Lemon Fish was disappointing.  I also have a sneaking suspicion that the fish fillet is of the frozen variety which is a bummer since Mekong Supermarket is right across the hallway.  The lemony ginger sauce it sits in was bright and flavorful.  Too bad the fish didn't retain any of that flavor.  The Pumpkin Curry with chicken was okay.  The curry had a very mild flavor, the chicken was a bit dry, and the pumpkin was sadly overcooked.  As for the mango smoothie, that was probably the tastiest thing we had during the meal.

I'm honestly not a big eater but I definitely walked away from the $28 dinner hungry.  Portions are small, price is a bit high for what you're actually getting, and the service is mediocre.  It's not the worst place I've ever been to but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I so love this place.  My favorite dish that I can not find anywhere else is the Crab/Shrimp Thai Fried Rice.  If you like seafood as much as I do, this is a must try dish.  Service is very friendly (a little slow).  The resturant is always clean.  On several occassions I have phoned in my order and when I arrived, they had it by the door and ready to go.  They offer: mild, medium and hot spice.  The medium is as spicy as I can take it without setting my taste buds on fire."}
{"text":"Boy, this place is so tasty.  If you check in here, you get a free thai tea which is a plus.  These are my top favorite items:

Tom Ka Soup:  It is soooooo tasty!  I wish I got a bigger bowl and it's very unique.  The spices and ingredients are very complimentary that make a delicious Thai soup.

Chuchi Fish:  Very tasty if you like fish and curry.

Thai Spices Basil:  It is a dish that has Chicken or Pork sauteed with broccoli, bell pepper, carrot, zucchini and onion in garlic sauce.  I like the chicken one and I thought this would come dry, but it is a wetter dish with sauce.  Regardless, it was very tasty, meaning the spices made it delicious.  It is also kind of spicy, so if you don't like spicy, make sure let them know.

If you don't like spicy food, you can ask for no spicy food and they can change it for you.   Overall, for the prices and the quality of food, I think this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the Thai restaurants in Arizona and this remains my favorite. Granted, I don't get too adventurous with the menu, but sometimes when you find something you love, you just have to smother it to death, right? Pad Thai and Curry ALL DAY. I've ordered some other items (curry fish? or something) and they are enjoyable but I typically go with the same old same old.

Soup is always tasty. Thai Tea is almost worth the trip on its own. Lunch prices are fair and portions are good. I may be biased because I'm a regular but I'm a regular for a reason. Order the Pad Thai with Chicken and/or the Red Curry with Chicken and you'll know why I go back again and again."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and had their ChuChee fish lunch special which was delicious. Very flavorful and different. Nice size portion and came with soup, spring roll, rice and vegetables. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus/Krisha/Buddha, whoever! I love this place. Their approach is modern,  but the flavors are classic. I don't know how to express this, but their food tastes...clean: Fresh, bright, quality ingredients. They take pride in what they do here.

I eat so much from Thai Spices, that it hurts...seriously. But I can't stop eating.

Anything is good on the menu: Really
Mango Sticky Rice - A+++ (Creamy, sweet but not too sweet, with tangy mango)
Lemon Fish - A (Light bright and flavorful)
Pad Thai (Best I have ever had was here)

I am going to stop writing since I am slowly entering a food coma.

OH and remember, when ordering Medium is Thai Medium!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Pad Thai I have had for 10 bucks or under!

I am forever thanking my buddy Ryan for getting me into Thai food for this place specifically! 

The service was adequate and the atmosphere as well! The food was definitely the highlight. (Which is the point of a restaurant.) 

I will definitely be coming back here! (Possibly tonight.) 

BB's Rating: Thailicious"}
{"text":"Thai food---delicately prepared, gracefully presented."}
{"text":"Love the food and the people. But not to pleases with the forced 18% gratuity. I would like to tip because I want to not because I have to. So one star off for that."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had in a long time. The service was great and the food came out quick and hot. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I order a Thai ice-tea and it tastes awful. My friend took a sip and he agrees with me. I cannot describe exactly how it tastes like other than it is a mixture of the taste of Thai ice tea mixed with Thai food (before I have my meal). However, the meal that I ordered was quite delicious. I wanted a medium hot beef noodle dish and I did like it. They were generous with the beef and noodle portion. 

The service was nonexistence unless you asked for things. Servers are polite but not very attentive. We had to look for them to give us refill while we were there. 

I did come here once before and their curry chicken was good. I will probably come back here again for food...but won't expect much of a service."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is the best Thai resurant I have been to, try the Roaring Tiger and the eggplant with beef is amazing. Everything I have tried is great. I tried other Thai places but they do not compare!!!
