{"text":"Fantastic vegan food! Great customer service! Holly can veganize anything and make it delicious. I love her chocolate ganache tarts, smores pie, monkey bread, fudge, and basically everything else. Highly recommend her stand! She offers oil free, gluten free, and nut free scrumptious options! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Not only was the costumer service amazing, but the product was even better. The sweets are better than both vegan, and non-vegen products. I would definitely recommend Bite Vegan Bakery to everyone, and I plan on coming here more often."}
{"text":"Lemon blueberry bundt cake is one of the best I've ever had.  Moist and flavorful.  Certainly much better than the same from the \"other\" Bite Bakery.  THIS one is much better."}
{"text":"My favorite vegan treats in town! Every Saturday at Tivoil, it's a must. I need to start getting 2 of each cause they are to good to share"}
{"text":"Wow! Bite takes the cake. The best vegan baked goods ever! You would never know your eating baked goods without any dairy in it. Kudos to Holly for making delicious homemade treats that anyone could have, even her gluten free treats are amazing."}
{"text":"So, I was with my fiance visiting family in Vegas, and we had a mix of Vegan and non-Vegan people to feed. It can be difficult to find something that satisfies both but Bite def did the trick.   Personally, I thought the food was way better than many versions I've had with dairy/eggs, etc. Pretty shocking actually! Highly recommend the monkey bread and caramels.  The Vegan eaters in the group found a new favorite place and they go to the market to stock up on the Bite goodies on a weekly basis now."}
{"text":"Best chocolate cake I ever tasted. We love her baked goods. And the prices are good. Bite rocks."}
{"text":"A MAZ ING  Not sure what to say about this other than these desserts are one of the best vegan options in this city.  Sure you can find heavy sugary vegan cakes and cookies all over the place. (come on it's just minus the egg and dairy). But her items are yum yum yummy!"}
{"text":"This is probably the BEST vegan bakery in Vegas and definitely worth the wait for Saturdays in Tivoli! Make sure you get here early though, because a lot of stuff sells out FAST and no wonder..it's beyond good.  We go here almost every Saturday and have gotten a few different sweets from here but by far my favourite is the chocolate cake. Wow. So light and creamy, and very rich with chocolate and the icing is to die for. If you need a chocolate fix, look no further than this cake and if you need a sweet fix, look no further than this place.  Make sure you find yourself here sometime. Even if you aren't vegan, there is no way you wouldn't enjoy everything here. The people who work here are also pretty awesome and attentive and they give you a taste of anything you want. (: Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a pie shaped chocolate chip cookie (made with chickpeas) for my picky 2 year old. She barely let me have one bite but it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Best waffle I have ever had! Amazing other sweet treats as well. Also super sweet people. Two thumbs up for sure."}
{"text":"Great variety of vegan treats and every single one is delicious.  Best vegan baked goods I've ever had!"}
{"text":"It is so delicious and they both are so sweet. We had a gluten free waffle and it looked very good but then the taste is so mhhhh. If you like sweet stuff go there."}
{"text":"My first time trying Bite products, and may I say, the raspberry chocolate cake is luscious, fudgy (is that a word?) and simply decadent. Can't wait to come back next week and try something new."}
{"text":"Holly is so sweet just like her desserts. I've been coming to the market solely for Bite and Veg Out. Bite has a great selection of goods and many are gluten free. Total brownie points! I fell in love with the chocolate raspberry cake and I've been coming back for it. I had her waffles a few weeks back and it's still one of the lightest, fluffiest, tastiest waffle I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Celiac disease sufferers, BEWARE!!! These people cross contaminated a gluten free waffle my wife and I ordered.   We went to the farmers market at Tivoli Village on May 9th, 2015. We stumbled upon this stand and the menu looked interesting. I did not even think of this until after I began to feel sick, they were offering standard waffles and gluten free waffles yet only had 1 waffle maker???! Tell me, how do you avoid cross contamination when you're cooking both waffles in the same waffle maker!!!!! You can't call your gluten free waffles gluten free. It is now Tuesday the 12th of May and she is still not feeling well!   Lucky for us, we have a gluten intolerance. What if a person with celiac disease had eaten this, you would've killed them! You need to learn about cross contamination prior to selling any food products which makes me wonder if SNHD has ever visited you. Maybe it's time to give them a call."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! Finally, something vegan that's not trying to be healthy! Sometimes you just gotta indulge!"}
