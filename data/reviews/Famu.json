{"text":"The go-to place for high quality Australian/Japanese wagyu and Berkshire pork for shabu shabu. Price is high but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Beef products are consistently good. I've had trouble with the hand-packed Berkshire pork as I've never had a tray of the chops last for 3 days refrigerated before spoiling, but maybe that's just the nature of these heritage products.

In any case, this is my go-to when I'm hankering for wagyu!"}
{"text":"Love getting wagyu/grass fed from here with friends for our epic steak nights. 
The people who work there love meat and it shows."}
{"text":"Ah well an authentic Japanese butcher! They carry a whole range of Japanese cuts of meats and a lot of organic meats including organic burgers, sausages etc.
Some of the biggest selection of Wagyu I have seen in the city with best marbling I have witnessed compared to other stores that sell this stuff. In addition to Aussie and US Wagyu they sometimes even have Wagyu from Japan. Prices are in line with other places selling this quality of meat.
I would just like to frame the tray of Wagyu for shabu shabu in my place if I could.
Good service and one can place a bigger order which comes neatly packed Japanese style in individual wraps for each serving. 
Interestingly their Non Wagyu meats are quite good too and have higher than normal marbling one finds at other butchers. Some cooked items like Tataki, croquets are also available for purchase. One can spend a lot of money real fast here."}
{"text":"Fabulous meats!  They're the only Japanese butcher in Canada offering the widest selection of Wagyu and Kobe beef.  I am in beef heaven!  I purchased a Kobe striploin and an A5 Wagyu prime rib for a Valentine's Day dinner.  The prices are very reasonable and you're getting the Crème de la Crème of beef.  The staff are knowledgeable, attentive and patient while I was taking my time to decide on what cut to get. They are there to answer any questions you have while providing quality customer service.  I can't wait to try my buttery Wagyu steaks!"}
{"text":"Famu is a small store but packs a big punch.  All their meats are organic and of the best quality.  For a pork lover like myself, Famu helps you sleep with less guilt after eating 1kg of pork belly.  The service is cheery and it's worth to trip to J Town."}
{"text":"Not like any other meat shop, this place sells excellent authentic Wagyu beef and Berkshire pork!

Staff is great, they even give us some tips on preparing the Wagyu beef. This beef is one of a kind, and has a melt-in-your-mouth goodness!

We purchased Berkshire pork for porkchop, and these were delicious too!

Check out some items that they sell for 20% off as well: Beef tataki, berkshire pork hamburgers, etc.

Come here for best-tasting beef / pork! Definitely not your typical, and must be saved for special dinners at home."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Shiso Tree the other day, and figured that if I was in the area, I might as well stop by the market and see if there was anything interesting. Ended up walking past Famu's prepared foods section, and noticed that there was a tiny box of beef tataki for $3.80. I bought it. Inside, there were six thin slices of rare beef, served with a tangy soy sauce, more tangy than salty.

It was the best beef tataki I've ever had. It could have done with a touch more salt though. I was concerned that it might be chewy, because I've had a number of experiences where the cut of beef used for the tataki had tough connective tissue that made for some less-than-fun chewing, but this beef tataki was incredibly tender and if I see more of it next time, I will most definitely buy it again. Pretty sure it wasn't wagyu, because that special kind of marbling was absent, but it was delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is my first review, so please be delicate.

I am saving my 5 star ranking for the truly special places but I must say that this is one of my favourite places to buy meat. My love for this place started with a very nice piece of Australian Wagyu but has long since grown. At about 20 bucks for 100 grams of it, the indulgence might be difficult to justify (For those not wanting to do the math, that's about 45 bucks for a standard 8 ounce steak). That being said, highly recommended. 

If you are looking for more modest items, their Mennonite poultry or Berkshire Pork products are quite delicious and beat out the competition pretty hard. 

All in all, you have to appreciate a butcher serving such great product in an area that really does not have any great butcher shops. It should also be noted they recently started having legit Kobe beef, one of the only places I have ever seen with the certificate and all (not an easy feat by any means)."}
{"text":"We picked up Japanese Wagyu ($33/100g) for some good home style teppanaki.  :D  We used our electric griddle to cook the beef, seasoned with Fleur de Sel and freshly cracked pepper alongside slices of zucchin, shimeji mushrooms, onions and garlic.  We also prepared a Korean style Ssam (lettuce wrap) to enjoy with some steamed rice.

We thoroughly enjoyed the Wagyu experience and the electric griddle was great for a table top cooking for two.  :)  We also saw that Famu carries packaged Iberico slices which we'll pick up next time we're there.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have been ordering meats from Famu for at least 5, 6 years. Found in J-Town, it's a Japanese butcher (probably the only one found in the city); both owners are very familiar with meats and are always available to answer any questions that you might have. It's also extremely clean! 

You can find a number of meats in different forms; we always purchase ground chicken, pork, and beef as it's always fresh. I would also recommend their prepared stuff. I always have a pack of the premade hamburgers in the freezer as it comes in handy on the nights that you don't want to cook. Additionally, their take away lunch sets are pretty good as well. For a reasonable price,you can have a chicken katsu or curry rice meal. 

Good for: meats, premade meals"}
{"text":"My favourite place to buy meat!

Berkshire pork is to die for, I can't find any pork better than that here.
PEI ribeye is also my other favourite, price is very reasonable and tasty."}
{"text":"At Famu, aside from the excellent cut of beef, organic chicken, pork....

You will find marinated ready to cook food in the fridge...

And make sure you check out the freezer. you will find frozen foie gras from France and Quebec..

What's for dinner?"}
