{"text":"Decided to try this place because of the good Yelp reviews.  Was not disappointed.  Fabulous craft cocktails and amazing food.  Split the BBQ burger, fritters with cheese dip & Brussel sprouts with my husband.  The brussel sprouts could be a meal. Delicious!  The burger is ground sirloin and is perfection. We rarely eat burgers so when we do we want it to be worth it! The burgers here are well worth it!! We will definitely return for another burger, to try different menu items and different cocktails.  The menu isn't large but has great variety with something for everyone."}
{"text":"I was very excited to hear about a relaxed new bar coming to ayrsley but I was disappointed with what I found. The place has the potential to be a go to spot but have missed the mark. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is very relaxed and the music isn't blaring in your ear. The food is decent but nothing to write home about. The place has the feel of a craft cocktail style bar but the drinks are far from it. They have the liquors to produce good quality drinks but that's not going to happen with fake juices and a bartender that doesn't know what angostura bitters are."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a nice surprise as a result of a quick overnight stop in the area. One of the best burgers I've had in a long time, good waffle fries, and tasty (and interesting) pepper jack grit cakes.  Well-mixed drinks also. Will definitely add to my to do list when next in town."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Brussels sprouts!  Seared tuna salad was amazing as well.  Great drinks, food and fast friendly service.  Can't recommend enough"}
{"text":"Love the Corner Bar!  Its our new favorite place!  Alan is terrific and always treats us well! Food is good. Drinks are good! Atmosphere is terrific!  Especially love that they play all the movies on the TVs behind the bar in B/W.  Has a nostalgic feel.  It is a perfect location.  Stop by after work, the weekend, after you have hit the movies just next door.  Just a great local spot to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Stop in after catching a movie or anytime. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow! Where do I start? This bar is awesome. It's quaint and hidden outside of the uptown. The beers and drinks are great. The pumpkin beer with the cinnamon sugar rim is addicting. Ok and now for the most importantly shocking part. The food is grade A, top chef quality food. Not your typical wings and nachos. The steak is glazed in a coffee glaze that is sinful. The Brussels are perfectly cooked and apple with bacon omg genius. The burger with goat cheese and Noda BBQ sauce will have you craving this bar. Bar tenders are awesome, funny and let you pick a movie if you're nice. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Allen and Kami are AMAZING!!! So relaxed and the drinks are phenominal,  I appreciate getting to know my bartenders it's great to feel at HOME!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a great date night. Good atmosphere and drinks, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is the best bar in the area..hands down. They have the BEST food of any bar I've been to. I would not expect this kind of quality when it comes to bar food. The atmosphere is great and the service is excellent. I was hesitant to write this review because I wanted to keep this place a secret."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and management ! This place is one of the best places I've been to in this area! Great mule and beer selection. Our favorite foods : Brussels sprouts, crab bites and BBQ burger! Allen is an awesome manager, goes above and beyond, this place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by The Corner Bar to meet with a friend. Finding a good place to meet over drinks without raging loud music is challenging in the Arysley/SW CLT area.  The Corner Bar is a quaint little spot with character and friendly staff. For such a small place, the menu provides a good variety of drink choices and small (to medium) bites.   I had the crab fritters and a sampling of the brussel sprouts. The fritters were okay. They were a little too cakey for my taste. From many reviews, I expected more crab or at least most of a crab flavor. The brussel sprouts were better than the fritters and seem to be a favorite, as I noticed many orders leaving the kitchen. The bacon jam provides an interesting flavor.   I would visit again for the atmosphere. It is a great place for business meetings or just winding down after work. It's a great location with indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Loved the place! Went with my bestie and we WILL be back. The two plates we had and shared were So Good!! Nice staff, the place is just laid back and chill! Excited to go back with others. Perfect place to go before a movie on a date night or even better after so you are not in a rush!"}
{"text":"Our favorite local spot! Great bourbon selection! Love the apps and always spot on when suggesting beers too try too!"}
{"text":"First off I can't give any stars based off food bc I didn't order any. The menu is very VERY limited. Their drink \"specials\" not so great. My boyfriend got a version of a mule and he enjoyed it. I tried with a simple cosmo. Not to say I'm a professional drinker. But I have NO idea what they made it with. I drank it but it was weird. Asking for tequila shots ... after the 3rd try they finally had a tequila we asked for.   I'm going to say this place would be good for my regular vodka rocks straight up w lime. The place was small but cute. The workers were friendly. Can't complain there."}
{"text":"Such a cute place to relax and hang out wit you're friends. It was just a cool environment and their outdoor seating is nice. My sever was Kristin and she was amazing. She was so nice and easy to talk to. She really made my first experience there great! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Perfectly named spot!! The corner bar is a great little spot to grab a small bite and have a big cocktail before hanging out in the Arsley area.    Every bar tender knows how to put a solid drink together.  The Irish Donkey is hands down my favorite drink.  Pair it with either the waffle fries or the Brussel sprouts and you can't lose."}
{"text":"This place has not disappointed us YET! They have strong drinks and GREAT food. The pork belly sandwich is soooo good."}
{"text":"My favorite local bar! The food is great, the bartenders are phenomenal! Welcome home"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and hosted a work happy hour here so I feel like I can properly review.   I will say this, hosting an event here was amazing! The service was impeccable and the care they put into ensuring everything was great couldn't have been better. The food was really good. We had a cheese board (big hit), the fried chicken bites (my favorite), pork belly tacos (their pork belly was good), lettuce wraps, and the waffle fries. No one had anything bad to say about the food and pretty sure it was all gone in the end.   Drinks were a big hit with my Co-workers. A lot of it tends to be whiskey/bourbon based and they are into that. I'm not so much, but the bar is fully stocked and they will attempt to make whatever want!   The biggest thing for me that put them over the top to 5 stars was the service. As the organizer everything was made easy for me and that's super important. They rolled with a couple of quirks and never once lost their friendly vibe. The manager especially blew me away with his level of customer service and willingness to jump in and do EVERYTHING!! Highly recommend not only for an event but for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to go here for dinner on are stop over in Charlotte on are way to Surfside beach because of the reviews we read on yelp and we made the right choice it's a really small cool place we got there about 5:00 before it got crowded so we easily got a table because the place is small but that's part of the cool vibe you get from the place . We order the waffle fries, pepper jack fried grit cakes, and the sirloin kabobs all were delicious, I had a local IPA called Juicy J it was really good(actually had 2) service was very friendly and everything is reasonably priced. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good burger. GREAT mac n cheese. Very attentive service. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Simple menu with a few dishes that are done really well, I mean REALLY well! The cocktails are spendid, and the atmosphere is too notch. One of my favorite spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The BBQ burger was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile. The waffle fries were pretty good but I'll probably be going for the salad next time. The portion is pretty sizeable. It's a pretty spacious area with outdoor seating when it's warm. Nice place to stop in before or after a movie for dinner and a drink."}
{"text":"The burger sliders were amazing and the crab fritters were awesome. Very good service."}
{"text":"Yes! Finally a local neighborhood spot I can't find some higher end bourbons and feel at home. However...  I regret to say that I ordered most of the menu Togo to give a feel for the new neighborhood watering hole and felt it was more of a inconvenience to Oder Togo than dine in.   I ended up getting my food, shoved in a empty case of beer since the Togo containers were so small and they didn't have Togo bags.   The food was ok, most burnt and not having adequate sized Togo boxes i ended up getting every menu item deconstructed very annoying   I also regret to say that they don't have a cocktail menu. they also don't use fresh ingredients for juices so they have all preservatives in there cocktails. They have really made there image a dive bar instead of higher end for our neighborhood and the local hotel next door.   This place could be something great, but it's becoming a letdown   The lady waiting on me seemed nice. And slightly knowledgeable but needs more training.  The rest of the bartenders seemed nice but getting the vibe they need more training as well.   Also...  You don't leave vermouth sitting out in the well, it's refrigerated. And Walmart vermouth with $15 bourbon don't make nice manhattans."}
{"text":"Super low key and chill bar. Food was small plates but good portions and very tasty. Atmosphere was welcoming and charming, with great bar service. Good beer selection and bar tender will make whatever you want. Would be an ideal spot for a date night or also just to go hang and watch the classic movie selection."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, but never tried the BBQ hamburger. This burger is one of the best burgers that I've ever had! It really goes well with a Tito's and tonic!"}
{"text":"The fella and I walked over after some drinks at Carolina Beer Temple after seeing how great the Yelp reviews were. While it was pretty obvious where to enter, once we walked in, it wasn't clear how you were seated - no host stand, no sign telling you to seat yourself or wait - and there was a massive table full of people right inside the entrance. Awkward. We sat at the bar more to avoid confusion of asking where to sit. The bar itself went straight down without a cut in, so you couldn't put your legs underneath the counter, which meant you sat back pretty far - uncomfortable.  The bartender was nice, but there was no beer/wine/cocktail list. She read off the taps (which were right in front of us), told us we could see their liquor on the shelves, and said she could make any drink we wanted. The fella just went with a house white, and I got water.  For dinner, we got the Brussels sprouts, sirloin kebabs, and fried chicken bites. The sprouts were the highlight! They were tender with bacon a little tang from the brown sugar glaze. The sirloin kebabs were fine, but there wasn't much taste - you definitely needed the chimichurri sauce or ginger soy sauce to give them some oomph. Same with the fried chicken bites - the chicken was really tender but totally bland... thank goodness for the bacon jam!  Overall, if you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have only been here once with some friends, but it was fantastic! We did only stay for one drink (before going to a movie), so we didn't get a chance to try the food, but it looked amazing!! Prices are good, location is good, service is fantastic! What isn't to love? I will definitely come back, maybe for a date night!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Ayrsley!  Love the atmosphere, food and drinks.  The bartenders are awesome and will make whatever you want."}
{"text":"Interesting bar serving a limited menu which allows each item to be very tasty. Prices are reasonable and service was good.  Nice place to relax and unwind.  Places movies on the TVs vs regular programming and plays them deliberately in black and white which is an interesting choice.  Draft beer selection is limited but diverse. They have a good liquor selection which enables them to make a wide range of drinks.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Nice laid back atmosphere, great service, food and drinks. My wife and I enjoyed it and will visit again."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place because the husband heard about it and he decided to check it out.  If you know me, you gotta know I'm a sucker for a good sprout. Brussels, that is. I pretty much have to try them if I go to a place and they're on the menu. I saw some on the plate of another patron and it totally solidified my choice. Turns out, they caramelize them in this brown sugar glaze, put some bacon in there and the kicker is diced granny smith apples! I've never had sprouts with fruit in them, but it was an incredibly welcome surprise. The grit cakes were good, but I had to split the portion in half. After about 2 1/2, if you're the only one eating them, it's a LOT of grits. They toasted up great in the office toaster oven for breakfast, though! lol  The husband got the Corner Bar burger and it was solid, but my favorite part of his meal was the fries. I often frequent the Chick-Fil-A because they're one of the few places that can get a good waffle fry done, but these were just as good as those. And they have a bourbon honey mustard that will knock your socks all the way off.   I was very pleased with my drink selections. I got one of their specials with a tasty bourbon and the martini with espresso in it since I was sleepy. Hashtag old. The husband just got some Coppers and that was it.  So, overall: the bartenders were both very nice. As soon as we sat at the bar, we were promptly greeted. They offered suggestions when we told them we were first timers. We had some fun chitchat, which is always a good time if you're sitting at a bar. If you bring a pooch, you gotta keep them outside. The restrooms were clean and fully stocked. The sanitation score was up to par. The bartender that picked the movies while we were there has awesome taste (Ocean's Eleven in black and white). We had a great time and we'll definitely be returning! I wish Ayrsley was this cool when we lived closer to it."}
{"text":"We are in town for the weekend and saw reviews about this place and it was awesome!! We had the bacon wrapped shrimp and the Mac and cheese and waffle fries and it was all delicious and came out fast. The Mules were great and they had a great bourbon selection. We will come back next time we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is exactly the type of bar that Charlotte needs.   The Corner Bar is -- you guessed it -- in the corner unit with Title Boxing, adjacent to Ayrsley Grand Cinema. It's a small space, but the decor and layout keep it from feeling cramped. Two televisions above the bar play black and white movies; on my last visit they were screening White Heat. If there's a game on you absolutely must see, they'll switch it over for you, but the movies create a warm, nostalgic atmosphere that's tough to beat. The music is enjoyable, too; I heard some Beatles, Stones, and Zeppelin on my visit.  I've visited for dinner and was very pleased with my choices of Sirloin Kabobs and Caramelized Brussels Sprouts. The chimichurri sauce on the kabobs adds a delightful flavor, and the sirloin is cooked perfectly. The Brussels sprouts are easily the best I've had dining out; the bacon and granny smith apples make the dish shine. Portions are great for passing along your party, but one or two small plates make a decent meal if you, like me, aren't into sharing.  I can't speak for the drinks, as I just had club soda with lime, but I can say that the bartenders seem to operate exceptionally well together and enjoy their work. They call everyone by name and make sure that everyone is comfortable and ready to relax and have a nice night out.   All in all, The Corner Bar seems like a nice neighborhood hangout that's happy to welcome locals, travelers, and people looking to try something new."}
{"text":"This was my first time at The Corner Bar and I can't think of enough nice things to say about it.  The service was amazing, and both of our servers were on point.  They did not hover over us, and knew exactly when we needed something.  Their beverage menu was great, and we enjoyed specialty drinks as well as beer on tap.  The food was eclectic and savory.  We had a hard time deciding what to order.  It was absolutely delicious and the portion sizes were perfect.   Perfect if just wanting to get out with your significant other or a group of friends."}
{"text":"Down the street from the hotel I stay at in the area.  Always attentive friendly staff.  Great foot and reasonable drinks.  I always stop by every tine in the area"}
{"text":"Chill place to grab a beer. In town for work and enjoyed the atmosphere, bartenders, and the owner. They even have PBR on tap if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Corner Bar is a little Frou-Frou but their Mac and cheese and steak is awesome! Be sure to hit the Mac and cheese with some sriracha to really set it off!"}
{"text":"Fun and cozy little spot to stop and have some drinks and some delicious entree's. Friendly staff, and the lettuce wraps are AMAZING."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and a drink before catching a movie. The place is nice enough and the server was friendly, but the food wasn't good at all. I ordered the pork belly sliders and it was terrible. The pork belly was very chewy and leathery. I , literally, couldn't eat it...I couldn't chew it enough to even swallow it!  I told the server and he told the the owner/manager(?) and he came over as well. He told us that he wasn't surprised because he wasn't happy with the recipe either.  However, knowing that he was putting out a bad dish wasn't enough to realize that it would have been good business to offer me another menu item or not charge me for it. I had taken one bite of one slider and I attempted to cut (saw?) into the other. I didn't even eat the waffle fries because I was so turned off by the pork, but I was still charged full price. How can a restaurateur allow someone to walk out the door being completely dis-satisfied without trying to make it right? ESPECIALLY when they openly admit that it's not a good dish?!?  Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Fantastic yes-you-guessed-it Corner Bar located here in quaint Ayrsley! If you are tired of the Piedmont Social House scene like I am, definitely stop on over here for a unique experience. Honestly, I don't see how anyone can go wrong. Great drinks, great food. Dude.. Just make your way over here and stop playing corn hole or whatever that is called.   I actually really enjoy that they don't have a drink menu. It forces conversation with the extremely knowledgeable bartenders for one and two.. You may end up trying something you never knew you loved. (Perk for me, they now have Riesling here)   Despite not having a drink menu, they do have a small food menu. So far I have only had the Lettuce Wraps (which were actually really good) so I can't speak too extensively on the food but a fellow neighboring bar mate eased any apprehensions by letting me know that majority of the items are pretty good. After browsing some of the reviews, I think many would agree. Never had lettuce wraps that were beef but it was a really good!   Side note: you know that this place is golden when they have a \"regular\" who visits often and doesn't even live locally! Come sit at the bar and I am sure one other person sitting there too is a regular.   Pro Tip: Make sure you get Zane as your bartender."}
{"text":"The food was incredible along with the service! We had the chicken and grits, pork belly burger, and tuna sear salad. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, personable bartenders and a good cocktail selection. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We tried this place out right around closing time a couple of nights ago. The drinks were great, I had a really good cab. Then I red the food menu and was determined to come back.   So again friendly service and good drinks but the food is the focus of this review.  First, the Lettuce Wraps came out which included tender flavorful steak and delicious veggies. Yum, yum yum!  Then the Chicken and Grits came out. This is a favorite among the staff and I can totally see why. The salsa is awesome and perfectly sweet. The dish was well balanced with the sharp flavors of the Grits cakes. And the chicken was tender and properly charged.   We'll only be here for a week but I'm already planning a 3rd trip!  Thank you Alan and Cami for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"Such a great addition to this side of town. Skilled and knowledgeable bar staff. We had martinis on our first visit which were great. Food options are very good. We have sampled our way around the menu and haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the Corner Bar.  Our group went for Happy Hour on a Wednesday. First off Alan, the manager, was THE BEST....so welcoming, friendly, attentive (but not smothering) and mostly a really good sport as we all had questions and were looking for suggestions etc...  The staff was super and hard working. Never too busy to get you something you needed.  We loved the vibe and everyone there at the other tables seemed to be having fun. Good energy.  So many yummy plates of food going by and we all ordered something different and shared. LOVED the Brussels Sprouts. Mac & Cheese- YES! As for the drinks----lots of creative choices and all VERY GOOD. They actually put alcohol in them! Beer options were great too. Something for everyone.  We will come back for dinner soon as those steaks and burgers looked so tempting!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I had the chicken and grits and could not get over how delicious every bite was. The grits were especially interesting. Highly recommend it! My boyfriend and I shared the waffle fries and they were great. He had the seared ahi tuna salad, and thought it was perfectly cooked. Our drinks were very strong, which we consider to be a plus."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try The Corner Bar because the reviews are fantastic, the location is perfect and everyone seems to love what they ordered. I received great service, and the drinks were fine and it seemed like a date night destination with some more casual diners at the bar.   Unfortunately, we all left feeling a little \"meh\" about the food. We personally ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Bites,  side of waffle fries and Pork Belly sandwich and at the table was Fried Crab Fritters, Charcuterie Board, Seared Ahi Tuna Salad that we tried from our friends.  We had a good spread of different things on the menu.   My favorite thing was the Pork Belly Sandwich because I love my pork belly nice and fatty and juicy and tender which is what we received. But the majority said that it was TOO fatty (which may be absurd to me, but worth mentioning to you). My least favorite thing was the Fried Chicken Bites, just seemed a little over cooked to where the chicken was dry, we did not finish that entree and did not want to cause any trouble of sending it back.   Overall, everyone ate their food but no one was in love with it and my guests would probably not return. If we come back it will definitely to do drinks because the service was great."}
{"text":"Great new spot, food was on point and my favorite local IPA is on tap (hop drop). Top that off, great service from our waitress.  Will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Modern Rustic  Food: We ordered the BBQ Corner Bar Burger. Definitely not worth $13. You could tell the fries were freezer burnt although they were hot.   Service: ...still waiting...  Summary: Perhaps this modern, rustic Corner Bar appeals to the millennial minded people who want to feel upscale and overpay for their food and \"microbrews\" (PBR or Shock Top). Maybe it was a slow night (Saturday Night in May) but I wouldn't consider coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Hanging out with friends who recently moved to the area so decided to hang out with them in their neck of the woods. Or initial spot was booked for a corporate party and the bouncer recommended this spot and we had an awesome time.  Being a brown spirits lover, you can never go wrong with a good Old Fashioned. Prepared very well and the bartender definitely knew how to make it well.   Also decided to order the Sirloin Kabobs which I wish they came out with more qty wise because they were cooked extremely well. Literally ended up ordering another one and I was still hungry so ordered the Classic Burger. (I was being a  that night )  If you're in the Ballantyne area, definitely check out this spot. Very cool spot for a group and the GM was very helpful in finding something that was good for Vegans (lettuce wrap). Would be nice if they would incorporate more vegan/gluten friendly since my friend had a hard thing finding something.   Side note and nothing to do with the service/food just a weird conversation:  A friend ordered the Classic Burger & the GM named the types of cheeses they had in stock and stated Provolone is the closest to America Cheese? WTH? Never heard that before but anyway moving ijs."}
{"text":"What a fun little place. Came in to meet a friend for drinks with no intention on eating. I ordered a Moscow mule. It was great! My date ordered an old fashion that he enjoyed. The food menu has some very interesting things on it, so after reading it I was ready to try some! We started with \"The Return of the Mac\" it was delicious! I'm a huge fan of pepper jack and a lot of the entrees have pepper jack so I was happy! We then ordered the sirloin kabobs and the pepper jack grit cakes. Both were perfect! The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff are awesome about making sure you are taken care of. I like that they show black and white movies behind the bar. It felt less like a sports bar. With all that being said, you get what you pay for. I was happy as was my date. I can only speak for myself but I see a return in the near future."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place we've been to in ages! Get the Brussels sprouts...they are amazing!!!!! The steak cabobs were very tasty!  Alan the manager was so nice. ..talked to us at the table. .very welcoming. ..Nikki our server was spot on with her suggestions!  We loved loved loved it!"}
{"text":"Visited the Corner Bar on a stop over night in Charlotte on the way to the beach. Fun little place with a trendy vibe. Small menu, but carefully thought out and good for sharing over drinks. We had sirloin kabobs with an amazing chimichuri sauce, waffle fries, and pepper jack deep fried grit cakes. I am a girl who loves grits- they found a way to add pepper jack cheese to them and deep fry those suckers and serve them with some sort of delicious sauce I couldn't identify and I was in love!   Only downside was service was a bit slow because only the bartender was taking care of the whole place. They needed more help in there on a Friday at 5:30. She was friendly and worked hard, though."}
{"text":"What a great find. The Ayrsley area is so vanilla but this place has character! The staff are super friendly. The food is beyond standard bar food yet fits perfectly as bar food. My daughter said their burger is as good as (\"better\") than mine. Although slightly offended, I have to admit she's almost right. They were playing Wayne's World and a Harry Potter movie behind the bar tonight which is perfect. The old wood behind the bar and a perfect old fashioned make this place high on my list for when I'm in Charlotte. It's your neighborhood bar exactly as your mind sees it. My daughter, who \"doesn't like to eat at a bar\", was very impressed. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"My favorite I'm the Ayrsley area. The good food and beer selection combined with the relaxed atmosphere creates a win for everyone! The selection of local brews is great, the menu is good, the movies are a welcome relief from the norm of every day programming, and the bartenders are fabulous. Thanks for being here!!"}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte NC I was here for work and wanted a place to have a nice meal and a few beers after a long day. Nice atmosphere, friendly caring staff, excellent food and a few great local craft beers on tap. Get the kabobs get the kabobs and get more kabobs. I can not stress enough get the friggin kabobs. My only complaint is that the meal didn't include more kabobs."}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner here with the hubby and some friends. My husband and I shared the mac and cheese, brussel sprouts, steak skewers and chicken bites. Everything was delicious.... usually at tapas style restaurants I end up only really liking one or two items, but we thoroughly enjoyed every item here. My only complaint: The fancy drinks on the menu are a little pricey for the location not being in the city. I would be more inclined to try the Moscow mules or other bourbon drinks if they were closer to 7-8$ instead of 11-12$. Beers were normal price so we stuck with those."}
{"text":"Food was good and the bartenders were attentive without being too aggressive for a slower evening. I really enjoyed their crab fritters, the ratio of crab to fritter made it feel more like a crab cake. I'll probably go back just for those.   My boyfriend preferred the sliders and mac 'n' cheese, which I thought were just okay. The bartender also made him a delicious Moscow mule. They don't have a drink menu, but will make just about anything you ask for.   I'll likely go back soon and would've given 5 stars if \"one of the owners\" wasn't drinking and getting a little rowdy with some patrons at the end of the bar closest to us... Other than that group, it was a pretty chill little spot that I hope does well in this location!"}
{"text":"I Love Love Love this place this is my third time here. Alan is awesome always remembers what I want to drink. Craig the chefs always knows how I like my burger. Everything is always cooked to perfection, great service I will definitely be back. Finally moved to this side of town, so this will be my new neighborhood upscale bar and grill :)"}
