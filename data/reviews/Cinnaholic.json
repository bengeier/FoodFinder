{"text":"Let me start by saying, WOW!!   My first time there today and I really enjoyed myself, my fiancé told me about this place a couple days ago and decided to check it out.. And boy was I in for a treat this place was sooooooooo freaking good, the service was pretty amazing and the gentlemen who helped us was well spoken and knew everything and anything that we had questions about.. This place cured my sweet tooth big time, if your looking for something sweet try this place out..  Thank you for that amazing service and wonderful cinnamon roll..!!!"}
{"text":"I love cinnamon rolls!! Love them! This place is awesome! So many options! They offer two different sizes: regular & baby buns. The baby buns are like two bites, so I opted for the regular Size cinnamon roll with coffee frosting and chocolate chips while my gf had the baby bun with vanilla frosting topped with cookie dough. We also bought one of their cookies -- so soft ! Mhmmm. Warm and cinnamon goodness was the perfect dessert and I even had some for later!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but the rolls are way too sweet for me. I got a bun with cream cheese frosting, caramel sauce, pecans, and apples. The bun arrived warm and fresh. I saw them chop the apple in front of me, which was pretty cool. Anticipation turned to disappointment when I finally dug in. Not enough cinnamon, too much sugar. Like, I had to take two sips of water for every bite I took just to wash it down.   The concept is great - it's like the Coldstone of cinnamon buns. I also love that everything is vegan and fresh. They provided phone chargers at every table, which is a nice touch. It's a cute little place with retro decor.   It's worth checking out if you're a fan of super sweet things. Next time I would consider trying a bun without any frosting. I hope they add more cinnamon!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Cinnamon rolls + tons of icing flavors + lots off toppings = many options for yummy in the tummy. Decided to go with some of their daily specials and went with a pb&j crunch and coconut cream pie. Total came out to about $13 which is decent considering its gourmet and with all vegan ingredients. Cinnamon rolls where a good size with a generous amount of icing and toppings. Workers were nice and rolls were came out fairly quick."}
{"text":"Great place, a little pricy but at the same time you get a fatass customized cinnamon bun!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Friendly and informative service. Will definitely be back. The peanut butter, banana and chocolate was amazing!"}
{"text":"The Captain America roll was AMAZING!!  I had mine ubereats delivered and that's the way to go because our driver said the line was crazy long!  I also had the peanut butter roll and the old skool and they were also amazing!  My new favorite breakfast treat!"}
{"text":"I came here on the Fourth of July and it was horrible. No one was in there so I thought it would be quick. I went in and asked what was the most popular and the lady who \"helped\" us said, \"Whatever is in that case over there\", and walked to the back. Didn't say welcome, didn't say hi, she was rude. Someone else came in, I was ready to order, and then someone else walked in and she attended them first and had their cinnamon rolls ready within 3 minutes. My sister and I waited 18 minutes for a simple cinnamon roll with no toppings just the old school cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll itself was good, but the frosting tasted artificial. I've had vegan cinnamon rolls before so the fact that they are vegan doesn't mean they should taste like that. But will not be going here again."}
{"text":"Everytime I plan on cheating on my diet, I pull up at cinnaholic. The cookies and creme and smores (I call them type 2's) are instant faves.  I can see why this place was on shark tank. I dig this place!!!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Deliciousness. Full disclosure O had already decided this place wasn't going to be very good because how could vegan food be good? But boy was I wrong. If all vegan food is this tasty I'll gladly make the switch. But I can still have bacon right?  But for real try this place. Everyone says it's expensive but I thought for a gourmet cinnamon roll that is a treat it wasn't expensive at all. Perfection!"}
{"text":"If there was an option to give a billion stars, that's what this place would get.   I suffer with serious sweet tooth - I am a sugar fiend and being vegan there are limited options for convenient and amazing sweet treats in town.   Cue Cinnaholic. I'm there 2-3 times a week and I've introduced every single friend to this place. Even my non vegan friends say it's the best cinnamon roll they have ever had. (DUh!!)   My recommendation? Go for the regular cream cheese or the peanut butter frosting. If you're feeling really crazy, the pumpkin makes me want to die and float to heaven.   You can't beat this place. Give it a go! You are gonna for sure love it!   Ps. Marco and Aliscia (owners/managers) are amazing and I love them!  my favorite place in Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious cinnamon buns! I do wish they opened earlier, though. It's a vegan place (and I'm not vegan) but we still make the trip out because they're worth it. I do think they are better fresh in the store than reheated (I put one in the microwave and from now on I think I'd just eat it cold)."}
{"text":"I had a roll with almond frosting and chocolate chips... The cinnamon roll itself was delicious, it was super gooey inside and a great size, but the frosting tasted a little too artificial. I love almond flavor but that frosting needs a little work. My son had a roll with caramel frosting and it was delicious. We will go back."}
{"text":"How have I never even HEARD of this place. Its AMAZING!!!! AND they have a place in SD, my new s2yop everytimr I go back home. Only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because i clearly couldnt try everything in 1 sitting.   Great ingenuity. Madd props to the founder"}
{"text":"Hands down, he best cinnamon I have ever tried! Moist!!!! I'm in love!!! They even have silk soy milk for drinks. They make their own cookie dough that's so good also! I don't feel bad coming here for cheat day!"}
{"text":"Discovered that they had opened while I was on vacation. Bummed when I heard they were on the far west side of town, since I live in Henderson. But wait, they are just off the freeway entrance ramp I take after going to the salon every week. DOABLE!  Swung by today. Spent more time looking for the store in the giant shopping center than actually being in the store! Once I found it (hint - 3rd store to the left of Tropical Smoothie Cafe), I went in and ordered:  -caramel frosting w/chocolate drizzle  -butterscotch frosting w/apples.  Extremely nice young male counterperson started telling me all about the vegan-ness. I told him I was extremely familiar with the concept and didn't need to convince me to try it!  The frosting is more like a thin glaze, not a thick frosting for cakes. More gooeyness! I scarfed those puppies down like there's no tomorrow.  While I was there, several groups of people came in. He went thru his \"vegan spiel\" with each group. Only 2 of the 7 or 8 made a face and left. Several were incredulous that you can actually bake without eggs, milk or butter. One bite was all it took to convince them."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I ordered the cookies and cream cinnamon bun and it was out of this world. Not only were the treats delicious  but the service was outstanding. Marco took very good care of me and all my 6 other friends that came in. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice sweet, vegan treat!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but when we went there the taste was not what I was expecting. IT WAS SOOO SWEET. I can normally handle very sweet stuff but this was so sweet that I didn't want to eat it. It was nice though how you can pick all of the different flavors. The mini buns weren't as sweet however they weren't as soft as the bigger ones. Overall not a terrible place for dessert for someone who can handle something having a ton of sugar but not one I would go back to anytime soon."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! I've given this place 3 tries (2 at the other location and then this one today) My first visit I was really excited, and tried a popular favorite that had pecans and other stuff on, but definitely disappointed. The second time I returned earlier this year for another try at just the regular cinnamon roll, since we had received some of the mini ones at the office over Christmas and they were really good. That time was a total let down too, wasted calories and money, Cinnabon would've been better. Today I said I'll give them one more try, and I ordered the mini ones (because I liked those when received at my office) I ordered 2 with original frosting. I get to my car about to eat one and it's COLD! Cold frosting, cold roll. Who would ever want a cold cinnamon roll??? I called the establishment and they said they serve those rolls room temp. That would've been nice to know! I won't ever be back to this place and won't be surprised if they close soon- place was empty!"}
{"text":"So decadent and delicious! Friendly staff and so many choices of toppings. The coffee was was really good, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Cinaholic has now become our after school stop for an occasional sweet treat. The smaller version was more than enough for me, or splitting a large cinaholic bun."}
{"text":"The woman that helped me today was the worst. I first asked her for 30 mini rolls & to get the frosting & toppings on the side. She argued with me & said they don't like doing that even though I explained to her my friend got rolls from them before like that. So I then asked if I could get them all with different frosting & toppings & she said yes that's the chef's choice. I said ok pick whatever combination you want just make sure they are ALL different. I get the box & she did the same frosting & topping in sets of 4. I told her that wasn't what I asked for & how can we fix this & she said we can't fix it & I should have been more specific. I then explained that I thought by saying I want everyone one of them different that was specific enough. She then told me that I agreed to chef's choice & that's how she choose to do them because it is easier for her to make more of the same kind. A little side bar...the place was dead inside so it wasn't that she had so much to do. Needless to say, I will never buy from them again!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a cinnamon bun, fresh from the oven? This is on their wall and not just to be cute! We made our choices and waited for the buns in the oven. We tried butterscotch with cookie dough & brownie, cream cheese with pretzel & caramel sauce, hazelnut with caramel & pecan, and smores. Wow, they were all amazingly ooey- gooey and oh so tasty! There are so many combinations you could make with their frosting and toppings, giving all the more reason to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Nothing to rave home about. With a name like Cinnaholic, you'd think you'd taste the cinnamon in their old Skool roll."}
{"text":"It's soooooooo good, the pb with banana oh my god it's my favorite and the service is incredible. I'm a true CINNAHOLIC, couldn't be happier to have such a unique and tasty dessert place in town."}
{"text":"These rolls really are as good as everyone says.  SERIOUSLY yummy and addicting.  And so many different combos of icing and toppings... I can't wait to try a bunch more!  The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the service.  I've been twice and had two different employees .... and both were not exactly what I'd call \"friendly.\"  All-business and barely a smile.  That's fine, I guess... but it's not gonna get you 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious. I was worried it may be undercooked inside like Cinnabon... but this is perfect!"}
{"text":"These are just amazing cinnamon rolls! They have so many options to customize your order and they're all delicious! Once you have a Cinnaholic roll, you won't be able to enjoy any other kind. They're just so fresh and clean tasting and delicious! And the staff are great!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS!! My first time here, and I'm fully addicted!! These rolls are amazing!! And the different flavored frostings are to die for!! You can't go wrong with these sinfully sweet (TOTALLY VEGAN!!!!) treats!!  I can't wait to come back and I haven't even left yet!!"}
{"text":"Omg! That's about all I can say. Seriously OMG these cinnamon rolls are Good!!!!!!so many choices. The store is super clean but OMG they are so good."}
{"text":"I literally love this place, sounds terrible after I've had a good work out and I'm just having a sweet tooth which is rare this definitely a spot id chose it's a  wonderful place :)!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Allergy Girl's first cinnamon bun!  Buns are dairy and egg free and they keep nuts separate.  No allergic reaction, pure enjoyment."}
{"text":"This little shop is not too far from my work and we were just checking out some new spots in the area and since me and my coworkers are crazy about sweet treats we decided to stop by. I ordered the peanut butter, chocolate and banana cinnamon roll and I loved it! The roll itself was very fresh and was just sweet enough without being too sugary. The toppings were really gooey and sticky and delicious, u definitely need a fork to dig in! I love little shops like this cause everything is made with thought and care and it shows in the quality. We will be back for suuuuuure!"}
{"text":"Yummy we loved it!!! What a wonderful Mother's Day treat!!! My whole family enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a banana peanut butter with chocolate sauce cinnamon roll and it was delicious! We'll be back to try other flavors"}
{"text":"I happened to pass by this place and wanted to give it a try. I ordered coconut cream rolls and it was fantastic fresh and delicious!!! I will go back for a different one for sure! I"}
{"text":"I love cinnamon rolls. I never make it to the mall for the famous rolls. I was driving by on my way to my local target and decided to stop here to try. I often see the place but never stop. I go in and was a little overwhelmed by all the different options. I called my family and asked them to choose and I chose the cream cheese with strawberries on top. It was so good and we passed around all the other ones we ordered to try each other's. they were all great. I loved my husbands the most he had a caramel sauce mixed with frosting. All in all it was great. I'm would definitely go back whenever I am in the area. The price point wasn't bad either about $4 and change. They also have mini ones for the little ones or when you don't want to feel as guilty."}
{"text":"First time visiting and it is exactly what the reviews rave about! The absolute best cinnamon roll I've had. I customized mine with cream cheese frosting, caramel sauce, bananas and graham crackers! Gotta try it. I think they should add this combo to the list fasure lol. The owner Marco was super friendly and it was a joy visiting cinnaholic!!"}
{"text":"The best cinnamon roll I've ever eaten !!!  It literally melted in my mouth !  Love and will def be back !  Congrats to the owner !"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good spot to go to when I'm feeling that once and a while craving for cinnamon rolls without having to drive and hunt down a Cinnabon. I happened to get an email from Yelp about this 'hot and new' spot to check out. Sooo...I happened to be in the area and decided to check it out. Was a little nervous about the fact that all the items are Vegan, never has anything Vegan, but thought I'd still give it a shot. Walk in to some pretty sour faces. Two individuals who made it seem like a chore to even say hello or give a proper greeting. Ask a couple of questions about their menu as it's my first time there and I'm trying to decide what to get. Cold and blank wall responses is what I got. Whatever, I decided to just order a regular cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting, going with the classic to be safe. Did get a scoop of cookie dough to try. Roll was warm, which I was worried about after reading some of the reviews on here. First bite was okay but seconds after, I was hit with the most awful after taste. I couldn't take another bite let alone stand the smell even. Made me nauseous! Cold staff + interesting food (to say the least) = SKIP for me!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from the Berkeley location for a few years now. I'm so excited you guys decided to branch out and come to Vegas! They were always good when I would get them in the mail but to be able to have a fresh warm VEGAN Cinnabun is a real treat."}
{"text":"So yummy! So many different ways to make a cinnamon roll....oh and the homemade cookie dough amazing!"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon to try them out. We didn't know what to order. The employees were super nice and even gave us a couple of extra treats to try out. The cinnamon rolls were great. Nice selection of fresh things to put on top. The best part- We didn't feel all heavy and stuffed after only eating half. We will be back."}
{"text":"Heard of Cinnaholic from someone's Twitter and checked to see if there was one in Vegas and happy to say there is! Came with my friends and immediately fell in love with the cinnamon smell! We went in around 815/830 PM and it wasn't too busy but there were a couple of people before us. The wait wasn't long though, and the cinnamon buns were ready within a couple of minutes. We tried several flavors and each one was sweet perfection! You can choose your own frosting for $0.25 and toppings for $0.45. Each bun before toppings/frosting are $4.75. The cinnamon buns were nice and warm and all of them were delicious! Definitely a new favorite place."}
{"text":"The best cinnamon roll I have ever had hands down. Nice size, had enough toppings, & the service was quick."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place so I could review it on my website - I was NOT disappointed! Super friendly young man at the counter who had no problem explaining to me how the process worked. He waited patiently for us to decide on what we wanted to order; my fiancé got the Cookie Monster & I got the Spice 4 Fall with walnuts instead of pecans (don't judge me!). Like, whoever thinks vegan food isn't good needs to get a reality check and come to this place!"}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite thing in Vegas! Everything from the cinnamon rolls, amazing staff, and beautiful indoor atmosphere, got me hooked on Cinnaholic. I've pretty much had every flavor - yes, I'm THAT obsessed - and I loved them all. I'm also very impressed the ingredients are free of some common allergens (dairy and eggs) and vegan. They are also a healthier option compared to other dessert places. If you are looking for a place to get dessert, go here!!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on Shark Tank and I wanted to try it.  I'm not even into cinnamon buns but I decided to give it try. It was AMAZING!!! I Had the cake batter frosting with the cookie dough topping. I can honestly say it is in the top 5 best deserts I've ever had in my life.  It's definitely a once a year on my birthday kind of treat for me.  It's soooo good it's dangerous!!!"}
{"text":"Two stars because they are SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!! 15min to get a cinnamon roll......NO BUENO"}
{"text":"So excited that there is now a location near my house ! I love how you can create your own cinnamon bun with whatever roll, frosting and toppings !!! I haven't tried many yet but I will be back for sure for some more . Really like that it's vegan and you can't even tell the difference. They are yummy ! Staff is nice and they are all smiling and happy to be there . Make sure you sign up for the rewards also :) super easy to sign up"}
{"text":"I thought it was great. Got a classic...because you can't go wrong with that! Also got a cream cheese with strawberries. The others looked amazing but they are so sweet I didn't want to have all sweet stuff on it. Made fresh! I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Cannot stop returning here. I can't believe these are vegan. Thanks for opening on this side of Las Vegas in Henderson NV. Love the Birthday Cake Roll!!!"}
{"text":"So good! Went here quite a while back but forgot to write a review. If I remember correctly I ordered a coffee-cake cinnamon roll and my girlfriend got a custom one with pecans, I think? Both of us were so satisfied with our decisions. Next time I'll probably get a baby bun because the regular size was almost too big to eat without falling into a sugar coma-not that that's a terrible thing. ;) There are SO many options and combos that it makes it difficult to settle on one, but that's why you gotta make plans to come again.  Customer service was awesome and the music playing inside was great!   We are thinking about getting one of the \"cakes\" for a family member or two for their birthdays later this year! Will be back when we are on that side of town again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best cinnamon rolls in town! I prefer the old school roll but sometimes you just need to treat yourself to some crazy toppings. It's good to have all of the different choices. Overall a great friendly staff and a killer cinnamon roll!"}
{"text":"Well like everyone said they are amazing !!! Only complaint I have and cost the fifth star... They should be warmed a little bit!!!"}
{"text":"This place is TERRIFIC! Most delicious cinnamon roll I have ever had, and the presentation and costumer service was incredible!"}
{"text":"Today I had the coffee and pecan cinnamon roll it was great best place for rolls great service good find"}
{"text":"My kids were dying to go here and finally went the other day. The cinnamon rolls they ordered were amazingly good. There were some that had bananas and coconut on top and others with strawberries and banana. Delicious!!!! But the customer service is really outstanding. My son actually left his wallet there and I went back to look for it and had no luck. I asked the assistant manager to ask the manager (who was off) to review the security camera to see if someone picked it up. They did that and didn't see anything. Later that night however, my son got a call  letting him know that they found the wallet while they were cleaning up. When he went to pick it up all the cash and gift cards were still there! That really speaks to the honesty and trustworthiness of the employees. Even though there is a lot of construction going on around them, people should really check out Cinnaholic. Delicious treats, cute interior and honest, hard-working employees!"}
{"text":"I guess there's another chain cinnamon roll place in town to compete with Cinnabon. Well, it doesn't even come close to Cinnabon's rolls, which I still love but hardly ever get. I don't like the idea of putting all these weird toppings and flavors on cinnamon rolls. You might as well call it something else. It just ruins what they are and this seems to be a trend with other desserts, such as donuts. So, of course, I ordered the traditional roll. It was dry and didn't have good flavor. The cream cheese frosting was runny and a bit too rich because I could taste the butter. They needed to balance that out. They definitely can't compete with Cinnabon rolls, whose frosting was never runny."}
{"text":"The best of the best vegan cinnamon rolls! They don't taste vegan so it's perfect for everyone. This place never disappoints me. The rolls are very sweet so if you get sweet toppings (Oreo bites/cookie dough) it might be a little much FYI. I would recommend the cream cheese frosting with strawberries. YUMMY"}
{"text":"Are you vegan!? Then welcome to heaven! Not Vegan? Then get ready to pay airport prices for a sugar coma. This place is really only worth it if you're Vegan.  The classic roll is absolutely delicious by itself and doesn't need extra toppings. The starting price of $4.75 is extremely high in my opinion. I added fresh strawberries to my order this time and they put about 4 pieces of chopped strawberry ??? So for an extra .75 cents I didn't even receive the equivalent of (1) whole strawberry -_-  I'm not vegan, so I don't feel the need to waste my money on the simple novelty of being able to eat an all plant based dessert."}
{"text":"Goodness gracious this place is delicious! And vegan to boot. I usually get a cinnamon roll with cream cheese icing and topped with blackberries. From there I'm transported directly to heaven  I would love to see calorie counts and have a larger variety of beverages. And I wish they opened way earlier since I always think of cinnamon rolls as a breakfast food and I'd rather go in at 7 or 8am."}
{"text":"I was at Walmart and I decided to check this place out on a whim. WOW. I've never had a better cinnamon roll in my entire life! This place is fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw this place located next to one of my favorite Starbucks. What an adorable idea! The store was clean and open. Unfortunately, that's the last positive thing I can say. The staff were not friendly. The roles themselves tasted bland and barely cooked. The almost \"foamy\" frosting was grainy and sugary. Like the sugar didn't have a chance to dissolve. Between my daughter, her friend and myself we tried three different roles. They were so sugary sweet that they were impossible to even think about finishing. I don't mind paying for quality and ingenuity, but I felt like I literally threw my money away at this place as all three roles went in the trash. Too bad."}
{"text":"This place is freakin' amazing. Are you vegan? Go here. Are you not vegan? Go here. Are you reading this right now? Go here. Seriously give this place a try; it'll change your mind on plant-based food. I mean, cinnamon rolls and cookie dough??? I can't think of a better combo.   I even brought one home to my dad and he confided in me that it was delicious- then I hit him with the reality that it's vegan. Boom. The look on his face was priceless.  He was impressed...you will be too!"}
{"text":"I'm glad this place exists. Mainly because it's vegan. But I do have mixed feelings about it.  The cinnamon rolls are good. But you won't enjoy them if you don't have a pretty big sweet tooth. I'm not much of a fan of sweets but I can easily appreciate a cinnamon roll every so often. These rolls are just sooooo sweet. Almost too sweet. It's the icing that really does it for me so I try to remember to ask for them to go light on the icing because if not it tastes like I'm just eating globs of icing. I can never get more than halfway through one of these until I'm not able to eat anymore. In my opinion they're a bit pricey. I got a cinnamon roll and a tiny little carton of almond milk for almost $10.00.  I know they have a rewards/points program and they never reminded me my last visit so I totally missed out on getting my points for that visit. I don't come here often so it would have been nice for them to remind me (anyone) that they have a points system.  There are a lot of seats for you to chose from and most of them, if not all of them have outlets next to them for you to charge your phone.   Overall this is a nice little place to stop for dessert but definitely not somewhere I see myself more than like once every couple months."}
{"text":"Bomb.com!!!  I get the OG cinnamon roll with no added toppings or i'd have a sugar aneurism. It's sooo good! It comes warm and gooey with sooo much flavor. Unfortunately it's near my job so i'm here way too often. It's slightly under 5 bucks for one but treat yo self! Also-- everything is vegan? I never would have guessed."}
{"text":"This place was excellent and you guys provided such pristine customer service, I was very impressed. I was also pretty impressed with the cake itself and how moist and also cakey it was. 10/10"}
{"text":"I got the a roll with chai frosting. The frosting was ok. The roll was flavorless. It needs salt, but it also needs something else. Love? The texture was nice, but if they are exclusively going to do cinnamon rolls, the base product needs to actually be good. If you want to go out of your way for a good cinnamon roll, go to Cafe Breizh."}
{"text":"I was among the people who stood outside of the Centennial store when they offered free Cinnamon rolls. I thought it kind of silly to wait so long instead of just buying one at another time, but my companions thought it would be fun. We waited in line for two hours - making the best of it by getting to know others in the line. We inched up a little at a time. I was wondering if anyone would come out and communicate with us to let us know our status and if we should keep waiting, but nothing. At about 12:45 a.m. we got almost up to the building and they turned off the open sign and said they were out of cinnamon rolls. Needless to say, we were very disturbed by this realization - especially since they haven't said anything. We entered the store and they pretended not to see us. I thought for sure they would thank us for coming and maybe give us a voucher for a cinnamon roll at another time. After all, that would just be good business. An angry group just stood there in shock. A guy gave some people some cookies after they complained, but not everyone got one. I am so disappointed! Not because I didn't get a cinnamon roll, but because I felt we were treated badly. I don't see myself going there anymore. Too bad. Oh, and by the way, one of the people in line said that they guy didn't care if we gave a negative Yelp review. Nice."}
{"text":"Warning: May be habit forming and extremely dangerous for your waistline. We've all been there growing up; strolling through the mall when the smell of a warm fluffy Cinnabon hits your nostrils and guides you right to the glass display of cinnamon roll heaven (yes, that's a thing).   Now imagine that but 100% plant-based and cruelty-free, it doesn't get much better than that... oh wait actually it does. How you ask? Well my furry friend let me tell you, the taste is even BETTER than a Cinnabon.   PROS  + insanely delicious, my classic cinnamon roll was fresh out of the oven so the vanilla cream was slowly melting and oozing down the sides   + friendly service, quick to take my order, briefed me on some yummy options and explained how things worked  + it was pretty busy and I didn't wait too long which is always a good sign  + located in the heart of Green Valley  CONS  - didn't have any gluten-free options   - I waited about 10 minutes for my roll; however, I didn't mind because they made it fresh for me  - just because it's plant-based doesn't mean it's calorie-free (wahhh)  If you haven't tried this place, you're seriously missing out on one of theeee best dessert places in Henderson."}
{"text":"Yummy cinnamon rolls and they're vegan?!? What?!? I've been wanting to try this place for quite awhile now. But once the fams found out they were vegan, they quickly suggested something else. So sadly, I didn't get to try this place out til recently. But ohhhh am I...no wait...WE are so glad that we finally did. I just wished we came here sooner.  The menu is pretty simple for the cinnamon rolls. You pretty much choose your frosting and toppings and that's it. They do charge for each topping so try not to go overboard with your choices ;)  Now, if you can't figure out how you want your bun, then they do have some popular combinations that you can go with.  Or you can do what we did, and ask the gentleman what he recommends.    The cinnamon rolls are of good size, soft and gooey.  I love how their frostings are not overly sweet and the flavors are not overbearing.  I personally love whipped frosting and their frostings are so much better!  They're light and airy and not heavy whatsoever.    This is definitely a great place to go to help cure your sweet tooth or as a dessert option after dinner.  The rolls are not too heavy and you can easily share one between two people (or get one each, noone's watching lol).  The price is a bit more on the higher end, but then again, they are gourmet cinnamon rolls and VEGAN!  And if you're not vegan, no worries!  They're still oh so delicious.  The husband, who is a cinnabon fanatic and not vegan, loves it and can't wait to get more!"}
{"text":"The absolte worst part of this place is that it's too close to my house to resist!!    I have gone a couple times now and am pretty boring, so I get the baby buns with cream cheese frosting...  There is NOTHING boring about these!  The taste is incredible, the consistency is perfect for a cinnamon roll.  My husband got a full size roll with chocolate, caramel and graham crackers. He fell in love!   I can't wait to get more brave and try more flavors!"}
{"text":"Talk about joy in your mouth :) This place takes cinnamon rolls to a whole new level. And it's all vegan..... The customer service was great and I got my food so quick. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I wish this place wasn't so far from where I live. This was the best cinnamon roll I've ever had! Such a cute little place"}
{"text":"This is soooooo delicious it is allot better then the other cinnamon bun place you really taste the cinnamon and not so sugary fabulous place go check it out only been open two months."}
{"text":"We love going here, especially after the gym. The selections are wide and each one we've tried are delicious and filling. May seem a bit pricey, but don't let that scare you, the servings are large and worth every penny. The staff is friendly and do a good job of doing their jobs. They seem happy to be there, like we customers."}
{"text":"The only real problem with this new little slice of heaven is that it's way too close to my house and I want to come here for like every meal every day! (Good for my taste buds, not so much for my waistline, so I do not let myself go daily, but do enjoy treating myself to it often!) I'm not even on a vegan diet, I just love the quality of flavors and ingredients. I have been in when it's been busy and slow and got the same level of service each time, they're always polite and as quick as they can be.  The different combinations of flavors are awesome, and I am a sucker for their caramel frosting- OMG. Pictured here is their blueberry pie cinnamon roll, and then one I built with caramel frosting, bananas, and pecans. So good, any time of day!  The one thing I wish they had would be some sort of gluten free option- I know it's hard to make too much gluten free but to have maybe one type of roll/frosting GF would be a huge bonus. Other than that, no complaints! Yum yum."}
{"text":"To be completely real this place was pretty bad. The cinnamon roll itself tasted like it was made with Bisquick (however you spell it), the frosting was no bueno, and the strawberries were, well strawberries. The flavor was sadly  underwhelming.  They were definitely not soft and delicious despite looking like they would be amazeballs. This may be an unpopular opinion but I'd rather go to Cinnabon. I wish that was still one around in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious cinnamon rolls fresh out the oven, with your favorite, flavor-infused toppings! We had the Bananas Foster and it was sooooo yummy."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious and amazing. I try not to stop by here everyday. But I definitely get one for breakfast once/week. So many choices and options. If I'm running late to work, I make sure I bring my first client of the day one as a gift. Lol."}
{"text":"I went here this evening and the one girl up front rocked it out of the water.  Super nice attitude, great knowledge of everything, let us sample the cookie dough, and also SHE KNEW WHAT APPLE PAY WAS.  I'm impressed because no one else did.  I added a star because of her:-)    Cinnaholic has only 1 saving grace.  Bomb food.  The employees are meh, the dining area is winchels-ish, and the knowledge of the register is sub par.    I get the old school and it is of course amazing.  I recommend it to anyone.  The 3 stars is because of the experience and the decor."}
{"text":"Very very delicious! The fact that it's vegan is what brought me here and I was not disappointed! If you are craving a delicious vegan treat-this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Adrianna and I am a Cinnaholic!  Amen! This place has my heart! So so good !  What a great idea , frosting and toppings on a fresh just out of the oven humongous cinnamon roll! Marry me ! Since it was my first time , it was complete sensory overload so the friendly help from the cinnamon angel behind the counter was welcomed and much appreciated .  They took their time with my indecisiveness and I ended up ordering off recommendation! I trusted the expert and it paid off !  I ordered one cinnamon roll with amaretto frosting, chocolate sauce and fresh raspberries , HOLY HELL! It was so flippin delicious , not too sweet as I was afraid, but just right with the sweet and sour raspberries !  The fresh fruit added just the right amount of fresh flavor and balanced out the sweet frosting and rich chocolate .  Perfection !  I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I want to eat here every day for the rest of my life. Waited in life for about an hour but it was definitely worth it. This place is inexpensive and a 10/10 EVERYTIME"}
{"text":"Cinnaholic isn't always five star in my book but I seriously love this one MORE than the one in Berkley. We have been to the flagship about five times so I'm familiar with these buns.   Vegas location is great!!!!!! It's super cheery inside and setup a tiny bit different and great.  Walk in, order straight in front of you, and move down the line to pick it up. They have a flat screen on the back wall playing cute music videos that were upbeat. Loves.   You pick your bun, like mini buns or original then pick your frosting (alllllll kinds of flavors) and then pick your toppings! Not sure on prices. (Two dressed huge buns and a huge brownie came to $16.)  My fav is the Smores and the homemade brownies. Or a flavor icing and brownies on top. I was SUPER tempted to get the spiced icing with the fresh peach........but I'll have to try that next time.  When I want cheat time I want cookie dough, brownies, and allllllll the chocolate possible lol.  Anyway I suggest cake batter icing with cookie dough and my usual of chocolate icing with brownie pieces.  They hold up for a ride home, even on a hot day today the eco boxes and paper sack protected them until we got home.  I think they have bottle water and coffee but that's not important.  !!!!!!!!!!!!Just give me some buns hun!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Buns on buns on buns. Two words: custom. cinnabuns.  Admittedly this place isn't home to the most mouth-watering cinnabuns I've had, but being able to make your own cinnabun is pretty cool.   The service is pretty good and being open until 10PM definitely doesn't hurt.  I recommend the baby buns because what girl isn't into a pair of cute lil' buns."}
{"text":"Can't get a small size solo, have to buy a full size role which is way too big. The frosting is pure sugar - waaay to sweet and the roll was a total disappointment. Cinnabon is way better."}
{"text":"Smell nice when you walk in the door. So vegan or not.. no health benefits here hahaha. Went for this treat after dinner and was not disappoint. Pure crack though. So much sugar. Went with a Cin-a-cannoli or something like that. Was insane.. they did a pretty good job with the frosting and toppings. You can also build your own I think. These are easily shareable though and I wouldn't recommend going at it on your own for health's sake. Best enjoyed warm while you hang out."}
{"text":"I thought this was pretty good. I like the idea of different types of toppings for your cinnamon rolls. They are a slight bit heavy handed on the sugar but what the hey. I'm willing to give them another go. I enjoyed my cinnamon roll and would like to try another"}
{"text":"Yum! Went to Cinnaholic for the first time and it was really good! I order the Captain America and paid $7, which was a little pricey for just a cinnamon roll with fruit. There was open seating inside and wasn't crowded at all!"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem of Las Vegas valley. Both the s'mores and the original flavors do not disappoint, and it's sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. The rolls are soft and gooey, and they scoop tons of frosting right on top of the warm roll. Five stars for sure, and I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazingly good cinnamon rolls. Soft, warm and sweet. However, for my first time visiting the place the guy behind the counter wasn't much help."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a person who goes out of my way for cinnamon rolls but we had seen Cinnaholic on Shark Tank so my husband and I had to try it. The portions are ginormous and you can customize your cinnamon role countless different ways."}
{"text":"Really yummy, not too sweet. Fun options to make it your own. I dug it.  They have coffee and some drinks in a fridge for drink options."}
{"text":"A Vegan Cinnamon Roll Bakery - so crazy! Walking in, the place has a good atmosphere with music, Halloween decor and a great seating area. The menu was easy to read it, the hardest part was deciding on what frosting and topping I wanted!   I was highly disappointed in our female cashier, tall brunette with her hair in a bun. She seemed very moody especially after my friend showed her the Groupon she bought the other day (one of the reasons we came here in the first place - she wanted a good deal and I'm vegan) She wasn't helpful at all she just recommended I add coconut after I decided on blueberry and was in such a hurry even though we were the only customers inside. She NEVER asked us if we were dining in or taking it to go she just marked it as to go.  The two gentlemen working were so nice especially the handsome guy with the glasses and Star Wars shirt  who might be the franchise owner because his customer service was on f'n point! The girl cashier walked away after my friend was done ordering and I actually wanted to buy one to go for my roommate but she wasn't texting me back but luckily the guy came over and I told him that she just said pumpkin spice and he then recommended 5 different toppings explaining why they balance well! I went with pie crumble and he even signed me up for the rewards program and explained how it worked!!   The other gentleman accidentally put on pecans instead of pie crumble by mistake and instead of just giving it to me they both asked if it was ok (never know if someone as nut allergies!!) and I explained it wasn't for me, that's why I picked pie crumble and they made a fresh one all over again, which is better than picking them all off lol  My blueberry with coconut roll was delicious! The coconut didn't balance as well as I thought it would but it still worked. My friend ordered a maple with graham crackers. She wished it was less chunks of crackers and more of a crumble. And we both enjoyed the chocolate chip cookie! But it's super disappointing they didn't have any brownies ready for us to try!   Overall I will totally be back! Would have gave them 5 stars had the female cashier been more friendly and outgoing. Especially over a Groupon...don't put out a Groupon if you don't want new customers, it's not just for cheap people it's to help people discover you!!! But maybe next time they'll earn it"}
{"text":"Seriously love this place!! Best cinnamon rolls ever! I can't believe how many options there are here! Love love love this location and it's super nice and the staff is always so friendly ! Definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Uuuuuuuhhhhhhhhh......speechless! I've been trying to make my way into Cinnaholic for FOREVER! I'm not vegan guys, let's just get that straight, but cinnamon rolls are very important to my cravings :) and this place is closer to me than any Cinnabon location.   After LVAC I went straight to Cinnaholic (then went to get BBQ). It was some time after 2pm and we were the only ones in there, I was kind of expecting it to be crowded, maybe we just got lucky. The young employee was very helpful and she was nice. Gotta love great customer service right!   I ordered the Old School, which is a classic cinnamon roll. It was my first time there, I had to to find out how the Classic stacked up. It was SOO good!! I inhaled it. I have to say...I really don't like the cardboard container they put it in...it's too hard to lick the frosting out of it.   We also ordered a Carmel Apple, which tasted like those Carmel apple lollipops, yum! And we had the special of the day which was Sucker for Smuckers...I think, it was peanut butter with grape drizzle and gram crackers. I can't remember exactly what was in it, but it was really good!!   We bought a brownie too but, I'm saving that for tomorrow...I have a feeling I'll be very pleased :)"}
{"text":"DeLish!!! I keep it simple....cream cheese frosting with pecans anD  it is...YummmOhhhh  I love that they are open late"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to take my none vegan friends. Sometimes I don't even tell them it's vegan! They have every topping imaginable. This was my first time to this location and they had fresh cinnamon rolls baked every 15 min. We got the banana cream pie with berries and Also got the pb&j cookie doe. I got my sister the birthday cake one. When I go I always ask for light frosting because sometimes it can be too much. Would def recommend to all! My favorite part...animal cruelty free!"}
{"text":"Really cool place. I'm sure their business will be successful. There were a few things though that made me consider not going back again. I got a cinnamon roll with raspberry icing. The actual cinnamon roll was very good in my opinion. Not a huge fan of that particular icing though. The whole cinnamon roll was too overpowering and sugary. Definitely check it out but get the basic cinnamon roll or basic cookie dough. The added toppings overall just makes it not great."}
{"text":"As always, these cinnamon rolls are so gooddddd, never let me down and always have something new to try and enjoy! This is Cinnaholic's newest location here in town and everything was perfect, clean, friendly and comfortable!  I will always be a customer and HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Bring your friends, enjoy and hey they're vegan!! Double win!  I got the captain America(Highly Recommend) and my Bf got a regular one!"}
{"text":"We visited this eatery for the first time yesterday. The staff especially the girl at the counter was super nice and helped us with our selections. The Cinnamon buns were phenomenon and tasted delicious.   We were very disappointed with the utensils especially the plastic forks available at the restaurant. I honestly had difficulty using the fork as it was so cheap that it kept on bending/breaking and we were not able to use it.   We brought up this issue to the staff and they agreed with us. The staff informed us that the issue has been brought up to the manger, Alicia? or Allison? several times and nothing has been done about it and many other customers have also complaint.  One of the female staff was so nice that she offered us to go next door at Rubios and get us better forks so we can enjoy our food.  We will most likely would not return to this location unless we decide to take our own utensils."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this, who doesn't like cinnamon rolls.  I only tried the mini cini and maybe they're different.  I got two, one with cream cheese icing, the other amaretto.  I ate the cream cheese one asap and found it to be dry and pretty boring.  Today I heated up the amaretto and thought that would help.  It didn't.  Maybe a topping would make them a little more flavorful.  I'll probably give it another try down the road and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan cinnamon buns. Friendly staff. Prompt service. What more could a gal ask for?"}
{"text":"You would never take a guess it's Vegan!! No guilt here, the ambiance is very chill and they provide grate customer service. Will definitely be coming back for more. Everything is pretty much customizable to your liking, which is Awesome! Mine was delicious, went with cream cheese frosting, topped with bananas,strawberries and almonds."}
{"text":"Because even Vegans love dessert! Cinnaholic specializes in customizable cinnamon rolls- your choice of flavored icing and various toppings, on a huge classic roll or their miniature \"baby buns\". They also have cakes, brownies, and cookies (and raw dough), as well as fresh coffee available.  For my first visit, I went for a PBJ vibe with peanut butter frosting, fresh sliced strawberries, and chopped almonds- it was bomb. Staff aren't stingy with the toppings, either! I was a little surprised at the total cost, which was just shy of $7 but the portion was enough for two. Roll itself is large, gooey and the consistency was spot on.   Each visit, staff are friendly and quick despite the line. I do wish they opened earlier- I suppose you can eat a cinnamon roll any time you like but they're more of a breakfast food and the 10AM opening is only feasible for most on weekends. At least they're located right by my gym!"}
{"text":"So I stopped by to say hi to a friend, but he was not working. So I figured I was at a bakery and might as well get a cinnamon roll.  After reading all the reviews about this place I would have to say they are all correct. The food was awesome and so good, plus the customer service was great. Next time I go I will not look for my friend and just get a cinnamon roll. LOL"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh.....So many choices and every single one is delicious! I love that you get to choose toppings and frosting.  Wish they had a menu you take with you so you could plan ahead."}
{"text":"This was an amazing little place to grab a snack! Easily the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"If you need a vegan sweet this is the place to go. On our first visit the staff were more than accomodating and helpful. They described the menu and ingredients and walked us through their process. They have a points card assigned to a phone number so you can get free cinnamon rolls later.   I had the caramel frosting with apples and it was SO good! Not too sweet, apples were nice and fresh and it tasted great. Can't wait to go back for the other million combos!"}
{"text":"Cinnamon is one of my favorite flavors. We were over on the west side on Monday and we noticed a business called Cinnaholic which made \"Gourmet Cinnamon Rolls\" so we just had to stop in and check it out. I got a basic cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting and my GF got one with cream cheese frosting and pecans. We paid about $11.00 for the two rolls.  When I began eating my cinnamon roll I noticed a few things: the frosting tasted off and weird, with a chemical flavor that reminded me of dish soap. The texture of the frosting was not smooth, it was grainy in a way I'd never seen before. The roll itself had virtually no cinnamon taste; it just tasted like a lump of baked dough even though I could see brown streaks in it.  Also, it was impossible for us to tell the difference between the vanilla and the cream cheese frosting; both appeared and tasted exactly the same. I didn't finish my roll because it just didn't taste like a cinnamon roll should, and I wondered how a business that did nothing but make cinnamon rolls could mess this up.  Curious, I went to the company's website and I found the answer: these were vegan cinnamon rolls. There was no notification about this anywhere on the outside or inside the store and the worker who sold us the rolls never mentioned it. It seems they don't want to let their customers know that they're not getting regular cinnamon rolls. This to me is deceptive, bordering on being fraudulent, much like a bar that will sell you a beer and then when you ask why the taste is different after you've paid for it they tell you their beer doesn't contain alcohol.  I have nothing against vegans or veganism. I'm sure people who practice veganism have good reasons for removing animal products from their diets and I respect that. But I am not a vegan, and if a business that sells me a food item that usually contains animal products has removed all animal products from that item I want to know about it before I make a purchase decision. To conceal this knowledge from me is in my view simply a flat-out bait-and-switch and an extremely bad business practice.   In the company website's FAQ one of the questions is \"Why don't you advertise your products as vegan in your store?\" Their answer is \"...To us, living a vegan lifestyle and consuming vegan products is normal! Why treat it like it's not?\"    Well, let's put the shoe on the other foot: If I am a vegan I will want to know if animal products are used in the food I buy, right?  And if I am a vegan am I going to be satisfied with a food vendor telling me \"To us, living a non-vegan lifestyle and consuming animal products is normal! Why treat it like it's not?\"  We all know the answer."}
{"text":"If you have a huge sweet tooth, then it's a great dessert to have. It's nice that it's vegan however I didn't think it was out of this world or anything. It's too sweet for me and just not very satisfying. But if you love cinnamon buns, this is a great option since they have several ways to top it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet as I've been 5 times already was even here for the Grand Opening $1 Roll event.  I LOVE this place, I follow the business on FB as they won Shark Tank and is based West Coast. Imagine the joy I felt once I read they were coming to NC and being Vegan it was even more exciting as I don't get many Vegan GOOD dessert choices here. I don't eat dessert often but when I do I would like something tasty and memorable.  This place fits the bill both tasty and memorable. There are so many options and combinations you can do with the icing flavor and the toppings that you will keep coming back to try the next and the next and the next (at least that's my excuse for multiple visits plus I've taken out of town guest.  This place was a madhouse my first 3 visits as it was still SUPER new. It was a little better as far as crowd by visit 4 and super easy in and out on visit 5 which was this past weekend.  I enjoyed the Queen City roll on grand opening day and our toddler had the Birthday cake roll which he gets every visit now. My husband favorite is orange icing with walnuts. I've had lemon and coconut as well as vanilla and almonds.  Overall this place is a keeper"}
{"text":"Best cinnamon roll Iv ever had . Highly recommended. You can pick your own frosting and toppings the home made cookie dough is amazing also ."}
{"text":"Amazing service and a delicious menu! As soon as you walk in you can smell the deliciousness being made, they had a great options in their display and the peanut butter banana stood out to me so I ordered it. It didn't take more than a few minutes and my order was ready. The size of the cinnamon roll alone was well worth it, the toppings on mine which were fresh chopped bananas with peanut butter just mixed so well that it melted in my mouth. I have found my spot for light and tasty sweets"}
{"text":"Delicious food and a great atmosphere! The staff is really friendly and helpful, the options were endless and everything tasted fantastic. I prefer Cinnaholic over Cinnabon any day, and afterwards I don't feel like I ate too much even after finishing the whole thing! PB & banana is my fave so far and I would def recommend trying it! Besides being super clean the bathrooms also had some cool art painted on the walls. All around a great experience from the staff to the food."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! This place is beyond delicious. I can proudly say I'm a Cinnaholic! First of all its extremely clean and you can see them make your order. You get to choose from a delicious array of Vegan frostings and  toppings. I didn't know Vegan could be so flavorful and of perfect texture.  I ordered the Banana Foster roll and my BF ordered a cinnamon roll with caramel frosting and fresh blueberries, strawberries,  and Raspberries. It was beautiful looking,  warm, and fresh. The fruit was so fresh and highlighted the frosting on top of the warm cinnamon roll. Yummy!!! On top of all of that. The staff was very polite. Everyone greeted everybody and checked on us several times while we enjoyed our sweets. We will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. I would be willing to try this place again for a special occasion but overall I didn't feel the food was worth the price. The selection is excellent and it was a fun experience, but $21 for 3 average size cinnamon rolls is a bit outrageous to me. The idea of gourmet cinnamon rolls is excellent, but the execution of their ingredients was simply ok. The dough itself is lacking flavor and the toppings were a bit over-sweet (relatively speaking). We had: 1) the \"twix\" which had caramel, peanut butter topping, and Oreo cookie piece 2) cream cheese topping with fresh strawberries 3) pumpkin spice topping with marshmallow  I prefer Pink Box Donuts over this place, but it is nice to have another option.   The store was clean and has some seating. The staff was very friendly and I wish them success."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite thing to eat in the whole wide world.   Delicious, warm, gooey cinnamon rolls topped with the frosting flavors and toppings of your choice. Even better? It's vegan!  My personal fave is cake batter frosting with cookie dough topping. Their cookie dough is made there (and vegan as well) and absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"This place is literally heaven on earth. I absolutely love cinnamon rolls and to have one so close to me is fantastic. I'm more of a regular cinnamon bun kind of gal, but they also have other flavors. That cookie one is pretty legit. I need to try them all!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I got hazelnut frosting with chocolate chips. OMG so good. Super sweet, but worth it!  Place was clean. They have a menu to make it simple for u to order. We told the employee it was our first time, and was helpful in assisting us. She wasn't the friendliest or the most outgoing but atleast she was willing to help I guess. I took a star off since she seemed like she didn't necessarily wanna be there.  I also wish they had fountain drinks but they offer bottled water milk and juice"}
{"text":"We ordered 3 cinnamon rolls and the frosting and toppings are not my choice of delicious desserts. I would not recommend this place. Cashier was nice but young lady had a bad attitude."}
{"text":"This is Vegan? Seriously? Yum!  Unbeknownst to me, this was a vegan dessert place.  Vegan dessert? Sure I'll try it.  The diary free, egg free and cholesterol free cinnamon roll tastes wonderful.  My friends and I split the bananas foster option - a delicious roll topped with almond icing, bananas and caramel drizzle.  It's definitely as good as it sounds.  The warm roll melts in your mouth but also in your hands!   For the more creative eaters out there, you can customize your cinnamon roll with types of icing and toppings.  They are very quick and efficient in getting your lovely dessert out to you.    I am a fan with hopes of visiting again real soon!"}
{"text":"Not much of a fan on cinnamon rolls but Cinnaholic is the bomb with all their variety of frosting and toppings, the dough is light and fluffy. Owners and staff were friendly, courteous and attentive. I would recommend Cinnaholic to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"Frosty weather calls for freshly baked cinnamon rolls customized by your pallet! Today we devilishly divulged in a sinful cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting, topped with walnuts and cookie dough. Also, on the table are two baby buns with chocolate frosting!   I have frequented this place 5 times and I foresee plenty more visits."}
{"text":"Mmm all yummy goodness coming from this place! I was so excited they made one in the Northwest so I couldn't wait to stop in for a bun. When my boyfriend I arrived it smelled so delicious inside and there was only one couple there so the service was very quick.   You start with a delicious cinnamon bun which is vegan. You can choose what frosting you want, and they have soo many choices! Then you can choose any toppings you want and they have tons. If you are indecisive or don't know what would be good together, they also offer an extensive menu for pre-designed buns which is where I picked mine.   The bun was a little overcooked, not too gooey but it did taste delightful. I absolutely love frosting so the more, the merrier and there was plenty! The pricing isn't too bad either, about $7 a bun which I thought was reasonable.   The only con I had for this restaurant is that the person who was helping us at the counter didn't crack a smile and wasn't friendly at all in helping us. However, I will be back to enjoy another cinnamon bun in the future!"}
{"text":"The best cinnamon rolls ever! And there VEGAN!!!!!!!  Beware you may get addicted. I drive all the way across town just to have one and every time I go I run into my family and friends and we just laugh because we know we need to stay away at least a day or 2 lol"}
{"text":"Various flavors of cinnamon roll icing.  So many to choose from and they have a great selection of house favorites.  Not a bad place for desserts. I got a couple different types. After a while they all tasted the same though.  It is a must try, but try to stick with just 1 flavor"}
{"text":"Waited about 10 minutes to put in my order then waited about 10-15 more minutes to actually get our two cinnamon rolls and one of them was just a classic roll. Got home to eat them and the frosting wasn't even on top of the roll. The other one was the pb and chocolate roll and I honestly didn't like it at all. Just go to the grocery store where you can get 12 rolls for $5, better quality and only takes likes 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Love the concept of \"build your own cinnamon roll\"love the different mixes and toppings that you can chose. Would definitely come back to try other things!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with my sister, we just driving by, and I suggested we stop by to give it try. We looked it up online and saw many great reviews. Seeing that, we went inside, ordered a regular cinnamon roll, and even though they offer multiple toppings (Which is so cool!). When it came down to trying the cinnamon roll, it was DELICIOUS. Best dessert ever, I found out it's not that high in calories, dairy free, and vegan free. I'm definitely coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Cinnaholic in Henderson Green Valley is officially open for business! Cute place, there's seating inside enough room to fit a bunch of screaming toddlers in strollers.  Got 2 custom rolls. One with Banana Cream icing, strawberries and Graham crackers. One is supposed to be Lemon Icing and Blueberry but it's bananas and walnuts.. stuff I'm allergic to.  Guess I got the wrong order or the guy taking my order was just hasty ... at least the customer before me got lucky. He left his wallet in the car so the cashier waved it off and he got his cinnaholic rolls for free.  I was able to tear a piece off and try it. They're okay...texture great, but lacking something...they make up for it on toppings I guess... what they have going for them it's Vegan.. so they'll appeal more to the Vegan community... but I'll stick to the local small business shop Mothership Coffee, they have  awesome vegan pastries there... and Chef Flemming's and CRAFTkitchen for cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"My dad and I had previously been to the Berkeley location to try out the vegan cinnamon buns I've been hearing so much about and couldn't believe how good they are! Now, every time we visit a state with a Cinnaholic, we just have to come by! Sure, they aren't the healthiest vegan option out there but they are super delicious and worth a try! Can't wait until they expand to Toronto!!"}
{"text":"This place is magical! What could be better for a vegan sweet tooth than a build your own cinnamon bun?! Cinnaholic has just turned the ceiling into the sky as far as limitations of delicious vegan desserts go.  These are not your average cinnamon buns. They are DELICIOUS gourmet cinnamon buns of decadent proportion that you can personalize according to your taste! They even have the cutest baby buns if you only need a smaller piece of heaven.   Employees seem to take pride in accommodating first time customer questions and truly make you feel so welcome! I'm so happy to have such a passionate new bakery here in the Valley and it blows my mind completely that it's all vegan. Plus, where else are you going to find FRESH cinnamon buns? The airport? The mall? Please..."}
{"text":"I got the turtle.. for some odd reason, it tasted like whiskey to me. On a side note, the cinnamon roll itself was great and so was their frosting."}
{"text":"Cool concept and cinnamon rolls are good, but not amazing. Can customize rolls or get pre-made ones. Lots of icing flavors and toppings to choose from. Got cream cheese frosting and pecans. Warm and yummy, but didnt taste the cream cheese. Sister got hazelnut icing and pie crumble. Hers was ok it tasted like a fall scented candle lol. Staff is super friendly and fast. Great location, but dont think I would come again because the actual roll isnt soft and flaky like Cinnabon. Toppings are .50 each, so a bit pricey. I think they could benefit from doing different prices for 2 or 3 toppings and selling coffee. Wouldnt come back unless I was craving cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"We have dairy allergies in the family and are limited to good sweets but this place is delicious and accommodating to our needs. We got the original cinnamon roll, brownie and cookie dough. All were delicious and rich. The rolls are huge! No one will ever guess vegan too! Price is decent so this place definitely makes the list of splurges."}
{"text":"Space: There are not that many tables so if you have a big party this place may not be ideal.  Service: You order what you want and they make It in the back and bring It to you.   Price: It is about $6+ for a cinnamon roll.   Food:  There are so many options on the display and you can customize It however you would like  Notes: There is no way that one person can finish a cinnamon roll, I would say 2-3 people are able to share one. It is very sweet so if you don't have a sweet tooth, you wouldn't like this plce"}
{"text":"This is my second review (first being their location in the southwest) and I'm a happy camper!  Really stoked that they have one a bit closer to where I'm living now.  As a huge plus, everything is VEGAN and delicious. The only negative is that I probably cant eat one every day.. but I would if I could! Everything is so fresh here and always exactly how you want it. They even let you sample the frosting first to see if it's going to work perfectly with your pallet.  5 stars all day baby."}
{"text":"Amazing! We've been twice and can't wait to go back! The people who run the shop are wonderful and so great to work with especially when you need to call ahead for a big order. Alfredo is the best! They put out a quality product that is always warm, gooey and delicious! Love this place!"}
{"text":"OMG this is the a place of deliciousness OMG this heaven!!! The customization of the orders and the special builds and orders. This place is the kryptonite to cinnabun. Cinnabun is a non factor to these guys. The customer service is amazing I'm sure they will be a Vegas staple in no time definitely bound to take over. I'm also a major fan of the pleather of combinations to choose from."}
{"text":"This morning was my first experience at Cinnaholic, and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. We ended up getting 6 rolls in different flavors to-go to celebrate a coworkers birthday. We were so excited to open the box and see the beautiful cinnamon rolls we had seen so many pictures of, but instead we were greeted with 6 bread rolls and a huge puddle of melted frosting. All the flavors had mixed together, and even though there was only 1 banana flavor, all of them ended up tasting like banana. For how expensive these were, we were definitely expecting better presentation. Had we known that getting them to-go would have resulted in this frosting disaster, we would have thought twice about getting these. Highly unlikely we will return in the future."}
{"text":"I stopped by on a slow Saturday morning to get myself and my lady and the kiddos a tasty treat. To my dismay there were no cinnamon rolls made!? I had to wait 16 minutes but I didn't mind being that they were gonna be fresh, So I ordered 4 special rolls with all different toppings on them. They were a good concept, fresh fruit, chocolate, great toppings.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is that the rolls seemed to be made from frozen dough and not from scratch..it had a Pillsbury taste and texture to it..I have had better rolls to compare it to so i was disappointed, the kids liked it. 26 bucks..well I dunno.."}
{"text":"I'm ready to go back! Soon as you walk in your nose is hit with the most amazing, sweet, freshly baked, scent of cinnamon buns. I could go there just to breathe the air alone. The cinnamon buns were probably the best I've ever had. I had what was called an Almond Joy (like an Almond Joy candy bar in cinnamon bun form) and my friend had the Cookie Monster (had a chocolate icing and pieces of chocolate chip cookies atop) Both were amazing and we couldn't stop eating them! Will be returning to try other flavors!"}
{"text":"First time trying out some vegan desserts and these are definitely good.  I'll definitely be back for more.  These are just as good as any other cinnamon rolls out there."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I was so excited for this place to open I went on a Tuesday just after grand opening, which is 5 days after it opened. I was greeted but a young gal who told me all the things I needed to know. I ordered a \"Regular roll with Cream cheese frosting and Carmel. And I was charged $5.95. Just after we got our order my husband asked the lady why it was so much and she said, I was charged for an \"old school roll\" ($4.75) Cream Cheese frosting ($.50) and the Carmel ($.25) plus tax. The problem is the \"old school roll\" (4.74)  comes with vanilla frosting. The plain roll is $4.25 and then you get charged for any frosting. I paid for double frosting but I didn't ask for it AND I didn't get it. I know I only over paid by $.50 but that's still a rip off. I didn't care that much because I really wanted to eat what I thought was going to be an amazing roll. Sadly, it was not that great. It's lacking in the cinnamon department. It's more of a sweet roll with frosting. It's not worth $5.00 each! I'll probably give it some time and try again when they are more seasoned at running the place and not over charging for nothing. Also we went on Tuesday at noon and it was EMPTY! It doesn't open until 10am so good luck staying open.     ****Update****** I was contacted by the owner and was told that, I was charged correctly. So I'm going to give it a 3 stars which is a so-so review. I was also told that they would take my lack of cinnamon in the rolls comment and review it.  The roll was soft and the frosting was good but at that price I can not justify getting them very often. If they add more cinnamon to the roll then they might really have something great. With that being said, when you add all the \"crazy\" topping on the roll, like chocolate and peanut butter and things like that, I can understand not having a strong cinnamon flavor which might not work well with all those flavors, but when you want the classic, and it's $5.00 each, you really want it to be the BEST classic you've ever had. You should give this place a try if you want the crazy flavors, who doesn't love having choices?  Like I said in my first review, I will give it another try, but I'll be hoping to have the best cinnamon roll ever!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a Cinnamon Roll? I had to wait 10 minutes, ad they were baking fresh rolls. No big deal. It came out nice and warm. And they are huge! I'm talking Diabetic Coma huge. I ordered a Cream cheese with Cookie Dough topping. Are they sure these are really Vegan!? The cookie dough tasted like Grandma's Homemade cookies!   Don't they come in mini? Will have to ask. I will be back!"}
{"text":"These bad boys helped me get through a massive surgery and recovery and still be happy! Best cinnamon rolls I've had in a LONG time! The variety is unlike any other!"}
{"text":"A great classic cinnamon roll... way better than your average Cinnabon roll. Fresh, fluffy dough, the frosting is the best part. You can tell it's homemade. There's a special twist to it that just tastes so awesome. I'll definitely be back to try more.   I also love the fact that it's a \"build your own\" cinnamon roll so you can add a bunch of different flavoring and toppings. Today I just stuck with a class roll to try them out for the first time.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Uhhhhhhhmazing. I was in Atlanta during NYE weekend looking for a good dessert place and this came up. A few months later one was opening 10 minutes away from me?? Heck yeah! I went tonight, super busy but it ended up being worth the wait."}
{"text":"Stupid good. Got coffee frosting with our crust topping. My son nabbed banana cream with pie crust."}
{"text":"Great food, totally would recommend this to everyone in Nevada. The employees were so great. They were friendly and took their time to explain how to do it. 10/10"}
{"text":"The most delicious gourmet vegan cinnamon rolls around are found here at Cinnaholic.  With over 40 options between frosting flavors and toppings, you can create your dream roll.  The price is reasonable considering the gourmet ingredients, however this establishment can get busy at times--resulting in a longer than desirable wait time.  They either need more staff or an additional oven to keep up with customer demand.  Overall, it is an excellent place to stop by to enjoy a delectable treat. Once you have a taste, you will want to come back for more.  Before you know it, you'll be a Cinnaholic!"}
{"text":"100% Vegan?! Is this real life?! Yes, yes it is.   This place is amazing. The cinnamon rolls are amazing. The prices are amazing. The baby buns are the cutest thing ever and perfect for both my kids. They are so generous with the toppings and everything we tried tasted incredible!   We live in Henderson so the 25-30 minute drive REALLY sucks so, hopefully we can get one over here soon but please believe that drive won't keep me away. So worth it.   The prices of the drinks are a little ridiculous ($3.25 for one small water) which is a trap because you definitely need a drink after your sweet tooth takes a hit.   But other than that they are doing everything right!"}
{"text":"Custom cinnamon rolls? Sign me up. After spotting a drool worthy photo of one of their rolls on my Instagram feed, I knew I had to check this place out. After more visits than I should probably admit to (my lack of check ins do not accurately represent my actual visit count ;) it's safe to say that I'm a fan. After my first taste of their cinnamon rolls...I completely forgot that they were vegan. Simply AMAZING.  If you don't know what combination to do: I recommend the Almond frosting with bananas, raspberries, blueberries, and pie crumbs :)"}
{"text":"Stood in line for over an hour today and was so disappointed. My cinnamon roll didn't look anything like the pictures. I ordered a cinnamon roll with chocolate icing and almonds, and the cinnamon in the roll overpowered the toppings and the roll itself was underbaked. Pillsbury Grands are a better option and a much better price. Cinnaholic is way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"So far I've tried the classic old school version and the Ohio buckeye version with chocolate and peanut butter. Both were good but neither was as good as Cinnabon. Plus, Cinnaholic is more expensive. I guess if you want various flavors on top of your roll, this is the place to go. If you just want a cinnamon roll, Cinnabon is better."}
{"text":"Amazing!! And Vegan but NOT gluten free. All is tasty! Its out choice for dessert all the time."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. I went here to try it out, no way will I be back. the cinnamon roll was ok, I didn't get any special toppings on it, my issue is with the pricing. cinnabun doesn't even rip off as much as this place does. I felt like a fool paying what I paid. something like $15 for 2 cinnamon rolls...I wasn't expecting that.  best to go here if you got a coupon or something, but to pay or outright, no way. $5 each for a cinnamon roll...I can get 8 of them from Costco for $4. #smartshopper"}
{"text":"It was and is so Amazing!!! Staff was awesome as well!!! Keep up the Amazing work!!! And congrats on the new location!!! Much love!!!!"}
{"text":"The cinnamon rolls are amazing! But the service is Always.. not. The girl here today was less than enthusiastic about being here. My 2 year old told her \"thank you!\" When she brought the rolls to the counter, she didn't even acknowledge :-/ no thank you, or you're welcome or anything during the interaction of ordering. Thumbs down. Customer service is the reason people come back."}
{"text":"Every time I am on this side of town I make sure to get something from here. Brownies, cookies, and cinnabuns O MY!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Most non vegans say it doesn't taste vegan because it's honestly so delicious. A little on the rich side but if you're going to indulge this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!  Captain america 5/5 Strawberry frosting/banana 4/5 Orchata frosting/ ginger snap 4/5  Downfall... poor drink selection. I prefer soda... ALL OF THE TIME."}
{"text":"It takes quite a bit to impress me and I was not impressed in the least, considering all of the hubbub that was made. Had a classic cinnamon roll and it was way over priced. The taste was not like it was mouth watering.  Price should be around 2.50. Yeah, you can get them with a lot of stuff on them but personally I like to taste the cinnamon bun and not all that other stuff.  Was also expecting a nice place to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee with my roll but the place is more like get it an go. Big let down for me. I will give them kudos for the to go containers however."}
{"text":"Vegan NO dairy products  Sinfully yummy  One can get in trouble living too close to here- beware Cinnabon your a thing of the past"}
{"text":"Cinnaholic is near the 215 and flamingo. The cinnamon rolls are fantastic. There are lots of frosting and toppings to choose from thatcher all vegan. They also have brownies, cookie dough and mini buns and cinnacakes. I wanna have my next bday cake be a cinnacake.  The staff is great and now there a rewards program that allows you to earn free cinnamon rolls. That's great news! Or bad if you consider all the cinnamon rolls I'll be buying lol... Its far from me but it's an easy drive there and back because it's right off the 215.  Go there today and try a cinnamon roll if you haven't had one yet. And then.... Take your friends. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Three words. . . A Maz Ing!! My family and I were visiting Las Vegas last week and I needed to find some dairy free desserts to enjoy during our visit.  I saw the rave reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm so happy that I did!  I bought two rolls on my first visit: bananas foster with pecans and I  created the second roll had cream cheese, chocolate, caramel and pecans. Both were beyond delicious. My daughter also created her own with vanilla frosting and Oreos.  We were in Las Vegas for 4 days and I had to return before we left for more cinnamon rolls goodness. I joined the loyalty club on my first visit even though there isn't a store in my State. I'm glad I did because I earned a free roll on my visit.  I brought goodies home with me and have them and the frosting in my freezer. I'm going to visit Las Vegas a little bit more often now to support my vegan cinnamon rolls addiction!"}
{"text":"I mean- cookie dough and cream cheese on a cinnamon roll. Seriously? Yes please. So good."}
{"text":"Excellent cinnamon rolls with a great variety of flavors & sooo many options to choose. They baked them in front of you, so that's a plus. Really home made bakery. The shop is clean, & love the name, so creative...\"but\" the customer service is not that good. Overall experience was good!"}
{"text":"My wife and i were ecstatic to hear that cinnaholic was opening on our side of town! We used to make the drive way south just to get some but now we can go ALL or the time!  If you have a sweet tooth, which some people may not have (especially after reading some reviews) then this place is for you! I feen for sweetness and this place hits the spot! Every roll we've tried has been delicious. My personal favorite is the captain america roll.  This venue is bigger than its sister shop south. The service is great and the employees are friendly.  Although i would love to give this place a 5 star i just cant. The prices are high and i get it.... they are premium cinnamon rolls but still. And their variety in drinks are not so great either.  Again, i get it. Its a healthy-ish snack shop, but I love my rolls with a nice cold coke. So my wife always brings a can of coke with us. Minor right? Nope, not to me... a coke is a must!!!   Either way, i love this place!"}
{"text":"I went to a Cinnaholic in Colorado and this one is a million times better!  Our cinnamon rolls were warm and delicious.  The service was sweet and speedy!  I highly recommend this cinnaholic location!"}
{"text":"I have been look for a scrumptious dessert for a while now. I got the caramel coffee cinnamon roll and I had every intention to take a picture post it on Yelp! but from the time I received it and then walked to my car it was to late, that is one of the better cinnamon rolls I have ever had. I would give it 5 but it only got 3 because I thought it was a bit over priced and the cashier didn't let me slide for $.25 so I had to walk out to the car to get another quarter. I'd probably only go again to take my kids so they can try it."}
{"text":"Hella crackin.. I like to stop at cinnabon every once in awhile but how could I after trying this new treat?  The roll was warm and soft from inside to the outter edge. I went for old fashioned frosting and a Carmel sauce topping because I wanted to compare to cinnabon. The frosting was night and day better. So light and airy. It wasent thick and rich like cinnabon and I much more perfer it this way.   Wifey got coffee Carmel which was very good but the best part of the trip was the price. Very reasonable for such a delicous treat. We will go back soon."}
{"text":"The cookie monster taste good lots of sugar  well worth the additional 10 min wait. After an attempt to visit during their grand opening, I made it my business to drive 42 mins for the sugar rush."}
{"text":"How can I even begin to explain what a dream Cinnaholic is? They are an ever-growing chain across the States and also looking to expand within Canada (currently they have one location in the North).   Upon walking in to the clean, bright storefront in Henderson the sweet aroma of cinnamon buns hits you in the face. I've been vegan for 8 years now and I always curse Cinnabon when I walk by in the mall, so this was a dream come true to walk in and know absolutely everything is vegan.   They have a display with ready made cinnamon buns, brownies and cookies. But you can also create your own from the menu posted on the wall. You can choose your favourite frosting, as well as toppings of your choosing (extra cost per topping).   They also have a fridge with bottled water and Silk milk.   They have a decent amount of seating so you can sit in or takeout your treats.   I got the cookie monster which is a ready made one because it just looked so amazing and it indeed was. Super decadent and sweet but so good! And even better than I ever remember Cinnabon being!   I hope to see a Cinnaholic near me someday! :)"}
{"text":"When you walk in, this place instantly smells so sweet.  It's clean and the people there are nice and friendly.    I ordered the coconut cream pie cinnamon bun that they were featuring.Their cinnamon rolls are soft and fresh. The bun also comes warm if you order for here. I was actually surprised that the bun I ordered wasn't overwhelming sweet. So it was very delicious! All their buns are also Vegan, so everyone can come here. :D"}
{"text":"Amazing! I can't believe it's vegan! They are soft and taste buttery. Love that you can pick a variety of toppings to Create your own or pick the pre picked combos!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended this place. So fun to have so many different flavors of icing and topping to choose from....and best of all it all tastes AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place was so sugary I divulged two fatal flaws in my character as a human being: 1) lack of attention as I threw into the trashcan the plastic oval container holding the wrapper waste after my conquest was complete. I apologized and offered to dumpster dive to retrieve it from the waste bin, to which the nice employee said \"don't worry about it, I'll get it.\" and 2) \"now that dinner is complete, it is time for dessert\" I realized that we do have to feed our weaknesses sometimes in order to realize that we are still human and, hey, deserve to treat ourselves before we kick the bucket.  I cannot even recall what I had since the temperature in Vegas was 113F. But it had mesmerizing caramel shiny drizzle with brown sugar on the whipped cream on the cinnamon that was bigger THAN AN INFANT'S HEAD.  Forget the Vegas show(s)(girls), just go here...but DO NOT eat before coming here or you will spoil your appetite.  The only real things in Vegas are: the money coming out of your wallet, the summer temperatures, the great Mexican food, and this cinnamon bun!"}
{"text":"Good dough and cinnamon rolls but slow and bad service.  Just came in today and we ordered, and were told to wait about 7 mins. We sat at a dirty table and when the only worker saw us wiping it down, she wiped down every table except ours, before making our rolls even! Then another customer came in and ordered and she made the roll and put it all together before she even looked to even start with our food!! They don't give out water cups, you have to buy the bottled water, but Friends was on the tv so it was all good anyways."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I bought into the hype. I saw shark tank, I read the reviews, and I was your perfect fan girl. I went in Sunday night, place was clean, quiet, and smelled super yummy. The girls working were all super nice. They explained the menu and I ordered. I ordered a classic, a roll with cream cheese, and a roll with coffee cream and a bunch of toppings. Once I got the food... that's where it all went wrong. The dough outer area was hard and seemed stale. The frosting was all a weird texture and had a weird hint of something.... almond extract? Not sure. But there wasn't much of a discintion between frosting flavors. The rolls were barely warm. If you're looking for a cinnabun, this is not your place. Will have to go to cinnabon to get my fix. Even the cinnamon sugar between the roll was very gritty. I understand they're vegan and this is prob a great alternative for those who can't or won't eat dairy, but don't set your hopes high like it did. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"What I look for in places other than what they serve is customer service and how pleasant the employees are with their customers. I went in there today this morning and the gentlemen had absolutely no interest in helping me, since it was my first time at Cinnaholic (no other customers were around) it wasn't busy so I had questions on what they offered and did they handle bulk orders. The gentlemen asked \"what are you looking for?\" With a ugh kinda attitude, I just ordered something small since I was there, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast. The line was almost out the door! Good sign by my standards! The options for frosting flavors and toppings was amazing. The rolls themselves were soft and warm. I chose the Classic with Vanilla frosting, no toppings. It was delicious. Generous amount of frosting to last eating the whole roll!! We now have a new breakfast option. Highly recommend this new business that was featured on Shark Tank!!"}
{"text":"Cinnamon buns... yes please! Everything is plant based and delicious. You can either choose from their list of cinnamon buns or create your own! So many different frostings and toppings to choose from. Omg and their cookie dough!! I had to stop myself from buying a container of it haha"}
{"text":"I was given a decadent buttery bun by at work. This cinnamon roll changed my life. It's so delicious! I can't wait until they open in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Ordered two cinnamon rolls. The rolls themselves were stale. Frosting wasn't anything special. Cinnabon in comparison is much better. Really disappointed, I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Great stuff! Lots of different toppings! You're able to customize to your liking and you get a pretty big cinnamon roll for your money."}
{"text":"ADDICTED!! Im obsessed with cinnamon rolls as it is already! Then they open this place like right by my house omg. Since they opened this month Ive visited every week. Can not believe how amazing they taste. So fresh. The ability to customize  your own cinnamon roll and make it your own is awesome. I try and switch it up when I come. I enjoy the creme cheese frosting the most so far.  This is my new favorite dessert place. OH also, their brownies and cookie dough is so good!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place from others, we decided to stop and try them out.  When you initially enter and inhale, the aroma was just delicious!  It took us a few minutes to figure out what would pair well together, we ended up with a cookie monster and a smores bun.  This store is vegan, and its advertised on a tiny sticker next to the register.  Overall a great spot and we will be back!  The ingredients don't make you feel \"heavy\" or sleepy like the traditional Cinnamon Bun spots.  The reason minus the 1 star, the clerk did not say hello when patrons entered and when your order was for dining in, she didn't inform the customers.  I sit back and observe the service others receive to be fair."}
{"text":"Delicious cinnamon rolls. Always fresh. So many icing choices and toppings !! If you enjoy a good cinnamon roll - you'll love this place !! Staff are always very accommodating and courteous."}
{"text":"This is probably the biggest disappointment of any dessert place I could possibly find. I literally just walked out of Cinnaholic and my fingers had to type a review. I've tried coming twice late nights before they closed, and they have closed way before their closing time. Maybe it's just me, but if some place says they close at 8PM or 9PM, you stay open till those hours and clean after.  Today's visit started with me explaining to the cashier it was my first time. She was kind and said start with a frosting and topping or pick from the display case. I thought cool already made styles I'll do that. She rung me up and said it's $6.50. I thought holy sh!t! That's a lot for a cinnamon bun. And needless to say 10 minutes later not the worth. It was empty and not filling. And just overly sweet. The flavor I chose was caramel coffee cake. I tasted zero caramel, absolutely zero coffee, and I'm so weirded out it had granola on there. That's a really weird topping. I would expect more strudel clusters. Needless to say I don't cone back and urge to change your prices. $6.50 for a cinnamon bun.... ridiculous.  Oh and it would be nice too if the employees didn't rant about their personal lives, and be drinking water while making my food."}
{"text":"Cinnabon more like Cinnagone, these rolls will bless your soul!!! I've gone here with my son multiple times I always get the Old Skool. I have No idea how they make such great rolls without dairy products. I'm pretty sure this place is vegan friendly as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing desserts!!! All vegan too. After becoming vegan, I didn't think I'd be able to enjoy a cinnamon roll taste anymore and this hit the spot. Tastes amazing, and was super light. Brownie was the best brownie I've had since my vegan change and the cookies, also phenomenal!!! This is my new sweet spot."}
{"text":"I ordered the mini buns and tried them when I got home.  I had chosen plain cream cheese as the topping and it was a bit sour and sweet.  I wasn't sure if this was meant to be.  A few hours later, my stomach hurt.  These buns were not as delicious as their franchised counterpart, I don't find myself coming back here. Frankly, I think their prices are a bit steep for the taste and quality."}
{"text":"Great place to go for cinnamon buns... Not sure what flavor??? They will let you sample the frostings to help you decide. Service is great. I had to wait for my cinnamon bun to finish baking and they gave me a mini bun to enjoy while I was waiting. Vegan??? I had no clue, but I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the classic and Oreo and they are both amazing. There service was good and the place is clean. If you like cinnamon rolls I highly recommend you check them out."}
{"text":"While you have to wait a good bit to order, the cinnamon buns are delicious. We ordered the peanut butter syrup with cookie dough topping and it came out to be about $6. Considering it's such a new take on desserts, I thought the price was fair."}
{"text":"I love cinnamon rolls, they have a special place in my heart and this place does not disappoint. It's so good here and I love how customizable you can make your cinnamon rolls, never imagined you could put so many toppings on one but here we are and it's amazing. Another plus is that it's all vegan and you would never know! I got the lemon tart with light frosting and it was so good I also substituted the pie crumbs for gram crackers, we also got the caption America and cookie dough with peanut butter jelly, which I really liked but I can't eat all together because it's so sweet, over all I love this place and you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Such a fitting name because they are truly addicting. Some of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! I have no idea how something vegan can taste so buttery. My faves: amaretto frosting w/almonds, strawberry frosting with berries."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were super stoked to try Vegan cinnamon rolls. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. This place is garbage and the employees working there are completely unprofessional. After we placed our order for one old school cinnamon roll, we had to wait 10 minutes for one cinnamon roll. We didn't mind the wait. But during the wait one of the employees let out a huge f-bomb saying she forgot to put napkins somewhere. When we finally got our cinnamon roll, we took a bite and the frosting tasted like straight up butter. Since butter isn't vegan, beware of eating here. We asked the same employee who said the f-word out loud, what was the frosting and the cinnamon roll made out of, and she had no idea. This place is the worst and I'd rather make cinnamon rolls at home then go here. Seriously, DO NOT GO HERE. I will be telling all of my friends and family not to go here."}
{"text":"SOOOO good!   I saw Cinnaholic on my news feed as someone had bookmarked it so I couldn't help but click to see what all the stars were about! A cinnamon bun place?! Tell me more!   Talked my co-worker into going during our lunch break today. I went with the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana and my co-worker went with the Blueberry. I KILLED it. It was so good, the icing so delicious. I've never had a better cinnamon bun.   My only complaint was that it wasn't served warm. I wish I could give 4.5 stars for this rating and add the half star back had it been served warm.   My co-worker couldn't finish the Blueberry so I may have finished the 1/3 of that that was left, in addition to finishing mine in its entirety... Don't judge!   I will definitely be going back and if you haven't tried it yet, make sure you do!"}
{"text":"Omg huge and delicious!  For the cure for the sweet tooth this is the place.  Awesome service!!' You have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! The best cinnamon bun I've had ! It was so delicious  But as good as it was i couldn't finish one by myself... it's super sweet!  Price goes from $4.50 then everything else is an up charge, the icing, the toppings, sauces or drizzles, etc .. you end up paying about $8 (20% tip included) for a delicious cinna-bun a bit high yeah, totally worth it though!!"}
{"text":"You've got to be kidding me. Best cinnamon rolls in the world. Try the Oreo cookies and cream, coffee cake, chocolate chip cake batter, and smores cinnamon rolls"}
{"text":"I have a fatal allergy to dairy that I was born with so I'm a pretty hard critic when it comes to vegan food because my body will tell me weather or not the food has dairy in it pretty much immediately... So from my experience I can safely approve this to anyone who has an allergy to dairy because I ate 2 rolls and didn't die lol. Now for the taste part, I have literally never eaten something so amazingly delicious in my life. Yes it was that good, luckily I live in henderson so it's a far drive or I'd probably be there every day and end up on a TLC show in the future lol."}
{"text":"Naughtiness in a box, and they don't give a fork. Literally. Luckily I remembered to grab one on the way out.   I love this location. It's right across from my work, so I will be digging into these gooey delights again soon. I ordered the lemon raspberry cinnamon roll. It was about the diameter of a grapefruit and it was served hot.   The lemon icing tasted light and fresh. It wasn't overpowering. The fresh, slightly-mushy raspberries complemented the flavor nicely. I'm not sure if this was by design, but there was more icing in the box than on the roll. I ended up getting it in my hair and on my shirt as I tried to hit my mouth before it drizzled. No such luck!  As the roll cooled the cinnamon hardened into a texture almost like the brown sugar on a pineapple upside down cake. It's interesting to get two distinctly different experiences in one sitting. It was REALLY good. And it's vegan. I couldn't taste a difference.  Inside the seating area was a modern cafe style in black. Everything was super clean. I saw there were drinks to be had, like coffee, juice or water, but in my zeal I completely forgot. No worries. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Perhaps because I'm not vegan, but these are the worst cinnamon rolls I've ever tasted in my life.   I stopped in to purchase a dozen for our office.   The aroma was nauseating but I put that thought aside and wanted the proof to be in the actual product.   I work with a lot of high end foodies and not ONE of us liked anything about these \"cinnamon rolls\".    We all tossed them after two bites.  None of us will return.   Great concept but a completely disgusting product.    : (  CORRECTION:  THIS WAS THE CENTENNIAL LOCATION - NOT SUMMERLIN"}
{"text":"Probably the worst cinnamon rolls we've ever tasted.   I was so excited when they opened so I placed and order to take to our office (25 people).   Only one person of the 25 enjoyed the taste - they are Vegan.   Everyone else about gagged.  : (  Perhaps because they are Vegan and we are all accustomed to homemade old school yeast bread with butter - not margarine, eggs and good quality ingredients including the icing.   If we're going to indulge in a cinnamon roll, we want the real deal.   This is wonderful for Vegans and it is terrific Cinnaholic can be enjoyed by those with food intolerances etc."}
{"text":"So Cinnaholic was the last stop on food tour night with my cousin. It was both of our first time. I always wanted check CInnaholic out since close to my house and heard about it getting boast on Shark Tank. The whole concept gourmet cinnamon rolls?? It peaks interest. The only cinnamon rolls pops in my mind is Cinnabon or the ones get in roll in grocery store in a tube then lay them on cookie sheet pan to cook. I was excited check out the hype.   They have few different ones that can choose from all in a really awesome display all done up finish product. You also have the option that can make your own masterpiece. You just start the base with the cinnamon roll and the rest is whatever your heart desires. The smores really caught my eye. That the one I went with and my cousin went with made his own up. I forget what he came up with something with lemon flavor. Maybe. It was no way as artistic or had as much components then my smores. It was good. It had all the things associate with smores marshmallow, granola cracker, and chocolate. The only thing that was weird for me. The alcohol or if they do in the sauce on top was strong. I was thinking man getting drunk on cinnamon roll. The portion size is huge. Neither one of us were able to finish our cinnamon roll. I would almost say sharing is good idea if not super hungry. They also offer gluten free ones.  It small place not many seats. I am fan of the checkerboard old school dinner vibe get from the inside. You place order and then pick it up at the end of the counter. It open area so can watch your masterpiece come together. All the cinnamon rolls served in basket lines with checkerboard paper. The floor has that same look. Not sure if recall seeing fountain machine. They have refrigerator up front with lot of different options comes to bottle drinks from healthy ones coconut water, smart water, and more. They do have a widescreen in one corner of the restaurant. It might be little hard to find in the shopping center cause right in the middle. It located right across from Chuck E Cheese in the shopping center.  I enjoyed my Cinnaholic. Nothing that blew me away with the whole gourmet cinnamon roll. If have urge for cinnamon roll. One that not just soaked in all frosting and sugar more sugar. Gourmet or something different no doubt Cinnaholic is way to go!"}
{"text":"Came here on a friday night with a couple other people. Called in advance and was told they had enough of everything. 30 mins later we walk and are told they only have one cinnamon roll left. WTF!!! Complete WASTE of time. Asked the worker why she told us they had everything in stock, when they clearly didnt. She had no answer for us. Maybe they need to hire more competent workers. Obviously calling ahead time didnt work. I wont be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Wouldn't even know it was vegan if you told me.  On top of that, it's one of the best taking cinnamon rolls I've had."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a sweet treat. I got a tiramisu roll for a gift - that wasn't on the menu but I saw it on one of the Yelp pictures. They were able to make it even though it wasn't in the display case. I really appreciate the fast and friendly service . Everything is customizable.   My only warning is that they are addictive and there isn't a lot of seating available in store it's more of a grab and go place. I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Ran across this place on Yelp when looking for a place for cupcakes. My husband and daughter decided to make a trip while I was working, so I came home to a box of cinnamon rolls. I am not a big fan of these since normally my family likes Cinnabon. Little too sweet and too much cinnamon for me. Therefore, I was skeptical... and so, so wrong for doubting them! The best cinnamon rolls I've ever had in my life. They are vegan so no animal products. No egg. The Old Skool roll is fluffy, airy, has the perfect amount of spice, and the frosting is out of this world! You can make your own gourmet roll by choosing a frosting and toppings. The maple pecan pie roll is  calling my name from across the counter! I would recommend this place to anyone who loves cinnamon rolls or if you just have a sweet tooth craving."}
{"text":"Hey guys Vegan JackEL here.  I am just wanting to help people trying to see if this place is worth there first time. I've been there two times and both times the quality of the product was just not good. I love cinnomen buns, but the taste of these are not to my specific liking.   Just wanting to give you guys a heads up if trying to have a tasty treat."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for awhile. So happy I finally got to check it out. Live cinnamon rolls?? Then this is a definite must stop. How can anyone make cinnamon rolls even better? This place found a way.  Gourmet cinnamon rolls. Pick your flavor of frosting and toppings .. Viola!!! You have extra yummy goodness. Flavor of frostings include vanilla, chocolate, chai, peanut butter, caramel, pumpkin spice, etc. Toppings range from strawberries (fresh), blueberries, pretzels, coconut, chocolate chips, etc.   We ordered 6 so I figured it would take awhile but they were quick and the cinnamon rolls was fresh and hot. Super soft too! I had the chai frosting with strawberries. I will definitely go back!  They have baby rolls too for the little ones!"}
{"text":"Such a great idea! The cinnamon rolls are delicious and there are so many toppings to choose from to make you're own. A little pricey for a cinnamon roll however they are vegan and dairy free. Unfortunately, not soy free! My husband has a soy allergy and they use soy milk instead of regular milk for lactose allergies. I would have given them a 5 star but the attendant looked miserable both times I went there."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing! I am so glad there is another place to eat breakfast so close to my home. The cashiers were super friendly and helpful! For all my vegan/health nuts I highly recommend getting the frosting on the side. This place is all about the cinnamon rolls, so i also suggest bringing your favorite beverage with you. They do have fresh brewed coffee and water you can purchase."}
{"text":"Yummy, sweet, gooey goodness with so many flavors of icing for you cinnamon bun and lots and lots of icing....as it should be. So good."}
{"text":"Whoah be prepared for a sweet overload! They are great but maybe just too sweet for me! But if a sweet tooth is what you have these decadent babies will take care of that for sure! Staff sooo friendly!"}
{"text":"Ah.. the pains of a small business. They were pretty busy Friday morning when I went in. Only had two associates working. And about 8 customers lol. The cashier was new and actually doing a great job, she just needed help. I kept it basic and got one roll with cookie dough and another with cream cheese so it was quicker than others. I took mine to go, but another customer who was dining in had to go to the back and stop the chef from working to ask for eating utensils... and napkins.   I ate mine on the way. Very tasty and glad they're fresh baked. The combinations of tastes and flavors you can do are amazing, but I feel like the best part of any cinnamon roll is the middle. So save the best for last right? No. Double no. The middle has like 3 tablespoons of hard sugar and cinnamon. Seriously. I had to spit it out. I shoulda remembered to take a picture but I was on the road. And these aren't cheap! I expected more from them. I personally liked Salted Malted's Cinnamon Rolls better."}
{"text":"Cinnaholic is a Cinnamon Bun done RIGHT.   I tried a Captain America and a cookie flavored, and they were both great. Soft, gooey, delicious, and most of all photogenic! Next time I think I will just try their original though. It's like when I go to boba, if it is a new place I always judge them based on their plain milk tea with boba. Do the original justice and then I'll know you are legit!! Along this line, if I had one suggestion for them I wish they had more funky combo suggestions. Although a plain cinnamon bun is good enough for this classy lady, both members of my party griped about the lack of options. \"Make-Your-Own\" is fun but the business itself knows the best possible combos. Instead of only offering a few, have a menu of twenty combos and mark your best selling. This would be a huge help to first-timers!  Moving away from the food, I did not like the smell of this shop. It was like a mixture of soap and raw dough. I might have been hyper-aware of it because I was so looking forward to cinnamon and icing smell goodness. Who knows, maybe it was a bad day or they just completed a clean up, but it was actually bad enough to give me a slight headache. I couldn't eat there, so I took my gourmet bun home. The girls working the day I went did not want to be there. They seemed angry and distant. They struggled to put on a happy face but made an effort to be cordial which was appreciated.   Will come back for the bun, hope for employees in a better mood, and cross my fingers for delicious fresh baking smells. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Alright, going into this place I had no idea that it was Vegan.  It isn't really apparent on the menu at all.  Needless to say, I was apprehensive because how are you gonna make a cinnamon roll without butter??  I was so pleasantly surprised! I got an old skool with caramel frosting. It was amazing. Light and fluffy, the roll itself wasn't overly sweet. The frosting is a little grainy. Next time I would probably skip the frosting and opt for fruit topping. There will definitely be a next time though!"}
{"text":"We decided to come back a d ten again being they were a shark tank.  Cinnamon rolls look and taste fabulous with just a ton of different icings to choose from along with toppings.  The rolls themselves come out warmed and are delicious and put CinnaBon to shame.  Once the place finally opened it was packed.  Only real suggestion is open at 9am not 10am.  This my downgraded review."}
{"text":"Good not great.  Regular vanilla frosting was good, but I was expecting and exquisite roll for $5.00.  To me it tasted the same as any other roll, only thing makes it different is that it's vegan."}
{"text":"Wow! Delicious! A decadent treat for sure. To quote my son, \"this is like Cinnabon x 60!!!\" We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Woooow. Absolutely delicious. I have had several different cinnaholic buns and everything it is the most amazing flavor. They also delivery thru ubereats if you want to stay out of the heat and have it delivered!"}
{"text":"Omg soooooo yummy and I just found out it's  Dairy and lactose free, egg and cholesterol free. Idk how they do it..."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Cinnaholic before but assuming thrilled to find out that they offer vegan cinnamon rolls. I was even more thrilled when I found out just how many toppings and options they have. As soon as I found out, I told my friend we needed to go to the opening.   It was great to see how busy they were. I loved the Snapchat filter. I got the raspberry crumble and my friend got the chocolate cookie dough. Although he didn't share, I can say that it looked delicious. Mine was fabulous and went great with the coffee. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were headed to target when we saw the sign for cinnaholic. We were curious so we stopped in. At the time we weren't in the mood for a cinnamon roll but I loved the concept of \"building\" my own. So the next time we were in the mood for sweets, we tried it out. We thought they were absolutely amazing. A few weeks later we had friends in town and brunch at our house, we though this would make the perfect treat so we picked up a variety pack. We were l able to try different flavors and they were all amazing. Our friends are still talking about them!!! And side note, no one noticed or cared that they were Vegan so if you're worried about them tasting less tasty, don't!"}
{"text":"I came Into Cinnaholic yesterday, and what a experience!!! The two gentlemen behind the counter were awesome recommending me the Carmel Coffee Cake which was mouth watering and absolutely Delicious, I found my new favorite dessert spot, Thanks Shane & Marco for the recommendations and excellent service!!! I'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to say Cinnaholic blows Cinnabon out the water! Hands down the most amazing cinnamon roll I have had in my life, and I'm a local been here for 29 years! Staff was great! The Owners even work there too which is awesome!!! Great family environment and I would recommend this to any of my friends and family!  I will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"These cinnamon rolls are deliciously rich- you cannot tell they are vegan! The quality is much higher than places like Cinnabun and it's also better than making them from a tube at home. We've tried the classic style (cinnamon roll with just icing) and a few of the novelty styles displayed in the case. All have had a good cinnamon-roll-to-icing ratio, a fair amount of toppings, and have been large rolls. It is difficult to eat an entire roll with just one person; they are so rich that I do not recommend eating one alone! We love them and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I have to give 3 stars for their frosting, but I feel like they could be better. Maybe it's because it's 9pm and they close in a few hours.. the batch I tried probably wasn't fresh. I'm glad I tried it though, nothing to die for."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow..... this is cinibun on another level! Definitely coming back and trying all of the flavors!"}
{"text":"Too sweet for my taste and I typically love any thing sweet. I know it's a cinnamon roll but there was way too much of it in the center, I found myself drinking more water to get the sweet down. It didn't taste bad just not my cup of tea, I'll stick to pillsbury in the future."}
{"text":"My daughter gets an upset stomach when she's exposed to the smallest amounts of diary, so her diet is very limited. I was excited to read that Cinnaholic had vegan options! We bought two cinnarolls, the traditional and one with blueberries and strawberries on top. The icing tasted like real butter, the roll was served hot, and everything tasted amazing. Even though the food was great, the biggest test still remained...which was seeing if this food was going to upset my daughter's stomach. We have previously been places that  claim to be vegan and still make her ill! To my satisfaction,my daughter didn't have any reaction to the rolls! This is definitely a place I'll be using in the future. Even if you're not vegan, vegetarian, or suffering from diary allergies, this place is worth trying!"}
{"text":"Read the mixed reviews, and have to say FANTASTIC! We hard Time with deciding which type of cinnamon roll to pick:  there are so many to choose from so many mixes,will have to go back!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place over the weekend! When we got there we weren't even greeted by the lady that was working there, she acted like she was so overwhelmed by helping the little amount of people that were there. Finally when she did help us she wasn't very helpful and didn't explain anything. After ordering it was over 20$ for 3 cinnamon rolls and it took her over 15 minutes to get out order out. They tasted great but I hate going into a new place and not feeling welcome."}
{"text":"Love this spot for all the sweet treats. Vegan? No problem! Plenty of choices for you, too. Staff is super friendly and patient, in case you need help deciding. Store is always clean & plenty of space to enjoy your deliciousness."}
{"text":"My favorite is the amaretto cream with blackberries or Irish cream and strawberries! Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"What can I say about the best cinnamon roll on this earth. I would never guess they were vegan. My favorite topping is coffee, with chocolate chips. The little ones are just as great, as are the day old ones. 35 seconds in the microwave and I am in heaven!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing!!  i've been ordering off ubereats for the past two days trying different flavors, each one better than the last.  for the fact that they are vegan as well, great product.  highly recommend this place, not too sweet and flavor profiles are amazing."}
{"text":"Better than Cinnabon. The people who work here really care about their product and customers. My go to dessert spot"}
{"text":"Just wen today, got the cream cheese frosting with fresh strawberries on top, delicious!!! My only complaint is they don't open until 10am!!! I went this morning at 7:45am and was sad they open so late"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Beyond delicious! I had loss hope for delicious dessert after going vegan, but this place makes everything worth it. The cinnamon rolls are always warm and gooey. Always huge and they are very generous with the frosting! This is a weekly venture for my family and wish they would open one up closer to me! This is definitely the best location since I went to the flamingo one the other day and it was terrible! I was so disappointed, we will definitely only be going here from now on!"}
{"text":"If you're a sweet tooth and love varieties of sweet and combinations of sweets, this place has it. Their whole list looks so amazing and it's my first day here and I am so satisfied. I got the PB MUD PIE and it is SWEET AF but that's how I like it!! Great place great choices and can't wait to try everything on their menu!!!"}
{"text":"The best cinnamon rolls on the planet!!! So many flavor combinations to choose from that it was incredible!!!  The dough was so soft and delicious that you better come prepared to eat more that one or order a dozen!! I ordered some to take to family in Phoenix the next day. They travel well, just let them know if your traveling with them and they will put the toppings on the side.  This is definitely my new go to place!!! I am vegan, but my sister who's not loved every bite!!! Much better than anything you have ever had before.. just writing this is making me hungry for one!!!!"}
{"text":"These cinnamon rolls are incredibly good - whether you create your own or go with the standard option.  I've been there several times and the service and the quality remain very high.  I got one to consume there and one to go and they reheat just fine.  Don't plan on sharing!  Only wish is that they opened earlier."}
{"text":"As a local resident, I was pretty excited to try Cinnaholic. I stopped by on a Saturday night and no surprise the line was to the door. I thought that the checkout process was very nice. One of the workers walked through the line and took orders. I felt that this shortened the wait time. It was my first time, so it was a little hectic trying to decide on what to order. I decided to top my cinnamon roll with raspberry sauce and sprinkles. Payments are taken at one window on an IPad and then there's another window for order pickup. I thought that my order was pretty good. I plan on coming back to try other combinations. I didn't have a chance to fully check out the ambiance of the store but it seems pretty simple. The only downside was the bottled lemonade. I thought that the price was a little much. It was $2 for 10.5 Fl Oz. The taste was not appealing to me either. I had an overall great experience and would recommend others to try Cinnaholic!"}
{"text":"Open for 6 months now. This place is a gem. I can hardly believe that the food here is vegan. So many choices old school make something up it's all good. The staff is over the top helpful. Try the fluffernutter bun. Excellent!"}
{"text":"My second Cinnaholic experience & it was just as amazing as the one I had in SD! Seriously, I can't stop thinking about these delicious creations. Their cookie dough is absolute perfection. PLEASE COME TO ARIZONA!"}
{"text":"This is such a nice cinnamon roll place they are vegan and the frosting tastes so good. This is a nice place to get a quick sweet treat after a meal."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place and they did not disappoint! We got two rolls w/ cream cheeze & fruit - such a delicious and sweet way to start our day... We have reached sugar coma status - time for a nap!!  We will certainly be back! Love supporting small businesses especially ones with a vegan menu. Hope they are very successful!"}
{"text":"Nothing like an amazing fresh cinnamon roll right out of the oven. Plus your choice of frosting flavor and toppings. The possibilities are endless. To top it off the staff was just as warm as the rolls. Super helpful and friendly. Couldn't be more happy with the experience. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time trying cinnaholic , it was so good I made my own creation. I had cream cheese frosting with pecans and apples with caramel drizzle on top. So bomb! I still can't believe its vegan. The staff their is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"If I could give more than five stars I would. My boyfriend and I literally drove 30 minutes in the rain just to try these and they were well worth it. We got the original, cookie monster and blueberry pie (name could be wrong) flavors and they were insane. Hard to believe these are vegan and less than half the calories of normal cinnamon rolls. Staff was super friendly and helpful and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Gotta try the turtle cinnamon Way better than the other place  The warmness gives your taste buds an euphoric feeling"}
{"text":"When your daughter calls you at work just to ask where you got these delicious cookies and says they are the best she has ever had you know have a winner.  Then you get home and hubby is bummed cause all the cookies are gone.  Seriously one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've had.  I had the Groupon deal where you get 2 rolls, a cookie and a brownie.  We added on a couple more cookies and a few of the \"baked fresh yesterday\" rolls.  For the rolls we got cream cheese and cookie dough and peanut butter and Oreo.  Rolls were amazing.  Just as good as the OG Berkeley location.  I saved one for the next day and after a quick zap in the microwave tasted as good as the day before.  The trick is to resist eating them so they last until the next the morning.  Good luck with that."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Cinnaholics recently. The staff was really nice, there were lots of options to either create your own flavor or choose one from their display case if you wanted to try one of their creations. The toppings and cinnamon roll were delicious, however, after a few bites in, it was so sweet I had to stop. I would go back again, next time I would get just a plain cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"We went around 7 PM on Sunday and the place was packed with line wrapping in the store.  They do get things out quickly once you order - I think it took under 5 minutes to get ours. I had the hazelnut icing with \"oreos\" and pie crumble.  My husband had the peanut butter icing with strawberries and bananas.  We both thought they were good and we did not think they were too sweet.  My friend got the vanilla icing with cookie dough and chocolate drizzle and it was too sweet for her to finish eating.  I would suggest if getting the cookie dough maybe avoiding the vanilla icing as people seem to have been commenting it is too sweet. The cinnamon rolls were warm and gooey - I didn't find that they were dry as some have commented.  I'll definetely be back and look forward to the other proposed Charlotte openings."}
{"text":"I tried the baby cinnamon roll with cream cheese icing. The roll itself was pretty amazing but the cream cheese icing had an odd flavor to it. IMHO I think $1.75 is too much to pay for two bites of food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. Staff was friendly and service was quick. I had a chocolate chip, coconut and cookie dough cinnamon roll. Was out of this world! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was honestly feeling meh about a vegan cinnamon roll but, whoa! REALLY good. I had a roll with cream cheese frosting, caramel drizzle, and pecans. Yum! The only thing even sort of negative I can say is that the frosting was a bit sugar-gritty, but not really a problem.   Bottom line, I'm glad they do not have a location in my neighborhood. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Wait... What do you mean these are vegan? These cinnamon rolls are AMAZING, which makes it hard to believe that they are 100% vegan. But, it's true! Rest assured, all products at Cinnaholic are dairy and lactose-free, egg-free, and cholesterol-free.  I was beyond excited when I found out that a Cinnaholic was coming to the Pebble Marketplace. It's just what this shopping center needed!  My family and I came here for dessert after dinner at a nearby restaurant and although I was full, I couldn't resist this sweet treat. I love that Cinnaholic allows you to be creative. You can order an old fashioned cinnamon roll or you can live life on the edge and customize your own roll from start to finish! With almost 20 different frosting flavors and toppings, the combinations one could come up with are simply endless!  The cinnamon roll itself was delicious. Our rolls were fresh and warm! Not dry, not too gooey, just right. It had the perfect amount of frosting and it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.   Customer service was friendly and one of the employees even recommended a few of her favorite combinations! Can't wait to come back and create more cinnamon rolls!  P.S. Don't forget to register your phone number for their rewards program!"}
{"text":"These are so addictive, once you have one and taste that amazing fresh bun I am accepting that I'm going to gain 200 pounds over the next year and I'm ok with it"}
{"text":"What a great place! Exceeded my expectations by far!! Not your average cinnamon roll, They are amazing! Take one bite and you'll be hooked!! Simple, stylish, and trendy location with great and fast service! The menu is simple, easy to read, and is presented nicely! Oh and the manager shane is sucha hawt stud!!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place while having a sweet tooth and struggling to find a good desirable option as a Vegan. I yelped it and this place came up so I swing by. I was expecting to have only one vegan option, but to my surprise, the entire place is vegan!!!! I got a fresh one right out of the oven and went with the bananas foster route. Delicious!!!! I bought two vegan brownies to go as well as they look so good and are very soft. I will definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"This place hands down amazing for vegan cinnamon rolls. A little pricey but good for since and while snack. I do want to go back for the tub of cookie dough .. I am also excited for them to open one in Green Valley....  My family couldn't even tell they were vegan The cream cheese frosting was delicious"}
{"text":"If \"everything is vegan\" why is this not stated anywhere in this store? When I asked in disbelief I was irritatedly spoken to again, \"EVERYTHING IS VEGAN!\" 'Wow, cool if everything is Vegan then why isn't it shown in advertisement in this store?'   WE LOVE THIS PLACE.   Have you considered hiring friendly employees? Been here twice, two different people and yet same low vibrational energy.   Vegan is happy. Your cinnamon rolls rock, HAPPY SERVICE would be a great addition.   Thank you for making the yummiest cinnamon rolls ever."}
{"text":"Friendly people; smiley; ready to serve; and, indeed, fabulous, clean, healthy, multifruity, and mouth-watering cinnamon rolls and beverages!   Everybody MUST go there--Cinnaholic, on Tropical (across from Walmart & Sam's club) and taste for themselves!!  My wife and I LOVE the fresh, hot, and delicious rolls  Dr. Sarri NSHE Professor/Author"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot. I was in the area and remembered I had a free bun (or so I thought) so I stopped by. Well, apparently they changed their rewards program so I've got to sign up for the new one and start all over again. I think that's wrong. I earned my reward. I feel they should still honor it even though it's from their old rewards system. I didn't sign up for their new rewards program. Why would I do that? Needless to say, I'm in no hurry to go back. I will say their buns are excellent.  Update: I was contacted by Monica not long after my review. She asked for my name and address so she could give me my free bun. I told her I wasn't comfortable giving her my name and address. After that, I didn't hear back from her. I appreciate Monica attempting to make it right but I feel providing an email address or cell number should have been enough."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at Cinnaholic. Their cinnamon rolls are absolutely out of this world. I ordered the chocolate bomb cinnamon roll and I was surprised to see how packed with icing it was. They have a lot more varieties, but I wanted to try the chocolate bomb first. If you're in the market for some awesome cinnamon rolls, I recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a cinnamon roll and drink. I had an unfrosted roll to save calories, and it was soft and delicious. They offer many options for topping your roll if you want something really sinful.  Coffee was fresh and excellent. Cups and dishes are biodegradable which I appreciate. Nice place to take your plant based friends. I will go back"}
{"text":"Came in around 4pm on a Saturday and there were a lot of people in there, but no line. We got a Cookie Monster and then a custom strawberry icing & Oreo cookie topping cinnamon roll. Both were amazing & very fast friendly service.  The best part is that everything is VEGAN! Yay!"}
{"text":"I have made cinnamon rolls from scratch, and have had home made cinnamon rolls from various places that are really good.  Unfortunately, this was not up to par. The gimmick of a customized cinnamon roll is unusual to me, but I was willing to give it a shot. I had one with Nutella, and chocolate with Graham crackers and other goodies.   The end result is naturally a mess and leaves a lot to be desired. The cinnamon roll itself has very little flavor, and by itself I would imagine it being bland. Perhaps it's because the add these toppings they down play the cinnamon roll flavor?   I'm not sure, but for me, this was a big miss."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a cheat day.  I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon out of curiosity and it was a pretty good decision. Walking it, it was a little overwhelming trying to decide what to get but the lady on staff walked us through the menu. I opted the Twix cinnamon roll and my husband got a custom roll with Oreos on it. The staff is very friendly and the cinnamon rolls are so delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!! The guy who rang me up was extremely helpful and friendly! I didn't have to wait around for some one to come out from  the back to help me. As soon as I walked into the store, the guy came out from the back and was ready to take my order.   I ordered the old school, maple frosting, and the coffee frosting. Let me say this, if you do not have a sweet tooth, do not eat this because it's beyond sweet! All the flavored frosting that we got were subtle in taste, but extra sweet to where I couldn't enjoy eating it. The two out of three buns were drenched in the frosting to where I couldn't taste the cinnamon in the buns, which was a disappointment cause I love that cinnamon flavor!   I will give it another try sometime and ask for light frosting."}
{"text":"Most would think that a cinnamon roll is an average dessert, but not THESE cinnamon rolls. They are extremely good. You can customize your own cinnamon roll creation or you can pick a premade creation that they have. Last time I went I tried the PB&J roll. AMAZING.  These are no average cinnamon rolls. You can tell by the quality that these are made with love. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would stop by the restaurant today. It was a beautiful afternoon and we had some spare time while shopping. This was our first visit and it was very disappointing. We walked in and the place was empty. The cinnamon rolls were dry and unappealing. The lady behind the counter was not friendly at all. She said hello as if someone threatened her to speak. She walked away from us which was a sign she didn't want to help us. She didn't ask if we wanted anything or if we had any questions. So, I just walked out. In an empty restaurant, you should be warm and friendly when ANYONE walks in. I will spend my hard earned money someplace else."}
{"text":"Vegan Cinnamon Rolls, yes please !  I always want to support businesses that are using plant based options . These were not your average cinnamon rolls . You get to pick the type of frosting and you can add toppings , very gourmet . I tried the cream cheese frosting with raspberries . For me personally it was a little on the sweet side . I would probably just go plain next time . The quality is worth the price on these ."}
{"text":"I didn't even know these were Vegan before ordering! I ordered the apple pie and maple pecan based off the fact that this is a shop dedicated to cinnamon rolls...yum!! They were still warm and soft when delivered. Keep up this level of quality and this will be my new \"go to\" dessert! (Sorry about the pic quality...I'm not a photographer"}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about this place since it opened.  Since Cinnabon can only be purchased at the mall, I'm glad Cinnaholic opened a stand alone location near me.  Even though it's highly too sweet for me, we still go back.  My husband always gets a flavored one and I stick to the Old Skool version."}
{"text":"Cinnamon rolls are to die for and the toppings are fresh! Everything here tastes delicious. They didn't get 5 stars because they didn't have any milk for sale... they only had that soy stuff. I need my milk... I guess I'll just BYOM next time."}
{"text":"Didn't think I'd like Vegan desserts but I was definitely wrong. Their cinnamon roll desserts are just like Cinnabon but they don't feel as heavy or taste like pure sugar.   Marco and the rest of staff are very friendly and offer suggestions on what to get if you are undecided. From their Old Skool rolls to Banana Foster rolls to any custom roll you make, you can't go wrong.   Service is generally really quick, but if it gets busy it can take awhile to make all those cinnamon rolls. Went on their one year anniversary celebration day and it was packed. You can tell how many people love this place!"}
{"text":"The choices and combinations are endless! Last night I had the \"Elvis\". A cinnamon roll smothered and peanut butter frosting drizzled with chocolate and topped with sliced bananas. It was delicious. I am allergic to dairy so I love that everything is dairy free. You don't miss it in the flavor and I certainly don't miss the pain I get from consuming dairy!"}
{"text":"Cinnabon better pack their bags, there is a new king of cinnamon rolls! Don't miss this place for a delicious and gourmet version of your favorite classic treat. Also if you aren't a fan of the classic, don't fear, you can customize with flavors like cookie dough and cake batter! Fresh and warm, I chose the amaretto frosting with fresh blue berries and chopped pecans. After hoovering this delectable doughy indulgence I ordered 3 more to take home and share with the rest of the family. Who ever thought to take on an industry giant like Cinnabon was a brace soul and I will stand behind Cinnaholic as a loyal convert."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of sweets but I'm all about deez buns right here. It can be overwhelming seeing all the different options but let me make it easier for you, order the Cookie Monster! Once I tried it I no longer had the desire to branch out and try a different flavor, it's that good! They're even good the next day. Just pop that bun in the microwave and it'll be just as yummy as the day before."}
{"text":"Wow, hands down the best cinnamon roll I ever tasted and I don't say this lightly! I pride myself on being an expert taste tester when it comes to sweets! Come and try for yourself! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My newest obsession... I am not a vegan but a few of my friends are so I went with them but honestly, you could never taste the difference.  They don't advertise being vegan anywhere and nonvegans have no reason to feel threatened here like we sometimes are at other vegan restaurants and bakeries.  They certainly aren't shoving veganism down your throat.  They are also VERY reasonably priced which is not always the case with vegan restaurants or any bakeries. We came late at night so it was pretty quiet and calm.  We were lucky enough to get fresh rolls which was great but did take a while (NO complaints here but the woman who had ordered just after us seemed to be getting a little impatient).  I got the seasonal apple cider frosting with apple slices, pecans, oats, and cinnamon/sugar on top.  It was amazing other than being a little sweet for my taste.  This is the only reason I gave four stars.  Next time, I think I will try one of their smaller rolls (Baby Buns) so it isn't so overwhelming.  As you can see from some of the pictures, their regular sized rolls are HUGE and could probably feed two people. They are in a great neighborhood with a very clean store and store front.  The staff was super friendly and patient when I wasn't sure how to order.  I will definitely be back and am excited to have a go-to in some other cities!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Easy to order, friendly staff and clean. Tons of choices, I can't see going wrong with any flavor or topping."}
{"text":"This national chain specializes in custom vegan cinnamon rolls. You can create your own concoction based on over a dozen frosting flavors and nearly two dozen toppings. If you can't decide, choose from one of their preconceived flavor combos. I opted for the chocolate chip cheesecake. While I think it's great that they use ingredients that are completely devoid of animal products, I can't say I was a big fan of the roll I tried. It clearly has a different taste than non-vegan rolls, but did have a similar chewy texture. And, they get points for not skimping on the toppings. It was a massive portion overflowing with chocolate chips, graham cracker bits and strawberry sauce I added to it. You'll probably want to share."}
{"text":"This is the best cinnamon bun place ever. Almost as good as homemade cinnamon buns!  Plus I found out this place is vegan?!!?!? So me and my Bestfriend can go to one sweet place instead of two different ones!  I recommend this place to any and everyone I meet, it is bomb.com I have yet to hear a compliant from someone."}
{"text":"So we saw this on an episode of shark tank. Being interested in vegan friendly food and whatever the new healthier alternatives in eating are, we decided to give it a shot.  Came here on a late Wednesday night. It was close to closing time and it was pretty empty so the service was pretty quick and attentive. The menu is pretty broad. Multiple choices as far as flavors and toppings. Pretty overwhelming but they have something for everyone.  Decided to do just something traditional and got two cinnamon rolls with the icing. Remember, nothing here has dairy. So be forewarned. When we saw the episode of shark Tank we were kind of led to believe that you couldn't tell the difference between these vegan cinnamon rolls and a traditional cinnamon roll.  That's not the case. Yes, vegan is healthier. But you are sacrificing a lot of texture and flavor for something that is healthier and or more conscientious. The frosting was very thick and grainy. Not sure exactly why. The cinnamon rolls themselves were a bit on the driver side. Almost like they had been old but I was told this is how vegan cinnamon rolls are.  All in all a decent and clean place with friendly and attentive staff. But if you're looking for additional cinnamon roll, this is not the place to go. If you want something health-conscious then by all means give it a try especially if you're already vegan."}
{"text":"These cinnamon rolls are great. Great variety of specialties or you can build your own."}
{"text":"The cinnamon rolls were amazing! Did not taste vegan at all. I got cookie dough served on top and it was really good. The cookie dough did not taste vegan at all."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I don't understand people that have given this place a poor review. First off, if you're not vegan don't be discouraged to try Cinnaholic, you can't tell at all. People that claim to be able to tell the difference are mental. It's all in their head. These cinnamon rolls honestly taste better than 'normal' and the fact that they are cruelty free just makes them all the better."}
{"text":"Not good.   Why?  1) They are vegan.  Nothing wrong with that except this franchise makes ZERO effort to disclose it.  It's deceptive.  Intentionally.  Had no idea until I got home the cinnamon rolls were vegan.  That's not a cool way to do business.  2) They are pricey.  $5 is a little steep for a cinnamon roll.  3)  They don't taste good.  Bland.  Grainy frosting.  I threw 3/4 of it out.  It just wasn't very good.    I could find 10 places...in Henderson alone...that sell better tasting cinnamon rolls.  Would they be vegan?  No.  But that's not what I went into that store for.  Had they made any kind of reasonable effort to disclose what they sell I would have just chalked it up as a \"not my kind of place\" experience and moved on.  But because of the shady way they market their product I want people to be aware."}
{"text":"Loved that we stumbled upon this gem. Had a late lunch so after walking thru a couple of the local stores we decided on a little dessert. The young man was kind enough to cut our cinnamon roll in half and put in two different baskets. Just found out they are opening one closer to our house and can't wait."}
{"text":"The gourmet cinnamon rolls are amazing. So many different types to choose from. The ones I've had have been amazing. Friendly staff, chill atmosphere. If I could, I would eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. *Major Sweet tooth*"}
{"text":"Wow this place is so great!    I live 40 minutes away and will drive here daily to get my craving fixed.   For anyone who wants a different dessert place to go to go here!! Fast, amazing taste, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome dairy free cinnamon rolls, little too much frosting. My suggestion is order frosting on side and dip!! The lemon is so yummy. The employees are young and lack luster so far. Put some pep and friendliness in your step and rock selling your yummy cinnamon rolls!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! We went late at night and got the $1 cinnamon rolls and they were amazing!! Will definitely make a visit back."}
{"text":"Is this is Vegan I can go to heaven! Wow! My bun is perfectly cooked. The frosting is so amazing and so Delicious ok. Back to eating. Friendly service and amazing product!"}
{"text":"I'm really conflicted with how many stars to give this place because their cinnamon buns are so fluffy and good, but their frostings throw me off so bad.  I came in because I thought it was really cool that someone came up with the idea of customizable cinnamon buns so my friends and I decided to give it a try. Service is really nice and friendly and the place itself is very clean.  The only thing I didn't like were their frostings. And I honestly don't think I'd like any of their frostings besides vanilla, which is what originally comes on cinnamon buns. I got butterscotch but it was way too sweet. However, when I tried my friend's frostings, their's was also too sweet. They also drown your cinnamon bun in frosting like crazy. Make sure to sample before choosing your frosting!  Maybe one day I'll come back to this place if I'm craving some fresh cinnamon buns but will skip on frostings next time."}
{"text":"What's better than a fresh cinnamon roll...nothing! You can make so many different varieties which is very unique. Got the Apple crumble and cookies and cream today"}
{"text":"In searching for some vegan options while visiting Vegas for work, I saw the infamous Cinnaholic. Of course, I immediately knew I needed to stop by during my trip. I came in around 7 pm; there were a few people inside. It's not ridiculously cold in there like you assume it would be. There's a display with some options you can choose from but in speaking with the cashier, there are also other options. Since the idea of putting together my own frosting with toppings was a bit overwhelming I asked for some of the cashiers favorites. She mentioned tiramisu and the decision was immediately made. It's not your standard Cinnabon by any means, I could taste the coconut in the frosting. It was very tasty and worth every bite. I'll be back."}
{"text":"After a couple weeks of anticipation Cinnaholic Westlake is open! We ordered the Birthday Cake Bun, a plain bun and three orders of minis. All were AMAZING! These will be my go-to party favor or \"thinking of you\" gift.   The minis are the perfect size for kids - they're a couple bites each and are very manageable. My kids ate a couple each and had some of the bigger ones.   Service was awesome. For a brand new shop with a line out the door on the third day of business everyone was calm and collected. Also, the rewards program is sweet. Easy to sign up and earn rewards (no silly card to carry around).   Can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"I was a little sad that the cinnoman rolls werent fresh and they were too sweet for me. Biggest problem they dont offer free water. You make an overly sweet roll and charge me for a bottle of water, whats up with that???"}
{"text":"Well I made the mistake of going here yesterday and now I'm already planning my next visit. Complete decadence and friendly staff. I see a fattening but delicious habit in my future..."}
{"text":"Yayyyy for vegan yummys!!  Chocolate chip cookies are soooo good. Even day old Cinna buns taste fresh and delicious.  the frosting are so good and true to flavor.    My only complaint was about first impression and service. I was not greeted and when I told her it was first time and that I didn't know exactly how things worked she didn't say anything. I asked her for a recommendation and she said \"anything in the case is good\". She seemed very distracted and not interested in taking my order at all.   Such a great place and great products, amazing customer service would make this place so much better."}
{"text":"What a treat! I used 2 Groupons to first try Cinnaholic- 2 brownies, 2 cookies, and 4 rolls- now that is a good way to be introduced to this vegan bakery. There are so many combos of frostings and toppings that I was a little overwhelmed, but the employee was patient to answer my questions and give some suggestions.  Expect to wait a while for your order, especially if there is a crowd. I took mine to go because I knew that I would need to share my rolls and I am glad I did. At 650 calories not including toppings, I can't imagine having these rolls more than a few times a year. I would equate them to Pink Box donuts. Your mouth loves the taste, but you heart can't handle the ingredients. I would suggest less frosting to better appreciate the flavor of the toppings and roll. It was very messy so use a fork. I cut my 4 rolls in fourths and family members were able to try a sample. The brownie was very gooey- too much for my liking. The cookie was perfect-like something from my childhood. The store was clean and the employees were friendly. Parking can get crowded with all the other stores nearby so careful. Thankfully for my waistline I am only in this area for yoga class so that should keep my visits to Cinnaholic to a minimum but I would definitely bring out of town people here for the treats. Check their social media to see their seasonal flavors."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! My new favorite Cinnabon dessert! Love how it's vegan and still taste so good! Price is decent for the size of the Cinnabon and the amount of toppings they load on it.   We tried the original, banana cream pie and peanut butter cup! All were super good! I'd definitely eat them again. You can even build you own!  The 2 gals working were very helpful with helping us make our selection. The place is clean and they have a dine in area too!"}
{"text":"Myself and 4 friends were on vacation in Las Vegas, we live in Los Angeles, California, after having dinner in downtown on Friday night 3/17/2017, we were all super excited to try out your store (2 of my friends are vegan). We were finished with dinner at about 8:40pm and your store closed at 10:00pm, so before making the approximately 28 minute drive, one of my friends suggested we call to confirm you close at 10:00pm before we make the long drive, yelp is known to have incorrect store hours from time to time. I called and spoke with a female employee, I mentioned that we are driving from about 30 minutes out and wanted to confirm the store closed at 10:00pm and that it wouldn't be a problem that 5 of us would arrive by 9:15-9:20:pm, she replied \" Yes we close at 10:00pm and coming at that time would be fine as all our ingredients are made fresh so we have everything in stock, come on over we look forward to seeing you\", I replied Thank you and we were on our way. We arrived at the store at approximately 9:20pm, a car full of 5 of us, we walked into the store and the young man at the cashier said to us \"Just want to let you guys know we only have 1 roll left\", we were in complete shock and assumed he was joking with us but he went on to confirm that only one roll was left, I stated to him that we just called about 25 mins ago and your employee mentioned nothing about running out of rolls as even a possibility, he apologized and said there is nothing he can but offering for us to buy the single roll left. As you can expect after driving 30 minutes we were all pretty upset and disappointed especially after taking the initiative to call ahead of time to confirm, definitely affected the mood for the rest of the evening. The female employee who we spoke with on the phone, immediately went to the back room after she noticed we were complaining to the cashier and didn't even have the courtesy to come out and acknowledge her mistake and apologize to our group. I had to request the cashier to have her come out so I could question her why she would tell us one thing over the phone and then this happens, she apologized to me and then with an attitude stated \"Have a Goodnight\". This is by far one of the worst customer service experience I have dealt with, this is completely unacceptable, your management team needs to really do a better job of conveying to retail store location employees to alert customers who call in that due to a limited supply there is a possibility of rolls running out, I'm getting upset just having to take the time out of my busy day to write this letter to your company and live this disastrous night over again. I'm disappointed because was eager to try your Vegan Rolls but more disappointed for my 2 Vegan Friends who could not wait to try them as they were talking about visiting your location for the prior 2 days we in Las Vegas. I wrote a letter to the corporate office regarding our experience, the management team wrote back and stated they confirmed our story with the store location and employees, they stated they couldn't predict this would happen and only offered an apologize, an apology isn't sufficient here when your store dropped the ball BIG TIME. I gave them one more opportunity asking if they can make this situation right for me and my friends as an apology is just not acceptable in this case, the never responded again and here I am letting the yelp community know how this establishment treats and looks after its customer, don't waste your time driving here,  CAUTION STAY AWAY I would not recommend anyone come here and we definitely will NOT BE COMING BACK!"}
{"text":"Food 10/10 service 10/10 my 1yr old was freaking out because we were waiting for our fresh rolls and a very nice lady behind the counter gave her cookies to calm her down. I thought was nice and thoughtful of her."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite new sweet treat spots. Cinnamon rolls are always fresh, baked inside store. Toppings are always fresh especially fruit. Has a variety of frosting flavors. A little pricey for a cinnamon roll, yet it is all vegan! I'm not a vegan and haven't thought about it, but for all the vegans out there, definitely worth a drive."}
{"text":"The smell is what you notice first, so good.  The combination of roll, frosting and topping is the only that is hard about the place.  The staff can be very helpful on matching them up."}
{"text":"Classic roll with vanilla frosting was DIVINE. And it was vegan. Wtf. It was the perfect cinnamon roll.   I would be worried about exploring the menu a little. Girlfriend got a lemon frosting with blueberries and it was great but not a cinnamon roll like you would want.  Fantastic though!!!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of cinnamon rolls this place is great. I got 2 rolls the classic and the mud pie I think? Both were yummy I took them To-go so presentation isn't the nicest in the photo which really doesn't do them justice. I ate half of both rolls while they were fresh and then had the other half's later on in the day cold and both times were good."}
{"text":"I came here opening day with my little 8 year old mini... We came after dinner around 7:30 and the line wasn't too bad... But it was obvious they were packed earlier.   We were greeted promptly. the lady at the counter explained how to read the menu... (The menu is insane and I can't wait to go back and try everything). They have extensive frosting flavors... (Macadamia nut, coconut, lemon, gingerbread, chai, cream cheese... You get where I'm going with this)... And extensive toppings... (Oreos, raspberries, jam, strawberries, nuts, graham crackers, cookie dough.... Etc etc etc)... Pick the frosting and toppings and warm it up and you literally have perfection on a plate... Did I mention everything here is vegan?!? Yesssss!!! Everything!!!   We ordered the cream cheese cookie dough and the lemon with raspberry jam... Both were amazing... The lemon was superb! I had two bites of each and let my cousin take them home with her ( I would of finished them both that night). They offer coffee and have a cooler full of different drinks. They sell their 8oz cookie dough for only 5$!! And they have vegan chocolate chip cookies!!   I will definitely be returning to this wonderful gem... And when I do... Expect more photos and an updated review!"}
{"text":"Worth it. I had the original cinnamon roll and it was perfection. I couldn't even tell it was vegan. I also  had the mini cinnamon rolls with orange icing. Also very good but I prefer the larger rolls. I can't wait to come back and try the cookie dough."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine is vegan so it is slightly difficult to meet in the middle for good desserts. Luckily, Cinnaholic serves amazing vegan cinnamon rolls. Just entering envelops you in the addicting sweet smell and it's just so satisfying to say the least.  I also saw them on Shark Tank so I was anticipating the day they actually opened this shop.  The cinnamon rolls are huge and with the amount of frosting/toppings that they generously top it with, I can seriously share with another person. I can only eat half and save the rest for later.  I'm a sucker for their cream cheese frosting so I pick that with cookie dough, brownie bites, or blueberries on top.  I recently went to their free cinnamon roll event and the line was long! They ended up running out of cinnamon rolls. Just goes to show how great they are.   This location has plenty of seating and sometimes plays Bob's Burgers. I heard that they opened another location in Centennial and it sounds just as good as this one. I wish them more success in 2018 and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Really pricy starting at $5 a roll. Very disappointed, my grandkids hated it. And they are huge fans of Cinnabon  My grandson who loves everything sugary (he is 6 yrs old) scraped off the mound of vanilla after 2 bites, pushed it away!!  His little sister didn't eat hers after 1 bite either. The service wasn't great, and they weren't even busy the entire time we were there. Next time I spend $43 for a sweet treat with my grandkids I won't be coming here, Cinnabon is way better and not as $$$"}
{"text":"When you want something super sweet, this is the place . Everything I have tried so far is awesome. I recommend the s'mores one."}
{"text":"Vegan cinnamon rolls...yum!   I have been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it on Shark Tank and was so glad to hear they opened location in Vegas, since I visit here often.  I tried the pumpkin pie one and it tasted just a warm, gooey sweet pumpkin cinnamon roll! Very very sweet and I wouldn't eat one of these often but good to try.  I think I paid about $7 for it? But you can easily share."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place and left disappointed. The icing seems to taste a bit grainy... Maybe it's the lack of dairy due to it being vegan. Anyways, the cashier was friendly and let my sister and I try any flavor we wanted. I had amaretto and blueberries while she had blueberry pie or something like that. They were both okay.   I had bought a coffee along with my dessert and really disliked it after my first sip. I hesitated to ask for a refund for it, but it was just so distasteful. I kindly asked another man.. I think supervisor maybe? For a refund. He seemed annoyed that I would ask for such a thing, and actually LIED to me saying that he processed the refund. My sister is a little less shy than I am and asked why her e-receipt had not changed. He said \"oh let me check\" and all of a sudden she got a notification for a refund. What a JERK.  I will never be back, nor will I recommend this place to ANYONE."}
{"text":"All the Las Vegas vegans have been raving about this place..I know why. They take a fairly huge, fresh-baked cinnamon bun and you choose your icing, then your toppings.. they come to you hot, tender, sweet.. and you'll get your sugar fix ON!  It is probably a good thing I don't live too near to this place. I think I would be finding it excuse to stop by way too often."}
{"text":"I came to this place, much anticipating after hearing a buddy talk it up I was completely disappointed. The worthless worker at the front counter might've had something to do with it, but after eating this glorified \"Cinnabon\" I have to say there's nothing special about his place. Especially after paying $20 plus dollars on 3 buns. Save some money,  go next door and get some ice cream you'll be much more satisfied.  Note to manager: tell counter girl to find a new occupation, Jack in the box graveyard shift would be best suited for her. Dated June 27th 2018 6:00pm"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review about this place ever since my first visit here, but keeping up with Yelp can get crazy! lol  First off, this establishment is a great choice if you are craving for something REALLY SWEET. And I mean reeeaally sweet. Even though all orders are customizable, and you could ask for light frosting like I did, it's still crazy sweet! I would not recommend coming here if you're looking for a more light dessert, unless you'll be sharing with a group of people.  My fam and I ordered 3 different kinds. All with light frosting. They were made to order and all came out fresh, warm, and gooey. Reminds me of everyone's favorite mall eatery, Cinnabon. :] The interior space and seating is pretty limited, so coming here with a big group may not be accommodating.  All in all, this is the one-stop shop you should go to if you're craving for that soft, sugary, extra sweet, and melted frosting cinnamon roll of a dessert! Did I get your senses working? LOL"}
{"text":"If you love the Cinnabon stand at the mall, then you'll love  Cinnaholic. They took cinnamon rolls to a whole new level. Plus, who can say no to cinnamon and sugar?  From taste to quality, you gotta try this place out as a favor for your sweet tooth. Right when you enter you can smell the aroma of those cinnamon rolls. Everything is made to order and all orders are customizable. You can ask for light frosting as well.  I've written a review for both of their locations and customer service is great in both places. Never had any complaints about it or the food. Pricing is reasonable too.  What I like about this location compared to the one on the southwest side of town, is that it's a lot more spacious and it has plenty of tables and chairs throughout. It also makes it a great place to hang out when you're with a group of people.  In the same plaza you'll find Rolled Ice-Cream. Why not have both desserts if you're in the area? :]"}
{"text":"Just finished my first Cinnaholic masterpiece and I have to say I was completely blown away! I had every intention, when I walked into the store, to only eat half and save the rest for tomorrow. But, holy cow, it was too amazing to not finish!!! This will definitely be my go to place for a decadent treat. Don't even think of going to that cupcake place at Crocker Park, they can't even compare!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the free event they had going on. This is my second time visiting and the cinnamon buns are so big you can share them between two people. This place is amazing for desserts.  I had coffee frosting with chocolate chip and sprinkles. They expanded their hours until 11 at night! Definitely can see coming back since it's around the corner from us.  This event had people lined up at the door at 9 and wasn't going on until 10 pm.  We got in line at 9:45 pm and left an hour later with freshly baked desserts for free.  The line was wrapped around the building 15 minutes before close."}
{"text":"Omg first of all. Yummo! 2nd of all.. Vegan?   YAAS!!! I'm so trying to change my eating habits and I'm so happy that I can still have sweets that don't have dairy in it.  As we walked in, the guy behind the counter greeted us. Since it was our first time, he explained the menu to us.  I tried to find a frosting and toppings that weren't super sweet but of course it was. But a good thing. The portion size was a good size. I wasn't able to finish it and dessert & pastries are something that I always finish. Even sometimes before my main meal. Lol. I chose cream cheese frosting with almonds, bananas, and raspberry jam. I think I should of tried it with banana frosting & walnuts. That's my next pick. They also have almond milk to wash the cinnamon buns down. Thank goodness cuz dairy hates me."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend and we've never had such amazing cinnamon rolls. Tried the signature caramel roll and finished the entire thing, and I don't often finish desserts. Soft and fluffy cinnamon rolls and the toppings are fresh. These things are super delicious :)"}
{"text":"Sooo freaking amazing brought my fiancé here for his birthday breakfast and it was lovely"}
{"text":"Okay but a little pricey for a cinnamon roll and way to sweet for my taste it's been many years but i remember liking Cinnabon better"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious cinnamon rolls and customer service! I took away 1 star just because they are a bit pricey.   I like the fact that they are all vegan (dairy and egg free) so no upset tummies from anyone! Many options of already made flavors and make your own. We decided on s'mores and peanut butter cup. Both were fantastic in their own way, and even with the sweet add one, you could still enjoy the cinnamon roll taste. A nice treat!"}
{"text":"went in and had to try it since my husband loves cinnamon rolls. experience wasn't what I was expecting, one of the workers seemed to have an attitude while we were ordering but anyways. we got home and opened up the container and we were a bit disappointed, they looked like a hot mess...we couldn't even see the bun just pure frosting all over the container  but we began to eat them and it just felt like we were eating a mouth full of butter, frosting was very grainy and the bun was hard not fresh at all. Not sure if that's how they are suppose to be or if it was just our luck."}
{"text":"Omg.. this place is going to make me so fat!! Girl working the counter had no personality at all.. looked like she hated the place but it was good!"}
{"text":"Delicious and warm Cinnabon's! Got a traditional with bananas and strawberries was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is not Great ..  The people are kind of rude they really don't know how to greet I asked for a bag for my Cinnabon she ignore me walk the way I think they are very dry you are better off just buying them and making them on your own for 5 $ they r not worth it trust me . I won't in a bakery the wait it's ridiculous 10 minutes to get one Cinnabon.. 10$ really 1 a min not worth it"}
{"text":"Place was interesting...staff was nice but seemed depressed although their service was good. Plenty of options for sure! It was good, but maybe too sweet for me. So if you are looking to satisfy your sweet craving, this is the place."}
{"text":"I wondered what a vegan cinnamon roll would taste like so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm not at all impressed. I got the classic, I think they call it \"old skool,\" and the frosting is disgustingly sweet. I enjoy sweets but this is way too sweet. The dough is odd. I can't quite put my finger on it other than it has an odd flavor and a very doughy texture, almost as if it wasn't thoroughly cooked. The cinnamon roll left a film in my mouth after eating it and has made my stomach hurt. I'm   If you're aiming to have a healthy eating lifestyle, this is NOT the way to go - even if it is vegan. I understand splurging once in a while but with 730 calories, 600mg of sodium and 59g of sugar, I suggest splurging another way that tastes better. UPDATE: After the very passive aggressive reply by the manager of Cinnaholic, I definitely do NOT recommend this place. I refuse to give my business or a positive review to a place that employees such passive aggressive people. I have every right to post my thoughts and experiences about an establishment, after all that is what Yelp is all about. If Terri C. can't handle an honest review that doesn't support her establishment, then maybe it's best for her to get out of the food industry."}
{"text":"We just tried cinnaholic.  The cinnamon rolls were very yummy.  Lots of tasty cinnamon sugar inside!  Only downfall was they were not warm when served.  I prefer cream cheese frosting and should have asked for it.  My 17 year old son said his roll was \"pretty tasty\".  We liked it and recommend if you are a cinnamon roll fan to try this place!"}
{"text":"Cinnaholic is a vegan persons dream come true. Custom create your cinnamon roll with a huge variety of toppings and everything is vegan!! We found this place on yelp and we were not disappointed! The girls who worked in the front were awesome at explaining how everything worked and then we both ordered the classic cinnamon roll to go. After walking around Vegas and coming back to our suite it was amazing! To us it tasted just like a Cinnabon and you would never even know it was made without any animal products. Super gooey, cinnamony, doughy delightful yumminess. Go eat one or two, I won't judge you. I wish they had this place in Reno!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious cinnamon rolls. They are new, and located in a great spot in Centennial. Nice and clean, it's sure to be a staple within the community."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best rolls I have ever eaten. I was skeptical at first because it was vegan. Before all you vegans shoot daggers at me, let me explain...I am not vegan but my daughter is. Some of the food tastes different than what I am used to so I was afraid this would taste off. It tastes so much better than the non vegan rolls.  It was soft and moist on the inside and a little crispy on the outside. It was perfect, just the way I like it.  They make when you walk in so there is a little bit of a wait time but nothing major.  There is a variety of toppings to choose from and if you aren't sure what you want they will give you some ideas and even let you taste a sample. Both times I got the larger roll and I can barely finish it.  Not too sweet. If you aren't vegan, trust me when I say you can't even tell the difference. Customer service is spot on and never had any problems."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH.  I went to Cinnaholic today for their grand opening where they offered $1 cinnamon rolls (which normally retail around $5-6).    Forget everything you think you know about cinnamon rolls-- because these are nothing like anything you've ever had.  The concept is simple-- choose your cinnamon roll icing flavor and add toppings.  But the resulting dessert is incredible.  They offer a huge variety of icing flavors, from lemon to chai to hazelnut and everywhere in between.  The variety of toppings is just as diverse.  Fruit, chocolate chips, sprinkles, cookie dough, nuts, caramel sauce, jam, etc.  You name it, they probably have it.  I chose a chai flavored icing with pie crumble topping and I was so pleased with my choice.  The result was a huge ooey gooey melt in your mouth cinnamon roll with tons of flavor.  I can't wait to go back and try more flavors, particularly the fruitier flavors that aren't as typical for a cinnamon roll.    They also offered a huge \"cinnacake\", as well as cookies, cookie dough (by the scoop!!!), and Rising Star coffee.    Despite the huge line for their opening day, their staff was kind, courteous, and quick.  They even brought water outside to the patrons waiting in the hot sun.  The inside is a little small, but it was hard to get an accurate representation of just how small when it was packed to the brim for opening day.  They had several high-top tables, as well as some 2 top tables, so there is an option to sit inside and enjoy your treat.  I was very happy with my cinnamon roll and am so happy that I live so close.  They are open until 9pm most nights, so it is a great dessert alternative to ice cream and other nearby treats.  Do yourself a favor and go to Cinnaholic NOW!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST cinnamon rolls ever! My favorite is the Captain America and man it is so satisfying. The service was amazing and since they were about to close they offered me a Cookie Monster roll instead of throwing it out. That reassured me that they create fresh rolls. Best dessert ever and this location is my go to!"}
{"text":"I love the chargers and outlets at every table!   I've found I actually like the plain vanilla frosted cinnamon roll to be my favorite. At first I overloaded on all the amazing toppings."}
{"text":"Woohoo! First Review of the Henderson Cinnaholic Location!  I've heard really great things about this place: Cinnamon rolls that are vegan and come in an array of frostings and toppings. What's not to like?  My first cinnamon roll and I got a vanilla frosting with walnuts.  The cinnamon roll itself was alright but I've had better. I think it simply needs more cinnamon, however, complemented with the toppings, it brought a whole new flavor.  My overall assessment is that the appeal in this product is not the cinnamon roll itself but rather the array of toppings that can be put on the roll. I plan on coming back to try a new combination of ingredients."}
{"text":"literally there cinnamon buns are to die for  When I went there for the first time the customer service was excellent and also their buns were super fresh and warm.  Its definitely a great place to go."}
{"text":"I went to cinnaholic to get sweet treats for my staff! They were all amazing & we will definitely be back for more!! Yummm!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Inexperienced management....disappointing. Place was packed when it first opened, but sure  seems to have lost a lot of customers. Now empty each time I drive by. Nothing good to say."}
{"text":"This is one of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! The cookie dough mixed with the brownies mixed with the frosting... all blended together so well and made an incredible flavor! The cinnamon roll was nice and warm and just melted in my mouth. I will definitely be coming back for more. I don't know if that's a good thing, or a bad thing...  but I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"We were SO excited about trying this place out. We drove almost an hour for this special treat. It was super busy, but that was to be expected and not a big deal. We ordered 4 different cinnamon rolls and three of us ate them. Unfortunately... Two of them ended up in the trash and we managed to somewhat eat the others. We are plant based and used to eating things without dairy/animal products... So I wasn't expecting a miracle.. just a yummy treat.   The cream cheese frosting just has a funky taste, almost like fake banana? The brownies were hard and also thrown away :(. The almond frosting was... yuck!!! The best one out of the four was the maple Frosting with cookie dough and caramel. So so sad. If I had to do it again, I'd order a plain cinnamon roll. The middle of the rolls were fine and I did eat that part after I took the toppings off.  We also were charged for an extra cinnamon roll that we didn't order. Thankfully before we left and reviewed the receipt we were able to go back, and they said they credited our account. So again, not a big deal.  The place is super cute and the display case makes you want to order everything - but the taste test failed to impress.  Price: Base price was $4.75, to get a frosting is an additional $0.25, and each topping is $0.50."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great, friendly staff, delicious vegan monster buns, and decent coffee. I've been four times, and thought I'd finally write a review because it's an awesome place. This month my coworkers got me some for my birthday to go as a surprise, and they traveled well, too. So that's good to know."}
{"text":"For those that love a chance to customize one of history's most treasured desserts, now you can finally get it with Cinnaholic. They create delicious, allergy free cinnamon rolls with a wide variety of frostings and toppings. They even have a recipe book of interesting combinations that you can ascroll through for suggestions. I had a Fruit Pie which contained berries and pie crumble on top of a strawberry frosted roll. It is a great alternative if you want to try something aside from Cinnabon."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was surprised to find out these were vegan, dairy and cholesterol free.   I really liked the Captain America (cream cheese frosting, strawberries, blueberries), and the PB&J Crunchy (without the Jelly). It had a bunch of pecans on top.   I think the size of the roll is huge and it's a great tasting dessert when you're craving a freshly made, hot, cinnamon-y dessert. It is around $5 to start but for the amount you get, I think it's fair."}
{"text":"I had no idea cinnamon rolls could taste so good!!! Every roll I have had has been amazing!"}
{"text":"Well I have to say this establishment is AS ADVERTISED. I am starting my Las Vegas area VEGAN Food Excursion and this was stop #1. I mean if someone would have told me that Vegas would have such AWESOME VEGAN Options I would have called them crazy. Last year when we became Timeshare Owners out here we found such GEMS as The Pizza Kitchen....Ronald's Donuts.....Violette's Vegan.....and C.R.E.A.M. to name just a few. So when we made our plans this year the wife and I decided to hit several more VEGAN hot spots here and first on that list would be Cinnaholic. I decided to start with something simple.....roll with Vegan Cream Cheese......and Vegan Caramel......the RESULT = DELICIOUS. The wife had a roll with Vegan Cream Cheese and Pecans.....and did I mention by the way.....EVERYTHING.....and I do mean EVERYTHING on the MENU is VEGAN. This location is within walking distance of my timeshare property which is a huge plus but considering it was a Saturday and the place was packed we didn't know what to expect. Well I am pleased to say the customer service was excellent and while there was a wait because they make these rolls \"MADE TO ORDER\" style.....it was definitely worth it.  Two things to remember as I conclude this review.....they don't print paper receipts so remember to have them email it or text it to you. Secondly they have these awesome chargers for all different devices at each table so for those of you who just have to have your social media fix.....your covered. They have a great rewards program that I signed up for.....it took about 5 seconds. Why only 5 seconds you ask? Well you just put in your phone number and BOOM your in. You will receive a text message confirming your registration and your receive points on every transaction you make.....and all you have to do is enter your number every time you come in......no cards to carry or apps to download......AWESOME Right?   One last thing.....I promise....LOL.....We also had an awesome COOKIE for 2 Bucks.....and they sell mini buns....cinnacakes.....and even cookie dough for your sweet tooth pleasure.  Well I could go on and on.....but just get there quick.....fast.....and in a hurry and you will see what I am talking about. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously bad ass!  I love cinnamon rolls and this place has the most unique, great tasting, build your own gourmet cinnamon rolls you will ever have!  The rolls are cooked perfect, not burnt and are nice and chewy in the center. The cream cheese frosting was spectacular.  I also got a chocolate chip cookie which was also cooked to perfection; a little crisp around the edges and gooey on the inside. Nothing is worse than overcooked, hard baked goods. Cinnaholic knows what they are doing!"}
{"text":"This review is not based on the taste of the product. I'm sure that the rolls taste great. The store smells heavenly when you walk in. I will go back someday soon and actually try a roll. But I say that to say this. We were standing in line to order a couple of rolls on a Friday night and they were busy. Fair enough. You're busy creating delicious desserts for people but the person actually making the rolls was only wearing one glove. I'm ok with that. But when you're only wearing one glove and then get on all fours to get to go bags from under the register, YOU WASH YOUR DAMNED HANDS! You don't get up off the floor and go back to making and packing cinnamon rolls. Basic sanitary procedures are not being followed where all the customers can see? What's going on in the back? Seriously tighten this up."}
{"text":"So good but so bad for you. The calories are absolutely worth it I tell ya. Get a 6 pack to go and you won't regret it. Pricey but delish. Cinnaholic keep doing your thang mang!"}
{"text":"Didn't like having to wait 12 minutes for 2 plain cinnamon rolls. Would have been good to know that before I ordered and paid for it. should have some already made up! Staff was pleasant and I have not tasted them yet. Didn't like the rap music playing either. Good on Tuesday buy 1 get 1 free."}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of cinnamon rolls but I think I am now. These vegan treats will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth, I may not need any more sweets for another week. I got a custom cinnamon roll with strawberry icing and topped it with coconut, almonds and fresh strawberries.  The cinnamon roll was warm, fresh and soft like any $7 cinnamon roll should be. The icing didn't taste or look like strawberry icing but it was definitely delicious so I won't complain. I would definitely advise you to get a fresh fruit topping if you don't want a sweetness overload. The acidity of the fruit makes the flavor a lot more balanced and more pleasant to consume."}
{"text":"My coworker brought me one of these one day as a surprise and what a wonderful surprise it was! About $5 for a roll. It's large but that's still an entire meal at a sandwich place and some fast food establishments.   I am not Vegan. I will never be Vegan. I respect people who are Vegan and I am happy there is some more versatility out there for you. I do not understand why it needs to be punctuated that this place is Vegan. Personally, if there was a giant stamp on the door that stated \"Vegan\" I would likely be deterred. I think this is an awesome conversation starter and not a big deal. Try it!  As far as the cinnamon roll is concerned, frosting aside, absolutely perfect and 5 stars in my opinion. I am pretty boring and order the Old School Roll because I like it simple. But I've tried a few of the flavors and tried their cookie dough which is quite tasty.   For the frosting though, I have to agree with a lot of other people on some of the issues. One is that it is very sweet. You can taste that the sugar isn't dissolved and it gives it a grainy texture. The second concern is their fruit frostings. I've personally tried the blueberry and I was very disappointed. I knew something was wrong because it wasn't blue. The frosting was still the same white color. This means they use a flavoring. Why not use real fruit? I don't understand that AT ALL and therefore will not order the fruit frostings. They taste like chemicals and fake flavoring and it ruins the entire experience.   I think if they could create a way to make the frosting less sweet and make them more natural in flavoring, I would give this a five star review for sure. All that said, it is still a great place to try, Vegan or not."}
{"text":"This rating is based off UberEATS delivery.   Order was quick and delivered in a great amount of time. I ordered the cookies and cream, it was still warm and delicious when arriving too!! It was so good and it was large enough to share for sure! Would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"The store itself is pretty clean and the menu is straightforward. There's a display case right as you walk in that has some cinnamon rolls that are already made with some admittedly delicious sounding combinations (e.g. the pumpkin spice latte cinnamon roll for my inner basic b*tch).   Cashier was pretty friendly and gave me some suggestions as to what some of her favorite combinations were, and I ended up getting a amaretto almond roll. They do give out samples of the frosting on a wooden popsicle stick, which is pretty helpful.   No complains about service or friendliness, but at almost $6 a bun, it just wasn't really worth it for me. The cinnamon bun dough itself was not bad, but nothing to gush about, and the frosting was just way too sickly sweet for me. Maybe go easy on how sweet you make the icing?   Another suggestion would be to get better coffee! Anything that's sitting in one of those coffee thermoses all day just cannot be good."}
{"text":"The rolls are delicious with lots of options. Service is kind of like a fast food place which is why they get 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Am I missing something here? Maybe all the good reviews are because it's vegan?? I don't know haha! I didn't want to get a roll with a bunch of toppings. I just stuck to the good ole plain roll with vanilla icing. I always taste the roll my itself first and this was really terrible. Had absolutely no flavor and tasted like dough. I needed the icing to drown out the bland flavor of the roll, but even the icing wasn't great. So disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I loveeeee cinnamon rolls!  I decided to try this place out since it was so close to where I live.  I went into the location and it is set up like regular coffee shop minus the hipster decor.  The wait time was around maybe 10-15 mins because this place is still pretty new.  The staff was really nice, I ordered a classic old skool cinnamon roll, no brownies, fruit special type of frosting, just regular scmegular roll.  I have to say that it was pretty good.  Nothing super special about it, just a roll with vanilla frosting.  I would give it 5 stars, but its not the best roll i've had.  I think it is a good place to get a sweet snack if you are in the area.  I wouldn't drive an 1 hour like some reviews, but definitely if you are in the area stop by and get you a roll."}
{"text":"Cinnaholic is evil  they are so fresh and delicious you will be craving for them. Their cinnamon rolls are rich and decadent. Will definitely be back, but need to take a few extra spin classes first"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with coming here. We don't come here too often because it's almost a sin to do so. Just walking in and being enveloped by the smell of the cinnamon rolls is To. Die. For.   You can pick and chose the type of roll you want, the frosting, and the toppings. So get creative! There is an additional charge for more than one topping I believe, so I always stick to two. I do like the variety of it all.   They also have a rewards program where you insert your number and I guess it saves your information with the card you use. So that's a plus!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last night. Had the Bananas Foster weekly special. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and a great cinnamon roll. Was in with friends and Matty took our order. He was so friendly and took the time to explain everything. I'm not Vegan and use to rolls with all the fats and eggs and was wondering if I would even like it. I was very pleasantly surprised. The roll was warm light fluffy and delicious. I just did it old school with cream cheese frosting. I liked the frosting, not as thick as I was used to but definitely good. I definitely could give one to my son and if I didn't tell him it was vegan he wouldn't know the difference.  The coffee was really good too. Better than Starbucks. Exceptional service and delicious cinnamon rolls. It was my first time there and won't be my last. A little bit of a drive for me but well worth it hoping they'll put more around town soon"}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm hooked on this place now. I want to try all the combinations of icings and toppings!"}
{"text":"I love this place and it's close to my house!!!!. Although it's awesome I try to watch my girlish figure so I cant indulge as much as I want."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday for our first visit to Cinnaholic and Scott was working.  He couldn't of been friendlier! Awesome experience and customer service! The rolls were amazing as well, and everything is Vegan! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Vegan cinnamon rolls? You wouldn't even know! And that's intentional, because, let's be honest, if they advertised, they'd probably lose business. I'm not vegan, and while I have a major sweet-tooth, I would have never told you cinnamon rolls were something I craved. I don't crave foods. At least I didn't. Now just typing this review is making me want to grab my keys and drive to Cinnaholic.  Their employees are extremely friendly, they're fast, and the space is pretty nice if you want to eat in."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite cinnamon bun place in town. When i heard it was opening so close to me, I couldn't help but try it opening night. I've been here maybe 4 times and I've yet to be disappointed. Great service, quality food pand did i mention EVERYTHING IS VEGAN. Absolutely no need to worry. Marvin was especially helpful. Thank you for being so kind and personable. Extremely social and tending to any need we might have."}
{"text":"Super good vegan cinnamon rolls! I made one with banana cream, graham crackers, and pie crumble and it was so delicious! Wish they had a location in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what true love really was until I made love to this heavenly work of art with my mouth. Hands down best ever!"}
{"text":"Wish they were open earlier so I could grab one on the way to work. This place is irresistible and I've only been once. I will continue to come back now because of the nice service and amazing \"create your own\" cinnamon roll. Completely amazing.  The strawberries weren't old and gross, and the vanilla cream cheese that I chose was probably the best choice I made. I don't even like the cream cheese texture normally, but this was spectacular. I even scooped up the extra.  Probably the only cinnamon roll worth taking a picture of comes from this place. I've eaten cinnamon rolls all over Vegas because they are my favorite breakfast, and this place has perfected it. I really enjoyed my time there, even if it wasn't long at all. Hopefully one day, they'll offer packs of cinnamon rolls to go."}
{"text":"Cinnamon rolls were too sweet and overpriced. The service was mediocre. I expected a lot more for my first visit, but it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Vegan...cinnamon rolls.  VEGAN.  CINNAMON ROLLS. My first time trying this place was not this location, but somewhere in North vegas.  The options given to you are very interesting and you can customize it to your liking with nuts and fruit and different frostings.  They cost some quarters extra each, but it is well worth it.  My favorite combo so far is almonds, walnuts, and almond frosting.  Maybe next time I'll try cookie dough or cinnamon.  Oh and did I mention VEGAN CINNAMON ROLLS!?  Give it a shot on a cheat day or as a tasty alternative to your favorite frozen yogurt or ice cream place."}
{"text":"Overpriced and my cinnamon bun wasn't even warm and it was hard not soft. Don't recommend this for any type of dessert craving.. not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for when I just want to indulge in something sweet! I typically go for the old skool roll, which is completely, completely satisfying! The taste and texture and no different than a regular cinnamon roll. I dare to say even better than Cinnabon. Make sure you also try their chocolate chip cookies. Delicious!"}
{"text":"If I was going off of concept and the roll, I would give it a 5 stars but when customer service is bad, thats not okay.  My fiancé and I walked in today because I have heard nothing but amazing things about this place and the fact that its vegan made it even better.  When we walked in there was a little girl ( her daughter) jumping up and down on the counter. We weren't greeted when we walked in but the woman was counting the money drawer, totally understandable. But when she finished, we still were not greeted.  Thats not okay.  After standing there, I asked what all was in one of the pre made rolls, I barely could hear her answer.  When I asked her to repeat, she had an attitude and continued to respond.  If they were busy that would be one thing, but we were the only people in there.  Very disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Sometimes okay. Kids love to come here for the sweet sugar cinnamon rolls, but customer service is lacking. The teens behind the counter always seem to be bothered by paying customers."}
{"text":"This place is delish if you're looking for something extremely sweet & rich! Variety of frosting & toppings that you choose from to make it to your liking. Cinnamon roll was extremely soft, not dried up & large. Definitely only need 1 or even half of 1."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about coming here because in the past, most vegan things I've tried have tasted a bit chalky or had a weird texture to them. Not here though!   As a first timer, the menu can be overwhelming. There are just so many options. And while you can just go with a classic cinnamon roll, that seems to defeat the purpose. Regardless of what you order, though, it's going to be awesome.  These are absolutely decadent and delicious. I had the Twix cinnamon roll, and my husband ordered one with vanilla frosting, pecans, and caramel sauce. I'm glad it's a bit of a drive for me to get here, otherwise I would come a lot more. They are reasonably priced, so I wouldn't feel bad about it either!   I thought it was interesting that they don't seem to advertise that these are vegan. You don't really see it anywhere on the menu. I wouldn't have known unless I had read the Yelp reviews. As a nonvegan, I appreciated that they weren't all in your face about it.  The space is very clean and service was extremely quick. We came around 3:30 pm on a Monday and it was pretty empty, so if you want to beat the crowds, I'd recommend coming around then."}
{"text":"After seeing all of the great reviews on yelp for this place I was eager to give them a try. I noticed they had a Groupon, so I purchased one. The Groupon was good for 2 cinnamon rolls, 1 cookie and 1 brownie, which I liked because it meant I could get a taste of more than one item offered here at Cinnaholic. Employees were friendly and helpful with questions.   There are a couple of things about Cinnaholic that I was not aware of until after visiting this location:   The first... is that this place is 100% vegan. I don't have a whole lot of experience with eating vegan food, but if this is it when it comes to cinnamon rolls, just give me a damn Cinnabon from the mall instead. I understand some people eat vegan and I am glad there are options out there for all of our preferences. The baking sugars are derived from beets, their marshmallows are free of gelatin and other ingredients are all flavored with fruit, spices and plant derived oils according to Cinnaholic.   The second... is that they were on ABC's Shark Tank. They accepted a deal to ship their rolls nationwide, but then decided to decline the deal and focus on opening more storefronts.   So the cinnamon roll is $4.75 and if you add flavored frosting it's an additional $0.25 cents and an additional $0.50 for each topping. Ouch! That's about the same price (or more depending on how many toppings) as one Cinnabon at the mall or 2 Cinnabon inside Maverick. Yes, I know one is made vegan and the other isn't, but I'm wanting a tasty roll and not caring about beet sugars or cane sugars, just texture and taste matter to me. The cinnamon rolls I tried here had lemon frosting with fresh blueberries and chocolate frosting with Oreo cookies. The lemon frosting was really disappointing because the lemon flavor was very faint. I really loved the amount of blueberries they added and they tasted great. The chocolate with cookies was surprisingly good (hubby picked this one) however the rolls themselves were not great. They bake them in a toaster like oven and they come out fresh every 20 minutes, but after that long of a wait I expected a far better tasting cinnamon roll. I didn't care for the outer part of the roll it was kind of crispy and it was missing that super soft center most people crave from a cinnamon roll.   Brownie ($2.50) - The brownie didn't seem baked all the way, it was gooey and not in a good way. It was very oily.   Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2) - At first I thought the cookie appeared over baked, but decided to give it a try anyway. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised with how delicious this cookie was. Plenty of chocolate chips in every bite and it was soft and chew, not over baked at all.   They are opening up a Cinnaholic location on my side of town, so I am up for giving them a try at some point. They currently do not offer any gluten free items."}
{"text":"Who doesn't have a weakness for sweetness?? So glad this location opened up close to my house! I'll definitely be a frequent customer. Try the smores cinnamon roll...its killer!!"}
{"text":"Heavenly cinnamon rolls, definitely shareable size. You wouldn't know they are vegan so don't let that scare you! I only wish they were open early on weekends so we could actually have them for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The whole store is so fun and cute! The buns are amazing and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic cinnamon rolls!! Amaretto frosting with walnuts topping was incredible!! It wasn't too sweet or too over powering in flavor! It was PERFECT!! Can't wait to go back and try all the flavors!!"}
{"text":"Love  this place best Cinnamon Rolls om town. Yummy! Great place for a sweet treat . You must try this place ! Don't miss out !I am going back for sure."}
{"text":"Went in around 9pm they were out of the baby buns. We ordered butter pecan with walnut toppings. A lemon icing with pecan topping. It was okay. I was worried I wasn't going to like it because it was all vegan but it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"The best cinnamon rolls ever- not to mention VEGAN!!!  First, I just want to say I'm someone who hates driving and cinnaholic is just about on the opposite end of my part of town- but yet, I still make the trip for these amazing cinnamon rolls!   Cinnaholic offers a ready to pick menu or build your own options. If you choose to build your own you start with your option of roll and work up to all your toppings. The roll itself is $4.75, frosting is 25 cents, and each topping is 50 cents. They offer such a variety of frosting from your typical Vanilla to Amaretto and banana cream!   We had a Twix roll- off the set menu, and a build your own topped with cookie dough, brownie, and chocolate drizzle. Both were equally as delicious!   I cannot wait for the new location to open in Henderson, definitely will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Whoa. Here you have it folks; ultimate cheat day food.  I only ordered one bun to share, which was perfect.  There's such a great selection of frosting flavors, that I almost wish they offered a set of 3 mini buns to customize differently.  This option is doable, but might end up pricey.  As for my first and only cinnamon roll, I got the coffee icing with oreos and pie crumble.  Though it looks like the bun is drowning in the frosting (not usually my cup of tea), it is pretty darn good.  It's served to you hot - gosh I'm drooling thinking about it.    Unfortunately, the drink menu isn't as appealing as the frosting and toppings menu.  While this snack is a definite treat, it is a much earned one at its price point.  Also, I feel like the experience needs to be vamped up a bit.  We were greeted when we walked in, but there wasn't much more interaction after that considering there were about 4 employees behind the glass and 2 of us in the entire store.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for but at nearly $7 for a gourmet cinnamon roll, I'd expect a gourmet level experience.  To be honest, I didn't even know this place was vegan until I came over to Yelp to review it!  That should've been something to be proud of, and I wish I knew coming in."}
{"text":"This place? Oh, just the most Amazing Cinnamon Rolls Ever!!! Have been fans of the location out on the south side, and so happy they have one down the street from our house now!!!  The place is new, clean, spaceous. The staff are very nice and friendly. And of course the cinnamon rolls are fantastically delicious! The dough is thick but soft, frosting (Banana Cream is my favorite!) is sweet, creamy and just perfect consistency (not too heavy not too light).  Try the Banana Foster Cinnamon Roll, it's my husband's favorite, and is quite amazingly delicious!  The only down side is... These are not 0 calorie treats... Or I'd be here every day. ;p  Oh and a little secret, they are all vegan!!! Now you can get a \"feel good\" for the environment and animals with your cinnamon roll addiction. Good enough excuse for me."}
{"text":"I normally love this place but the girl who waited on me was super chatty with the people who ordered after me so I don't think she was paying attention to what she was doing with my order.  I ordered cookie dough and marshmallows and ended up with tons of cookie dough (very gooey) and only 3 marshmallows (I counted).  Very disappointed in this:("}
{"text":"The bun was really delicious,  I just wish they could ask how much icing you want, because was swimming!!! It just was just way too sweet!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon.  There were two other customers in front of me.  As I was waiting to place my order I see the cashier has about five to six of the styrofoam containers that the cinnamon roll would go into open face down on the counter in front of him.  He's not wearing gloves and he's taking orders and writing them on the back of the box, which mean he is also handling payment at the same time.  Seems efficient but highly unsanitary.  As a customer how do I know how often the counter is wiped down, and I just don't like the idea of  knowing my cinnamon roll is going to be placed into the box the cashier touched and wrote my order on.  And honestly if this is the practice taking place where customers can see it what am I not seeing.  I walked out without ordering."}
{"text":"This place was SO delicious...and vegan too!! I got the choc chip cheesecake cinnamon roll and my friend got the  cookies and cream-both so good. They have options where you can build your own. They also have brownies, cookies and edible cookie dough. YUM! I recommend checking this one out, Vegan or not."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try Cinnaholic forever so I was overjoyed when I heard one opened in Vegas! I checked it out not too long ago & wasn't disappointed. We tried the Cookie Monster & Smores which were suggested in the display. You can also do as you go & pick your own frosting so toppings if you prefer a specific topping which they have tons of options!!! I would get the Cookie Monster again but I hope to try making my own combo next time. Def a lot of sugar so I personally could have just shared one. It took my mother &  I two days to finish both because we couldn't eat a whole one by ourselves since they were so loaded & sweet. Love that they are all vegan so you don't have to worry about checking or asking about ingredients with animal products. Also the ladies working there were super friendly & outgoing which is hard to find. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. It is rather pricey for what your getting. Maybe I'll try again some other time"}
{"text":"Accidentally stumbled upon this place with my boo when we were on the way to Target. We just saw a giant sign that said gourmet cinnamon rolls and we were sold already. You can customize your cinnamon rolls or choose from their specials, which we did. I got the coconut cream pie and he got the peanut butter jelly crunch. Both were really good. The prices were a little expensive for a cinnamon roll but I think they're decent considering that they use vegan ingredients."}
{"text":"FIVE STARS FIVE STARS FIVE STARS!!!! OMG... if you are vegan or not, come here right now!  This place is absolutely stinking epic! I have to tell you I've had some really bad cinnamon buns, cinnamon rolls, cinnamon things... In my time! This place is so good!! everything is amazing! I ended up leaving with five buns and one set of mini buns because the first one I got was so good! The frosting is perfect the cinnamon rolls are soft and not stale or crusty!   This place is nestled in with a bunch of different shops so the parking here can be a bit of a challenge... But I promise you it's totally worth it! This place is very small but the owners have done a great job and segmenting out where you wait in line and where you eat your food... See you never feel like you're being crammed in there.  I will definitely come back here again and again. Don't forget to join up for their loyalty rewards program... You have the opportunity to get some free buns!!   Loving this new found treasure :)  - WAY TO GO GUYS!"}
{"text":"Super fun idea. My kids loved designing crazy flavors of cinnamon rolls. The rolls themselves are definitely solid. Per my taste, the frosting and toppings are a bit over the top on the sweetness level. I would overall just prefer a plain cinnamon roll, but that is just personal taste. Our favorite flavor was the Captain America (fresh strawberries and blueberries with vanilla frosting I think).   Definitely a fun place to go with kids or a fun date night!"}
{"text":"My husband brought these home and I was upset and excited at the same time. Knowing the damage these can do to your daily caloric intake is worrisome. However I decided to Indulge in a big bite. To my surprise I didn't Really love it. The frosting is too buttery tasting for my liking. I love icing but this was almost like eating soft butter With sugar mixed in. The bun itself was pretty good and reheated nicely but I look forward to good frosting. I wouldn't buy again:("}
{"text":"I step in here after having lunch at the hotdog place next to it. In my opinion they don't worth the price. They're not terrible but I have tried better. I tried their blueberry pie roll, and nothing special; the glaze was runny cause they served it over a very hot bun, the bun itself is blend, and the other toppings didn't add anything to it. I paid $6.75 + tip for this roll, way too much for a roll. My hot dog for lunch was $5.50. It just doesn't make sense to me that desert costs more than food, specially for that size and quality.  I have no idea they were vegan, maybe that's the reason why I felt they were missing flavor. Still too pricey to satisfy a vegan tooth."}
{"text":"Hands down, the most amazing cinnamon rolls ever!!! They are so creative with all the different flavors and toppings too. Looking forward to trying it all. The customer service was really great too! It was my first time and they were so helpful, friendly, and patient as it was tough to decide since everything looked so good!"}
{"text":"This is a WONDERFUL new shoppe in Las Vegas that serves vegan cinnamon buns with FROSTING and TOPPINGS of YOUR CHOICE!!! Beautiful, clean and DELISH!!! This will be a regular stop in my routine from now on..(hint: try the PB n Banana or the Raspberry w Cream Cheese Frosting!) These are DEFINITELY TO DIE 4!!!"}
{"text":"What a WELCOME ADDITION to the NEIGHBORHOOD!!! Cinnaholic just opened this past Friday, 4/7/17, and I'm THRILLED they're here!!! Totally VEGAN and WARM and DELICIOUS, Cinnaholic does Cinnamon Rolls, Cookies, Brownies, Cookie Dough and more, without any animal products! I treated myself to the Bananas Foster (too many frosting and topping choices to enumerate here!) and found myself in Vegan Heaven, so, do yourself a favor and splurge (in a healthier way) on a trip to the NEW Cinnaholic on Tropical Pkwy.. You will be so happy you did!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh my!  I hadn't heard about this place before.  If you love fresh baked cinnamon rolls, topped with anything you want on it, this is the place!!  My favorite... Bananas Foster!"}
{"text":"Cinnaholic is a blessing. Everything here is delicious and vegan! The cookies, brownies, all of the cinnamon roll combos. Incredible! I can't even explain how much I love this place.   Pro tip: order the cookie dough and eat it with a spoon. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great concept but don't expect fast service...most of the time I go in and they don't even have any cinnamon buns made so it's a good 20-30 wait. On this occasion I order a large cinnacake for a pickup time of 10:30am...well it's 11:09 as I'm still sitting here and writing this review and they still haven't finished putting the toppings on. Needless to say they have no concept of pickup times and I'm now late for work. But on the upside these are totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm a stickler for clean food joints.  I gave this place a one star mainly because of unsanitary habits, like not switching out plastic gloves or washing hands before food prep after directly handling money and emptying boxes of supplies. Gross! The glass doors and cash register where you have to sign with your finger was also slimy with fingerprints. Because of that I actually walked out without trying the buns, even though I paid for them (about $10)."}
{"text":"I am a huge Cinnabun fan, I heard about Cinnaholic from my cousin.  He went there and loved it. It is vegan and so many different types you can make.  It is even healthy and I would recommend it to everyone. That staff was very nice and welcoming. Great prices as well."}
{"text":"Best sweet tooth fix ever! You could get away with these for breakfast or dessert. It's like subway for cinnamon rolls. They have tons of tops all made in house and really you can't go wrong with any of them. And don't let this turn you away but not only are they amazing they just happen to be vegan and I promise you won't even notice a taste difference. Did I mention they have safe edible cookie dough? Because they do and it's amazing. If you can't handle a full size one they also have minis that you can do custom toppings. I tried the fudge ribbon cookie, a chocolate topping, and almond mocha with cookie dough!"}
{"text":"I've gotta go one more time at least before i give them the last star lol the one time i went it was soooo god!!! 2 good visits in a row and you'll get 5 stars from me!!!"}
{"text":"Here, you will find fluffy and homemade cinnamon rolls. You get more bread here than other places and I would always prefer it over Cinnabon since they homemake their rolls. The reason I give this place a 4 is purely due to the cloying sweetness of the glaze and the artificial flavoring on some of the flavored icings. I always just get the regular glaze and I can never eat it all. Their cookie dough add on is really good just on it's own.   If you happen to get lucky and come on a day where they have the banana bread available, you're in for a treat! Their banana bread is delish!!"}
{"text":"Ugh I wish this place wasn't so good!!!  Their cinnamon rolls are AMAZING!!!!  My favorite one is the Elvis..hands down!  Ive tried a few others and they are great too but for now I'm sticking with the Elvis!"}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic!! I went in and saw all the delicious rolls on display - I wanted all of them. I needed help deciding and the two wonderful guys working behind the counter recommended the cookies and cream cinnamon bun. Oh my god, was that thing delicious! The oreos and chocolate chips were such a great combo. If you're looking for a place to satiate your sweet tooth, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite vegan sweet spots  They are amazing. You get to be creative and make up your own flavors. They have tons to choose from. Along with cookies, brownies and cookie doughs! Definitely a must if you're looking for delicious amazing sweet treats that just  just so happen to be vegan goodness."}
{"text":"There food here is beyond good! The quality is remarkable. Cinnaholic is a great desert place especially being a new addition to the Centennial area. The only thing I would give feedback on is their process of handling their supply of rolls. Even though they close at 10 you have to make this assumption that they might run out before hand. So advice for those who are trying to get here right before close. I highly recommend you call ahead or get their early to place yourself before that last batch rolls out!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I got 4 mini cinnabuns w/ different frostings & my daughter got a choc chip cookie. All were delicious, especially the cream cheese & strawberry frostings. The cashier was friendly, helpful & attentive. I really appreciated being able to sample the flavors."}
{"text":"Hands down the best dessert spot in Nevada. The cinnamon rolls are absolutely incredible and the flavor choices and toppings are out of this world. Definitely a must try!!! After having it once, you'll fall in love. I love that it's vegan and breaks the stereotype that all vegan food/desserts are \"gross\". This place proved the veganism does not mean lack of flavor!!! Love love love this place and will be back for sure!! Also, the staff is absolutely incredible and Marco is great!!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! so love this place. Too many desicions. That's why I have been back so many times. Also enjoy the atmosphere and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Dessert for breakfast is always a good idea.   Cinnaholic serves cinnamon buns with a twist.  Essentially, you can create your own cinnamon roll with whatever icing and topping you want. Their ooey-gooey buns will leave your sweet tooth wanting more.   How To:  Order at the counter Personalize your roll Pick your icing Pick your topping(s)  Grab your personalized roll and stuff your face    Food: Don't know what to order? Pick an established combo.  I ordered their Blueberry Pie.  It was dreamy! My roll was covered in a generous layer of vanilla frosting Toppings included a handful of blueberries with a layer of sugar/cinnamon and oat crumble The roll was large, filling, soft, and super sweet.  Yum, yum, and more yum. These delicious buns will be swimming circles around your cinnaholic heart.   Overall: I enjoyed my cinnaholic bun and will definitely be back to sample other flavors.  Hot Tip:  They have cinnamon bun cakes!  Grab a cinnacake here for your next birthday  (they require a 24 hr notice)   Review 3 for 2017"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This is the best & only vegan cinnamon roll I've ever had! I had mine with almond frosting & raspberries, blueberries, bananas & pie crust on top. It was so nice, warm & delicious! My son got one with tiramisu frosting & cookie dough. I thought his was too sweet but he loved it.  Fast & organized ordering process but the wait is long to obtain it. Sometimes you gotta sacrifice time for greatness cause it sure taste great that's for sure. I'm craving for another so we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very good, freshly baked vegan cinnamon rolls. I will return... Cinnamon needs to be more, hardly any cinnamon so make sure you tell them extra cinnamon inside the roll. Otherwise I would have given them five stars. Next time I will ask them to put more cinnamon inside."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place!! Their cinnamon rolls are delicious and everyone there are extremely friendly and kind."}
{"text":"You will never believe these decadent buns are vegan! I got a bunch of regular, one pumpkin pie, one triple raspberry. I think I prefer the original! The girl working kind of confused me + the whole set up seemed a bit over complicated but the product themselves is just to die for."}
{"text":"Went at 8:30 at night, the only had one Cinnabon left, employees were rude and had attitudes. Cinnabon overall was way to overloaded with frosting. Not so great"}
{"text":"Seriously the best cinnamon rolls I've had! I have a major sweet tooth and this did not disappoint. They were ooey and gooey and best of all-vegan!!! You cannot beat this place. I can't wait to go back and take all my friends"}
{"text":"Very surprised to say I think these blow Cinnabon out of the water. They're huge, made fresh and customized will all your favorite toppings...I mean, what's not to love??! The first step is picking your own ICING, come on now!! Think there were about fifteen flavors. We went with a cream cheese and banana cream...yum. Second step is selecting as many wonderful toppings your little heart desires: cookie dough, sauces, pretzels, fresh fruits...it's ridic   They have other items as well; brownies, cookies. We also tried the edible cookie dough with s'mores topping. Was overly sweet for me personally, but I just housed the CR and saved this one for my husband.   They're advertised as gourmet CRs which is spot on and they're also vegan (I would've never know). The CRs are pricey at $4.75 + $.50 per topping, but 100% worth it. Basically licked my container clean and I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm in Ohio for the weekend and we were looking for Vegan desserts and found Cinnaholic.  It is appropriately named because once you eat one of these your tongue will slap your brain!!  Then you're hooked.  So, I'm a Cinnabon fan and now I can say I WAS a Cinnabon fan. This place bakes their cinnamon rolls fresh daily and you can choose your toppings and not have to worry about dairy, meat, etc. because it is all vegan! And you carnivores will love it as well! Please come and build one in Northern Virginia!!"}
{"text":"This is the Best Creation a spin off  of the Classic Cinnabon( gone wild . ) A Vegan treat with custom toppings making this one of our fav stops . Addictive as you cannot just have one . The place & restrooms are clean . The Atmosphere is chill nice music & friendly customer service .A True 5  Star experience"}
{"text":"Move over Cinnabon.... Cinnaholic is the new Cinnamon Roll place in town. I decided to try this place out based on the reviews of other Yelpers.  Upon entering this delicious store, your greeted by a group of friendly and helpful employees. They explained the concept of customizing your own cinnamon roll with your choice of frosting and toppings. Pricing per roll depended how much you put on your roll. I was overwhelmed with selection that they offered. However one of their employee suggested that I try out one of their specialty that are displayed in the pastry case. At that moment, my mind told me to get All but I ended up with a Pumpkin Pecan flavored cinnamon roll. Judging by the ones that were displayed it was more than enough for one person to consume but it depends how big of a sweet tooth you have. I initially wanted mine to go but with all the sweet aromatic scent in the store I decide to eat mine like a Heffer!  Actually, I grab a seat toward the back counter where you pick up your delicious roll and got a few essentials like a fork and napkins to savor my cinnamon roll. From the very first bite to the last bite was simply delicious and couldn't believe that I was enjoying a Vegan gourmet style cinnamon roll. The roll was soft throughout and wasn't dry with a hint of crispy texture that was perfectly balanced with the sweet frosting. FYI-If your not much of a frosting person you can adjust the amount you would like. I definitely will be back to try so more out and create my own!"}
{"text":"This locations wasn't helpful because I told them I was a newbie. They didn't tell me if I could try the frosting flavor or didn't tell me about how I can pick my order. The lady wasn't helpful. She just look at me and didn't help at all. I would give this place a 3 out of 5. The bread was good but the frosting wasn't all great. It didn't taste like lemon"}
{"text":"Cinnaholic in Hendo... AWESOME! Very clean and great service. Had the old skool original cinnabon with a Jarritos \"real sugar\" mandarin soda... the best!"}
{"text":"Wish it were closer to my home and the to-go containers weren't ridged on the bottom as it made licking all the gooey frosting goodness more difficult. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great cinnamon rolls!  The \"frostings\" and toppings are ridiculous...in a good way.  The variety is overwhelming.  They bake them fresh for you so they are warm, gooey and delicious.  With or without the frosting/toppings they are wonderful.  The customer service is exemplary.  They went above and beyond to accommodate my order.  This place is a win-win!  I will definitely return for another cinnamony delight!"}
{"text":"Be careful their specialty items are expensive BUT everything is great. Someone who insisted that Vegan food was tasteless or horrible tasting had one and said it was good then I told him it was Vegan and he couldn't believe it."}
{"text":"Loving these little buns! My son brought some home on their grand opening, and I was hooked. Creative flavors, and I love the ability to customize my order. Icing flavors are amazing, and I think I've tried them all at this point. The minis are just the perfect size treat."}
{"text":"OMG, where has Cinnaholic been all my life?!?!!!! Like this is such a game-changer. Bump the big guys, 'cause the build-your-own delights here are frickin' amazeballs.....AND they're vegan! What the health?!!?!! So good, I would've never known if it weren't for a tiny sign on the glass case, and all I could think after I started munching was \"how?!\".  You walk in and the sweet smell of cinnamon love envelops you like the best hug ever. No frills decor...Almost looks amateur. So many options of frostings and toppings to choose from that one could easily come here every day for a year and get something different. Serious addiction at first bite!!!! Guess I'm a cinnaholic now."}
{"text":"Just opened! So excited. Shop is clean. Staff could smile more, probably the nerves for an opening day. Cashier gave bags to certain people only. Which is a bummer because some customers felt unwelcomed. The delicious goodies were done fresh. It tasted amazing! Ordered a brownie and a plain roll with chocolate frosting. I recommend to order the frosting on the side. Add as you please. Overall it was an okay experience. The environment and atmosphere was a bit on the sad side. I came here getting over being sick, treat myself to hope for the best this darn cold would leave me. But I AM disappointed. I wish the staff would be more excited and welcoming. Come on guys, it's opening day!!! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Been there multiples times. It's pretty damn good every time. Don't listen to any of the mediocre reviews. If you do, then that's your problem and your loss. Product speaks for itself. No need to waste my time writing an extensive review."}
{"text":"Best buns hands down! They have many toppings and frostings to choose from. They also have yummy cookies and my fav the raw cookie dough. And it's all vegan. If you have a sweet tooth or looking for a cookie cake for a treat or even for a birthday check this place out!"}
{"text":"As someone who is EXTREMELY lactose intolerant and finds it very difficult to indulge on dessert, Cinnaholic is a blessing. Came here for my 22nd birthday dessert and everyone couldn't believe how good it is!!! Cinnaholic allows me to spoil my sweet tooth again and everything is so delicious! Even if you're not vegan, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I would recommend trying the icing first before ordering  (The staff was more than accommodating considering I tried Cream cheese, hazelnut, lemon, Raspberry and Cake batter icing before ordering). I didn't end up liking any of the icings. They were all very sweet and had a weird flavor to them. That being said I got a small amount of Vanilla with Cookie dough and Strawberries on top. The roll was fantastic. Although I really could just come back for the cookie dough by itself.the staff was awesome and the roll was delicious. Will be back!"}
{"text":"One word....  WOW!  I never knew there could be so many takes on a cinnamon roll.  I was a little overwhelmed with the variety so I ordered just a regular roll.  Not too sweet and the icing is light and buttery."}
{"text":"This place is a game changer. Amazing rolls. The cookie drizzle is for shizzle. The staff is so friendly. The atmosphere and ambiance is excellent."}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of freshly baked cinnamon rolls but buying them from a shop has always turned out to be a disappointment. Cinnabon was the WORST of them! I was skeptical of this place at first especially with it being vegan but my boyfriend assured me it would be worth it and holy freaking crackers was it ever!!! I just got a plain orange cream and it was literally without a doubt the best cinnamon roll I have ever eaten in my life. Don't hesitate just try one you'll never want to stop eating. I had to make my boyfriend take his away from me to save it lol."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times because it's the closest to us. It's either a hit or miss. We've gotten amazing cinnamon rolls sometimes and other times they tasted like they were a day old (tough to chew). The last time we went, we got there around 9:40 (they close at 10) and were told they ran out of cinnamon rolls for the night. So glad that a location in Henderson is opening since that's closer to us so we will go to that one from now on."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge Cinnamon roll fan like my husband is, but these are good!  I was pleasantly surprised I liked them as much as I did."}
{"text":"My favorite vegan sweet spot. My husband and I compete to get the most rewards points! A must have in my book!"}
{"text":"The rolls tasted pretty good & the non-sugar, vegan taste was wonderful! The girls & I all got one, mine had butterscotch icing, with coconut & marshmallows- Candice & Kayleigh both got the cream cheese icing with different toppings. We might go back...we really love real sugar!!"}
{"text":"You know that feeling you get when you eat something salty or you've been eating clean for a few days and you just need some sweetness on your tongue? Well this is the place to satisfy that craving!  When you guys walk in your greeted by a glass case showing off a few of their already made creations.  The options are unlimited to what you can create here on a cinnamon bun. The food here is super rich so make sure to grab a bottle of water as well. I recommend the peanut butter cream with bananas and a chocolate sauce drizzle. Just writing this I want to go back right now. My only disappointment is the 3 times I've come, the staff is not very attentive. They stand around in the kitchen on their phones. Maybe it's bad luck but all 3 times I see the person that's suppose to take my order back in the kitchen on her phone. 3 times. That's unacceptable, except the cinnamon buns are that damn good. So it's the chance you take. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice flavor and options, but for the money the rolls should be bigger.. mine were also dry"}
{"text":"My first thought was Vegan cinnamon rolls oh no!  I was so wrong. This place has amazing cinnamon rolls. Loved the rocky road"}
{"text":"The place is clean,  which is always the first thing I look for. I had a roll with amaretto and blueberries....omg. Best cinnamon roll I've ever had. They are the perfect texture. I asked for light frosting. They were happy to accommodate. They customize each roll. Tons of frosting choices and toppings, including fresh fruit. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Wow. Everything is vegan and so delicious. Even my non vegan friends agreed. They wanted to go back the next day for more."}
{"text":"Great place. Amazing vegan deserts"}
{"text":"Amazing and great tasting Cinnabons. They weren't heavy and really hit the spot. Staff was extremely nice and attentive to us. We asked a lot of questions and they were eager to help us. They didn't have any brownies but hooked us up with some cookies. We had the PB&J and Pumpkin Pecan; both very different and hard to choose a favorite. They also had a nice set of music playing in the building. I'd totally come back and try the other flavors they have."}
{"text":"Everything smells amazing, so hard to choose!  I tried my cinnamon bun and I almost died because of how delicious it tasted and how delicious it smelled!  I definitely give Cinnaholic five stars, great job!"}
{"text":"Vibes were meh! Customer average... prices a little on the higher end. Buns were ok extra sugary however, if you want to get a sugar comma this is the place. I want to know why my regular bun's frosting tasted like theater popcorn butter (ew). I guess my expectations were high. I don't know but in my opinion nothing extraordinary at Cinnaholic... I am sorry to say."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here... I live that you can customize  your cinnamon roll with endless toppings. It blows my mind that everything  is vegan. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Yes! This place, YES! You can get an old school cinnamon roll or choose your toppings. I had the coconut cream roll and it was so decadent and sinfully tasty! Treat yo self to a Cinnaholic treat!"}
{"text":"Got the strawberry cheesecake bun with strawberries instead of jam. Staff was patient with me trying to figure out what delicious concoction I could piece together. Come to find out the cheesecake was already in the menu."}
{"text":"I completely forgot they are vegan cinnamon rolls because it taste so good it's a little hard to believe. I love the options you get to customize your roll. Hard decision I'll have to come by and try them all!!"}
{"text":"Simply not a fan.  In a place where where baked goods are happening shouldn't it smell amazing?  On the drive home I had to roll down my windows these things smelled like dirty feet.  I kept praying they would taste better than they smelled.  They do, but not by much.  There is no wow factor here, cinnabon is so much better.  The people who work here were not friendly in the least.  Don't bother with getting coffee, the place is completely unprepared to serve it.  No sugar, sweetner, or set up, and God only knows how long they let a random bottle of creamer sit out on the counter.  I was pushed over a lid for my cup across the counter which looked filthy.  Since they didn't have sugar I ended up throwing it straight in the trash anyway.  They open at ten on weekdays and nine on weekends which seems very late for a seemingly breakfast style pastry shop.  No thanks."}
{"text":"What's not to love about vegan cinnamon rolls? They have so many options and the staff is usually really friendly too. I wish they served cups of water though.. like just provide a jug of water and some cups. I don't want to buy a whole bottle of water to wash my cinnamon roll down with."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise! Everything was hot and had a great flavor! I wasn't wild about the peanut butter icing. Everything else really good. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"i wasn't really crazy about sweets before going herbivore or ever cared about a cinnamon roll lol but this place is over the top amazing. i tried the cookie monster and i forgot the other name but i haven't stopped thinking about this place since I've had it. *crying* wish this place wasnt so far!!!!! super yummy."}
{"text":"Holy crap! This is an amazing idea.  I went on vacation and came back to something unfamiliar next to tropical smoothie, Cinnaholic. I talked to my girlfriend about the place and she said she was intrigued when another had checked in on fb. We stopped in today and WOW, I was impressed! I ordered a cinnamon bun with cream cheese icing topped with raspberry and crumbles. Yummmm.   Cinnaholic is one of those places that you didn't know you needed in your life. Warm, gooey, plenty of icing on a huge cinnamon bun. Not overly sweet and great reheated! Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is insanely delicious - there are so many flavors and combos. And all vegan!!! What's not to love?"}
{"text":"The cinnamon rolls are amazing. You can make up whatever you want with the toppings they have on hand but I took 1 star off because the coffee is horrible. I mean horrible. Go to a coffee shop before coming here if you like coffee with sweets. The staff was friendly and the people coming in on a late Sunday afternoon was steady. Again the rolls we're so very, very good."}
{"text":"SO AMAZING ! I could not believe it was vegan. Incredible taste and texture. Truly a one of a kind cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"This place is great! Delicious buns. I always get the old skool with strawberries. The staff is friendly and fun and they always remember us when we come in!"}
{"text":"I got a cinnamon roll covered in graham crackers and chocolate chips. It was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Very tasty and a good treat to try."}
{"text":"So happy that a new dessert destination opened up in Centennial Hills! But so disappointed that the advertised Spring Flavors of Mango & Pineapple are not offered at this location. When asked, the helpful cashier seemed a bit lost as to how to answer me. She looked at the gentleman she was working with & he basically said that those flavors might make an appearance but no guarantee. I was told that I should check with the other location here in Vegas. I called them & they do carry the advertised Mango & Pineapple & was surprised that the Centennial location didn't. So now if I want to try those options I'll have to make a trip, not helpful to me at all. Anyways, plan to wait as they make your Cinnamon Rolls fresh & they do put alot of frosting so mention light on the frosting if you prefer. The cashier was helpful & friendly, no one else was though. I tried the Chai Frosting with bananas & blueberries. My daughter's had vanilla frosting with Cookie Dough & Chocolate drizzle. The Chai flavor was very light- almost tasting just like regular vanilla & my daughter's cookie dough was yummy but heavy & sweet. I'll be back to try other flavors just wish I could try the Mango & Pineapple in Centennial Hills."}
{"text":"Across from McDonald's and LVAC, Cinnaholic is a late nite delight. I visited the bunny joint with the thought of a simple dry pastry. \"Damn I gotta sweet tooth; Run me ova' here before they close.\" Typical summer night... \"What chu want?\" This store come with a mouth full of tastebud trips. I don't even recall the choice we approved of but, The warmth, hot, and moisture of this honeybun added a great end to the night"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST CINNAMON ROLLS EVER!!! I couldn't believe my tastebuds when I found out they were vegan! Kidding me?! Just amazingness!!! I can't wait for their new location opening up on my side of town in centennial!"}
{"text":"Good idea. It's a tasty little sweet treat. I always pass by this place. What caught my attention was it was on shark tank. I love that show I tried it out. It was good ! Good pricing too. But probably something I would only get once, just to try. Haven't really craved for it. ! Go check it out."}
{"text":"Got the groupon for 2 gourmet rolls. The girls behind the counter were great. I ordered a raspberry cheesecake and Cookie Monster roll. OMG absolutely incredible. The roll itself has a different taste to it perhaps because as I've read it's Vegan but can't believe people compare it to Cinnabon NO WAY! This place is far better in my eyes. Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"I got a chai frosted one and it was. So good???? I never knew I needed something like that in my life and I thank you. Thank you. Also the lady that helped me was really nice 8)"}
{"text":"I got a custom cinnamon roll with cream cheese and amaretto icing with chocolate chips. I will come back, because it was actually very tasty, and the cinnamon roll is a substantial size for the price you pay, ($5-6, depending on toppings and icing) but for whatever reason, it smelled very unappetizing. Almost like a trash can.. no offense! I think it was the cream cheese. But regardless, the cinnamon bun itself was very good."}
{"text":"Cute minimalist decor when you step inside. There is a bar with clear instructions as to how you are to create your one of a kind cinnaroll. Plenty of toppings to choose from as well and each are moderately priced. All the frostings  are .50¢ each, while the toppings are .25¢ each. Hard to believe the entire thing is vegan. I created a cream cheese frosted cinnaroll topped with strawberries and graham crackers. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I am normally a Cinnabon guy but my wife is allergic to dairy so we tried this place out. I was a little skeptical before coming in but this place is truly amazing. Everything is dairy free and is delicious.  Truly a unique find. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious my cinnamon roll was! I couldn't even tell it was vegan. I had the peanut butter frosting with bananas and cookie dough. So yummy!!!! It came out hot and quick. We will definitely be back to try more toppings. A little pricey but it was worth it. I would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Vegan heaven, cinnamon rolls are amazing, as well as brownies, and cookies. Been there 3 times, will be going back to get my sugar fix"}
{"text":"Just yes. Gone twice now and I think we're gonna go down their list of pre-made combinations. Got the rocky road and then the maple pecan pie. So much sauce on a fresh warm cinnamon bun has never been so good"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have SO many delicious topping & choices for cinnamon rolls!! I just finished eating a Devil's Food Cake Cinnamon Roll, and it was to die for. I love their flavor combinations and in my opinion they have just the right amount of sweetness.   The staff are incredibly nice and I always look forward to coming in!   It's definitely worth the drive! Hope they open more locations."}
{"text":"These are the best cinnamon rolls ever and they are VEGAN!  I tried the Banana Foster and PB&J.  The Banana was my favorite so far but I will try them all eventually :)"}
{"text":"Raheem was excellent. He helped me and my friends I think I can call them friends, pick out a delicious Cinnabon and allowed us to feel satisfied"}
{"text":"OMG, I am in cinnamon bun heaven.   I love Cinnaholic.   I have been tempted to stop by this  delicious dessert shop, but I've never had the time. However today, I wanted to surprise my husband with something yummy.   Greeting: As soon as I walked into the story, I was greeted by a beautiful women with a warm welcome and a smile. This was my first time here so I had to look over the menu. I didn't have to ask for help becauseI had  yelp to thank, but the employee did offer great suggestions.  Order: My husband loves peanut butter so I ordered him the highly suggested peanut butter cup and I suck with the classic. Our cinnamon bun was soooooo good. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie that I couldn't eat because I was stuffed.  Menu: The menu is a bit overwhelming because you can customize everything. Whatever you want they have it. They even have a menu of popular cinnamon buns to hell you out like SMORES, Apple Pie etc. They sell brownies, cookies, and even smaller buns.  Cinnaholic is Yum and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I Don't live in Vegas but when I come to visit family this place is a must on things to eat when I come. Especially being a vegan and having a HUGE sweet tooth this place is the bomb.com and hits the spot each time."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for while now since this location recently opened up in Henderson. Decided to stop in on a late Sunday morning hoping to grab a scrumptious sweet treat that I had been craving. While the staff at this place was friendly and the prices per cinnamon role were reasonable, I have to admit that I wasn't as impressed with my cinnamon role as I thought I would be. The frosting was decent and the strawberry fruit topping was tasty, but the roll itself seemed cold and very dry. I was expected a piping hot roll that would melt the icing into the delicious ooey goodness one would hope for when indulging in a cinnamon roll. Maybe I went to late in the morning and the rolls had already been made a few hours before, I'm not sure. Best thing I could recommend would be to try to go early and see if you can get the nice hot cinnamon roll that your heart desires. I may give this place another shot, but not in the near future."}
{"text":"Transaction started off great, Cinnamon rolls tastes great, but customer service and steps the staff make are horrible.   Rahiem was awesome taking my order over the phone, friendly, gathering the correct information and giving me an estimated time when it's ready, 2:30. He even allowed me to use three coupons; $3 off, free cookie and free old school.   When I arrived at 2:30 nothing was ready. Alicia said the dough for the baby buns was still proofing, which I understand it takes time to cook, but don't give me an estimate time when it ready and it's completely off. It would be another 17 minutes. I told them how I'm traveling with these prior, I have enough time, but now I'm going to be running late to the airport.   I ended up re-ordering regular buns which they had a few ready already, not the baby buns, and Alicia would not honor Rahiem using the 3 coupons. She wouldn't even give me anything to compensate for messing up my order and wasting my time, until I made a big deal and she settled with giving a free cookie.   Horrible service, give your customers a correct time estimate, have your products ready and accept responsibility for being at fault."}
{"text":"I love love love this place even though it's bad for me. I'm actually here to pick up a dozen of the minis for an office and this is what they wanted."}
{"text":"I have had some excellent cinnamon rolls but the quality of those served here at Cinnaholic put them in my top 5! I don't know how the prepped to-go ones taste but I saw plenty of those sell while I indulged myself. The multitude of frostings and toppings to customize the perfect 'roll' pushed this over the edge! I wanted something kind of light and bright so I ordered pineapple frosting with shredded coconut and strawberry jam. This is phenomenal and I'll definitely stop by early when I next visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I love cinnamon buns but they added a Twist to it that makes it even better good service and fast I had a bit of an issue with the payment when I saw my statement but the manager was friendly and took care of it immediately"}
{"text":"Cinnaholic was the first Vegan bakery where I didn't feel the Vegan thing being shoved down my throat. The signs don't have Vegan written anywhere.  The cinnamon rolls were way better than their famous shopping mall sister shop. They were fresh and could be customized to your liking.  The hazelnut spread was good, but way too thick as well as the other frosted rolls we got. If you're looking for something a little less sweet/heavy ask for light frosting. They have premade flavors as well as build your own. The shop was on Shark Tank! Never did I think, this is good.... for being Vegan. Cinnaholic was good for Vegan, it was good compared to non-Vegan."}
{"text":"The cinnamon rolls here were amazing! We were a little skeptical to eat here at first since it was empty and very quiet it looked as if it was closed."}
{"text":"Cinnaholic in Las Vegas- my dreams have come true! Bringing a little piece of Berkeley to my new home.   This franchise brings back all the wonderful memories of the OG Cinnaholic in Berkeley, CA. Same cool atmosphere, friendly staff, and mind-blowingly delicious cinnamon rolls. It's still hard to believe it's all vegan! The icing tastes buttery and not overly sweet, and the buns are light and fluffy. And the toppings are just sinful.   This place is not gonna be good for my diet"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened and I'm never disappointed! The cinnamon rolls are baked fresh and I love the Old Skool with the vanilla frosting. Usually I add some kind of fruit (and chocolate!) since it's already sweet enough. These can definitely serve two people. I highly recommend this place for any time of day!"}
{"text":"This is a 6 month follow-up to my original review. This business has grown tremendously but so has the shopping center. There are a lot of conveniences and eateries here! My next suggestion is to offer free WiFi and this will be a awesome place to linger. I recently moved to the area and could see me strolling through with my dog for the outside seating."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. They were playing that 70's show. The bathroom design is nice too. Also the proces are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love this idea, the rolls taste so fresh and the options for toppings are very nice!! I just think they need a little consistency on how they portion their toppings - sometimes I will get mega lucky, sometimes it is not impressive. Haha. However, I love their vibe and I've always had friendly and fast customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is so-so. I love cinnamon rolls and wanted to love love this place so badly. But I was left a bit disappointed. The problem is that their base is not delicious in itself. It was kinda stale and hard & not enough of that delicious cinnamon gooeyness I look forward to when eating a cinnamon roll.  Perhaps I went at a bad time. I'll try it again and hopefully next time, I'll be blown away and can update this post and star rating."}
{"text":"Talk about an extensive menu!  Anything you could possibly want on a cinnamon roll is possible at Cinnaholic.  We tried five different versions on our first trip (which won't be our last), including the turtle, and birthday cake, which are specialty rolls they've already created for you.  For our own creations, we went with chocolate icing, cookie dough and chocolate sauce for the first one.  Next, we tried cream cheese icing with bananas and caramel sauce.  And finally, marshmallow icing with fresh strawberries.  They were all fabulous and generous in portion size.  Our were hot out of the oven, so we did have to wait 9 minutes, but they were worth it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it. Gave 2 stars because the topping ideas are great.  We got 4 cinnamon rolls & 1 brownie. No one took more than a few bites. Sadly, they tasted like the canned kind."}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing cinnamon roll.  Hard to believe that they accomplish so much, while being gluten-free."}
{"text":"Sooooo sweet!! Like over the accepted range of sweet. Like diabetes in a bite sweet.  I love cinnamon rolls and was excited to try Cinnaholic but I'm not sure if I'll be back... It was yummy but honestly very VERY sweet. I tried the a beautiful Amaretto roll with almonds, raspberries, and chocolate chips. The Amaretto gave the creation a very nice flavor but it was a sugar overload. I also tried a friend's chocolate cheesecake (I considered getting that as well) and did not care for it... The rolls did not taste too fresh either, that may have contributed to my disintrest in returning. In all fairness, we were there about 6-7pm. May be th4e rolls are made in the morning for the day? Staff was super helpful and patient with two indecisive patrons and did not mind chatting. Tons of various flavors and toppings. I really want to give Cinnaholic benefit of the doubt but they are not for me."}
{"text":"1st time going.  Very nice looking establishment.  Employees are friendly.  Customer service is awesome!  The old skool Cinnabon was very delicious.  The family enjoyed the Cinnabon, chocolate chip cookie and the brownies were so moist and delicious.  We will most definitely be returning.  Especially since your employee offered us to join the rewards program."}
{"text":"Great spot for some indulgent pastries. I took the recommendation from the employee and got the peanut butter frosting with bananas and it was amazing."}
{"text":"My cinnamon roll was amazing! I got the classic old skool... i would give 5 stars if they had different size option of cinnamon rolls, but for the price you get an awesome large amount of cinnamon roll goodness. Also there was so much frosting on mine, but next time I'll just get it on the side:) other than that it was so good!!"}
{"text":"First time i've eaten at a new concept that originated from a pitch on the show Shark Tank!  These guys are on to something! The flavors/toppings that go with these buns are fantastic! You would never know everything is 100% vegan!   My first try, i got the \"Strawberry Shortcake\" (cream cheese spread, strawberries and cookie crumble). It was delicious! They have several spread/topping options. You can create your own or choose from one of their classic creations.  Right now, they're only located in Indian trail but I've heard from staff that they are planning on expanding to Charlotte in the near future!"}
{"text":"It's shocking that something vegan could be so delicious. I would have never been able to tell that this delicious dessert was vegan by the taste. If only vegan meant calorie free....This was one of the stops on a sugar crawl with friends. I'm not typically in this part of town so the crawl gave me the push to venture over this way and I'm so glad that I did.  The options for these tasty rolls are impressive. There are about 20 frosting options and 20 topping options. Several ideas for creations designed by Cinnaholic are displayed next to the register. So helpful for those that can be overwhelmed by so many options.  We shared the Bananas Foster. Wow! The roll was good and the frosting on top was really delicious. I absolutely loved the flavor of the frosting. The bananas foster part was really tasty too. The roll was not tiny, it would be a large dessert for one and would probably be best split between two.   It'd be cool if they had a mini roll option as well. I would love a way to try multiple flavors without eating more than the equivalent of one roll. Mini rolls would be a good way to do that or even a mini roll sampler.  I'm already looking for reasons that I can return to this area to have my next delicious roll!"}
{"text":"The cinnamon rolls are just as good as I remember from my last visit to another location. It's hard to believe these sweet treats are vegan. Vegan is a four letter word to my husband and he raved over the cinnamon rolls and cookie dough.   There are so many possibilities for how many customized rolls can be made from all of the frostings and toppings. For those that get overwhelmed by too many options there are also suggested creations in the display.   I created my own roll with amaretto frosting, caramel sauce, and pie crumble. My roll was amazing. The texture and taste of the roll was perfection. The frosting and sauce were delicious. The pie crumble topping was a brown sugar oat kind of topping and it worked so well with the roll. My husband went with a Birthday Cake roll which also had an amazing flavor.   To enjoy later we both ordered a Cookie Dough as well. My S'more Cookie Dough was amazing, buttery and full of flavor. It tasted just like the real thing. My husband's Cookies-N-Cream Cookie Dough was also delicious.  Our orders didn't take too long to prepare. Fresh batches of rolls are made regularly so sometimes it can take a minute. It's totally worth it for the hot from the oven roll. Pricing is reasonable for the portions and amazing quality."}
{"text":"Definitely the best cinnamon roll in the universe (for now). Comes with tons of frosting on top.  Definitely a sugar high. But never mind its so worth it"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:45 they were out of cinnamon buns, not a good!!! Very unhappy customer!!! And they didn't apologize!'n"}
{"text":"$5.00 for a cinnamon bun..really not that impressed!! The inside of the roll was a little raw & doughy. Not worth the money.. employee was not very friendly!!! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Cinnamon rolls with toppings? Raw cookie dough? Who wouldn't like this place? Crazy people? Everything is delicious. Fattening but delicious."}
{"text":"Holy moly....I've found it, the place I've been dreaming of! You won't be sorry if you have to drive out of your way to try this. Thank you thank thank you for opening this gourmet cinnamon bun business."}
{"text":"First day opened I stood in line for a half hour but it was worth it as these are the best cinnamon rolls around."}
{"text":"The best cinnamon roll I've ever had! The best part is that it is all vegan ingredients and it doesn't taste like it at all. They have a variety of toppings and frostings you can pick from, so you can completely customize your order! The special cinnamon rolls of the day never disappoint either. I've told at least 10 people about this place and they've had the same experience. I hope this chain keeps expanding- its delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Wow! I ordered 2 via Uber eats, a classic one and a chocolate bomb. They're way more than what I expected and I'm more than satisfied. It came quick and in individual boxes, they look and taste amazing and the price is really fair."}
{"text":"OMG.... Great Buns and Great Service. Each one is made fresh with quality ingredients and added bonus, they have the option of joining their loyalty program. Doesn't taste Vegan at all! You'd never even know."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and each time I bring someone new with me friends family co workers etc I tell them it's vegan upfront lol for the reaction right after they taste the amazing cinnamon roll the look on their face is amazing Nooo it can't be vegan u sure ? I'm a chocolate lover so I get chocolate every time or coffee I ordered the pb&j for my bf my friend got hers topped with strawberries one time the staff very helpful it's packed sometimes but it takes about 5-10 mins for the food everything is made fresh I also get the brownies & chocolate chip cookies omg sooo soft & moist they have sooo many options you can never go wrong"}
{"text":"Buyers beware! Extremely addictive and delicious!!! Cinnaholic offers the tastiest cinnamon rolls in town, and both vegans & non-vegans can easily enjoy the yummy treat.  Cinnaholic was always on my list of new places to try, but I never got around to it because I kept correlating cinnamon rolls with Cinnabon, which is not the most exciting cinnamon roll. I finally decided to give it a try and boy, was I surprised! I ordered the Old School roll to test the waters and I was immediately hooked. The cinnamon roll was big, light, and well balanced in terms of flavor. After I tried the original roll with vanilla frosting, I became more adventurous with their flavors. Every time I went in, I tried a different flavor combo. From seasonal flavors to fruity ones like Triple Berry, I ended up finding my favorite - a cinnamon roll with banana cream frosting. No matter how simple or how crazy your tastebuds may be, you CAN'T go wrong here. Everything is customizable and made to suit anyone's flavor profile. Cinnaholic is a guilt-free way to indulge because you know that no animals were harmed to provide us with such delectable treats! All in all, I'm a big, BIG fan and I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Good vegan cinnamon rolls. I'd say slightly overpriced but overall very good. I would recommend to anybody looking for a good vegan cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"I stopped in on Sunday and had no idea what to order. Luckily, they do have some of the most popular options in the case when you first walk in. I decided to go with Cookies and Cream. The Cinnamon roll is huge and it has more than enough frosting. The cinnamon roll was soft and held up well to the amount of frosting. The cookies were a good size and still crispy in the frosting and not soggy. The chocolate chips on top were definitely an added bonus.   I am vegetarian, so this is a good option if you try to patronize vegan/vegetarian establishments."}
{"text":"I had been hearing a lot about how amazing this place was so I was really excited to give it a try. Neither location is particularly close to me, so it was a must when I found myself on this side of town.  I am not Vegan, but I am always excited for that option, especially if it as just as good as the original.  I went with a friend and we each ordered a a cinnamon roll and then shared a tub of cookie dough. The cinnamon rolls are cooked to order so they are warm and gooey when you get them. I liked the concept of being able to choose frosting/toppings to customize you roll. I chose maple frosting with walnuts and my friend opted for cake batter frosting with cookie dough topping.  Mine was good, but far from spectacular. My maple frosting wasn't nearly maple-y enough and the walnuts on top were whole, not chopped, which made eating a little difficult. My friend felt that the roll was a bit doughy, but overall liked it. They are someone who normally wouldn't try anything that even says vegan...and they didn't know what they were eating was vegan...so the fact that they liked it says a lot. Neither of us like that their cookie dough topping was literally a raw cookie thrown on top.  The roll itself left me a little conflicted. As far as cinnamon rolls go, it was average. However, given that it was vegan, and knowing that vegan baked goods can be obviously not so good...I felt like that should get special consideration. If I judge against other cinnamon rolls I would give this a B-. If I judge against other vegan desserts I've had, I would bump it up to an A-.  The little? tub of cookie dough was excellent and neither of us could detect any difference in taste from a grocery store tube or something you would make at home. Taste and texture were spot on.   I love that there are so many vegan/vegetarian options popping up all over town. Even without being vegan, I like having options. This is definitely a great option for a quick breakfast or dessert!  I like that they have multiple locations with evening hours. If you're a fan of cinnamon rolls you should definitely check them out."}
{"text":"We went in today and were planning on ordering a cinnamon roll to go. But the owner, Marco, was there and suggested we get one that can have the toppings placed on the side. But we decided to enjoy it there. I ordered the pumpkin pecan cinnamon roll and my son a chocolate chip cookie. The roll was so delicious! It was buttery & light and perfect! Not too sweet but just right. The owner was very nice and informative & the cashier was awesome too. I will definitely recommend cinnaholic and will be going back!"}
{"text":"These cinnamon buns are to die for! There are so many combinations of icings and other toppings that you could probably eat here every day for a few years and never have the same thing twice. I've tried a few combos, but my favorite so far is peanut butter icing with cookie dough topping - completely decadent!  The staff is really friendly, and they play great music!"}
{"text":"BEST. CINNAMON ROLL. EVER. We actually thought the cinnamon rolls were pretty small so when we got them through uber eats, we were surprised at how good of a size they were. We tried \"Cookie monster\" and \"Chocolate Bomb.\" Not to sweet in my opinion and was warm when we got them! Can't wait wait to try the other rolls!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on Saturday night. I will be going back, it took 15 minutes for our order to go but everything was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"100% vegan cinnamon rolls plus all the extras! Worth every calorie and penny! Friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"Drove in from Henderson to check this place out, totally worth the drive. Best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! I had the chocolate peanut butter banana and my boyfriend had the cookies and cream. We will be back again! 5 stars."}
{"text":"Couldn't love this place more!! The cinnamon rolls are so gooey and moist, so much flavor and sweetness. You walk in and are greeted with a friendly hello and smile. I'm a huge fan of the peanut butter frosting with brownie bites and caramel sauce. To die for!!"}
{"text":"There should be like 20 cinnaholic shops around the valley. This place is to die for. A true orgasm in your mouth lol. These guys have stole my business for Life I'll never go back to Cinnabon ever again. They even gave me a cool sticker for my toolbox. #lifer"}
{"text":"Being completely transparent with you guys- I don't like cinnamon rolls. I can't tell you why other than I just don't really see what the fuss is about. I don't hate them, but I don't love them you know? So on trip to Vegas, a friend of mine said we had to go and who am I to stop someone from doing what they want on vacation? So I sort of begrudgingly came to Cinnaholic's with her and was actually pretty pleased with the experience.  So if you don't know (I didn't prior to this), Cinnaholic was featured on the show, \"Shark Tank\". These cinnamon rolls come in a variety of flavors and toppings. What makes them so unique? They are 100 percent vegan. It's like my two least favorite things had a child and made something pretty delicious. All of their products are dairy & lactose free, egg-free, and free of cholesterol- but full of flavor.  Options, options, options. So many options. Even from size of cinnamon rolls, you have your pick. I got a mini because I was totally afraid I'd hate it. The mini is kind of the size of a cupcake, which was perfect. You can choose frosting flavors like almond, coffee, maple, marshmallow, orange, and chai. And why not top it off with some coconut, apples, pecans, or almonds? Or just get the frosting. Or get it plain. Whatever makes you happy.  The kid behind the counter was super helpful. Very friendly and you can tell loved working there which makes the experience even better.  Now, I gotta say, I don't know if I'm truly reformed and want to eat cinnamon rolls from now on, but if I'm back in Vegas, I might have to get in my rental car and drive over here for a bun or two."}
{"text":"First time here today!  WOW!!!!!  I had the peanut butter and pretzel!  Un-freakin-belivievable......definitely worth it, whether it's the cost, the diet, the sugar rush....it doesn't matter.  A must try!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Experienced racism by gentleman taking orders yesterday.   He notified everyone before me and after me of the wait time of 6 minutes and asked them if that was OK for them and if they mind waiting.  When he took my order he NEVER gave me the same courtesy he provided to them.  Being intelligent and not jumping to conclusions,  I thought to myself maybe everyone before me ordered something different. So I asked, 'whats the wait time'? He responded 5 to 6 minutes or so.  Never asked he if I mind waiting or that work for ME.  So I stepped back and observed him taking orders after mine. Just to be sure. And again they were provided an explanation and an option.  I was the only African American in the store.  I haven't experienced selective racism in a long time.  For the record I love ALL people and we are raising our children to love ALL people.  And we (my family) and I will unapologeticly call out and expose any form of racism we experience, especially at an establishment where we spend our money.  $75 per week at this establishment for example. When you know better you will do better.."}
{"text":"YUM! When my husband mentioned \"cinnamon rolls\" I was instantly for it. Came into the Cinnaholic not knowing you can customize your roll to your liking and interesting to know that the rolls are vegan! There are a lot of toppings and frosting flavors to create your own concoction=) I got the old skool roll topped with blueberries and I loved it! The dough was super soft, fluffy, and warm. It tasted fresh and the frosting wasn't too sweet. My son got the baby bun and he loved that, perfect for kids!   Service was fast and the employees greeted us when we walked in.   Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Um what? All vegan and amazing. The cookies and cookie dough scoops are so good and they let you design your own cinnamon roll. It's hard to bake vegan and they have it down pat."}
{"text":"You have a sweet tooth. This is the best place to get your fix. They make some of the freshest sweats ever."}
{"text":"I really don't think I can explain the world's best cinnamon rolls with words but I'll try. This place is like heaven and he'll in your mouth. Heaven because it tastes like Beyonce is hosting a party on your taste buds and he'll because you feel fat after one bite. It was like I was feeding myself as a God. I tried so hard to eat the whole thing but I just couldn't. I got the marshmallow and cotton candy icing with pretzel topping only. It's amazing stuff can taste this good without cow milk nor eggs. My boyfriend's was super bad a too but I don't remember his choice of toppings. My only regret in life is not checking this place out sooner. amen."}
{"text":"Too complicated and too long of process. They need some standard favorites on the menu besides their Old Skool. Took 20 mins. To get my order upon entry with only one person in front of me in line."}
{"text":"Super cute place, friendly staff and amazing food! They let you try all the flavors if you want. They even have Netflix on there Tvs! Would be a great place for a first date or a place to bring the family! There is something for everyone here  Come by and have fun! :)"}
{"text":"Do not even ask yourself the question if you should come here or not. The answer is a resounding YES!!   It was my first time here and I was overwhelmed by how to order, but they have a display of some of their pre-made cinnamon rolls. There was another lady who had ordered plain rolls. She loves Cinnaholic so much that once she got her rolls, she gave me a bite so I knew how good it was. And it was!   I ordered the Almond Joy and built my own with hazelnut icing, almonds and pecans. Both were delicious and both were eaten in one day! I'm going to have to control myself from going everyday because even though the rolls are vegan, they are filled with sugary goodness. The rolls I ordered came out to a little more than $13 but depending on what you put on yours, it could cost more.   This place is definitely a keeper and my new go to for cinnamon rolls. They've outranked Cinnabon and I don't feel too guilty about eating two in a day. Bring your family here. Bring your friends here. Bring your first date, your dog, a stranger, EVERYONE! You can't go wrong with Cinnaholic!!"}
{"text":"It's a cool concept! You can have yourself a good old fashioned cinnamon roll or dress it up with their choices of frosting and toppings!  The best part is definitely that it is free of dairy and eggs--and they are very careful with nuts. Those with allergies or some type of intolerance to these products have less to worry about. The palm oil is sustainably sourced and the sugar is not filtered with bone char, making these scrumptious rolls vegan.  I have yet to verify if all of their toppings are vegan (for example: graham crackers regularly contain milk or honey, while marshmallows are made from gelatin), as I am aware that their frostings are. I'm not sure why they wouldn't be, seeing as how everything else is, but it's always good to confirm.  Being 100% vegan was not thoroughly advertised in the store. Though, I did see a sticker in the corner of the display case. To avoid holding up the line, I picked a fuss-free topping--walnuts. Unfortunately, those with soy and sensitivity to wheat will have to skip out.  I went on opening day; the process of ordering and picking up was self explanatory. There are plenty of options to choose from, and I have uploaded photos of what my family and I took home that evening. Overall, it's nice to have a dessert spot that accommodates my friends, family and myself. Everyone can choose what they want for themselves! And with it being so close to home, I will definitely be returning and trying out more flavors and combinations! Cinnaholic is truly a treat!"}
{"text":"4 stars because they are vegan cinnamon rolls! With that being said, these are ridiculously sweet like they quite physically hurt my teeth, so have a serious sweet tooth when you come here. The service is average, the girl was nice but seemed all together uninterested. I like the fact that they serve almond milk, yum! The mini buns are cute but mine were solid and room temperature. This was probably a one time thing for me, but good none the less"}
{"text":"Delicious! I try to be adventurous (but I'm a plain Jane) and this is definitely the place to do so... so many awesome build your own cinnamon roll options! Well, of course I went for plain ol cream cheese frosting... and walnuts with a chunk of cookie dough on top not TOO crazy considering their many options, but next time I will definitely venture out. Love that it's vegan and still appeals to my often anti-vegan tastes. No gluten-free options (yet) but well worth my $5+ and more unique than getting a Cinnabon. Too close to my house and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The Cinnabon rolls are made to order and are the bomb!!! Especially dig the strawberry sauce/icing with it. I know is sounds odd but to my surprise the strawberry one was SO GOOD and if you do t want to sin to much they also have \" minis\" ! Yea!"}
{"text":"Wasn't much of a fan!  Concept is similar to any build your own anytime. You start with a plain roll, you add what kind of frosting you want, toppings you want, and sauce you want. There is a ton to select from in each category so there are so many ways to make your cinnamon roll.   There is also a build menu that they have created so you can order off that as well.  We tried the sticky bun creation and it wasn't very good. I had a bite and that was it. The roll itself wasn't soft, has probably been baked for quite some time.   There was so much they added on top which made it sooo sweet, yes I know I got a sticky bun cinnamon roll which will be sweet I'm aware, but too sweet is not good.   I would prefer a Cinnabon over this the next time I'm craving a cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time ever, at 3pm place was empty but that works for me as I don't enjoy crowds lol I chose coconut frosting with pecans and oreo for toppings. It was absolutely delicious! And huge! I shared it with my boyfriend and was more than enough to satisfied us. The worker was friendly and the tables very clean. We'll definitely come back again.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the price (a little bit pricey in my opinion)  Oh and everything they use and have is Vegan!!"}
{"text":"The banana foster cinnamon roll with amaretto frosting is sooooo good! The girl at the register suggested it and she did not disappoint. I'm coming back to try more for sure"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a new place to indulge your sweet tooth, this is it.   When ordering your cinnamon roll, you have a choice of an old school roll (classic cinnamon bun), a number of combinations they've thought up, or you can choose to customize it yourself with your choice of frosting and toppings. The shop also offers edible cookie dough, cookies, and brownies.   I decided to customize my own cinnamon bun with marshmallow frosting and the edible cookie dough and while I loved it and it was so worth it, it was so much sugar. I think I'll split it next time. The cinnamon rolls do come hot out of the oven and it takes about 5-10 minutes after you order to get your roll, especially if the store is kind of busy.   I'm looking forward to bringing friends here, trying out different roll combinations, and maybe even getting a tray of the mini buns or a \"cinnacake\" for a party in the future. This is a really creative idea and a tasty little shop!"}
{"text":"Grand opening this morning. I stopped by at 9am but they didn't open until 10am the hours not listed outside yet. Went back at 10:30 and the line made a circle around the small inside lobby. Cute decor, large screen tv on back wall playing music videos. Only a few tables but the to-go business was booming. You choose your frosting flavor and then a topping if you like and all the rolls are baked and served while still warm. An amazing feat of timing. Rolls were soft, good flavor, and not a bad wait considering the line. My box was a mess, frosting all over it and it got on the seat in my car but I just licked it off. Lol $5.50 each with flavored frosting and 1 topping."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of the hardest parts about going vegan was giving up cinnamon rolls (and cinnabon) but this place is waaaaaay better than cinnabon. There are so many options and they have beverages, too! Clean environment, friendly staff and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely unique! You can pretty much put whatever you want on your cinnamon roll. Or you can choose a menu item. Everyone working there has been polite and helpful. Also, their cookie dough is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Went in, very unorganized - however,  these cinnamon rolls,  OMG... they are freshly made to order,  the toppings are fresh,  and you walk away with a hot cinnamon roll. This yummy goodness made up for the service."}
{"text":"First time visiting, Marco was very patient and explanted everything patiently. Thanks for the great customer service Marco"}
{"text":"Best vegan cinnamon roll I've ever had. Best all around cinnamon roll I've ever had. So soft so delicious. Great customer service here as well."}
{"text":"Not just another cinnamon roll bake shop. As seen on The Shark Tank, Cinnaholic manages to make delicious classic cinnamon rolls that is vegan friendly. It's not gluten free, but it is dairy free if that matters to you. I remember seeing the founders of Cinnaholic on Shark Tank and they are based out of Georgia. So it was exciting to see they opened a new location in the Henderson area.   The Old School Classic has a simple frosting and it is a delicious hit. Super moist, full of cinnamon delight, and just enough sweetness in the frosting to hit that sugar tooth. The best part is that a fresh batch comes out about every 12 minutes. The sugar is from beets not cane. They also sell cinnamon bites which are mini rolls if you don't want a whole one. Then there are the toppings. You can add cookie crumbs, fresh fruits, chocolate chips, and a variety of frosting to deck out your roll. The classic roll starts around 5 dollars and it goes up with additional toppings.   They also have a cinnacake which may be an alternative to a traditional cake, but you have to preorder that. They also sell cookie dough by the ounce. Possibly dangerous on a rainy day. Sometimes they have day old buns for sell for half price, but those go quickly too. You can grab a seat and enjoy it in the store or take it to go.  The store is clean and the workers are helpful every time I went. Glad to have this shop open in the neighborhood. Have fun with it and enjoy the sticky gooey goodness!"}
{"text":"Once you open the door, the aroma that hits you is so heavenly! The flavors and variety offered for a nice warm cinnamon roll is awesome! I ordered  a cream cheese sauce with strawberry and almonds roll. Delicious and oh so sweet! Would come back here for sure whenever I'm craving for a sweet dessert!"}
{"text":"Vegan cinnamon rolls. Really tasty, and that's coming from a guy who is into heavy creams, butter, beef and all the best binding agents in wheat.   Good coffee too.  I love that there is no forced paper receipt.   Classic roll was great. The cream cheese frosting isn't the same as real cream cheese, but it is the best impersonation I've had. My wife had that blueberry thing in the picture and it was delicious as well.   We'll return.  Edit- earlier I said the rolls were gluten free. I was wrong, and the owners corrected it for me. Still, these are GREAT."}
{"text":"Amazing! Loved how you can customize your own roll. It tasted amazing and their vegan."}
{"text":"Definitely satisfied my craving. A bit expensive but I would recommend if you want to try.  I got an original cinnamon roll, added brownie pieces and chocolate syrup."}
{"text":"I recently ordered ubereats from this location. I usually enjoy there cinnamons rolls from other locations, I've only visited this one twice. My cinnamon roll barely had any frosting on it which was disappointing because the roll was soft and sweet. Unfortunately my boyfriends cinnamon roll and a hair in it.  definitely won't be ordering Ubereats again."}
{"text":"So I don't have a picture because I ate the whole thing so fast and didn't take a picture! I really loved the cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and caramel sauce! We also got a day old plain roll and Pecan pie roll and Almond frosting with almonds. We will have those with coffee tomorrow. I highly recommend them whenever you have a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Great gourmet cinnamon buns with a variety of toppings! I tried the rocky road cinnamon bun. The bun was very large, and it came warm with loads of toppings. It was topped with chocolate chips, nuts , marshmallows and a sweet sauce. This dessert was big enough for two people to share. All the ingredients were fresh and the toppings were freshly added when I ordered it. A definite recommend for your sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that I couldn't afford six of these bad boys to take home.  While this place isn't super obvious as a vegan spot, it's become a legend in the CLT vegan community.  Don't go thinking that makes it healthy, or anything, but enjoy!  We got a vanilla frosted banana topped with Carmel as well as a cream cheese frosted with strawberry jam.  Both were excellent but I would personally recommend the banana! They were a little difficult to eat and I can imagine if it gets crowded on a weekend it wouldn't be fun to battle the small space but we had no trouble and loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Dairy free cinnamon rolls! So soft and tasty! Pretty large was able to share between my son and husband. Pecan turtle was amazing but one time we got raspberry it wasn't as good."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with this deliciousness!! Besides making my own, I've never had cinnamon buns bought from a location, but OMG these are awesome!! We had these at night right after putting our kiddos to bed; yeah I said it it was a treat for us and we didn't share it! Hubby rewarmed it in the microwave and it was still fantastic, we will be returning soon and maybe next time I'll share!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first but great customer service they're very patient you can build your own or go with one of their featured items amazing freshly baked definitely worth a check out calm down that sweet tooth"}
{"text":"BAD EXPERIENCE. If I could give negative stars I would've! I ordered 2 dozens of the cinnamon bites for my friend's birthday. I called around 9:10am and they guy that answered was acting really annoyed with my questions. I certainly felt unwelcome and that I was inconveniencing him. I guess it's cause I called 10 minutes after they opened but that shouldn't be an excuse. I let that pass trying to make excuses for this person. I still went on with my order. After about 30 minutes, we came in and picked up the 2 dozens we ordered and I was so surprised on how shitty it looked like. The buns were sideways, the icing looked like it was just slabbed everywhere, the box was gross and dusty!!! I  was so embarrassed to give it to my friend who is celebrating his birthday. I am so disappointed with this place. I cannot believe how rudely I was treated and then I get a shitty product. There was no way to get a receipt other than give your email to them. So we gave our email (cause there was no other option) but still did not get a receipt. Total bs. Service sucks!"}
{"text":"Went there on Thursday Dec. 28 and was excited to try it out. There were a lot of people in front of us but we seemed to get our order first. I got the Cinnaholic with banana cream, marshmallow cream and fresh bananas. After that is was all down hill! I spent the rest of the night throwing up and having diarrhea. I went to the ER with severe dehydration. Something was expired and didn't sit well in my stomach. Thanks Cinnaholic, that was one expensive item. Never will you see me be a patron there. Check your items on the expiration date! Spending my New Years recovering"}
{"text":"Coffee Cake is my favorite !! Got one for my friend An daughter today !! It was my friends first time to have it and guess what ????? !!!!!! She LoVed It .. she said \"I'm going to just take a bite Annnnnnd eat it later\" ummmmm well that didn't happen the 1 bite turned into finishing it off An licking the fingers clean"}
{"text":"Such a delicious cinnamon roll. If they didn't tell you it was vegan, you'd probably never know! Definitely recommending this place."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I can't believe it's VEGAN! Okay - non vegan peeps, don't let the \"vegan\" tag scare you! My boyfriend have taken now countless family and friends here without first telling them these delicious treats were vegan and literally NO ONE could tell. No one even believed it until we showed them proof! Lol.  Not gunna lie, every time we come here I get a classic old school cinnamon roll to devour there then take home a specialty roll and a chocolate chip cookie or two for the boyfriend and I to enjoy for the next couple days afterwards! It's that addicting!  I've grown up as the usual Cinnabon fan and this place seriously tops them, no questions asked! Each dessert satisfies your sweet tooth without the tooth ache or gritty too-much-sugar feeling in your mouth afterwards!  As far as the seating and staff - the staff is super friendly and has your orders out by the time you pick from one of the dozens of tables!  This place will amaze you if you're up for it!"}
{"text":"I'm shook. When we first entered the building, the guy behind the counter greeted us and asked if we've ever been there before. This place is the Chipotle of cinnamon rolls. There is different flavors of icings and toppings to choose from. Since my boyfriend and I have never been there before, we played it save and got a traditional cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll came out in lightning speed. The cinnamon roll was covered in icing and was so buttery. The guy behind the counter gave us their most popular topping to try - chocolate chips. This place has some bomb cinnamon rolls - we will be back."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times and was happy but just went again and had bad experience. Waited in line, no smile/greeting or told I'll be with you shortly. Just as I get next in line, the employee goes inside to kitchen and comes out with a tray of rolls and informs me it's going to be 12 minutes.  Firstly, how do you not continually have rolls cooking or ready, that's all you sell.  Secondly, mistakes happen I get it but no excuse for rude service"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 cinnamon rolls to go. One with cream cheese icing and \"the king\" with maple, chocolate, graham crackers, and marshmallows. Both were excellent! I love that this place is all vegan. Makes my heart happy. The employees were nice. The only downside is that it was packed and it's a bit small. I'm sure it will be great once they get past opening weekend!"}
{"text":"The concept of the idea is great, but it's pretty pricy. One cinnamon roll is close to $5 without any toppings, and when you start to build your own then it gets pricy. Service wasn't the best, seemed like the cashier who was there didn't want to be there. Also it's really sweet, so if you have a big sweet tooth, then I recommend this place for you. If not, then definitely avoid this place and get some ice cream instead."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! You get to select frosting(s) of your choice, in addition to toppings including sweet toppings or fruit. Absolutely love that this place is cruelty-free, and tastes even better than any regular cinnamon roll place. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! You would never know this is vegan. Wonderful assortment of flavor combinations and specialty cinnamon buns using current fresh fruit ingredients. So much better than that place in the mall!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place thru my fiancé. As a person who love sweets, I wanted to give a try. Ordered the butter pecan frosting on a cinnamon roll with bananas and thought it was ok. Didn't think the frosting tasted like butter pecan or did the cinnamon roll taste like a cinnamon roll. The frosting actually had a overpowering flavor that taste of chemicals. Didn't watch  the shark tank episode when this company appeared on, so I didn't know it was all vegan til I looked it up. I'm not vegan so I'll stick with the eggs and milk they put in at Cinnabon"}
{"text":"Customizable Cinnamon Rolls? Why hasn't this been done before!? I feel like this should have been invented already?!... Anyways, I had the Pumpkin Spice (yep, I am basic) with pecans and my husband had the cookies and cream.... YUMMMM! A little pricey and the menu is a little overwhelming at first, but the service was great and the cinnamon rolls were delicious. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I went opening weekend and the line was wrapped around inside. (as expected) I waited about 30 minutes in line.  The ordering system they have set up seemed pretty efficient as I got my cinnamon buns in less than 5 minutes after I ordered! (And fresh out the oven)   It seemed if an order had an extended wait, it was because the buns were baking.  I got a tub of cookie dough out the fridge they have, two custom cinnamon buns and a cup of oat milk. (I wanted unsweetened almond milk but they only have sweetened or chocolate option for almond)  (I am not vegan, by the way) I thought the buns were good, just a bit dry.  I was a bit disappointed because the buns were so hot and I was ready for a nice warm moist bite!!   I built my bun with Horchata frosting and topped it with almonds and blue berries.  The Horchata frosting was amazing!  The second bun in my party had regular frosting with caramel syrup and brownie bites. It was very sweet to me, but I don't normally get caramel things. The cookie dough seemed sweet to me as well.  The staff was friendly. Almost everyone thanked me for waiting and stopping by.  I had a 40 minute drive - don't think I'll get a craving and feel the need to out my way to come by but if I'm ever on that side of town again - count me in! (I love cinnamon rolls)"}
{"text":"I didn't exactly know how to rate my experience through stars but if the customer service didn't seem so mediocre I probably would have gave it a 3. From the time my mom and I walked in there was no friendly greeting, \"have you folks been here before?!\" Or \"let me walk you through the menu so you can see how this works\" (not that it wasn't self explanatory but YOU NEVER ASSUME!)  You can't just assume everyone has been there before this was our first time in too and we were genuinely excited to try this place because of the reviews. I felt like we interrupted him from doing something or completing an order. We weren't in a rush because we were sitting down \"enjoying\" our rolls.   Now let's get to the rolls. They looked delicious from the case. I got a Rocky Road and my mom got a Coconut Creme Pie. My mom said her roll was hard and my roll was honestly just barely warm in some spots. They both were wayyyy to sweet and my roll looked liked all the toppings were just slapped together. Honestly the experience ruined the taste of the rolls the most. Which made me feel distraught....  When you work in the customer service industry at least take pride in your work and/or pretend like you want to service the people you're serving....not every person is going to be satisfied but don't work if you don't want to put your best foot forward or try to.   I wish we could have at least enjoyed the rolls but definitely not the case."}
{"text":"This place is yummy! You are able to pick your frosting your toppings to put on your cinnamon bun to create an amazing, delicious bun!   I decided to go with peanut butter frosting with cookie dough on top. I highly recommend this combo. The cookie dough was amazing!!  The bun is pretty big so it's perfect for sharing.   Great place for dessert, or dessert for breakfast"}
{"text":"I went with a friend and we thought these buns were delish ! My number one stop now when I have a sweet tooth. Great service, good vibes, satisfied sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a location closer to my house since the one up in Summerlin was so delicious but far. Sad to say the quality has gone down in comparison to what I was used to, maybe it's just this location? I came in at 4pm on a weekday and both the cinnamon buns I ordered were stiff, not the soft doughy texture I was expecting, like they gave us yesterday's batch. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Everything you want a Cinnabon to be!! And I would have never known they were vegan! So delicious!! They have great toppings and buns, every time I go I try something different and it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic.  Friendly and quick.  Pricing was decent.     My husband ordered pancake frosting, with cookie dough and brownie bites.  His was pretty tasty.  I got one with half macadamia/ half tiramisu.  No toppings.  This was not so good.  Had a distinct taste of alcohol (similar to the taste if vanilla extracts) I took a bite of each side and tossed the rest.    The rolls themselves were ok...nothing special. For some reason I expected them to be warm...(just the  frosting was warm, not the roll). The roll wasnt hard but it wasnt super soft either (i personally like super soft and fluffy rolls)  All in all, not worth the 30 min drive and $12 price tag.  If I was in the area and desperately craving a cinna roll I might stop by and try the plain cream cheese frosting with strawberries.    i Should've kept it simple. Oh well, live and learn."}
{"text":"OMG!! The people before us opened the door to this place and out came that sweet cinnamon smell! Love this place! One of my (not so) guilty pleasures here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very impressed! I had passed this place a couple of times knowing they were a newer non-cinnabon establishment. What I didn't know was that it was 100% vegan...what a shock since there was a menu full of different frosting and toppings to customize your cinnamon roll, along with their pre-made selections. Single cinnamon rolls range from $5-6 and have the circumference of a softball, but they have mini rolls that are cheaper. As expected, it is a very indulgent tasting treat, a bit on the sweet side for me but are nonetheless delicious (I got a tiramisu roll); I am certain you can get the frosting amount adjusted per your request. As others have stated in previous reviews, service wasn't spectacular not because I didn't get my food quickly, but because the person behind the register seemed a bit unhappy to be there in general. Other than that, I would love to take some friends of mine who are vegan here so they can enjoy a once in a blue moon treat."}
{"text":"All vegan is what dragged me in, but we will be back because the cookie monster and banana foster cinnamon rolls are amazing. Even the cookies were hands down the best I'd ever purchased."}
{"text":"I am not vegan. I was surprised that the cinnamon roll was as tasty as it was. A bit too sweet for me (i had the cookie monster) after a long bad day. It certainly worked for that. Next visit, I'll get something with fruit."}
{"text":"The staffer in the store was very nice and helpful. I had the caramel coffee cake one and it was good! My friend got the old school one and she agreed that mine was better. These are pretty pricey and super sweet. While the taste is great for being all vegan, I'm not sure I liked it enough to come back often. It is maybe a once-a-year kind of treat."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I have a sweet craving and oh does it satisfy! The Twix, Peanut Butter Cup, monster.... soooooo good! Not enough words to describe how tasty! My eyes are always bigger than my stomach so I order from here through Grub Hub. It might be too dangerous if I enter- I want to try them all!!!! You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Overkill on the white frosting. Threw it in the garbage after couple of bites. How can you eat all that sugar? The rolls were bone dry, took a bite and it crunches."}
{"text":"This place is genius! I've been wanting to try this place because for one it's vegan and two I've been hearing such great things about it before it hit North Carolina. I'm so happy to be able to say we have one. The cinnamon rolls are amazing. You can create your own for a base price of $4.25 and then choice of frosting is .25 cents and each topping is .50 cents. I got the create your own and got the cream cheese frosting with strawberries. The berries were very fresh and the consistency of the frosting was perfect as well as the cinnamon bun melting in your mouth.  The cinnamon roll isn't to rich or sweet, it doesn't cause you to feel full or fell like you overindulge when you normally eat a cinnamon roll. I definitely will be back. They offer cookie dough,and brownies as well. They also have a wild selection drinks as well to wash down your cinnamon bun. Oh and Everything is vegan.   There is a reward system for you to sign up for and you get a free cinnamon bun for your next visit when signing up for loyalty."}
{"text":"Came here today for the soft opening. OMG! So delicious!!!! You start off with the basic cinnamon roll, choose from an array of frosting flavors, and top it off with your favorite toppings. The possibilities here are limitless! I had the macadamia nut frosting topped with coconut, strawberries, blueberries, and banana...reminded me of breakfast in Hawaii. My friends had a coffee hazelnut & walnut roll and a cookie dough drizzle roll. Those were a bit on the heavier side but delicious none the less. Most importantly, everything here is VEGAN!!! I will definitely be coming back here and telling all my friends!"}
{"text":"They've Got Big Buns Hun!  My vegan friend raved about this cute little joint recently so I had to check it out while in the area. Apple GPS was being a hater so I may or may not have passed it up. The sign on the back of the building made it extremely helpful (I'm no quitter though).   The menu is super overwhelming and I probably held up the line asking to sample frosting (Yes I was that girl today)!  I settled for a create your own roll with cream cheese frosting, pecans & caramel. Did I mention it was Vegan? I don't live a plant based lifestyle but I admire this sweet spot for considering my plant based peeps when it comes to yummy treats.   Skip the mini they are cold, (not as fresh) and a waist of $1.75. The create your own roll was a fresh, hot, gooey party in my mouth!  $8+ of course I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Marvin made this experience awesome but I'll be honest I did not buy the idea that I could LOVE a cinnamon roll that was not Cinnabon let alone  VEGAN! However the five stars comes from the fresh made to order peanut butter frosting shot Marvin made for me after he was kind enough to give me a sample of it ..   I'm a frosting gal and honestly my son and Mom usually are the cinnamon roll lovers but man oh man I can't wait to go back and try some of their unique combos ...  The trouble with vegas bakery items in my past are the items are dry but this place knocked it out of the park ..  Be warned the original that we tried was super sweet but Marvin warned us before hand but was so patient and welcoming while we were taking it all in and was super helpful!!   I can't wait till I can find an excuse to go back again soon to try more of the flavors but the vanilla frosting and peanut butter are bomb dot com and the roll was delicious on top of awesome service with smile !"}
{"text":"The girl working was extremely patient with all my questions. Very friendly. The.place is clean and the cinnamon rolls are delicious. My boyfriend and roommate couldn't even tell they were vegan! Great price too!"}
{"text":"This place was on my radar for a couple days so today is the day I conquer Cinnaholic before I leave Vegas. Very friendly cashier that helped me out with my order. I had the Elvis and cream cheese with pecans total for 2 cinnamon rolls was 12 dollars. They taste like regular cinnamon rolls and they claim to be vegan so I had to try. Not to overwhelmingly sweet so that's a plus. 3 stars for friendly staff and vegan cinnamon rolls"}
{"text":"The customer service was awesome ... the cinnamon rolls are awesome.. YOU PICK YOUR OWN TOPPINGS!!! IT IS VEGAN !!! Bad Vegan but still Vegan.. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Too many flavors to try it was so difficult to choose lol I got the marshmallow with blueberries"}
{"text":"These are hands down the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! Highly recommend! Great food and service."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! As a vegan, it is great to get a delicious vegan dessert without going to Lakewood or Cleveland. We hope that this opening and their success will spark veganism to spread to Westlake and Avon even more. We love Avon but wish the vegan population was a little bit more diverse and would spread to these suburban areas.   Now, lets get back to Cinnaholic. We come very often and buy cinnamon rolls, brownies, cookies, and cookie dough which are all vegan. Due to this place not advertising their plant-based fare, some people get confused by the $5 cookie dough among other things, but it is great for vegans! The rolls always taste flavorful, fresh, and warm. The staff, especially Leo and his wife, are always friendly and helpful. We will be coming back very often!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I was already familiar with this business from Shark Tank and I was waiting for the day I could finally sink my teeth into the amazing looking, vegan cinnamon rolls and my prayers have been answered. They opened up this location and I'm already hearing all the buzz about it. Currently  having my 1st roll and WOW is all I can say.  Being a new vegan, these rolls have made me a happy girl. I love cinnamon rolls and can consider myself a master in their taste and these are incredible. They offer various toppings but I'm a basic cinnamon rolls with icing type of gal so I stuck with my usual. Their display of rolls looks delicious, esp the Captain America with peanut butter, strawberries, blueberries and strawberry sauce.  Check out this place and if your gf is a vegan, surprise her with one and she'll love u even more"}
{"text":"Glad we are finally getting different eating establishments in Indian Trail.  Purchased the Cookie Monster roll.  Pretty delicous.  Pretty pricey too at almost $6 a roll with tax.  -1 Star for the whole ordering process.  It doesn't seem to foster quickness, but that could be because they just opened as well.  It's worth trying at least once to see if it's your thing!"}
{"text":"I love that they are vegan. & it's awesome to have so many options to customize your cinnamon roll! The location is nice & it was bright, clean, & spacious inside. Decent prices & friendly staff. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I practically went here almost every other day. I like the staff and they are all nice and helpful people. I have been going here since they opened and I went here enough for all of them to know my name and what I order. The cinnamon rolls here are better than any other place I've had cinnamon rolls. The toppings are great and I usually get cream cheese frosting and chocolate chips. The cookies and brownies are amazing too. If I ever am on that side of town, I would make sure I stop by their place and get something to eat. The problem I had was it was on the other side of town for me and driving there took some time, but worth it every trip. They have a rewards system and for every ten stars you get, you get a free Old Skool roll. I'm positive that I have gotten over 150 stars and probably spent the money just by cookies and cinnamon buns alone. I took my friends here to try it out and they all enjoyed it! They also have a place for you to charge your phone or laptop while you're there. Now that they opened a location right by my house, the Centennial Hills location, I will have to go to the new one for convenience. Although, I would like to visit this location since they all know me already."}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious, bomb, yummmmmy. Too young of people working there but there nice for the most part."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! As a vegan rookie this place defiantly satisfied my sweet tooth. The banana foster is awesome along with all their other premium rolls. All ingredients are vegan friendly and this place mos def helps my transition easy! I recommend anyone to come thru vegan or not!"}
{"text":"Vegan Cinnamon Rolls! Hell yes! Now don't be scared if you are unsure of vegan food. Trust me you'll never know.  Thanks to my friend Emily she took me to Cinnaholic. You can create your very own cinnamon roll by adding your choice of frosting and toppings. They have  fruit, jam, cookie crumbles, and just about anything decadent you can imagine to put on your bun. Plus, it's all vegan so you can feel good about eating it. I love checking out their cinnamon bun of the day. They are also huge so plan on sharing or get two & share both with s friend. Check out their Instagram for different buns daily. I wish they had locations everywhere!"}
{"text":"Tried this shop on a whim when I stopped in for a smoothie next door. This place is cinnamon heaven when you walk through the door! Smells great and cinnamon rolls for days. Their schtick is they sell vegan cinnamon rolls - no eggs and no dairy. I don't know how they've done it but they put out a very good cinnamon roll without them. I took away 1 star because they're not Cinnabon but I'll be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of sweets but this place was amazing. You have so many different flavors of frosting to choose from and so many great toppings to add. We didn't really have to wait very long. The buns come fresh from the oven. We took ours to go and they still tasted delicious!!"}
{"text":"I took the family here for the first time last week.  Business was very clean and well life.  Staff was super friendly and helpful.  The kids loved picking out what they wanted although all the different combinations made it alittle tough for them.  Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The owners are a very thoughtful and everything is so perfectly sweet. I love coming back here as often as possible  Thank you for being in the area!"}
{"text":"Oh...my....heaven. When you want a cheat day, this is a stop you should make. It puts Cinnabon to shame. The rolls are so fresh, soft and loaded with flavor. The amazing thing is, you can add toppings. My favorite is the cookie dough, its a game changer. I've had the brownies too and they are so fudgy! Yum!"}
{"text":"A lot of choices. Really good flavor in the frostings. So many options that you could come everyday and not try all the different flavors. Very casual and calm atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have loads of options and I've definitely tired more then i'm willing to admit! The staff is very upbeat and very nice when I come in. I love the fact that I can have found a good place to have vegan dessert!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god I'm so excited I finally got to come here!literally the coolest concept ever.... With my favorite pastry... THE CINNAMON ROLLL!!!! They're also super huge which is a plus.   The process was easy, pick a icing and toppings. That is it! This hidden gem is located in the shopping center by tropical smoothie on 215 and flamingo. Each cinnamon roll is about $5 which isn't bad at all since its customized. They also have example cinnamon rolls on display if you're an indecisive freak like me. I got the pumpkin spice, horchata, and tiramisu icing on each and a few toppings of my liking.  The spot is super cute. Clear directions, clean, and awesome interior design. Overall... I will be back! I absolutely love this establishment."}
{"text":"This place ha the best cinnamon rolls. The best part is everything here is vegan! They also have amazing raw cookie dough scoops, my favorite is the peanut butter and jelly."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's Vegan! Takes EXACTLY like the real deal, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place, and trust me everything I heard was true. Amazing Cinnamon Rolls with such delicious flavors and creative looks. The overall look inside was very intriguing. The Employees were very nice, As a first timer I usually like to be informed on the product and the Employees did not disappoint. Other than that I really enjoyed it there, you won't be disappointed. Also I got the Cookie Monster and it was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! I have been trying to make better food choices by eating Vegan foods and I didn't know what to expect coming here. The taste of the Cinnamon rolls are amazing and you don't feel like junk eating it like regular cinnamon rolls. I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff. The food was ok. It was kinda doughy and extremely sweet. I'll go back to try their other options."}
{"text":"For how long the wait is, they should give samples really though it was over 30min? . Ok update; so I found out they called my name did not hear it so my cinnamon roll was sitting on a shelf for at least 15min which the girl replied you must not have heard ok great  just see me sitting there waiting. Very annoying experience."}
{"text":"A vegan Cinnamon roll bakery? Yes please! My in-laws live right around the corner and we took the opportunity to try. First, let me tell you the amount of options they allow for a truly customizable cinnamon roll is insane. I never would have thought of eating Oreos or cookie dough on one. The prices are good, especially for the portion you're given. It was clean, fast and the employees working were pleasant. Definitely would go here again next time I have a sweet tooth (surprisingly the cinnamon rolls did not taste terribly sweet- BIG plus). We bought a couple to take home to the family and unsurprisingly they were devoured immediately."}
{"text":"Cinnaholic, you are cinn-fully good! Customizable cinnamon buns are 100% vegan, fun and guilt free!  The combos I've tried are:   - Marshmallow frosting, chocolate chips, chocolate syrup, and graham crackers. This s'mores inspired combo was amazing!  - Cream cheese frosting, strawberries, strawberry jam, chocolate syrup, and pie crust.  Another amazing combo!  I love the variety of frosting and toppings and I can wait to go back and try more combinations! Nothing was too sweet and flavors did not clash.  The texture of the cinnamon roll was soft and pretty good for it being a vegan dessert!    There is a rewards program that is monitored through your phone number. After 10 stars, you get a free old skool!  *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 51/100"}
{"text":"This is an amazing ideas. I wonder why I didn't think of it. Since I love Cinnabon. But to have a fresh bun with whatever icing you want and any toppings you liked. It just genius. So far I have only tried it once. But I need to have some more. But you know I got to get that summer body. But in the winter time I'm going to hit this hard trying one each week."}
{"text":"So happy they opened! Just went in on the first day to check it out after a class at 103... So glad I did! They were the BEST cinnamon rolls... My friends couldn't believe they were vegan! I love the options - as you can just purchase a 'naked' cinnamon roll... Or you can choose your frosting and toppings! I tried a few of the staple ones they had displayed in the case and was so impressed. The best part was they were so fresh. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, some people complain a lot... it's sugar people :) It's not meant to be a \"healthy\" treat by any means. Vegan does NOT equate to healthy! So obviously... anything with sugar is bound to be sweet.   I love having a Cinnaholic close to home. We actually did a run there with our running group (we have done one to the other location in the past) and everyone LOVED it! The new location is much more spacious than the one on Flamingo (which I also frequent). It's basically like Cinnabon but only better since it's a) vegan and b) there are WAY more options!   I've found my favorite frosting so far to be banana. Seriously love it. The marshmallow is also good, along with the original cream cheese. Generally if I don't feel like having a lot, I opt for the baby buns - they are cheap and 2 of those little guys hit the spot!  This is great place that we are lucky to have in Centennial Hills! They are ALWAYS nice when I go in there - but having worked retail in my life... there are good days and bad days for anything. I've never had an issue there and the owner is always super friendly. If you are looking for budget-conscious cinnamon rolls... try the day old ones. They are half price ($2.75 I think!) and they are still just as good the day after they have come out of the oven :)"}
{"text":"Let's welcome Cinnaholic with open arms, for the sinful, sweet-smelling cinnamon rolls!!!  There is nothing like the scent of the hot cinnamon rolls fresh from the oven.  As I walked inside, I could smell the aroma of the bubbling cinnamon, yeast, sugar, and butter. I just about lost my mind, everything looked exquisite, with an extensive topping combination list. My advice before you walk-in just know what your craving whether it's chocolate, fruity, nutty, or salty-sweet then work way up from there.  The rolls are 100% vegan, dairy & lactose free made with high quality ingredients. I was shocked from the flavor coming out of rolls. I eat everything, I don't have any restrictions flavor is my driving force, however I will recommend this place to my Vegan friends.  The service is awesome, Aliscia & Marco are one of the nicest people I've come across, I believe they have as much fun making the rolls, as we do eating them.   Wahoo!! I'm excited this place rocks."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 71/100  If you love Cinnabon, you'll LOVE this place!   Been dying to try this place. I heard a lot of great things about it, and plus, they were on Shark Tank! I told my Hawai'i friends who were visiting about it. So glad they chose this place to get dessert after lunch.    All cinnamon rolls are made fresh daily. I wanted to try the baby buns, but they were still baking it when we got there.   Here, you get to choose your own frosting and toppings. They have a huge list and variety of frostings and toppings to choose from. They also have popular combos in their display case if you have a hard time deciding.   Even though I can't have much sugar and they didn't have the baby buns ready, I opted to get a regular roll with chai frosting and gingersnap cookies! Which is an onoliscious combination. I LOVED IT. The roll is huge! I only ate 1/4 of it. The roll was freshly made and soft. The frosting was seductively oozing down the roll. Yummmm.   I didn't feel a huge sugar spike, so based on my experience I'm assuming it's healthier and has less sugar compared to Cinnabon.    I also appreciated the way it's served if you dine in. A reusable plastic container and thick tissue paper (not sure what they're called) that can easily be packed in a to-go box if you can't finish it. No mess, no fuss. Easy clean up. I love how they use recyclable and compostable to-go boxes and not styrofoam.  My friends LOVED it and said they will come back to bring some home before they leave.   Service was great, helpful and friendly. They also had a big screen tv towards the back with Friends on.   There are only a few places I get cravings for and this is one of them. I will definitely be back! I'll have to pace myself with this one."}
{"text":"Holy cow! I stopped in today after I saw the sign weeks ago. Sooooo happy I did. I got a pb cup cinnamon roll to go so I could share with my boyfriend later.  The store is very clean. When you walk in I got confused and went in the pick up line instead of the order line (oops). The staff was friendly and I was acknowledge right away. They had cinnamon rolls fresh from the oven and the store smelled like heaven.  I picked the pb cup after seeing a display one. So like I said I got this for later. It heated up well in the microwave. It was so delicious. I seriously wish I would've gotten us each or own roll bc one bite and I did not want to share anymore lol. The peanu butter frosting had such good flavor without being sickeningly sweet. The cinnamon roll itself was soft and cinnamony, the perfect bready consistency. Overall it was amazing and I highly recommend! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We go here we more often than we should! It's fantastic. You also would never know they were vegan if they didn't have a little sign about it, you definitely can't tell the difference with the taste. I highly recommend the cookie dough!!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place after dinner tonight. The staff was friendly and the place smelled amazing. They have an array of frostings and toppings to choose from.  I decided to try just a basic cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting and the next time, if there is one, I'd expand my horizons and add from there. The cinnamon roll was baked fresh, right in front of me (major plus).  I got it to go so I had this warm box of goodness sitting in the front seat of my car calling my name. When I finally got home I took my first bite ..... I was so disappointed...... That I didn't stay and eat it there so I could order another one! Absolutely delicious. I will be back sometime this week to get more creative with my next cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"This location frequently sells out of cinnamon rolls later at night and because of this, will close the store before its scheduled close time. Best to call ahead to check stock if visiting during later hours, especially between 9pm - 10pm."}
{"text":"Amazing, yummy, scrumptious. Loads of topping options including fresh fruit, and the cookie dough is a must! They are very friendly and totally explain everything. Love the charging stations at the table."}
{"text":"HOLY CINAMOLY!  I love this place. I have gone 3 times already and I wanted to see if it would change!  I would take the 40 min drive just for this place!"}
{"text":"The original with almonds and walnuts was AMAZING!!! Price is pretty good too! I think they start at $4.99 and each topping is like $0.50. Perfect place to treat yourself if you have a sweet tooth! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Cinnaholic. Josie has been wanting to try this for a while so I gave in and joined her in satisfying her sweet tooth. I got the Butterscotch and she got the regular normal one. I will say that the butterscotch was amazing. was not as sweet as I was expecting but aslo had a savory aspect to it. The dough is great for my Diabetic situation even if the sugar was not. The bun practically melted in our mouths. What can I say it was simple yummy. The staff was patient and helpful and the wait was not long even though they were quite busy. Thank you for stopping by Cinnaholic. We will go here again, and just recently tried the one in Henderson. Want to satisfy a sweets craving? Check these guys out"}
{"text":"Ok so this place is 100 percent vegan, despite that not being very obvious. Small signage. Place is very modern and clean- tons of special rolls with a good variety. Raspberry truffle was awesome and the classic roll was just as good. Overall very happy with my first vegan 'dessert' experience. Will definitely go back when the craving hits- no more cinnabon. 4.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"This place was delicious and also great customer service they have many frosting flavored to choose from and a verity of toppings to put on!!"}
{"text":"Worth The Wait!  Vegans Rejoice!  This spot was everything you hoped for and more.  Deliciousness overload with these create your own cinnamon rolls.  We tried the peanut butter frosting with banana topping.  We also tried the banana cream frosting with banana & caramel sauce topping.  The lattes are even Vegan, you can chose from almond or soy milk.  It is worth the drive...definitely a great spot for breakfast or dessert.  Follow me @ #foodievida on Facebook and Instagram for more of my foodie adventures."}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday night when the boyfriend and I were craving something sweet. We were greeted and served immediately. Staff was accommodating and friendly and not to mention helpful with the menu. I created my own and the bf had the \"turtle\" they were both delicious!! The atmosphere is lit as well.. will definitely come back when my sweet tooth is calling for a snack!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming... I love cinnamon rolls but every time I've come here I've been disappointed. The first time, I got the original cinnamon roll. You can't go wrong with the original. Except.. the icing tasted like pure butter!! I'm from the south--I like butter, but this was plain gross. I couldn't force myself to eat it. The roll itself was also a bit dry. The second time, I got lemon icing with fresh blueberries on top. This one was a bit better as it thankfully didn't taste like butter, but like last time, the roll was dry. The icing also wasn't impressive either. My sister has made cinnamon rolls from scratch and these unfortunately don't compare :("}
{"text":"Cinnamon rolls are my all time FAVORITE dessert, so of course I had to check this place out as soon as I found out about it. Not only was I greeted by friendly staff, but their cinnamon rolls were amazing! I got cream cheese frosting with strawberries. I'll definitely be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I heard about this place so I decided to give it a chance and boy was it a good decision. Atmosphere was great and the cinnamon rolls (Captain America) was amazing. I'll be back tomorrow. I ended up meeting the owner too who's a cool ass dude. I definitely recommend coming here for any reason at all. I guarantee you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this location and it was amazing to say the least. I'm addicted to this place and I keep bringing all of my friends. They really have something for everyone and anything you order will be more than exceptional. Give it a try you won't be disappointed I guarantee it."}
{"text":"By far the BEST cinnamon bun I have ever had! It is very very sweet so if you don't like super sweet then this place won't be or you but if you do then this place is for you!!! We got cake batter frosting with cookie dough topping!!!! DAAAAANNNNKKK"}
{"text":"This is a novel alternative for a treat.  The presentation is off the chart and the rolls smell and taste great.  So many different options make the experience unique each time.  My family and I simply enjoyed what this new place has to offer.  Great job and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Love!!! Get the groupon deal and enjoy! My only complaint is that it's located right across from my yoga studio"}
{"text":"Omg this place is absolutely delicious!!!! My favorite dessert place in town...and it's cruelty free"}
{"text":"Had the traditional cinnamon roll and I was in heaven. Soooo good, so warm and buttery which makes it hard to believe it's vegan!!!. Can't believe it was my first time here! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I can definitely say I'm a cinnaholic. They are extremely addicting every time I come I get peanut butter frosting with cookie dough and strawberry jam. It's the best pj and j ever created. It was a recommendation on my first visit and haven't changed it since. They should replace Cinnabon in all malls with Cinnaholic."}
{"text":"Great food, Old Skool is my favorite by far but I like the simplicity. The staff are very friendly and easy to work with for all your needs."}
{"text":"Best alternative to Cina B at the mall.  It's not as sweet, and if you hate going to the mall, Cinnaholic is the place for you. There's tons of choices and toppings you can select from that if you can eat there daily, It would still take months to try all of the different combos.  And take my word, your MD or wife wouldn't like It very much if you ate there daily.  Overall, the choices, cleanliness, and tastes of Cinnaholic is a must try... but only once a month unless you're looking forward to the triple bypass experience.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable, if you thought Cinnabon is good, you haven't had a real cinnamon roll with flavor potential Endless toppings, flavors and in house gourmet cookies are outstanding! Great job guys cookies n cream with marshmellow frosting is a must try! Hands down best place to get a gourmet cinnamon roll and have options with 5 star flavor"}
{"text":"Having a Cinnaholic so close to home is downright dangerous. As one of my friends told me as I gushed over my excitement of the grand opening last week, I'm probably going to get fat (or at least put on a few extra pounds). The only thing that saved me before was the fact that the older location was way across town. There's no saving me now.   Of course I have to give a vegan shout out. Do you know how rare it is to find vegan baked goods? Harder than it should be, that's for damn sure. The rolls are warm, fluffy, and deliciously sweet. I tried the cookie monster and loved the icing, but the cookies were a bit hard for my liking. It's best to go with the cookie dough. The roll is best shared between two people. Whenever I try to eat a roll myself I feel uncomfortably full (but sooo satisfied).   Service is a bit lackluster. We waited about 15 minutes for a specialty roll and the cashier was pretty unenthusiastic. This newer location is spacier which is nice. For a specialty roll and a smart water, the bill came out to ~$7. I'll definitely come back, probably at least once a week. :)  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #4"}
{"text":"It was almost immediately upon Cinnaholic's announcement of impending Las Vegas arrival that an e-mail was sent to corporate, a refusal to answer inquiries about Ingredients save for \"proprietary\" since expanded to a lengthy list on the website confirming suspicions that little is \"natural\" about the their Vegan Cinnamon Rolls but recent comments from a local Chef enough to justify a visit...if only to see for oneself if it was really as bad as suggested.  Now open for a year in The Mall at Grand Canyon with additional outposts in Henderson and Centennial, a win on the television program \"Shark Tank\" apparently enough to take an idea for DIY-Cinnamon Rolls mainstream, it was just past two o'clock that the small store was found to be empty, a smell of Cinnamon in the air and two young women quickly offering greetings with smiles on their faces.  In reality a simple concept not dissimilar to Fro-yo or Shaved Ice, fresh Baked Cinnabuns ready to be crowned with Frosting plus a vast array of toppings, guests at Cinnaholic are welcome to choose from over forty suggested varieties or build their own piece-by-piece, the former seemingly best to see how their ideas fare and one Bun selected to personal preference while the other was deferred to the servers.  Not a spot where one should expect to wait long, the \"Straight from the Oven\" slogan on a back wall sort of misleading as previously baked Rolls behind the counter are visibly extracted from a warmer, it was with The Rugrats playing on a television that two non-Cinnamon Roll options were tasted while waiting just five minutes, the Chocolate Chip Cookie lacking any crispiness much like Chewy Chips Ahoy while Cinnaholic's Brownie fares far better, the dense fudgey square one of Sin City's best and a deal at just $2.50.  Setting aside more than half of the Cookie and Brownie as Cinnamon Rolls were passed across the counter, one for now and another for later, it was with mild amusement that claims from others about the Dough appearing 'raw' were confirmed upon cutting into the \"Nutty Professor,\" a topping of what tasted more like Salty Caramel than \"Butterscotch\" pleasantly mellowed by toasted Nuts but the texture and color beneath not dissimilar from Wonderbread and thus off-putting, an identical situation found in the \"Crunchy PB & J\" which, although edible, does not justify the price compared to Cinnabon let alone better Cinnamon Rolls found elsewhere.  **Generally put off by eateries that hide behind claims of \"Vegan\" as though it means healthy, the fact that *most* should realize a Cinnamon Roll is never anything but an indulgence, it is more Cinnaholic's base that makes their product unappealing and in a city with the likes of CRAFTkitchen, Mothership, Joe Maxx and others making great Vegan Baked Goods there is really no reason to go here save for perhaps a Brownie or desire to watch Rugrats."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter if you're a carnivore or vegan, this place is lit! Most folks probably don't even realize that this is a vegan establishment.   The prices are affordable, and they have a great rewards program. Maybe that's why I've been here everyday for the last week?!  I understand that they are known for their cinnamon roll, which are SO good but massive. Instead, I opt for the chocolate chip cookie dough. My family attempted to do an intervention tonight, but I've got to get my fix. The cookie dough tastes just like the real thing. Sometimes, I even splurge and get the s'mores cookie dough. Cinnaholic has turned me into a cookie dougholic!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Basically you have a cinnamon roll and are able to customize it with toppings and different flavors of frosting. I personally like the original cinnamon roll without any toppings. My favorite thing here is the vegan cookie dough. It is made without eggs so you're able to eat it without the risk of getting salmonella poisoning! You're also able to get the cookie dough as a topping on the cinnamon roll or you can get a container to go! The container of cookie dough doesn't last longer than a day in my household. People who are scared of vegan food will not be scared of this place. Everything tastes amazing and you would never know it is vegan.  The service is great. Love everything about this place and definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for a sweet snack."}
{"text":"I think of this place like cold stone but with cinnamon rolls!  When you walk in you are greeted with the sweet smell of fresh baked cinnamon rolls, what's better than that?  The display case provides suggestions for combination or you can get creative yourself.   The size is definitely shareable, as I often split one with my sister.  I love how it's not overly sweet. Would never have guessed that everything is vegan!  It's so difficult to drive past this place when I go to target!  Watch out though... like a kid a candy store it can get pricy with all the possibly topping choices as you are charged per topping and if you want a frosting other than vanilla."}
{"text":"Amazing cinnamon rolls! Best I've ever had, will defanatly be going back. I only wish they had more coffee choices!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING! This is my new go-to Sweet Spot! I have been vegan for over a year and have had a cinnamon roll craving for months! Cinnaholic not only satisfied my craving, but now I am OBSESSED. I can't stop thinking about my next cinnaholic custom cinnamon roll. I am so happy this place is 100% vegan. I really hope they open a spot in Henderson!"}
{"text":"My go-to sweet treat spot! The staff is always friendly and the service is quick! sooo yummy. Glad all of the treats are 100% vegan! I will be back for my next sweets craving!"}
{"text":"I was craving something sweet and there's so much 90s nostalgia going on and it reminds me of checkin' out dudes as a teenager at the Meadows Mall which made me think of Cinnabon! Ahh, memories...  Low and behold, Cinnaholic. It's like Cinnabon on crack. You have there OG cinnamon roll and it tastes just like a Cinnabon and it's cruelty free! Holla!!!! They also have signature combinations like s'mores and whatnot and they have season specials as well.  Where this place kicks it up a notch is the toppings! So many choices! They've got different frostings and toppings. They're all egg and dairy free. They're loaded with gluten and their stuff is made on shared equipment with nuts.  In making my selection, I got the roll with peanut butter frosting and raspberry jam. It was heaven.  My only ding is buying coffee. I ordered it and it was a prepackaged latte. If I would have know that, I wouldn't have gotten on. Lesson learned. Also, get an espresso machine.   This location was clean and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Cinnaholic today.  Brand new location in the smiths shopping center.  The place is clean.  Service was friendly but didn't really guide us with any tips.  It was our 1st time and my mini wasn't sure what she wanted or how it worked and the worker kind of just stood there and waited for us to order.  My mini ended up getting the cinnamon roll with raspberry frosting and sprinkles.   We were luck y and the cinnamon rolls were hot and fresh out of the oven!  Yes!!! Being vegan was a big draw for me.  Try to be a bit healthier since the cinnamon roll are so glutinous.   Cinnamon roll was nice and fluffy.  A bit bland but I guess that's bc of the toppings etc added?   Either way we will be back to try more.  Easier than going into the mall for Cinnabon."}
{"text":"Sooooo fire. The Cookie Monster is the look. Marshmallow frosting. Also like the raspberry frosting. Great service."}
{"text":"Honestly, their buns are overrated. The center of the buns are dry and not gooey, sticky, but it is sugary"}
{"text":"Words cant describe the yumminess! You just have to try them yourself!! Im hooked after one purchase......and Im freaked out because this place is 2 blocks from my house. God help me resist buying these cinnamon rolls on a daily basis...."}
{"text":"My cinnamon roll tasted amazing! I got the chai frosting and almond topping... kept it simple enough. I would definitely come back for more if I wanted to splurge and was craving it as it does cost almost $6 a roll! It was a big cinnamon roll and I was able to share with my boyfriend :)   The store was clean. No customers on a Saturday afternoon and we were greeted right away. The guy there told us a little bit about the menu and their cinnamon rolls and recommended we try the original as it was our first time there. Cinnamon roll took about 3 mins to be made and we were on our merry way."}
{"text":"Everything thing here is good. They're hand-crafted custom cinnamon rolls. What's not to love? You have different frosting flavors and different toppings to choose from. So far I've had orange flavored frosting with blueberries and lemon flavored frosting with raspberries. They have a Captain America, blueberry pie, s'mores, caramel  mocha latte, Samoa flavored cinnamon roll, and many other flavors."}
{"text":"They have a nice display of rolls when you walk in. In it is a couple of their special roll. I'm assuming they are fake because the one you order is made fresh. They have plenty of choices to customize your cinnamon roll or you can pick one of their special roll off of the menu that's taped to the counter. It takes about five minutes for it to be ready. I did go there when they were slow. The rolls were delicious. They were warm and soft. The frosting and toppings were fresh. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place. Everything there is phenomenal!So many options to chose from, a lot of yummy combinations you can make! The home made vegan cookie dough is to die for!!!! I never share when it comes to that lol only con is its sooooo far away. I think they're opening a location on or near by the strip. If they do, they'll have a new regular customer!"}
{"text":"Recently on this side of town I heard and old favorite of mine opened so naturally I had to get my dessert fix. Walking in I was greeted immediately, the menu was slightly different then the other one so they explained everything to me which was very helpful. I'm a huge peanut butter guy, went with the Elvis you won't be disappointed peanut butter frosting, bananas and chocolate sauce yum. Must say this one is designed far better then the summerlin location stained concrete, reclaimed wood. Good job cinnaholic I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Brought my husband here for the first time during a short trip to Vegas. Worth the uber!! Took one to go too. Vanilla frosting is my favorite but my husband got chai frosting with almonds and that was good too."}
{"text":"Cinnaholic is HEAVEN!! Angels work there, so heavenly delish!      Was able to get samples of the frosting flavors, because I practically wanted one of everything - they ALL looked so YUMMY!!!     Service was superb!      Thank you for being close to home Cinnaholic - was such perfect timing!"}
{"text":"I like a good old fashioned cinnamon roll, I had to try these but kept thinking are they using all these different toppings to hide a crappy pastry? So I went with something pretty simple, Carmel frosting with walnuts, the cinnamon roll was soft and fresh, I like to \"unwrap\" my cinnamon roll and eat from the outside in, it was just as delicious on the outside as it was on the inside. I liked the carmel frosting, not overly sweet.  It was a nice size too. My only complaint was that the walnuts were too \"whole\", they needed to be crushed up a bit more. I'm not sure of the one my husband got but it was a messy one! Had pieces of brownie on top and chocolate sauce, he loved it though, said he'd get it again. Our big disappointment was with customer service, I read all these great reviews about how friendly they were but the girl that waited on us was not great. It felt like we were bothering her, it was an effort to answer our questions. My husband ended up adding on a cup of coffee, which both carafes were empty when he tried them. Finally a guy from the back helped him out and filled them but the coffee was bad and had coffee ground floating in it. I would definitely go back for the cinnamon rolls, its what they are known for. Their name isn't Coffeeholic or Happyholic!"}
{"text":"Omg The cinnamon rolls are so delicious I love the cookie dough on top that homemade cookie dough is the best ever!!! If you haven't tried cinnaholic then hurry over there because oh my God these cinnamon rolls are the best thing I have ever tasted!!!"}
{"text":"Oh boy!!!! Here we go again. About to dig in to the sweetest, tastiest, most delicious vegan cinnamon roll of all time. I'm having the good ole standard old school cinnamon roll today. As always this bad boys sweet and creaminess is off the charts. It's hard to finish it in one sitting but it's just as hard to not.    The kids working the counter were nice and friendly as always. Quick happy service. Delicious. Sweet. Awesome and vegan.   Thanks guys!!! Keep up the great service and treats."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. What a disappointed. I asked for 2 cinnamon rolls with caramel and pecans. I waited 25 minutes then I discovered that they didn't know where my order was. I waited another 10 minutes and they gave me my order wrong. Besides that the cinnamon rolls were too sweet!!  Not at all cinnamony."}
{"text":"Ho-ly buns.  I have been on the look out for a savory, vegan dessert since quitting dairy back in January. (I can't eat it for health reasons.) Most places I've found either have really plain, gross, desserts, or are extremely expensive. I saw Cinnaholic on Yelp, and decided to give it a shot.  I was so impressed! I got a cinnamon roll with tiramisu frosting and cookie dough on top...omg....so good! I ended up sharing it with my fiance because I knew I could not handle eating all the sugar by myself. The roll was delicious, and I could not tell it was vegan. My roll cost me about $5.50, but I could see how it could easily get more expensive with the more toppings you add. But, since this roll fed two people, I thought it was well worth the money.  The girl working the front desk was super sweet and recommended me her favorites. I joined their rewards programming, because I am DEFINITELY going back - soon!"}
{"text":"Just had the basic cinnamon roll- which was okay for being vegan, however, totally not worth $5. So over priced for what it is. Definitely won't be coming back but at least we tried it."}
{"text":"CinnaHOLIC, for sure! They have a variety of great already made cinnamon rolls or you can build your own.   They also do a rewards program if you're a regular. #BENEFITS   I made a custom made order and tried their caramel frosting with pecans on top. I wanted to try it out since I've always loved cinnamon pecan roll from Cinnabon, but unfortunately it was nothing like it.   It tasted okay, but expected the pecans to be candied and bigger in size, not chopped up in tiny pieces. The sweetness was a little much, but make sure you drink a lot of water with it otherwise you'll get cottonmouth.   Overall they had a great playlist playing and brought back old school memories!"}
{"text":"Omg best vegan cinnamon rolls they have so many kind there amazing you can also customize your cinnamon roll to your likings so much fun"}
{"text":"I've passed Cinnaholic multiple times always fantasizing about them buns. I finally decided to give in. I was feeling quite lazy at the moment so I ordered delivery through yelp. I ordered the Banana foster roll and the coconut cream pie roll. The order came about 20 minutes earlier than the estimated delivery time! The rolls arrived nice and warm and they smelled ahhhhhmazing. After just one bite I knew that this was the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. The flavors are good and the roll is not overly sweet. These rolls are way better than the mall Cinnabon rolls I grew up on that can be sickening sweet. And I read that they're vegan? I may have to try other vegan foods!"}
{"text":"Best cinnamon rolls! So many to choose from. So awesome Vegas a Cinnaholic. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I got the classic and it was fresh out of the oven. Warm & gooey with lots of frosting!! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time recently, and we loved it! We liked how you could build your own cinnamon roll, or choose from specialty ones. It's better than the typical \"go out for ice cream\" dessert. We couldn't believe it was Vegan with how authentic they tasted. We'll definitely be back when it's time for a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"The cinnabons are light & fluffy & HUGE! They also offer baby buns if you want something smaller. Prices are a little expensive."}
{"text":"This place is heaven! An oversized cinnamon bun topped with whatever you want?!?! I fought my fiance for touching mine, it is that good."}
{"text":"If you're having a bad day, go to Cinnaholic. If you're having a mid-life crisis, go to Cinnaholic. If you wake up feeling like there's a part of you that's missing, go to Cinnaholic.   I celebrated my 11-month Vegan-aversary by driving to this glorious place in Westlake. I walked in greeted by the sweet smell of heaven on Earth. I was instantly greeted by some of the most genuine smiles I've ever seen. My hands were shaking with excitement and drool was practically dripping out of my mouth. Too much? Nah, you'll understand.   I chose the BYO option and got peanut butter frosting with peanut butter cups, chocolate sauce, and brownie pieces. My omni sister chose the cream cheese frosting and strawberries. I picked out brownies and cookies to accompany me home so that when I wake up at midnight I have many delicious treats to choose from.   We sat down and opened our boxes. The cinnamon rolls were warm, graciously topped with our choices, and baked to perfection. My sister said she doesn't even like cinnamon rolls but she wants to come back because these surpassed any cinnamon roll she has ever had. They melt in your mouth and each bite just makes you want more. The plethora of frosting and topping choices make it so you have endless possibilities for your own special combination.   Having a cinnamon roll from Cinnaholic is life-changing and once you try it, you'll remember this Yelp review and think \"damn, that crazy vegan was right.\""}
{"text":"When i walked in , i was kinda confused on how everything works, so i asked the girl at the counter which one she recommends, and she told me the Banana Cream Pie was good, and i DID NOT REGRET GETTING IT. It was so good , the crumbs were tastful and the cinnamon bun was soft and just melts in your mouth. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Update: I am so very impressed with the quick response I received by Cinnaholic. They reached out to me personally and made things right. They credited me back the amount that was incorrect with my order. I am looking forward to the next time I try the place out and hope for a better experience!"}
{"text":"\"Who doesn't love a fresh cinnamon roll straight from the oven?\" I visited the branch in the northwest side of town. If you love cinnamon rolls and are craving something sweet, you'll love this spot. You can make your own rolls by choosing your own frosting and toppings or you can choose from their signature rolls. From the FAQ section on their website, they make new cinnamon rolls every 20 minutes to ensure freshness. They made our order super fast - impressive. We ordered 5 cinnamon rolls and they were done in exactly 9 minutes. For 5 rolls, the total came out to a little over $28. I would totally come back to this place to satisfy my sweet tooth cinnamon roll cravings!"}
{"text":"Vegan. Custom. Sweet. Savory.   It's nearly impossible for me to give less than five stars to an all vegan dessert establishment. Im told cinnaholic was on shark Tank and I must say if I had seen the pitch I too would have bought in.   When you walk in the space is small but it's really all they need. You get the option to build your own cinnamon bun with choices in your icing and then your toppings. I sing options include peanut butter, Carmel, almond, orange glaze, vanilla, chocolate, mint, cream, strawberry, cream cheese... You get the picture. Now we're onto the toppings and that list is even longer than you can imagine from Oreos to nuts, from sweet things to salty things you take your pick. You will have a fear of making a bad decision, but I just don't think it's possible!   They also offer healthy dairy free drink options, teas and coffee... I have a mad amount of respect for companies that don't push sodas.   If you're living in Charlotte and your curious if this place is worth the drive the answer is yes and if you need a friend to go with you I'll gladly meet you there... It's so good and I am a vegan with a raging sweet tooth so how can I not love as good vegan cinnamon bun?!"}
{"text":"Best cinnamon roll i had, i got mine with their homemade cookie dough. Highly recommend this one!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. They even have mini ones however you have to catch them when they are coming out of oven. You can make your own Concoction on them. Better than Cinnabon!"}
{"text":"By far these are the best cinnamon rolls we've had in years! The menu is overwhelming! Pick your icing, pick toppings & BAM! Instant calorie overload!  This will definitely be in our rotation. Friendly staff, amazing scent when you walk in & delicious food!"}
{"text":"Ordered a baby bun with vanilla frosting and a cream cheese with walnut roll. The baby bun was very good it had a lot of frosting, the other one didn't have enough frosting. Pretty good though."}
{"text":"The location is clean and the staff is nice and fast. Most everything tastes great! The hours are a bit odd and the caramel sauce was not good, but those are minor because everything else I've tried is excellent. Specifically the cookie dough and cream cheese buns. Glad this place exists. It is a bit pricy, but I do feel it's worth it for a treat."}
{"text":"Yummy vegan cinnamon rolls! I'm a sucker for vegan desserts. And this place blew me away. The staff were friendly too. How awesome is it that you get to chose your flavor of icing and toppings!"}
{"text":"Went today and the girl working wasn't very friendly. I looked at the menu for a bit and was a little overwhelmed with the intensity of them. I ended up just settling for the baby buns which are just three tiny, pre packaged cinnamon buns with your choice of pre packaged icing for $5. They were good but nothing to rave about- then again I did get the most basic thing they offer. The other items on the menu and in the display did look good and I'm sure they're phenomenal... but the vibe from the worker was that I was annoying her and in her way. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is rated so high besides it being Vegan. The cinnamon taste is sooo weak I'm not certain anyone knows what real cinnamon tastes like. And then they cover it up with sugary toppings...because ya know cinnamon rolls aren't fattening if they're Vegan I guess, and everybody loves this. I got a plain ol cinnamon roll w cream cheese frosting to try them out and will never return; no real cinnamon taste and the frosting didn't even taste like cream cheese. Local bakeries do them better, you just have to try to find good food. Not follow trendy Shark Tank businesses. Their perk? is that they have a reward program if you actually like their rolls."}
{"text":"Everything was great, the ladys working were awesome with great smiles and the cinnabuns were delicious but I think there were 4 guys in the back with music very loud, they look to be drunk or just acting obnoxiously that made me wanna get out of there quickly as possible. I think one of them worked there but other than that great place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in one week (if that doesn't say something already). We came in at around 7pm on a Tuesday night. We were the only ones there! Besides the lovely employees. We were greeted upon arrival with a friendly hello and an explanation of how everything worked.  Basically, you pick your flavored icing and topping for your cinnamon roll off a board they have on the wall. I went with the amaretto icing and raspberries as a topping. The gentleman making the rolls asked if we wanted to wait for fresh rolls, which we did! (6 minutes).  The rolls were warm and delicious. The amaretto icing was wonderful with the raspberries. I was incredibly satisfied. So much so that I brought in more family the next morning to try it out!  The staff is polite and the rolls are delicious. Keep in mind each roll is $5-$6. You can also buy cinnamon roll cakes! Fun place. Will be back!"}
{"text":"It used to be a more than 30-hour drive from my hometown of St. Louis, MO, to the Cinnaholic store in Berkeley, CA. Now I can get amazing vegan buns in just 4 hours from my current location! I drove up this weekend and made this my very first stop upon entering the city.   It's a bit hidden within a large strip mall development, but it was fairly easy to find.   They had about 27 base flavors and nearly 20 toppings for you to mix and match.  If you're not in a create-your-own mood, you can choose one of the specials showcased in their display case.  You can also get a plain cinnamon bun, if you're into that sort of thing.   Chocolate chip cookies, brownies, and cookie dough were also available for purchase.  I got a Cotton Candy bun and a Butter Pecan bun, and my DD got a strawberry one.  They came out warm, soft, and tasty.  These buttery buns rival and beat all other; yes, even the non-vegan ones!  Cinnaholic proves that deliciousness can be cruelty-free! I am very happy to have them so much closer to me, and cheers to continuous expansion!"}
{"text":"Vegan cinnamon rolls?! Count me in!! My bf & I have been going here for a while and what keeps us coming back is how delicious their \"Old Skool\" Roll is, which is just their basic cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting on top. We are huge Cinnabon lovers and this place definitely fills in the void and the fact that it's vegan is even more of a bonus! We have tried their other rolls like their Cookies & Cream and Banana Foster but were WAY too sweet for our liking, so we just stick with the straight up, no fuss Old Skool Roll.   I do love the concept of the place and how you can make your own custom cinnamon roll by selecting your frosting (25 cents each) and your toppings (50 cents each) and they have a ton of choices! They also have other baked goods like cookies, brownies, etc. Also, they have a rewards system where you put in your phone number which is super convenient instead of having a stamp card. But I do warn that if you use their Yelp check in offer for 5% off your order and it's less than $5, your points don't count which is a bummer (I wish they told me beforehand).   I do agree with other reviews that this place is pretty pricey for just a cinnamon roll but definitely give it a try if you're looking for something new and sweet to eat!"}
{"text":"Great cinnamon rolls...but the coffee situation was VERY disappointing!  I went in expecting a delicious hot coffee w my warm cinnamon roll.  Only regular coffee and SOY MILK for creamer?!  Sad."}
{"text":"Its vegan, it's delicious and they have good prices. This place is genius and super tasty!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here from Henderson twice. Let me tell you. It is worth the trip, every. Time. For those of you interested, their entire menu is vegan. All their flavors are superb! My favorite of course is the pumpkin icing cinnamon roll. They have plenty of items to choose from. You can make ANY combination of ANY item! So dope! For anyone watching their macros, I suggest trying one item at a time. So one visit, one item. Because if you get more than ONE thing you WILL eat it haha. Staff is always friendly, you may also sit inside or outside. Extremely clean establishment! Love this place and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place... and have been a loyal customer for years. I have been going to their location on Flamingo/215 way before this one ever opened. I was excited that one was opening on my side of town, but sadly I am not a fan of this location whatsoever. The staff here is beyond rude and always seems to have an attitude. To top it off, lately the staff has began to LIE and tell me and other customers on multiple occasions that they are \"all out of cinnamon rolls\" when it's getting close to closing time because they are being lazy and don't want to make any more, which is unacceptable. The other Cinnaholic locations have told me that this is not a thing and that they should never \"run out\". Not only did they lose multiple large orders tonight, they also lost a few loyal customers since they clearly don't want our business!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I like  the food here. The first time I came here I had ordered over the phone and I could barely understand the guy taking my order and he just hung up on me and didn't ask for a name or repeat my order. When I picked up my food I realized it was just the guy working not anything wrong with the connection of the phone. He didn't offer good customer service so I got turned off of the place immediately. I gave the place another try and the same guy is working. You can't even understand what he saying because he mumbles and after asking him to speak up three times I think he got a little mad because it looked like he just threw the frosting all over my food without any real care about the quality or appearance of what he was giving me. When I got my food wasn't even what I ordered... I ordered mini rolls and I got big ones instead. When I payed I couldn't hear the total but I thought he said 8 something so I didn't think there was anything wrong with my order. I didn't even have the patience to complain because I didn't want to deal with him messing up again or not taking care of my order diligently. I checked my receipt and I paid $25 for something I didn't even want. I don't even want to come back here."}
{"text":"Good the only thing is the staff should listen to the order, cuz once you step out of the outlet it annoying to come back again, and it's pricey as well."}
{"text":"I would've given this place more stars, but I honestly have enjoyed better cinnamon rolls. I paid $7 for a cinnamon roll with two toppings. I definitely love the concept and Vegas needs unique places like these. The staff was really friendly, the lady there let me sample a few of the frosting flavors so I had a better idea of what I wanted. Ended up settling with cake batter frosting with cookie dough and Oreo toppings. Their cookie dough topping was homemade which my boyfriend enjoyed. Overall it was average, the cinnamon roll was very dry, but the customer service deserves three stars more than the actual product."}
{"text":"I love this place. I just think they need to work on consistency in regards to their toppings so I know what I am expecting every time. I normally order the same (cream cheese cookie dough haha) and it is different portions most times lol stop playing with my feelings! Regardless, very friendly staff and super fresh rolls"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our time Trying out this spot. The rolls where warm and so yummy but where VERY sweet. I know it is a Vegan but I needed a glass of milk."}
{"text":"I had no idea that they were on Shark Tank prior to coming here. After seeing that written on signage, it made me want to try it even more. It smelled so good walking up. Once inside, we noticed that it was very cute and quaint. We were immediately greeted and I told the guy that it was our first time there. He informed us that they make gourmet cinnamon rolls and that you can have any type of frosting or topping that you like. For those who like a basic cinnamon roll, they have those, too. I ended up ordering the Old Skool Cinnamon Roll (the basic choice), but I had them drizzle half vanilla icing and half almond icing and add a light sprinkling of pecans and a light drizzle of chocolate. My friend also ordered an Old Skool, but with cream cheese frosting. Those damn things are amazing! It was warm, the frostings really brought it together, especially that almond frosting! I have to definitely get that, again!  Their frosting flavors range from amaretto, lemon, maple, and cake batter to banana cream, caramel, chai, and marshmallow. Toppings include everything from graham crackers, coconut, cookie dough, and pie crumble to pretzels, rainbow sprinkles, brownie bites, and strawberry or raspberry jam!  They also do party packs, but you have to make sure to order ahead. How cool is that to serve gourmet cinnamon rolls at a party, instead of the traditional cake?!"}
{"text":"Don't go here if you don't have an hour or so to wait and I'm not talking about a wait in line.  They move fast to ring you up but they do not move fast to get you your food.    We came here after having dinner at a restaurant... it took longer to get our cinnamon roll to-go than to have a sit down dinner and hangout where we were before.    I don't know if they have to bake each roll from scratch after you order it but I think that's what they did for us.  They should ask you if you want to wait or have a day old one or something because I would have opted for the latter.  Cinnamon roll itself was good (ordered an \"Elvis\" that was cold by the time I got it) but if I am ever \"needing\" another one - I'd look into the delivery service.  Yelp says 45 minutes to be delivered... we waited longer than that at the establishment."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to buy cinnamon rolls . Ever since I found out about them I stop by every chance I get the service is fantastic . They are very trendy with you being able to create your own roll flavor add your own style to something you can eat."}
{"text":"So excited to have a place like this! You can customize your own rolls! I ordered 2 different rolls, took me a while to complete the order since their topping selection is pretty long, exciting and confusing. The staff who helped me was super super nice and very friendly and enthusiastic. I really enjoyed it and will definitely come back. My tab was around $12 for 2 rolls. Definitely against any doctors orders .  Note: this is 2 notches sweeter than regular mall rolls"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I was waiting for it to come to town and it was well worth the wait. You can pick frosting a and toppings so your options are endless!"}
{"text":"Amazing Buns!!  Great customer service and absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"My name is Jay Ess and I'm a Cinnaholic.  I've been to the original Berkeley location a handful of times and am so pumped up about their new franchises popping up around the country!  They have the most delicious cinnamon rolls that happen to be vegan.  I've only had the Old Skool roll since that is all I need!  DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a Cinnaholic in the neighborhood!  These are delicious cinnamon rolls that happen to be VEGAN!  Every non-vegan that I've shared these with love the rolls and said they wouldn't have even known these were dairy and egg free.  I love the classic Old Skool roll!  Yum yum!"}
{"text":"I went to this place not expecting much out of it. I thought it was a racket - a wannabe cinnamon bun place, but I was wrong. So so wrong. This is it. This is the spot. The cinnamon buns are customizable, and VEGAN. That's not something that I would normally rave about but I think it's pretty amazing. I had the cinnamon bun with hazelnut vanilla cream frosting and strawberries and walnuts on top. It was absolutely to die for. The pricing wasn't bad at all either. I also brought home to go a regular cinnamon bun with original frosting and apple pie crumble on top... Is your mouth watering yet? This place is a go!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place over the weekend and I do not see myself going anywhere else to get my sweet tooth fixes.  I was craving a cinnamon roll Sunday afternoon and I originally wanted something from Cinnabon. But the closest one to us closed at 6 pm (it was 5:50 pm by the time the craving hit). So my husband started to look online and he found this place. I ordered an Old Skool roll and he got an Old Skool roll with strawberries. Needles to say, I ended up eating both of them LOL (mind you, I'm 35 weeks pregnant) I had a doctor's appointment today and on my way back, I had to stop by again.  Simply delicious, and worth the drive. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and food!  When I visited I was comped my cinnamon buns and coffee.  The manager was really nice and the staff was friendly.  The food was amazing the best cinnamon bun I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best cinnamon rolls. You have to try, they are little pricey but worth an occasional trip and to spend a few extra dollars for an indulgence of sugar and cinnamon once in awhile.   The guy working wasn't very friendly, but the cream cheese frosting made the situation well worth the lack of personality."}
{"text":"Waking up on this gorgeous Sunday got me thinking after my workout, it was time to try Cinnaholic. Funny, our neighbors mentioned this place to my hubby the other day and he actually wanted to try it too. Rare for him since he likes to stick with the same old places. So off we went.  This is an easy ten minute drive from where we live and easy to find. This is another bookmark completed Yay! We walked in and this cute little doorbell chime went off. There are tables to sit at and the decor is simple yet chic. I explained we were newbies and the helpful clerk walked us through the process. You choose your flavor and then add as many toppings as you like. Everything is vegan which is a plus in my book. I chose the Old Skool roll with vanilla frosting and pecans. My hubby chose the caramel frosting. I wanted to stick with the basic roll to first test out how the actual roll tasted. I was very pleased. The roll is super fluffy and light with a very pure taste. The frosting was yummy and I loved the pecans on top! My hubby loved his roll too and the caramel frosting was true in its flavor. They also had some sample rolls out paired with the maple frosting for anyone to try. Wow! So good!   I noticed as part of the logo, there was a bird in flight. My curiosity got the best of me and I had to ask if the bird had a special meaning. I was told that this happens to be the favorite bird of the owner. The bird is a swallow. She wanted to make sure to differentiate her label from the other competition.   Hands down, this is my new favorite place to score some tasty buns. I can't wait to try the other frosting flavors and toppings! I may require rehab if I become a Cinnaholic....."}
{"text":"I'm not a big dessert fan but this place has me coming back over and over! The Banana Foster is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I was at the grand opening last Friday on tropical Ave I hardly eat sweets but the way they make their cinnamon it's amazing I placed an order for a cake for my wife she told me  she never had eaten any better sweets in her life. I am going back at least  once a week. And I will tell my friends to try it. The place is so clean and the service is so friendly I felt like I am home. Keep up the good work and good luck."}
{"text":"After grabbing dinner at Trail House, our friend mentioned that he wanted to try this place - touting the Shark Tank backed themed Vegan cinnabon.  I ordered a bun with Hazelnut icing and walnuts, my wife got a cookie dough.  The buns were made fresh - so they were hot and when we opened the containers up I saw steam, a large bun - while not tall it covered a lot of area - and enough icing for a small wedding cake.  I dove in and took a bite.    First thing is first: Holy Type II diabetes Batman!  Talk about too sweet.  Second - trying just the bun - I liked that it was hot, but while it looked moist, it had a gritty and tasted dry on my pallet.  Not nearly as good as the rave - I have had local bakery, cinnabon, and the standard Pillsbury Dough Boy canned buns that tasted better and didn't cost $6+.    The cookie dough was boring - it tasted like artificially flavored cookie dough, had that same gritty after taste on the pallet, and was just not satisfying.  We through away 80% of what we bought - which hurt since it was a $13 trip when we would have been a lot happier with even a McDonald's ice cream cone.    Maybe it's that they don't use butter, eggs, milk, but whatever it is, Cinnaholic didn't do anything to help me want to eat vegan.  Shark Tank or not - wasting $13 at Cinnaholic gave me nothing but buyers remorse.  So many better choices out there for desert."}
{"text":"My daughter introduced me to this place. Shame on her. They are soooo delicious. I spend over $35 every visit because I can't take just one home. We Cinnaholic!"}
{"text":"Came in on opening day.  Service at register slightly slow, but it's the first day.  Rolls came out almost as soon as we sat down.  My daughter got the Old Skool and loved it.  I got butterscotch frosting with almonds as a topping.  Wow!!  The price can't be beat!  Much better than the local large franchise we've all had.  Worth the trip to the west side from Henderson!  I will be coming back again!!"}
{"text":"My second time here at this location and I'm still in awe of how amazing their rolls are! My mom says she can't even tell that they're vegan :)  I went in a little less than an hour before closing and the guy at the register was super friendly and even let me sample one of the frostings that I had questions about. It's usually about a 13 minute wait time for the rolls to but it's well worth the wait  Update: went in again and still am super impressed with how awesome the customer service is. I wish I could rate higher than five stars lol"}
{"text":"*Service - As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the first gentleman. He told me he would be with me in just a moment. Within a minute or so another gentleman asked if I had ever been here before. It was my first time so he began to explain the menu to me. The customer service was fast and friendly  *Quality - I ordered a custom cinnamon roll with five different ingredients as the toppings. My order was made exactly the way I ordered it. This cinnamon roll was amazing. I enjoyed every bite of it!   *Value - My total was almost $12 bucks. I had lots of toppings but it still seemed a bit high. Although it ended up being my dinner. So it was a very helpful size.   *Cleanliness - The place was clean and well ventilated. Behind the counter everything was organized and looked fresh.   *Vibes - There were about four other small groups there. It seemed very busy for the workers but they were able to get the food out quick and everybody seemed happy!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and it's been amazing both times! Hands down best customizable cinnamon rolls in the city"}
{"text":"Probably the most amazing cinnamon roll I have ever had!  We ordered the lemon frosting with raspberries and pie crust."}
{"text":"Was craving something sweet, so we tried this place last night. Oh man, it's so delicious! Cinnaholic has multiple choices of frostings and toppings, but being my first time, I wanted to try a classic cinnamon roll. I picked their Old Skool Roll, which comes with a traditional vanilla frosting. When I took my first bite, I was instantly in heaven. The roll itself was baked perfectly and the frosting had just the right amount of sweetness. The Old Skool Roll is the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. Next time, I'll play around with the different flavor combinations, but I can already say I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Its a little pricey, but its a specialty place. They make a living which includes considerable business expense off of cinnamon rolls. Expect to pay a premium. That being said, my wife and I received premium products. Yes, they were cinnamon rolls, but they were at the top of the decadence column! They were all things cinnamon bun, hot, sticky, sweet, gooey, crunchy, soft... All of the textures and flavors were there!  We'll be back and we'd recommend that you stop in and give them a try as well."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING IS VEGAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Service is always great when I come. Vegan cookie dough isn't very common so i would def recommend this as a topping. Also the cinnamon rolls are pretty sweet so I always add a fruit to lighten it. I ate here before I became vegan and I loved it just the same. I have also taken friends here so I wouldn't let the vegan aspect of it shy you away, you won't even notice."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I found this on Yelp and made my friend come with me for a custom-made cinnamon roll. You could have your roll in so many ways that you could imagine! They even have predetermined ones if you can't imagine one yourself. My friend got one topped with their homemade cookie dough. Mine had vanilla frosting, salted pretzels, chocolate chips, and caramel drizzle. I didn't eat mine the same day. I even refrigerated it and had it for breakfast the next morning. After a quick 20 seconds in the microwave my roll was ready to eat. The role was so soft! Even after a day in the fridge!! If you're craving something sweet, I definitely recommend coming here! I will be back to try other combinations. Perhaps a caramel apple topped cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"Marvin simply the best!!! Basically first time being here and we got lots of question and Marvin was patient enough and being very helpful and on top of it he also to it upon him self to pay .95 cents out of his tip Jar since their CC system doesn't charge under $1 dollar so with that said we left and I search my coin jars in the car and put it back on his tip Jar wish the CC take tips and let me charge under a dollar amount!!!"}
{"text":"Fairly simple concept: buy a cinnamon roll, pick your toppings. We went here because it's 100% plant based. It was worth the trip. I had bananas, walnuts and maple icing. My husband did a few different ones. We're looking forward to getting back to Vegas to have more."}
{"text":"It is vegan and it is delicious, you wouldn't be able to tell is not a delicious regular cinabon,  my husband is not vegan and he loves it and don't believe is not a regular stuff lol."}
{"text":"Super yummy!    Went here for a treat with my Cinnabon-loving-father who has recently transitioned to a plant based diet.  The lady working behind the counter was super helpful and quick.  We were the only people when we came in but within the 30 minutes or so we were there at least another 8 customers had come in.  For me there was just a lot of icing, might ask for a little lighter next time but I don't have a huge sweet tooth.  I got a mocha one, my dad made his own, and my daughter got the Cookie Monster.  Definitely recommend when you have the desire for a cinnamon roll.  Think they would benefit highly from having coffee or barista area as well!"}
{"text":"Definitely not to miss for a vegan but still a nice splurge if you just have a sweet tooth. Not cheap but worth the quality. Lots of topping options and made to order. Warm and gooey!"}
{"text":"At first I was apprehensive coming here.  I like my cinnamon rolls plain and simple.  This place is definitely worth checking out on your next cheat night.  I ordered the blueberry pie cinnamon roll and  drooled every bite I took.  I have also ordered the plain original cinnamon roll and it changes lives!  I hate that this place is so close to me.  They also have a really neat rewards program, but let's be honest, we shouldn't come here that much to get those!"}
{"text":"The place smelled amazing when you walked in. I never knew there were so many different frostings available. The people were nice and the place seemed well represented. I didn't dare eat anything this late."}
{"text":"Called super last minute for a slightly big order and they were able to get them done in the time needed.  They smell delicious! Thanks cinnaholics def impressed !"}
{"text":"My favorite dessert! So much better than Cinnabon. Not over cinnamoned on the inside, not undercooked in the inside. Fresh delicious bun, perfect balance of icing. Nothing better in my book. Old school all the way!"}
{"text":"It's fresh! They have a lot of options so it took me a bit to decide what I want. You can ask for a sample of all their fun frosting. I got seasonal strawberry frosting with strawberry topping and it was good!! But if you like the taste of cinnamon, this place is not very strong on that department but since I don't really like strong taste of cinnamon taste, so this one is good for me."}
{"text":"These are soooo good you can not tell they are vegan which says a lot!!! So flavorful and I love that they have so many flavors to choose from and not just your usual cream cheese.. the middle is gooey but I think next time I'll ask for it a min or two undercooked  yum!!! I can't wait for the centennial location to open!! If on this side of town this shop is a definite stop for me!!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe what i just ate was VEGAN! This place is amazing! I had the lemon cinnamon roll and raspberries on top and it was to die for!"}
{"text":"These cinnamon rolls are the best in town. If you have a sweet tooth this is definitely the place to go. The customer service I received when I was there made me feel like I was at home. A very comfortable feeling.  AND ITS VEGAN!!! If no one said anything, you'd have no idea. Everyone needs to try this place."}
{"text":"Not big on leaving reviews but this place is amazing! Better than Cinnabon, by far. I ordered mine Togo because I thought I wouldn't finish it and I killed the entire thing in minutes. I just ordered the \"old school\" cinnamon bun with vanilla frosting but they have other options! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Omg! Went to he grand opening on the 7th( Thursday) in centennial and by Friday I was craving another but Sunday I made my Sunday (today) I made him take me for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We have had several \"specials\" and many original style cinnamon rolls. Our family favorites are original with nuts!  The service speed is rather quick given the fact they are cooking your roll to order. However, the dining area seems to be used more for a waiting area than a eating area. I think it just isn't that inviting for dinning in and could be better laid out with music and some entertainment.  Overall, the rolls are tasty and consistent in quality."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS This place was recommended by a friend who saw their company on Shark Tank. Let me just say, I do NOT regret trying this place out.  Ambiance- The first thing you'll notice as you walk in is the amazing smell of cinnamon that reminds you of baking at home. It definitely was a huge change of setting, and brought me into the world of Cinnaholic  Food- I was feeling adventurous that day, and I decided to try the Vanilla Frosting with chocolate chips and edible cookie dough. WOW. I was not expecting it to be the size it was. Great portions, AMAZING Edible Cookie Dough, and a fabulous treat. I will say that I gave it 4 stars because the dessert was very rich, and I think I'll return to this place on special occasions, and with my family. I am a regular, but don't always go full out.   Overall, this was one of the most delicious desserts I've had in Vegas, and is one of the only places that makes their own Edible Cookie Dough, which was superb."}
{"text":"If your looking for an incredible treat for your taste buds! I highly recommend this place! Not only are the cinnamon rolls fantastic and you get to customize them to your delight! The place is very clean and the service second to none! Great vibe w great music to boot! 5stars!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"When I say love...I mean I loooove this place. Staff always friendly, cinnamon rolls fresh and Vegan. I eliminated dairy from my diet so vegan desserts is what I usually go for. I am hooked. And when you reach your 10th roll you get a free one. Plus they send me coupons for stuff all the time. I have brought some for my coworkers and I tell them after that it's vegan, they say nooo way.  Oh and I love there coffee n almond calia farms coffee creamer."}
{"text":"First time here. Not sure why they call themselves Cinnaholic ... 1/2 the bun had no cinnamon whatsoever ... and the middle was only about 1/2 of Cinnabon. Cute store, great idea ... needs ALOT more cinnamon to even be considered a cinnamon roll, imho.  Won't come back ... too bad."}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until my husband and I drove by. We love cinnabuns and decided to give it s try. This place was super yummy! You can come with any creation you want. They have a board of frostings and toppings to choose from. They also have a menu from creations they've come up with. They're priced well, and I think this concept is awesome. The place itself is very clean and the staff is nice as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy that they have vegan options and dairy free milk. The cinnamon rolls are very decadent but, a little on the sweet side. Portion sizes are very large as well and one can share a roll with a friend they're so large."}
{"text":"I was in need of s sugar fix and this place had just opened up by my house! It's such a great idea, so I went in to try it. I decided to order a roll with peanut butter frosting and the cookie dough. The nice lady at the register told me it was going to be about 15 minutes because they make the rolls fresh, and I could deal with that for a fresh roll! The cinnamon roll really good, soft, and fresh. I loved the peanut butter frosting but I think next time I'll skip on the topping. The cookie dough was good but a bit overwhelming. All in all cinnaholic has a great concept and if you're wanting to try a different dessert I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"This was an amazing taste experience for cinnamon rolls baked fresh with wide assortment of frosting flavor S and available toppings.  There is also a display case with the current fan favorites.  I tried the Almond frosting with fresh peaches and will return with the family.  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"It's so good third time here it's hot and fresh to order tons of options for toppings tonight I'm having the tiramisu frosting.  The front display is enticing with Carmel Apple on top of the cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"WOW!!! All i can say is Wow!!! The best thing to ever exist! I stopped in here to fix a sweet tooth, left hooked! I thought there's no way this exists, now I can't get enough it's so Amazingly Great! The flavor options, the specials, the freshness. You couldn't ask for a better product, and here's the best part. Everything is all Vegan!"}
{"text":"So this new location is phenomenal!!! It feels so big, and has an amazing selection to choose from! I never thought that cinnamon rolls would have me so hooked! I am a Cinnaholic and I've never been prouder to admit it! From the amazing bananas foster to the chocolate bomb, I know I can always find something I want here! The environment is so uplifting too, the staff is so welcoming and helpful! They let me sample some frostings to make sure I truly got what I wanted. I'll be back again and again and again.... the smells alone have me floating in like a Disney character"}
{"text":"Straight forward. You can ask for recommendations. The price is roughly $6 for 3 toppings. It is really sugary there's no way around it. My only complaint is that I received my rolls barely warm. I looked past it for the most part because the taste is very good. However I am still longing for a warm roll."}
{"text":"Holy Cinnamon gods of cinnamon roll heaven. This place is amazing. My husband surprised me with one of these unearthly magestic cinnamon rolls and now I CAN'T STAY AWAY. The Chai frosting is omg good. Go try this place or not whatever more for me."}
{"text":"So I came here for a mid day snack with my hubby for the first time just today! Excited because we live far away and finally found a chance to check this place out on our day off...   But, as a first impression, we didn't get greeted at all walking in, and the lady who took our order was rude!   We didn't really know what to order or how to navigate the menu, so I told her it was our first time. She then told us to just take the steps listed and then order from there. She didn't guide us on it or give any suggestions.  Not a smile or a lick of care was given.   We still ordered something regardless of whatever happened to her attitude. I was too excited for dessert!!!  It all tasted great!  & I LOVE that's it's VEGAN!   If I had to bash them on something food related it'd be that the icing is many a bit much? Too sweet if you ate it with all that comes on top. Especially once it melts down, you realize how much just goes to waste.   But I also noticed that in this place it doesn't say ANYWHERE that it is Vegan? Maybe it might scare away non-Vegans.   But regardless, I'd go back again  (for the cinnamons buns, not the service). Just probably not on Sundays after 2"}
{"text":"Cinnaholic has been on my radar for a while... if you follow them on instagram, you'll know why.  It is a little bit \"removed\" from Charlotte... but for a short drive, the payoff is well worth it if you have a friend that's vegan or you yourself are one, the vegan options in Charlotte are few and far between.  This location is in Wesley Chapel, which has been experiencing a lot of growth lately.  The shopping center is fairly new... I think I only knew it as a movie theater location, but it's good to see more buildings and businesses are filling in around it.  Walked in during the afternoon and the nice lady at the register greeted us and gave us the spiel on how everything worked with the menu.  A few minutes later, we were gorging ourselves with cinnamon rolls.  Probably could have shared one, but I figured since we came all the way out there... may as well try 2 different rolls.  Tried the original - YUM and their cookie monster.... which ended up being super decadent and heavy... but if you are a fan of cookie dough, this will not disappoint.    The shop is a typical size strip mall shop... a handful of tables around.  There were some teenagers hanging out in the corner.... I guess this is the 2018 version of Dairy Queen when I was growing up.  Water is available, but they also carry other choices for drinks in a cooler.  Their display case had Avengers: Infinity War inspired concoctions... which I thought was novel.  Overall a great experience... I would come back to try their thousands of combinations when you customize a roll or two."}
{"text":"Yum! Something for everyone! They use lots of frosting too which is a huge bonus!!! Fresh out of the oven so a little melty in the pictures."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to these delicious little bastards, but the last two visits they forgot one of my rolls. I guess I should blame myself a little as I should have checked my bag of sinful delight before I left.   Too much icing on my roll as well, a little ridiculous when you have to shovel all the icing off to find the roll.   Employees are nice, but seem to lack a little leadership from management.   This doesn't mean I won't be back, I'll just ensure to check my bag before I leave in the future."}
{"text":"I've never been the biggest fan of cinnamon rolls. They've always just seemed to be a bit overrated and as much as I like sugar/frosting it always just seemed a bit much. All that changed when I discovered Cinnaholic after a coworker brought some in and opened up my eyes.  I'll be honest with you, it's sweet. Very sweet if I'm being honest , but it's well glazed and not overly cinnamon-y. I also appreciate the fact that they have all sorts of flavors and you can customize them so it almost feels like you're at a customer bakery and not just for cinnamon rolls. I will say I also didn't believe they were vegan, which is mind blowing. I'm not personally Vegan, but I have enough Vegan friends that it's great to have another option.  The only downside is that it is across from LVAC, so it is flavored with the additional guilt of a wasted gym membership, which is probably why it's so well loved."}
{"text":"I have been here tons of times and it seems to get worse every time I go . I go every once in awhile waiting for it to get back to what I remember ."}
{"text":"I can't swear on here but oh my goodness yes Cinnaholic is the bees knees!!  I didn't even know that this vegan sweet spot existed until I was browsing on uber eats.  I ordered the Jelly Donut cinnamon roll.  It has raspberry jam paired with vanilla frosting and a generous topping of pie crumble over the sweet soft bun....LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Even though it is 100% vegan the flavors were just spot on.  They didn't taste overly sweet or have a weird aftertaste like some vegan sweets I've had in the past.  Can't wait to try the other flavors and share with friends."}
{"text":"Greeted soon as we entered, very friendly staff, explain to us how the ordering works, suggested to try out some frostings, we ordered butterscotch with caramel sauce and cream cheese with half strawberry toppings and cookie dough... it was delicious! First timers get discount from yelp at check-in! We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"First off.   The cinnamon roll is  good but the pricing structure is misleading and off base.  I didn't want the globbed on super thick frosting and asked for light frosting.  (Less frosting apparently costs 50 cents more)   I asked for a roll with pecans... apparently pecans are an upgrade but because I asked for pecans I was given a crumble crust that is also an additional upgrade.  What I thought was a 4.50 roll ended up costing 6.50.   To top it off it really was not that big.      To recap, for taste it is good (But not OMG good and comparable to most others you can buy) but for value, this was a one time curiosity purchase.   The kids working there were super nice so too brings it up to 7.50 for a medium size so-so roll.   It was also clean and bright and the smell of the place is kind of heaven....   hopefully they will figure out their pricing structure."}
{"text":"I didn't care for the flavors from Cinnaholic. I ordered the lemon frosting roll with walnuts and raspberries. The icing had an unappealing flavor that I couldn't quite place. I also tried a bite of my friend's roll with a different flavor icing and I didn't care for it either.   The texture of the roll itself was fine and I would be interested in trying other flavors to see if I found them more appetizing, minus the icing."}
{"text":"Tried Cinnaholic for the 1st time last night. I had been trying to make it there for awhile so was pretty psyched to finally try it. We had a party of 4 people in front of us which we figured was no big deal. Upon entering you're overpowered by a super sweet scent that I kept thinking had an odd chemical smell to it as well. The cashier (who also had to stop waiting on his current customer to answer the phone) took our order and stated it would be a ten minute wait.  Again not a huge deal since the rolls are baked fresh, but the place wasn't busy so I was a bit surprised yet happy to have a freshly baked product. That was at 6:42 pm and we didn't end up getting our two rolls until 7:15. While waiting I kept noticing the off putting chemical smell as well as the fact that the dining room was not the cleanest. Also noticed the employees wear gloves to handle the food which I thought was a good practice until my husband and I both witnessed them touching pretty much everything from the register to the counters to the actual rolls..ewww!! The cashier even used the gloved hand to fill the fork container and when they started to fall out grabbed them w/ the ungloved had so no idea what the point of the gloves is.  Finally got our order (1) lemon blueberry and (1) turtle to see that both boxes looked a mess on the outside as if a child had played in chocolate and proceeded to stick their hands all over the boxes, there was even chocolate inside the box w/ the lemon blueberry roll.   Ok on to the taste, the chemical odor I was smelling the entire time we were there was the OVERLY sweet vanilla frosting. I expected sweet, but these things were too much along with the frosting being gritty w/ the chemical taste. On a positive note, I had never had anything vegan before and you'd never know these are and they were served hot, but were so sweet and chemically that we didn't even finish them and the poor things ended up in the trash. It was a very unfortunate waste of time and money. I'm sticking w/ Cinnabon."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if maybe we came to close to closing time but I'm not sure our order was fresh. We had an \"old skool\" & a few mini buns just to try it out. The icing was good. I like my cinnamon rolls with lots of icing & they sure weren't greedy or stingy with that so that was good. Next time, I'll try a more adventurous flavor and topping."}
{"text":"Delicious find!!! I'm not vegan but have an egg allergy. It had been at least 10 years that I had had a cinnamon roll, And was excited to try this place on the recommendation of a good friend in Las Vegas. Good thing the closest one to me is about 1.5 hrs away!  I would eat a cinnamon roll for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and all snacks. Lol. I ordered the cookies and cream, and ate the whole thing in one sitting. Delicious! My husband ordered the coconut cream pie. To take home, I created my own- caramel frosting, with blueberries, almonds,  pretzel sticks, and coconut. Sounds weird but it was delicious! I ate it 3 days later, and, warmed up, it tasted as fresh as the one I had in the store.  The two young guys who are working in the store were extremely friendly and patient in helping the four of us decide what to order.  I'm not a Las Vegas person, but aside from visiting my two closest friends there, this is one of the food places that I will have to visit the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 old school cinnamon rolls with vanilla frosting ..got them home and took 2 bites and threw away in garage because they saturated in the horrible tasting vanilla frosting..i couldnt tell you how the actual cinnamon roll tasted because the frosting was so over powering..ill stick to Cinnabon..way better...more thing I'm so sick of seeing a tip cup on the counter ..especially for counter service...so what do u want a tip for?? Ur not waiting tables..soon as i saw that..I was disappointed..."}
{"text":"Peanut butter frosting. Vegan magic. Go.   The almond frosting is super good also.  We got the peanut butter frosting rolls tonight for family dinner. No one believes they're vegan.  We haven't tried the other flavors because they are so good we don't want to risk it."}
