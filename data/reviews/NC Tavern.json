{"text":"3 stars only because the food was good. 
The waitresses look a little hood, like some extras from the movie \"atl.\" 
At least invest in some tshirts for the establishment."}
{"text":"Chicken awesome...service less than stellar but worth tolerating for those wings! But if you get there early Danielle and Nikki are awesome and attentive. Before 7pm is OK for kids. Also the fried plate special is a great value for 2 to split"}
{"text":"i frequented this establishment at least 30 times i will never come back it took me 25 minutes to be seen and then i was asked to pay before i even had food!!!!

they said they have walk outs!!!!

that aint my fault!!!

i'm a avid foodie, well known in the foodie community and i will never come back here!!!

#facts

i can spend my money elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is average and reasonably priced. A neighborhood place that you could learn to frequent because convenience of location and quick food."}
{"text":"They steal money off your card and when you call they act like the don't speak english. I used to frequent this place but when they messed my orders they would blame me (wrong flavor on wings). Then would proceed to not like me order anything else.  They will rip you off. I refuse to get treated like that. My coworkers and I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Great food,  horrible customer service.  Staff is friendly just SLOW and we were unattended most of the time.  It's not a kid friendly environment.  Music is going constantly so you can talk loud cause you have no other choice.  This is a bar with good food,  cheap prices and subpar customer service"}
{"text":"Good wings and drink specials but the customer service is lacking. Not sure if it's because of their youth or poor training. The waitress had the nerve to serve us chocolate cake on a real plate with a plastic fork. Where dey do dat at????"}
{"text":"I saw plenty of others having 1 star experiences, but I have no serious complaints.  Decent food for super cheap.  I just wouldn't want others to go out of their way to go here on my recommendation.  This very well could be a rowdy bar on a Friday or Saturday night as the crowd looked pretty hood.

You know that this isn't your average place the second you walk in the door.  I didn't mind the bass heavy music, but your average family might.  The funniest part of just getting started with trying to eat here is that there is a hostess table, but its a seat yourself restaurant.  There isn't a sign saying to do either, so you just stand there.  I saw at least 3 sets of people stand there and then walk out, it was almost comical to see how long people would wait before leaving.

Luckily, I was just lazy and sat myself without finding out protocol, and found myself a server relatively quickly.  Although our server was friendly, we did have to ask for our refills.  We got some wings that were pretty good.  I had a blackened chicken wrap that wasn't anything special.  Pretty much the same was said by my buddy who got the burger.

The check to a little while, but there were people that had been sitting for 30 minutes and hadn't gotten their drinks yet, so I can't hate on my experience."}
{"text":"Food is awesome . Employees are amazing. But sometimes the seafood isn't always cooked, and the chicken sits out uncovered. Management is disrespectful which makes me think bad of the business. They have had a failed business in the past which speaks volumes."}
{"text":"Wings weren't that great but the shrimp was simu amazing !! I wish I had orders carb legs instead of the wings. Atmosphere was ok. Probably won't go back unless it's for crab legs :)"}
{"text":"I went in to watch a game alone. I sat at the bar and ordered wings, and a henny with coke . A Chinese lady was the bartender.  She was very rude to me and when I asked to speak to management about her behavior she told me she was the manger.  I told the owner and he apologized for her behavior but really didn't try to intervene.  She may have been his wife based off his response or lack of response to her rudeness.  It's sad that we spend our money in an establishment that practically gave me their  ass to kiss. I will not be back and I will let everyone I came in contact with know about the way I was treated. I'm very disappointed because I don t have a mean bone in my body and didn't deserve the treatment I got."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here for the first time. Everything we ate was delicious..raw oysters, steamed shrimp and grilled shrimp wraps were delicious beyond words!!  Would highly recommend and we WILL be back!!"}
{"text":"The $0.60 wing, shrimp and oyster special is great, and the seafood is surprisingly fresh. This place is a dive mixed with a sports bar - but they have the best food, right? The waitresses are friendly and personable. Service is a little slow, but the food is inexpensive and delicious. There are lots of TVs, no wait for seating and a family-friendly atmosphere. Go. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best raw bar my wife and I have been to in a long time! Great hostess, servers, atmosphere and the place beats ALL prices! We'll be back!....Hope they don't change the music either!"}
{"text":"Love the $5 drink specials on Saturday nights but my crown & coke was a little off. For my next drink I asked for straight crown. Our waitress was very personable but when we wanted our check it took about 10min to hunt her down. The nachos con queso were terrible. Cocktail shrimp and mozzarella sticks were okay. Loved the music and the atmosphere. No wait to be seated late on a Sat night which was great."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with my friends on a Friday afternoon, right after they opened. We were greeted by an angry women who seemed like she hated her job. We only saw her when she dropped off drinks, food and checks. No refills, no boxes when asked. I got nachos and the queso was cold. I also got sweet tea that tasted like pure syrup. The food was terrible. The service was worse. I don't suggest this place whatsoever."}
{"text":"Great food prices.  However the wait staff is horrible. I went to meet friends for dinner on Friday night. I stepped out side to patio while waiting on my drink and food. While outside, waitess pushed by me in a rush. At 1st the thought she was just busy. Then when I went back in. The same waitstaff pushed me in my back and told me I was in the way!!! Rude!!! I will not be back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's card information was taken after he paid. A few days later he had transactions on his card from another state. NC Tavern- you're losing a long time loyal customer. Future visitors: PAY IN CASH!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and went anyway. I'm glad that I did. I went this past Saturday for their Soca party. I had a great time. I ate the calamari there and it was good. Nice size and much larger than what I am used to seeing and quite affordable too (under $7).  The staff was outstanding! Everyone was very helpful and kind - no surly attitudes anywhere. My waitress and another one who was working another table were both very attentive and fun. I would definitely return and recommend this place."}
{"text":"The management here is absolutely terrible. We ordered a simple meal (chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks) which took close to two hours to recieve. When we asked to speak to a manager about the awful service, he snatched the plates from in front of us and said \"you no pay, you no eat.\" There was clearly a communication issue, however as a manager that is unacceptable behavior. Take your business elsewhere. The food isn't that great anyway."}
{"text":"Love the food esp the Jerk chicken wrap!! Im addicted.. I would def recommend affordable prices and great food. Great service and the environment wad welcoming this place is my new spot"}
{"text":"I just spoke with management, the accepted a fraudulent credit card to my account without checking signature and ID. Manager was not helpful, said even though I'm in Florida, I should call Charlotte police for him to report frauds (5 separate charges). Luckily my bank covers all this, shame not a helpful place"}
{"text":"If I could give these fools zero stars, I would! My experience was not only shocking but down right offensive! I went here to meet up with my good friend. I sat at the bar waiting for service for 15 min before I asked what the hold up was because others were being served before me. She said  \"I refuse to serve over there anymore!\" I was in shock bc i never been here before and i just sat down! I called the manager to tell him the situation and he igonored me! I believe the staff is racist against african americans!! What other reason would they have to serve a complete stranger who was dressed nicely and respectful!"}
{"text":"Food was really good but the waitress barely showed up to our table."}
{"text":"Updated:
I have to eat some crow...I thought I had a bad charge on my card, but I made a mistake.  Nothing fraudulent was done on on their part.  

I read others reviews about fraudulent activity after using their cards at this place, so I took heed and brought cash.  Just as a precaution.  The wings are pretty damn good and the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Dee was just an amazing waitress, checked on us every second to make sure my company and I where absolutely satisfied salute to you girlie! Thank you & YES NC TAVERN the food was absolutely amazing!! First time coming & it wont be my last!!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is worst place ever!!! The service on Friday night is deplorable! My friend and I waited 35 mins before a waitress came to our table. There was no service on the patio and the place was not even crowed. The food was good but I will not return!! The service needs to be better!! If I could give this place a zero star I would!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. After 15 mins of playing pool behind a glass partition no staff came to inquire if we needed anything. At one point, I waved down a waitress who looked dead in my eyes and never came to take order. I then went to bar and spoke with manager who informed me I would have to let the waitresses know who were sitting around on their cell phones to take my order. I politely asked him if he wanted me to ask for service and then pay too and he gives me a blank stare like yeah. And the other patrons who heard this looked in shock. So after we played our pool we left this horrible establishment that you have to beg to take orders then pay for poor service. Don't waste your time and certainly not your money. The manager had no care or concern but to take your money. Attached is a pic of the wait staff sitting. Who sits and waits for tips? Wow. Worst ever"}
{"text":"Have you recently had a colonoscopy? You will look back upon the experience with fondness after eating here.  No, seriously, have your interior probed before dining at this establishment. It's never a bad idea to get to know the doctor this undercooked food will be forcing you to visit."}
{"text":"There always new staff when I come here. I was a loyal customer I loved the wings & shrimp and especially the cheap drinks. My card was compromised after my last visit here! I will not return here EVER again! FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD! DON'T PAY WITH A CARD"}
{"text":"This place is great. Crablegs for $11.99!!! Great drinks! Inexpensive and good food! Great staff. Parking can be tricky if it's packed."}
{"text":"Worst place ever I went there for lunch and they told seat anywhere you want !!!! I wait for 10 min no one knowledge me I wave to 3 girls serves and they just told wave back and they said wait .....after 20 min I just got up and talk the the owner ...and let home know the situation....and I just walk out I spend half of my lunch ...waiting on some one ...to take my order or just to offer me water or something ...."}
{"text":"This review is purely for the Labor Day All White Reggae Party. The 1st DJ was AWESOME.. great mix of reggae, soca, reggaeton, and dancehall on top of hip-hop beats.. I wish he spun the whole time. I heard that he's the DJ at Tropix, so i'll definitely have to check that spot out. The 2nd DJ was better as an emcee, with that being said people pretty much stopped dancing.. me included. My friend and I left shortly after. The outside patio area was nice for a break from dancing. 

I have no idea what the food or drink quality is. My friend got a drink and said it was watered down, but I have no firsthand experience with that. I rarely drink and did not partake that evening. 

As a reference point- this place is really close to the PNC Pavilion. 

Tip: This place stays open late- until 2 AM most days."}
{"text":"The only reason I give it 2 stars is because they actually have good food and drinks for a good price. The customer is never consistent. Some days have been good and some awful. And the most important part is that mine and 4 of my friends got our credit card information stolen. Everyone in my party that used a credit/debit card got our information stolen! Allegedly the person who stole our information is no longer working there but that's a definite red flag for this establishment."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined at NC tavern about four times in just the month of August, spending a minimum of $50.00 visit.  Today is the first time We've paid with a debit card and was asked  for an ID. We presented an ID but asked the waitress to let the owners know we frequent their establishment  and are good customers and are never asked for ID when dining at other restaurants.  Unfortunately, the only explanation is discrimination. We've noticed 99% of the clientele are African- Americans and evidently they continue to patronize this business although they are blatantly disrespected. Shame on NC TAVERN for collectively treating their customers as 2nd class citizens that can't be trusted.  - Stephanie"}
