{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my overall experience at Sotto Sotto.  
The experience started as such: made 9:45pm reservations, but i was not seated until after 10pm.  I was less than annoyed at that but I did not let it get to me.  The place appears small from the outside, but it is certainly not very small on the inside... and rammed! 
My date and I started out with bruschetta which was fantastic. I ordered the Valpolicella to drink. For the mains, I had the Vitella Della Nonna (Veal with eggplant).  Everything about this main was to die for!  My date ordered Pollo in Carrozza (Chicken topped with prosciutto and mozza).  To me this tasted a bit bland, but the date really liked it.  We opted for dessert - Foresta Nera.  O. M. G.  Can't go wrong with chocolate and raspberry!"}
{"text":"I probably like this restaurant a bit better than Spuntinis - only because their pasta, I find, is better. However, this is probably not the greatest way to pass judgement since I've eaten at Spuntinis multiple times while I've only been to Sotto Sotto once.

I went with a girlfriend of mine. Real simple review:
1. The bread was good
2. The pasta was really good
3. The service was meh - our waitress was a bit snooty for my liking. 
4. The ambiance was good/romantic/dark-lit
5. I felt congested in there. Short ceilings.
6. Lots of noise, so if you're looking for a super romantic quiet dinner don't go here. But it's okay for a fun date night or girl's night.

I wouldn't mind going back. But I wouldn't mind if I never returned."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend because we wanted serious Italian food and a romantic atmosphere. When we got there, it was jam packed even though it was 9:30. Our reservation was for 9:45 and they didn't keep us waiting for long although the waiting area was non-existent so people were packed up against the walls and the stairs. But they posted all the pictures of celebrities that had dined there so that entertained us for about 10 minutes.

The lady who brought us to our table and our waiter wasn't super friendly like they might be at chucky cheese but as humble students, we didn't really care. One might consider it snobby but we didn't really think so.

We ordered a beef appetizer to share that came with rocket and cheese. Then for the main course, my boyfriend had the scallops with a side of linguine and I had the appetizer sized pasta with salmon and asparagus. I'm glad I ordered the appetizer size because the main portion would've been too big. My pasta was delicious even though it wasn't extravagant. Texture of the pasta was good and the sauce wasn't too heavy. My boyfriend loved the scallop. It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Even the plain linguine had a good flavor.

Then, because I'm a sucker for dessert, we ordered the dessert daily special to share which was a nutella tart. It was AMAZING (although it would've been better with ice cream). 

My biggest problem with this restaurant was that it was too noisy. Granted, it was a Saturday night and there's nothing a restaurant can do about noise but if you're looking for a quiet romantic spot, this isn't the best place to go. At least not on a Saturday. 

The price was a tad expensive considering what they were serving wasn't THAT superb but if you want solid, tasty Italian food and want to get dressed up for an evening, this place isn't a bad idea. We probably won't come back here again considering we're living on a university student budget but it was a novelty experience.

I recommend you make a reservation."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding Italian. Have been there a few times, and have never been disappointed. Even the angel hair pasta was al dente... Perfect. And reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"If your in need of fine Italian Cuisine in Toronto Downtown Sotto Sotto is the best Italian Restaurant in the city. Their muscles with tomato sauce is to die for and their Sea food risotto is one of a kind!"}
{"text":"The best authentically Italian restaurant in Toronto - HANDS DOWN!  I am there every year on my birthday, and a couple of other times during the year, and I have to say, the place never looses it's charm or appeal.  People find it pricey, but honestly compared to most places in Toronto that cater to the Italian palette, nothing comes quite close.  Rustic dishes done in the traditional styles make this one of my favourite restaurants ever.  You won't be disappointed from beginning to end.  Now, I am of Italian origin and can honestly say that if you are looking, look no further, you have found that slice of Italy here in Toronto.  Atmosphere, ambiance, service and food - stellar!"}
{"text":"After glowing reviews from yelp and hotel concierge we had a dinner here on 8/31/12.  Before coming we knew the place was small and popular.  What we didn't know was that it was small, popular and CRAMPED.  They stuffed as many tables into a small place as the can.  

I rate eating establishments on three things: service, quality of food and atmosphere. All of this taking into consideration the average price paid for a dish.  The quality of the food was great. We had a polenta with mushrooms to start, and a couple of vegetarian pasta dishes for our entree. With a very moist Tiramisu.  Food is what kept this place at 3 stars.

Service they failed.  We were seated and a lady came 15 minutes after being seated to get us menus and water.  She was just rude and would give smart remarks.  She would ignore our table to go chat with friends or regulars.  It was annoying and we almost walked out.

Atmosphere was very bad.  When we went they rented a portion of the place out to a birthday party.  The entire hour we were there this party was loud and they screamed and sang.  Many of the party stumbled out drunk, one person actually knocked a drink over into a another diners (sitting at a table next to us) dish while they were eating.  It felt like being in a club and not a quiet and 
romantic place to eat.  

With the service and atmosphere this place is not worth it.  Management could have done a lot better.  They are open for lunch, so it might be quieter, but I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I'll get to the point - you will not be disappointed with Sotto Sotto. However, by no means did it wow me. This is one of those instances where the hype skewed my expectations. Perhaps if I had found this gem on my own it would have left more of a mark. The atmosphere, service and food are all top notch but nothing memorable. The place just oozes of arrogance. I've had better italian meals in the city that are cheaper too. If your goal is to impress your date and brag about your social status, you've come to the right place."}
{"text":"Very good. I suggest the gnockies and the bransino.  Very expensive."}
{"text":"The food was pretty amazing but I have to say for the price I would have expected stronger service. Too long for drinks and too long to clear table between courses. It's all in the little things. Clams, veal and mushroom pasta all amazing. Pasta was slightly undercooked but still delicious!"}
{"text":"Yes Sotto Sotto was always recommended as the place for the TIFF. So on my birthday this April, it became a surprise place to celebrate by my fiancée .  We went to the ROM and then went straight to the restaurant. 
No, we did not dress to the 9's because we were at the ROM. But judging from the other patrons, we were okay - leather jackets with chic jeans are the norms. 

He told them it was my birthday too. 

It was a Saturday night at 630 do it was not too busy, 
The place was not packed but they put us at the back of the restaurant, close to the kitchen, adjacent to a table of apparent regular customer (a pretty woman with her daughter). Hey why did I mention this ? Because I can see the big difference in service and the indifference in their server's behaviour when we asked for the menu. 

The hostess never told the server that it was a birthday celebration, even though she remembered . She said that .\"oh yes I remembered it was a birthday reservation\". 

We ordered sparkling water, appetizers (buffalo cheese with tomato, special seafood platter. There were 3 pieces of somewhat green tomato (not the sun ripe or even hot house ripe favour) and a good size mozzarella cheese. But the tomato was of such poor quality and I wondered how they could charge $15 

The seafood \"platter\" appetizer was indeed \"see food\" because it was made up of 2 pieces of shrimp (mid size 21-30 per pound ), 3 pieces of calamari . It was a personal size. But at least the server suggested that you needed to order two plates and that it was not for sharing 

The server also recommended Nona made lasagna and I had veal .
Nona's lasagna was about a 5 oz serving (the entire lasagna serving was cut from a bigger platter. It measured 4 inch by 2 inch ) . It sat in a small baking dish. It was tasty , cheesy but it was not enough for a normal serving, 
But I guess this is what Nona was willing to share, 

We also had to wave down the server to ask for Parmesan cheese because he was too busy with the pretty girls in the corner. 

I had veal with egg plant. It was good ..they are a bit cheap on the egg plant, there was two pieces of egg plant . Because my partner was hungry, I gave him one of my veal. 

During the entire seating, there was two interactions with the server. We decided not to order wine because of the cold reception.  

Even though they were informed  that it was my birthday,  nothing was offered , not even an acknowledgement ...so great service? Really ? 
May be for rich movie stars or people who look the \"part\" 

Service - mediocre to indifferent 
Food - over price and so so (for a foodie) 
Atmosphere - basement look, dark corners, no music to help with ambiance 
Value - Poor 

Yes their sister restaurant Sputini is much better. We celebrated many parties there and their manager is always good ..regardless how we dress. 
So close down their basement joint !"}
{"text":"This is one of the most high end restaurants in Toronto. It's also a favourite among celebrities. You always hear some story of some star eating there during Film Festival. It's super small and cozy and kind of off the beaten track because it's up Avenue Rd. instead of right in the heart of Yorkville. They have valet parking and it's some of the best Italian food you'll ever have. Be prepared to spend a lot of money and it's near impossible to get a reservation during Film Fest. Two stars that are ALWAYS there are Sharon Stone and Coin Ferrell. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place ever this is a place where you take your special date to with very reasonable price and amazing ambiance so romantic and amazing food I ordered two salads and  two dover sole grilled and deboned amazing this is a place to take your girlfriend or wife to she and you would love it, it only costed me 147 worth every penny."}
{"text":"One of our top places for Italian food in Toronto. We specifically frequent Sotto for the variety of sea food. The freshness of the fish and cocking is by far one of the best. The waiters are attentive and the atmosphere is great. This is a smaller place and we have been disappointed in the past when we try to be impulsive and show up without a reservation. So make sure you reserve and hope you enjoy the place as much as we do."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous! It is very romantic.. you truly feel as though you're having dinner in a quaint & cozy restaurant somewhere in Italy. It's perfect for dinners with your hubby. This restaurant has superb staff, whom are charming, and very knowledgeable of the menu. The food, from beginning to end was an absolute dream. I mean, anything from the appetizer to the main course and desert, the chefs at this restaurant are unbelievable. What is also great about the restaurant is their valet service, especially during winters in Toronto, it makes all the difference knowing that you don't have to ruin your hair and shoes running from where you parked your car to inside the restaurant.. just let the valet do what they're there to do:) Overall, leaving Sotto Sotto, although it has a fairly smaller square footage than most restaurants, I left there with a fantastic overall experience, to which I have since recommended to many friends and family. It was a darling little place, with outstanding quality about everything to it. Book a reservation soon, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Will eat here again next time I'm in Toronto. My faves: grilled octopus, osso bucco and the pistachio panna cotta.  All superb!"}
{"text":"Small but cozy place and apparently a favorite of many celebrities during the film festival.  No review could really do justice for how FREAKIN AWESOME the food was....  I recommend the pesce del mondo.  Call ahead & make reservations though, this place is packed by 7:00."}
{"text":"I love sotto sotto... Their seafood risotto that comes in a pot is incredible. Their bruschetta its beyond words. I love how you feel like your going into an underground cave in italy their. When I was younger it was a hotspot during filmfest time. Now that has died down a bit.
Its very rustic with dim lighting.. The only downfall is they dont have a waiting area and should learn to say no to clients they cant give tables to immediately. It gets stuffy and congested because its so small."}
{"text":"I would rate Sotto Sotto 3.5 stars

We had a 9:45 pm reservation and showed up there a little earlier thinking we would grab a drink before we get seated. Big mistake - they do not have a bar area and no waiting area either. The front entrance is quite entertaining with pics of all celebrities (many pics have been repeated several times) but very congested for waiting. I would recommend getting there right before you reservation.  We were seated around 10 minutes after our reservation time which was a little annoying as we had been waiting in their hallway for some time very uncomfortably already.

I had the seafood spaghetti described as friends of the sea on the menu after reading few yelp reviews recommending it. The tomato based sauce was light which was nice and the friends of the seafood were generous servings and priced at around $20 - $25 it was well worth it.

My husband has an allergy to shellfish and asked them to remove shrimp, any crab or lobster in the dish and they were quite willing to do so - it still had clams, mussels, scallops. However when the dish came the staff all announced his was the \"allergy\" dish but it still had crab so they had to take it back and make it again. So he started his meal much later than the rest of us did and overall our meals took quite some time to be served. 

The place is very cozy and intimate which is very nice. It definitely has a home-like feel to it but it gets quite loud in there - really hard to hear each other. We were seated in the farther room at the back right by the windows and it got quite chilly in there.

I would return actually (a) to try many other things on their menu as i wasn't blown away by what i had and they have such an extensive menu and (b) i MUST love it since ALL those celebrities ate here! ;)"}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend Sotto Sotto. The service was amazing, aside from the waiter forgetting my Tiramisu and latte at the end of the meal, but whatever; between appetizers and main he cleaned the crumbs off the table! I've never seen that before. 

I'm constantly on the search for the best \"Caprese Insalata\", and I think I've found it. Sotto Sotto's Bufalo Caprese was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic! The mozzerella was so fresh and soft that when you cut into it, it sort of oozed out all over the tomato... (pardon me while I drool in rememberance). 

I had Butaccini Al Pomodoro for my main, and the tomato sauce was simple and classic but incredibly flavourful. It might have been the perfect sauce. I also sampled the Gnocci with Quatro Formagio sauce, and that was really good too, considering I'm not a big Alfredo fan. 

For dessert I had the best Tiramisu of life, and was lucky enough to have a taste of the Dolce de Leche Cheesecake. I'm glad I didn't order it because it was sinfully good and would have taken me hours to finish, because I would have savoured every single particle of it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food!  Wonderful service!  I went by myself while on a business trip and the staff greeted me and talked with me about the restaurant.  The tomato sauce is to die for.  Highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"I've usually just taken dates to Sotto Sotto, and I've never had anything but fantastic meals and service.

This past weekend, I took my 8 year old daughter and I will say that I had as great an experience with her than I have had with anybody else...needless to say, our relationship will last far longer than that with anybody else!  ;-)

This restaurant is not \"kid friendly\" in the sense that there is no children's menu, and the restaurant is expensive...but If you're up for spending the money, you will not be disappointed.

Luckily, (or unfortunately because I was paying) my daughter has my appetite, so we were able to order individual appetizers and entrees.

Abigail started off with a gingerale, and I opted for a dry gin martini.  From there, she decided on Mussels (with white wine as she doesn't like tomato chunks in her sauces) and I went with the beef carpaccio.  She was really digging the mussels, but of the two she let me have, they were succulent, large and delicious.  My carpaccio was fantastic, and she really enjoyed the sample I gave her...until I told her what it was and then she just kind of glared at me.  Luckily that blew over quickly and our entrees arrived.

I ordered a half litre of Cesari Valpolicella Ripasso ($28.50) to go with the rest of my meal.  I guess at this point I should mention that we were staying at the Intercontinental Yorkville and within walking distance just to ensure the teetotalers of Yelp.

Keeping in mind her aversion to tomato chunks, I ordered her (my absolute favourite on the menu) the Rigatoni Al Quattro Fromaggio, and I had one of the featured dishes, Pappardelle w/Meatballs (or if you're familiar with the restaurant, Mamma's meatballs).  You can't go to Sotto Sotto, hear a feature dish with meatballs, and not order them...you just can't.

Both of our entrees were absolutely fantastic.  The food here is so consistantly good that, as I had mentioned, I have yet to be disappointed in many visits over the years.

For dessert, Abigail had the chocolate mousse, and I went with the Banana Gelato w/strawberries.  A double espresso to top it off, and we were finished.

The service is very friendly, and reservations are an absolute must.  We had a 6:30pm reservation (couldn't get later with 5 days notice) and upon confirmation, they reiterated that my table would need to be free by approx. 8:30pm.  Two hours is a perfect window when dining with child anyhow.

Everything before tax was ~$156...taxes and tip brought us to an even $215.  For a fantastic meal and an experience that my daughter will always remember, I'd definitely do it again...it was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Dinner Take out 

Ambience: 4/5  
Food: 4/5 
Service: 3/5 (Friendly from takeout perspective)
Value: 3.5/5 
Repeat: Perhaps. If I want quality food, and time constrained, Sotto Sotto will be my pick."}
{"text":"Ordered the spaghetti and boyfriend got agnolotti with grilled octopus to start and carpaccio. 

They must have changed chefs because the food tastes like something you could get a cheaper Woodbridge bakery. Their wait staff is untrained for the price they charge. 

Tip: go to trattoria gian Carlo way better food and way better service."}
{"text":"OMG ! This place is FANTASTIC ! The atmosphere, the food and wait staff & manager too ! I don't know where to begin other than you cannot go wrong with anything here.

Was here last weekend visiting a friends and they brought us here, which is their favorite restaurant in Toronto. We had a great bottle of wine chosen by our server and started from there... 

We had a few apps that were DELICOUS ! Grilled Calamari was AMAZING ! We also had the Osso Bucco and literally melted in your mouth and had a great flavor. I had the 4 cheese Rigatoni, by far the best I've ever had and my boyfriend and girl friend got the Penne with Vodka sauce, ugh so good too ! Her fiancé got the Spaghetti Meat Sauce. Everything was amazing, even down to the dessert ! They had my absolute favorite dessert of chocolate mousse. Yumm !!! :) 

We sat early for dinner and was quiet. By 8pm. the place was full ! Be sure to make a reservation as this is a smaller restaurant and is known for their great food ! Definitely a spot I will be returning to when I go back in July ! Thanks Sotto Sotto for an amazing dinner !"}
{"text":"Sotto Sotto is a great restaurant for a lively, classy dinner. I took a significant other there for a special occasion, wanting to try a new restaurant. The room was louder than I typically prefer, and there wasn`t much space (nearly approaching the packed feel of Fresh) but the positive energy of the restaurant and its patrons made the volume ok for me, once I adjusted my expectations away from a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"Sotto Sotto more like Shitty Shitty.
Spent an anniversary here a few months ago with my boyfriend. We went in with an open mind... although, we had read rave reviews so we had some expectations that it would be a good meal at the very least.  

The atmosphere was unimpressive.  The waitstaff were girls talking about personal plans for weekend parties and were very inattentive and cold.  The head waitress ended up helping us (a middle aged woman who seemed swamped with work even though there were lots of waiters standing around ended up taking care of us... only seemed to care to a minimum... nothing outstanding. Basic). 

The food was poor.  I went for a salad and mushroom plate.  He went for a charcuterie plate and pasta dish.  My salad was basic, borderline pathetic.  The mushroom plate lacked flavour and had zero excitement.  The charcuterie plate was not true to the description.  The best part was the sliced pear garnish.  And his pasta was undercooked and hard.  They offered to make him a new dish but he was disappointed by the rest and wasn't in the mood anymore.  We will not come back here again.  

This establishment is not for us.  We'll stick to Mistura, The Keg, Pizza Libretto, and Jacobs.  Too many \"oops\" at this place."}
{"text":"I tried with all my might to go here during the film festival but alas, no such luck. (I was really in the mood for star gazing... of the hunky brad pit kind). So, instead, I booked a table for 12 for my birthday a few weeks ago. The table was great, we were all able to look at each other (as opposed to a long ass awkward table). Let me tell you, finding a place that didn't take a minimum and didn't make me offer my first born in order to have a table for 12 was a HUGE challenge and Sotto Sotto was so brilliant about it. 

I really loved my meal. I have the Beef Carpaccio to start which was delish!! The pasta dish I had (which had a garlic sauce... amazing) was outstanding. The service was really wonderful as well. Our server stayed on top of making sure everyone had what they needed and never let a glass go dry. 

This place truly is a little piece of Italy within Toronto. The decor is very quaint and with the kitchen exposed to the customer, you know exactly what's going on!

Also, even if it's not the film festival, you never know who you may run into here... I got the honours of rubbing shoulders with a few of the Toronto Blue Jays (if you know my BF, you will know this is a BIG DEAL!) 

This place will definitely because a regular go to restaurant for me as I can't remember a better birthday dinner experience."}
{"text":"We celebrated our wedding anniversary at Sotto Sotto over the G20 weekend and a very stormy evening. Despite the weather and the city being under siege the place was pretty crowded and although I had made reservations in advance we were seated at a table next to a large rambunctious party and our table was all wobbly. The food was great. We ordered the sea food platter as appetizer and shared it and then ordered the seafood risotto and shared that as well (yes we love seafood). I can't remember the dessert we had as it was quite unremarkable. I had mentioned that we are celebrating a milestone anniversary but there was no acknowledgement. The restaurant lacks attention to detail and finesse. Since I am not a celebrity junkie, I don't see any reason to return."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here since I got an awesome recommendation from a friend several months ago.  Now, I am kicking myself for not going here earlier.  It basically blew me away.  It's listed under Annex neighborhood, but really its bordering Yorkville and the Annex.

Took my girlfriend there for dinner.  The place was very cozy and romantic.  The decor and atmosphere reminded me of a couple of restaurants I been to in Italy.  They have an impressive collection of photographs of famous people that dined there.

Service was very friendly and attentive.  And the food was to die for.  We had an appetizer platter to share, main course and a desert each.  Portions were generous and we felt satisfied without feeling bloated or heavy, must be the quality ingredients used to prepare the dishes.

Finally,  considering the neighborhood, Sotto's reputation, and high quality of food served the prices are very reasonable.  I would highly recommend it and would return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We were in town for business. After a long work day we wanted a good meal to cap of the hard work. We chose this restaurant as it was walking distance to the hotel. However it was Saturday and 6:30pm, and we do not have a reservation. We asked the hostess of we could be seated and she was very obliging and found us a table, though we have to vacate in a hour. The waiter, Chris was very pleasant and remembered to split our bill, even the bottle of water we shared. He complimented on my ability to tackle my delicious brazino which I wanted whole. The salads were well dressed which is surprisingly a rarity even in good restaurants. We ran over the hour allotted but we were not rushed at all. The food was well prepared, service professional yet welcoming. And the hostess inquired about our meal as we left. All together a very pleasant experience, we will definitely return for a second round."}
{"text":"I am not quite sure why this basement restaurant gleans such good reviews, except that the quality of everything is excellent.
$300 for two, with a couple of bottles of wine. 
Lovely pasta to start, ( Parpadelle),  followed by a luscious sole and then a veal.  Plenty of people queuing to take our place."}
{"text":"This used to be my 'good restaurant' of choice for a few years. Great place for romantic dates, anniversaries and the like until everyone else started using it for the same, which is not a bad thing. Well, it was for me as I noticed the prices creep up a bit. 

The locale is set underground in a basement, however they have given it a very cave like feel. A very well addressed cave mind you. With low-ceilings, lots of yellow lighting and a level service which never disappointed me, I can only give this restaurant high praises. 

The chairs are wooden and the tables have an old world vibe. Funny enough, the decor strikes me more as Mediterranean than strictly souther Italian as I once was at a restaurant in Sevilla that looked just like this place. 

Now, the restaurant is on the small side so expect to feel it a little cramped on Friday and Saturday nights when is generally packed. For some privacy, I recommend the small room on the north-east side of the restaurant on the room on the right. Only a few tables there and a bit less server traffic.

The wine selection is very good and their pastas & desserts (their forte) can achieve levels of culinary orgasm  -- sometimes. Either way, expect the Italian style meal where you will have an aperitivo, antipasti, primo, secondo.. etc all the way to Caffè or Digestivo. So by the end, expect to be feel full & satisfied.   

Of course you pay for it, so for a great meal for two, expect a good $200 as base. I very much recommend Sotto Sotto to anyone who wants a semi-authentic rustic Italian meal.

Fun fact: Even though Sotto Sotto's menu is Italian, the place is basically run by Spanish people. Hola!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful client dinner.  Service, food and wine were terrific.  The intimate setting was wonderful too."}
{"text":"The best in Toronto , I've been  to this restaurant more than 6 years now , I love it, La nona I love u!"}
{"text":"My husband travels to Toronto on business and I was lucky enough to tag-a-long on his most recent trip. He asked his Toronto based contacts for suggestions of the best Italian restaurant in the area and one highly recommended Sotto Sotto.  Absolutely a find! It is a darling restaurant situated in the \"basement\" of a beautiful multi-story building. The atmosphere was very friendly yet quite elegant. Great combination. The food was delicious! I  had a very difficult time deciding on what to order as the menu had many authentic italian dishes that i so wanted to try. I decided on carpaccio and pasta with homemade bolognese sauce. Great choice! My husband had the Caesar salad and a special pasta with asparagus and salmon and loved it. Although I loved my meal I am looking forward to trying the roasted lamb on \"our\" next business trip (I had lamb the night before). By the way, the ambience was very conducive to a romantic for two, however, I saw groups of 6-8 that were enjoying themselves as well. Can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here with my parents and we all enjoyed our meal very much. A respectable wine list, good service and good food. While this may not seem like something to write home about, unfortunately, in so many of these allegedly \"high end\" places, it is. 

The price was right for what we had and despite the movie star cliental the wait staff lacked that arrogance so common in Toronto."}
{"text":"Perfect. Was a bit concerned as I haven't been in a few years and read through some of the reviews on service and attitude etc. But my experience was perfect - except we couldn't reorder the same bottle of wine. They were out. That happens. Our server Paul was excellent. Just the right touch. Everyone working there was friendly. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good Italian food. Not as good as it should be for the prices. Ambience is really nice. Service was very mediocre. I have it 3/5 as I much prefer other restaurants at this price range."}
{"text":"The food here is really delicious and prices are reasonable to high. Definitely something on the menu for everyone. Service is ok. The place is warm, cozy and romantic. Perfect for a date! However, some days it can be a bit crowded. Will always go back, this is a one of a kind in Toronto."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I did not have a great experience at Sotto Sotto. Was there just a few weeks ago and received such a bad and snobby treatment from the host and waiters that I decided to leave even before they put some bread on my table. It was that bad.
I have been to sister resto Spuntini, and this is not the case, not sure why Sotto Sotto is such a snobby restaurant. What I do know is that I will never put up with bad service...and to their disadvantage they lost on a good review from me and for them to make it to the Foodies Inc. blog. 

Viviana."}
{"text":"Great place for talking women and vino."}
{"text":"Such a cute and quaint little spot. It was me and my boyfriends anniversary and we got a nice table for 2 by the window. Great for watching all the luxury cars being handed over to the valet!

We started off with the antipasto gordonia, which is a seafood platter. SOOO GOOD! The calamari and shrimp was grilled and spiced perfectly. Our waitress said it's for 2, but I could've eaten it all on my own. 

My boyfriend got the capellini nazini, which is angel hair pasta, rose sauce with shrimp and arugula. He had gotten the main size, which was perfect for his appetite. I wish I had gotten it. It was so delicious! The shrimp was seasoned, not just plain which I loved. Perfect!

I got the papparoelle dei castelli, egg noodles with mushrooms, but the appetizer size, which is perfect for a small appetite like mine. The dish was very plain. Not much flavor to be honest. If I ever come back, I'm def getting the capellini naZini!

We ended the night with the creme caramel. Everyone raves of the tiramisu, but I've had it so many times everywhere else, so I'm not sure how amazing it is. But the creme caramel was nothing special. Maybe I should've gotten it. Next time!

This place is perfect for special occasions. Honestly the price wasn't too bad, I was thinking this would've broken the bank, but then again we really didn't get their meat or seafood dish."}
{"text":"Another fine-dining favourite! I love this place. Like FIVE STARS love it, as you can see.

Great, cozy atmosphere - fabulous place to impress a date. AHEM! 

Officially it's called \"Sotto Sotto Trattoria\", so you know what kind of food you're in for.

My favourite apps are the grilled wild mushrooms and the cheese plate. The bread is (obviously) fantastic too.

My fave salad is the Carlos, though I think I've tried most of them and they're all great.

I've had a bite or two of other people's gnocchi and it's fab as well. No real idea personally about the pasta or the meat entrees, but everyone always swoons over whatever it is they have ordered, so I think every option is a safe bet here. I've also thieved bites of various desserts, which are all impressive... especially the berry flambé... I have a weak spot for dramatics, what can I say?

But, really, three of these stars are for three simple words:

DELLA SPIGA RISOTTI.

Oh my dog it's good. Seriously. SERIOUSLY.

I would go so far as to say it may be the best wild mushroom/truffle risotto in the city (sorry, 2nd place Mistura, it's really close).

I just wish people took me out here more often!!!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his Birthday in November. I made reservations pre seeing a play.
The restaurant is very small and initimate. We were seated a little close to the kitchen... so we shuffled our seats a little.
The waiter was very attentive (although we saw about 3 different waiters)
The spaghetti was delicious!!
The appetizers were tasty. The dessert was yummy but nothing out of this world.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mouth watering food but super expensive. I would give it 5 stars if it was slightly more affordable. The Dulce de Leche Cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"best grilled fish I've had in a long time! and love the fact that you can order 1/2 plates of pasta.  pasta + fish...perfect!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a \"celebrity\" place with pictures all over the walls of the owner with the likes of Brad Pitt and many many others going waaaay back. 

As I walked in I felt like I was walking into a NYC Italian restaurant - small, quaint and narrow. There's no waiting area or place to comfortably stand while waiting for a table. The small narrow walkway allows you to see the long narrow kitchen and the chefs hard at work. I loved the place right off the bat because of the atmosphere. 

There were 9 of dining on this night and we walked in without reservations. The staff was extremely friendly and was able to pull together an area for our group. From the host to the waiter the entire visit was enjoyable. 

I had the Bolognese Mamma Laura. The food was absolutely wonderful and authentic.  There wasn't one complaint from the other 8 dining with me. All of them from various places around the world said this was truly some of the best food they have eaten. I would have to agree. There isn't a place in Austin that I know of that can deliver such high quality fresh Italian food."}
{"text":"Ate here over the weekend with my girlfriends. 

Upon first impression, it had a dark atmospheric vibe that was somewhat romantic, but also very cramped and squished... It felt like dining in a cave, but with 40 other people crammed together. We were seated at one of the room entrances, so I had to sit pressed up against the table the whole time, or would've been constantly bombarded by dishes and guests hitting my head.

Our waiter was friendly and attentive.

The Amalfi Risotto (seafood) $48.95 was HUGE! On the menu it states it's for 2 people and would take 30-45 minutes to prepare. It looked more like portions for 3-4 people.  large pieces of seafood though, so that was greatly appreciated.

We also had the Sea Bass ($38.95?). You can't really go wrong with that.  The skin was crispy and seasoned with a lot of salt... I didn't mind the salt, but my friends thought it was excessive. The size of the fish itself was quite small compared to anywhere else I've had it and also considering the hefty price. 

Also had the ear-shaped pasta (Orecchiette All'Ortolana) and it was good. Really reminded me of my trip to Italy last year. Didn't have much sauce on it, but didn't need any more either. 

They ran out of tiramisu dessert, which made one of my friend's super sad because she's absolutely obsessed with tiramisu. Thankfully they had panna cotta though, which is our second go-to dessert.

All in all, a pretty neat experience. Would've enjoyed it more had the venue been more spacious."}
{"text":"i went there for my birthday a few years ago.  the food was decent enough, but not what I was expecting.  The menu was a bit expensive for what I would pay, and I felt they may have skimped on the fresh ingredients.

Overall....just okay.  Would only go back if the prices dropped."}
{"text":"This was easily the best meal and dining experience my husband and I have had this year. We loved the cozy European atmosphere. Our waiter treated us like he was our best friend. He didn't like the way the fresh mozzarella looked that day so he advised against an appetizer with that. He created a combination of dinner items for my husband that wasn't on the menu and it was amazing. Thinking about the pasta carbonara I had is making my mouth water as I write this.  Everything is incredibly fresh, the grill is a few short feet away and we saw our food come off the flames and to our table steaming. 
Only criticism is the tables are packed in too tight. You feel like you are eating with strangers because their table is 1 foot away from yours. However, I quickly got over it when I bit into my bruschetta. 
Call a few weeks in advance to get a table at a time you want."}
{"text":"As you can probably tell by now, I eat out A LOT and I love good food. I'm happy to indulge in expensive meals, if they are worth it. 

And Sotto Sotto is worth it. Every time.

This is a very traditional Italian restaurant:
- The ceilings are low. 
- The waiters are genuine and friendly (and yes, they clean the crumbs off the table!)
- The lighting is dim. 
- The patrons are quiet and discreet.
- And most importantly, the food - i.e., PASTA is INCREDIBLE.

Food selection can be tough as the menu is large and everything looks good. I'd go for:
- Antipasto to start
- Capellini or Pappardelle pasta dishes as mains
- Tiramisu (without a doubt) for dessert.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The night started with their manager telling us \"it's not 50% off tonight\". It took us a while to process this as I didn't think someone would call me poor for walking into their establishment. Keeping in mind we were dressed well - we are professors. The server was non-existent and was making remarks about my brother's illness. At the end of the meal the server straight up insulted my brother because of his disability. The manager didn't care and treated us like peasants. 

The food was alright. We left hungry and made."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance ! Great food as always ! Yet I do miss the old building . Nevertheless having moved to LA it was great come home to"}
{"text":"Really, really, really, good- friendly service, romantic (although I ate alone, and they were very nice!), great authentic, rustic Italian food.  PErhaps a little pricey, but that's what you get when you have limited seating and great food. I stumbled into this place on a walk and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"OK seriously this place was ridiculous. One of the best meals of all time. So much food and I could barely dent but YUM! This is my first time visiting Sotto Sotto and I loved it! I ate there just recently with a friend from Toronto who recommended this restaurant. 

The atmosphere is amazing, with the rustic architecture and dimmed lighting. It's a very beautiful restaurant that's located underground, it gives you the sense you're in an old wine cellar. My friend lives in Toronto and this is his favorite place. He is french and really picky so if he compliment your sauce you know you've done something right. I really love that their pasta dishes are authentic Italian pasta dishes that do not swim in sauce as we do in America! PFFFFFFFFF!!! GROSS!!!

I had the spaghetti scoglio ( I dont know if I spelled it correctly) but its pasta mixed w seafood, it was really good, and the pasta was cooked perfectly, we shared the seafood grill platter, my favorite was the grilled calamari ahhhh so amazing, we shared the gnocchi with rose sauce, it was also very good and we also shared bites of various desserts which were all extraordinary and they also have soy ice creams which were so rich and creamy, my favorite was the hazelnut soy ice cream. They use a lot of local ingredients which I like because its important to me. My friend from L.A came with me and she loved the place as well, everyone enjoyed every dish they had, and we had so much fun dining at this place. The waiters were very nice, not to mention service was very quick. I guess you could say I had a scenic view since Javier Bardem was sitting at the table across from mine ;) Overall, amazing little place with authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend (8/26/2012) on a Sunday night while traveling through Toronto.  My girlfriend and I did not have reservations, but the staff was very accommodating and we were seated immediately (although I found out afterwards that this is very uncommon due to the popularity of this restaurant).  The atmosphere is very quaint and pleasing, although the ceilings are somewhat low for anyone in the 6'+ height range.

I must say state absolutely that this meal was one of the best Italian meals I have had, EVER!  Surpasses NYC Little Italy and even the real McCoy from the homeland.  I highly recommend the following dishes that we enjoyed:

-Pasta Carbonara: Exquisite dish, but I recommend having the appetizer portion due to its richness.  Phenomenal pancetta...Addition of some snow peas might be a nice contrast to the richness, but nevertheless this dish is a must if you go.

-Polenta with Wild Mushrooms: Very nice polenta in an interesting bar form.  The mushrooms had a very rustic, earthy taste that permeated the polenta.

-Veal Saltimboca: One of the finest cuts of veal that I have ever had...very thin and tender.  Superb seasoning of the cutlets and very well complimented with the prosciutto.  Fresh vegetables were flash sauteed on the side of the dish and offered a very nice contrast to the richness of the dish.  This is a must have if you enjoy veal!

-Tiramissu:  Although I am not a huge dessert fan, this tiramissu was also excellent and my girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed it.  Very nice chocolate and fresh berries to compliment the desert.

Our only complaint about this fine establishment was their price inflated wine list.  It is hard if not impossible to find a full bottle for anything less than $60.  In fact a great majority of their bottles are hovering in the $300-600 range,  many were even up to the $1000 range.  I found this somewhat discouraging since there are a plethora of delicious and respectable wines available in the $30-75 range.  Availability of more affordable wine would have positively influenced my experience. 

I beg you all to please do yourself a favor and go to Sotto Sotto, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very small place that is extremely busy even with a reservation. Ambiance is classic and traditional but tight space that can be loud. Food is very fresh, especially anything with seafood in it. Wait staff, hostess, manager super friendly. High price for food is worth it."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, but the fact that I am still posting it is a testament.  I live in LA now, so I haven't been back for almost 7 years, but this is hands-down one of two places that serves the best tiramisu I've ever had in my life.  In fact, I'm afraid to order tiramisu on anyone's menu now because I feel like anything else will pale in comparison.  I don't remember what I had for dinner specifically (although I do remember it being delicious), but I DO remember how creamy and pudding like the tiramisu was.  To DIE for.
It is small and crowded and somewhat loud because of it, but that is part of the charm of this place.  That is what makes it cool.  2 snaps up in a circle, baby!"}
{"text":"My fiance picked this place for our second anniversary and it was a wonderful pick! I was a bit apprehensive as we are a young couple who are university aged and I really didn't want to deal with the snooty servers mentioned in other reviews. Maybe we dressed well or something because we didn't have to deal with that. 

It's the small touches like the hostess taking my coat that really makes this place. My least favourite thing about the experience would be the space. I think they made the best out of it to fit their theme but it felt too crowded. In any case that was soon forgotten as we enjoyed our food.

I ordered the special, Ossobuco. He ordered the Vitello Balsamico. Both of our dishes were spectacular. The lamb in my dish was so tender and fall apart that I didn't have to use my knife on it, it gave away like butter. My guys dish was smothered in a generous serving of mushrooms. Flavours were all there! My dish was missing the polenta and the server was quick to correct it but didn't really take ownership that it was a mistake, it felt like he was doing me a favour by bringing out a component of my dish. It wasn't done in a rude way but I would've appreciated an apology.

For dessert, I ordered the Pistachio Panacotta and he ordered the Tiramisu. They were both spectacular. The tiramisu was so decadent and the panacotta so refreshing!

Yes, this place is expensive but I think for a special occasion it's worth it. I thought our food was great and service was good."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend w the bf
He's never tried it but was looking forward to try it from my parents great review!
We dIdnt't have res but was on yorkville and called asking if they had a table for 2 in about 15 mns if we walked down.  The guy on the phone said no problem and when we got there a table was ready right in the corner, perfect for people watching :)
My bfloved it, of course. We ordered a lot, portions are small-medium, which allows you to try different things. 
We started ordering around 9:45pm and stayed until 11:30pm the restaurant was still packed and people were even getting seated after 11pm which was great :)
Def would come back again"}
{"text":"Hand down one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to. Food, atmosphere and service all perfect. 

Came here for dinner on a trip to Toronto and wasn't disappointed. It's a very small restaurant that doesn't jump out at you while walking down the street. You walk down some stairs into a dimly lit room with pictures of various celebrities who have visited on the wall. It's a very intimate setting and a great place to come with a date. FYI, a reservation is absolutely needed.

I had the Pennette Via Frattina which is penne with wood smoked salmon and asparagus. The most delicious italian dish I've ever had. A bold statement to make, but everything about the dish was perfect. Sauce was absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. Also had the Gamberetti Limone for appetizer which is shrimp in wine sauce with fresh lemon. Absolutely lights out. Both meals were about as perfect as you can get.

I think this is the perfect place frankly. Delicious food and intimate atmosphere in a really cool part of town. This was by far the stand out meal on this trip and I haven't had an italian meal thats been comparable ever since. My advice: Make a reservation and get to this place immediately. Likely one of the best restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's always a special treat to dine at Sotto Sotto.  Love the food, atmosphere and especially the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake!  It's very cozy and reminds of someplace in Europe."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian meals I've had in Canada!  We came here for a business dinner, and they gave us a nice secluded table by the front window.  It was near the door, but the curtains successfully blocked out the cold, and made us feel important.

I tried the risotto, the calamari/seafood insalata (amazing), and the seafood spaghetti with white wine sauce.  All were outstanding!  For dessert, we had the dessert special, which was the best cannoli I've ever had - they MUST add this as a regular menu item!

The service was friendly, casual, and very helpful.  We all had very enjoyable meals, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for medicore food. Service impersonal. Felt processed. Too noisy to hear my date. Went 30 years ago, & wont go back for another 30."}
{"text":"Came to Toronto for Business and went to a few spots.
This spot was amazing.
Got Seafood Risotto, Wine, Spaghetti Carbonara, and Grill Platter.
Carbonara was one of the best I have ever had, and the RIsotto was amazing.
The seafood was super fresh and grilled to perfection, with a nice char grilled taste.
A must eat in Toronto"}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE - YES.  AWESOME - YES!

Bobby, you know Dinero, yeah - we've dined here.  Not together, but we like this place.  It is THE place!  A place to gawk at celebrities and the pretty people.  A place to get both delicious and fresh food, made to order, with accomodating & very attentive service.  They have an expansive wine selection, and offer two different dining area experiences.  The top floor, with several window-view tables overlooking the busy Avenue Road...is more traditional dining and tends to be quiet.  The downstairs area makes YOU feel like a celebrity.  Loud, intimate, all action, a romantic-setting, and GREAT!

I had the pleasure of dining here several times, and would love to go back again (and again) when visiting Toronto.  Love Sotto Sotto!"}
