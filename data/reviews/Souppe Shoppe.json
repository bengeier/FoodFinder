{"text":"my all time favorite soup shop! i work near by and her soups are always so flavourful and delicious. definitely worth trekking out in winter for right now. i'm eaing clam chowder...and its so damn good. the owner is such a sweet pea!"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to lunch spot! Her soups change regularly. Everything is homemade, natural, seasonal and fresh. She has cool creations like a white cheddar cheese pop tart. Today I had chicken Thai soup, the broth was so flavourful and it was packed with chicken and mushrooms yum! I also had the molasses lemonade which was an interesting twist and tasted very fresh. I've also had the lentilism soup which was very hardy with a curry flair. She caters to meat lovers, vegetarians, gluten free you name it- she'll have a delish homemade filling soup for you. $10 buys you a combo, soups around $6.50 for a good size."}

During my visit, the weather was hot, a bit humid even, and it reminded me of a mini Portland, OR.

Anyway, Jenny runs this stall that sells primarily soups w/ accoutrement (crouton/Guyere pop tart) that she makes + some homemade freezies in \"adult\" flavours (no dayglo frozen sugar rods) + lemonade.

I tried a Cab Sauv and mixed berry freezie ($3, delish), and a Seafood Stew w/ the cheese pop tart to go ($7.50).  I just finished the soup for dinner and it was soo good with nice chunks of salmon, scallops, baby clams, mussels, etc.  Honestly, it was better than anything that I ate at the AYCE sushi for lunch!

Great value and super friendly service!  Will definitely check out again.  :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, definitely the most tasty soup in the city.  The beef bulalo soup is INCREDIBLE, but so is their aubergine dream (when it's in season).  Chef Jenny puts so much love and are into the soup and the most amazing part is she makes different homemade croutons specific for each soup.  SO GOOD!"}
