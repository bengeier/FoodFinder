{"text":"Meh, we went to the Sunday brunch today (March 10) I was disappointed to say the least. I had been a few years back and it was superb, but I think there must be new chefs or something because the food really wasn't that great. The garlic mashed potatoes were nasty, tasted like they were made out of a box and had a thick layer of grease sitting on top. The French toast had a very different flavour or maybe lacked flavour. The variety of food is really good however, with so much of it just tasting meh it is disappointing. There is an eggs benedict station and that was ok, a little salty. There is also a flambay (sp) station which was excellent. The chocolate fountain was good with the fruit. For $50 for 2 people we didn't think it was worth it at all."}
{"text":"So this place is growing on me... stuck in the hotel 2 weeks now, breakfast, lunch and dinner have been tried.   One thing I have found is that the staff are very good and they try to manage all us customers very well.  Price wise the place is acceptable, especially the buffet,  a bit high for the menu breakfasts, but not unreasonable for a hotel.  When In Calgary I find the combination of the location, hotel, and this restaurant my favorite pick... and I come here a fair bit.  Eating here can be a nice experiance when staying here. It meets my expectations completely."}
{"text":"Only giving one star because zero is not a possibility. Booked a party of eleven for Mother's Day brunch, part of our group came down with stomach flu the night before. When I called to reduce the number on the reservation, they insisted that I would still be charged for the full number of people because I didn't give 24 hours notice. Manager was extremely rude, used profanity. Customer service professionals know that a little flexibility is part of good customer service; there are no customer service professionals employed at this dump."}
