{"text":"The only reason we ordered from Lin Garden was because our usual Chinese take-out place was under construction. The vegetable spring rolls were good, but the rest of the food was meh at best. I don't eat meat, but those
who did were not impressed, and one even ended up spitting it out. Our order of crab ran goon came still frozen in the center....gross"}
{"text":"We eat here about once a month and have not been disappointed yet. You get plenty of food for leftovers the next day. Everything is piping hot. If you order a certain amount of food, you qualify for free items. It's a nice touch. We have tried several several items & most are as close to authentic as you can get. The workers are also very nice."}
{"text":"Why is this place listed as closed? It's a neat little gem tucked away in the wasteland of Northfield. Never fails to satisfy. Egg-Fu-Yung...Orange Chicken...Lo Mein. Don't be afraid to order anything on the menu...it's always a hit and never a miss."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, conveniently located.  Always fresh, hot, and very tasty!  Love the House Special Lo Mein and the General Tsoa's     Chicken!  Give the soups a try too!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from them yesterday and overall not very good.  Had the food delivered.  Food came quickly but was a mixed bag.

My wife had sesame chicken which were like little rocks, completely dry and over cooked.  Total shit if you ask me.

I had the Mongolian Beef which was not the best I have had, but was decent.  It was spicy like I asked for which was good.

The house fried rice was some of the worst I have ever had, just tasted strange and was way too moist if you can believe that, like it wasn't cooked enough.

The free cheese won tons with the coupon we had was basically fried air.

White rice was ok and fortune cookies were not stale like you usually see at Chinese restaurants.

I will be sticking with Wing Wah and will most likely never order from here again.  Not good at all."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Chinese takeouts anywhere! The food is consistently fresh, the portions are huge, and the staff is always friendly , especially the woman who really makes an effort to fill orders quickly and correctly.I have yet to find a better place."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and this is the first place Chinese place I tried and I was not disappointed. One of the best places I've had singing living in the Cleveland area. I will absolutely be going back. (Delivery was pretty fast too)"}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR NEW CHINA KING WHICH USED TO BE LIN GARDEN.

THEY CLAIM TO BE UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT 

WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND NEW CHINA KING WHEN I SEARCHED FOR IT ON YELP


I should learn my lesson by now and just stick to what I know is good. There were a bunch of flyers for a new restaurant by my apartment door so I grabbed one. Since I am always willing to try a new place I called and placed an order that sampled a little bit of everything. The woman on the phone was very nice and the ordering process was very easy. 

The delivery arrived about 45 minutes later and I was excited to try food from what I thought was a new Chinese restaurant. I really should have looked online before just blindly ordering. 

When I unpacked the bag I noticed that they forgot to put any sauces in the bag. Strike one! I took out one of the shrimp egg rolls and noticed that it was very small. it was the size that most Chinese buffets serve which is at least a third smaller than a normal sized egg roll. I had a problem with this because their egg rolls were 15 cents more than the full size egg rolls I get from my fave place. Another strike! Not only was the size disappointing but in the entire egg roll there were 2 pieces, not whole shrimp mind you, but two half pieces of shrimp. Strike 3! Okay, so I said well I will try the other stuff maybe it was just one that didn't get much shrimp in it. Next I opened my General Tso's chicken and it was swimming in an overly sweet liquidy sauce which I specifically requested be put in a container on the side so that the chicken pieces wouldn't get soggy. You guessed it...strike! The roast pork and broccoli was pretty good except for the sauce also being on the thin side. Good flavor though. My shrimp egg foo young was another disaster. It only contained a few whole shrimp and I was picking out shrimp shells as I ate it. That turned me off so bad I ended up throwing the third piece in the garbage.

So I looked online and found out that the name of the restaurant had been changed from Lin Garden to New China King. Their website http://www.lingardenlakewood.com/home-page/  says that they were formally Lin Garden and also down the page a bit it says new owner, new management. If indeed there is a new owner I hope they shape up because I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM OR EAT HERE AGAIN. The more I think about it the more I feel like I was bamboozled. Hey let's just change the name and tell people there's a new owner and manager and maybe they won't notice the same crappy food we made under the old name.

IF YOU WANT REALLY GOOD CHINESE FOOD GO TO PEKING RESTAURANT AT 18198 SLOAN AVE IN LAKEWOOD. BEST CHINESE TAKE-OUT IN LAKEWOOD AND THEY ALWAYS STUFF THE CONTAINERS FULL."}
{"text":"I work in Northfield. Occasionally I get lunch at Lin Garden. I don't know how it came to be, but I decided to try every lunch item. Well, mission accomplished. I have had L1 to L27 on my personal Lin Garden menu. Every one was delicious. When I went to the restaurant with my menu to show the girl my take-out menu with all the items checked off, she told me \"you have an old menu, now we have 28 lunch entrees\". So my old menu is full and now I'll order L28. Got a new take-out menu too!"}
{"text":"One of Lakewoods worst.
Let's just say the food was by far some of the worst - I ordered pork egg foo young and it honestly did not taste like eggs.  The gravy that accompanies it, tasted more like stale oil than anything else. 
With that out of the way, they packaged the two sauces that came with our meal in very cheap Styrofoam and were stacked together in a baggy.  The heat was so great, I presume due to them microwaving the sauce, that it deteriorated the cover on the bottom sauce causing it to fall into my gravy. If this was it I would have been cool with the scenario but the top broke into a few pieces leaving me to pick them all out.  
However, the worst part was that the top container, with the molten sauce, also melted the bottom of its container. Unbeknownst to me, the little pressure that my pinky put on the container caused it to fully rupture giving me a 2nd degree burn.
That was a bad way for them to save money - by using the worst possible storage container. 
And stop microwaving food!"}
{"text":"Best value and best tasting Chinese food I have found in Northern Summit County.  We had delicious chicken broccoli and chicken cashew. Pork egg rolls very good too."}
{"text":"Love this place! For what it is, it's the best I've had! Who doesn't love Chinese take out? I always order the Singapore Mei Fung and sometimes we get the General Tso or Hunan Chicken (can't go wrong with any of them but they are spicy!)  

Every single time we order they arrive at my house in less than 30 minutes, it's magic! I can't cook dinner that fast most nights.

Also, if you order a minimum amount ($15 I think) you get free crab rangoons, which are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I wanted to try a new place for Chinese take out, so I googled chinese restaurants. This place had the most good reviews, so I decided to try it. The lady want EXTREMELY nice, over the phone and when I went to pick up the food. It was done relatively quickly, but when I walked in, I wanted to walk right back out, without the food. There were dead fish floating around the fish tank, with two dead fish stuck to the filter. So gross. There was also a thick layer of greasy dust all over everything-the counters, the empty plastic container sitting on the counter...I was so grossed out, and that's all I could think about when I started to eat the food. I got the garlic chicken and my boyfriend got the general tso's chicken. We also got the steamed dumplings. I couldn't eat more then 3 bites of my food because I kept thinking about how dirty it was. I tried to eat some one the steam dumplings, but it didn't even seem like they were cooked all the way through. I was about to put my in the fridge and attempt to eat it the next day for lunch. Instead, I threw it away and made my boyfriend take out the trash so I wouldn't have to smell it. While I had some outstanding customer service, unless they have a serious cleaning crew come in, there is no way I can order from there again."}
{"text":"Just from taste i can tell the breading on the chicken was done a previous day and also chicken is rubbery which means its a low grade fatty meat. Disgusting food, not to mention way over priced."}
