{"text":"What a cool lunch spot! The prosciutto with fig jam pannini and their special Beef & Veggie soup served with a horseradish vinaigrette was so good I almost couldn't stop myself (but saved the other half for the other half to try so we'd come back!) Definitely coming back as the other menu items, including breakfast, looks yummy!"}
{"text":"Nice place good food and great coffee started off my morning giving this place a try & ill defiantly be back for more ."}
{"text":"Since I live in the area I have seen this place a million times and yet never dropped in until now. Noticed the owner had changed something told me to stop in. I am

so glad I listened my gut. The atmosphere is charming, the menu enticing and the service just perfect.  I had requested a apple tarte for dessert when a voice from behind the counter suggested I have the\" garash\" instead. I was pleasantly surprised to hear the recommendartion. The presentation was appealing and the dessert decadent! I was even offered a sample of their oh so delishious Bisquit Cake, which is worth a trip The Strip View Cafe in itself! I recommended this restaurant to every one I spoke to today! Wishing them much success"}
{"text":"This place is  really bad  I cannot put into words as well as Danny G has put it but let me summarize the waitstaff is very inexperienced they can't follow instructions as simple as do not put mustard on the sandwich when you call they do not even comprehend what you're trying to complain about to summarize it I will never return to pay for their overpriced not very good food ever again this place pretty much Rob to you if you want to better view read danny G"}
{"text":"Their food and service are awesome. I love the tomato basil soup. The prices are great considering the freshness of the food. The place is clean, the decor and the music make the place feel comfortable. If you order on the phone make sure they get your order right."}
{"text":"O.m.g the best branch I ever had.
So me and my wife came here often today I ordered the mixed Green salad with tuna no word's
And 2 eggs any style
Only for 20$ it's so nice to go out and not spend all over
That is a must go placed
Oh I checked in and got free esperso"}
{"text":"Great place to go chill have a cup of coffee. They usually open at 10 but if Jezabel is there she'll let you come in and have coffee while they set up. Great service from everyone. Jezabel and the red head girl I don't know her name but they are both awesome!!!!!!!!! Love coming to this place while doing work from my lap top. I can sit here for hrs and feel relax. The food is amazing and the decor is so inviting!"}
{"text":"This place has seriously gone down hill. We used to like it.  Now the service sucks.  Twice we went in and no one waited on us for 15 minutes... and they weren't busy... Just rude. So twice we left... Never to return.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing , such fresh ingredients you can tell everything is homemade. The staff treats you great. The cafe is a must"}
{"text":"Impressed!  My panini and soup were scrumptious.  I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu.  Nice decor.  I hope this place does well.  I think its a winner!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is always better than you would expect.  The service is warm and what you would want a family owned cafe."}
{"text":"My husband and I randomly decided to stop here today and we were not disappointed. I'm almost always slightly disappointed when I eat out but I left here with very satisfied taste buds. I got the chicken and pesto panini with their mixed greens side salad. The dressing on the salad could have been slightly more robust but it was still really good and fresh. It tasted like a basil dressing of some sort. The panini was amazing though!!!  Nice and thick with good quality chicken, amazing pesto and really flavorful crunchy bread as the outside of the panini. I left feeling perfectly full and satisfied. My husband came out to the car and surprised me with two desserts to eat on the go. Again I was amazed at the quality. The cheesecake was just perfect and the mascarpone did not disappoint either. Both were DELICIOUS!   I will definitely be returning. I love finding small cafes to support... Especially when it means I get to eat amazingly delicious food."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing selection of paninis and salad. Fantastic lunch spot! Cozy coffee shop with a view of the strip. Love this place and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Don't let this place be a \"best kept secret\" if great diners in Las Vegas. Great panini's, soup, and desert."}
{"text":"RATING: A -

SERVICE: A 

AMBIANCE: B - 

OVERVIEW: The place itself has very limited seating. The decor is very unique and makes the place look lively. I ordered a Vanilla honey latte, which in fact was pretty darn good. I also ordered an Italian sausage cheesesteak, which was as good as it looks. The service was great and resourceful. Will definitely stop back in when I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent Omelette! Wow, this was one of the best omelettes I've had. They let you build your own from a wide array of ingredients. The plate is served with a deep green,leafy side salad with extraordinary House Dressing. This dressing is a must try. 

I will be back to try some of their house specialties from their wide selection."}
{"text":"You guys & gals looking for that local coffee spot with great coffee and food as well, come here. I'm telling you I've never been disappointed. Cappucinnos are awesome, the honey vanilla iced latte is awesome, the soup, the desserts, the.....just try it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery while i was at work. Tried here for the first time. I'm a little further than there delivery area, but they came anyway. I had a panini and salad. The sandwich was soooo good! It was crispy on outside not soggy at all. I was upset i had to share my food with a coworker lol. Also got the Marscapone cake.. Holy Crap it was good! Definitely will order again from here and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place for lunch. Sandwiches, Paninis, salads, soups...all delicious. Interior is decorated nicely, good ambiance...very comfortable. I recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered from them for lunch to my job. The delivery took about an hour and twenty minutes so I wasn't thrilled about that, but when the food finally came it was too delicious for words of you're going to eat here I suggest the in store experience the food is defiantly awesome."}
{"text":"I created account just for adding the review for this cute cozy cafe. My friend and I had a great time at this place and I liked it so much!! The drinks, music, atmosphere, decoration....We only spent $10 there for one large cameral latte and one large hot chocolate and my friend gave $7 tips just because we liked it so much!! I felt so sweet and happy of being that place in that cold weather. And of course, have to give some credits to my special friend for that wonderful experience too. :)

The location is not that great, I guess that's why not as popular as it should be. I did recommend this place to my friend who is going to visit during new year with his wife and I'm sure they will enjoy it too."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and nice patio!
Interior is very nice and the staff is friendly. Service is excellent . One of my favorite places around. Thanks Strip view !"}
{"text":"Homemade soups and wonderful Panini sandwiches.  The Tuna Melt is wonderful.  I have enjoyed everything that I have ordered here.  Great for Lunch."}
{"text":"This cafe is off Spring Mtn and Rainbow near Greenland. They have a cute patio outside for customers to hang out at and I was surprised by the interior. Their cobblestone interior is SO cute and gives me that home-y feeling. They also have really cool light fixtures. They're really chill about seating so when we walked in we picked wherever we wanted to sit at. They also play music, but it's not overly loud to the point where we can't talk to each other. This would be a great study place honestly. 

I ordered a breakfast croissant with avocado, bacon, and provolone and a berry smoothie which was made fresh and not overly sweet. They definitely didn't skip out on the avocado and the croissant was huge. It was definitely a filling meal! You get what you pay for. 

Will definitely stop by again to try their meatball sub next time! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some winter warmth! 

There weren't a lot of ppl in the cafe on a Sunday afternoon but it's ok. It was nice to have it be so quiet. The decor is shabby chic and I love that it felt so familiar and cozy. Seems like a great locals spot. 

We had cappuccinos and they were amazing and huge and get them when you get there. Trust me... Get them. I want to try all the flavors and the latte. 

I had the Fig and Prosciutto panini, it was okay...it's probably my own fault but I love all those items and forgot that the fig was going to be super incredibly sweet. The bread was amazing. I don't think I'll get this panini again personally, but I do want to go back and try the other ones. Possibly update my review with a panini that's more to my liking. 

Ok the tomato soup is amazing. I love soup and chowders and I loved their tomato soup!! It was warm and creamy, hit the spot on a cold day! 

The Tiramisu was freaking delicious, get it. Even if you just the desert and cappuccino it's worth a go. 

I'll have to come back in the summer and eat outside, they have a cute patio area. Pricing was really good!! I think for the quality of food i'd be willing to pay more. So win win!!"}
{"text":"There are only two breakfast choices on the menu. Some of the lunch sandwiches are good but I went for breakfast this time. Even with 2 choices I've gone for breakfast a few times because the coffee was good and the bacon was great. This time the coffee was different and not great. The bacon is no longer the thick cut real bacon that kept me coming back bits now paper thin and tastes like it's been microwaved. And I'm really not impressed with a huge pile of green salad with my small portions of bacon and eggs. Maybe if you stick to lunch choices but I won't be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Authentic: this word is often used superfluously to attract attention. In this location, it is the battle cry. I dare you to try the tiramisu, mascarpone, cheesecake and tell me that it is not good: they are delightful. The ambiance is so relaxed, and the service matches the excellence of the food. I was with my wife, one evening, and the lights turned off. A nice lady comes over and says, this is more romantic, and puts a candle down on our table. How thoughtful is that? Please try the food, and support this local business."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant defiantly my new breakfast restaurant.
We have the omelette for 8.5
Come with salad cheese and bread
Check in and received free coffee"}
{"text":"Great place. 
Great food.
And really good espresso. 

I've been here when it was \"Natalie\" coffee shop, and it was not so good before. The place reopened 2 weeks ago - beginning of April 2014. It has been totally remodeled and under new ownership. The lady that owns the palce took the time to make it very nice. She gave it a new name \"The Strip View Cafe\" and it really has a view of the strip. 

The decor is now great - it has nice wood and glass tables, comfortable chairs, stone tile decoration, good working AC, fans and fancy lamps, nice bathroom, free wi fi, etc. 

The menu contains coffee choices, salads, sandwiches and soups at the moment and they are also offering breakfast.

Great start, I will be back again!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here because it happened to be right next door to an appointment and it was just wow! Incredibly clean, well lit, and the food was absolutely delicious and the price was unbelievably cheap! Everything is made in house and it's a difference you can taste! The staff are all bright and smiling, and it's overall the best cafe I've ever been to! Will be back another day for sure. 

 Also, what a cute spot for a date! The outside has large outdoor couches and bins of blankets for diners! So incredibly cute!"}
{"text":"Awesome little eclectic cafe. Great food from savory to sweet crepes. The panini were delish, hot house made soup. Service was perfection. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love them so so so much! On eat24 and on grubhub everything is still amazing and fresh! It's healthy and you can tell they pay attention to detail. They really care about their customers and what they serve them.  I love their european spin to everything. It reminds me of a close family feeling. A warm feeling along with good and healthy food, is hard to come by. This place certainly has that! Don't miss out :-)"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to spend nearly $20 on lunch,  but the price is my only negative. Atmosphere is cute and the selection and flavor is great. Our waiter had on pjs and I sort of dig that laid back feel, but not really when lunch is so pricey. My friend and I each went halfsies on our order, the fig & prosciutto sandwich and the three cheese one. Both were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Good outside seating area.  Tiramisu was dry, bland, lacked coffee flavor. Latte was bitter, grinds settling at bottom of glass. I wouldn't pay $10 for this again."}
{"text":"Love everything about this cafe, outdoor patio, crepes, coffee, homemade desserts.  Cozy vibe"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor.  Go to this restaurant.  I've been several times.
Here is what I've had on my 3 visits. 
Omlets made to order. Fresh ingredients.  Perfect every time. Comes with small salad.  Unique in its presentation as well as much healthier to eat then greasy artery clogging hash browns.
Today i had a bowl of beef and vegetable soup. Prepared with all fresh vegetables and very tasty beef. I also got a prosciutto panini with fresh fig.  There is no way to describe this creation without repeating the word yummy. 
Go there support this restaurant. Outdoor seating available as well as comfortable bseating inside.
Once seated you might have the pleasure of having Jezebel be your waitress. There's nothing better than getting service with a smile..  I'll definitely will return and I'll bring others with moi. 
Enjoy...."}
{"text":"Heard of this place by my business partner who heard about it through word of mouth as well. Went to try it out and I love the interior design, feels very comfortable and the outside patio is spacious. Loved their hospitality and the quality of their product. My Coffee was perfect and I can honestly say it was probably one of the best Caprese Panini I have ever had! 

This is definitely as good as it gets! Actually writing about it makes me want to go back right now. I highly recommend this place for your next cup of coffee, breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Really nice ambiance, not too noisy but also not dead silent. It's right off Rainbow Blvd so you have the gentle traffic sounds in the background, which I kind of like. The outdoor patio is really pretty and the chairs are comfortable, it's also dog friendly . I ate a caprese panini with lentil soup and everything was fresh and tasty. The woman at the front counter said all the soups were from scratch and You can definitely tell they use good ingredients. I also had a honey vanilla latte and it was excellent. Overall very happy with my experience and will be returning. The staff are also very nice, especially the woman at the front counter (she appears to be the manager or owner)."}
{"text":"This cafe is so cozy. My family and I just loved the ambiance and the food was AMAZING!!! Everything was homemade from the dressing to the buttermilk to the pesto to the panini's. I could go on and on. Jezebel is a fantastic hard worker and she provided excellent service. Met the owner Renalda and she was so warm and welcoming. I highly recommend this place. This is now our new favorite cafe."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing omelettes and coffee. One of my favourites is watermelon salad with feta cheese, onions, tomatoes, mint and dressing. It's a very refreshing meal for summer!"}
{"text":"Not sure where to start. 

Pros: cute decor, outside seating, strip view. 
Amazing, positive, young waitress. She held her own. 

Cons: only one waitress. Literally. All day, rush hour and all. This is not effective nor efficient. Long waits due to being overwhelmed with other demands. I don't like having to get up and ask for things or get them myself. The owner and cook were arguing in view of customers inside over our incorrect meal. Not cool. The panini was ok, bread was a little greasy or buttery I guess. We didn't get but a tiny tiny piece of avacado on our bacon, AVACADO, lettuce and tomato panini...which was a little pricy considering. 

 Not sure I will return...much better cafés elsewhere. I hope they make a little profit and get some help going on there...it's affecting their business."}
{"text":"it's a cute cafe, nice patio. crepe was tasty, but I didn't care for the pesto salad dressing. The service was good."}
{"text":"Really cute cafe with great food! I went around 4pm and it was empty. The whole atmosphere is really cozy and comfortable. I got a tomato basil soup with a side of garlic bread and it was delicious. Perfect consistency and it was so creamy. For dessert, I got a mascarpone torte. I didn't really know what was in it, but it was soooo good! Our server was really nice and the service was great. The strip view is nice but small, but the great food and service makes up for it. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a place to relax with friends and eat good food!"}
{"text":"I just often passed by this simple hangout cafe and i never thought how good their food was until i tried delivery one day! Now this place is one of those i ordered frequently. Their pastas are great, tomato basil soup is phenomenal, their paninis are healthy and fresh... i love the food in this cafe!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and love everything about this restaurant. The staff is friendly, decor is adorable, coffee and food is delicious. I ordered an omelette and it came with a delicious and fresh salad. Music is nice too. The muffins look good but did not try them....yet."}
{"text":"Much care was put into the décor and style inside this cafe: mason jar lights over the tables, unique artwork, chalkboard menu, fancy flooring, and a variety of seating options and textiles make this place remind me of Pottery Barn. This place has AMAZING food. Owners are Bulgarian and have tons of tasty and healthy European dishes and salads on the menu.

PROSCUITTO PARMA PANINI is huge and delicious, goes well with the COLD CUCUMBER SOUP. Go 'cuke crazy and get the CUCUMBER DILL SALAD too, a pretty presentation with tons of feta!  Everything is fresh and delicious.

Always check out the specials board. Their STUFFED CABAGE ROLLS are amazing, and also a gigantic portion, though heavier than most of their usual far. Desserts and coffee drinks are also good here- TIRAMISU in particular is a favorite.

Service is consistently good and friendly. They offer walk-up ordering for takeout orders as well as table service if you are dining in. Make sure to check out the art on the right-hand wall of the dining room: the framed piece featuring a bunch of cash has a sign on it in Russian that translates to, \"My territory, my rules!\"

TLDR: Gigantic, tasty paninis and salads, all with healthy Euro flair."}
{"text":"We really wanted to love this place. The customer service is wonderful, nicest people, but everything is over-seasoned and over salted. With the menu and the decor, they have the right idea but they just miss the mark. 
The fig and prosciutto panini was over salted and the \"figs\" were I believe, actually orange marmalade. They also added romaine lettuce to the panini which wilted with the heat and adds an off-putting flavor.  Menu states \"baby greens\" not romaine. 

BALT panini was also not edible. Poorest quality bacon available and most likely re-heated  for the sandwich. The sandwich had a watery vinaigrette that just made it worse.   

Nothing was fresh. 

Soups were also over seasoned. 

Side salad was good. I do like there homemade dressing."}
{"text":"there a few little hidden places you find in Vegas and this is one of them clean cozy and great food will be my stop always when I visit again"}
{"text":"Hm... I don't quite know where to start...

I was in the area for church, and I remembered that this place was nearby.. My friends wanted to go to a juice bar, but I was like hey let's go get some coffee and I've never tried this place. I was a bit excited because whenever I passed by this area, it seemed nice. The outdoor seating had couches and comfortable seats, which you never really see so that's always a plus. They do provide ashtrays for you smokers out there. 
The inside was a bit dark. Not to say that's bad, but just not what I expected. 

Now onto the real review...

I didn't get any food. Their menu was quite large. They actually do have one juice item on the menu if you really don't like coffee and you were kinda forced to come with your friends. They have a variety of food items..So..can you really call them a cafe? I guess so..
I got a shot of espresso because it's on the house if you do a yelp check-in. But I was going to get it anyway of course because the real way to judge a coffee shop is by their espresso beans. It wasn't too dark as far as espresso goes. So as a learning coffee critic, I can't totally judge it, but I did enjoy it. My palette is still growing ;) I also got a latte, which tasted fine. As any latte should. My friend ordered a cappuccino, but it pretty much came as a dry cappuccino (double the foam). 
Doesn't seem like a very experienced barista, but for the most part they get the job done. 

Overall this place is just okay. I was glad there was a non-Starbucks coffee shop in the area. I didn't complain too much or else I would've drove elsewhere. In the end, they got the job done. They did what they were required to do whether it was the bare minimum or not. I wanted coffee and that's what they served. I didn't hate it, but I wasn't WOW'd over it either.

{"text":"Strip View Cafe had some potential... but the indecisive concept killed it IMO.

Is it a lunch spot or a coffee place? They are trying to be both, and when I ate lunch here and switched to work mode after that, I felt uncomfortable. The presence of a server alone put me in an awkward position, but when she frequented to my table, sending a signal that I'm no longer welcomed, it was time to leave.

Even though I saw a couple of people seated in a booth and had their laptop open, it didn't feel like a place to get some work done.

It's not the greatest place to have lunch either for the very same reason, it's a bummer considering that their food was decent."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously delicious! I just had thier avodacado toast and I never knew something so simple could be so delicious. I had been here like a year ago but did not go back until today because they close so early but I'll definitely be back more often. I absolutely 100% recommend it. The inside of the cafe is nice and cozy with great ambiance and the outside is even better and beautiful. They even have blankets in case it gets a little chilli. 10/10"}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfeast or lunch (never been there for dinner). The Omlettes are great - prepared european style (must be the olive oil they use). Quiet and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is good coffee is good ! 
The restaurant is very cute !! I love to come here to do my work or
Just relax my day off
The reason why I take 1 star is customer service...
Customer service is most important since they get tip"}
{"text":"The more I go here the better I like it.  This was our first time ordering delivery.  We were leery because we have not had the best luck with delivery in this town.  They were fast,  the order was perfect and the food and drinks were fresh,  hot and delicious.  Loved it and the hubby was happy too.  It was his first experience with this place.  Two thumbs up  way up"}

{"text":"Came for breakfast but I should've checked the menu first as the selection was minimal unless I wanted a sandwich. 
Ended up just getting a chai tea, which I was expecting to be hot but was served cold, over ice, but it was pretty good nonetheless. 
The service was good but I left after the tea in pursuit of a heartier breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to order, I was suggested to do the soup and sandwich combo, at 110 degrees out I wasn't sure about the soup.  It's so worth getting the soup! Absolutely fabulous. Looking for something great and different? This is a must stop, quick lunch as well. 
You should try it on your lunch break."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  The kitchen is a little slow, but only because the dishes are made fresh. This is not a fast food place.  The table service is prompt and our server was friendly.  When the food arrived, it was definitely worth the wait.  I'll be sure to be back again soon."}
{"text":"This is a MUST EAT the weather is breaking and the patio is warm and inviting. This space is perfect for a working lunch, girl date or a romance. Gourmet food at a great price.

   Yum. The soup is so good. We got the \"teleshko vareno\" veggie and beef and it came with horse radish balsamic. Whaaaa? Yea super interesting. The coffee is delicious I get the decaf and my boyfriend iced mocha with came in a mason mug. And it was amazing. Smoothies juices and amazing pastry and desert. A hidden gem. Regular clientele shows how loved this cafe is. And you can feel the love.
 
The staff is all rad chicks w accents. I don't want to convince you anymore how wonderful this cafe is because Id like to keep it to myself a little. :p"}
{"text":"First off, for those of you wondering this place does have a view of the strip and it has outdoor seating. I personally like this, as Vegas hasn't seemed to figure out that nice outdoor areas are great for restaurants. 

As for the food. We've tried a few of the paninis and all were very good. Even with the delivery, they aren't soggy or inedible (I live within three miles of the restaurant). The ham and cheese, turkey and cheese, chicken pesto basil, and the sausage paninis are all good choices. I'm not a fan of the side salad that comes with the sandwich, as I prefer lots of veggies w my lettuce. But the soups are pretty good, and make up where the salad lacks. The favorite of my house is definitely the beef and veggie soup. Think pot roast with broth=this soup. This soup is worth the trip. The Greek salad is also a tasty choice (sans dressing- not a fan of their house dressing). I just added my own dressing at home, which is okay. If you place a minimum order with Eat24 they give freebies.  Go with the muffin, which is different every time and always good. It's great for next day snacking. 

Now the service:  I have dined in and had delivery. For my dine in experiences, this place has pretty mediocre table service. I have even seen people walk out after waiting 5-10 minutes without their order being taken. If you're in a hurry, it's better to walk up to the counter and ask someone back there. I think they could benefit from having one extra person on staff to help, and forgo the server making smoothie drinks behind the counter. It might be more than this, but in the few times I was there that was the biggest hold up. The poor dine in service is the reason for -1 star. 
As mentioned, I have also ordered via Eat24 for delivery. The delivery service is much better than the dine in (weird...I know). They are on time, the food is edible, and they read the notes. One time they forgot a sandwich in the order & handled it perfectly. The delivery driver immediately (without complaint) called the restaurant, had the kitchen make the sandwich asap, picked it up, and brought it to the house without delay. They also do a great job with packing the to go order, using cellophane to protect the soups and balsamic-horseradish sauce (which is great by the way) to prevent liquid spillage."}
{"text":"Great little bistro. They have a beautiful patio and they welcome dogs. They brought our dog a water bowl and some dog treats too. The menu is fantastic and PLENTY of good for the price. I'll add this to my favs!"}
{"text":"The tomato basil soup and chicken noodle were delicious. My 10 year old licked the bottom of soup bowl. The kids enjoyed their meatball sandwich.  The sausage panini was very good. Lovely tables outside. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place here on Yelp. Had never heard of it. What a great find!  Coffee is amazing. The food was great. And they mounded the bacon. Everyone knows the more bacon the better. Cute siting area outside. Great place for a lazy breakfast on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Good place to relax after the Spotlight on Vegas Business radio show! The stuffed cabbage was excellent (and I am NOT a cabbage person!) I think it was the Bulgarian twist! The homemade tiramisu was so #Yum!"}

{"text":"This place is delicious, clean, with great customer service and the food is amazing. I tried the chicken pesto panini with potato soup and my husband had the special for that day we loved it! definitely recommend this place if you want a nice brunch or dinner! Our waitress was very sweet and attentive even though we are outside she never hesitated to ask if we needed anything! I will definitely be a regular!"}

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place on a recommendation and I was really happy with the food!  More than just your standard soup and sandwich style place, this was one of those places that you can tell cares about the quality that they put in front of you.  Great for an easy lunch or ordering for delivery when its not the same old stuff (pizza, chinese, wings, etc.)  Give it a shot!

{"text":"Very impressed. The tomato soup was so good and the fig and prosciutto panini was amazing. Can't wait to go back and try more!!"}
{"text":"I seriously cannot rave about this place enough! The food is amazing and the new patio is beautiful and comfortable. The sound of traffic is a little loud but everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great food. The salad that comes with a panni is large and dressed in a pesto that is refreshening. The chicken panini is loaded with fresh tomato and a great crust. A great nite each time. The Italian sausage panini has marvelous flavors making you go in for another nite again and again. This is our second visit and we are already talking about when will we be here again."}
{"text":"Great place to have coffee, especially in The afternoon cuz the patio is one of the best in the area just to relax with your friends! Love coming here! Food is just excellent and the stuff is so nice and friendly! Best recommendation!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe. Decor is thoughtful and all about liberty. The owners are eastern European who really seem to appreciate the Unites States. 

Coffees are very good.  Served in shabby-chic mugs, not too bitter but not weak by any means. 

Soups: we tried the lentil and tomato soups. Both flavorful and well-above expectations. 

Wife ate prosciutto and fig panini. She didn't leave a crumb, not one. I ordered a veggie crepe and it was ok; a bit oily. The side salad was plain with oily dressing. 

The servers noticed that I didn't like my food, so they insisted on making me another dish. Service is a pure 5 stars, friendly but not overbearing. 

Second try was the Tracian Clay Pot (eggs, feta, tomato, olives and some provolone cheese). It came out quickly and tasted very good. It's not oily and it was nice to try an authentic Bulgarian recipe. 

The desserts look homemade and excellent, but we're full. No room. Next time for just coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"Love this place. If you're looking for a relaxing cafe with friendly staff and great light fare, this is it.  They have fresh fruit smoothies, espresso based drinks that are delish, and tasty food and desserts. The atmosphere is amazing, so relaxing with such a positive vibe. Definitely a must try when you want to unwind."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried at Strip View Cafe has been beyond my expectations and the most delicious thing I have ever tasted. They really put a lot of work into everything they do and make sure everything they make is absolutely flawless. This place is one of the best places out there and I have to have it at least twice a week. The woman who makes the deliveries is very sweet and overall I am just so impressed with this place its definitely a one of a kind gem! New favorite food place in Las Vegas!!!!"}

{"text":"The best cafe in Las Vegas, never been to a place that will take care of me as much as here, very friendly people will do whatever it takes to keep customers happy, and prices very cheap with night quality deserts and any type of coffees.
The outside sit down area is great to have a nice time with friends or family, romantic too if needed, with many blankets to keep you warm.
Highly recommended place...."}
{"text":"Only reason you got one star is cause the food was quickly delivered. The potato soup was really bad, tasted like it had been made with tap water or something. And the tuna melt was VERY mediocre. The crepe was probably the best thing we ordered and even that was skimped on the strawberries inside of it. I was really disappointed because I know people that love this place and the reviews are generally good, however our first experience was not a good one and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. I've had the crepes, grilled chicken sandwich and vanilla latte. Everything taste very good and great customer service.
They have nice decorations inside very cute and nice to relax by yourself or nice lunch/coffee time with your friends. 
They are close to my work, so I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love the food, but the outdoor atmosphere is horrible. 
Only reason I just cannot give this place 5 stars is because I love outdoor dining, just not at this place. The employees sit outside where people are eating and their smoke blows everywhere! It's disgusting. Smoking just should not be where people are eating. 
And it's not just the employees, it's also some customers.
Otherwise the service is good and the food is amazing! I love all their panini sandwiches and their soups! The tomato soup is amazing! 
The inside of the restaurant is cute. I just have never dined inside. 
I've been here about 5 times now in one month and I keep returning because the food is good and reasonably priced.
Always fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow.  This is one of those places I wish I'd discovered much sooner.  The food is incredible and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.   My wife and I had lunch here today and will be again, and often.   We both had the lunch special - a turkey sandwich on a croissant.  She had the beef and veggie soup, I had tomato basil.  Everything was fresh, flavorful and just damn good.   The tomato soup is honestly the best I have had EVER.  The wife raved about the sandwich and loved the beef & veggie soup.  The waitress brought out a balsamic & horseradish sauce to put in the beef soup, something I'd never heard of.  It was great - added a nice zing to an already great flavor.  

I'm not a coffee drinker but they menu had dozens of interesting sounding coffee drinks and the place smelled incredible.  I was tempted to try a smoothie but after lunch I was completely stuffed.  

This café sits right on the corner of DI and Rainbow and does indeed have a great view of the strip, especially at night.  

Strip View Café is worth the visit - I highly recommend.

Update 08/17/2015

Had lunch here again.  This time I asked the server for a recommendation.  She told me about a new dish called \"Thracian Clay Pot\" and said it was very good.   I ordered that dish and loved it.  It was sort of a stew with several different types of cheese and veggies.   Very delicious and certainly something I've never had before."}
{"text":"The Green salad smoothie taste so nasty. They know how to make smoothie . Don't waist your time . Every smoothie $6"}
{"text":"This cafe is very nice.  It's in a strange place, within a business park, but that works out because there is plenty of parking. 

The Patio, and Interior decor is awesome.  It's warm, and inviting.  They have a nice sound system that plays relaxing music.  Jazz I think? 

The staff is friendly, and constantly check on you to make sure you're all taken care of. 

My favorite items here are the Panini's, perfectly made by the cook in the back.  Not to crunchy, not to soft.  Everything fresh. 

Another cool thing I like is their register system. It's all electronic, and the waitress puts everything in on an Ipod Touch.  This way the order comes out right the first time. 

Free WIFI!! Plenty of seating, clean, friendly, great food, great place to come for a work lunch.  And to top it all off a nice view of the strip to the East."}
{"text":"This place has great food and excellent service. The atmosphere is very cozy everything comes out in a timely manner. The paninis are SO yummy!"}
{"text":"I've now had several Strip View meals over the last year or so. Some takeout and some at the cafe. The quality is uniformly excellent. Breakfast, soup, sandwiches. It always tastes homemade and I'm always glad I decided to go there. But tonight, my chicken pesto panini takeout had no crispy bacon--in fact, no bacon at all. No bacon!! Very disappointing. But it was still so good I didn't miss the bacon all that much (to my surprise)."}
{"text":"Kinda on the pricey side for paninis. But the food was very yummy, so no disappointment here  recommend the spinach and feta panini and the chicken pesto panini."}
{"text":"Great place and really nice inside and out to have a drink with some friends and enjoy the day. People that come have a great vibe as well and everything makes it easy to settle down and chill."}
{"text":"Had a great date at the Strip View Cafe. Their restaurant setting was perfect & offer delicious expresso coffee shots. I had their cold cucumber soup which I highly recommend and my date had a pesto panini. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We found this gem a year ago and travel the country for our jobs. Eating out is what we do. And when we come home we come here. The salad and homemade house dressing is the best I've had anywhere. The food is beautiful and more importantly delicious. This gem of a cafe is upscale food in a warm cute intimate atmosphere. Come here and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is the best little cafe in the neighborhood! Love that you can order online! The soups are amazing, always fresh ingredients, the salads are delicious my favorite is the chicken pesto love the healthy choices on the go! The blt and grilled cheese paninis are amazing!"}
{"text":"I just got takeout from this place and I couldn't eat any of it. I got the BALT which is bacon avocado lettuce tomato sandwich. It was not under hot sandwiches but was served hot which was gross. I asked for the bacon well done and it was barley cooked. I asked for no onions and it had onions. I got an iced coffee with it and it came to $18 which is pretty expensive. I wouldn't go back. I'm hungry and annoyed. Now I'll be hungry at work for the rest of the day. It's also pretty cluttered inside. I can see how if you want a coffee on the patio it may be a good spot to go. I'm pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Always a great eating experience here. I've brought family and friends and they all loved it !"}
{"text":"Food is good nice patio. The decor of the place is very nice with a European feel to it. The staff is very friendly and the place very clean. Wide choice of coffees and teas. A nice place to go on a nice day to eat outside
They have breakfast sandwiches creps is pretty good"}
{"text":"A locally owned place on Rainbow and Desert Inn, Strip View Cafe does offer a view of the Strip in the distance (if you squint really hard) and some good eats. The interior is beautifully decorated with a rustic, yet trendy, motif. The staff, particularly the owner, was very friendly while describing dishes on the menu, many of which are made from scratch. Sandwiches are large with prices to match. The chicken pesto panini ($10.95) was excellent with its house made pesto, plentiful white meat chicken topped with melted provolone, tomatoes, basil and EVOO. It came with a side of not-so-creamy potato soup. Even more expensive was the fig and prosciutto panini ($13.95). It was good for a few bites but the cloyingly sweet fig spread was too much half way into the sandwich. The lamb curry pie ($5), made in-house, had a pronounced gaminess to it that benefitted from a curry sauce that added some much needed depth. Saving the best for last, the mascarpone cake ($5) was a tantalizingly sweet dessert comprised of multiple layers alternating between creamy and rich mascarpone and chocolate.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"First time trying this spot the soups were so over salted!! Also my panini had way too much basil so over powering , not the mention the vinaigrette on my salad was mostly herbs I just wasted impressed, won't be back there. Service was nice though, and I liked the atmosphere and Music. Sadly I go places to eat though. :("}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have always been happy.  Small owner worked and local business.

I have been here multiple times and have loved every time.  Have been for gatherings and for personal taste fulfillment.  I have had the Caprese Panini, Grilled Cheese Panini, Chicken Pesto Panini, Proscuito Di Parma Panini, Spinach & feta Panini.  All have had great amounts of meat, cheese and seasoning, the option of the soup or salad I recommend the house soup any time of the year.  My favorite soups are Tomato Basil Soup, a warm reminder of my grandmothers, it really melts in my mouth I can dip almost any sandwich in it anytime of the year it is soooo good and in the summer I love the cold cucumber soup this one I don't dip but I love it!  Every sandwich gives me 2 meals with the soup it is so hardy and filling.

I love the decor in this restaurant it is inviting and warm modern and rustic kind of the perfect blend to have a meeting with a friend for a lunch or a quick after work snack work meeting also a great place for me and my girlfriends to meet for a snack pre drinks.  I live around the corner so I take out often but I have meet up with a girl friend to eat then wine after! :)

A fan for sure!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to come for breakfast/lunch. The last few times I have come, the server was not paying attention to the restaurant. I sat at a table for nearly 10 mins before being approached and asked what I would like to eat/drink, while the restaurant was not busy at all. I decided to try this place once more today. The exact same thing happened with the waitstaff again. I had to wave my menu in the air and say \"hellooooo\" before anyone even noticed I was there. I suppose the worst thing is that they have taken almost all the breakfast items off the menu, which is why I loved this restaurant in the first place. In my opinion, that was the best thing they made! The last 2 times I've been here, I walked out without eating or drinking and went to another restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Awesome food with authentic flavor! I enjoy the ham and cheese panini and the chicken pesto panini. Relaxed atmosphere with a nice view of the strip. The patio seating is comfortable and large."}
{"text":"Wow...just wow! I often give 5 star reviews, but you have GOT to try this place!!! The food, everything is from scratch, is some of the best I have had in town!! I had the B.A.L.T. Panini and it was fantastic. I didnt think it was dry like another reviewer did, but the only knock I would be able to give is the avocado was too green. My wife had the Senjanka salad and though it was rich she thought it was very good. 

Last thing...if you don't try their dessert I will punch you through your iPhone...in your face!"}
{"text":"I got the Smoked Ham and Cheddar Panini and Tomato Basil soup, it was excellent. Can't wait to order it again."}
{"text":"I have heard such great things about this restaurant and was so excited to finally get the opportunity to dine in. We walked up and their patio was shut down with tarps covering the furniture.  There were 3 tables awkwardly placed on the side walk that I assumed was their patio dining area. The weather was too nice to be inside and we had one of our pups with us so we dined there.
We were greeted by a friendly server that offered to serve food to our dog. She placed menus on the table and returned inside. The menu selection was a variety of paninis, soups, salads, and cold sandwiches.  I ordered the prosciutto and fig panini with the house salad and my boyfriend ordered the chicken pesto panini with a side of their potato soup. My panini was ok. I felt it was extremely salty and lacking fig! The salad was basically a spring mix with cucumbers and drizzled pesto as a dressing. The potato soup was probably the best tasting item we ordered.
As we were finishing our meal a few guests sat outside to dine as well. The minute they sat down they all lit up a cigarette and completely ruined the end of our meal. I eventually went inside to ask for our check and paid the bill so I wouldn't have to smell the smoke anymore.
I was extremely disappointed and won't be back. I love when restaurants offer outside dining but it's impossible to enjoy the nice clean air when your neighboring table is filling it with second hand smoke."}
{"text":"So good he nearly fell asleep after !! So delicious and such a nice comforting vibe. NEW FAVORITE CAFE. The lentil soup is the BEST lentil soup I have had and the BALT SANDWICH that put that man out paired with a delicious tomato basil soup were just amazing  I would recommend this cafe to anybody"}
{"text":"\"Strip View Café\", trust me, it's just a clever name. 

Clearing out old bookmarks on my phone I and happen to come across the Strip View Café. First off, \"strip view\" is a stretch. I mean you only see the top of the Strip skyline and that's if you're standing up. No view, no problem because the food here is pretty amazing. 

I ordered the Fig And Prosciutto Panini. This tasty amalgamation has prosciutto on Ciabatta bread with melted mozzarella, fig jam, and baby greens. Plus I added bacon. Because - bacon. I also ordered the Caprese Salad layered with tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil. Tossed in extra virgin olive oil.

Wow they killed on this sandwich! The prosciutto wasn't too fatty and sliced super thin for easy sandwich eating. The bread was soft, but crispy on the outside and the bacon and fig jam should just get married, because I love them together! A must try at The Strip Cafe. 

What about the Caprese Salad you say? It was fresh-a-licious. I'm not a huge tomato fan, but these were thick, fresh, and had that tomato sweetness that really put this appetizer dish over the top. 

The service was a little shaky and our food did take a little longer than I thought it should, but it did start to rain and people were shuffling inside. This could have confused the servers. Strip View Cafe, I will feast my eyes on you again soon!"}
{"text":"Loved coming here when I'm running around doing errands and is around the area. I live farther now So I don't come as often. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The interior is quaint and cute! Love the decors. Food is always great! Ordered their watermelon salad on a hot summer day and it was very refreshing! Will definitely come here again when I'm around the area."}
{"text":"I love this little spot! It's a very cute place with delicious food and drinks. I love going over there after I take my kids to school during the week and enjoy my \" me time\" their sandwiches are the best!"}
{"text":"They always have great food and service.  I have not had a bad experience yet. I've tried the lasagna, moussaka and today I'm getting stuffed cabbage rolls. Great spot to relax and music is nice!"}
{"text":"Hands down best place for lunch! The panini's and soups are delish! Highly recommend lentil soup with any of the paninis. Special desserts change weekly. I really wish they would sell their bread by the loaf."}
{"text":"Just left this place my first time here and had to write a review . It looked inauspicious from the outside - you will  probably drive right by it like I have dozens of times .
Glad I stopped ! Decor is creative welcoming and Kitschy .  Menu is varied and everything is fresh and delicious . Staff is friendly and attentive . Prices are good too . Will be back next week !"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. The soup is wonderful and a nice size portion. Had smoked turkey panini very tasty. Service was outstanding. Very warm and friendly atmosphere. Nice outdoor seating if not windy."}
{"text":"4 stars only because of the waitress, if she was not as horrible this place would have been a 5! 1st good things...
This place was great food! Price was not bad. Could be little cheaper but it's a small business and the food was worth it.
Crepes were amazing and all the soups were very tasty and not salty! 
All food came out hot and fresh. Even the manager came out to apologize for dropping a plate. 

NOW! For the Horror!
this waitress may have been not feeling well,  but being sick in a food place is disgusting! When your nose is running,  fix it before coming to my table. 
Next, do not ARGUE  that what I said is not what I meant! Her attitude towards me because I asked for lettuce not on my sandwich and then she assumed I didn't want salad, ok then still offer me soup like you did to everyone at my table. 
She was rude and irritating enough I almost walked out! Fix her or always stay a 4* if she was having a bad day then teach her to keep her attitude away from the people paying for her to keep her job."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the town. Atmosphere is calm, staff is amazing and the menu is really delicious. What better than amazing latte with view of the Strip ? 
More credits for the interior also :)"}
{"text":"Caprese salad, ice coffee, bagel with the fancy ham. Delicious. Everything was absolutely wonderful here. Great atmosphere and our server was very awesome as well. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came to vegas for the weekend and needed a hangover fix. Came here and got the chicken noodle soup which was pretty good and the BALT which was good as well. Price is good as well"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at how many positive reviews were for this place, perhaps it's because I ordered delivery and the food didn't travel well. But the meatball sandwich was coated in some weird cheese product and the avocado in the spinach salad looked so gross I couldn't bring myself to try it. Very disappointed with the entire meal especially after it costed me close to 35 with gratuity and delivery."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Food was fresh. Staff was nice. Nice place for a casual dining experience.  Soups are excellent and home made."}
{"text":"Amazing! We ordered the tuna melt, tomato basil soup, the snejanka salad (spelling?) and the caprese panini. ALL OF IT WAS TO DIE FOR! Amazing food, great atmosphere and the staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent serving, and very comfortable place for rest, the view is beautiful"}
{"text":"It's a very cozy place. The people are pleasant. The food is flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty decent little lunch spot. 

We ordered the tomato soup, fig and prosciutto panini and the chicken pesto panini, along with some chai tea lattes. Their service was great and despite being a little busy the girls were really attentive. The food was pretty good, we both really enjoyed the soup and the lattes the best. I like the music the play and the nice patio gives a great ambiance. They also do take out and delivery if you work nearby!"}
{"text":"Yummyyyyy. Been here a few times now and I have to say the food is amazing. The service is great. Super clean and pleasant to have any meal here. Highly recommended. Will definitely be recommending this place to all my loved ones..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a whim for lunch after seeing it from the street a few times. 

Atmosphere:
Kind of an odd location for a cafe. It's on the corner of a busy street, I have a feeling that's the reason for low customer traffic. The inside is quaint but a little dark so we sat outside on the patio since it was a nice day. It doesn't dissapoint on the strip view like the name but you do have to be sitting in the right area on the patio to see it clearly. 

Food:
The lunch menu had a lot of options for sandwiches, paninis, soups, and salads. My group ordered 3 paninis, 2 soups, and a salad. All were great, most outstanding was the cold cucumber soup. Portion sizes were just enough that we didn't need any boxes but also didn't leave hungry.

Service:
Soups and salads were served shortly after ordering, nice when you're hungry. Panini's came right around when we were finishing our first course. Server was nice but not very personable. We had to go get her when we were ready for our bill. 

Overall:
Food was awesome, definitely a good lunch spot. Would have given it 4.5, service was a little slow at the end."}
{"text":"Great service, good lattes and nice servers!  Don't much care for the 'choice' poster in bathroom. Wouldn't want to have a child with me in there."}
{"text":"Definitely 5 star!
Really nice place I love the decoration you fell so comfy, the kind of place to eat healthy, fresh and so delicious  the owner attended us it's so kind and social, I start with mango smoothie, caprese salad with chicken and a last a coffee all was of 5 star..."}
{"text":"What a great little spot! I'm so glad we stopped. The coffee was absolutely perfect (try the mocha coconut frap), the food came quick and was delicious! We both got the chicken pesto panini and it was ON POINT! The soups are made from scratch and you can taste the love in every spoonful! 

As an added bonus to the already wonderful service, they even brought us food and water for our service dog without hesitation! Awesome place! I recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"The coffee is great, I had a cappuccino. I also had the tomato soup it was \"no Bueno\" it tasted like warm ketchup. The tuna melt was pretty good! All and all it just was ok!"}
{"text":"Casually drove by this place whilst very hangry and was more than pleasantly surprised at just about every aspect of this place.

Inviting and creative decor and furniture with plenty of seating inside. Outside features a great patio area with ample seating as well.

We arrived during a down period, so service was fast and pleasant. Allowed us to take our time to check over the menu without rushing us which is always nice.

We got paninis, each were fantastic and delicious. My tomato soup was spot on, probably the best I've had in awhile.

Would highly recommend this place to anyone. Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Really cute cafe, that has the option of sitting outside.  I tried their Chicken Pesto Panini with the Tomato Basil Soup, and I must say it was very delicious.  I'd have to say that I enjoyed the soup more.  It was extremely tasty, you could tell it was made from scratch.
Our waitress was very nice, and attentive.  The vibe was very chill.  I thought the decor was cute!  Their lights are made of mason jars with a couple of random quotes hanging.
Overall, it was a really great place to get lunch.  I'd most definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Despite a long and slow day at work, I had an awesome family dinner at Viet Noodle Bar on Spring Mountain Rd. However after dinner some of us wanted some dessert and coffee. So my sister and I decided to open up our Yelp app and Strip View Cafe came up since we were in the vicinty. Then I noticed that I had this placed bookmarked for quite some time, just forgot about it. 

When we arrived, I was surprised with the setup of the shop which contain tons of quirky and cozy items that had an inviting atmosphere and cool pictures throughout the walls. The outdoor patio was pleasant and had a good amount of comfortable chairs. Awesome place to relax with a group of friends or family.

Upon placing our order, my sister and I decided to stay and enjoy the items we ordered. We had the privilege of being served by Jezebel. Who we initially taught was the owner because she was multi-tasking from the front counter, kitchen, lobby & outdoor patio. We were greeted upon sitting and told us that she will assist us. She approach us in a pleasant manner and ask us what kind of drinks we like. My sister got a Dirty Chai Latte and for myself, the Vanilla Honey Latte. We also got the mini Cheesecake.

Now onto the items that we got. From the first sip of my Vanilla Honey Latte...Oh Honey it was delicious!! The honey was paired well with the vanilla taste of the latte, consistent and balanced of sweetness and coffee taste. I was able to taste my sisters' Dirty Chai Latte, and that was good too! Our mini cheesecake was on point with texture and flavor, despite being biased with cheesecake. We didn't get a chance to try anything else because we had dinner prior to stopping by this place. I gotta come back and try out their lunch items too.

Overall we had a cool experience here and a great conversation with Jezebel and how Yelp lead us to this café at an undescriptive plaza on Rainbow Blvd. near the intersection of Desert Inn Rd. Throughout our conversation with Jezebel, another customer walk in and over heard us spoke about Yelp and came up to us and wanted to know more about Yelp. I got the chance to promote Yelp and explained to him how it works. His named is Edgar, so if your reading this review Edgar. I look forward to reading your future reviews my friend. 

Throughout the last 30 minutes prior to closing, the four of us had a great time reminising and acting like a group of high school friends catching up. This is gonna sound cheesy, but it kinda felt like a scene from Friends, whenever they gather at Central Perk.

*Jezebel, 
Thank You Again! Gracias! Grazie! Maraming Salamat!"}
{"text":"Great customer Service! Awesome food presentation. And it's also a very cute place! I'm not from around here and I enjoyed our visit here!"}
{"text":"I went to visit the Strip View Café with my cousin for a Sunday brunch.  Although the name suggests a \"strip view,\" it is a big stretch. I guess if you look closely past the trees, you can see the tops of the hotels. Anyway, the interior of the establishment is very cool-looking with mason jars being hung from the ceiling, stone with granite tops for the counter area, and glass table tops where local businesses have their business cards under for everyone to see. This place definitely gives off a calming vibe.

As for the food, I was highly pleased with it. All of their menu items sounded so good, I actually had a hard time choosing what I wanted to order. 
I ended up having the tuna melt and the vanilla cappuccino (use your check-in offer if you're craving extra caffeine). The tuna melt was a perfect blend of rich flavors from the albacore tuna and the cheesy provolone goodness. The bread it was served in was soft on the inside, and had a delectable crunch on the outside. 
They gave me the option of a salad or soup, and since it has been over 100 degrees lately, I opted for the salad. I've never really enjoyed a salad prepared by someone else until I had their pesto-dressed salad. Initially, I thought they were going to serve us a small little side-salad, but it turned out to be a whole plateful of it. It is still an excellent size for a semi-light brunch. The pesto dressing was drizzled on the salad, and not drenched in it. The veggies and greens in the salad were all fresh and flavorful (you can really tell by the color and the way it tastes). The tomatoes were succulent and sweet, and complimented the pesto and onions well. The vanilla cappuccino did not have an overpowering taste to it, and was made perfectly.

There is outdoor seating in the patio area, which looks just as clean as the inside. I would definitely recommend the Strip View Café for someone looking for a place to have a nice brunch/lunch. Free wi-fi is also available."}
{"text":"We dropped by this place for some lunch as the food on the menu looked incredible and they had so many different fillings of sandwiches/paninis etc, it was hard to choose! We went for an Italian sausage panini with side salad and both were delicious and the salad (as a side salad) was very generous with a lovely dressing. We also had a meatball marinara sandwich, which, although was tasty, was clearly made hours before and partially reheated as the 'melted cheese' was dried on. It still tasted good, but I disliked the idea of paying $10+ for a sandwich that wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"I hate bashing small mom and pop places but this place isn't good at all. Had the panini which was extremely dry had another dish and was dry as well. I also had the chicken pot pie which was salty and the worst part had a piece of hair in it. That really killed my appetite. Threw in the towel and asked for the check and left very disappointed!! Won't be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great place! I just discovered this beautiful cafe this morning. I had a very delicious latte and their deserts looked yummy! It's a nice place for hanging out with your friends or having a business meeting. Very good service and ambience."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Always get the ham & Swiss crepes. Honey Vanilla Latte is amazing. This place never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Vegas Great food and great service. Been here a few times an love the fact that my husband an I can walk to it as its close to the house. The tomato basil soup is my favorite along with all their salads. There panini sandwiches are also very good. Great for desert an cappuccino as well. So if your by there stop an try the food you won't be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Such a great little spot in Korea Town. Stopped in for lunch - the tomato soup was delicious, as is the house salad dressing. I also had the croissant, which was tasty. We ordered a party order of their lasagna and salad too, and it definitely did not disappoint! Highly recommended. The owner/chef was very nice and warm, and handled the order very professionally."}
{"text":"Rode our bicycles over have some coffee. Very friendly staff, great coffee, great food , highly recommended. Blows Starbucks away. The outside seating is very comfortable and very inviting."}
{"text":"I often visit Las Vegas for business and whenever I'm in town, I make sure to come to this restaurant.

I LOVE this place!  It's off of the beaten path and unassumingly delicious! When you step into the restaurant, you'll appreciate the quaintness of the decor.  It could be someone's home.  It's clean and comfortable. 

You have a choice of walking up to the register and just ordering a java and/or food item, but they also have table service as well.  

I love the menu.  It's just enough selection and everything that I've ever had has been fresh, great tasting & a great price too!  My faves include:  The Chicken Noodle Soup (i've honestly never had anything better than this), Watermelon salad w/avocado (dressing on the side), turkey/provolone panini.  Their coffee/lattes/cappuccinos are as equally wonderful as well! 

Not only is the food awesome, but the staff is always on top of it!  What more can you ask for?  Fantastic food, tentative service and a great value!  OH.. and they also redid their patio too, so dogs welcome!  Now, that just seals the deal!"}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for quite awhile and I decided to stop here after an appointment and have an early lunch.

I went inside first and while waiting to give my order, I heard some people say to the server that they'd be on the patio.  I asked her if I just go there and take a seat and she said yes. 

I went outside and I had my pick of several tables.  The good sized patio area was well covered by umbrellas so the sun was not a problem.  There is a small view of the Strip.  You can see the tops of the taller hotels over the detention basin across Rainbow Boulevard.

In a brief time, the server came out and took my order.  Since I had looked at the menu while waiting inside, I was ready to order.  I started out with lentil soup and followed this up with their chicken pesto panini.  I also got a caramel cappuccino. 

The soup was very good.  Hearty amounts of small chopped vegetables and lentils.  The panini was very good.  The menu describes it as: Grilled chicken with melted provolone, ripe tomatoes, crispy bacon and spinach--drizzled with pesto spread.  That's a good description.

Service was very good.  My server was also a very pleasant woman.  The only thing about which they have no control over is the noise from Rainbow Boulevard.  Being a major street and with a number of trucks, it was quite loud at times.  That won't dissuade me from returning when the weather is good for patio dining."}
{"text":"Lunch was delicious!! Cool cucumber soup on a 115 degree day in Vegas hit the spot.
Impeccable service"}
{"text":"Food isn't bad but ended up paying $30 for just two paninis. Granted it comes with soup but the soup (creamy potato) didn't go well with the prosciutto di Parma panini. Everything seemed over priced to me. Juice costs $6? No thanks.

Also, our young waitress mixed up our order which she apologized for. Poor thing looked so upset. The older woman who seemed to be the owner or manager would not stop yelling at her after this mistake. She got in her face and was extremely rude to the poor girl right in front of the customers. This is unprofessional and simply inappropriate. I felt sorry for the young lady. When the sandwiches did come out the woman who appeared to be the cook set them down and was about to take away my hardly eaten soup without saying a word. I was of course waiting for my sandwich to eat with the soup so I asked her to please leave the soup. She put it down and rudely threw her hand up as if to say \"well excuuuuse me\" haha. I couldn't believe it. The whole experience just kept getting worse.

With that inappropriate atmosphere and those ridiculous prices they'll go out of business just like the people who occupied that strange location before them. Never going back again.

P.S. If you're offering coffee and teas, why are they not open until 10 a.m. ? Makes no sense."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this restaurant for several months after seeing it on yelp as well as driving by. I finally convinced a friend to try it out with me who had never heard of it. We both fell in love with the ambiance, service, and Menu. 
We split the greek salad and chicken pesto panini. The  portion sizes are more than substantial and the food is delicious. Im looking forward tho many more visits and trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Supper cute cafe !! They have a lot of table to chill and enjoy the day with your family or friends or your self:) I had vanilla latte and crape. Crape was good coffee was just okay. But not bad tho ... ill be back again!"}
{"text":"Work had ordered us some takeout since we had to work through our break. Ordered the Chicken Pesto Panini with the mixed green salad. Was definitely a good sandwich. Had a nice crisp on the bread and decent flavor on the inside. I would probably go dine in even though it seems just a tad over priced for a sandwich and salad."}
{"text":"My first time going here I would have to say the food is pretty good. I got the chicken club with the creamy potato soup. 

The chicken club was very cheesy with tomatoes onions and lettuce. It's a bit messy but delicious. 

The creamy potato soup is not as creamy as I imagined. I was expecting it to be like a baked potato soup but that was my own fault for expecting it. 

For a drink I ordered a medium hazelnut frappacino and it is really good but my only problem is that the woman who made it put it in a larger cup and it made it look like I didn't get the right amount. I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt because I asked her if this was the correct size and she said she accidentally put my medium drink in a large cup... But this cup looks like a medium size? I'll post a photo... maybe it is actually a large cup but maybe someone who knows can respond.

Overall, I give it a 4 for my overall experience but if my drink size is wrong... That will be another story! Haha"}
{"text":"Drive by this place a million times and decided to finally stop.  Had the Chicken Pesto Panini.  Was delicious.  Restaurant quiet and clean! Plan on spending around $15.00 a person....."}
{"text":"Love this place and everything about it, the location, the food, very friendly staff, when I say friendly I mean it, I don't mean good customer service, but very genuine customer service."}
{"text":"Back at strip view cafe, never disappointed when I come here. Great food, nice portions, great price. The coffee is ridiculous as are the deserts. Its a shame my review was removed because I don't review much. I just don't usually like places enough to bother with it. This small cafe deserves it though."}
{"text":"Great place to come and chill. Food is making. I would say surprising. It comes out looking delicious and the taste doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Surprised by this off-Strip little gem. Nice decor, friendly staff and most importantly good food. Well prepared and well presented. One of very few places off the Strip that has achieved this level of quality. Even many big casinos that offer casual dining are not nearly as good as this place.

The only downside are the prices. For a small cafe that's way away from the Strip, and a very casual eatery they charge almost regular restaurant prices. Even a basic meal with a beverage plus tips will run over $30-35/person and much more if you're in the mood for a coffee and a dessert. Too bad, since I really like this place and would visit more often if their prices were a little lower.

Also worth noting - they're located on one of the busiest streets in Vegas. Outdoor seating is available and comfy, but the amount of traffic is not fun."}
{"text":"Well to start off I first should say that I've been a little sad today with Christmas right around the corner and most of my family back home in Michigan. I've always wanted to check this place out so I stopped on my way home and when I came in I walked into just a beautifully decorated little homey cafe and they were having maybe like a family or work family Christmas party, so sweet. The service was so friendly and efficient. I had a vanilla espresso and ordered my food to go. Excellent. So glad I came in! Feeling a little more relaxed  I'll be coming back here time and time again I'm sure."}
{"text":"First time coming here but I will be back! Fun place for client meeting, coffee date or alone to chill!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I am not a huge fan of the name but the food here is very good. Eastern European dishes mixed with some sandwiches cold and hot. They have specials every day. Coffee menu is good and tasty. I love the cold cucumber soup and stuffed cabbage rolls, these are both Eastern European classics and remind of me of my childhood. I love the sandwiches, very fresh and delicious made also with what seems to be a homemade mayo. Another hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"What a terrific lunch/coffee spot! Love the decor and the beautiful Serbian women who run the place! I get the tomato basil soup every time, it has a great unique taste and is best paired with the Chicken Pesto panini.  Fresh menu and atmosphere, five stars, one of my favorite places off the strip to stop in, have lunch, and surf the web with some coffee."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Great to stop in for lunch or to hang out outside in the evening. I've brought a few friends here and they keep coming back! The people who run it and the servers are extremely helpful and kind. 

My favorite things:

Cucumber feta salad 
Tomato mozzarella caprese salad
Cold Cucumber soup 
Chicken pesto panini 
Lentil soup!

All of their paninis are delicious tbh."}
{"text":"Always have a good experience here.  They were very pet friendly to our little dog on the patio, the food was delicious again, and the vibe is just really pleasant here.  One of
my spots for sure"}
{"text":"Located on the West side. If you like supporting local business, not just because they are local but because they are good, look no further fellow Yelpers. A great staff and a fun menu make it worth the trip. Plus there is a Yelp! Check in deal! (I wont tell you what it is, I will let you be surprised) They also do catering! Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend who works in this area and he was tired of all the usual suspects. So I choose this place based on reviews.  The café is fairly small with very cute décor. We were a bit confused by the set up and weren't sure if we were supposed to sit down to order or order at the counter. We were standing at the counter until they told us that they had wait staff. Our server was friendly enough, but was new and had trouble understanding what we were ordering so another lady, I'm assuming the manager or owner came over to help. No big deal. At the end of the meal, we waited quite a long time for our check and eventually had to flag her down and ask. 

The food was pretty good. I did have a taste of the tomato soup since it had a lot of good reviews. It was just ok for me - tasted too much like tomato sauce to me. Maybe not enough herbs or cream? I got the caprese salad, which was good, but had just a tad too much salt on top for my liking. My friend had the spinach salad with some added meat and really enjoyed it. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience. Would I go out of my way to go there? No, but if I were in the area, I would give it a shot. My friend who works in that area said he will definitely add it to his list of lunch spots."}
{"text":"I came for the first time to attend a birthday party. I met the owner who was so gracious and very personable. I had the Tuna Melt with a salad. The bread was simply fabulous (I wasn't planning on eating all of the bread but I couldn't stop until it was all gone. I loved the tuna and I am very picky about my tuna too! Everything is from scratch. The ambiance is great with outside seating that is very comfortable. Easy access, easy to find and parking is good. The service was very good. The prices were reasonable and the portions good sized.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend to pick up food to go for the 1st time. We spent some time looking at the menu and ordered 2 sandwiches each. 40 minutes later, I got only 1 sandwich. I told them I ordered 2, so she went back and put my 2nd sandwich in the bag. My friend's order came 10 minutes later and she only got 1 sandwich too. We were finally fed up and asked them where her 2nd sandwich was. They said they made it already but didn't know where it was. They told her to check \"your friend's bag\" and low and behold, 1 of her sandwiches was in MY bag. I asked them where my 2nd sandwich was and they told me it wasn't even on the ticket and that I didn't even pay for it. I was so hungry and tired of waiting I said forget it, I didn't even want to wait for the 2nd sandwich. They kept apologizing and saying they must've been busy, but there was no one else there but us. I believe the lady that walked in right before was the owner and she offered a free pastry and I couldn't even accept it. Despite waiting an hour for our to-go food, food quality is good."}
{"text":"first time here. food is amazing. perfect place to hangout. i would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I like trying new places and this seemed like a nice chilled place which it is but the prices are too much I ordered a smoothie which came in a mason jar type of cup for $6.00 and eggs which comes with bacon toast and salad for $9.00 my eggs were really salty I also ordered over easy and I got sunny side up! They need to google how to make eggs. But a plus for them is that the staff was really nice!"}
{"text":"What a great find!!! I was invited here by a friend and was so surprised that this place existed and served such phenomenal gourmet food. I had the kale salad with watermelon and walnuts. WOW! Finished off with honey vanilla latte that was sublime as well."}
{"text":"Unique cafe with a warm feeling and home made food. Must try the iced lattes but I can say, can't miss no matter what you get."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying how freakin cute this place is!! The decorations are so earthy and the vibes you get are so welcoming. 

This would be a great place to study since the music is at a perfect volume & they offer free wifi! They even have a comfortable outdoor covered patio area!

Came in on a quick lunch break, our server was very friendly & fast.

The food was AMAZING! I ordered the BALT (BEACON, AVOCADO,LETTUCE, TOMATOES) with a side of veggies and beef soup and it was yummy! The beacon was cooked to the perfect crisp and the meat was so soft.

I will defenitly be coming back for a few study sessions!"}
{"text":"How one single person can ruin your entire dinning experience!

As foodies my wife and I are always looking for the hidden gems here in town and after reading the reviews we were very excited to dine since we love cafes. Upon walking in my wife and son went to use the restroom when the server hustle her way past them shoving herself in the restroom first, leaving our five year old to do the potty dance while she took her sweet time. 

The menu looked fantastic and we debated over many of the delicious items on the menu. The server quickly took our order. The food arrived roughly 20 minutes after ordering. 

We ordered the three cheese panini with bacon. This item came out without the bacon on it. Due to the inexperience in the service industry, when we informed the server she looked as as if we had three heads and said, \"You didn't say bacon!\" She sent the sandwich back to the kitchen. Rather than heating a new sandwich so the cheese was properly melted. The chef simply slapped a couple of pieces of bacon on the panini and sent the sandwich out cold with unmelted cheese. Thus, no longer being considered a penni. 

The watermelon salad was indeed not a watermelon salad but rather a tomato salad with some chunks of watermelon in it (80/20 ratio at best). The salad would have been amazing and to be fair the server did take off the bill but server never stopped by the table to ask how our meal was until we had completely finished and she came to clear. 

The flavor profiles of the dishes tasted good; however, the execution was poor. If the restaurant took a little bit more pride and hired experienced servers who cared than this could've been a five star review!"}
{"text":"Renata the owner was my delivery person. She was kind enough to wait patiently at the gate since I don't have a gate code to my apt complex.   I ordered the chicken pesto panini with the potato soup which my son couldn't get enough of! He is a picky eater so I'm glad he enjoyed it. The portion was a perfect size! I was able to save the other half of the panini for later. The estimated time was 1 hour but was here 45 minutes later. The cook who made my food put a lot of love in making it seeing as how perfect everything was. I will be a regular from now on. I recommend this place for the passion behind this small business owner and her staff!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place.  The patio is nice, and the inside is very eclectic.  The food is very good.  I love my strawberry spinach salad.   Jezebel is darling, very helpful and very friendly.  I thought all of the service was good also. Yes, I will be back."}
{"text":"Enjoying my favorite spot again with my besties. Potato soup is the bomb! 

Everything that I've tried so far is delish. My favorite is still the creamy potato soup thought. 

Patio is gorgeous and they always take care of my dog. Spoiling him with doggy treats and I simply love it."}
{"text":"So happy they opened this place right next door to my office. I've been there basically every day and never disappointed on their food.  Why would I be? The soups are to die for and their BLT Wow, super delish!!! I'm little by little trying a different item and so far the ones I've tried are excellent. Please make space for the eclair torte, you will not be disappointed!!!! Lovely owner, fresh and tasty food, nice ambiance, you can't go wrong!!! =0)"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly fresh and amazing service ! You feel right at home with quiet peaceful ambiance. Great hidden gem in Las Vegas with top notch quality! I come her at least once a month and I'm always really happy with everything I have tried . honey vanilla late is a must!"}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break since I drive by quite frequently and have been wanting to check it out. It's in a little office park along Rainbow, which is an unusual place for a cafe, but I imagine they do good business with the employees there. I was looking for a place with outside tables to relax and read while eating lunch, and it was a pleasant surprise how good the food was.

There is definitely some Eastern European influences in the menu, and many around me were speaking Russian. I ordered the Caprese Panini which came with a salad that had really good homemade dressing. Both were pretty good. The service was prompt and friendly. Zero complaints at all. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Savory soups and the bread is to die for!
I had the delicious lentil cup of soup which wasblike a bowl with garlic bread.  Hubby had the potato soup and tuna melt.
We will be here again!"}
{"text":"This review is purely about the quality of food not the service. The first time I order prosciutto from there was two months ago and it was amazing. Since then I feel like I ordered proscitto and they got it from the grocery store. If you want thick dense chewy pancakes then order the crapes. I have absolutely no idea how they think what they serve are crapes. Other items are terrible but I'm not going to waste anymore of my time with this review"}
{"text":"I love that I have found several great places in Las Vegas to eat that are not chain restaurants. Strip Cafe is another one. My salad was probably the best I have have here in Las Vegas since I have been in town. Cucumbers were fresh and flavorful. Great food great owner and staff. If you have a business meeting or just a casual day this is a great spot for a bite to eat! Oh yes and a view of the strip of course  absolutely a 5 star cafe"}
{"text":"I am so glad I gave this place another chance. The restaurant contacted me after my previous review very apologetic that I'd had a bad experience, and wanted to make it right. They are all so nice, they genuinely want you to feel welcome and happy at their restaurant.

This time I ate in with my husband for a late Saturday lunch; and I will definitely be back. The restaurant and especially the patio are wonderfully casual. The kind of place I could see coming back to often for coffee and a treat when I want to enjoy the beautiful months of Vegas weather. 

The coffee is great; perfect foam, unburnt shots. I worked in a coffeeshop for most of college, so I get sad when coffee is bad; this coffee was pretty much perfect.

I had the Snejanka; holy cow, you could see and taste the love that went into this dish. I had never had anything even close to this salad before, so it was a really fresh, exciting meal. It was also crazy rich and quite filling. I want to try the other bulgarian specialties there, and the watermelon salad! And the soups! The cold cucumber sounds so perfect for a hot vegas day. They do really great plays on tangy and creamy and crunchy. And the deserts. I'm not eating sugar right now, but oh man I want to try those deserts. 

My husband had iced tea (I am specifically abjured to remark that the tea was way better than expected for \"just iced tea\".) and the strawberry avocado salad with bacon. The house vinaigrette was tangy and wonderful, and the avocado and strawberries perfectly ripe. He is usually grumpy and gets unripe hard avocados when we eat out, these were at their perfect peak. He got a few bits of spinach that might have been just about to go off, but overall, both of our meals were fabulous.

I will definitely be back, probably fairly often. I've been looking for a cozy place with a patio where I can bring my sketchbook and snack on a saturday afternoon when I can't get work done at home, and a great place to take my mom for a relaxed lunch when she visits from Minnesota. She always wants someplace to eat outside, and there are so few great local places I can take her. She'd love this place. Thanks for inviting me back, Strip View! I'm SO glad I took you up on it! 
 
I'm seriously thinking my Eat24 driver couldn't stand the delicious smells, and ate our sandwiches last time, then replaced them with Albertson's versions to get away with his nefarious crime."}
{"text":"Staff was nice and helpful explaining the menu. Food was great. It hit the spot. I had the ham and cheddar panini and chicken noodle soup. Little pricey but worth it. I will be back. I'm excited to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I just had a coffee here while I studied (which was good) but the five stars are mostly for how good the music was here. Very well selected. Good tunes from the 80s that was a blast."}
{"text":"I work in food and beverage and I broke the law by placing a to go order at strip view Café about 20 minutes before they closed. I was really excited about the pesto and chicken Panini which had received many many great reviews. however when I received it I was very disappointed because they had forgotten to put bacon and cheese on it so I got some small pieces of chicken pesto a lot of spinach and a slice of tomato that was in the Panini. The Panini was cold but I had it delivered and their store is about a 10 minute drive from my house so that was probably my fault. I was very disappointed with the two desserts my friends and I picked. I love flan and I got the caramel flan style dessert it had no flavor, except for the burnt bottom and the fruity mini cheesecake was simply a small round piece of cheesecake with whipped cream and I believe some white chocolate drizzled on top so we didn't know why they had called it a fruity cheesecake she expected to have some fruits or something either on it or in it. The Caprese salad looked amazing in the photos online and it was to me just a basic standard caprses salad the one great thing though was they had an offer where the first time you order from them they give you a free house green salad and I'm a salad person! I love salad I don't know how much just a regular salad costs but the free salad they sent me yesterday is what I'm having today for lunch and dinner it's very large and their house dressing which appears to be kind like a chimichurri vinaigrette, was amazing! I don't see myself ordering from them in the future. The total cost was $60 for the order and it just wasn't worth it. Once again I work in food and beverage, I  did place a to go order 20 minutes before close, but they forgot bacon and cheese on a simple panini, and I ordered all of their most popular items."}
{"text":"Just stopped in here for a late lunch but was very disappointed by the terrible service. After sitting outside for close to 10 minutes I finally just left. There were other customers there as well, but after having the waitress walk by with no acknowledgement, I figured I'd find a restaurant that valued my business."}
{"text":"Love this place. Homemade food is great !!
Nice music and friendly staff!!
Cozy atmosphere"}
{"text":"The honey vanilla latte was delicious and decent proportion wise. The chicken pesto panini was crispy and the chicken had great flavor. I will be definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I identified this spot as a restaurant I'd like to try nearly three months ago. This is the perfect Saturday solo adventure for my mood, but I guarantee it'd also be great for some quality time with someone else. I ordered a fresh squeezed juice, the special cabbage rolls (per the suggestion of the server at the register) and selected a spot outside under the misters. The small order of juice is massive and the food is like nothing else I've eaten in Vegas. It tastes very homemade and I will say, it's hitting the spot. I'm trying not to slam all my food before I kick my feet up a bit and read some pages from my book. I'm so thrilled to finally try this place as it's exactly my kinda spot: delicious food + lovely environment."}
{"text":"Sauces, dressings, desserts... everything is homemade and delicious!  Paninis are awesome and come with either a bowl of soup or a huge plate of salad.  Portions are large and prices are reasonable.  If it matters to you, the presentation of the food was beautiful.  The service was amazing and the owner is super duper friendly.  Will definitely be coming back!

The owner also explained to us that she is remodeling the outside patio area which will be ready in a month or so. Can't wait to see the new addition."}
{"text":"Lentil soup, chicken pesto panini with green salad on a side, tiramisu all is so delicious. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"And they took my order over the phone it was very unprofessional, they put me on hold many times, I was really annoyed. When I went to pay with card they went to put me on hold again so I told him that I would pay in cash. They told me it be 40 minutes but actually took a little over an hour. The delivery man did not apologize and did not even have change to break my hundred dollar bill. The only change he had was enough for me to give him a $10 tip and I didn't want to give them a $10 tip. I would have been okay with that if my Order was taken more professionally and quickly and if my food came on time and even if he was apologetic. I can say that the soup is yummy tho. Last time I order delivery from this place but I'm in the neighborhood I would eat there in person.

I had three stars before but added another. They gave me a free cheesecake and it was yummy"}
{"text":"We order lunch for our staff from Strip View Cafe. Their sandwiches are delicious and they deliver on time, every time!  Will use them again!"}
{"text":"The food was fabulous. I tried the beef and vegetable soup and my husband tried the tomato basil. Both soups were delicious and homemade. We also had turkey croissants and enjoyed them as well. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"A fabulous place to pick up a quick breakfast. It's super popular and great for just chilling for awhile."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place and it feels like forever since I've been here. Their Greek Salad is off the charts.  And the music is great, too!  I would call it international jazz.  As you can see I get my salads chopped...."}
{"text":"Lovely spot for friends and business. The menu is diverse with an interesting spin on classics with a Bulgarian twist.  I had the cucumber dill salad. So refreshing with the most delicious homemade vinaigrette and lots of fresh dill.  The cabbage rolls were so tender and flavorful.  Comfort food that doesn't weight you down.  Service was so friendly and attentive.  Patio seating is charming and it does deliver on those Vegas Strip views.  Free wifi makes it my new Westside business meeting spot as a great,  locally-owned alternative to chain coffee houses."}
{"text":"Absolutely great and homey place! Food is delish and atmosphere over all is pleasant! I had crêpes with smoked ham, Swisse cheese and avocado and it comes with salad and my favorite salmoriglio sauce! Fresh squeezed juices are what I am looking for every place I go! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I got the caramel cappuccino and the tomato basil soup. Both are so good and they make it really quickly. The staff is really nice and they're really smiley. Beautiful set up and a good place for me to study during the day."}
{"text":"I have been in numerous times and I love the feeling in there. The service is top-notch and the food has been consistently delicious. My personal favorite is the Chai with the breakfast special. The bacon is always crunchy, just the way I like it and the eggs were seasoned perfectly. The pleasant surprise is getting a delightful salad on the side that is drizzled with a freshly-made herb vinaigrette. Whether I pop in for breakfast or just a cup of tea and to do some work on my tablet, I'm never disappointed. The server noticed I was working and let me know they had free wifi too. Impressive, to say the least. It's far more cozy and quieter than Starbucks and the prices and value are better too."}
{"text":"I was working and needed a place to stop with my rep for a quick healthy-ish bite.  This place was a hit with both of us.  She's a local, and I was just visiting.  Both vowed to come back.  This was a great little oasis to break up the day.  Memorable salads and tasty paninis.  Bonus was the loungy outdoor couches.  Little cooler, and we would have ate outside in the comfiness."}
{"text":"The service and greeting were prompt and friendly. I had lunch here and found the food to be fantastic. We tried several items including a salad and soup."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Good presentation. I liked the ambience a lot. Price is very reasonable. I have been there unexpectedly and will go back if i visit vegas again"}
{"text":"Service was ok. The lady seemed unsure of what she was doing and had gotten our order wrong. 

I had ordered an omelette and creamy potato soup yet somehow I ended up with the tomato basil soup and a panini. Another lady did come by though to fix the mixup of my omelette and panini, though not the soup. 

My boyfriend had gotten the meatball sub. When it got to the table, even I could see that it had been sitting a while, because of how soggy the bread had gotten. Plus, it was pretty cold."}
{"text":"The last few months, I've been leading a book club, and we've been meeting at different spots around town.

For this month, we decided to meet at Strip View Cafe.  I've driven past this place a million times, and have had it bookmarked for ages, I just never seem to remember it until we're headed someplace else and pass it. 

On Saturday afternoon, around 1pm, we came in, and the place was pretty empty.  
I ordered the honey vanilla latte right away, and told the server I was going to wait for the rest of the party.

The honey vanilla latte was $4, and the small was the size of a medium at Starbucks...and it tasted amazing.  I'd come back for this alone!  Excellent start to the visit.  

When we ordered, I went with the prosciutto di parma panini, and asked the server's opinion on a soup.  She recommended the lentil, so I went with that. 

I LOVE me a good lentil soup, and this was divine.  The lentils were the perfect texture: not mushy, but not hard and crunchy.  The broth was flavorful, and there were chunks of onion floating around...really great! 

The panini was huge.  In fact, I asked for a box right away and put half away (so I wouldn't overeat, and so my fiance could try it.)...I almost took it back out again and ate it on my own. 
Packed with tasty, salty prosciutto, basil, Parmesan cheese on perfectly toasted bread, this sandwich was heaven.  I even ate the tomato, and I'm not usually a fan of tomatoes.  

Service was extremely polite.  A little slow at one point, but that was because we told them we were waiting for someone who wasn't able to make it.  It took a moment to catch their attention, because they were helping others, but it really didn't take away from the experience at all.  

The place is clean, and I love the set up. 

Now that I've been here, I have every intention of coming back again.  

Great job, Strip View Cafe!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to stop by here for awhile and finally did. We walked in and was greeted right away and directed to sit wherever we wanted. In looking around the deco is a little confusing and too much. The pictures don't all tie into each other and the glass table tops have business's cards and misc stuff crammed underneath. The waitress brought us menus right away and got our drink orders.  The prices are a little high but after tasting the food I can tell they use fresh ingredients which I am more than ok paying for. Two of the sandwiches did not come out and we had to ask for them. The waitress went back to the kitchen and we could hear her speaking to the cook which should have been kept a little more hushed and private. When she brought them out they were cold. They did comp the sandwiches without us asking and offered free desert so they did what they were suppose to do to make up for the mistake. This would have been five stars if the food had not been cold. I had a veggie omelet and it was honesty the best omelet I have ever had. I didn't understand it being served with a salad though. After we ate I visited the bathroom and again confusing decorations. The man that was in before me I think worked there because after coming out he stood leaned up against the end of the counter going into the kitchen. IF he did work there he left the toilet seat up and it was gross underneath. All in all the place was good and I might go back because of the food and they did comp for the mistake."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try something new and we found this little hole in the wall. What a warm atmosphere, wonderful service, and great food. We loved it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing new cafe with excellent service and exceptional food. The menu has something for everyone.  Perfect location at Rainbow and Desert Inn. Ask for Iris and Erica.  They'll take great care of you."}
{"text":"Amazing paninis (tried both the caprese and the BART) and they give you a choice of soup or salad side. We chose the tomato soup and it was delish! I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try something new and this place was amazing. The soups are all homemade. I ordered the beef n' veggies soup with an Italian sausage melt. My husband ordered the chicken noodle soup with a chicken pesto. Everything was perfect, great service and an amazing honey vanilla latte :) I am a huge Starbucks lover but this place is at that level. Very chill environment and the vintage look was very pretty. Will come again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Strip View is one of the favorite places I take my wife. It's like a real life Pinterest, great decor. The staff has great character and the food is super good! It is hard to find the home cooking feel but this place does it."}
{"text":"EAT HERE. I was just hungry after my doctor's appointment in the same shopping center, I didn't know that I was about to have the best panini of my life. I got the Grilled Cheese (with tomatoes and red onions) and my mouth has never been so happy.
Also- this cafe is on rainbow and spring mountain, so I don't know what past reviewers were thinking they would see, but you can definitely see a nice view of the strip from the patio. I was here in the day time, so I imagine it would look even nicer at night!
Anyway, the interior decor is wonderful, the food was incredible and I got it fast. It was less than 10 bucks and hit the spot. Will definitely be coming back here :)"}
{"text":"I've been driving by for months and finally decided to stop in. I had a BALT with the house salad. I've not had a more fresh salad in Vegas. And the BALT (Bacon Avocado Lettuce Tomato) was cooked perfectly. Definitely going to be a regular spot for me and my friends now."}
{"text":"Second time in. Have driven last this place for a long time. Regret I never came in. Eclectic vibe with great good especially soups. Cozy so plan on staying awhile . When it warms up will definitely be trying the patio."}
{"text":"Regarding Delivery Service: 
First order: (month ago) took over 1.5 hours to get my order when I live less that 5 miles away. Driver does not know how to use or have any GPS device.

Second order (4/26/15)
Waited about 1 hour. Got only half of my order and only realized when driver had left. Called lady at store and she apologized and seemed agitated as well like she just wanted to pay me off and get me off the phone. Said 
She's gonna call driver real quick to turn around and refund me. Driver comes back and gives me cash for just the missing items. I still payed delivery fee for an incomplete order. And I tipped well in regards to total order cost. There was not enough food to feed everyone the order was for. Leaving us having to order elsewhere. The driver apologized and said everyone was in a rush to leave as I ordered near closing time. How is that my fault? I think she should have refunded the whole order. 

After the driver gave me a partial refund and left. I was unable to get ahold of anyone at the restaurant.

Waste of our time and money. Food was cold and ok. Not ordering or going there again."}
{"text":"Quaint little cafe with great food!  I had the chicken pesto panini which was excellent, the tomato soup which was a very good and a mango smoothie, which i enjoyed.  I would come back  here again."}
{"text":"I work across the street and I thought I would check this place out and I'm so glad I did!! It is amazing.  I love everything about this place. The food is amazing and the environment is homey and the service is phenomenal too! Best place in vegas hands down."}
{"text":"We liked the outside patio. I had the Greek Salad. It was so good I got one to go for a friend. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Actually writing this review as we sit here and it hasn't been the best service. Not many people here, so not busy at all and yet we haven't been checked up on to see if everything was okay or not even a refill of water. My friend had to get her water out of her purse. Food was bland and just terrible service period."}
{"text":"It was my 1st visit here and I will back!  Décor is great it has a relaxing vibe.  The coffee was good.  I had the Thracian Clay Pot for breakfast and it was amazing you must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Great service, artsy decor, delicious food and a good view of the strip."}
{"text":"The latte isn't very good, the music is too loud, and it feels like a weird mix of a diner and a coffeeshop. Also the decor is rather overtly political in a way that could offend some. Maybe the food is better than the coffee beverages. But I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Great food every time. We live nearby and enjoy eating in and ordering take out from Strip View Cafe regularly. I am addicted to the meatball sub, but if I'm feeling like something light their salad is delicious and made with homemade pesto dressing that is awesome. Every soup is made from scratch and so tasty. We've tried dozens of menu items and they are always consistently delicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant and I would definitely eat here again! My co-workers and I had a tuna melt (which was huge), strawberry fields salad, and a chicken Caesar salad. No complaints from anyone. The ingredients were fresh and they didn't take very long to deliver. I can't wait to try more items from the menu especially the smoothies!"}
{"text":"Nice patio area for dining. The option to have my pup and the fact that they bring a bowl of water and food.. A+! Human food was good also.. we came about 20 minutes after opening and I'm not too sure they were ready for us. They came and cleaned our table and took our order relatively quick. Staff was friendly and I imagine it was the owner that brought our bill.. she was awesome! Very friendly and loved our pup :) 4 stars for luke warm soup and forgetting my lemons :/"}
{"text":"I love the interior decor.  I ordered a panini to go.  Upon inspection of the panini, I discovered an issue so I contacted them.  The woman in charge apologized and offered to have her cook remake it and have her driver deliver it to my work (I don't think I am in their designated delivery zone).  Not too long after, a new panini was delivered and a piece of tiramisu was also in the bag...nice touch!  The panini was mostly good except the bacon was not crisp and the fatty part was hard to chew...personally, I prefer bacon to be crispy!  All said, I will attempt another visit in the future as I think it has potential.  At least the woman in charge cared about me enough as a customer to correct the issue."}
{"text":"Had this place for lunch yesterday, the soups are all homemade and the sandwiches pair for the most perfect lunch! The portions are large, and they have a huge selection. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"asked my gps to 'find coffee near me' so glad this place popped up. everything under the sun and a cozy inviting atmosphere. i live for independently owned establishnents. friendly staff, extensive menu & great atmosphere 10/10"}
{"text":"The outdoor seating is cute. The thing that I dislike and is why I am giving such low review is that all my food and beverage had fiber hairs all over. I told the waitress and she re did my food. Same thing, fiber hairs all over. I wont return. I am disgusted by any hair on food."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday around 10:15am for breakfast, no other customers (should have taken that as a sign).

Pros:
1.  Large patio that is dog friendly!   :)
2.  Very extensive lunch menu.
3.  Very good omelets (about the only thing they had for breakfast)

Cons:
1.  VERY limited breakfast menu.
2.  For the only two customers in the place, service could have been a little bit better.
3.  I know it's probably a very European thing to have salad with every meal (even breakfast), but I'm not a salad person at all.  The option to have fruit (fresh or frozen) would have been appreciated and not that much effort. 
4.  I'm lactose intolerant and heavily suspect there was dairy in the omelet  ... feeling the pain the next day.

If Yelp had a half-star, I would probably give this place a 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"A neighborhood, hand-crafted, independent cafe. High quality, healthy menu. Fiercely motivated and fiercely motivational! Moderate price.

This is a great place for breakfast or lunch or late night (advertising 6am-midnight hours). Great for kids, with a ton of healthy, kid-friendly selections like fresh squeezed Orange Juice. Tip; you can watch them squeeze the juice right in front of you if you sit at the bar.  Outdoor seating means dog-friendly.

A wide selection of lunch-y, snack-y stuff like soup and sandwich/soup and salad combos make this a great place to meet and greet. Situated on the border of Spring Valley neighborhood and Westside neighborhood at the corner of Desert Inn and Rainbow on the NORTHWEST side of the intersection, this venue is minutes from the strip. Driving from Las Vegas Boulevard, take Sahara west (up) to Rainbow,  turn left (south) on Rainbow. The cafe is on your right with private, off-street parking.

The coffee drinks are just too numerous to describe in one review, but everything you can imagine is on the menu."}
{"text":"I have drive by this place so many times, so my husband and I decided to give it a try. We eat here on a weekly basis almost. This morning I had a ham, mushroom, and cheese omelet which was AMAZING!!! The coffee is better than Starbuck's and I love Starbucks. The atmosphere is very cozy. The staff is wonderful. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Thought it was okay. When i went it wasn't hot outside yet so we sat outside. We ordered specialty coffees but they weren't very good. And the food came out late when it wasn't busy. She didn't tend to us very much. I say it was an okay place to eat."}
{"text":"Honestly I have been wanting to come here for quite some time. Finally my wife and I decided to give it a shot. As soon as I stepped in and I was surprised to see the restaurant was very  vintage looking. We fell in love with it right away. The service was just a plus. She offered items that we didn't know that could be added to what we ordered. I ordered the chicken pesto panini with a chicken noodle soup! Amazing!!! My wife ordered the Italian sausage melt with a beef and veggie soup and it was just as good. I can't wait till I come again!!!"}
{"text":"Ok.  I hate giving this review.  In fact, I've debated back and forth for days about posting it.  I love yelp though and it's my main tool for finding new places to try out, so I have to keep it real.

This location is super close to work so I was excited when the business opened about 3 weeks ago.  I tried it this week for lunch with mixed feedback.  I will give the cafe a second chance, because the food was decent.  The dining experience is what throw the overall experience off.  We sat outside on a nice patio, but if you aren't a smoker beware...it's gross eating next to a table, or 3 full of smokers.  

Let me say that the young waitress was FANTASTIC!  She was super nice and energetic!  The problem was is she was the only wait person for the whole place during service.  I could not believe it.  I'm not sure how any business person could support not hiring more wait staff.  The poor waitress was running around too much.  She made errors, not because she was not dedicated, but because she was overwhelmed.  I give her credit though...she was so positive and smiled the whole time.

So back to the food.  We had the BALT panini with potato soup and a turkey panini.  I had the peach smoothie as well.  I had asked for white bread instead of the ciabatta bread, which came out wrong from the kitchen.  We had to go back inside about the bread and got to witness the owner being short with the cook about the mistake.  She actually asked us if we told the waitress we wanted a different bread...ah yeah we did and she even read it back to us on her iPhone.

The smoothie was very thick and sorta bland.  I wouldn't recommend it.  The potato soup had a very herby taste to it.  It was good, but not what I expected.  It was more brothy, than creamy.  The BALT had 2 small pieces of bacon and a sliver of avocado.  I felt like for the price it should have been more.

The food was decent, not exceptional.  I would return because of its convenient location.  I hope as they get busier, the owner sees the value in additional wait staff.  I would worry about losing the one that's there.  And know...I don't know her, just felt bad for how hard she was working, but not able to keep up with the service needs."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and ambiance.  Everything was super fresh and flavorful. The soups are to die for with Eastern European flavors Spoke to the owner Renata, very sweet and accommodating and passionate about her new cafe.  Big plus, outside dog friendly patio!  

Highly recommended!
Todd and Sandra"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Prices are better than Starbucks and way more high end. You feel that you are at European place.."}
{"text":"Beautiful location with a nice outside patio setup. Amazing service with delicious food!"}
{"text":"I just pick up my order.  I had the potatoes soup and BLT.  The soup taste like water and it was orange.  The sandwich was so soggy and I ask for crispy bacon and got the opposite.  So nasty, I just threw it in the trash. On top of that, my stomach started to hurt."}
{"text":"Had lunch here 6 times, taken different colleagues each time, everyone is a fan.  Attentive wait staff, capable and happy to do special requests.  HUGE mugs of coffee and no one cares how long you sit.  Excellent food.  And yes from the patio you can see the strip..."}
