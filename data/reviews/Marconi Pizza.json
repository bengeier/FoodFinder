{"text":"Good for a quick pepperoni slice or veal sandwiches. The ladies at the counter are very pleasant and efficient. My delivered pie once was a tad soggy in the middle, not crispy throughout compared to eating in.   The drivers tend to leer as you place your order. Plus the storefront could use a refreshment, it's a bit bland on the curb appeal."}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza. Have a slice, you'll be convinced. Hands down best pizza in Mississauga.  Prices are reasonable and they deliver. I hope this place stays around for a long long time. A++"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza from Marconi Pizza for the first time last night, and it arrived hot and delicious!  The crust was perfect, cooked just to the right crispiness, and the toppings were fresh.  I wish I had taken a photo of the pizza, but it disappeared too quickly!!  :-)    We ordered the Super pizza, with a few extra toppings.  I suggested to the gentleman on the telephone that maybe I should get some more toppings, and instead of upselling me he suggested that what I had chosen already would be delicious and no more toppings were needed.  The crust was crispy at the edge for easy handling, and nice and soft towards the inside.  The price was comparable to other pizza places.  The delivery charge ($3) was also reasonable.  I saw some other reviews on Yelp about this place, and having now tried a Marconi Pizza I am surprised there were any reviews below four stars.  De gustibus non est disputandum....    We will definitely be ordering from Marconi Piazza again."}
{"text":"We often order from here when I visit my parents. We get a large spicy meaty thing and a slice of cheese for my 3 year old. Today I tryed to order this and was told they don't deliver slices by a extremely rude woman. I was looking at the receipt from the last time. I told her this she told me that I could order a small pizza. I didn't want a whole cheese pizza just a slice and I don't appreciate being bullied into buying something I don't want so she can sell an extra pizza. So instead I ordered from Lucas better pizza better prices better service!"}
{"text":"Been here for a few slices before. Pizza is ok, crust on the thick size. Good sauce, they have a  very well done flavor going on."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza here for the first time today. I'm a chef and have three restaurants, all of which are rated four and five stars. I heard this place was supposed to be good so thought I'd try it. First of all they insisted that I pay for the pizza before they deliver it... Say what??? I should have known then to hang up but after forty mins they delivered a soaking wet soggy pizza!!! I thought it fell in the lake and wished it did as it might have improved the horrible flavor! I called right away to complain but they put me on hold for fifteen mins just to ensure the soggy wet pizza was also now cold too add to my enjoyment. The best part of this is that the owner was not only very rude but she told me I ordered wrong and had too many toppings or the wrong toppings and if i wanted i could ask my guests to put all their pieces back in the wet box and send it back and they might send me another after they have a look at it. If i could give this place a zero i would but i can honestly say that this was not only the worst pizza but for forty bucks it was the worst service also. Order Pizza Pizza for half and trust me you will like it far more than this crappy place!!!"}
{"text":"If you want real Italian style pizza this is the place to go! It's takes your average pizza chain to school. Their sauce has great flavor, they use good quality ingredients and the pepperoni is different from anywhere else.  The veal on a bun is another great option. Buns are always fresh, veal is cooked perfectly and all for a reasonable price.  Like any pizza place slices are freshest around lunch and dinner.  I think the best strategy is to order a whole pizza, then you'll have yummy leftovers for later."}
{"text":"First time ordering delivery and found 2 hairs in my pizza.  The long one was embedded in the cheese so when I pulled the hair from my mouth, the bite I just took was still attached to the hair.  My wife then found the smaller one (beard? eyelash? pube?) on her slice.  I try to support small local businesses often, but this is just gross."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Mississauga!! Can never go wrong with a simple slice of pepperoni pizza from Marconi's. It's a great family run place with quality and well priced food and stellar service. Everytime I come in, it feels like visiting an old friend, just a warm atmosphere with tasty pizza!"}
{"text":"PIZZAHHHHH!!!!!!!  AMAZING!  DELICIOUS!! Felt like being back in Chicago and eating at a real Mom & Pop 'za shop.    We order sooo often from them."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood pizza place. Great panzerottis and pizza is very good. Best in Mississauga for me. Staff is great and very friendly."}
{"text":"If you love pizza and you're lucky enough to live in the delivery area for this place you need to order from here. Yes, you can eat there, too. But, if we have people over the party size pizzas from this place are the best deal. What is it about square cut pizza!?!?!?  The wings?  From this place are incredible. My favorite are the honey garlic. But the other varieties are just as good.  This place insists on only fresh, top quality ingredients and it shows. This pizza tastes so superior to any chain you will wonder why you never ordered from them before. It's worth the money to get the quality!"}
{"text":"Had their chicken sandwich for lunch. $7.50. Amazing!!! Soft kaiser bun, juicy chicken meat with a marenara sauce on top, topped with saut√©ed mushrooms, green peppers and mozzarella cheese. Devoured it!! Wanna come back for more! Awesome staff and great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Okay Guys This is a great pizza. the meat is spiced right.  Pepperoni pizza was delicious. The pepperonis had lovely taste to them. Smokey and peppery. The cheese was tasty as well. ingredients are of such high quality . We also order just meat bacon,pepperonis,sauage,and ground meat."}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for years - Since Paul (the original owner) started this place. Now his family (Paula and her sister and others) has taken it over and continued the same excellent tradition.  The pizza dough is great. If you like it thicker they can adjust that for you, but, we prefer it thin. Lots of choices, but, the Super is the best choice. Mmm. Sauce and other topping are very fresh and flavourful.  I believe this is the best pizza place in Mississauga. There are no better places than Marconi's. (Veal sandwiches are OK, but not the main feature at Marconi's.)  If you're in the area, you can always drop by to just pick up a slice or two of some of your favourite pizzas, as they always have a variety ready to go and just need to be heated up.   I only wish they'd extend their hours a little later on some days as you can't get enough of a good thing sometimes!"}
{"text":"I kinda loved my visit to this place with co-workers. The have amazing sandwiches and pizza are quite nice.  The owners are very friendly.The service is very good and quick. You can get your sandwiches done in a garlic bread which is quite nice. There pizza sliced are huge and one slice is like 2 so don't order too much. The menu is very reasonably priced and it looks like a bargain.  There is plenty of parking in the plaza and there is a cafe near by as well. I would try it again!"}
{"text":"Live fairly close to this place and just randomly decided to try it, but am now a huge fan. I have been back about 5 times and the quality of pizza has been consistent every time. I like my pizza a little crispier so I order it well-done and it's fantastic.  They offer a square party sized pizza that is $25 flat that we usually get it and it feeds 5 adults. I love pizza so I will try to describe the pizza to give you an idea. It's a bit greasy  (which I love) I would compare it to the same level as a Pizza Hut pizza. It's not so much that it will go through the bottom of the pizza box (if you know what i mean) but it is enough that if you are sharing it with super healthy people, they will probably comment on it. I would say they use a bit more cheese than average (which is another thing i love). The crust is thin to medium and on the softer side (which is why I order it well done). So all these factors make it one of my favourite pizza places and in my top 2 in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Greetings fellow Yelper's!  I love this place.  This is a real mom and pop shop.  The crust is awesome, the sauce is perfect.  The topping selection is average but worth a go.  I recommend the double cheese.   Outta 10:  Food - 9.5  Variety - 7  Ambience - 5 - could use an updated from the mid Chrysler minivan look.  But let's be honest.  It's clean and the pies are great!  Order one today, you will enjoy a great Mississauga Pie-gasm!"}
{"text":"While the food is reasonably good, what left a bad taste in my mouth about this establishment is the treatment of staff and customers. While I was there, I saw the woman who I presume to be the owner or manager speak to a delivery driver in a manner that was completely disrespectful and probably illegal. There are also receipts posted in blatant view of the customers which read \"asshole customer\" and so forth. I will likely seek a more ethical business for my next pizza craving."}
{"text":"After decades of ordering and eating Marconi's pizza and sandwiches I was left with a sour taste in my mouth that will probably never go away. My girlfriend really needed to use the bathroom on the way to her brother-in-law's 40th birthday party. I suggested we pull into Marconi's, which is a nice restaurant with good food and they will certainly let her use the bathroom. She went in and asked politely to use the bathroom and in front of the other customers the staff lady said \"Um...no. The bathroom is for paying customers only.\" This was very embarrassing for her and for me, as I had been the one to suggest that a nice place like Marconi's would be a safe place where she could use the restroom. I find it to be a disgraceful lack public relations and etiquette that they would turn away a long time customer, just because we were not \"paying\" customers at that moment. Not that it should matter, but my girlfriend was well dressed and groomed, not like some homeless person off the street trying to use the bathroom. We proceeded to Pizza Pizza around the corner, which had no problem letting her use the bathroom. Local small businesses should be more cognizant of how they treat those in the community. Having to use the bathroom is a basic human need, and a regular customer should not be embarrassingly denied for that need .It is unfortunate that a choice made by the staff in one moment will probably cause the permanent loss of a longterm customer."}
{"text":"I tried Marconi based on the ratings here on Yelp... Being from out of town, I can't really compare it to what else is in the area, but I thought that overall it was just OK.  The ingredients did all seem to be of high quality, but the total flavor profile in the pizza was a little lacking. The texture seemed a little bit wet for my liking with toppings/cheese sliding off. I also tried the veal sandwich based on the reviews here and again thought it was just OK.  The bun is pretty big, so I think I ended up tasting too much bread and not enough of the rest of the sandwich.  I will say that the employees were fantastic and the customer service was top notch.  I certainly wouldn't turn away from the place, but I imagine that there are probably tastier options around if you search them out."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken sandwich with mushroom and peppers. Nothing special and would not order it again. Much better from places like California Sandwich.   Ordered the super style pizza to take home. Had one slice yo try while it was still hot. Nothing special again. It was good and I would rate the pizza much higher then the sandwich.   Overall I wouldn't bother going back here."}
{"text":"I am giving this a 3 star review because all I had was a deluxe pizza slice.  It's better than Pizza Pizza, but not as good as Pizza Hut.   The crust was kind of hard, but it was acceptable and as for the pepperoni itself, it was different. They were small, finely sliced with a good pepperish taste.  Decent pizza place if you are in the neigbourhood."}
{"text":"Marconi is a small pizza shop that was doing a good business in take out and delivery for a Thursday night. The pizza was very good, we did half sausage which had some spice to it and half mushroom which were fresh. Delicious pizza in a family restaurant."}
{"text":"Great pizza, very bad decor.   Opt for the delivery, it is pricey but at least you don't have to loose appetite over dated environment."}
{"text":"The best! My family and I have been ordering from Marconi's for the past 15 years and every time it's consistently great! I've yet to have a bad experience.  Their crust and sauce are fantastic, crust is thin and crisp.  My favourites are the vegetarian pizza and the super. Don't forget about their sandwiches. The veal sandwich is tender and filling. Great portion sizes. Although they are a bit more expensive from other pizza places, it's definitely worth it for the quality of the product"}
{"text":"The best Pizza I've ever had... BY FAR. If you're cravin pizza and willing to pay a tad more, get Marconi's. Don't forget they deliver!"}
{"text":"Truthfully more 3.5 than 4 stars (no 1/2 reviews on yelp, yet...). The inside decor is very dated, looks kinda grungy.  Most important; the slices/pizza are good, close to Il Paesano or FBI, which are probably the west ends best."}
{"text":"Finally tried Marconi's And wow what a great little  Pizza place ! The pizza is fantastic very fresh great crust and amazing taste overall ! I also tried the veal sandwich and it was amazing aswell !  All in all great food decent prices and pretty quick service ! Give me a try for sure !"}
{"text":"As part of my pizza review tour with my spouse, we decided to try Marconi after hearing good word of mouth.  Location is a bit dated but the wait staff was friendly.  It does look rather dingy behind the counter - think greasy spoon.  We had two small pizzas, one without cheese for dietary reasons and various toppings.  Both pizzas came on actual plates with silverware which was nice. The pizza was rather watery/oily, much more than I could usually handle so we almost had to let our pizza's \"drain\" onto the plates before digging in. The crust was also flimsy, which gives me the impression it should have stayed in the oven longer.    The sauce was rather bland, tasted store bought and boring.  The cheese was fine aside from the excess oil.  The quantity of toppings was below average but quality wasn't bad.   Overall, I would skip this location if going for a full pizza.  In their defense, the people who suggested Marconi's to us said the quality depends entirely on who is working that day..."}
{"text":"Overall, our experience here was fine - probably on a level just above a basic pizza. We visited on a Tuesday afternoon after calling for pickup. Service was brisk but friendly. It took about 20 minutes for our call-in order to be ready.   We ordered a Medium sized (8 slices) Super Pizza (without the onions and salami), and overall, it was fine (we topped it with pepperoni, bacon, cheese, mushrooms, we asked them to add green peppers). The meat was actually quite tasty - the bacon wasn't crispy but it was fatty and delicious. The sauce had a nice hint of sweetness, and overall, the flavours were delicious. However, what fell a bit flat for was was the texture - the slice was quite flimsy, if not a bit soggy for some slices. It looks like our pie in particular may have been rolled too thin for its own good! Overall, it was alright, but not amazing.  We would come back again if we were in the neighbourhood, but I feel there's probably better pizza options in the area that's at the same price point."}
{"text":"I thought I should update my previous review of March 2013.  On a scale of 1-10, the pizza is a solid 7/10.  It's thin crust and the toppings, especially the pepperoni and sundried tomatoes, are always so fresh and tasty.  We used to get the wings a lot and they were awesome, albeit breaded. However, I think their deep fryer broke down so, nowadays, they bake the wings and they are gross (dry, burnt, overcooked) - kind of like getting a box of frozen No Name wings from Loblaws and baking them yourself for over the recommended cooking time.    I haven't ordered from Marconi for over a year now because, personally, I can't deal with that rude woman that take the orders on a Friday night.  My husband pretty much had to put her in her place.  While she apologized, it still left a bad taste in my mouth (kind of like the wings).  I'm not surprised with Tamara P.'s review about the receipts posted in blatant view of the customers which read \"asshole customer\" - very fitting of that place.  Again, with most of these Mississauga establishments, us customers are their bread and butter; treat us with respect!  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been to Marconi's quite a few times and their pizza is amazing!! Definitely one of the best in the GTA. The crust is the a good level of thinness without being overly crispy. The toppings are always fresh tasting as well. My only complaint is that they can be a little slow with delivery times, but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, like NYC style but with slightly thicker crust.  Shop and dining area really gave me a 1960/70's vibe.  Service was excellent.  One of the better pizza joints in the area in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm a pizza chain lover. I admit. I've tried this pepperoni pizza and it's pretty good...but also kinda bland. I didn't notice anything TOO special. But...  I had the Veal sandwich as well, and it is AMAZINGLY yummy. Heavy too...I could've done bicep curls with my paper bag full of 2 veal sandwiches. The price for it was awesome too, $6.50...and I didn't have to eat another meal all day! Very friendly inside as well, and clean."}
{"text":"Best pepperoni slices in the GTA hands down! I have beeen coming here for years and always order  the same thing. A single pepperoni slice. The slices are on a thin crust with a thick cut style pepperoni you don't seem find at a lot of places. If you are in this area and are craving pizza, stop by here you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"i used to work at the sdm in front of the store so ive been here countless times. i love their pizza. its fresh, the staff is friendly and well priced. like someone else said its a bit thicker than thin crust but not as thick as pizza pizza or pizza hut.  my guilty pleasure every now and then :) i usually go for whatever seems fresh out of the oven. my favorite is the Hawaiian with chili flakes added on top"}
{"text":"Wow, I had a couple of slices initially and was back a week later for a pizza. I ordered a large deluxe pizza, and like the slices, I was not disappointed. These guys do an awesome pizza and their prices are spot on. My kids, wife and myself really really love Marconi's pizza. Try it you won't be disappointed. I drive 25-minutes to pick up this pizza, well worth it."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Marconi's Pizza. Take-out / Delivery is best because the decor is for people stopping in for a quick bite. The ingredients they use are Bar-None- that's why the pizza tastes so good. Overall: Food= 4/5 Service= 4/5"}
