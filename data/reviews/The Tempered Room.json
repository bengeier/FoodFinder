{"text":"I stumbled upon the tempered room through a friend's Instagram photo and all the pastries looked fantastic.  The exterior has a goth feel, and as you step inside you are welcomed with a minimalistic rustic interior. I love the look of the place, it has a great ambience. We walk over to the counter and we are served by a nice lady and we told her to just pick anything for us. We had two cream puffs, one orange and one smores, the smores stood out for me. The texture of the pastry was soft and more dense than I expected but it worked. The filling exploded out as I took a bite. It was fantastic. We tried the caramel apple cake with sesame seeds. I really enjoyed this one, presentation was almost too beautiful to eat. But it tasted just as great as it looked. You can tell alot of care and skill was involved to create the pastries. 

It will be a matter of time before this hidden gem becomes really busy so go now while the lineups are short and enjoy some great baked goods."}
{"text":"I picked up a box of mixed croissants for my staff that were coming in to work during our office shut down. What a treat! I had the plain and almond chocolate, which were amazing. Their almond filling was so fragrant, with just enough chocolate to add some additional richness. The regular croissant was perfectly flaky and though I have been known to slather fruit preserves on my pastry, the butteriness of this croissant was perfect all on its own. 
I really look forward to trying some of the choux pastry, as well as the savoury options.  
Oh, and kudos to stocking Vams kombucha - I picked one up to feel a little healthful after indulging in breakfast pastries."}
{"text":"I am at an absolute loss to describe which sandwich here is my favourite, and as a vegetarian there are only two choices.  The croque champignons is a beautiful cheesey delightful wonderful yummy creation.  The spiced squash sandwich comes out warm and just slightly crisp with a spicy squash and cheese filling that is exciting and wonderful!

But the reality is the strength of this place is the pastries.  Try them. They all taste different and carry the flavour of the chocolate or raspberries or lemon, not just the usual insipid sweetness most commonly found in desert. 

They serve Cut coffee, some of the best in the city. The space is welcoming and bright with lots of laptop plugs and friendly staff. 

Oh yeah and the croissant.... I often hate almond croissant. I find the taste of fake almond flavouring over-powering but these delightful pastries are subtle and divine!!  The plain are crispy and flaky and the chocolate has a true taste of chocolate, not just a brown smear of sugar."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the area and in the mood for a coffee / dessert. Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. We got the almond croissant and the bread pudding + a mocha. The pastries were amazing (best almond croissant ever!!), but the coffee was lukewarm. We noticed how the barista barely heated the milk for other coffees she prepared while we were there. Fortunately, nothing could spoil my enchantment with that croissant, but I may get a regular coffee or take the pastries to go in the future."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my crossiants (I blame spending a lot of time in France) so I wasn't expecting to like the crossiants here. But I loved it! It wasn't the fluffy airy crossiants that I usually look for but super flaky and buttery. Very tastey. I'll have to try the pain au chocolates next time."}
{"text":"Best croissant in the city!! We love this little place and feel so blessed that it's in our hood."}
{"text":"The best americano going and the edibles are great! Always good service and welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Hair in my food. Hair! Curly beard hair!
Not mine, definitely not a match in colour or texture. 
I returned my food, discretely pointing to the hair and was asked if I'd like something else, which I politely declined. Didn't comp my coffee, which would have been a nice gesture.

I've been here three times and each time was not impressive.

Eclairs always taste stale & a little tough. Yesterday's stock? Huge disappointment in flavour as well. Another reviewer had the same comments.

Croissants and jalapeño bread are excellent.

Service is disinterested. No one cracks a smile, not even the owner. As if you're too cool to serve your customers?
Definitely not inviting, despite the nice decor.

Walk down to Capitol Espresso, better service, excellent coffee and lovely choice of baked goods. Yes, not as fancy looking but at a fraction of cost.

Had high hopes for this place given the owner's pedigree, and since it's local, it would have been a win-win.

Sadly, never going here again."}
{"text":"90% of their pastries have French names which is what I expected for a place that advertises itself as \"Paris in Parkdale\". However when I ordered them, the staff said: sorry I just speak English. 
Portions are on the small end, starting with 4cm. éclairs for $2.5 go look at what L'éclair de Génie offers in Paris- the city where this mediocre pastry place in Parkdale calls \"home\"."}
{"text":"People mistify me! Why would anyone give this scrumptious empire of deliciousness anything but a perfect score? From the daily scone (and the dirty one on weekends!) to the chouquettes, the bread from Thouet and each one of the most exquisite petit fours,  every item baked or sold here is absolute perfection!! Come and prove me wrong! I live two blocks over and only superhuman restraint prevents me from buying something every day. Free WiFi, good, friendly service and small details such as iced water complete the gestalt. Highly recommended!! The coffee is good too."}
{"text":"I had high hopes to try this new patisserie. The interior is warm and welcoming, but coming to the showcase of limited tarts, cake and eclair something looked odd. Yes, there are unusual flavor combinations, but I was up for it. Pear tart was ok, crust was a bit lack luster, but the bits of smoky grains on top just ruin it.
The éclairs are beautiful in neon colours, but why are they so petite? They taste dense, and it was as if they hadn't risen properly.  Overall, I felt much room for improvement  in basic technique."}
{"text":"The croissants are SO very good.  I've tried a few of their other treats along the way and they were pretty good, but I am really into their croissants.  Jalapeño bread is tasty also.  The Americano is as it needs to be.  I think the staff are lovely.  I've been served by 4 different people over time and I have found them all to be really sincere and friendly.  It is hard to be consistently nice in the service industry because half of the patrons want to suck energy out of you in a myriad of subtle ways without being aware of what they are doing.  None of them seem to have grown weary yet!"}
{"text":"This place has by far the most decadent pastries I've ever had! My family got the almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and the greatest bread pudding. All these a must tries! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"great cafe.. the japanelos corn bread was amazing.. Good service.. Great place to try if you are in the area"}
{"text":"The place looked nice but because I still was holding a half a cup of Tim Horton's coffee when I walked in they refused to seat us without me throwing away my remaining coffee. I wish I could have left a better review but I didn't get a chance to taste their food. Just the unwelcoming customer service."}
{"text":"Popped into this French bakery and glad I did. While a bit on the pricey side, we tried these little puff pastries that resembled a timbit and the black pearl. While both were excellent, the black pearl was a real treat, a definite for people who love chocolate. The place has a typical cafe atmosphere with a large communal table at the front of the place. Overall we enjoyed the cafe and would come back again if nearby."}
{"text":"The Tempered Room is one of my go to coffee places, and is a short walk from my neighbourhood.  They have an in house bakery, which is a huge plus in my books, as they always come up with new and interesting pastries and snack sized cakes from time to time.

Service is non-pretentious, and is a welcoming place for people to gather, or for me to grab a quick bite before heading out for the day.

Would try their catering services should I ever need it."}
{"text":"My go to in the neighbourhood because it's a great space to have a meeting, the coffee is awesome and the baked goods are just too good. I go here for meetings or to catch up on studying/emails.

Their flan is my favourite and highly recommended and the croissants are to die for. 

Easily accessible with a green p across the street for drivers you can't go wrong. My go to for everything and mid day meetings in the west end. There's nothing better!"}
{"text":"This place always has outstanding patisserie, cafe, and wonderfully delicious concoctions. When ever walking through the Parkdale neighbourhood, The Tempered Room is always a must. Last time we popped in it was croissants that called to me, my wife had a pesto swirled bun. The house apple cider with ginger was brilliant and the Thai Iced Tea is so good, the spices notes popping against your taste buds is not to be missed. In short if you are in the area Bertrand Alepee's place is the perfect stop for a pleasurable respite of everyday errands."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best. Incredibly gorgeous, interesting food every day in a beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for a late evening coffee and pastry - around 5:30 when they close at 7pm.  There were some paltry offerings in the pastry case.  Settled for an apple scone and an almond latte.  Stayed for around 1hr.  Only one staff working and he was on his phone the entire hour.  The place was a mess.  Empty used cups and saucers everywhere.  Water bottles were not replenished.  Tables were full of crumbs and stains.  So while the treats were quite good, I can't enjoy a relaxing cup around other people's dirt.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The last few weeks, I've found myself gravitating to this cafe (and bakery). I seem to get there pretty early on the weekends and always find a table for myself. If you arrive a little later throughout the day you may find yourself grabbing some coffee and treats to-go. 

This place is small and narrow but intimate. Upon walking in, there's a large communal table. As you walk closer to the cash, small narrow tables sit to the right on steel bars. The tables are attached to the bars and slide allowing you to push two tables together making a bigger space. At each of these little tables there's plugs, which are good for computers and a view of the glass counter displaying the food selection. The food ranges from visually appealing pastries, baguettes, sandwiches and the like, all house made from the open kitchen in the back. 

One thing I can say this is not the best place to go if you want to get work done- especially on the weekends. It seems young couples, with young children are popular amongst the crowd and some find it necessary to bring strollers in, and there's just a lack of space to do that. The last thing you want is a stroller bumping into your latte and spilling onto your computer. If you plan on sitting for a long period of time the stools are a bit hard after a while. This would be a great place to grab a coffee and a treat on a Sunday morning with a friend though, and like I said they do take-out so you could always pick up some fresh baked goods sans strollers and babies in the comfort of your home- if you're into that."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this spot. While their mini eclairs have been hit and miss (Nugateau getting it right also plays a part) their desserts have been decent. Their espresso drinks are OK. Good selection of breads to boot as well. 
With the dessert scene heating in TO I guess they fall into the mediocre category but once you factor in the location one can rate them higher as there is a dearth of good desserts in this area. I liked the apricot, lemon and pear desserts. The other desserts were a mix bag like the eclairs."}
{"text":"As an international visitor in Toronto it suprised me to taste the best Parisian Flan I ever had in The Tempereed Room.
This litte cafe has great pastries but the flan is something beyond delicious. Each time I visit the cafe I plan to taste a different flavor but again end up with two pieces of Parisian Flan.
I wish I could have stayed long enough in Toronto to be satisfied with the flan and try other pastries:)"}
{"text":"Ok I love the baked goods, sammys and croissants here. Everything here is well made with care. Kudos to the pastry chef! Really delicious baked goods. 

My issue with this place is the service. I live around the corner and have been here about half a dozen times in the last month. Twice I have walked out because of having to wait so long to have my order taken or even to be acknowledged. They are not prepared to turn over orders quickly here. Woman at cash has to put together pastry boxes to fill orders. Why aren't these boxes all ready put together? This is just one example of what holds up orders. I understand presentation is important here but each order takes far to long start to finish. I hope they fix the service issue because I would like to come here multiple times a week.

Few days later:
Ok back again this morning hoping to get a couple of their delicious Croque Monsieurs and some other pastries. Again one person serving a bunch of people and here I am waiting for too long. Not sure about the guy who works there who was sitting and chatting with a customer - could he have helped the single person serving customers so the rest of us aren't waiting so long?

This place drives me crazy and I won't be back. That was your last chance, Tempered and you failed. Terrible customer service. 

Did you even notice me walk out?  Probably not."}
{"text":"A choux pastry with Passion fruit cream and cacao nibs - one of the best things I've ever tasted.  A \"french onion soup\" flavored croissanty thing was just amazing.  What a gift to Parkdale, to Toronto. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite cafe in Toronto! Really, really good coffee and awesome chocolate croissants. Really nice staff, too. The interior decor and fittings are wonderful - such an amazing gem in Parkdale."}
{"text":"My cousin heard about this bakery opening up, and we finally got a chance to go. The decor of the place is very inviting and rustic, and their displays were very attractive.

After a long time making up our minds, we opted to get 1 of their cakes and 2 eclairs to share (we had just had a large brunch). I asked them to pack a 3rd eclair in a to-go box since buying 3 eclairs is cheaper than buying individually ($3.75 each or 3 for $10). My BFF got to enjoy this later.

Matcha framboise, $6.50: This was really good. It is (I think) a green tea mousse cube surrounded by a layer of raspberry mousse. The outside is slightly hardened, like those marshmallows that are a little hard. Presentation is very  nice and the flavours complimented each other. It is not a heavy dessert at all and I highly recommend it, despite the high price point.

Chocolate passionfruit eclair: Only okay. The eclair was a little tough/hard as if it could have been day old. The icing on top was like an almond fondant, which was not mentioned in the flavouring. Flavours were nothing amazing. My BFF did not comment on it so I believe he did not enjoy it either.

Pistachio cherry eclair: A huge let down. There was not much pistachio taste and essentially no cherry taste. I think they meant to have the pistachio cherry on the top and the inside of the eclair was just regular custard.

Washrooms are downstairs and very clean.

I might come back to try the croissants, as I heard that they are to die for. Apparently, when you bite into it, you will instantly be brought to a cafe Paris, according to my boss. Too bad I didn't think to ask him before I went!"}
{"text":"The Tempered Spoon has the most amazing pastries and baked goods. Their almond croissant and flan are my go-to. The coffee is decent but nothing too special."}
{"text":"I had the rose & raspberry eclair, my friend the raspberry, chocolate croissant.

The eclair was lovely but I would of like 2 more bites. It was about 2\" long. $3

The croissant was soggy from too much chocolate and butter so the flakiness was missing.

I really liked my eclair and I may go back to try their plain croissant.

The Americano was ok.

Both items would need to be good for them to get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Deliiiiicious pastry. I had a plain butter then a chocolate croissant with my earl grey tea. Great little space, a pleasant place to work as there are power points and the wifi was good. Lady at the counter wasn't the friendliest but I'll come back for my croissant fix for sure."}
{"text":"Caution: Do not eat the Ham & Cheese Croissants sitting in the display! It was obviously not freshly made, must have been sitting there from the previous day. They did ask if we wanted it heated up (which would have likely helped with the fact that it was dry and stale); I opted out because of the walk we had ahead of us... needless to say it was a total disappointment. I ordered mine with no cheese and it took 10 mins to put together but at least it was a fresh croissant... much better but the $9 price tag is certainly not justified."}
{"text":"We came here on a personal recommendation (and... after reading Yelp reviews)  - and am I ever glad we did.

With great (American style) coffee, a small but wonderful tea collection, fabulous sandwiches (for breakfast and lunch) and a beautiful selection of pastries, as well as some fresh bread, I can see why this place gets consistently great reviews.  They also have specialty coffees, though we didn't try any.

I had a smoked trout sandwich and the Tempered Room specialty tea mix.  Both were delicious! Hubby had the (bacon) breakfast sandwich and was enthusiastic about it.  I had a bite and it was delicious.   He was also very satisfied with his coffee - and I had a sip of that and I can see why.

A great solution for a narrow space was provided along the wall by the cash, with built in tables and stools where two people could perch to eat, or one person with a laptop could be very productive.  A coat rack at the front ensure you didn't need to feel crowded by winter clothing in the limited space. Community seating at the front of the house is perfect for those of us that thrive on being surrounded by others.  The feel is light and comfortable with beautifully (and we think authentically) aged walls and exposed brick.

Staff were great and answered all of our questions.

Would I return:  Yes.  This will become a regular stop for us when we are in town.
Would I recommend:  Yes, enthusiastically to those that love sandwiches and pastries. :-)"}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to the Parkdale area.  It's got a comfortable vibe and the aroma of baked goodness so you can't go wrong.

It's got a communal table and several smaller tables usually occupied by one person with laptop in the back area. 

I'm not totally sold on the coffee. I've come here enough times to realize, it's not their strength. It's not a bad brew but I'm holding out hope they try a different roaster.

Where they do shine, is exactly what their website extols - their baked sweet and savoury products.It kind of makes up for the coffee in my mind."}
{"text":"Americano is underwhelming.

Shout outs to the chocolate croissant - flakey and buttery. One of the best chocolate croissants I've had. Ask for it to be heated. It tastes amazing like that!"}
{"text":"In visiting toronto and walked here cause it was recommended from my air bnb. It was a very cute place but not much seating and definitely not equipped for a group of 6 if there are any other patrons. Mini quiche was delicious and very cheesy. My cappachino was delicious but the iced latte was not my favorite. Would definitely come again with a smaller group and my laptop"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

After spending a month in France earlier this year I've been having some major pastry cravings, so I was excited to try The Tempered Room.

I loved the ambiance of the place, with the exposed brick, communal table and overall cozy feel.

Staff was very friendly and helpful. We ordered a couple of cappuccinos and a croque monsieur to enjoy there and a couple of pastries to go (which we ate a few hours later after dinner). We got the chocolate passion eclair and a pear tart. Also half a dozen chouquettes. All of the above ran us close to $30.

Coffee was good, the sandwich was okay. The eclair was a bit of a let-down. As another reviewer noted the choux pastry was a bit hard/dry, the flavours unmemorable and the dried passionfruit on top was much chewier than I was expecting. 

The pear cream tart on the other hand was divine. The crust was the perfect texture, as was the filling. The poached pears on top were just right. The chouquettes were also very good, a little smaller than the ones I got in France but nice and tender (which makes me even more surprised about the eclair). 

I'll have to go back to try the croissants - they looked amazing."}
{"text":"The croissant was expensive and wasn't flaky.  The coffee is good, but the staff there are kind of kuntie. I've had the croque monsieur there a couple of times which looks delicious but they don't heat it up enough and its not all that it could be."}
{"text":"Stepping into the empty store on a early Saturday morning, I was greeted by display cases full of baked goods and alot of choice. Everything looked really appetizing and prompted an internal debate between the French onion soup roll (apparently they sell out quick - only one left even this early) or something sweet. The pile of croissants looked too good to pass up so a chocolate and almond croissant won the debate. 

The croissants are deceptively substantial, filled with layers upon layers of pastry and chocolate. It was actually heavy to pick up, but delicious from beginning to end. A wonderful way to start the day. Will definitely be back to try the other tempting treats behind the glass case."}
{"text":"I think we miss ordered. I fully intend to try this trendy bakery again on our next trip to Toronto.

My fiance and I had breakfast at The Tempered Room while visiting Toronto this past weekend. Two cappuccinos, an almond croissant, a chocolate croissant, a plain croissant, and  brioche with chocolate and a jam glaze. The chocolate croissant and plain croissant were our favorite! Both light and buttery with a flakiness that was to die for, as good as any croissant we have every had here or over seas. The almond croissant and brioche were too sweet for us, however they did have salted brioche bites that probably would have been a much better choice for us. 

Trendy fun spot with an \"open\" bakery, easy and cheap street parking, and friendly workers. Give this one a try for your next cup of joe."}
{"text":"Reading over the past reviews it appears as though their weak spot has been their coffee, but I popped in today for a latte and I absolutely loved it. I'm thinking they did some reading up on these Yelp reviews and fixed that situation! Seriously though, great coffee. Some of the best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this cafe, it used to be my go-to place for coffee and laptop work! The coffee is amazing, and the pastry selection is excellent compared to other nearby cafes. The croissants, scones, and sandwiches are all good! My favorite was this French onion soup pastry, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. The place is really cute, and I love sitting at the big communal table at the front or by the window. Staff is friendly and knew me by name. Definitely a place to check out if you're around!"}
{"text":"Perfect little spot to grab a (good) coffee and treat; savory or sweet. Jalapeño cornbread was a generous portion (would've been even better served with whipped butter) and the almond croissant was unbelievable!! Next time I'm coming back for the French onion soup roll (they were sold out this time)"}
{"text":"This cute Parkdale cafe is ideal for waking up in style and long afternoon chats. I highly recommend ordering treats to go - you'll be sure to impress. The menu items are all exquisite to look at, so I'd better get back there and try them all! The only thing I'd strongly recommend here is comfy chairs - the tiny adjustable stools look quaint, but they're not very comfortable."}
{"text":"Wow this place rules. Coffee is great and reasonably priced, the food is incredible (try the croque monseur or the French onion soup bread), and very nice atmosphere. The baristas are very friendly and this place has an easygoing vibe. I don't have a sweet tooth so I don't order any of the pastries but I've heard that's the best part!"}
{"text":"Updating this to a 4.5 star after my most recent visit.. So many good things were savoured here today!  But giving it a 5 star as their staff is very humble on creating great amazing baked goods and super friendly. 

My latest was following a brunch disaster at Mitzi's and we were dying for a caffeine hit of worthy of a 5 star.  I knew Tempered room was good and so we treked out here.  I'm so glad we did.  We arrived just before 11 am and took up a cozy seating and fixed our brunch doldrums with one of the best croissants and bread pudding I've tried in Toronto.

This bakery cafe is constantly in quick motion with making very good espresso based drinks and baking new batches of croissants and savoury goods throughout our time here.  Service is quick but also very warm and welcoming ... especially when they start to recognize you.  

We at first only wanted a good flat white but we were tempted by the seasonal Strawberry scone, freshly made bread pudding, lovely decorated flan (and a favourite of my last visit), and hot from the oven dark chocolate and almond croissant.  Everything we had today could not be improved and made our taste buds dance.  

Flat White - Highly flavourful, bold with no bitterness, and perfectly balanced with the milk to make it a richly creamy drink.  This was really well done and made me sad that I drank it all.  I'm docking a 0.5 mark because they ran out of Almond milk but they did have Soy.  4.5/5

Strawberry Scone - A soft tender crumb that is near cake like except the crust has a sugar crystal crust that hides big chunks of flavourful strawberries.  A very good scone!  4/5

Flan - Once again, this creamy, smooth, and strong natural vanilla flan is the stuff of dreams.  It's almost like a creme brulee with it's creamy texture.  This is possibly one of the best flan I've had in Toronto.  5/5

Bread Pudding - This is a decadent treat that is filled with dark chocolate, sweet almond silces, and rich custard that just enveloped all the bread pieces.  We heated it up a bit in the oven before eating and it smells of marzipan.  Each piece was so rich and well balanced... it wasn't too sweet because the dark chocolate just adds a note of velvety bittersweet cocoa.  You have to share this because it's so rich.  Also, here's an honest opinion from a 7 year old that calls it like it is.  Here's the direct quote \" They should call this Yum Pudding\".  I can't give it a higher compliment.  5/5

Chocolate Almond Croissant - When we first arrived at 10:30 am, all of the chocolate croissants and chocolate almond croissants were sold out and a few almond ones were left.  Just before 11 am, a huge tray of freshly baked almond, chocolate, and chocolate almond croissant appeared.  We couldn't resist the heavenly butter scent wafting through the bakery.  We chose the chocolate almond croissant and were completely floored on how amazing it tasted.  Layers of buttery goodness alternated with molten bittersweet dark chocolate and marzipan like creamy grounded almonds.  This was just incredible.  5/5

Overall, this place keeps getting better with each return.  Next I'll try the choux or one of their savoury options and see how if their streak of near perfect continues."}
{"text":"Croissants are not in my top 3 in Toronto for sure, but there is some potential. When you need your croissants to be warmed up to taste good, it means that there is some problem somewhere... but warm they are not so bad at all, or with lot of Nutella or jam... cold, they taste like having been kept for 2 days before being sold, and frozen-unfrozen to allow so (i.e. on the dry, heavy but no longer fluffy. light or buttery side).

Pains au chocolat are just OK as well. 

Service is OK, pastries are nothing major. Not cheap neither."}
{"text":"Found this cute little bakery/cafe place in parkdale on yelp and decided to visit. I loved the rustic yet modern feel when you walk into this place. It felt very comforting. All their baked goods smelled amazing, plus it doesnt cost an arm and leg for the cute desserts! ($8 for 3choices) Thats almost unheard of in toronto nowadays. Id definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Bright, chic, friendly coffeeshop/bakery with divine treats! My favorite place to work from in Parkdale!"}
{"text":"Have always been big fan of Bertrand Alépée aka The Tempered Chef (@TheTemperedChef) and until now, I've only been able to taste his creation during events or special pop-up dinners (like here and here). So I was super excited when he opened up The Tempered Room (@thetemperedroom) about 2 months ago and we finally found time to drop by this pass weekend.

 Alépée and his pasty chef Tyler Lang did most of the wood work of the space and what a great job.
Love the expose un-finish brick walls and the simple wood display cases which was perfect backdrop for all the sweet creations. There a large communal table at the front and small side tables that can be pop on and off the wall's railing.

 Beverages wise Sam James Coffee, tea and bottled Vams Kombucha are available. While most things are make in house, the breads are from The Drake, Blackbird Baking Co and Thuet.
 
Somehow I find other cities have a lot of Eclairs choice, it's rather lacking in Toronto and I was so glad that they emphasize them here.

 I basically wanted to try everything but we just had lunch, so I guess we'll have to come back on an empty stomach

Passion Chocolate  Eclair $3.50
~ Love the flavor of the pastry here and I am usually not a fan of éclair at most places because I find the icing/coating way too sweet but the one here was so perfect.
~ Need to try the other flavors next time!

PB & J Choux $2.50
~ Love the peanut butter crust here which give it an extra crunch to the pillowy jam filled choux pastry.

 Pomme Caramal Salé $5.75
~ Love love love Need I say more?!
~ Pretty and Perfect!!! A salted caramel mousse cake with homemade crabapple jelly, sesame caramel ganache. 
~ Would never hove though sesame with this dessert but it totally elevated the whole cake to another level of amazingness. 

Croissant $2.50
~ After eating the 3pcs above, I can't help but crave for the croissants... but it was sold out, noooooo! 
~ But we were kindly told that another batch is coming out in 20 minutes and let's just say, it was all worth the wait. 
~ Having worked in Paris with Michelin starred chefs like Guy Savoy and Alain Ducasse, Alépée's partry is the real thing.


Verdict:
~ Love love everything we had, will definitely be back for more
~ We also bought a Jalapeno Cornbread home and it was still moist and delicious the next day
~ Would love to try their flan and bread next time
~ And rumors has it that there's plan of hosting future pop up dinner of The Group of Seven Chefs in this space.

{"text":"I've been here plenty of times to grab coffee or pastries. Love the lunch selection (the ham and cheese croissant is amazing!). The pastries are also great as well! Staff are always friendly and I always seem to find a place to sit as it is not overcrowded with people on laptops. I will definitely be back for more in the future!"}
{"text":"The Tempered Room is one of the most hipster coffee shops/bakeries in Toronto. From the wood, minimalist design to the simple coat rack with iron hangers, it's perfect. 

It's a coffee shop brewing all kinds of coffee from drip to lattes. In addition, it's a French bakery with really good pastries from savory to sweet like their divine nutella roll. Wow. It's the dream for any chocolate lover.

They also have plenty of seats from chairs to small tables to a long table for community sitting."}
