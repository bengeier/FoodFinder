{"text":"Authentic turkish food. The iskender is heavenly. Bread is freshly baked in the store. The rice is delicious. Generous portions -- I leave feeling full, which is unusual for me. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken doner dinner plate through skip the dishes. The salad which was included in the dinner plate was missing; skip the dishes tried contacting the restaurant however they were not successful. The taste of the doner (shwarma) was okay. Rice was a bit overdone. However, the reason for the one star is because within an hour of consuming this meal, I became violently ill. Stomach pain and endless bathroom trips. I would never ever order food from this establishment again."}
{"text":"It was okay, I wouldn't go again. I asked for olives on my kebab and he simply said no with no explanation It came off disrespectful and it made me feel like I was in line with the 'Soup Nazi' ( quoting the seinfeld episode. )"}
{"text":"This place has the best doner in town. The owner makes everything in the house including the breads which soooo fresh and delicious. I love their paca soup. So much flavor in it and iskender kebab i had for main was the best food i had. My bf had mixed pide and the crust was so crispy and yummy. I usually dessert  person but i gotta say you must try their kunefe. Make sure ask server to prepare 10 mins early if u want to have right away after ur meal since it takes time to bake.   I have to go back once a while because i just  crave for the authentic flavors!  Great place!"}
{"text":"One of the best Turkish restaurants in Toronto (for what it's worth, I grew up in Turkey). Great, friendly owner who's behind the counter every time I've been there. We order delivery or eat in fairly regularly and they've never disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the quick and fresh food otherwise, this is not my favourite fast food. Other people's   opinions vary but in my opinion, the food was VERY DRY. Otherwise, this store have kind waiters, fresh food, and fairly priced meals."}
{"text":"Dissatisfied. Not delicious. I didn't like this place. Unprofessional. I don't recommend this business."}
{"text":"Ordered the Garden platter for take-out. First time trying this place and it was fantastic! The kofte was really flavourful and better then other places I've tried. The chicken kebob was nicely marinated and delicious. Also enjoyed the two types of rice in the platter. The platter was perfect for two very hungry people. I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Best kebab restaurant in the GTA. I'm not exaggerating try and see."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants. The food is delicious. You get big portions for the price you pay. Good customer service. The food usually comes fast. I come here with my friend at least once a week. The desserts are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Been driving by this new Kebab place for weeks. Finally went in with my son to check it out.  Really friendly Turkish family runs it. My son had a beef shawarma wrap - it was awesome. Just the right mix of ingredients - some places try too hard - too many flavors.  This was perfect - great beef - great sauce.  I had the spicy ground lamb kebab - WOW. exceptional flavor - cooked perfectly. Nice char on the outside,juicy on the inside. We bought a homemade rice pudding to take home. This is definitely worth checking out.  PS - The shawarma are 2 for $7!!! Crazy for this quality."}
{"text":"This is a relatively small place, but has amazing food that is prepared fresh. I tried Beyti Kebab and it was delicious. Adana is another great one. I eat a lot of Turkish food and this place has great taste.   Friendly staff serving lot of customers quickly. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tasty food and fast delivery from uber eats. I will keep ordering from these guys. I just have to remember to ask for the sauces next time because they dont put on any unless you specifically order it."}
{"text":"Have been to this place countless times before and everything was great. However, last few times we went there the food was simply terrible.  Chicken wrap:  Chicken in the wrap was cold, we asked no onions and guess what... there were onions in it and not just regular onions but HUGE chunks.  I had to repeat myself 6 times about the sauces because apparently, it is really hard to remember. When I started eating, there were NO sauces at all!! Asked for feta cheese-no feta cheese The wrap was falling apart in my hands   Rice pudding:  Rice pudding is a whole different story. Usually, I love it and get it there all the time. This time it was all stale with chunks of rice at the bottom ( impossible to scrape out) and portion cut in half.  Not gonna be coming back after that experience."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I was actually really surprised by how great the food was. It was a little hidden and I randomly passed by it. I ordered the family platters for a gathering I was having. All of my guests also said they loved the food! Will definitely come back to Beyti Kebab!"}
{"text":"Really good family run Turkish restaurant. We tried the mixed dinner plates and a pizza.  Dinner plates are med-large portions.  Definitely a visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"The Lahmacun is well-spiced and inexpensive.  I usually get the chicken shish kebab or the beef doner plate.  Be careful of the little green chili pepper that's on the side - it's very hot!  Their daily specials are really good value."}
{"text":"Amazing! Not fancy but if your looking for authentic tasty quality this is what you want. Service is ok at best but the food makes up for that easily."}
{"text":"The place is super clean, firstly the beef doner is your #1 choice! Two  sandwiches for 6.99 only. The beef is just great, I go with tomatoes, onions, and tahini sauce only as this is original for beef toppings. Garlic and pickles, fries for chicken as Levant style.   The cashier is nice, helpful and friendly. They have some exotic pop drinks. I'm coming again to try their kebab, they have one meter long shish."}
{"text":"Went by yelp reviews and it was worth it. Delicious kebabs. Simple and worth the money. Don't forget to order the yogurt drink 'ayran'. Delicious:) Quick service. Washrooms are clean meaning that the kitchen is clean."}
{"text":"Thanks to Steph S for this idea.  What a hidden little gem.   Clean clean clean.  Eat in or take out.   I think they must have the cheapest Doner Wrap Specials in the GTA!  7 buck for two decent sized Beef or Chicken Doner Wraps.  These are a must try.  I ordered 4 of them and were they ever so delicious.  2 Chickens and 2 Beefs.   I had trouble with this one thing though.  While inhaling the Beef Doner, I tasted hints Lamb?!?!  Dont get me wrong my friends, it was lovely surprise.  Was the Beef Doner a mix of Lamb and Beef.   Or could it have been the crumbled white cheese that added to my wrap??? Goat cheese???  Anywho, the Beef and Chicken wraps, IMO, were both yummy and will keep me coming back for more.   Peace out!"}
{"text":"Awful, awful, experience at Beyti Kebab and I hope the owner reads this.   I went to Beyti Kebab tonight to get dinner with my brother. 10 minutes after we order, my brother gets his food and I still haven't received my wrap (#26 on their menu).   The cashier proceeds to ask us why we are still in the store. I tell her that I'm still waiting for the lamb wrap that I ordered. She responds by saying that she never printed my order for the chef. So she prints the slip, and even though she made a mistake, she puts my slip at the very back of the queue so everybody else that has ordered since then will get their food before me.   Later, I point out how I've been waiting 20 minutes for a simple lamb wrap to the chef and he starts to argue with me over the food. He kept insisting that the situation is 100% the cashier's fault and that he has no power to fix anything, even though he's the one that's actually doing the cooking. It was almost as if I was talking to a robot that MUST cook the food in the order of the slips, regardless of mistakes/situations like the ongoing one. Cooking in the order of the slips is simply what this robot is programmed to do, and acting outside of his programming will cause him to short-circuit.  The owner then walks in and sees the chef arguing with me from the other side of the counter.  5 more minutes pass, still no wrap, and I start to demand my money back. The owner sees me at the cash asking to be refunded and he steps in and says he will cook my food himself. It took him about 2 minutes to cook and serve me the wrap I ordered 25 minutes ago.   As I leave the store, another customer starts making the same complaint that I did. He ordered 2 dinners but was only served one because the cashier only punched in 1/2 of the dinners.   Avoid this place like the plague. They really don't have it together. Awful communication between the people that work there."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats. 4 bland pieces of chicken on really oily rice. Soggy Salad. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Simply Delicious an Amazing !! Real turkish food and the owners taking care, definitely recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Willing to edit this after a second try but for now, 3 stars.  Working across from the nearby Kebab 49 i have a pretty good read on Turkish food. I am tired of kebab 49's utterly useless, confused and disorganised service so tried this place instead.   The Lamachun is cheap and i ordered mild rather than spicy but it was definitely spicy. Now not sure if I got a spicy or if mild is really spicy and hot is on fire? No idea. But it was too hot for my son which was a real pain in the rear. The Lamachun bread itself was pale and undercooked yet hard compared to kebab 49 and the toppings more sparse.   Also ordered the \"beyti Special\"  which is two adana skewers, two lamb shish skewers, and two chicken shish skewers, served with rice, barbecued tomatoes and hot peppers, house-made bread, salad, and tzatziki sauce.  Bread felt stale and heavy compared to Kebab 49.  Adana skewer was quite spicy, not sure if this is the norm so if it is I retract the complaint.   Lamb shish extremely tasty and moist but far, far too salty.  Chicken Shish is excellent.   Salad is 99% raw onion and iceberg lettuce.   Overall, lot's of potential and definitely cheaper than Kebab 49 but for this experience, 3 stars is fair."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place and I fell  In love totally !  It's a little hidden off today Dundas right behind the dunwynn center . Small little place when you walk in , decent menu selection .  Food is excellent some portions could be a little bigger as my friend ended up ordering more food but it is tasty !  There pide is Awsome and everything is made fresh .  I will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"First of all I have to say the food is very flavourful and good. However you do not get what you pay for. You really do not get what you pay for. I ordered a mix grill and they really cheapened out on the chicken breast. Just to make an extra dollar or so they cheapened out on the meat. The service here sucks very slow. Second time going here. You'd be confused every time  you go. No friendly service at all."}
{"text":"Five star beyti kebab here. Soooo yummy! Try kunefe dessert as it is very hard to find a good one in Toronto."}
{"text":"Beyti delivers, and not just to your door. I had recently been on the hunt for some delicious Mediterranean meats and then stumbled on this gem. Most Mediterranean establishments give you modest amounts of meat in their mixed grills, but not Beyti. The Mixed grill here is so packed full of meat that it makes all other mixed grills seem mediocre. The different flavours offered here are exceptional. I had just finished a workout when it arrived and I could feel my muscles bulging with each bite. If that's not enough, you also have the option to add extra meat! The meal comes with rice and a salad as well. Make sure to get a couple sides of the sauces they offer to compliment the meat. The fresh bread they bake and include is just sublime. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hidden Turkish eatery, on the ground level, located on a mid-rise Commercial building on a not-so-nice strip of Dundas, just East of Dixie.  If you blink, especially with all that construction that's taking place in the area, you'll miss it!  I *believe* there's a bingo place on the top floor of this building, but I can be wrong.  Tip:  Unless you're travelling East on Dundas, enter via Mattawa and drive around the back of the building to park on the side of the restaurant.  Plenty of parking available...you just hafta find it!  Interior is nice and clean.  Don't be intimidated just 'cause it isn't in the squeaky new Costco plaza next door.  Server was very friendly and willing to answer any questions I & fellow Yelper, Adrienne had for him as first-timers.  I ordered the Adana Kabob ($11.99, good portion, enough for 2ppl) and Ayran (not what I expected, not as gross as a salty lassi, but it was a bit tart/salty).  Adana Kabob came with a side salad which had a delicious, creamy dressing (usually I don't like creamy sauces), bread that looked like the Afghani naan (not as good, quite dense and heavier), & rice.  I have had better Adana, but this was pretty good, not to mention good portion size for the price point.  I had a piece of Baklava and it's different from what they serve at Baklawa King (across the street).  Baklava tasted fresh and the pastry at the bottom was soaked in syrup as opposed to being crunchy like it is at Baklawa King.  Still good, but it's different.  Turkish coffee tasted like a strong, black coffee/espresso - you're supposed to have it black.    We also asked for the complimentary Turkish tea, which most places to offer (re:  Paramount, Almonasabah), and it just tasted like black tea, no hint of cardamon...not sure if it's supposed to have this.  Still good and black, not supposed to be served with milk.  Overall, I'd recommend this place and go back to try the Doner/Pide!  Service was very friendly, so that would definitely a bonus."}
{"text":"I had their Monday special beef doner for the $10.99+tax.  What a waste of $$$$$. More than half of the beef that they called shawarma was all fat thin sliced beef...how can they pass that off as beef doner.  I recommend you to NOT ever order their beef doner. I had to throw out more  the half of the order but the only good came out of the special was the salad and bread. So I spend $11 on salad and bread. Unless they change their meat I will never dine there again."}
{"text":"The humus and fresh bread were a great start to the meal, I liked the attention to detail, and the freshness of the ingredients, especially the side salad to my Chicken Kabab. We also ordered the Yogurt Kabab. and Paça."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant but I'm giving thumbs down because they stopped delivering to Lakeshore through UberEATS. Seriously, it is 6-7 mins drive. I'm very disappointed because I loved this restaurant so much.  Also, Kunefe didnt have cheese in it. It's unacceptable and it doesn't make it any different than kadayif, which is $2 less in their menu. If one of the main ingredients is missing, you should specify it because otherwise it is false advertising."}
{"text":"Food was great for it's price. Customer service wasn't as good b cause they were short staffed. I saw a sign that said waitress and dishwasher hiring. The experience itself was not that bad. And also they had free hot tea. Which helped with the headache I had. Thanks!"}
