{"text":"Went in today for lunch and decided to try the buffet. Everything was really good, especially the buffalo chicken pizza. My toddler enjoyed the spaghetti and I think this will become one of our regular go-to spots."}
{"text":"While I don't normally eat in this restaruant, I can't argue with the previous poster. However when it comes to Pizza, this place can't be beat.  It is bar none, the best pizza in the Tega Cay/Fort Mill area.  This includes the way overpriced Carmellas over near Carowinds.  Better yet, they send out coupons monthly in the mail that can be redeemed for $ off your order.

Unfortunately, Village Pizza closed it's doors thus I have dropped the rating to 1 star to reflect this.  Another pizza restaurant has opened up in it's place but I have not yet had their food."}
{"text":"First part: Almost giving five star to this place. Good pizza dough and tomato sauce but few pepperoni and cheese for $26 pizza. Second part:  I just finished the pizza. My eyes are bigger than my stomach. You don't need much ingredients on this pizza. It's rich brothers and sisters. I am full, satisfied and definitely coming back to this place. So looks like four star on top but five star in my heart."}
{"text":"We tried this place tonight (the two kids shared a large margherita and the two adults had a beet salad and mushroom pizza). The food was excellent - better than Terroni. It is a casual place where you order/pay at the counter. I liked the atmosphere, but I didn't like having to eat on very thin paper plates. For the price, I think they could provide plates!"}
{"text":"I agree with another poster on the review about Village Pizza being compared to Dominos. I have to say tag lines of \"Real Italian Food\" caught my eye and sparked my interest. unfortunately, I was let down. There is nothing authentically Italian about this eatery. Staff was upbeat and nice , pizza buffet was sparse and pizza looked old. It was right around dinner time , so if anything, that's when the buffet should  be stocked with choices.  We ordered a pizza with meatball and pepperoni, and a side of mozzarella sticks. Sauce was decent and sticks were good, toppings were fresh. It's convenient, if you live in the area, but I don't understand all the hype."}
{"text":"Really amazing pizza with really delicious toppings! Definitely my fave in the city! I wish that delivery started a little earlier than 6pm."}
{"text":"First time back since the original owners returned, thought it would be just like before they left. Sadly, the new restaurant doesn't quite measure up like I remember from a few years ago. The Pizza was a little tough and chewey, with too much cheese and not enough tomato sauce. Was ok, but there are better pizza's around, will probably not be returning. Service was ok but not outstanding."}
{"text":"The salad bar now has Romaine instead of iceburg lettuce! THANK YOU!!! I am thrilled!!!"}
{"text":"Ginny may possibly be the best cook around! Village Pizza really is Italian food at it's best! Ordering from the menu or getting the pizza/salad bar, you really can't go wrong!  Lots of different pizzas to choose from on the bar as well as some pastas as well."}
{"text":"As a spaghetti and meatball connoisseur, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of their plate! I particularly loved the seasoning on their giant meatballs, but I've never been a fan of thick spaghetti. Great overall, though!  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place has everything I look for in a casual ristorante! Great pizza, subs and pasta dishes your mamma should have made! The servers are quick and attentive and the owners are usually out making their rounds as well.

We've eaten here over 4 times now and each time left well fed and happy. My favorite so far has to be the sausage and peppers pasta. It's a must-try. The pizza and salad buffet is always good when you can't decide on an entree and even comes with pastas. If you're not in the mood for something heavy, the Italian sub is perfect. We've even taken them out on the lake - perfect for the cooler.

So glad this place has reopened with the original owners! Mangia!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the eggplant parmesan only. 
I'm from Connecticut and have been looking for a good eggplant parm in the area. I thought I would give Village Pizza a try. I ordered an eggplant parmesan grinder. It is among the best I've had! Freshness, flavor and quality was superb. 
I can't wait to go back for another one. I also am looking forward to trying their pizza, and other dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Always satisfies my craving for some fresh, hot and crispy thin crust pizza.

My favourite is the Mushroom Trio, I haven't found a mushroom pizza quite like this since I've had it. I tried the vegan pizza today for the first time and it was a pleasant surprise.

Highly recommend this and looking forward to going again this weekend, even though I was just there tonight!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service. 
Visited at least once a week while doing a summer internship in the area. As a friend noted \"$5 for a slice is a bit expensive, but I don't feel gross like I do after eating Pizza Pizza or at other cheap pizza joints\". 

Will definitely visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Decided on takeout last night - lasagna and chicken parm sandwich. Both were outstanding!!! This is more than a pizza place so don't forget to try other things than the buffet - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So glad to finally have a decent pizza joint in the neighbourhood. I have grabbed slices a few times, ordered delivery once (which they mistook as a take out order but rectified quickly), and done pick up.

Pizza was tasty every time. The hot sauce is excellent.

I do hope they vary the \"prefab\" menu items because at $3 per item, building your own pizza can get expensive quickly, and I'll tire of the one non-margarita option that appeals to me right now."}
{"text":"As you can see from the pictures, we couldn't wait to dig in. This place just opened up around the corner from us and we are happy that it did.
Not a huge menu, but I think that is better because it doesn't take long to decide.
The pizza we got was huge and we didn't need to order anything else, will try the other flavours on our next visits.
The drinks locally sourced from a place in Burlington.

Highly recommend, come early to avoid lines."}
{"text":"This place was taken over and remodeled recently(within the last 4 months). The new owners seem to get it. This place is great for the value. I would ignore any posts older than 4 months or so since it is not the same place."}
{"text":"Christian Organization, Friendly People and Tasty Food! Can't get any better. Definitely the best place in the area to get a calzone."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, best delivery pizza in my area.  Really nice people as well.  You should check them out."}
{"text":"1.5 stars. It was very clean and service was prompt at the door. The pizza was pretty good. However, the buffet is small. We came in around 1 and left at 2 and the only vegetarian options for pizza put out during that time were 6 slices of cheese. I did ask for vegetarian options but everything they continued to put out had pepperoni on it. I was taking my 14 year old out to eat as a reward, so this was very disappointing. He only got 3 slices of pizza and was prepared to pig out. We came for pizza and got six slices (total) for $15.80...would have been better off just getting a box of something. We left highly disappointed. We did try the breadsticks which were bland and no marinara to dress it up. They also tasted old, as did the cinnamon sticks. I just thought I should mention this just in case anyone decides on this place based on Yelp and doesn't eat beef or pork like us."}
{"text":"My first stop when I visit Fort Mill is Village Pizza!  I haven't lived there for over 10 years, but whenever I'm back in town, it's at the top of my list for places to visit. I LOVE their pizza- the Red Veggie is my favorite. They definitely have the best sauce in the Fort Mill/Steele Creek area. I have tried almost everything on their menu and it is ALL delicious!  My favorite dishes are: the Stromboli, the Chicken Parm, and the Hot Roast Beef sandwich with Au Jus- yum!  My husband's favorite is their homemade lasagna, which he says is better than his Nonna's. The owner Ginny is so sweet and always remembers me and asks about my family. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had their Deluxe Pizza and Lasagne dinner for carry out. Both were excellent. I will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever. Staff is awesome and the food is unreal. Have ordered delivery, full pies and slices. Just opened on Dundas too."}
{"text":"I stopped in there last night with a previous co-worker to catch up and grab a bite to eat. He remembered coming here back in his High School days and since I live in Tega Cay I figured it would be a great place to check out. We both got the Buffet and right off the bat the waitress asked what we liked as she would make sure it was made up for the buffet. The only problem I had is the White Pizza that I requested is a premium pizza and not buffet eligible. But, she did give us some recommendations and when a Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ pizza was put on the line she brought us over a couple of slices to try. It was the best pizza I had! She was Johnny on the SPOT with drink refills and checking on us even though there wasn't an empty table in the place. Ronnee was the waitress name and I will say each time I go back  I will be requesting her! Great job!!"}
{"text":"This is just a review for their tacos - which, yes, I realize is rather strange considering it's called Village Pizza. But this place is owned by a Mexican family and their tacos are absolutely delicious! I have been searching for a good street taco place in Madison because I'm that stereotypical Californian who's obsessed with tacos. So I was super happy to find out from a coworker that Village Pizza has a yummy (and cheap! $2 a taco) Taco Tuesday. 

They have four types of meat: steak, el pastor, carnitas, and chicken. My personal favorites are the el pastor and steak but you can't go wrong with any choice. They're served street style in a corn tortilla and topped with onions and cilantro. They also supply a tasty red and green salsa. They also sell their own horchata and jamaica water, which also reminds me of home. 

Definitely check this place out for the tacos, it's as authentic as I've tried in Madison for sure."}
{"text":"Saw the sign out on Bloor St. W. advertising \"real\" pizza and feeling hungry I decided it was worth checking out. It's small sit down restaurant, decor feels kinda homey with an emphasis on wood and then a rather out of place graffiti tag across one wall. It was the middle of the afternoon so the place only had a couple of customers. The woman at the counter was friendly and attentive. Noticed this is one of the few places you can get what can be considered a \"gourmet\" pizza by the slice. It's a plus for those who merely want a quick slice, on the other hand it's not going to be as good and as fresh as out of the oven, freshly topped pizza to order. Bonus points you can get a decent beer to go along with your pizza if you want. 

I ordered the \"Thanks Obama\" by the slice. It was REALLY good. I ate it in like 4 minutes and considered a second one. Having said that I don't think it's quite up to other top end pizza parlours n the city but perhaps one cannot judge properly on one slice alone. I do wish the slices were a little more generous on the toppings. 

I'm being conservative at 3 stars till I can better access their pizzas. . Overall I say it's worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great little local pizza shop with salad buffet and pizza buffet.  A little hard to see from the road but nevertheless well worth a visit. I highly recommend it for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Tried the margherita, mushroom and vegan pizzas. All were very good although a bit pricey. The thin crust is soft, the cheeses and sauces were delicious."}
{"text":"The crust here was better than the Dovercourt location. Crispy and flavourful with nice air pockets.

The mushroom trio ($5/slice) was absolutely delicious. Love the garlic chips, cheese and mushrooms. Nice thin crust. One slice is massive and I got full from it. 
There's free water available which is appreciated."}
{"text":"Quite calm during Tuesday lunch.

Prices already include tax. Magherita is great. A 14\" pizza is quite large and will fill up 2 people. Tomato sauce is tasty, a bit salty. Cheese nice with a pull. Crust was thin and crispy, but it was the most disappointing as it literally had no taste. It was the most bland dough I have ever eaten.

Wanted to try the Mushroom Trio but they didn't have any slices available.

There's complimentary tap water available. 

Maybe not a family spot because the music which was blasting had quite a bit of profanity."}
{"text":"This review is for Village Pizza's Dundas W location.

Some of the best 'za in the city can be found here. The crust is not a true napoletana, but that's ok, they do it their way and it's delicious. The crust seems to be brushed with a small coating of herbs, garlic, and oil turning it the perfect shade of golden brown. 

I would definitely go again, would definitely recommend to others, and would order after a night out!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery..giving the information was painful. The person on the other line had an attitude and had trouble coping the information. I don't think I could have spoken any slower. I was told 35 min. Well 35 turned into 55. That extra 20 is an eternity when you have 3 hungry boys under 6yo. When I called back to see where it was I was again greeted with an attitude. Pleasant..right? Well we got to pizza, and it was cold. NEVER again. I'm going back to Danny's."}
{"text":"They closed down for a while, opened with a new owner for a while, then one of the original owners re-opened it.  The pizza now is just ok.  I have had a meatball sub and stuffed shells and they are both ok."}
{"text":"this is by far my favorite pizzeria since moving here a year ago. It's cheap, it's delicious, and it's all you can eat. They have a variety to choose from and a salad bar. Yum yum yum !!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place quite a few times through Uber Eats and it's been great every time. The buffalo wings are great, you can order pizza by the slice, the philly cheese steak is seasoned very well, and this place has been consistent so far. I have yet to dine in but I will very soon!"}
{"text":"I really like this place and when I do not want to cook, it is the first place I think of for a good and hearty meal.  I only order an 8\" pepperoni pizza or pepperoni calzone which are simplistic but lots of other places including chain restaurants mess them up.  The taste is great every time.  If I could change anything, I would increase the amount of pepperoni used, ensure the crust is always a golden brown color, and not charge for extra sauce.  However, other than that it is perfect.

I will return, and do so often."}
{"text":"Excellent NY style thin pizza! Interesting pizzas - you'll be surprised. They have good wings too. A great alternative to 967 - you know what. Great bunch of people too."}
{"text":"Recently was looking for a place to bring our soccer team to celebrate a great game. Village pizza welcomed us with open arms, set aside some tables and had some delicious food waiting for us! I would highly recommend their buffet, especially the buffalo chicken pizza. 

Great service, great food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious! My first time trying village pizza and the thin crust was phenomenal! They brush the crust with this garlic basil oil thing when the pizza comes out of the oven and it was so flavourful! My new favourite neighbourhood pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Got a slice of the margherita and the jasmine. Basically a textbook example of okay. Especially considering it's 5 bux a slice. Creamy garlic dip wasn't great. Free soda with two slices so that was nice."}
{"text":"I expected something like a cici's pizza buffet, but the quality of the restaurant and food was not even matched to that.

It's a bit pricey for what it is (over $7 for the buffet without a soda). I figured it'd be great for that price, once again compared to cici's; I've tried to steer away from buffets lately. 

The quality of the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. Salad didn't look so fresh, didn't touch that. The seats & tables are quite small and the restaurant itself didn't seem so clean. 

The manager came by around once and asked if everything was okay, so that was nice. 

What disappointed me the most though was that the only dessert offered was a cinnamon glaze over warm thin slices of bread."}
{"text":"I'm glad village is back. After a few ownership changes, the village I ate has returned. The buffet is good. But buffet is buffet. Order a pie and you can have some flavor. The lasagna is tasty. The atmosphere is a family restaurant. If you've been around Tega cay or fort mill sc you can remember when it was one of two choices. Good pizza is finally back just wish they were open Sundays. Need some za for watching football."}
{"text":"Love Village. It's quick & not cheap pizza. Ginny is amazing & accessible! You will not be disappointed in the buffet."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a slice or order in from. Delivery was quick, too. Not always the case with independent places. Nice addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Best pizza in York Co. SO glad the original owners are back. Great food, very reasonable prices, warm and friendly service. Wonderful family restaurant where you can bring the kids for great pizza. Calzones are great. Try the pizza buffet, too. Delish!"}
{"text":"We really like Village Pizza. The servers and owners are such nice people. We almost always get the dinner buffet and it tastes much better than most buffets. We appreciate that the prices are a good value for what you get.  

:-)"}
{"text":"I came here at 11 pm one night and I thought the pizza tasted great. I had their vegan pizza which was mushrooms, grilled veggies, a pesto-like sauce and tomato sauce on a thin crust. I think it was $14 or something like that. I was really hungry so I didn't pay attention to the price.  It also came with an arugula salad and some vegan dressing that tasted like French dressing. 

It was thin crust and the toppings stayed on, which was good (which is an issue when you order vegan pizzas from non-vegan places).  The taste was excellent and I didn't find the pizza too greasy or oily either as some people mentioned. Maybe their pizzas with meat are more greasy????

The only thing is that it is kind of pricey, because I ate an entire 14 inch pizza by myself and was still a bit hungry, so they could add a bit more toppings.

Otherwise, if you're in the area, pretty decent pizza place."}
{"text":"I want to do 4.5 stars but yelp doesn't allow halves. 
I ordered Village Pizza on UberEats and it was absolutely phenomenal! I ordered at 145 am and my food was delivered piping hot and (semi) accurate at 220 am. I would definitely recommend this place to friends. I did 4.5 because I special ordered nacho cheese and it was not with the order :( nonetheless, I'll still order from here again."}
{"text":"What can I say other than the best thin crust pizzas in a causal setting with a great neighbourhood charm to it. I would be here all the time if I lived a little closer!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great crust, toppings, and it is made quite quickly.

Owned by the same people who own the hub I think? Great job!"}
{"text":"I went to the lunch buffet. Never seen a team work harder in a restaurant. So... I'm honestly not sure how to rate them. It's either a 5 or a 3. I'm going with the 5 but let me explain why I would consider knocking 2 points off:

Pros:
- Never seen the staff in a restaurant, let alone a buffet, busting their butts like the gals here. Everyone was attentive.
- The place was basically spotless.
- Was busy but not overcrowded.
- Located in a spot that reasonably easy to get in and out of.
- Locally owned, not a chain.
- They use good cheese. Important on a pizza.
- Slices are a nice size.

Cons:
- Selection. While we were there, they usually had 3 pizzas out at a time. Most of them are split - i.e. half pepperoni, half cheese only; or half supreme, half hawaiian.
- I would have liked to see them offering to customize a slice or two to order.
- Toppings were a bit sparse on most of the pizzas I saw on the buffet.
- Pasta station is clearly an afterthought and doesn't get much love.
- Crust was bland to me. No yeasty flavor or other characteristics.

If you want a simple pizza - i.e. cheese or pepperoni - and a salad, you can't go wrong here. If your pizza preferences don't fall into the standard pre-made pizza categories, you're kind of out of luck.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Rethink the pasta station. There's got to be a better way to hold pasta and sauce. And why hide the breadsticks there?
- Offer to customize 2 slices to a customer's preference.
- Put a stack of plates to the right of the salad bar to improve flow.

So I'm going with a 5 for this review because if I was a mom with teen boys who wanted pizza for lunch, this would have been a homerun. And for a quick stop on your lunch break, it checks all the right boxes."}
{"text":"This is where Jesus gets his pizza. It's heavenly. Big flavours, thin crust and top quality ingredients. A definite last supper."}
{"text":"We enjoy this place, the pizza is top notch and delivery is fast. The spaghetti with meatballs are the best around. Also this is a great place to take the kids and the wait staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in the area! Loved the pizza, pasta buffet. Had been there for the lunch buffet with colleagues and we had a good time. The lunch buffet has enough options for a mere $7.5. The veggie pizza and Cinnamon rolls r the best!"}
{"text":"Originally I was going to De Marcos but they were closed for painting. So I headed across the street to see what else was available and Yelp pulled up this place. Since I was in the mood for a buffet I said \"Why not?\" I had been here years before and it was a sad pathetic business on its last legs. 
But when I came in the door they had bright vibrant colors and the table cloths had glass covers. It's all counter service but they do everything very well.
The pizza was hot fresh and hand tossed. The salad bar was well stocked and it even had chocolate pudding.
I had read several negative reviews about this place but I think those helpers are either snobs or were having a bad day. Not every place is serving gourmet custom flash fired pizza.
This is a great place with a nice setup, hot fresh food at a reasonable price and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST pizza in NYC (Northern York County)! This was our second Supreme and Buffalo pizza carryout pies, and they were just as amazing as the first ones. Don't risk disappointment elsewhere -- just get your pizzas here."}
{"text":"Meh....The buffet was late getting going and the selection was pretty limited. They were very kind and asked what type of pizza we wanted and made it. The crust wasn't my favorite either as it was just a little bland. It's a great deal for the price, but probably not a regular hangout for us."}
{"text":"This pizza is everything I want it to be. It's cheap, it's delicious and I can get it by the slice. I love all four of the pizzas they offer (I was even surprised to like the three cheese pizza even though I typically don't like three cheese). The staff are friendly and the music inside is good but most importantly the pizza tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Poor employees.. Give them some AC! 
It's melting hot (July 29).  Hispanic (?) woman couldn't be more gruff, consider not complaining about stuff (hating working) to strangers/potential customers. We get its hot or not your dream job, Customer service can really be sooo bad these days. Pizza was fine, not amazing, crust burnt. Everyone sweating, Yuck experience."}
{"text":"It was a good pizza. I ordered double pepperoni and double cheese and I can't believe that that's double cheese. If there was half it wouldn't cover the pizza.  It was also pretty salty for a pizza. 
Maybe I'll try again, probably not."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here alot. The owner is there most of the time and she's great. The food is wonderful every time."}
{"text":"My new fave pizza in life is the Mushroom Triad. 
It's the bomb . com. Seriously. 
I shall be back for more!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place gets all the good reviews. We ate here tonight and have to say the service was excellent and the salad bar was a nice addon. After that the pizza was terrible no tast at all. The pasta was ok at best. This was a smaller version of a CiCi's pizza."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, hate the service. I'll start with the pizza - Quality ingredients, awesome thin crust, really hot and delicious. This is the pizza that you order for company and everyone raves about it and talks about it for months afterward. If only their service matched up with the  quality of the pizza! One of those friends that raved about this pizza was trying to pick up a couple pies on the way to our place - he called in advance, ordered two pizzas, then stopped by to pick them up. He was running a little late and in a hurry. He arrived right at the time when they should have been ready, only to be told that they were just starting to \"re-make\" them. Re-make? What? Why? \"Well we forgot to make one pizza, we only made one instead of the two you ordered.\" Ok, well can I just take the one and go then? \"We gave the one away, since we knew you ordered two. So we are just making both now. You can take a walk or whatever, it will be 20 minutes.\" This is an actual conversation that happened and this is INSANE. Totally ridiculous! No apology, no nothing. If it were me, I would have expected both pizzas to be free after that nonsense. Other weirdness - they don't allow half and half pizzas - you can't get one with half pepperoni and half cheese. I've asked numerous times, told them to charge me full price for the more expensive half - they \"just don't do that, it's too complicated\". What? I've also tried to order for delivery only to have them totally screw up my order and take an hour and half to deliver the wrong food - if you want delivery from them, skip them and order Foodora. So anyway, the pizza is great. Expect ridiculous, asinine service."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, the ladies were extremely nice and helpful when I walked in the first time. Great food for an even better price!! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went in there on father's day and ordered a medium pepperoni pizza for 17 dollars.  30 mins later I came back and they told me it would be 10 more minutes.  Came back again and still no pizza.  It became apparant that they had not made the pizza and or had given it away to someone else by accident. I can understand that mistakes happen but they idiot behind the counter gave me attitude when i asked for my money back because he couldnt remember what I ordered or how much to return. So i told him it was the 17 dollar pizza. He just gave me back 17 dollars no taxes and not the garlic sauce we also paid for.  He said he couldnt open the register again. So I stood there asking him if i had to dispute it with the bank and finally he bitchingly took the rest of the money the owed me out of the tip jar - as if I should have to feel badly for taking their tips. What an idiot."}
{"text":"UM???  YUM???

I was seriously surprised by this place.  I ordered two pies for my dad's birthday to split between the two of us.  We ordered a marguerite pizza and a mushroom pizza for delivery.  The delivery was very fast because we live right down the street and the guy was nice.

The pizzas were the bomb.  I seriously was not expecting thin crust goodness with this pesto crust.  I thought about the pizza days later ... and yes, I ate 5 slices...

I will definitely order from here again.  It's my new local joint."}
{"text":"Freshly-made pizza that is oh-so delicious.

If you like pineapple on pizza, be sure to try the \"Thanks, Obama!\". 

At lunch they have about 5 different pizzas on offer. Recently, I had 2 large slices and a soft drink for 10$."}
{"text":"I eat here often. Maybe too often as far as my waistline is considered, but I digress. 
The margherita pizza can't be beat. And I don't know what they do to the crust to make it so magical. Honestly. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. I own a business nearby, and Asher, Jake and Cale have all been so generous with their contributions to our events - they are committed to community involvement and it shows. All around, a great experience and amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here once a week and just love it. They take special requests for pizzas on the buffet. Food is always good and service is also. Definitely recommend for anyone to try this place out."}
{"text":"Cool people, amazing pizza, great music choice, and small space but enough seating for about 15-20 people. 3 cheese with mushroom is a winner in my books. Thin crusts and large slices, water provided, and toppings like a great pizza place should have."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. The food is really great, the buffet is always full with many different choices that look and taste wonderful. The staff is always very helpful and so nice. They offer a full menu as well as a buffet. The calzones are amazing. I'm not sure how anyone can complain about anything from here as I have always had a great experience."}
{"text":"Great quick stop for good food. Kids are from the buffet for 3.50 each. One adult Stromboli and 1 calzone. Hit the spot. Friendly, helpful service. We'll be back"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff who provides great service, delicious foods made with fresh ingredients, wide variety of menu items, very happy they opened so close to my house, will be returning and recommending to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Edited/Updated  4/3/2013

Well, Ginny, the old owner, has come back after all this time. Everything is exactly as I remember and it is absolutely FANTASTIC to have it back.  Great pizza, kick ass salad bar, and the calzones are out of this world. I now go at least once a week. Very family friendly place too. Thank you, Village Pizza!


My one-star Review from 3/10/2010:

I have been eating at Village Pizza for over 15 years now. The previous owner knew how to run this joint. Fresh, hot pizza, good service, good value. I used to eat here at least once a week.

Unfortunately, this is not the case now. The long-time owner has sold the restaurant to someone who honestly doesn't seem to give a damn. The pizza is cold on the buffet, the salad is old, the service is awful and the price for a lunch buffet got higher and higher as the quality diminished. 

I have not been back to Village Pizza in over 6 months now, don't plan on returning unless the previous owner decides to come back. 

I would say avoid this place."}
{"text":"Tasty New-york style pizza thin crust pizza. Affordable. The \"Thanks Obama\" is really good. Hawaiian with spam and BBQ sauce. Staff super chill. They have chilled wine and beer."}
{"text":"This pizza is very greasy! Flavour was decent and I liked the thin crust, but wow, the top of the pizza was slick. Decent price point - about $30 for a 14'' margherita and two beers (tall cans). Pizza was six slices and reasonable to share between two people unless you were super hungry."}
{"text":"Literally the best calzone I've had. I got one with cheese, beef, and jalapeños. The ingredients were spot on! The cheese was different than what I've had in other calzone. Too bad I'm on diet now, can't eat here for a while :/"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my son and had pizza buffet. Great service. Great buffet. Great price and clean. Highly recommend and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ever since coming back from a very memorable experience in New York with my girlfriends, there's been one thing I've missed beyond all others (with very mixed emotions, no less, due to a botched food delivery leaving me quite shlangry... sleepy hungry hangry...is that a thing?). I came to Village Pizza with a friend on our lunch break and got a slice.

The mushroom trio and the obama are mind blowing! I'm not typically a fan of blue cheese or strong-tasting cheese but it really works with the mushroom. The sweet and savoury of the twist on the Hawaiian, the obama worked surprisingly well, especially with that BBQ drizzle. I was folding up this slice as they did in New York and was immediately brought back to the memories of that trip. The charred thin crust, the simplicity of it, the pull of the cheese, the juices dripping out of the back of the fold. This may very well become a regular thing."}
{"text":"The great folks who own the Hub café up the street on Dovercourt have a great new pizza place! I had the mushroom pizza pie, served on a bed of super thin crust. Delicious! There were hints of at least two cheeses and a nice variety of mushrooms. They have a bunch of other kinds including the classic Margherita and some fun ones like the Thanks Obama! with pineapple and spam. Not to mention a selection of craft beer and sodas. I will be back to try them all out."}
{"text":"Great Slice! Had the Hawaiian - the spam makes it. No really. It does.  Perfect crust. And the garlic butter thing on the outside is terrific. 5$ is a very fair price. The bbq sauce may be a bit too much sweet - it's sweet enough with the pineapple.  Thin but not too thin crust, I'll be back to try the mushroom. Super good. VERY hot inside. Great addition to the neighbourhood. Try the slices if you're wary of the price."}
{"text":"Vegan pizza slice
The middle of the pizza loads with bunch of veggies. The edge is crispy a little bit dry. 
Like the sauce a lot!"}
{"text":"I'm also just leaving a review for Taco Tuesday! As another person mentioned, there aren't a lot of good authentic tacos spots in Madison, but this place truly hit the spot! What a lucky find, especially since it's so close to my house :) I got one of each kind that they had that night - carne asada, chicken, and carnitas. All three were delicious and the hot sauces were wonderful as well! Be careful though, the hot one really isn't a joke! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We we received a delivery (ordered by friends) from here after our second child was born. Can't believe we've lived around the corner from this place for 3 years and didn't know about it. Food was excellent! We had the chicken and eggplant parmigiana and couple of side salads. Highly recommend! Can't wait to order from here again!"}
{"text":"I have heard making pizza is an art. And village pizza has made it to perfection. The crispy crust,  perfect balance of cheese and toppings. We ordered the chicken pizza 14 inch and it was enough for 2 people. 
There is a vegan option too"}
{"text":"I love pizza and I went to Dovercourt Village Pizza Company for lunch today.

Slices are $5 ... today you could get two slices and a pop for $10.  Though it was a bit burnt and charred on the bottom, it was a good slice of classic pepperoni pizza.  It was thin crust and soft and floppy, which I like.  The outer crust was crunchy.

The guys working behind the counter making pizza and serving were friendly.

It was really really hot in the restaurant ... pizza ovens along with a heat wave aren't a good combo.  I imagine it will be more comfortable once the cooler weather comes."}
{"text":"So far I've had slices of the 'Thanks, Obama!' (grilled Spam and pineapple) and the Margherita. The Thanks, Obama! was my favourite - thin and nicely charred crust, delicious toppings. The Margherita was just ok, it could have used a lot more basil. Hoping to try the mushroom, but it hasn't been available by the slice the times I've been. Pricey."}
{"text":"Great unique pizza options here. We had the 'Thanks Obama' pizza. Made fresh to our order, the staff was super friendly. You will sweat here, if you want AC, get it to go."}
{"text":"Very good pizza...stumbled across this place when I was heading to a dance class. I was craving pizza and yelp recommended this place for us. They did not disappoint. The pizzas are excellent! The medium pizza is pretty big and can provide about 6 very large slices. It was also fun to watch them create the pies and how they proof the dough. A great place if you are craving pizza!!!"}
{"text":"My son loves this place and very convenient since we're so close.  It's very clean, servers are prompt especially for it being mostly a buffet, pizza is decent, and the salad bar is YUM. I think the pizza could be tweaked a bit but honestly for the price, you can't complain."}
{"text":"I'm still searching for a good..really good (ok great) pizza in the Ft Mill /Tega Cay SC  area. I decided to try Village Pizza and after trying their Supreme Pizza....I'm still searching. It is a pizza and it is ok....but it's not great. The sauce is the culprit. Too sweet. I can see this being a good place.for families with children or those looking for an average pizza experience."}
{"text":"I tried Village Pizza the other day. Got a slice of cheese pizza for ~$3. I didn't see slices on the menu but I asked and she said they could do it. It was a big slice, similar in size to Ian's. The crust wasn't as crispy as Ian's but it worked. The pizza and value were great. Definitely 5 star. The reasons I gave it a 4 star were because: 1. Didn't see slices on the menu. Don't know if I can go back and order a slice or it was a one-time off-the-menu exception (I would go back for one). 2. The wait was a little too long. 3. It was too dark inside. (Tons of seating, though.)"}
{"text":"Great place for the quick and easy pizza joint. Everyone is super nice too. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for the \"1 year anniversary party\" and had a really great time with my friends, They had a $5 special on beer which was amazing. My friends and I ended up trying two pizzas and they were both fantastic, But at $15 bucks for a small sized SUPER SUPER GREASY / Fall apart pizza...You might wanna pass

Don't get me wrong they were awesome and really tasty but you don't get much pizza for $15 and the toppings slide right off and into the box. Still, If your willing to drop the coin for some small size pizza's with greasy sliding toppings then go crazy.

My friends and I were having a blast at the anniversary but then we saw what must have been a days old baby wearing no noise protection head gear. Yes a days to week old baby was being carried around the establishment while a DJ played loud music(too loud for a baby) as alcohol was served to people. That's cool if your a parent and you just want to make an appearance but they stuck around almost the whole night. There were other different aged children with hockey sticks walking around and..well...I saw what I saw and I didn't feel comfortable being around so many children while a DJ is playing music and alcohol being served. Call me a grouch, call me a lame ass but someone should have said / done something. I'm no expert on babies but even at Blue Jays games I see parents holding kids with ear protective headsets on, And that's at a BASEBALL GAME!. It was sketchy and uncomfortable and unforgettable. Way too hot inside the building too.

Note: 
-Pizza was awesome
-Establishment was very clean 
-Staff was very friendly
-Location is great
-HOT AS HELL INSIDE! 
-Babies are awesome...Just not at bars....and when they are just days old... with DJ's playing...and alcohol being served....I hope this was just a one off night with kids."}
{"text":"Trust this crust. Thanks Obama in all its salty spam-my goodness takes me back to childhood but I have hypocritically loved many slices of arugula-lated Hungary Vegan and Queen Margherita too. They are all worthy. 
Countertop chili oil (jar on counter) jacks the flavour without being too fiery. The beet and caesar salads are fresh, shareable, and help justify impending pizza binge, but I usually just get more pizza. 
If/when I get carried away, a shot (you can sip it too) of Fernet is the ultimate digestivo solution. 
The staff are lovely, beer is local, the decor is charming, the math is easy ($5 beer, 5$ slice) and the pizza is perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Would be willing to burn the roof of my mouth and extinguish it with cherry soda with this slice everyday. I recommend their rendition of Hawaiian which involves BBQ sauce drizzle and spam in place of ham. Their mushroom with gorgonzola is also a killer choice. Their crust is thin, well seasoned, and consistently has a nice ripple of char on the underside. Folks are super nice, place is clean and hipster-ish with good taste in music."}
{"text":"I'm cycling home on my usual route up Dovercourt north of Bloor and I notice people sitting in a space that has been in transition for a few years - coffee shop, take out but never really taking flight. I also notice the sign Dovercourt Village Pizza! I'd been wondering what to do for dinner...the thinking was over. I turned around and locked up. The setting is simple and informal with long tables and a combination of benches and chairs. The menu also simple with 18\" or 14\" whole pies or large slices for $5, a few salads, 5 local brews, a couple of \"booze\" choices and a house red & white. I ordered two slices: Thanks Obama and the vegan both delicious along with the kale Caesar and a tall boy oatmeal stout also $5. The food delicious, vibe easy and location filling a gap."}
{"text":"Great place to take anyone especially kids um and also delivery is incredible highly recommended"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was overpriced and not good.  Tasteless pizza, with watery salad.  I hate Cicis, but I am afraid Cici makes better pizzas..."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good pizza. I'd liken this to a New York-style pie with a *slightly* thicker/flakier/less crispy crust. The cheese here is perfect -- the right amount, cooked properly, with a nice pull. Pepperoni has great porkiness, too.

My only complaint is I don't like the herb/oil rubbed crust. It tastes like cheap infused olive oil. Luckily it's only brushed on the edge and not all over. Maybe I should just ask them to leave it off next time.

Super friendly service and speedy delivery."}
{"text":"Thanks Obama? NAH, THANK YOU VILLAGE PIZZA!

The much-lauded much-Yelped-about 'Thanks Obama' pizza is all I've eaten from Village Pizza, save for some stray cheesy garlic bread slices. Essentially a riff on a Hawaiian pie, the BBQed SPAM was amazing, the pineapple perfectly proportioned and the BBQ sauce an awesome complement.

Because I'm a savage and NEED TA DIP I also got a garlic-style dipping sauce that was awesome. Really salty - I woke up in the night and downed two pints of water - but awesome.

Yelp note: if I had any complaint it would be that it wasn't quite *big* enough. I definitely could have eaten more and left hungry, which rarely happens when I polish off a whole pizza solo."}
{"text":"Never thought spam on a pizza would be so amazing. It's like a little grilled soft hotdog slices and giant amazing chunks of pineapple !! I wish we got two pizzas one to eat and one to cuddle with !!!  It was so freaking amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered for take-out.  Was pleasantly greeted on the phone and my order was taken down promptly.  When I showed up, the restaurant was pretty quiet and I was able to pay for my food and go in about three minutes.  I payed $10.45 for a large cheese pizza.  The pizza was nice and hot, but was mediocre in taste.    I ended up having to jazz it up at home with some basil, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder.

There was a sign outside advertising the lunch buffet for $6.99, but I don't know that it's worth the money.  I can tell you that based on my the pizza I ate, I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC service, delicious pizza  & calzones!!' Delightful staff & hometown atmospheric. 

I had the first calzone I'd ever eaten in my life at Village pizza and it has ruined me for life. I've only tasted one other place that even comes close to measuring up to their calzones. I've known the o owner for over 30 years and they always put out quality food ."}
{"text":"I don't think I can get enough of this place (Dovercourt).  I'm a set fan of their Three Mushroom Pizza, with white Gorgonzola sauce.  Because I might feel the desire to order a whole pizza, perhaps just for myself, the total ends up being double what it normally is for my pizza... budget.  
The place is hip, the crust is thin, the taste is yum.  There was a recent auction, that featured this place.  I fought hard to win the prize, but lost out at the last minute.  Village Pizza is so on my mind lately."}
{"text":"This pizza is the bomb! The only reason I'm am giving it a 4 is because of the certain death journey to the bathroom. It's not really their fault because they share it with the place next door. 
We had the mushroom pizza and steamwhistle. It was so good. The crust the toppings ....the crust. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I thought the concept of a buffet was to serve food. No pizza for 20 minutes from 12:00pm until 12:20pm. Staff was less than friendly. When the pizza finally came out is was good, but the wait was too long."}
{"text":"Village Pizza is located at Dovercourt/Bloor and is one of my favourite pizza places to grab a slice or a whole pie. The pizzeria conveys a relaxed, chill vibe and the staff are friendly. I've tried the \"Thanks Obama\" pizza as well as the pepperoni. Both were excellent and delicious. The crust is not too crunchy but has the right texture you are looking for in that perfect slice of pizza. Will definitely be returning for more in the future."}
{"text":"I don't think I could tell the difference between the pizza from here or Domino's.  That being said, its cheap, quick, friendly and the local competition is slim.  I will probably take out from here again out of convenience but most of the time I will venture out of Fort Mill to get the good stuff."}
{"text":"Lovely staff, clean place, nice vibe.
Pizza was just horrible.I've had better at Chucky Cheese. 
Spaghetti was average, it would have a hard time beating the stuff out of a can.
Probably an awesome place for kids or the elderly, a clientele more likely to enjoy bland under salted food with no seasoning, and all the bright colors. 
Again,  very friendly staff. 
Only gave 3 stars for how awesome they are."}
