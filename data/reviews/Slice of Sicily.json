{"text":"The food is great here!  From fried zucchini to pizza to chicken parmesan, you can't go wrong.  Their homemade garlic Italian salad dressing is nothing short of amazing.  The only cons here is the service is often slow and can be a little mouthy.  We've seen people walk out before ordering because of it.  Bring in your favorite bottle of wine and they'll provide the glasses."}
{"text":"Slice of Sicily is hands down our favorite pizza joint in Phoenix. The pizza is really, really delicious. We pretty much always get the combo (pepperoni, sausage, peppers, mushrooms, onions, olives) and we are always very very happy. It is perfect Friday night with Netflix food.   Lovely people own the place, too."}
{"text":"Mariah is a super friendly delivery driver and Donna is an absolute treat to talk to on the phone. I love this place! Over the few times I've gotten delivery, I have tried the Tortellini Alfredo (which is insanely good), the garlic knots and white pizza. I will definitely continue ordering from Slice of Sicily."}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza. I got slices to go which is so convenient! This is def my new fave pizza place."}
{"text":"try it you will like it, and Donna is a hoot plus provides great service. ate lunch regularly there when i worked on 44th street."}
{"text":"ok try the white pizza....amazing..never had it before but yum..the taste is fab....i always thought white pizza yuck..wrong..yummmy..one bite and you are hooked..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful pizza here last night.  My toppings included black olives, mushrooms and artichokes.  My boyfriend enjoyed the baked ziti.   We have been driving past this place forever and always want to stop in. Last night when we were decided what to do for dinner I said, let's have pizza and let's look on Yelp for a recommendation.  We decided that Slice of Sicily would be our choice based on closeness to our apartment and the good reviews it received.      We drive up and get a spot right in front!  Hooray for good luck!  There were only two people eating inside so we picked out a table and took a seat.  The tables were all red and white checkered and the walls full of Italian maps and posters.  The west wall was an interesting mural of an Italian landscape with bare trees and sunflowers.  The decor reminded me of how much I missed Italy.   We took a look at the menu, ordered and looked on the huge map of Italy next to us.  I asked Gary if he knew where I was born... he knew it was up north.  So I showed him, I also showed him the placed I lived in Italy and the place we are going to retire too.  He always laughs when I say that.  He doesn't know how serious I am!  Our waitress was nice and between her and the owner we got everything we needed.  The owner's family is from Sicily, but her mother was born in the states.    Our food was fantastic.  I no longer need to drive all the way to NYPD for New York Style Pizza, I can drive up the street to Slice of Sicily.  There was a nice steady stream of people in and out of the restaurant.  They do many to go orders.  They had many regulars.  We will definitely be regulars.   I would have given this place 5 stars but when we ordered two canolli's they went back to grab them and came out empty  handed.  They unfortunately were out of canolli batter.  We were a little disappointed but said we'd be back for more pizza and canolli another time.  I definitely recommend this restaurant if you like family owned pizza places and great New York style pizza.   I hope this review is beyond satisfactory to those who take this site way way way too seriously.  I tried to write a few more paragraphs, but there wasn't anything left for me to cover."}
{"text":"talk about a place that puts the love into their food and cares about their customers, this is the spot."}
{"text":"This place really is a hole-in-the-wall joint. I go with a friend from Brooklyn, NY.  He loves the Calzones.  I figure you can't go wrong with a Pizza joint that a Brooklynite loves.   Three things to remember about Slice of Sicily:  Hole in the wall.  Wise-ass service.   Try the Pizza wrap!"}
{"text":"The hostess/lady who took my order was very polite and created brief and pleasant small talk. I ordered 2 cheese slices to go and my food was given to me within 5 minutes. The price was reasonable. The pizza was in my opinion slightly above average. The restaurant itself wasn't the most charming and the location wasn't the greatest but not the worst either. But for quick take out it was ok. Giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and 2 slice lunch special. I've definitely had better around PHX but not by much."}
{"text":"I have to tell you when I think of Italian food I think of Slice of Sicily. Two of my favorites are the baked ziti and the manicotti. I like to visit here at least two times a month. Donna the owner never meets a stranger and makes sure your needs are met while you are there. You may want to try the garlic twists they are delicious but they go out the door fast."}
{"text":"The food is great, and the staff is very friendly. I particularly prefer real NY style pizza, so there are only a couple pizzerias I go to that I consider to fall into that category. Slice of Sicily is definitely top notch."}
{"text":"Honestly I'd have to give the place 4 1/2 stars if it were an option. The pizza borders of great, but not quite there. Still, you's have to drive a good distance and pay a lot more for better. This place is our favorite neighborhood pizzaria hands down. Amazing that the chains like Dominoe's can even survive in our neighborhood with Slice of Sicily here. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Slice of Sicily? It's amazing, that's what I can say. Anytime you find a pizza joint that also serves real Italian dinners, and the owners actually operate the place, you are in for great food! They are capable of making a truly mean New York style pie. I typically like sausage on my pizza, but their seasoned hamburger has replaced it as my topping of choice. Suffice to say, I have forsaken pizza chains due to the superb quality of the food at Slice of Sicily."}
{"text":"The Food is so good here. we always get take out and it has become a ritual at least once or twice a month. So  we had to host and feed about 22 people after a local swim meet and there were a lot of teenagers to feed. We couldn't cook for that many so we called around to pick something up.  I called three other places for lasagna and Slice of Sicily came through with price and the right size pan of lasagna for 22 people. We had never had it before. We always get their pizza. So I did not know what to expect. The lasagna went over very well. Absolutely homemade and delicious. We had thought about the Costco option but never really liked their pre-packaged lasagna so we took the chance on Slice of Sicily. I reheated it as per instructions and it was fantastic. Truly...this is as good as it gets. The place/location isn't fancy and the  could easily be featured on diners,, drive-ins and dives...but who cares. The food is fantastic and the people..Donna and her husband are sincere and down to earth. I recommend you try it."}
{"text":"UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP!!  I WAS a regular here until today.  Was very surprised to find that they had sold their business.  The new owner came to our table and let us know he had just bought the place and had a very limited menu.  The thing he didn't tell us was among the things he was out of, were TASTE and QUALITY.  The slices that did come out where about 60% of the size they were under the old management.  The crust was chewy and undercooked, cheese was bland, the toppings seemed more like a garnish, and the sauce tasted like something you would find at the dollar store marked \"Pizza Flavored Sauce.\"   I also received only one of the two toppings I had ordered, and the party next to me, who ordered several pizzas to go, were missing toppings off their pizzas as well.  They didn't even have any diet soda or iced tea, so the \"sugar challenged\" had to drink water. I understand that that he is a new owner, but he would have been better served to close the place for a few days while he got his footing, than to serve sub-par food to regular customers, who will not return."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in town.  Always great and entertaining service from Donna who has the ability to remember a customers preferences time and time again. The chicken dishes are all very good but the pizza dough and calzones are truly the best you can find West of New York.  I can't justify going to another Italian restaurant in town because of the quality of the food. Also - as it is a BYOB, you save a little money on drinks.  Simply the best of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Started the weekend off right with white pizza and Caesar salad delivered from Slice of Sicily.  We love to order the biggest size because any leftovers slices can be frozen....the slices are HUGE!  Then we just reheat the frozen slices when the mood hits us! Of course it means we do not get to see Donna and Bill in person, but get to catch up and talk Cardinals by phone."}
{"text":"Another adventure into the place of pizza deliciousness with a dose of sarcasm thrown in for good measure. Arriving 6 minutes before opening we, wife Earlene,son Wayne and I, peeking through the glassed front door, were greeted with with the steely stare of our hostess and dear friend Donna. Glaring she pointed her finger at her watch indicating our arrival was way too soon before opening. Oops. Condescending, Donna opened the door and with the usual greetings with hugs we proceeded onward. It's been over a year since we last visited Slice of Cicely as Earlene and I were visiting son Wayne. As usual the pizzas were outstanding as Bill's culinary expertise has not waned since the last time we experienced his creations. We love these people, and was certainly not dis appointed. If looking for a delightful time eating scrumptious pizza in an atmosphere of friendliness with a hint of cynicism, you cannot find a better establishment. An added bonus was seeing Donna's mom Ann and other family members as well. Thanks Donna and Bill for another  wonderful time and eating a great meal.  You're the best.    Why a 4 instead of a 5?  No beer; one can BYOB but I prefer to buy on premises, maybe someday!"}
{"text":"Slice of Sicily is our new lunch place! It's perfect for a work break and they have a $5.70 lunch which includes a slice of pizza, a drink, and a salad - not too shabby, if I do say so myself!   I would not go there if I was: 1.  On a first date 2.  Wanting something healthy 3.  Hoping for great service (the lunch menu is on a chalkboard on the wall ... and if you ask for the lunch specials, they ask you to get up and look at the chalkboard) 4.  Lookin' to impress (unless you were impressing with your local knowledge....)  The pizza was great for a hole in the wall place, and it's definitely family owned!  We'll definitely keep going - mostly for convenience and value..."}
{"text":"Wow, I am surprised by all the great reviews for this place.  I pulled in on my way home because it was on the way, they had slices, and I was starving. I ordered 2 slices with two toppings, and I was told it would be a few minutes. No problem Extra was on TV, so I sat down to watch...bonus. The lady in there was nice, and service was fine.  Well, not too long after my slices came out, and I paid like $6 which made me think I should have gone to Mama Mia's a few blocks down where slices were cheaper and included a drink, but I decided to try something new.  New is not always better unfortunately. I opened the pizza in the car so I could eat a slice as I was driving. I know gross and unsafe, I was really starving and I had been at work till 7 PM.   Anyway, the pizza was gross. The toppings were just all sitting on top and not melted into the cheese at all. They kept falling off the pizza. The rest of it was heinous. The crust, the cheese, and the sauce did nothing for me.   I've been to a lot of places that had better pizza, and I plan on going to one of those places next time I need my pizza fix. I am pretty sure if I went to Sicily it would not taste like this pizza."}
{"text":"More of a 2.5 but I'll give it three because the owner was nice. She clearly knew almost everyone coming in and out of the place and had lots of repeat customers.   The place is dank and the plastic red table cloths are sticky. The mural is very cheesy and now well-painted. The owner is nice but I have smelled few people who emanate the smell of cigarettes more strongly. It is awful and it made us feel a bit sad/depressed for her. It made the place seem gloomier. And it is NOT appetizing.   The cheese sticks were ok and the sauce served with them was passable. The pizza was sort of ehhhh...The cheese quality was a bit low and the sauce just didn't work that well as a pizza sauce. Crust was cooked well and had a bit of crisp on the bottom.   I would not come back here. It was middling at best and a bit depressing."}
{"text":"I knew when I called Slice of Sicily for closing time (8pm for dine in, 9pm for carryout, closed on Sundays) this is where I wanted dinner.  When I asked for information a somewhat ear piercing, tone varied voice loudly gave me answers.  This was the real deal New York style pizza joint I was craving.  We arrived for a family dinner night about 7:20.  A few people were watching Dancing with the Stars while waiting for their to go.  Trying to transform a four top into a five top, a skinny, grey-haired  woman shuffled over to assist.  This was Donna, my new favorite Phoenix waitress.  We get seated, open the beers I brought (BYOB) and start ordering.  We shared some fried mushrooms and zucchini.  Decent but nothing special.  Pizza wise we got a meat lovers, veggie and white.  All three were great!  Fresh toppings, thin, crispy crust and cheesed to perfection.  Take note of the wall mural.  The farm house scene is very entertaining.  I had a small obsession with real wreath added on the painted door.    Donna definitely enhanced my visit.  She was sassy towards my bro-in-law considering he was outnumbered by the women surrounding him.  I liked that and so did he.  She gives it to ya straight.  Donna and my Mom hit it off.  I hope they become friends."}
{"text":"All the times I've been here and never written a review? Well, this is long overdue. I've always loved their real NY-style pies. And since Belfiore's closed it is, without a doubt,  my go-to for the real deal. They keep it traditional (other than pineapple) with toppings like mushrooms, olives, etc.  In addition to the pizza, they make calzones that are equally awesome. Not to be overlooked is the house made Italian dressing on a good, crisp, salad as well as a host of classic Italian-American dishes, like ravioli, masala, and (I love the) meatballs.  Donna is the hostess with the mostest, and she keeps it fun and often funny. Bill is a stand-up guy who keeps the kitchen humming. Say hi to him if you see him step out of the back. This is not your nouvelle cuisine, over-the-top $70 for two carrots and a slice of carpaccio. \"Slice\" is a neighborhood place where they serve very good, made with care, comfort food. There are plastic tablecloths, and its casual. Come a few times and they'll know your name. And bring your appetite, bring a sense of fun, and if you drink, bring your own wine. Let me just say that despite the distance, I drive here at least monthly for a fix."}
{"text":"Somebody call the Health department ASAP. First off, the address to this dump is wrong on three different websites, which is why it took me nearly an hour and two phone calls to find the place. It is located in a very shady area right where an army of about 20 homeless folks had gathered. The store sign is a bedsheet and the parking lot in the back appears to be a place you could easily get jacked.     As I entered the place to retrieve my pie, nobody appeared at the counter. I peaked into the kitchen and the old gravely voiced lady was fully lit up with her cigarette spewing smoke RIGHT THERE IN THE KITCHEN, while her hubby was slinging pizzas next to her. It was a disgusting lack of respect for people who eat there and have no idea what goes on in the kitchen. Many people have complained about the cigarette smoke, but now it is time to shut this place down. Nasty behavior by people who should not be making food for others to eat. I'm glad I witnessed this and it saved me $15 and likely sickness too."}
{"text":"My buddy and I have gone there a few times now for the lunch special and the pizza is amazing. It's New York style. The crust is amazing, not sure how to describe the taste but maybe all that matters is that it actually has some taste to it. Love the sauce, the meats and all. The last time I got it well-done and I couldn't stop making this-food-is-amazing sounds. And it's family-owned - 'nuf said."}
{"text":"not open at 8pm on a wednesday... no website.  dud for me :/ maybe ill get a chance to try it when it's actually open"}
{"text":"CLOSED. One of the best NY pizza places is gone with the wind. Restaurant is closed now."}
{"text":"One of the best white pizzas I have ever had! I can't believe I waited so long to try this place out! I love the owners! So nice and funny. They hung out with us at our table and shot the shit for awhile. I've been meaning to go back but my only grip about this place is their hours. I usually don't get home from work in time to get here before closing! But I will have to make time and go back soon for this awesome local restaurant."}
{"text":"I will give S.o.S. a 4 star rating for now for two reasons. I have only tried two items from their menu. The pizza and the cheese calzone. Definitely a solid pizza and an awesome calzone. The only downside is that it is a little bit small and fills up quick. It's not a problem if you're doing carry out but if you're on your lunch break and want to sit down and enjoy your meal it can be difficult at times. They have great lunch specials and all the typical dishes that you will find at a basic Italian joint. Although I can't say for sure, if they make their dishes like their pizzas and zone's, I'm willing to bet they will be pretty solid. I guess I will have to go back pretty soon and try on for myself!"}
{"text":"There is one simple reason to go to Slice of Sicily besides the fact that the pizza is better than Mamma Mia's: the waitress is awesome.  A brassy skinned, raspy voiced spitfire of a straight-shit-bitch server will unhappily take your order, and bring it to your promptly.  You'll listen to her answer the phone with a sound that is a medley of Kathleen Turner, Diane Rehm with a touch of one of those women with a hole in their throat from smoking.    \"GOOD AFTERNOON SLICE OF SICILY\"  It's comical in the best way, and I both admire and respect this woman for running the tiny, four topped gem seemingly on her own and without regard for the comfort of her customers.  She is, in my eyes, sort of a bad ass.   Also, the pizza is not bad, the prices are fair, the salads taste fresh and the place is bright and welcoming with comfy hotel room art and a steady flow of people getting their orders to-go (perhaps to avoid my hero server).  I pay attention to the service, I do, and while normally I might scoff at her unpleasant attitude and smoker's voice, for some reason I find her, and this place, a fascinating destination for a cheap pizza lunch and an interesting experience."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix!! This obscure family-owned restaurant makes the some of the best pizza that I've ever had. The crust isn't thin nor is it super thick-- it's between the too. The ambiance is casual and co-owner/wife Donna keeps the customers hydrated and engaged in the front portion of the restaurant while her husband prepares each meal individually in the kitchen. This hidden gem is located behind Bosa donuts. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and abusive service. Best of NY. Woo Hoo."}
{"text":"So, I try to visit local restaurants/food places.  I stopped by this evening.  First there were only a few people .. .and the one that took my order was eating and it was an effort for her to get up and take my order.  They were out of Alfredo sauce with no apologizes, not even some sort of suggestion.. and again did I say, no apologizes?   So I order the Manicotti.. was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I returned, and a young lady was leaning against the counter.. saw me walk in and continued to text.  I finally had to say that I was there for a pick up.   They handed me the bag... a thin one that you could feel the unbearable to touch heat right through the bag.  Could they at least have double bagged it?  That would've been customer service.... and the bread was in a brown bag.  By the time I returned home, only a few blocks away, the bread was soggy in grease.   I have lived in NYC....great friends that are Italians...and trust me they would not have stood for this.. and like me will never return again."}
{"text":"I pass this place everyday on my way home from work and finally decided to stop and try it out.  I walked in and stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before anyone even talked to me.  A lady kept coming in and out of the kitchen but never even looked at me. The place was basically empty, only 2 tables had people sitting.  Finally she asked if I needed something.  Sure, I would like 2 slices with sausage to go please.  She said she would have to check if they had any and walked into the back.  I was confused because they didn't close for another 4 hours.  You're a pizza place, how could you be out of pizza? She came back and said I was lucky, they had 2 slices left and would have them ready in about 5 minutes.  Ok, I paid and took a seat.    The table next to me just had a pizza brought out and it got me excited!! It looked GREAT!!  It looked so good, I was debating eating the pizza there instead of waiting till I got a mile down the street to my house.    While sitting there waiting I started to look around at the place and couldn't help but notice how old and dirty the place looked.  This place looks like it hasn't had a coat of paint in over 20 years!!  The amount of cluster behind the counter and dirt stained counter got me wondering.  If the front of the restaurant, what customers can see, looks like this how bad is the back of the restaurant where we can't see??    After about 10 minutes I was wondering if my pizza was ever going to be ready.  I asked the lady and she went to check.  Came back out and said a few more minutes.  Did I get lucky and they made a fresh pizza? Is that why 5 minutes turned into close to 15 minutes before my slices came out? NOPE!!!  I got home and quickly opened my box to find 2 burnt slices of what looked like 2 day old pizza.  The crust was completely burned to the point that when I tried to bend the crust it crumbled.  The sausage was just placed on top of the pizza and was cold?  The pizza was hot/burned but the sausage was cold.  I pulled the sausage off and took a bite and was quickly disappointed :(  It tasted just like it looked.  Old burnt pizza.  How did my slices look like this but the table next to me while I was waiting had me salivating at the mouth with how good the pizza looked?  Why would they even package this for a customer? I ended up throwing the pizza in the trash and made a sandwich.    I should have walked out as soon as she said she had to see if they had any slices left.  I still can't understand how they could look at those burned slices and still put them into a box for a customer.  Never again.  The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1 is because the other pizza I saw while waiting for mine to be ready looked so good.  If they don't care about serving me a decent slice then I won't waste my time or money on them.  Sucks because I live right up the street."}
{"text":"I loved the pizza. My partner and I went to eat there and it was very good. The owner was a very nice lady also. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome ! Call me Boring but I absolutely love their plain cheese pizza extra crispy!! Delicious !'"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous!! Pizza had mysterious meat with craft cheese and the dough.. my goodness. It was not done properly. Shady atmosphere with shady service. Needs a lot of improvement on everything."}
{"text":"A must if you love east coast pizza this is the best I've  had  here. Donna jean is a hoot she will make you smile . so order a large pepperoni and enjoy"}
{"text":"A little disappointed  I was very excited to try a \"Slice of Sicily\" based on all the positive reviews that I have read. The restaurant is clean and the staff is warm and welcoming. However, when I first walked in and sat at a table there was this overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke and the pizza was a little disappointing.  On this visit we ordered the 2 slice one topping pizza with drink lunch deal. The slices of pizza at Slice of Sicily are large and the toppings are plentiful however the pizza itself just wasn't very good.  I don't know, maybe I was expecting too much but in my opinion,  the pizza was just average at best. There are other pizza restaurants in the area that I would prefer to go to.  To end on a positive note, the service at Slice of Sicily was excellent however,  I could not get over the strong smell of cigarette smoke that lingers throughout the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"They have the best eggplant ever!!! They really care about the food it's a little place you would never guess. I've never had anything bad here!"}
{"text":"I was working in Phoenix for a month and really wish I had found this place sooner. By far the best pizza I have had in a really long time. Good prices, relaxed atmosphere and good food. What more could you ask for. The owners made sure to greet us and came out to the table to check on everything. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the Phoenix area looking for some great NY style pizza!"}
{"text":"Was looking for some pizza while in Phoenix for business. I stumbled on this little place an wow!! The service, atmosphere, and food were excellent !!"}
{"text":"Excellent white pizza!  Try it with sausage, roma tomatoes, basil, and olives."}
{"text":"Bad attitudes from the workers, the food is not that great to put up with the mood of this place. This isn't like the soup Nazi from Seinfeld. Sometimes the place is open and sometimes it is not which makes for crappy business."}
{"text":"Food tasted as good as stuff from back east. Owner and server Dona seems to have an attitude but its a sweetheart and serves great food. Best pizza we've had in a long time I definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Ambient - Casual  Service - The waitress/ cashier/ owner is very attentive and considerate.  Treats you like family.  Food - Its good.  Although I'm not sure if they are cooking everything from their frozen state... I once had their chicken parmasean and it tasted that way.  I've also had their spaghetti and ravioli, I enjoy their sauce."}
{"text":"We prefer Pizza A Metro now. Tastes great and catches you way off guard. But we'll return on occasion to Slice of Sicily. They still have a fun place and solid food. They know our neighborhood, too, so if you want to keep it local, keep going to Slice of Sicily."}
{"text":"At first I was really taken aback by the poor phone etiquette but as I have adjusted I realize that a nice chunk of Phoenix has poorer customer service than I am used to. That's just the way it is. So I let it go.  The pizza is the best and it's a pity they don't deliver. The crust is amazing. So amazing I actually eat it, and the sauce has the clearest taste. Outstanding really. This little spot should be voted best over Mamma Mia but I don't know why it hasn't.  I've never ate in but the pizza is always ready on time and I enjoy the hostess/waitress a lot in person. She's a firecracker."}
{"text":"I got the white pizza...sooooo good...fresh garlic with Olive oil!  Definitely will be trying more from them.  Parking is in the back of building and there are picnic tables if you want to sit and eat outside."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly! A close walk from VA. Check it out, it's a mom and pop place!"}
{"text":"Quality NY slice of pie. Had the pepperoni and it did not disappoint at all. This is a mom and pop, family place and it exceeded my expectations.  Could it benefit from an updated look? Sure, but I'm more into good food than good aesthetics. It's got a bit of a NYer attitude, if you can't handle that, don't come - your loss."}
{"text":"best pizza & wraps in town. been going for yrs. donna is sweetheart  who takes care of everything."}
{"text":"What a fail. Bad pizza with low quality ingredients and sketchy building and service. Bullet hole in the window and dirty tables, how is this place still in business?"}
{"text":"I called to order delivery and this adorable raspy voiced lady kept me chatting while she pulled someone's pie out of the oven and boxed it.  I ordered the 18\" meat lovers pizza, 2 dozen wings, antipasti salad and a couple cannolis for my husband and myself.  We've barely made a dent in all this food!  The pizza crust is perfect, they were super generous with the meat.  The wings were a perfect extra crispy as I requested.  The salad was fresh, cold and crisp.  The cannoli was complete heaven.  The delivery time was about 50 minutes, which I was informed of when I placed my order.  It was all well worth the wait!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We order the same thing... pizza wraps. they are good and fillng. iced tea hits the spot. Typical strip mall pizza."}
{"text":"Best takeout pizza I've had in a while. It is classic, loaded with herbs and olive oil - just the way I like my late night pizza. Great sauce, crust, cheese. All around a good bet."}
{"text":"The pizza, salad and Donna are amazing!  They are not that expensive but they have the  BEST pizza out there!!  I am so glad we found this place.  We frequent this place for lunch as it's pretty close to work.  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are on a mission to find the best eggplant parm in town. This place may be the best! The sauce was top notch! It was so delicious! The owners are super cool too. We will definitely be back. ALOT."}
{"text":"Great!!! Donna is a wonderful, friendly person. The pizza, salad & wings are all great!!! I'm really impressed and don't know how I've always lived here and never knew this place was here with so much to offer. My new go to!"}
{"text":"I've had a few different experiences at Slice of Sicily.  Sometimes the service is fantastic and friendly, other times it's slow and rude.  But I think the food is always good, especially the pizza and the baked ziti.  The lasagne is also very good.  They have slices too, which is nice if you don't feel like eating much.  A slice and a salad makes for a good, quick lunch.  They have a fairly good wine list and an appetizer list that just never catches my eye.  It's not that the apps are bad, they just don't stand out at all."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Slice of Sicily since they opened for their delicious pizzas salads and calzones. The portions are a good size with the calzone being definitely enough for two meals, fill it with your favorite ingredients for deliciousness. We stop and fill a growler with beer then head on over to get the white pizza with chicken is my favorite!  Bill cooks up some great dishes and Donna keeps the dining experience fun and treats everyone like family. They have both been in the business for so many years and know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 slices a salad and meatball sub ,  salad came out quick we ended up leaving after waiting 30 minutes for the rest of the order,"}
{"text":"hey mr Scottsdale--you clearly don't know ny pizza.  the gravely smoking lady is part of the ambiance.  You don't deserve to eat REAL NY Pizza.  I am a Brooklyn girl and love Slice of Sicily!!"}
{"text":"this is the designated place to lunch while at work. i've tried a handful of items on the menu but my favorite is still the pizza wrap with meatball and ricotta..YUM! i love supporting family businesses like this one, especially if they serve good food.   be forewarned...the restroom is a little awkward to get to...let's just say it's not ADA compliant. :)"}
{"text":"We just love the white pizza here at this place!  It is almost like eating a warm cheesy garlic bread but only it's better than that!!!! The lunch special served here is very reasonable  Great service that is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"How have I never even heard of this place?!?! The husband and I wanted to get Italian and were planning on going somewhere else.... but it was so far away... and we were so hungry.... so I looked on Yelp (of course) and found this hidden gem! This place is so awesome. It is totally a throw back... red table clothes that are wipe cleanable, a CRT tv playing true crimes sitting on the counter, and Donna. Oh my goodness, Donna is one of the most awesome ladies I have come in contact with in a long time. She is definitely an East coast kinda lady, she is a no nonsense straightforward gal, but also a really sweet and thoughtful person.... they were out of lasagna tonight, but she could tell I really wanted it and got the kitchen to make one special for me...how above and beyond is that? Not only that, but the lasagna was legit.... two different types of sausage, a ton of melty cheese, and a nice flavorful sauce. It was also huge, plenty for two meals. It came with garlic bread that was actually garlicky (I know, crazy) and was a great complement to the pasta. We also had a pepperoni calzone which was ridic good. The ricotta was well seasoned, the crust was perfectly cooked, crispy, and had garlicky seasoning on top. I would definitely get this again. Oh ya, it was also big enough for two meals. All of this food was 20$.... you heard me, 20$!!! This was quite the deal. I think we found our new favorite Italian place in Phoenix.... We'll be back and suggest you give it a shot too!   PS they are BYOB PPS this place has 5 star potential, I just need a second visit to confirm the experience."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Ever!! The Calzone is to die for. We love Donna and the relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't believe I waited so long to try this gem in my backyard. Slice of Sicily blows any pizza chain out of the water! Friendly service too, and love that it's locally owned. I had the white pizza and it was delicious. No skimping on cheese here. The crust was perfect. We also ordered the garlic twists. I think next time I would just go with the pizza. I will definitely be back and looking forward to trying some of the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Closed down, was excited to try the newer location but it's gone, hope the original owner lady is doing good, she was always was pretty funny and angry."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much but the food is phenomenal! I am such a fussy eater - Especially when it comes to pizza but my oh my is this just amazing. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Calzones!! This has got to be THE best place for a calzone, hands down. Packed full of cheese, wrapped in a tasty crust,  and then, for a few bucks more, add all your favorite meats and tasty morsals...you'll be walking away feeling like you really ate something special."}
{"text":"For me, it's all about the food. This is the best pizza in Phoenix. For me anyway. This should have been picked on Best of Phoenix New Times. Not that they need it, this pace is always hopping. I am from Jersey and you're gonna get that Jersey feel there. The waitress, (I think her name is Donna) makes me homesick every time I go or for pizza to go. She is a true star. She is part of the experience god bless her heart. The pizza is perfect- the sauce is so important, ( for me, it can make or break the experience ). The crust and cheese all blend and don't compete for flavors. I gotta tell you, that first bite and the end of that slice is sublime. Oh, and their calzones are huge. I really should try their other stuff, but I need their pizza.  Bianco Shmianco."}
{"text":"we've never had a bad pizza from this place. we usually get their white pizza (the ricotta is so damn good) and add tomatoes. add a cannoli to round off the meal!"}
