{"text":"What a wonderful discovery this place has been!  I first found out about it in a word-of-mouth referral.  They give you a free birthday meal from their buffet.  The elderly lady who runs the place is a very giving sort of person and she encouraged us to take an orange from her fruit selection near the desserts 'for the road' as we were stuffed already.  She said it brings good luck.  The food is excellent and if anything starts running out, boy does she ever crack the whip with the cooks there.  That food is replenished FAST.  The selection is very good and everything I took was appetizing.  They only have canned pop, so because its not from a fountain you would not have a free refill, however, most people ordered water to drink and some asked for Chinese tea."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for about 20 years. This place is not flashy nor has a great atmosphere. It is a cute little family run business that treats their customers like friends. Food is good, and their buffet is usually well stocked. Theymake the greatest Hot & Sour Soup in the city."}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery from this place and food was disgusting.  I have never had bad Chinese food until tonight.  Then when I called to complain the lady on the phone told me she was too busy to deal with me and she already spent too much time talking to me!  I guess the are not into customer service.  There are too many other restaurants so do your selves a favour and skip this one.  Unless of course you like raw food with no taste."}
{"text":"My staff just went back today, one of them had never eaten there, and she charged them $18 this time!!!! Unreal and totally uncalled for.  She not only charged them $18, she took the cookies right out of Jeanette's hand and told her \"no, too much\" and put them back on the Buffet!!!!!  then didn't even give her a drink that comes with the take out.   I'd avoid this place all together, I've had to adjust my rating to one star which I don't even think it deserves."}
