{"text":"I have to give this spot a low rating for their customer service. They have run a few groupbuy vouchers in the past and are treating voucher holders as second class customers. Even if you want to eat at the SLM in the area in front of where they booth is they want to charge you $2 for a container.  How much can these containers actually cost?  Why discriminate against voucher holders and make them feel ripped off? I have been there 10+ times before and now I won't be going back.  There are so many more friendly options in SLM."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to getting down to St Lawrence to check out this raw food restaurant, however sadly it was a complete disappointment.  I ordered the sun dried tomato wrap which was very, very bland. I'm not sure what was in the wrap other than shredded carrot and beets and a few greens. If they added any kind of a sauce or dressing it I couldn't detect it  as was there was no flavour to the wrap whatsoever. If I wanted to just eat raw vegetables I could have brought some from home. I was expecting a bit of taste sensation and there was absolutely none. The wrap was desperately in need of some lemon juice or herbs, anything but that dull bland flavour.  The 2 women behind the counter were unfriendly and not at all interested in me as a customer and the food is  over-priced. The wrap on it's own came to over $11 with tax and the \"special\" juice of the day, a tiny cup of pink grapefruit juice was an additional $3.50. I definitely would not recommend this restaurant nor will I return.  My friend had the pancakes and they were equally unappealing in texture, appearance and taste. The servings are so tiny, the server put a total of 3 slices of banana as a topping for the 2 pancakes. It was like are these rationed out?"}
{"text":"Several of us went to check out Cruda Cafe right after the Christmas rush. The cafe is a little tricky to find (it's on the lower floor) if you have not been to St. Lawrence market before but getting lost among the hundreds of food and drink stalls is a wonderful experience as there is so much to see and taste!  Since we are not too familiar with raw foods, we asked the person at the counter what their most popular dishes are. They said that the Nut burger and Gypsy Sandwich were some of the top choices, so we went with those. We also ordered a Sunshine smoothie and a choco-pineapple bar to top everything off.  All in all, the food was wonderful! Yes it is a lot different than the deep-fried, processed food you would normally get at a take out counter but is fresh, light and very filling - no doubt! We all left feeling very satisfied and refreshed which was terrific when considering all the heavy, carby holiday foods we'd all been consuming in the past weeks. Also, yes, the prices are a bit high for a take out place but I wouldn't say they were 'through the roof' - entrees are about $9/each.   The only thing that prevents me from giving this place a full 5 out of 5 is (as some previous reviewers have already mentioned) is the service, or to be more specific, the counter-help. We were greeted by a woman who was not very friendly and, sensing our inexperience with raw food, didn't offer to suggest anything. Also, we paid with a coupon deal and she was a little curt with us about that. Oh well, the money we saved using the coupon compensated for the lack of nice attitude. There was another woman preparing the food and she was sooo friendly and she made things a little more welcoming. I will return to this place in the future."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for a 5 day cleanse. The write up on groupon indicated you would receive instructions and support on what to eat before and after the cleanse to prepare your body, and what time of day to drink your six bottles of juice. I booked my groupon went to the cafe and was handed a box of bottles and that was that. I had to rely on write ups online as to how to prepare for the cleanse and what time to drink my juice.   I dropped off my bottles today ( -21 outside) to receive my deposit back however since they were washed in the sink and not in a dishwasher they refused them. Again NO instructions to dishwasher wash them. What's even more frustrating I asked if the bottle company was going to sterilize them and the answer was yes!   compete lack of support and instructions provide. Beware if you going to buy one of their expensive cleanses on their website."}
{"text":"I've only recently ventured into the world of raw food so I'm not an expert, but I really enjoyed my experiences here.  I've had the pizzeta and tacos which, admittedly, had many of the same ingredients on them which I found strange (guac on pizza?)  but still delicious.    The mushroom nut burger was off putting at first because I was expecting a bun of sorts but opened my container to reveal two thick slices of not-quite-ripe tomato instead.    The patty itself was tasty and moist and I ended up cutting the 'burger' into small pieces and making one large salad out of it.  The avocado cream, shredded beets and carrots balanced out the the undressed arugula with sweetness and moisture.  all in all it was a tasty lunch that filled me up completely without leaving me comatose.    I see that there are complaints about the service but I've never had any problems with them.   The guy who served me on my first visit explained what everything was (I did tell him it was my first experience), my second visit I wasn't particularly open to being social  so I ordered and left with minimal chatter.     On my third visit I was signing up for the 4 day juice cleanse while I waited for my lunch.  When I got there there was no line but once we started with scheduling people arrived.  The lady continued to book me in while taking orders.  Normally I get pretty pissy about that kind of thing (one customer at a time, please!) but I didn't feel slighted at all.   Maybe because I knew signing up at lunch time was a dumb move on my part :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I go to the market to pick up some goods I like to drop by and pick up a smoothie, or whatever you want to call it.  So far I had the love my liver, clean me, and sunshine smoother and they all tasted great.  The prices seem a little high but its a raw food and its the st lawrence marker. I get it.  The only negative is that the blonde curly haired lady seems to be in a bad mood whenever I get served by her. Lighten up lady. This is America, faking happy at work is a corner stone."}
{"text":"Terrible service and meh bland food for not cheap.  Went in last week for the raw tacos (based on a recommendation) - they were not great, pretty soggy & fell apart right away. Seemed like the tomatoes & maybe other toppings needed to be strained before being thrown in there, bottom of the take out container was a puddle by the time i got back to my office (2 minutes).   The service though!! Not that it can even be called that! The tacos were $12, so came out to $13 something with tax. I handed the cashier a $50, she said she didn't \"THINK\" she'd have change for that in the til. I waited and she stared at me. I assumed she'd check the til, and after an uncomfortable silence asked whether she's checking or what. She said she didn't need to check, now ( a minute or two later of just staring straight ahead) she was \"SURE\" that she wouldn't have enough change. Mmmmkay.... I understand that it's annoying to make change for larger bills but come on, you don't have a $20 and a $10, or 2 $10s & 2 $5s?? it's st lawrence market, there are lots of office workers and tourists out for lunch and you have no cash in your til becaaaaause you don't want our money?? just go in your wallet and stock the til with at least a few bills for the day.   Ok, I said i could pay with interac (didn't feel i had much choice as the other employee had already started making the tacos, since this awkwardness had already gone on for several minutes) and was prompted by the machine to add a 15%, 18% or 20% tip.... this is not a full service restaurant but a stand in the market like all the others, why would you assume a tip will be provided? Was difficult to navigate the interac machine to NOT tip, counter girl was super curt and said just press 0 (which i had done several times by now since it's not my first day on the planet), which did not work, but she insisted that it did... while i was trying it on the machine in front of her eyes and it clearly did not.   Never going again. Just cause it's vegan and organic doesn't mean it should get your business cause you're trying to be healthy or whatever. Have better standards, people!! Evolution Food Co is just on the other side of Market St & doing it better. As is b.good just over on Front.  And with smiles all around!"}
{"text":"The reason I gave 1 star instead of 2, the owner. She was so rude and cold. Maybe it's arrogance? The first time I went, I got a great nori wrap, and served by an extremely friendly older gentleman. The second and third (and FINAL) time, I was served by the owner. I ordered a juice, and she wanted to serve me an already made one-and cold foods are not good for one's body. I asked her to prepare me one fresh, and she reiterated that they had already been made. That was the last time I went... Too bad that her attitude is taking away from people's experience.."}
{"text":"I have quite a bit of experience with eating raw food--both in preparing it myself and dining out. This was the worst raw experience I've ever had, dining out.  I had the very berry smoothie and the enchilada wrap. The smoothie's flavour was ok...it's hard to go wrong with a drink made of such sweet fruit. The texture was awful though--I could have made a smoother smoothie with my 20 year old blender at home--and I'm pretty sure they watered it down significantly, at least it tasted that way.   The enchilada was bland--from the wrap to the chili inside. Also, the ingredient combination just didn't make sense to me, and didn't suit my tastes--why were there two random pecans at the bottom of the wrap?  I don't think I would have been so harsh on the food, if the customer service had not been so awful. The woman handling the cash seemed miserable and was rude...I can understand the misery of having to serve customers all day, but no need to be rude about it!  I hope no one who eats here takes this as typical of raw food cuisine, which can be amazing, and very exciting. Please try Live Food Bar or Rawlicious for a pleasant raw experience!"}
{"text":"Cruda was one of my favorite lunch spots. I live and work in the area and on the average week I would go at least 4 times..either picking up lunch or picking up dinner. Then....a 'groupon' deal came up. Naturally being a regular I bought it right away. The first time I went there with a coupon I was treated like a unwanted customer. Horrible service. I asked for one thing and they gave me another. I suddenly lost all respect for cruda. The friendly people that use to serve me lunch treated me like I was an annoyance. Why do a 'groupon' if ur not going to follow through with it ? Lost all respect and never went back."}
{"text":"As a raw foodist I say the food is ok but overpriced.  The customer service though is a HUGE downfall,  The owner always doesn't smile, say hi, nothing.  Just rude.  Too bad because business won't last long like that."}
{"text":"I got a coupon ($15 for $28) and ordered a \"very berry\" juice/smoothie, a \"st. lawrence market\" salad, and a Gnocchi.  I saw them making the juice and there was very little things that they put in, so the juice is really more like water.  The salad was a little better, at least they put about a quarter of avocado in it.  The Gnocchi tasted weird, a bit sweet, but the dressing is not bad.    The problem I had was the portion.  There were mostly fillers and very little substance.  It was not worth the price at all.  And they charged me $4 on two take-out containers.  I thought that was a bit sneaky and that they should have stated that somewhere or told me before hand."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. Worst customer service ever. The woman was ssooooo unfriendly, AND didn't wash her hands before making my food. I don't know why I didn't leave right then. The food was bad to the max. No flavour, awful texture, and pricy. Stay away at all costs."}
{"text":"The food and service both sucks! I've been there couple times just to give them a chance because I want to eat healthy. The food is just very blah and flavorless. Their ingredients aren't even special or anything.   Not one staff I've came across was proving good service. Two years ago, the person who served me was rude. Last year, the same thing. This year, nothing different. The food didn't improve as well. Flavorless!   Never spending a dime there again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Creative healthy recipes. Some items are slightly overpriced (I.e. smoothies). Hope to come back some day."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Cruda until I tried to order some platters from them for a party I was hosting. While the person I initially corresponded with online was helpful, she stopped answering my emails once I tried to place the order.  A second email asking her to confirm the order also went unanswered. What a shame.  The food was great but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I don't think I would have tried CrudaCafe, if my raw vegan friend didn't take me there.   Raw vegan food is definitely not mainstream, it's not for everybody for sure.    So far, I have been to Cruda twice.  Last time I was there, I had their Gnocchi Carbonara - \"Gnocchi\" was quite tasty (rather nutty) and spiral zucchini \"noodles\" were surprising good.  We also tried the raw raspberry chocolate pie, which was decent.  This time, my frd and I shared a Pizzeta (tomato flax thin crust topped with our house creamy cheese, tomato, olives, avocado, sprouts, paired with a small salad), the pizza was only so-so.  We had pancakes as well, the texture of the pancakes were more on the moist side, but you can't go wrong with chocolate and banana.    Overall, I 'll say if you haven't tried raw vegan food before, go give it a try.  Keep an open mind, it may give you a nice surprise.   My only complaint would be it's a bit on the pricy side.... Unfortunately, healthy food always comes with a price tag..... =("}
{"text":"I had the green wrap and it was pretty good but hard to hold and the sauce dripped all over. I was thankful I wasn't eating with anyone looking at me (or so I believe ha). Overall delicious way to get your veggies in. 10.50 for a wrap"}
{"text":"It was both good and bad, but erring more on the side of bad because I wouldn't come back here unless I was in the area, couldn't leave and was FORCED to eat something because I am hungry and about to chew a table leg for nutrients.  The main takeaway from this review? THEY ARE STINGY with a capital bolded S.  THE GOOD: - The \"burger\" made of wild mushrooms and nuts was fricking delicious. Like super yummy, OMG I need this recipe delicious. I can't even believe it was vegan AND raw. - The \"cheesecake\" with blueberries was decent; as in able to be eaten but.....  THE BAD:  - The \"cheesecake\" was super sweet. Cloyingly sweet. I don't know how people eat this and not throw up after, but then again, I've been really cutting back on my sugar, so everything tastes super sweet to me if it's \"normally\" sweetened. It would be a thousand times more delicious if it was half as sweet.  - The cake was also a bit gummy. I mean, I'll eat it, but I am no way fooled into thinking it is a cheesecake by any means. The cheesecake at Rawlicious in Yorkville is much more authentic (the chocolate one that is, because the key lime one is nurrrsty.)  Cost: $7 ... and the price is not even bloody listed on the menu, so I feel like they just looked at me and made up the price because I looked like someone who was bursting with money to be able to eat RAW VEGAN food at a premium, while surrounded by meat and dairy products (cheese), and other COOKED foods in the market.  - The \"burger\" was as I said, delicious, but the arugula greens around the burger were not even attempted to be dressed with any kind of balsamic vinaigrette (I don't like oily dressings), and was just bland until I poured some balsamic vinegar on them. Then they were edible.  - The burger was also just two huge chunks of tomato with a thin, rather nasty looking black nut & mushroom patty which turned out to be SO DELICIOUS even though it looks disgusting, with a very small dollop of some \"guacamole\". I don't even want to call it a guacamole because it was more like an avocado cream. I mean, I was expecting at least 2 large slices of avocado on top of the burger for $13, considering that she only put 5 little pieces of pea sprout microgreens (I counted).  All in all the burger had: 1. Two large slices of tomatoes, flanking the insides as the \"bun\" 2. 1 small, thin, black, disgusting-looking but VERY YUMMY nut and mushroom patty 3. a small teaspoon dollop of \"guacamole\" cream 4. 5 strands of microgreens 5. Arugula surrounding the outside (a good two handfuls).  $13? Methinks not. I would need 2 large slices of avocado on there in addition to the rest, and MORE microgreens and \"guacamole\" cream.  - Now we come to the \"smoothie\", which cost $7.50 for the \"My Roots\" one, I took the most expensive one just to see what I would get for the money.  BIG. MISTAKE.  It was just disgusting. Then again, juiced beets are kind of nasty because they taste like red water dirt to begin with, but ... hey, I was trying to go healthy.  No, what bothered me the most was that the cup was small, it was HALF FOAM and it was disgusting and not even chilled to begin with.  Aside from the super delicious burger patty, I wouldn't come back here or even consider buying anything from this overpriced shack.  I'd rather walk to First Canadian (BMO building) and go to Kupfert and Kim for a Oxaca salad, and a smoothie, for about $20, which is super filling.  This place, cost me:  $13 - Burger $7.50 - Smoothie (My Roots) $7 - Cheesecake ---------- ~$30 at the end  .... and I was still hungry a bit afterwards.  The only thing that saves them with an additional star was the yummy burger patty."}
{"text":"Visited them the last weekend. Wife had tacos. They were 16$ for raw Tacos and they tasted absolutely horrible. Didn't have any taste or flavor. She somehow managed to eat one of them; we took the second one home. By the time we reached home (within an hour), entire car was stinking with its smell. We just threw it in the garbage bin in the parking. It didn't even make to home. Never ever eating that again."}
{"text":"I got a wrap and a juice. Wrap was good, filling and tasty. It contained some raw cheese guacamole (maybe or maybe wishful thinking) and  other things I can't remember...which is exactly the problem. Wish I knew what was inside it if the guy explained and sold the damn thing to me at $12 raw dollars so I feel more special eating it. Small Juice was also $7 + tax... you do the math! Bottom line is that it is overpriced and I feel bad for the lady ahead of me who got a tiny but raw salad . You know they sell lettuce heads for $2 at the grocery store right across the market and they are raw!!! :))) 3 stars because it was the only place I could it in a market full of meat and it didn't taste bad."}
{"text":"I bought the 5-day juice cleanse for my gf and I over the holidays from Groupon. It cost $109 per person, which seems like a fair deal. When I called in to arrange picking up the juices, I was then informed that I would be charged $5 per bottle, for 6 juices per day for 5 days. That's a total of an extra $150 for 30 little bottles which can't be returned for deposit.  Add tax, and the $109 is now close to $300, for five days of juice, per person.   Fortunately, Groupon refunded my money, but they need to update their fine print with the truth. Currently it says there's a $7 per day glass bottle fee. It's actually $30."}
{"text":"I ate at the cruda cafe earlier today for the first time. I had the Burger with guacamole and tomatoes and it was really delicious. What I liked most about the cruda cafe was how nice the owner is and how I could immediately tell how much she cares about the food she serves. She makes everything herself by hand which I really like, and the prices were very reasonable. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what the complaints about.  I did the four day juice cleanse using a coupon from LivingSocial.  It has change me permanently.  I see one person complain that she had drank the juice by 2 pm.??  There are 6 bottles and you are instructed to drink them 2 hours apart.  That to me is 10 - 12 hours of food depending on how you want to count.  Let me say when I did the cleanse I weighed 225 pounds on a 6 foot frame.  Not a small person.  Was I hungry? Day 1 most definitely, Day 2 okay getting in the rhythm...Day 4 I went to a children's party where they served pizza at 7 pm.  I still had the dinner juice left at that point and so I drank that.  Since then I have lost 10 more pounds because I learned that one may not need the amount of food you believe you do,  one just needs to use more discipline.   Did I like all the juices? No.  I like the fruit ones a lot. Hey they are sweet . ;)  But the other ones were edible, I found them tasty, maybe not the taste I like but they were tasty..  A cleanse is supposed to be something that you use for change.  I am going to say the cleanse changed my life.  I am healthier than I have been in probably 20 years.  I have dropped a size in clothes.  That is in no small part due to the cleanse.  I have already signed up for another one.  i have tried to convince my friends to try them as well.    I want to thank the Cruda Cafe."}
{"text":"Throw out any ideas you have about snacking on carrot sticks and gnawing on trail mix as a concession to raw food, because Cruda is definitely a raw taste sensation!  They're tucked away in the basement of the St Lawrence Market, but the couple of times i've been there's been at least a couple of other people waiting for orders there with me so I don't think the location is hurting them. (It is a bit of a pain due to lack of seating in busier times though).  I've tried a variety of things here now, and I feel confident in recommending it as the nicest raw food i've had in Toronto. When last I visited I tried the (amazing!) raw pizza and with that and the gorgeous greens accompanying it, each bite was a burst of freshness and flavour. Fresh juices abound & there's a nice variety of raw desserts (the chocolate mousse tart is a delicious adventure in cocoa and avocado love). Even the salads are chock full of goodies and made interesting!  Raw food establishments tend to be on the pricey side due to the ingredients (lotsa nuts 'n' seeds) and prep time and effort needed; this holds me back from a 5 star experience, however. I generally don't eat out at raw restaurants much, but all things considered, Cruda makes it all taste worthwhile."}
{"text":"This is a really cool concept but I think a lot of things need to change for this to work. One of the main things that needs to change is the owner's attitude and her customer service skills.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. If you really want to experience raw food go to Live or Rawlicious and you will not be disappointed even if you pay slightly higher prices.   Although the food isn't so bad at Cruda (seriously though, try Rawlicious first), it's fairly overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times. As far as price goes - it's the cheapest raw food you can get in Toronto.  Raw truffles for $1?!! What the hey!? Mains for 7-9$? Whoa!  I've had the ravioli (paper-thin baby turnip layered with cheesy cashew pesto sauce), the burger (HUGE slices of the freshest tomato and boston lettuce you've seen - wrapped around a crunchy creamy burger made with nuts, mushrooms and goodness. Topped with sprouts and guac!), a couple small desserts... It's REALLY good!  I read the one review that was here before I wrote this. I have to say that I think it's written by someone who doesn't know anything about raw food. Raw food - to get it right - is really difficult! You've got to be pro. Otherwise it's just boring carrots and nuts or something. If you like raw food you will love what Claudia serves up (she's also REALLY nice!) AND you will be amazed at her prices. Check out Live and Rawlicious for sure - great food but even more pricier than Cruda.  Lastly, I don't want to be mean, but there are a gazillion veggie/vegan restaurants in Toronto! I haven't even been to all of them and I really like trying them all - so I really mean gazillion! ;) Check out veg.ca for a whole list of them..."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to eat healthy. So when FabFind had a deal for Cruda Cafe a while ago, we bought 3 vouchers.  We got the chance to try different options from their menu: The Quezadilla, a couple of different wraps that they don't seem to offer anymore and the Gnocchi Carbonara.  Naturally everything was super fresh and healthy, however I didn't really like anything but the Gnocchi Carbonara and their guacamole. Those two were awesome. As for the rest we tried:  All of those items came with either wraps or breads that were dehydrated and while I understand that this is the process that makes it especially healthy, I just didn't like the taste.  Plus it was really sticky and I found it uncomfortable to eat.  I also have to say that I was not impressed by the service. The first two times we went, the ladies behind the counter were \"just\" uninterested and kind of sour, but last time they were actually rude.  We were charged $3 extra for take out containers which had not happened before. There is also no sign up anywhere. They didn't mention that at all, but just told us the total we had to pay.  It seemed off to us, so we asked some questions and they got annoyed that they had to explain things to us.   To top it off: They basically called us out as liars when we mentioned that we had never paid extra for containers before.  They said that they have always been charging for those since they are biodegradable and \"to encourage customers to bring their own containers\".   How are you encouraged to bring your own container when nobody tells you that you have to pay extra for a take out box from the store? Complete BS..."}
{"text":"5 stars on the rawraps and super bowl. 2 stars on the poor attitude of the staff. They seem to be perpetually lacking in energy and enthusiasm and just general friendliness or helpfulness... Perhaps you develop a thick skin dealing with people at St. Lawrence market day in and day out but I don't see this consistently with other vendors and so unfortunately it stands out to me.  Highlight: Green wrap (seasonal veggies, organic raw pate, avocado and sun flower sprouts) Tasty and ultra satisfying; it keeps me full for many hours."}
{"text":"Green Wrap was incredible--so fresh tasting and the avocado and vegetable fillings were so flavourful... with it being all raw you think it might not be filling, but I was more than filled. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"I had the raw pad Thai. Compared to places like rawlicious and fresh restaurant, the portion size was significantly smaller and it didn't taste as flavourful. The sauce was creamy and simply tasted like almond butter or cashew butter on zoodles. It wasn't enough to fill me though. The man at cash was nice, the service was okay, I think it could be a little more organized since it was a bit slow. It seems pretty popular though, considering how busy it got."}
{"text":"My only other vegan dining experience was at Fresh on Bloor - and I must say, Cruda kicks their ass!  I had a Dealathon voucher in hand for $30 worth of food (I paid $15).    While their portion sizes are nowhere near as big as Fresh, the quality is great!  As Janna S. said you are going to have to pay a bit of a premium to get the gluten-free, organic, raw food experience.  You have to pay a premium in general to eat healthy.  It sort of seems counter intuitive to me, but you can't put a price tag on your health right?  Even just a crappy salad at Freshii costs $12 - and its not organic.   With that said, I ordered:  Clean Me (Apple, carrot, ginger, & lemon juice): I might have to rekindle my love of juice minus the added sugars at Cruda.  This was refreshing, and provided me the energy boost I needed to survive quarter end at work.  Keeping in mind, I was so busy today that I didn't even have my coffee!  Sundried Tomato Wrap (seasonal veggies, organic raw pate, avocado and sunflower sprouts): The wrap can take a little getting used to since it is a dehydrated wrap and therefore, is dry and a bit coarser than normal.  The organic raw pate was quite tasty.  Seasonal veggies included radish, beets and arugula.  I found this wrap to be savoury for what it was, but just try to keep things relative (e.g. it is not going to compare to wraps topped with cheese and beef etc).    St. Lawrence Green Market Salad (micro greens, carrots, beets, avocado, figs, goji berries, nuts and seeds, infused with kombucha coconut oil agave dijon dressing):  I would've preferred fresh figs since the goji berries were dried, it was not a well-diversified dish from a textural perspective.  The dressing was pretty scant.  The avocado used was browning due to oxidization.  With that said, the salad was surprisingly filling but some may find it tastes a little too \"green\" for their liking.    Verdict:  Will be coming back for more of Cruda's healthy food which doesn't compromise on flavour.   Mango Tart:  I swear I died and went to heaven when I ate this!  The filling was smooth and creamy, and the pie crust was to die for!  It was made with nuts and coconut from what I could gather."}
{"text":"I used to love Cruda Cafe when I worked in the area. I love the vegan local organic idea and that it's a small local restaurant! However the customer service, as others have said is just simply bad. The wild mushroom burger is the only thing I could recommend.   I did a 5 day juice cleanse here after purchasing it off if Groupon. So many problems, the difficulty of getting the juices, they are not labelled and the last day of my cleanse they told me the machine broke? And I received no refund or anything-which was weird.   I gave to stars because I love that its vegan and local. However they should consider a kinder and better staff as well as take off their juice cleanses from Groupon."}
{"text":"Compared to the raw vegan dishes at live it does not come close. However it's raw and vegan and no sugar so I can't complain."}
{"text":"i was craving something healthy so why not A vegan raw place especially considering that st lawrence market doesnt have a lot to offer in terms of healthy options.  anyway.  i will say that the menu is creative.  and they definately have a unique visio  and take on thibgs.  i oredered the \"pizza\" and a smoothy.  my total cane up to 23 dollars.  i understand that perhaps healthy ingridients cost more organic etc etc but at the end of the day feel like it was over priced.    the food wasnt bad... it was good.  not spectacular .. taste was a but better than average.  presentation was great. bt definately over priced."}
{"text":"My partner and I did a juice cleanse with Cruda Cafe. We tried to get in touch multiple times before we were able to get through to someone. I had sent them an email asking them to call me and they refused. Their phone etiquette was very poor, rude and short. They were not helpful with any of the questions my partner had.   The juice arrived late, so late in fact we could not start our cleanse until the next day. One day the delivery service said they forgot about the juice and it never showed up. When we called Cruda Cafe they told us it was not their problem. Ouch.  They charged way more for bottles than the Groupon said, and the delivery price is out of this world. NOTE: the bottle are not refundable, I have done many juice cleanses and every other business always refunds the bottles.   The juices are okay- but I have had MUCH better. They were very watered down and none of the ingredients are labelled.  I would never use this company again. It is clear that the owner does not care."}
{"text":"Awesome! It's really good food. I'm a vegan and have been moving towards a raw food diet. I've been to Cruda four times and have liked everything so far. My one complaint would be the portion sizes of the wraps. They are really small. But the Sweet Potato sandwich and Gnochi Carbonara were great. It is rather pricey though for lunch which is my one real complaint."}
{"text":"I love that there's a convenient raw food restaurant at St. Lawrence Market. Even more, I LOVE that they had a booth at the CNE this year! Now THAT's progressive!   The food isn't as sophisticated as the other raw restaurants in Toronto, and I don't think that all of the menu items are created equally, but if you order the right thing you won't be let down. I like to pick up their raw wraps to take home too, very convenient and tasty. Perhaps the yummiest thing I've had from them was a raw taco special which wasn't on the regular menu but ask them for recommendations and they'll steer you the right way."}
{"text":"Sweet treats are pricy compared to DIY or Kupfert & Kim, etc, but overall prices and food quality are standard for vegan places in Toronto.  I stopped by the market this morning around 9AM for a pre-run snack and was determined to find Cruda Cafe ever since I read about a raw vegan, sugar-free cafe existing somewhere at the St. Lawrence Market amidst all the meat and cheese stalls. They're located on the lowest floor inside at the back corner... Can be tricky to find.  The sugar-free (?) vegan cookies come in cashew and chocolate flavors, for $3 each. Try the chocolate cookie! It's moist, not overly sweet, and has an interesting heterogeneous texture. I was also interested in the breakfast options, for $10.50 - granola or vegan pancakes. Power bowls, wraps, and salads are also available here for around $15.  They do accept credit and debit card, but prefer cash."}
{"text":"I visited Cruda Cafe because I had received a coupon for $20 worth of food at this place. I had read reviews in the NOW newspaper about it, and had high expectations for probably what is the only vegan/raw place in St Lawrence Market, which isn't exactly a vegetarian friendly place.  Cruda Cafe is tucked away in a corner on the bottom floor, it is kind of difficult to miss at first. Once I did find it, I saw it was a cute looking place.   Since this was my first time going here, I asked for some recommendations. I'm not sure if it was because I had the coupon, but I felt that the women working there were less then enthusiastic about suggesting food. I decided on the Gnocchi Carbonara, which came to around $10.50, meaning I still had some money left to spend with the coupon.   The description sounded good, but I was grossed out by the gnocchi, which was made up of cashews and something else. They were so dense they were difficult and uncomfortable to chew, almost nauseating. It's a good thing there were only 4 gnocchi dumplings, because they were pretty unpleasant to eat. These were placed on the biggest bed of julienned zucchini I've ever seen- there must have been at least 2 whole zucchinis in my meal. The zucchini was tossed with some sort of sauce, I think it was asparagus. I couldn't even bring myself to finish the meal, it was bland and way too much of one thing.  Because I had some money left over, I thought I might get some desserts, so I asked for 3 of the truffles ($3 each). The woman working there said I couldn't do that, so I was a bit confused as to what I could get. I didn't even bother asking and just ended up getting my gnocchi to go and left without using the other half of the coupon.  Again, I don't know if it's because I had the coupon, maybe it's because I know zilch about raw food,  but I definitely didn't feel welcomed here. I don't know, maybe next time I'll come back here with someone else, and with some money to try something else- maybe then there wouldn't be so much hostility felt."}
{"text":"This is what I've been looking for -- organic 80% raw, low protein, high carb (80-10-10 diet) food, and I'm happy to have found a resto that supplies high quality food in a plentiful quantity. The only complaint is that I've had CrudaCafe 4 times this week and honestly, every dish has the same basic flavour. They need to use fresh/dried herbs and spices to add healing properties and punch out the flavours since they also use the faux sour cream in almost every dish, it's not varied with a faux cheese (or several), which further leads to everything tasting the same.  I ordered:  Sundried Tomato Wrap for $10.50 Seasonal veggies, organic raw pate, avocado and sunflower sprouts.  It was excellent (see pic) though only had avocado in one tiny corner. There was just enough paté to keep the whole thing from drying out and kept nicely overnight for the next day with the raw wrap not soggy. For the price, quality and taste, you can't get much better. I'd add some Herbes de Provence and sun-dried tomatoes or smoked paprika to the paté for some more flavour, but, still a great item. I'd also like to know what's in the paté. 4/5.   RawTacos $12.00 Dehydrated tortillas, guacamole, re-fried no-beans, salsa, sour no-cream. There were 2 large tacos, so it was a filling meal. Plenty of guac (though why not add some chipotle and/or cumin?)! The salsa fresca was ample as was the sour-no-cream and the no-beans which were made of cut up mushrooms. I received no cutlery, which was needed since the mushrooms made the taco wrap totally soggy and fall apart. I ate it all with my hands, so no pic. 4.5/5 since there was no skimping on ingredients and it was excellent. Could put oregano, thyme, cumin, mesquite in the no-beans cuz it all kinda tasted the same, but still excellent. Smoked paprika in the sour cream. Cumin in the guacamole. Does not keep for next day, total sogginess and wrap falls apart.   Wild Mushroom Nut-Burger for $13.00 Rests in a bed of boston lettuce, tomato, guacamole, carrots, beans and sprouts. It was dark, but seemed like a huge portobello with nut-burger on top with ample fixings. Again, sage and thyme would've been nice since everything has the same basic flavour, but it was filling and excellent. Can keep for next day, maybe squeeze lemon on top to keep guac from oxidizing. 4.5/5  QuicheMeLorraine for $10 I was hoping for the dehydrated onion crust as described on CC's website, but got an almond one instead, which was good, but too pasty and heavy for me to eat the whole thing; I think there was a lot of oil in it. Nice idea. Again with the faux sour cream lending the same old flavour. Needed some fresh basil, tomato, onions on top, and more quiche filling than crust. Quiche Lorraine has a lot of onion, so some sautéed or caramelized onion would be nice, and makes sense. Or, even raw onion. 4/5.  Green Inner Juice for $7.50  Apple, kale, parsley, ginger and lemon Ok this is way different than the Greener Inner on the CC website. Regardless, there was hardly any kale - I'd say 1/8th of a leaf and no discernible parsley or ginger. Basically, a cantaloupe-coloured apple juice, which is cheap and tastes good, but CC is skimping here. 3/5  I'd purchase all of these again except for perhaps the quiche unless they changed the abundant crust. It's actually quite inexpensive if raw and organic since folks don't realize how much work and produce actually goes into the wraps, presentation, *ripe* tomatoes, and the usually ample guac.  This is the healthiest resto in the downtown core, hands down with delicious food no matter what you label yourself! Def the healthiest food on JustEats, too. I'd like to see full ingredients listed somewhere for the wraps, creams, patés, though! Some dishes are prone to too much oil for my likes and I'd like to know which ones. I'd also like to know what the meat replacements are made of so I can know if I tolerate them.  Thank you for some awesome food!  aside - every time I try to order quezadillas on JustEats it tells me \"whoops! Try another restaurant\". They don't care cuz they're a crappy company, so maybe you (CC) can inform them. Sometimes I also have to try to order 5 times before the site works. Those guys are not doing you any favours + probs losing you customers."}
{"text":"I can see how the location and hours of CrudaCafe are obstacles to popularity (in addition to being raw/vegan/healthy in a space where baked goods, meats and cheeses reign) but it seems to me (a person heavily biased in favor of raw food) that the quality of the food makes walking past animal carcasses and bovine rape bi-products by 5pm worth it. The menu is so marvelous to read, I had a hard time not ordering multiple things. But I went with just one thing - the sweet potato mesquite sandwich. The \"bread\" was the best raw bread I've ever had; it was soft, yet sturdy, and flavorful - not at all reminiscent of cardboard. Add some yummy nutty cheese, avocado and a ton of fresh vegetables (including beets, my fave!) and wow, real food tastes so good! My only gripe about this \"sandwich\" is that it was extremely difficult to eat - there was definitely no picking it up due to it's massive size, overflowing bounty of fillings and bed of arugula and even more veggies...a plastic fork was a poor match, but I got through it. It being a very delicious, filling and nourishing meal.  *If you've read my review for Urban Herbivore and saw that I criticized putting potatoes on a sandwich and think I am a totally hypocritical bitch for now honoring a sandwich featuring potato, hi! Potato was serving as a starch in place of bread on this raw sandwich which makes it OK. But potato served on bread as part of a roasted vegetable medley is just cheap filler and superfluous starch that absorbs dressing and detracts from the more delicate flavors and textures of other veggies."}
{"text":"Making raw food delicious is amazing and this place did it well.  I am in awe at this tart they made and am severely disappointed that I didn't buy 2.  They were super tiny but so satisfying.  I love their raw sprouted granola breakfast.  The \"yogurt\" they put in there is actually a perfect pairing for pineapples.  I could eat that yogurt and pineapples all day."}
{"text":"Thought it was delicious! I got the raw taco and my friend got the gypsy burger. You can see the full review here: http://glutenfreebitches.ca/raw-food-toronto-cruda-cafe/"}
{"text":"100% raw vegan.  Nice service, average prices (for raw food that is).  We stop here on every visit to the St. Lawrence Market and pick up 2-3 wraps.  Always good.  Never quite 5 star, but a solid 4.  We've had nearly everything on the menu and it is all equally well prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"Did some shopping at the Saint Lawrence market and decided to eat raw that day, and their mural caught my eye... Ordered their Green Wrap and was very disappointed. Not flavorful at all, just tasted like plain old lettuce and sprouts perhaps it had to do with the gentleman building it? It didn't seem as though it was constructed with any enthusiasm, he even seemed sort of bothered... The wrap also fell apart while eating it. He wrapped it super tightly, but didn't close up the ends, it was really odd, but perhaps that's just their practices? I don't know... I'd like to give it another try, but I definitely won't be ordering a wrap next time..."}
{"text":"Stellar! Others complained about bad service from the owner but I am unable to comment as I order thru a delivery service. The food was delightful, we had ordered several dishes and shared them between us. I was surprised how good the food was and how healthy it is as well. I would highly recommend and repeat visits."}
{"text":"I heard about Cruda Cafe very recently since it was featured and listed in NOW mag's best veggie restaurants in the city. It's a raw, live, organic food cafe. I'm not a raw foodie, but do take interest in this type of lifestyle. I've taken to some elements of raw eating since I am working on becoming vegan. First of all there's hardly any veggievegan restos in Toronto anyway, so it seemed to like this NOW mag list covered off pretty much every one.  Cruda is on the bottom floor of St.Lawrence Market in a far away corner. Unless you know this place is here, you'll never come across it. Not a good location.   For someone like me, who is open to raw food, eats vegetarian and almost entirely vegan, is informed about healthy eating, organic food etc. I still found this to be pretty intimidating. Nothing jumped out at me as appetizing when I walked up to the place. The daily soup was RAW Almond Tomato. Which means it's served cold, because it's raw. bleh. I didn't want that. They were out of the raw pizza, since I came later in the day, and all that seemed right to me were the rawraps. I had to ask what the wrap was made out of. I ended up with the Mexico Mio wrap which is corn, flax, herbs and some other kind of seed (sesame?) dehydrated into a flat wrap like thing. You can pick from the veggie counter for fillings, and it also has a cashew pesto creamy spread. The Rawrap was good, fresh, and tasty. But I think it was kinda of small for costing $8.48. But it was good. I am going to make cashew cream with pesto at home. The NOW mag article featured a pic of Crudas chocolate raspberry tart and talked about how popular it is. So I decided to take a piece to go. That cost me $5.09 and unfortunately it was awful. It was also raw. The chocolate filling is like a pudding and it's essentially avocado blended with raw cacao. The whole thing tasted like nothing, was barely sweet at all, and entirely disappointing.   There was also some vegan cupcakes in the window, which were the only non-raw menu item. I can safely say that I bake a better looking vegan cupcake.  Overall if you're into eating vegan and healthy and you're in the area, maybe go try this place for fun. But I assume anyone who eats raw or vegan and is somewhat savvy in the kitchen, like myself, could probably make this type of food at home themselves. Which is what I'll experiment with, but I won't buy lunch at Cruda again."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of raw food, but I totally loved the raw enchilada, stacked with sprouts and creamy avocado! The raw nutballs and spaghetti - suspiciously made of zucchini, but disarmingly good - is also an amazing dish.  Just wishing the portion size was a little bigger, since I could have downed two more of these, considering I chucked $9 for each dish ..."}
{"text":"The drinks and desserts are good. A++ for my drink - the greener inner, which was switched to spinach (alternative to the celery that was unavailable), apple, lemon and cucumber. The service however, is terrible.  The person working was on the phone when I got there so I was waiting to place an order for what seemed like 5 minutes, but, probably was less than that. I asked her what the desserts are, as there were no labels. Understandably menu items may change daily. She conveyed to me what was in the desserts with little excitement & enthusiasm.   I get it, not all days are good days when one works in the Hospitality Industry, I've been there, but it's disappointing to not receive the service one expects, complimentary to that of the ethos of the establishment. This is why expectations, need not exist in the first place.  The phone rang again, she picked it up, it wasn't after a few minutes she proceeded to process my transaction, while still on the phone. This time she had the courtesy to answer the phone because it was ringing like mad, and listening to that incessant ringing when trying to place an order... nothing short of annoying. She actually washed her hands with the intention of touching the veggies and fruits that went into my drink, only to pick up the phone after washing her hands, witnessing this all well, the lack of sanitary practices is enough to turn me away. Regardless, I paid and had been waiting I wasn't going to leave. Not to mention there may be far worse things that happen behind closed doors, or in kitchens that the customer do not see.  She finally finished my drink only to have the phone ring a third time. YES, she answered it. Again, good food/drink, very, very poor service. Especially when I am the only customer. Would I return? Not a chance!  I understand that this might be a place that thrives on catering clientele, yet to have such an awful experience well, that's enough to not go back and to write about it on yelp.  Its also, places like these that has me thinking and agreeing with those that say the service today has declined tremendously (ha, I am even one of those people)... some people in the hospitality and service field lack apathy and they simply do not care... and that is really unfortunate, considering they're working in/with/for the public  Also, the drink I had, had quite a bit of foam, so it wasn't even a full cup of juice of what sized I paid for and at $7.50 plus tax, kinda unacceptable.  It seems like you have to say, \"hold the foam\" on drink orders that may produce such an output!   if you decide to venture here, good luck!"}
{"text":"This place is located in the northeast corner of the St. Lawrence market basement; it's not big but the flavours are worth a repeat visit.  Raw food isn't cheap to make, so you're going to pay a bit more here than some of the other market vendors. However, that being said, I think Cruda makes it worth it. My favourite dessert here is the lemon square! It's made with nuts but it's better than most baked desserts! I have not had anything like this at other raw food places and I hope they don't stop making it.   The wraps and \"pizza\" also taste delicious - there is just so much to savour; I don't want the meal to end!  The portion sizes are not big but you'll probably find the food here filling because they use a lot of nuts/seeds. Delicious!  The seating here isn't great because it's just market benches, but I can usually find a spot. I hope they open another location close to me!"}
{"text":"To be completely honest, I always forget that this place exists. The hours are limited and it is not a convenient spot for me to get to. Additionally, it is usually impossible to find seating. As a vegan, it is not appealing to walk by the many open meat shops at St Lawrence Market in order to get to Cruda.   That being said, the few times I have gone, the food has been delicious. I was pleasantly surprised with the gnocchi carbonara and the tacos were pretty good. I really liked their kombucha a lot (it was my first time ever trying kombucha). I am usually surprised at how full and satisfied I am after eating there. I know I would like to incorporate more raw foods into my diet and compared to other raw places in the city, Cruda would rank at the top for me taste-wise.They have plenty of menu items that I actually do really really want to try, but the sort-of-high prices and the inconvenience of the location keep me from going regularly."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Cruda's food and had always wanted to sign up for their 30-day food program. Finally splurged and dove in. Couple of notes for others thinking of doing the same:  - Thirty days might be too much. While I do enjoy the food, there is a similarity in flavouring in a lot of their dishes. So that after a few days you need a (long) break from it. Especially since it costs so much.  - Do not do not - and I cannot stress this enough - do not rely on their food to start off your day. While they post a 9AM opening time, there's been many a time when I've shown up at 9 or even 9:15 and they're CLOSED. So any attempts to be efficient with your time and get the food pickup out of the way will only result in frustration."}
{"text":"I bought the 5 day raw food detox and it was the best raw meals I've ever had. Everything was delicious and very flavorful. The couple who own the place are also both very friendly and truly enjoy what they do, it's refreshing to see. Try the pancakes and any of the desserts!"}
{"text":"update as of Dec. 27/10: Things are now good.  The owner, Claudia, was receptive to my comments, and did what she could to smooth things over.  I will be continuing to eat here.  The food is good, I seem to really be enjoying 2 options that contain pickled plum sauce (umeboshi): the seaweed wrap $6.50, and market salad $9.00 for the large. The food is good, and the take out containers are all enviro-friendly. If you've got a salad and are doing take out, consider asking for it in a separate container. Thanks for reading this update/thread...   updated on Oct 11/10: I've contacted the owner directly, to let her know of my recent experience there. To her credit, she read (and responded to) my email - although it was, respectfully, not a positive one.  It turns out that it was actually her that I was messaging her about in the first place.  :P  She had her reasons for not smiling, and none of them were due to my using a coupon or how I looked.   I would like to return to Cruda someday and to again share my honest feedback about the place."}
