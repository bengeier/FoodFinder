{"text":"Got a take out pop corn chicken on rice to go.  Not the ordinary pop corn chicken you get at other places.  I don't think it's Taiwanese style.  Willing to try again if their reciepe change."}
{"text":"Located right next to PET and in the same plaza as Pho Metro.   I really wanted to like this place. It hurts me to write a low review for a small family business. I do think this place has potential if work on their recipes. We came on a weekday evening and my family was the only one there the entire sitting. It's a new owner and menu, this place used to be something else before can't remember the name but it was more of an HK cafe before. Now they only do Taiwanese noodles.   My family all ordered 4 different noodle dishes. They came out at different times like probably 2-3 minutes apart from each other. Not sure why service was a little slow considering we were the only ones there. But anyways...the noodles were good, chewy, thick and good texture. When it came to the soup base though it was a letdown. It was extremely salty and lacked flavor. I got the beef brisket with clear noodle soup. The beef briskets were nice and lean.  The portion size was on par for the price we were paying (8.75) for a bowl. I would say it was between a standard medium and large bowl of noodles.  We also ordered a scallion pancake but that was not impressive either. It could definitely be crispier, it was chewy and soft in the center.    During the grand opening, it is 10% off except for the specials. The server was very nice and I can tell the family is trying. I think the husband is the only chef at the time. I think if they work on their recipes and speed it will stand a chance especially once school opens they are going to need that improvement."}
{"text":"This place opened recently in my neighbourhood so I tried it out with my parents. Their noodles are really good, thick and chewy, boiled just right.  Their marinated eggs were really good as well, there was just enough flavour. My mom really liked their popcorn chicken, nice and crispy, just enough seasoning. The pieces were a little bigger than how I prefer them, but it doesn't change the fact that they tasted damn good. I ordered their Two Sauce Hot Dry Noodles, it does have some chili flakes in it so theres a little bit of spiciness. I really enjoyed my noodles so I can't wait to go back and try their other dishes!  I thought their prices were slightly more expensive than some Chinese noodle places of this kind, maybe around 50 cents to a dollar pricier. However its an acceptable price and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Taiwanese Style not equal to Authentic Taiwanese  I really want to give this small family restaurant Cun Wei a chance but it is just not good.  Beef Brisket Noodle Soup ($8.75) ??????? was a complete fail.The soup base which is usually the star was one dimension: overwhelmingly salty to the point of bitterness.   The waitress was nice enough and said she would check with the kitchen. Even with 10% off Grand Opening Special, I feel the food is overpriced vs quality."}
