{"text":"The Habit Burger Grill is such a great place to go out to enjoy a burger! It's a grill with quality service and quality food. Its a small casual place where you can sit with a group of friends, laugh and enjoy your food. The place is welcoming and friendly, the employees are great workers by showing pride in their job. You can walk in and right away fall in love with the place. 

Adding to it is the food ! The burgers are juicy and well made, they aren't like the other fast food where the burger has bad presentation. They have everything a buyer needs and you can even adjust it to your pleasure.The wait is a little long but its worth it. The fries are the best I've tried, they are crispy and have great flavor. The place its self is also great ! its clean, and the style is nice. Its not too loud and its family friendly. My brother took me and my nephews had a great time enjoying our burger at Habit Burger Grill."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Great food and excellent customer service.  I'd driven by here several times and this place is always packed. I tried it for the first time on a very busy Saturday after doing errands and was blown away by the quality of their take out food and malt shakes. The friendly staff really impressed me as well, very professional, polite and helpful. An all around great place."}
{"text":"Never been before, gave it a shot and was not disappointed, Really good tasting burgers and fries, plus really good tasting onion rings, all at a good price."}
{"text":"The burgers are far superior to other burger joints around. The standard cheeseburger with extra grilled onions is what I ordered. Very tasty- tastes like a burger that you could get at a great family BBQ. I ordered fries with my burger. They are just ok. I think I'll give the onion rings a shot next time. The service was very friendly. All the staff seemed to be having a good time at work. I liked this upbeat atmosphere. I'm a fan of Habit."}
{"text":"I am originally from Santa Barbara, CA and was pleasantly surprised to see a hometown burger joint that I absolutely love in Santa Barbara. The quality and taste is not so much here in AZ. What struck me the most was the upkeep or lack of at this location. I was disgusted eating here. The tables were dirty and the floor was worse. Not to mention the almost dead flying flopping around on its last thread of life."}
{"text":"Yes, it's true that messing up a burger is hard to do... but it's definitely possible, and Mcdonald's is a living example, BUT, Habit Burger hits the nail right on the head. The burgers are pure awesome... I'm sad that I don't live closer... but, anyways, the feel of a Habit burger is hard to describe, so you'll have to go try it. But believe me, you WON'T be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I had to remove my other review because first impressions can be wrong.

AWEFUL!! Went with my parents and the rude young girl taking the order messed every burger up! Went up to complain and nobody would listen they kept their heads down and never made eye contact with me.
So I came home and wrote a letter. I gave them a week to get back to me and still no reply. Don't go if you want your order screwed up and you actually want to enjoy your dinner....
We won't be going back to the Habit, ever again."}
{"text":"I drove in becoz every time I see a long drive thru line everytime I'm on blue diamond 
Ordering service is noteworthy - asked if first time visiting them and if say yes they explain their menu and patiently answer your questions 
She recommended the double but I got single 
Food is ok ...I still prefer In & Out for flavor and their addicting sauce 
Another noteworthy item be their tempura fried beans ...doesn't sound too sexy but man, of man ...ill drive by just for this! It's very crispy on outside and naturally moist  green beans inside ...and unlike Tempura which you need digging sauce for flavor ...this is good on its own but they offer Ranch, Thousand Island, etc I got honey mustard and barely used it coz did I say it's tasty on its own ?"}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave this place a shot, I ordered the Santa Barbara and I was not disappointed.  I was surprised to see that you have to pay for fries separately but no biggie. There was not much variety there and I will admit that the employees don't know the menu as well as I expected. (I usually like to as them their recommendation or their most popular item) 

The Santa Barbara was delicious, it comes with bacon, avocado on sourdough bread. (Highly recommend this if you're a simple ingredient type of person) 

Their location is also great, it's across the street from Zoyo's (frozen yogurt) and if you have a picky eater you have chipotle, Mad Greens, NYPD, Wingstop, and Foce guys in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great fries, great everything! My brother recommended this place for me and that's my new spot to go to!"}
{"text":"Habit Burger is in the same neighborhood of burger joints like in-n-out and five guys IMO. it's my favorite of the three, especially since you can get bacon and avocado on a burger. 

Most days I'd rather have it than smash burger unless I'm dying for an egg on top."}
{"text":"Quality offering at a reasonable price? Check.
Burgers fresh and cooked the way they were meant be cooked? Check.
Great fries- 2 kinds no less? Check.

This is a tweener restaurant-perfect for a great casual dinner. Not too expensive. Not cheap and greasy. Just right for that one day of the week when you want something in between.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"I must say this burger definitely surprised me with how good it tasted. It was my first time trying this place and I had my doubts. My buddy kept telling me to try it so I finally did. The quality was great and I loved that they had more choices for toppings and sauces. The service was great and the lady in the front made her rounds to make sure we were doing fine and also took our trays when we were finished unlike other burger joints. I ordered the double char with cheese and also had a side of ranch and jalapeños. Location is kind of far from my side of town but will be visiting again when I am around the location. Thanks for the great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Back to Habit today!
Ordered chicken sandwich and a kid's meal, dine in.
The food was out lightning fast this time, probably 10 employees there to cover the rush. 

Minor complaint... I saw a lot of bodies but only 1 girl on a register at a time. at one point I saw the cashier training another employee.... you would think the manager would have opened up another register instead of letting the line get 3,4 people waiting.

Food was excellent as always.

Thanks Habit"}
{"text":"Burgers are good, the place is usually clean, and the staff is very nice. Just not a fan of the parking lot. Depending on the time of day you go, the place is packed. That corner of 7th ave is a very busy spot and parking can be eventful. Other than parking, I will definitely come back for the food."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to grab a bite to eat. I had the chicken sandwich, loved the option for grilled onions. Definitely a step up from typical fast food. I'll go back again"}
{"text":"I I like this place.  You have a lot of choices when choosing a place to get a burger in Phoenix.  I like that I can get sweet potato fries here.  I also really enjoyed the Teriyaki Burger.  

The only thing that struck me as strange was how nervous both the kids were at the counter.  I don't know if they were new, or just over-trained.  Poor kid asked me how I was at least 3 times.  Chill, dude, chill.  Also the girl at the counter had the highest-pitched voice I've ever heard.  Jeeze.  Everyone realx.  It's just a burger."}
{"text":"The burger here was amazing and the fries were tasty too! I've been dreaming of the hamburger since last Saturday!"}
{"text":"Super bummed, I love this place so much but when I placed an order to go, when I got home I had 2 completely different salads that I didn't order. Staff was nice but just bummed about the wrong order being provided."}
{"text":"First time eating here, wasn't too impressed. Burger was fine but nothing special. Tempura green beans are excellent though! 
They were pretty packed during lunch so make sure you have enough time to wait for your meal."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first tine.Food was pretty good. The workers were very nice people. Seems like a lot of people go to this place daily. It is a fairly new place than other burger joints but decent burgers yo. Can't beat in-n-out though IMO ;)"}
{"text":"The Habit is an okay restaurant. I've been there a few times and the service was okay and the quality was not as good."}
{"text":"I don't think I'm coming back. My burger was just as bad as the one I had at the zoo. After the first bite I wished I had gone to In n Out or Burger King for that matter. The Habit adds no flavor to their char-burgers. The french fries were soggy and awful too. I don't understand these 5 star reviews. If the managers and staff are very friendly, it's only to make up for the bland tasting food."}
{"text":"This is the best and newest burger joint to hit Tempe! I like it a lot better than smash burger! However the price is comparable. Great service, and great food!"}
{"text":"Semi-fast food, I guess is how you would describe it.  We were pleasantly surprised at how non-greasy the burgers were.  They had a great char flavor to them.  I can't wait to try the tri-tip sandwich or the tuna sandwich, both of which I heard were very good.

If you get a meal deal, keep in mind they come with A LOT of fries.  The fries are very good, just too many of them.  The staff is young but seem to learn quickly and are extremely friendly!  We will def be back.

ps - They are open until 10pm!"}
{"text":"These burgers are so much better than the Five Fatburger Guys, et al. Simple, inexpensive, sanely portioned, a great char taste. Fries and shakes are very good too"}
{"text":"Had a tuna burger. Ohhhh sooooo good. Fries are super tasty and I've also had a bacon burger. All very worth it. For a fast food place that's not the same as a traditional fast food, it's awesome. I would say I like it better than in and out. It's restaurant quality that's cheaper and faster!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I first heard of The Habit from a friend. It was amazing for our first time there! The staff were so friendly!! We both ordered the Santa Barbara. It was delicious!! And just a heads up I guess they have a secret menu that we didn't know about. Jessica was so sweet in letting me change our order last minute to cheese fries instead of regular. Also their strawberry lemonade was the best I've ever had!! And for dessert I ordered a chocolate malt which was delish as well! Can't wait to go back and try the teriyaki char burger! :)"}
{"text":"I think the food here is great. Lots of diversity of selections. Delicious shakes, sweet potato fries, burgers and chicken. Been there a couple times and will go again"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place to see why's theres a line out the door. I was told by the order take that it's always busy on Friday's . So I too stood in line for about 5 minutes placed an order for a char burger, no cheese and onion rings plus a coke. I waited another 7 -10 minutes and my \"buzzer\" went off indicating my order was ready. The young girl at the counter tried to give me cheese burger, french fries and a shake. I told her that was not my order and gave her my receipt she said \"oh, oh okay, said something the the guys cooking and then wrapped up a burger and onion rings and off I go. A few minutes later I  was home and ready to dig into my burger, only to find that I had a cheese burger with bacon and barbq sauce, tomato,mayo,pickle and UGG! I hate meat on meat!!!!!!! I took the burger apart to try to eat it and then to top it off, it's not done! still pink !!!!! Great, live and learn if you want a good burger, go to Culvers!! Best burger in town, fast friendly service. I tried to call to speak to the manager but the only number is the \"order taking\" department which is not in the building. Some annoying guy kept saying  \"just tell me what happened and I'll tell the manager to better serve you he can call you back\" I left my number and it's been 3 hours and still no phone call. I realize now the reason the line is out the door is not because the burger is good or at the least the service is accurate but because they charge $2. 58 for a hamburger!"}
{"text":"Ok this place is not like your everyday fast foods. If you want quick good tasty food and not heavy on your wallet,  then this burger joint is the place. They put their own touch to it. It has me coming back over and over again. You want healthy they do it too. Instead of bread wrap it in lettuce. Yeah this is the new and improved. It will become a new habit for you."}
{"text":"Food is incredible! From burgers to the chicken sandwich, you cannot go wrong.
Tried the tempura green beans last week & would choose those over French fries any day of the week and twice on Sundays!
Do be prepared for a wait. Not typical \"fast\" food & can take over 20 minutes when it's busy...but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here with a killer hangover, ordered the double char.. One of the best burgers that I've ever eaten. Everything fresh from the bun to the lettuce and tomato. Delicious I perfectly cooked meat. Great fries too, and they have Powerade at the drink dispenser which was life saving. Will be back soon for sure"}
{"text":"So me and my husband went in 30 minutes before closing on a Saturday night. There was no customers. I thought the employees were going to be upset that we came in before closing , but they were so friendly. The cashier made me feel so welcomed like they actually wanted my business. The food was ready quickly and it was delicious (like always). And they have the best onion rings I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says there are times were you want a specific burger spot and The Habit is up there with the big dawgs. I am so happy Vegas finally has a Habit finally. There burgers are simple and hits the spot every time. Let's just put it this way I'd rather go here then smash burger, Bachi burger, or ketchup (which is the bomb but way overpriced). Habit grill is part of the trifecta of best burger spots innout, habit, and then fatburger. Habit is proof that there is a God. Try the double char burger with bacon or any burger with avocado and do onion rings. Boom. Life changer!"}
{"text":"took a while to get and the burger was just OK, i had In N out like expectations that were not met.
the salad was really good thou..."}
{"text":"Delicious and more than burgers to choose from!  The Tuna steak is fantastic, sesame seed bun, shredded lettuce...  always great!   Nice cozy patio, good customer service too and clean restrooms!"}
{"text":"Best Customer service!  Best burgers!  Great price! Flamingo location.  Will recommend to every one I know!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at this location a couple of days ago. I had the the teriyaki and he had the double charburger. His came with fries and we also ordered onion rings. Both burgers were juicy and flavorful, and the onion rings and fries were crispy. The food is very reasonably priced, providing a nice alternative to fast food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had the basic char burger and I thought the flavor was fabulous. Perfectly cooked   The bun was nicely grilled and condiment s on it didn't overpower the great taste. French fries were just right and hot! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here my first time today, as there char boiled mushroom swiss burger was great. Loved the buns toasted. and there sweet potato fries, Yum! New favorite hamburger joint"}
{"text":"Pretty good, clean restaurant fresh ingredients. Onion rings was on point. Good customer service and they give you extra ranch at no cost."}
{"text":"The cashier and manager insisted that the veggie patty requires an upcharge  because it's more expensive than a beef patty. 

This begs the question - how low quality is their beef if it's cheaper than a black bean burger?"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was hesitant to get something here.. Change my mind and I'm glad I did.. Long story short the food is good well what I had and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Much better than In-N-Out...

- Better menu
- Better tasting burgers
- No ridiculous wait times

Can't wait until they open one of these closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Freezing inside the building and the music is pretty loud in general.  Hard to have a conversation 

Very slow getting the food today. Fries need to be served while they're hot. 

Hopefully they do better next time, as I like that he way the burgers are made with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Veggie burger of awesomeness!   
Amazing customer service, clean place, terrific food!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh...service was fast! The atmosphere is modern, friendly, and clean. We ordered the Santa Barbara with sweet potato fries. Delish!"}
{"text":"Our family ate at this restaurant recently, and we all enjoyed it.  The prices are decent, and the food was great!  The service was pretty fast, and the employees were all very polite.  The milkshakes are delicious!  The only negative I can see is there is not very much seating, so it might be hard to find a seat if you go during their busy times."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tasty juicy burgers, awesome shakes! Used to go all the time to the locations in N. California."}
{"text":"Located between Bahama Breeze & McCormick on the north side of Flamingo. Directly next door to Panera. Jamba Juice & Pieology are also there. 

Parking is limited so be prepared to walk if you can't find a space. I entered through the back from Howard Hughes & there was very little parking on the backside. Entering from westbound Flamingo puts you right in the car park. 

They serve 2 combo meals: #1 is a burger/fries/drink; #2 is a double decker burger/fries/drink. Burgers come with lettuce, tomato, mayo, carmelized onion & pickle rounds. Cheese is extra. I ordered a #1 with cheese, no mayo/onion for $8. 

Everything else is a la carte. In addition to burgers, they serve veggie burgers & salads. 

Fries were great. Nicely salted. Served in those trays like In & Out. Hot, not burnt or overdone. 

The burger: definitely fresh, nice charbroiled flavor. Reminded me of Carl, Jrs. but better. It was piled nicely with the toppings & wrapped nicely. It's a nice sized burger & hit the spot. Not greasy or slimey at all. 

Everything is cooked to order & you're given a pager. When it flashes you pick up your food from the expediter who confirms your order before giving it to you. 

It was very busy during noon lunch hour. Everyone working was nice & friendly. The tables inside were packed & the outside tables were open...probably due to the chilly weather. 

I don't care for this area of town due to traffic & construction & proximity to the Strip so I'll probably never go back. However, the food was quite good. If they opened in other areas of town away from crazy Strip traffic I would eat there."}
{"text":"Heard about the hype so decided to try it with some friends one day for lunch. The place was packed! The burgers had a nice flavor with a good selection of toppings to make it different. The onion rings were very good. The staff was excellent and during the busy lunch they had a guy out on the floor cleaning tables and making sure every one had what they needed, impressive. Ordering with 2 the lines was a bit chaotic the day I went, but hopefully that will work itself out."}
{"text":"Best Burger and Sandwich place. 
I came for the Charburger, but fell in love with the Sandwich. -Fresh Albacore sandwich and a side of sweet potato fries! 

Service was awesome! A friendly associate opened the door and welcomed me right away. My order was taken in just a few quick minutes. Got my food soon after."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great ambiance, and very pleasant staff.  But, cannot request how may is cooked. All is well done."}
{"text":"One of the things I love about Habit is the consistency in food quality from one store to the next. I have eaten at all 3 locations and they're all the same. 

I also can't get over how clean they are. Henderson's dining area is by far the largest of the 3. It's not cramped like the Flamingo location or just \"large enough\" like Blue Diamond."}
{"text":"Just switched from in and out burger. More meat to bun ratio.  

Friendly staff

Better chili bar

Better selection. 

Dump in and out"}
{"text":"Fresh, not greasy. The burgers are char grilled so they taste like a typical burger at a barbecue. I ordered the teriyaki pineapple burger and it was excellent. Another time at another location I had the chicken and sour dough sandwich and that was amazing! My only complaint is the lack of seating so we got it to go. A busy place must be a good sign just wished we had a place to sit."}
{"text":"UPDATE:
Corporate got in touch with me about my review and invited me back. It was very pleasant and my order was perfect! Thank you for the great service! We look forward to coming in again!



This location is the absolute worst. The employees really couldn't careless! I ordered a cheeseburger on sourdough bread and I got the most confused look on the persons face that was taking my order. I also asked for my lettuce and tomato on the side with some of the spicy mustard sauce on the side as well. From the befuddled look on her face I should have checked my bag before I left but I left out of there in a hurry to get back to work. 
Imagine my surprise when I opened my bag to find NOTHING on the side like I asked for, even more surprising the burger was plain on a regular bun, not the sourdough I asked for.  I'm done and I've told coworkers about my experience, I'm sure they won't be in anymore either."}
{"text":"Not as busy as the one off Flamingo. Food just as yummy here as there. Staff very friendly & stayed on top of keeping drinks station & tables tidy & clean."}
{"text":"found this place in Santa Barbara, CA.  really good burgers there.  Now that they've branched out I can get really good burgers here."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, I passed by and it smelled really good so I decided to stop by. I decided to go through the drive through and that's when I made the biggest mistake of my life. Three cars in front of me and it was a 40 minute wait!!!! Are you kidding me???? I thought to myself shit what are they doing chasing the cow??? This burger better taste hella good. But no it wasn't, it was a waste of my money. It was too over priced and not worth it! I rather have in and out then this shit! Not only that they didn't even have my order ready and tried to give me a meal I didn't order! Very disorganized!!! So I'm a very disappointed customer and will be boycotting the habit, please take the time to read my review and do not go! Then again that's my opinion and how my experience went"}
{"text":"We love their teriyaki char!! A sliced pineapple is grilled and this reminds me of home. Also fan of other sandwiches as well. We go there quite often:D"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best fries ever!  The food is always fresh and hot.  Love the new Caprese sandwich and garlic fries.  Sometimes I just stop by for a fry fix!  The staff is always so friendly and the restaurant clean.  We recommend The Habit to all our friends."}
{"text":"We love this place. Burgers and salads are fantastic, the fries are to die for, and everyone who works here is always so nice"}
{"text":"This is our third visit in about a month.. the staff is always friendly and helpful and each time the food is delicious. I love that they have a tuna filet sandwich. The tempura green beans are to die for.. to the other reviewers that say they wait too long for the food, in their defense the food is really fresh. It's not McDonalds give them a break! I have no issue waiting for freshly prepared food. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are very clean and the manager is great he seems very hands on helping the staff (cleaning tables and helping with the kitchen and register) will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Didnt like any of what me and the gf ordered. 
Everything basically resembled an upgraded Burger King."}
{"text":"Really great burger joint (don't go there nearly enough) Great menu and great options, like having a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.

Never disappointed"}
{"text":"I thought I was being pranked it was such a bad experience. I ordered Santa Barbara style char and garlic fries. Girl taking the order repeated it back and said \"no cheese\", I said \"with American cheese\" (what it comes with). She proceeded to repeat it wrong 3 more times (her: \"no cheese\" , me: \"with American cheese\" etc etc etc). Then she said drink, I said \"no\" and she charged me for a drink on receipt. She said \"fries extra crispy?\" I said no, receipt says extra crispy. My To go order takes 14 minutes (according to running clock above the drive thru window) even though there is just one other family in restaurant. The fries sit on the counter for 11 of those minutes. When I say they are sitting there a long time, the manager snarkily tells me they will still taste good. They are burned and cold. And guess what, NO CHEESE on the burger"}
{"text":"Just to echo what other reviews have said....this place is disgustingly filthy. I would let some dirty tables slide in the middle of a busy shift, but we're talking at 10:30am (right when they open) on a Saturday. It's very obvious the Friday night crew just walks out the door and locks up without cleaning anything, and then the Saturday morning crew comes in and says \"well if they aren't cleaning, why should we have to do it?\" Dirty tables, trash under tables, greasy/sticky floors (the \"wet floors\" signs they have out make me laugh because it's so obvious these floors haven't been wet in weeks), a mess of trash & crumbs on top of the garbage receptacles....I could go on and on. I've visited at opening on a Saturday about 3 times in the past six months and it's always like this, so I'm done trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. (Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure the same greasy handprints have been on the windows every time I visit, too.)"}
{"text":"These hamburgers taste like McDonald's burgers, however, are way overpriced (for the quality). I will not waste my money, here, again. Instead, I'll stick to gourmet burgers like those served at Deluxe or Blue Burger."}
{"text":"OK...this place existed for quite some time before we landed there for our first try.  Now, we've had about a dozen tries + and we like!  Charbroiled burgers and some interesting burger choices, such as teriyaki...also grilled chicken and veggie burgers (not for me!!)...the fries always hot and crispy, the onion rings are quite good as well...they have three unsweetened brewed  tea choices and two of them are very good imo...prices for portion sizes are bargains."}
{"text":"First of all, called order in.  The young lady may have asked me to pay on the phone, I didn't understand her so they apparently just threw the order out and said they never got it....My husband ordered again in the restaurant, no french rolls for the tritip which was tough beyond belief.  His hamburger was undercooked and shouldn't even have been served.  NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Great casual place. Burger was great, I would compare it to a $13-$14 sit down place like red robin but half the price. Area was clean and the staff was friendly. New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I am so happy my daughter and I ate there today!! It was so good!! I like how they cook right in front of me!! Friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"This was a pretty good spot to have lunch the burger came out quick and very fresh I really liked how thick the patty was fries were average and the green beans were salty but over all nice experience"}
{"text":"The burger and fries were good.  i like the grilled onions in it.  I spluged and got the sundae.  It was super yummy!"}
{"text":"That burger joint is good. I get the double char and its the best I will definitely return soon"}
{"text":"Food was great, the girl who took our order was so rude I almost left.

Tempura fried green beans with ranch are amazing. The new green chili burger was awesome! Love the pepper bar!"}
{"text":"I placed an online order from this location on 7/15/17, two salads with added meat. I got home and realized they forgot to put the added chicken on one of the salads. First I tried calling the location, with no success. Unfortunately everything goes through some automation system! :( It directed me to fill out something online that would get processed to the store. I'll be honest I was annoyed at that point.

So I ended up driving back to the location with all the food and explained what was wrong. Jonathan asked me if I wanted a whole new salad or the chicken on the side. I told him what ever is easier for them. He communicated my order behind the line to the cook and I waited on the bench for my order. 

Jonathan then came out and handed me a coupon and explained what I could use it on. I thought about getting a shake so I asked if it was possible to do that. He said he could get me a shake and still keep the coupon for the trouble of having to drive all the way back.

They ended up making me a whole NEW salad and apologized again while they were bagging it up!

Big shout out to this location for fixing an honest mistake and handling it like pros! I understand mistakes happen, but it's nice when places actually show they feel bad about it. So as usual we will continue to frequent this place!"}
{"text":"The habit had always been a great spot to bring the family. While yes it can get a it pricey, especially with the sides and shakes being equally as expensive but the quality is awesome. Almost like a home made burger. It's pretty great and awesome environment"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place today! Great charburger at a great price! Would recommend and will be back. They also have jalapeños available which makes a great addition to your burger."}
{"text":"First I want to say that I have eaten here a lot and have always loved their food BUT on  5/30/2013 I took a friend their for dinner carryout and it was the worst.  I had the Mushroom Swiss burger with Crispy Fries and he had the BBQ Chicken Salad.
1st The salad had all wilted lettuce, little if any tomato and  and the chicken was cold, it looked like they reused it.
2nd The burger was real thin and under cooked, not sure how you can under cook a burger that thin, I have had thicker meat at  McDonald's and the fries were just old and reheated from earlier that night.  We both threw it away.  If we had eaten there I would have sent it all back and said something then.  I will never go back........The only reason that I gave it 1 star is because you have to pick one."}
{"text":"So excited that this new location opened up! I love everything about this place, right down to their fries. Their burgers are phenomenal! I always add bacon and avocado to the double char burger. Defiantly recommend this place. Great location awesome staff! 5 stars all day!"}
{"text":"Habit is an awesome place to get a quick bite to eat. Best part is that there food is freshly made right in front of you. If your in a hurry but you don't want a greasy burger. This is the place for you. Also have assortments of chicken sandwiches and salads as well! There shakes are even better! Place is amazing and the staff is very friendly !"}
{"text":"Food took a while to be ready and once you get it, you see why. Onion rings burned to a crisp. French fries overcooked. Only flavor from the burger came from the mayonnaise I thankfully put on it.

Save your money and go to In 'n Out instead.

Awful."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Very friendly staff. Eat there once and your hooked. Reminds me of the way hamburger stands used to be."}
{"text":"Great experience! I ordered a pineapple teriyaki burger and regular fries. I was pleasantly surprised that my total was $7.50 for the burger, fries, and drink.   Based on the clean, stylish environment, I expected to pay $15.The fries were good but basic.The place is super clean. It's small.... So watch what time you go. They do have a lot of outdoor seating. I'll be back for sure to try their Tri tip sandwich and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Was at this location recently. I've been in here before maybe 2-3 times. Entered a bit before noon and became one of 13 (yes I counted) people waiting in line with 1 cashier. Appeared to be 3 (?) managers/supervisors working behind the counter but no one running the 2nd register. Of course the wait was long and irritating. A young girl was on the register and she seemed to be taking orders at a pretty good clip but no body catches up 13-1 ratio. Would have been pretty easy for a sup/manager to jump on a register and take a couple of orders. It appeared as though their were more managers/supervisors than employees. Too many chiefs not enough indians. Everyone was busy, just not adjusting to things that needed to be taken care of.  

Additionally, the only 2 available tables were not bussed and had food particles on them.

Overall the food is pretty good and it's consistent from one location to the next. But like many others have stated in their reviews here... the service kills the experience."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good burger in this town.  I have my favorites, In-n-Out, as far as a fast food place goes, as well as Fuddrucker's if I'm looking to spend a bit more on a deluxe type of burger.  

I was going to a show at the Hard Rock last week, and wanted to grab a quick bite.  I took a look at all of the new places recently opened @ the Hughes Center on Flamingo/Paradise, and decided to check out The Habit.  This place is great!  Really good food, fairly priced, friendly service, immaculate dining area, everything you'd want in a burger joint.

The menu is pretty large.  Besides the traditional burgers they offer chicken, tuna, veggie, as well as a tri-tip steak sandwich.  There are also 6 kinds of salads, sweet potato fries, tempura green beans, shakes, malts & sundaes, as well as a small kid's menu.

I got the Double Charburger w/cheese combo (with fries & a drink), about $9.  The burgers are cooked when ordered so everything is really fresh.  My burger was excellent, good fries, the drink selection is nice, several different teas, as well as sodas.  

The staff is constantly cleaning the place.  As soon as a party leaves their table, it's wiped down by one of the friendly staff members.  I was very impressed by The Habit, and will definitely make the trip from where I live in Spring Valley back there in the near future."}
{"text":"I have to say my actual experience, was better than the burger. The staff here is awesome. The place was spotless. Also the girl working the register, when she wasnt busy was always doing something. Helped clean, walked around to tables to check on patrons. I found that very impressive. Also the manager seemed like he was very kind to other staff members. Absolutely no one on this staff was just standing around. Everyone was working and staying busy even though it wasnt that busy. Thats a sign of great teamwork. Which i can appreciate as a customer. My burger..pretty good! Tasted fresh and was hot. It was good for the price. Will be back"}
{"text":"Best meal for the money anywhere...period.I can't believe how great the quality is for what you spend...My new go to place for sure.Food is so fresh and perfectly prepared!

Burgers amazing and huge!
Fries amazing 
Salads and dressing are perfect.
Great selection,lots to choose from besides burgers.I can have something different every time I go.

Goodbye In and out,5 guys and all my other faves,this is it."}
{"text":"mehhhh. could be better.

#1.....do you really need 20 employees for 10 customers? I mean, really?! seemed a little over crowded in the back to me. it was nice having good, friendly, fast service. just seemed a little overbearing.

#2.....vegetarians opinion on the veggie burger? boca patties are much better than \"veggie\" patties. those things are nasty! change that and i will come back for sure. otherwise, i will have to think about it. Though I must say I do appreciate you having a vegetarian option and allowing the substitute on any burger! :)

#3.....The fries need a little work.

Thank you, drive thru, please come again! (if you change to boca patties!) ;)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Their food is amazing. Contrary to another reviewer, this place has always been clean.  Maybe visited on a bad day?  Super clean. Always fresh. Customer service is excellent. SERIOUS about this place.  It's delicious. And yes - their ranch is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Service is great loved the green beans, there was really nothing special about the burger"}
{"text":"The food was ok. But the service was great. Everyone was very friendly. I am a sucker for good customer service. The fries were ok. I would go back to try something else but I think I'd go across the way to get fries from Five Guys to supplement :|"}
{"text":"I never thought I would put any burger on the level of Five Guys, however The Habit is every bit as good, especially considering the price! The double char with cheese is right around five dollars, while the same thing at Five Guys will run you close to $8. The burger here IS smaller, but still plenty. 

This specific location is fantastic, the employees are great, and I love the Strawberry lemonade thing they make in house every day. Only negative is that the fries are pedestrian. They were fine, but the second time I just got a burger and skipped the fries. I've heard great things about the sweet potato fries. Not really my thing. 

If you've never had this burger, drop what you're doing and go there now!"}
{"text":"This place has GREAT food at a very reasonable price. I use to go across the street to % guys, however the Habit is now my favorite. The wait to get in is sometimes bad, especially around lunch time, however they get you in quickly."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers and fries, sure it's not cheap like your typical drive-thru fare, but as with anything else, you get what you pay for.  Some of the complaints I read about wait times reek of entitled snowflake'ishness, if all you want is total speed in service then by all means go to your local Molden Starches; you shouldn't mind waiting a few minutes for good quality."}
{"text":"This place is not good. I don't understand why people seem to like it. It is overpriced and the size of the patty is tiny. Half of my burger was bun and veggies only. Everyone should do themselves a favor and skip this place and go to in n out. You will spend less and get more food."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience.  I like going with a group to get a blend of fries and onion rings.   The shakes are hand spun and fresh!   Double Char is the best!!"}
{"text":"Let me just start with my love of peppers..pepperocinni, banana peppers to be exact. These were at the ready in a self serve station near the soda fountain. Delicious burger, bbq bacon burger with fries and a mocha milkshake. The other half had a teriyaki pineapple burger with a superb side of onion rings. Additionally a large iced tea and medium soda. The prices are very reasonable, $21.50. Service and order were quick and efficient though it was during the grand opening and to be expected. I will definitely be back with my teens who I expect will be begging to eat there on a regular. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the patio with misters and umbrellas looked relaxing. Great location, this uptown neighborhood needed some more variety and I like how they revamped the area with all of the various eateries with accessible parking unlike across the way downtown."}
{"text":"Execellent. Clean and delicious.  The double with cheese and onion rings are my favorites.  Best shakes.in henderson."}
{"text":"Two stars because the burger is good and fresh, but the drones behind the counter can't think their way out of a paper bag to provide simple customer service.  My kids can eat a burger, BUT I can't get them apple slices unless I order a kids meal... Then for a glass of water that is not a thimble, $2.10.  Asking about any deviation from the norm had smoke coming out of the drones ears."}
{"text":"Slow service, once you get it lunch is over. Called to inform them, nothing done! Bad Habit!!!"}
{"text":"Third trip, third badly executed order.  Ordered a Tuna Sandwich Rare on Wheat to Go.  Received WELL Done on white roll.  The roll fell apart, the tuna was like the bottom of my Tevas after a trip up Squaw Peak...This will be the final time I go there.  What the heck?"}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight and I'm impressed! I took advantage of the drive thru as I'm 9 months pregnant and getting in and out of a car isn't the greatest lol. But anyway the line was a little bit long but I didn't mind. I ordered the Santa Barbara Char no tomatoes with fries and a Mocha malt and everything was delicious! Most places forget to leave off the tomato and I was so happy even though they were busy they did not mess up. Definitely going to be back soon. Also must add the girl in the drive thru did not make my malt until I pulled up which was great because by the time I got home I did not have a melted shake!"}
{"text":"The service was very nice and very quick.  The burgers were beautiful.   The food was all delicious.   I got the BBQ bacon burger and my wife got the Santa Barbara burger.  This place will definitely become a \"Habit\"."}
{"text":"I stopped to get a salad on the 6th Tuesday evening around 8:15. I have a real diabetic alert service dog, I came in with my dog and got a very dirty look from the oversized girl at the cash register, she practically snickered at me and asked me what do I want. I told her I said salad,\" and what dressing she asked\", I said ranch and bleu cheese. I left there  after I picked up a few more Snickers from her and the manager giving me that look, if you know what I mean while I waited, got home to enjoy my salad, and I get a half of a dressing. Don't know what's going on with a few of these locations, but they better get their management much better. As of two years ago, I loved the place in Tempe, as of now I don't think I will return"}
{"text":"From walking into this place I knew I had made a bad decision and should have gone with my gut and ate at In & out. Always a bad sign to me when you walk into a restaurant and notice at lunch time no one is eating there.  Ordered a #2 with everything on it including \"grilled onions\".  Was handed some dumb buzzer that was pointless since the lady at the counter could see us the only two people in the place to let us know the food was done.  Buzzer rang got my food and bit into some warm raw onions that were told were grilled.  Burger pattie had no flavor, buns seemed store bought from frys dollar breads.  The fries  were the most disappointing of the meal, every salty or no salt couldn't get a happy medium. But the one thing they were consistent was over cooked fries.  Oh and don't forget the terrible music that is radiating with wonderful speaker feedback and dashboard confessional blasting throughout the place."}
{"text":"Joining the list of mediocre hamburger joints claiming to have great food (5 Guys, Smashburger, etc.) The Habit falls right in line.  Nothing spectacular about the food, nothing horrible either.  I ordered the Double Charburger, onion rings and drink which came out to a little over $8.  The service was friendly and fast, but the loud music being pumped into the dining room (Rob Thomas and Jack Johnson, you've got to be kidding me) made me want to change my dine-in order to a carry out order. The burger was made with two thin, dry patties and the onion rings were nearly identical to Carl's Jr.  The Habit is basically a fast food restaurant masquerading as a hip, new burger joint."}
{"text":"So I know 5 stars may seem a little crazy, but the burger was absolutely delicious!!!

My friend and I hit up The Habit tonight a little after 5pm. There was plenty of parking (found a shady spot which was awesome since it was pretty hot), open booths (that were clean), and I didn't have to wait in line (which I absolutely do NOT have patience for...especially when I'm hungry). 

I looked over the menu for a minute and decided on the Double Char combo...when in Rome right? SO happy I went with the Double because the burger was absolutely delicious!!!

THE FOOD:
The burger was hot, juicy, cheesy, cooked to perfection (well done which I emphasized), had a great charbroiled taste, and was topped with fresh veggies and encased in a perfectly toasted sesame seed bun!! 

I went with plain ole' french fries. They were crispy, not overly salted, but just ok. Nothing to write home about. 

My friend got the sweet potato fries, so I was able to steal a few and try them out. They were pretty darn tasty, but I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato fries, nor a connoisseur, so not sure how good they really are compared to others. 

We didn't get a shake or ice cream, but after just the burger and half of my fries, I was stuffed! 

I think next time I'll go with just the burger and get a shake!! Or share an order of fries. They weren't huge like 5 Guys, but they were still a pretty big order, and pretty big french fries. 

THE INSIDE:
The restaurant was clean, had plenty of seating, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and I didn't have to wait long to park, order, or pick up my food. 

I like that they didn't have music blaring on the inside like another burger joint I know *cough*5Guys*cough*. My friend and I were actually able to sit and chit chat without screaming across the table to each other. The inside was pretty modern, clean, industrial looking which was nice. The Habit has a great feel to it overall. 

If there's one complaint I have, it's that the outside seating area faces Glendale, which is fairly busy any time of day, so it gets really noisy. 

THE PRICE:
The price point is fairly reasonable. My total came to around $8 and change for the #2 Double Char Combo with french fries and a drink. Not too shabby. But the a la carte burger prices were pretty decent too. 

THE VERDICT:
Habit cherry popped? Check! And all in all, it was a great first visit!! I'm definitely a new fan, and have already raved (and dreamed, and salivated) about my dericious burger, and keep thinking about the next time I'll have one. Seriously can't wait to go back for more!!!"}

By The Rue

To the blonde worker who took my tray,
You're probably thinking this is gay,
There is so much I wanted to say,
After I considered it I was like no way!
Maybe one day you can come out and play,
I'm much better looking without the light of day. 

Charbroiled burger from the grill,
Lettuce, tomato, onions for the fill,
Filled up the iced tea and didn't spill,
I went with my co worker named Will,
Allanis Morissette sings Jagged Little Pill,
That is one hotty I'd like to drill.

I like that they have the pepper bar,
My office is close and not very far,
Jalapeno and peppercini's not in a jar,
My little brother cut me and left a scar,
I'll bet you like that band named Gwar,
I still drive a jeep and not a car. 

Fries are fresh and they give you a lot,
Onion rings are over breaded but hit the spot,
When I hike I like to jot,
I don't care if it's too cold or too hot,
My favorite color is polka dot,
Can I have your number? No, I cannot.

{"text":"Great burger. Even better green bean fries and ask for ranch.  Save room for the chocolate shake made from real ice cream."}
{"text":"I intended to take a picture of the food to post with this review, but I took one bite and couldn't put it down. We ordered a Double Char Burger, Santa Barbara Cobb Salad, Caesar Side Salad, and a Strawberry Limeade. This place is great. The food was awesome, my favorite being the burger and strawberry limeade. There was a small miscommunication about the order when we went through the drive-thru, and once it was sorted at the window, they ended up giving the limeade complimentary. I would definitely recommend everyone to stop by and try this place out."}
{"text":"I had the seared ahi sandwich and the fried green beans with ranch.  Ahi was good.  The green beans with ranch were awesome."}
{"text":"I loved every single juicy bite!! Blows five guys away and in and out too ill be back"}
{"text":"Tried the Habit a few years back on a work trip to California. Think of in and out yet updated with more menu options. Nice updated, clean place with a good burger. Only issue I had was some times the burgers are medium well, easily fixed if you order well done. Chicken sandwiches are good, the best burger is the Santa Barbara double patty with avacado on a thick toast (not in the print menu but always available). Dont get me started on the fries, best fries in town.I could eat these fries all day, ive stopped just for their fries multiple times."}
{"text":"I always compare any good burger joint to In n Out. I didn't know what to expect since none of my friends ever talked about this place. My first impression when I walked in was wow this place is clean. And it doesn't have the fast food atmosphere like In-N-Out does.
First glance at the menu I was happy, no over priced burger here like other higher end burger joints. And it has pretty extensive menu (can't wait to try on the tuna, chicken and tri tip).
My husband ordered the original char burger and I had the teriyaki burger. We split an onion ring and strawberry malt. We sat down waiting for the order which came out pretty quick. As we took our first bite, we both let out a soft groan of satisfaction. Sorry In-N-Out this burger tastes so much better and I like the fact that I can have pineapple on my burger. The onion rings were so crispy and seasoned just right. And the best part is, neither the burger or the onion ring was greasy. Normally my husband would push the onion rings toward me because they're too greasy. This time I have to fight a little for my fair share. And the malt, oh the malt was deliciously melting in my mouth. 
We just finished eating the food half hour ago, but while writing this review, I can feel my mouth salivating again lol"}
{"text":"It's good but not great. The hoopla is about marketing and not great burgers. I've definitely had better at Wendy's. Not much more to say about it. Smashburger blows it away."}
{"text":"I use to live in Santa Barbara in the early nineties and loved the Habit, so I was super excited to get one here in AZ not horribly far from my house. The first couple times I ate here it was great. However, the last couple of times I have eaten here it has gone downhill big time. From soggy bread to old tasting lettuce, etc. I can't decide if I want to waste even more money trying them again in the future or not....however, their onion rings are some of the best ever.  I hope they improve because we need good burgers in the Arrowhead area. This area is full of fast food, Red Robin and fuddruckers (no idea why they're still around) and five guys is way too expensive for a fast food burger."}
{"text":"Very good. 

I had the tri-tip sandwich on whole wheat while my husband got the double Charburger. We both really enjoyed our meals. For both sandwiches, 1 order of fries, 1 drink and 1 milk shake it came to $17. It was pretty busy but everyone was working hard and kept a smile on their face. Nice Decor and it will be nice to enjoy the patio once it gets a bit cooler. My husband and I are big fans of Culver's so it will be tough to change our favorite fast food burger eatery but Habit came in at a close 2nd! Only complaint....it smelt really bad outside. I am guessing it was the dumpster but it was overwhelmingly smelly. Luckily, the smell of burgers and fries quickly filled the air!"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out dinner online - BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, Santa Barbara Cheeseburger and onion rings.  The service was awesome!  The person at the pickup area knew who I was the second I walked up.  He ordered the onion rings to be made (they wait until you arrive before sides are cooked to retain hotness and freshness), offered me water, condiments and utensils for the minute I waited for the onion rings to be cooked. The food was fresh and delicious, the order was accurate. Knowing there are many choices for burgers in the area, the super customer service and reasonable prices will ensure return visits!"}
{"text":"Love the food every time we are in the area we always stop by for a great burger!! Must check this place out!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys, a negative review, which is sad based on 20 years of the Goleta experience.

You have NO WAY of contacting your store directly. I placed a drive thru order, you screwed it up. I get my receipt to call in and get it remade. Zilch, nada, nothing, no phone number. I found a phone number on Google on my Audi Connect. Picked the option 3 and was immediately told to go to the website and fill out the form, CLICK. The line hangs up on me!

I did not have internet access, so that is just STUPID to ASSUME everyone can just connect to the web. You are a REAL store, providing REAL food, to REAL people, so have a way to contact REAL managers. DUH! How stupid can a company be? 

I called the corporate offices, nope. No help. This is a franchise. Call the franchise owner. How exactly does this get my sandwich remade NOW? It doesn't.

So sad that people running business are so stupid that they think this is customer service. OMG, the manager might have to talk to customers!!! What a concept.

While writing this, the Franchise owner contacted me. It is the corporate offices forcing this system on them. I will contact the Franchise Manager at Corporate, but still this has hurt this local stores reputation. Again, Sad based on the Goleta experience."}
{"text":"Not a huge burger person but when my bf surprised me with a burger for lunch, who says no thanks? Not me. It was awesome! So awesome I returned the next day and tried the veggie burger. Also great! Lettuce wraps are a huge plus. Only minor downside was miscommunication about sauces and cheese. No biggie. Their great customer service made up for it. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today. My husband has been here several times and it is one of his favorite places to grab a burger. I definetly want to try it Santa Barbara style next time. Can't wait to come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Good flavor to the meat but the fries and sandwiches themselves are missing the wow factor that you get from Five Guys. Just a slight step up from In N Out for more money. I give it an overwhelming meh rating."}
{"text":"I was leaving the bank and saw a habit burger sign and thought I would try it... I've heard it was good ....Great burger and fries  went though the drive thru.... ordered a number 2 with  all the fixins and it was great will be going back there so my wife can try it"}
{"text":"Put me on the list as the newest fan of the The Habit Burger Grill!  I've had more than a fair amount of experience eating burgers all over our great county and some of the best have been in small diners or local hole-n-the-wall joints specific to that area.  I've pounded down the burgers at the chain restaurants as well as national & regional fast food places but The Habit Burger Grill has set a hell of a bar that'll be hard to beat now.   

Quick note of how my family & I ended up here;  After a long two days at the ball fields and shopping, it was time for a hearty sit down dinner, we were tired of fast food, and I was hungering for a large steak but every place we went to had a 20 to 45 minute wait onna Tuesday night?!  The hole in my gut, negative blood sugar level, mouth watering aroma of steak was causing a tremendous rage to build by the time we had left the 3rd steak place, the Longhorn and I was thoroughly pissed off.  My wife pointed at the brightly lit Habit Burger Grill and suggested we try it and I was no mood to drive around looking for a another place.

The front was busy but service was quick and the staff was friendly efficient.  I ordered the double char burger, onion rings, fries and chocolate malts while my wife, not the biggest burger fan in the world mind you, picked the Santa Barbara and fried green beans.  I was not too keen on the size of the patties when the food arrived but the flavor and freshness of the meat, vegetables, sauce and seared bun more than amazed me.  The crispness of the fries,onion rings and green beans were a delight with no heavy grease flavors.  The avocado slices on the Santa Barbara burger were perfect & enhanced the overall flavor which was evident as my wife only grudgingly gave me a bite and finished  hers which she normally does not do with burgers.  

The chocolate malts were delicious and my daughter, normally a Culvers custard fan, said she's found a new favorite.

Long winded but wanted to rely what a treat it was to discover this burger grill and all you folks that are blase about the place because you HAVE the choice of Smash, 5 Guys (bleecch), In-N-Out, Whattaburger etc on a weekly/monthly basis,  maybe you ought to refrain for a while and try again.   I'll bet you'll have a change of opinion.."}
{"text":"Ordered in drive thru, polite and helpful customer service but I received wrong Order. Called to check if I could return and receive correct order but no answer. Fries were ok. Shake was good. Burger looked ok but not what I ordered. I'll stick to my usual in n out."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and every time they took forever! Literally ordered one chocolate malt and it took 30 minutes!! This last time was a weeknight at a non-busy hour. Either they don't care or they are just super duper slow. The food isn't worth the wait at all."}
{"text":"YES YES YES YES!!!!
Super fresh food! I got the Albacore with a grilled chicken salad. My boyfriend got the Santa Barbra with fries and onion rings. PERFECTION! Everything was crisp and fresh."}
{"text":"1st time there today for lunch.  I got a original w/out cheese my wife got the same with cheese it came with fries and a med drink (total $15.74)... We told the girl it was our 1st time and placed our order but then we saw they have sweet potato fries and ask if we could change one of ours to have the sweet potato fries she said no that after the order was placed you cannot make any changes. So if you go there make sure you get it right the 1st time. After a little wait we got our togo order and left.... Now to the food... The burgers were ok, nothing that special the patty  was on the dry side, burnt and very salty plus didn't cover the bun (photo bun left no meat). Fries were nothing great.... For the price and quality of food you'd be better off going to McDonald's, Jacks, or In & out and you can change your order."}
{"text":"This place has great diner style burgers. French fries are great also, thick and crispy. It's fast food however it's not the typical burger from a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Their custom built burgers are the best!!  ... You wont find burgers like this at In-n-Out or those other boring chain burger places ... They offer a variety of selections, their chicken sandwich is amazing, even their salads look delicious, (and they have homeade ranch dressing, not that plactic tasting crap in a bottle ranch dressing) also they're veggie burger sandwiches are really good too. ... Give them a try, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"had a mushroom swiss burger...it was ok i think Five Guys has a better mush swiss burger"}
{"text":"We came an hour before closing and they were still very busy. Judging by the reviews here I figured it would be worth the wait. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and onion rings. The chicken was very thin but tasty. My friend had the cheese burger and said it was a little under cooked and bland in taste."}
{"text":"My first visit i got a burger, just ok, but the steak sandwich was the bomb!! And the price for everything is sssooo low, i could notbelieve the prices!! I paid more for onion rings at jack in box!; everything is Char grilled so it definitely taste better also the girls who work there are all very very friendly and professional I definitely will be a regular from now on"}
{"text":"I have been going to Habit for a long time now. They started in California when I lived there. The Tempe location lives up to all of the great experiences I had at their original spot. It is clean and the food is served fresh. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow... A good burger joint from California not named \"In-N-Out\".  Impressive.  The Habit Burger Grill is relatively new in Arizona but I am glad they came out here from Cali.  Definitely worth a try if you're into discovering new burger places to eat and think McDonalds and Burger King is subpar and disgusting."}
{"text":"Great and fast place to get good food. They have great vegetarian burgers and the sweet potato fries are awesome. Also I have heard they have good shakes. Overall a really good place."}
{"text":"Come on...what's the big deal. I mean it's loud, crowded, you can't have a conversation, and your so close to the next person that your sitting by, you smell their dirty unwashed feet, or was that the average burger? The onion rings were good, but please, get a hold of yourself, it's just another flash mob burger joint. NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Im from Arizona ..and they just open a Habit grill near ne..this is the first place i come to when in vegas ..there ..strawbery limade is to die 4....and the pastrami sandwich....MMMMMM..AGHHHHH"}
{"text":"Burgers not particularly noteworthy.  Chicken sandwiches are better, not a good sign for a burger place. Also, I understand the made-to-order concept, but it felt like it was 20 minutes to get our food.  

I'd favor The Strand, In-n-Out, or Smashburger if in the mood for a non-national chain burger."}
{"text":"The Habit Burger is a glorified Carl's Junior with not as many options. Your tastebuds will recognize that this is over priced frozen food even though Habit claims their food is fresh and not frozen. This will not become a Habit for me."}
{"text":"Best burgers I had in the west Valley 
Location is great the service was good. Overall everything was delishhhh burger salads and frys"}
{"text":"love the food here. and everyone  is very friendly.  I go here at least once a week. the burgers are great, chicken is great , the ice cream  is even pretty good. and not that pricey"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing I made an account just to review it I usually live up northwest but came down here to buy some stuff for work. I just noticed this place and stopped by great service and overall great experience the food is one of the best burgers I have ever had"}
{"text":"I always have a pleasant experience when visiting the Habit Burger Grill, the food is excellent, I go primarily for the outstanding burgers, but also love the milkshakes and onion rings, a Double Charburger and Chocolate milkshake is a can't miss proposition. The service is always fast and reliable with a courteous and friendly staff and the establishment is always clean and well kept, 
a real nice alternative to your typical fast food place, that wont break the bank."}
{"text":"Food and service are good.  Was surprised we couldn't find a clean table to sit at. Manager needs to be more organized."}
{"text":"First off I haven't been to the location myself yet, though I did get food there (family brought it home) so can't comment on wait, the staff, decor, all that stuff. 

As for the food, I thought it was good for the price. I had the double Charburger with cheese, which wasn't anything special but that isn't a bad thing. I thought the portion size (burger at least) was good, and everything tasted fresh which is a plus. 

For what it market seems to be, I think it is 4 star quality. It isn't anything that blows me away, but if I find a joint in this type of market that did I would be amazed. I'd say it is about on par with In N Out for me, just different finishing (In N Out has their sauce compared to just the mayo that was on my Double Charburger). 

If you like In N Out, I'd suggest giving Habit a try, I don't think you'll be too disappointed. If you tend to go mostly to BK/McD then you need to go to Habit right away, it will blow those two out of the water (and I love BK now and then)."}
{"text":"Okay burger , good tri tip sandwich , same old fries as anywhere else, but all the food was room temperature I don't know how long ago it was cooked but it was weird."}
{"text":"Our boss was raving about The Habit's burgers & onion rings. Not being a beef eater, I opted to try the Chicken club (minus the bacon) with onion rings. OMG!!! The chicken was grilled to perfection, was seasoned perfectly and was moist and juicy. The onion rings are to die for! My boss wasn't kidding when he said they're the best in Phoenix. I can't wait to go again just to have the onion rings!!"}
{"text":"When I have a craving for a burger once or twice a month and I need it satisfied, this place will be worked into the rotation.  

They clearly have a consistency issue here though.  One reviewer stated their burger was undercooked and mine was overcooked.  I would have traded for the undercooked any day.  That's when you get the moistest tastiest meat.  The burger could have used a little more seasoning but it was still good overall.  The onion rings and french fries were so crispy and delicious!  These alone would have me coming back when I am feeling a cheat day. 

I think this place is a decent value overall.  Habit's combos are fairly priced but I avoid soda like the plague so the a la cart options are for me. For $6.43, I got a double burger and a massive order of onion rings.  At five guys we are almost at $10 for the same meal and I don't think they are that much better.  However, that's for you to decide."}
{"text":"This review is based on many experiences of which forces me to give it one star solely based on service. Over the course of the times we visit, something is wrong with our order 9 of 10 times. Today I received a burger with no meat, and my wife order was incorrect yet again. When person asks for no bun, and gets no burger, I have to question the people that are working there. Most often they are rushing through people like they are too busy to do their one job, take the correct order. When they repeat it the order back, it's barely understandable because they talk so fast or their accent is so strong. I won't be going there again. Too bad because the burger is good, just not worth it and I've been burned so many times by them."}
{"text":"Never again! I give this place -3 stars. One, for leaving the meat completely raw red. Second, the burger fell apart in my hands. Third, I found a thick black hair in my already shit*y burger. Worst place in all of the land. Such a waste of honorable time!"}
{"text":"Burgers are one of the hot new food trends, and burger places are popping up all over the place.  Between Five Guys, Smashburger and The Habit, my vote and my money would definitely go to The Habit.  First of all, their prices are so much more reasonable than any of the either places, you can get a burger and fries or onion rings for around $7, while just a burger can be that much or more at Five Guys.

The interior is bright and clean, and the service was fast.  My cheeseburger was juicy and the toppings were fresh, and I am a big fan of their onion rings!  I also like the fact that they have other things on the menu, the shrimp burger looks intriguing!

For a quick lunch that is easy on the wallet, The Habit is a good choice."}
{"text":"Burgers were good. Sweet potato fries were nice & crunchy. Got my burger lettuce wrapped. No long line or wait when we went."}
{"text":"The burgers are far superior to In and Out and the fries and onion rings rock. For the price you will never find a better burger. Shake Shack has no chance up against The Habit"}
{"text":"Best burgers hands down! I ordered the char burger and added cheese and bacon.  Also instead of fries I ordered the onion rings. The onion rings are soooo delicious! Burgers are made fresh. Oh and don't forget to get the strawberry limeade. It is a bit pricey but so worth it."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite burgers in town. Staff are very friendly and service is always quick. 

My favorite is a bacon cheese burger with avocado. They have great sides too. Fries are pretty typical, but well done and the tempura green beans are just delicious!

They have burger alternatives as well, such as veggie burger, chicken, and tuna, but I've never tried any of them so I can't speak to their quality. They also have a variety of salads, but I've not had those either. I just mention that in case you're looking for a place with vegetarian options.

Not cheap, but not terribly expensive either. 

Great burger joint!"}
{"text":"Golden chicken salad was very good but a bit heavy on the dressing.  Fairly generous amount of chicken. No bits of lettuce with rotten parts. Fries were also fresh and tasty with malt vinegar splash."}
{"text":"Another good burger joint.  Lean and no gmo. their lemonade with strawberry is pretty tangy. Recommend to dine in or take out"}
{"text":"Consistent, affordable, lunch go to!  The service is fast, food hot and fresh.  The restaurant is clean and the employees go out of their way to be accommodating.  From getting us extra ice tea to more jalapenos, they are super great!  My coworkers RAVE about their salads."}
{"text":"Well I have to say, this place is good.  Tucked away in the corner of the shopping center but has a drive through.   Very good food, great service and reasonable price."}
{"text":"We are from Ventura County CA and only in town for a few days. Spotted The Habit and everyone silently agreed this was the place. 

The food was what we expected the dining area was not. It was very cool: Booths. 

Yeah, nice cozy dining as you don't want that double char getting cold on the way to the hotel. In SoCal most of The Habits have the high tables and half booths. The setup here was cool. Inviting. 

We will be back next time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a burger, don't waste your time with the burgers on the strip. Just a mile or so east of the strip is this little place I happened upon by accident. I was heading to the place next door, but they were out of soup (no biggie, it happens). So my husband and I were trying to figure out where to go and since it was next door we said what the heck and walked in. I was completely surprised with their cheap prices and the burgers have an amazing flavor. The onion rings are light and crispy ( just as they should be). 
Definitely my place for burgers from now on!!!! Thanks for the yummy goodness."}
{"text":"I eat here often because it is very close to my house. I must say the food is actually pretty good. Their burgers are Cooked good and their onion rings are amazing. Probably the crispiest onion rings I have ever had. Do try to avoid lunch time hours as they get really busy!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, however, i dont know if the owners are cheap or what but both this and the PV mall location are outrageously hot like the AC doesnt work.
Additionally, this Glendale and 7th St location reeks like rotten eggs or sewage backup. Both issues are totally fixable so please, please fox them."}
{"text":"It's hard to rate this place because I love it! Since I can't have wheat, their lettuce burger is perfect.

THE PROBLEM: My husband has ordered three different times and every single time his order is incorrect. I don't even want to attempt to go back. He has even specifically told them to pay attention because he wants this place to work for us AND THEY SCREW UP THE ORDER AGAIN.

Updated: we have been in twice since I wrote the original review and the order was perfect each time. Yea!!!!"}
{"text":"If they get your order correct, you'll love this place. They have great burgers.  Unfortunately in my experience they rarely do.  Last 3 times I've had items missing or put on that shouldn't have been. 

Too many good burger joints around to keep hoping."}
{"text":"I have to say I am not much of a burger girl, but my grandson is and this place wows! him.  He is very fussy bout burgers but loves that they are chargrilled.  So I tried one.  This one, with a nice slice of cheddar cheese and hatch green chilis was great!  I tried the chipotle sauce on the side and wasn't much impressed by that...tooo tomatoey....but still homemade and tasty."}
{"text":"A  friend from work and I decided to go check it out.  I had the cobb salad with chicken which I thought was very good especially for a fast food place. My iced tea tasted a little funky, but I'm a little weird about my iced tea. My friend had a single char burger meal.  The single patty was quite small and thin, and she said it was \"just a burger\" nothing special.  Not much seating, and kind of a weird traffic flow inside.  I felt a little like frogger trying to get my food tray when it was up."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place.  We went on a Saturday around 3pm and were surprised that they had a steady crowded.  We had the cheeseburger with some extras and really enjoyed it.  The onion rings were a big hit...nice and crunchy.  The hamburgers had a wonderful charbroiled taste.   
We enjoy having a nice burger and The Habit Burger Grill has moved to the top of our list...edging our Five Guys...:)   Try it we don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Habit Burger many times in California. Disappointed that the service here was poor and the lobby was dirty. Couldn't find a clean table and the floor was disgusting. Employees were chatting but not attending the lobby. The burger and salad were okay but my fried green beans were cold on the inside and they were very salty. Also wasn't offered ranch for the green beans. Should have kept driving to In-N-Out on the next block. 
Not making this location a Habit!"}
{"text":"Glad they opened this up in the west valley. Pretty good burgers. Love their fries and onion rings too. Burgers taste fresh."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this burger shop! BUT I was pretty disappointed with how my wrapper was soak in wet and it made my bread so soggy. But on the flip side if that wasn't the case it would of been a great burger. I believe in second chances so I will try it one more time."}
{"text":"I took my sisters, their kids and mine and order their burgers.  Their burgers were awesome!  My whole family loved it!"}
{"text":"Good and cheap. Not great and I'd rather pay a but more for food that doesn't rate frozen from a bag. Try Lenny's burger for a great cheap burger with a homemade taste. 

The dining area was way too small. We waited for 10 minutes for a table to open up. The one upside was the service was really good."}
{"text":"In town for business. Didn't get a chance to eat all day, when I finally did it was quite late. Stopped here. Severs were very polite. Good burgers, great fries and onion rings. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Yum!! The grilled tuna sandwich is amazing. I passed on the teriyaki sauce and the tarter sauce. Honestly, this sandwich didn't need either. My husband had the double cheeseburger, fries and a chocolate malt. He said it was fresh and tasty. The counter help was friendly and courteous.  We will definitely be repeat customers"}
{"text":"This spot is popular and always busy. The team is smiley and friendly. The place is clean and the food is great. The parking here sucks, cause EVERYONE is here!! I don't come here very often but it's an indulgence when I do."}
{"text":"wow what a nice find in chandler. the burger was wonderful and the menu has all kinds of good things..and the prices were not high. it beat a wendy's burger by a mile.  friendly staff ..can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great burger, loved the sweet potato fries. I'll definitely be eating here again next time in town. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place for burgers. My favorite is the Santa Barbara - Double Char with Cheese & Avocado on Grilled Sourdough. Not a big burger fan, but this is the place I go to when I want a burger."}
{"text":"ok.. First off this place serves frozen food.  How on earth can you charge that much for frozen food?  2nd the slogan of the restaurant is something about amazing quality... I live for good food so when i saw the sign i rushed in!  What a bummer.. Might as well eat mcdonalds because its the exact same thing they just cook when you order at this place.

Dont waste your money eating here.  The people who rated this 5 stars clearly were high when they ate there.


... I just wrote the above review and had to edit my review just to come back and say... yuck.  I have a bad taste in my mouth from thinking about this place and am still bitter of the false advertising of quality food.  I wouldnt eat here if someone paid me.  Un believable.  2 stars only because the soda was good. 

WHY do you serve frozen french fries?????  My taste buds packed up and went on strike after eating here."}
{"text":"First time at Habit Burgers. The burgers were out of this world. We liked the onion rings. They were good and crunchy. The sweet potato fries were rather tasteless. Their staff is very friendly. Enjoyed the visit."}
{"text":"My first time eating here.  The food was pretty tasty!  The burgers and buns were fresh and we loved the sweet potato fries!!  They have a kids menu too that kids would approve! My kids did!  Very affordable place to eat!"}
{"text":"First of all great service and food at this location. Food is fresh made to order and the staff always ensure your order is correct before completing your order. Considering similar establishments the value for what you pay is great. The santa Barbara style burger especially is one of my personal favorites on their menu.

I don't really understand the negative reviews posted here as the habit is a great go to for consistent great tasting quick food. Seeing as the place recently opened you are going to have a few people that need training up as the staff matures into their roles. I haven't had a bad experience the several times I have been here though."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger in town. My favorite was in and out and now The Habit burger is number 1. Great prices and many choices on the menu to choose from. Very clean, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fast efficient and wonderful service. I didn't want whip cream on my milkshake and they gave me a new one for free. So I had two for one! Really nice guys. They make the fries fresh"}
{"text":"I love their burgers as well as their story! I have been to their flagship location in Santa Barbara, California and was thrilled to find out we were getting one in Arizona! I like that they offer chicken & tri-tip sandwiches too, as an alternative to their burgers. But my favorite item on the menu has to be their sweet potato fries, Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place. The burgers are delicious. I have tried their Char-burgers, Tri-tip steak and chicken steak Sandwiches. They are very good.

The place is very clean and you can expect some wait time during lunch but nothing extreme. They get the food very fast."}
{"text":"In the mood for a great burger? Look no further! This place is where to get your burger fix in Tempe. Whenever I am craving a burger I go here. The service is so fast and friendly but the food is phenomenal! Treat yo self and the get the Santa Fe Burger. It's awesome and very filling! I can't speak highly enough about this place. Even when they messed  up my boyfriend's order they had fixed within minutes."}
{"text":"Most people that know me might think of me as a walking, talking slab of Grade A beef - and they might not be wrong if the saying \"you are what you eat\" is atleast a bit true.

I personally like to think of myself as a burger connoisseur and when I don't want to spend $25 on a delicious piece of heaven at Holsteins I head to the Habit Grill!

From what I've gathered this is a chain burger joint that comes to us from California and offers a somewhat limited menu.   Don't let the menu part turn you off - nothing is as limiting as In N Out and look how successful they are.

As of now I've tried almost every burger on their menu and have yet to be disappointed.  They do have a few sandwiches/ melts on the menu along with salads.

Don't get me wrong - as an American we probably have the worst eating habits in the world but let's be real here - none of us think \"man I can't wait to eat a double cheeseburger but right after I smash this side salad\". In short - I don't agree with burger places selling salads but hey!  we all know how important organic, low carb, gluten free vegan options are.

Back to the burger review - definitely a must try and a great alternate to 5 Guy's and In N Out!"}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed burger connosuier, I first went into the habit after receiving a coupon for a free burger and really enjoyed it. I got the regular fries and a coke. The fries were great and the Coke was just right. Today I couldn't help but go back. I got a double charburger with cheese and bacon. It was outstanding! The Bacon was crisp, The lettuce tasted fresh, the cheese was, well, cheesy. The onions really add a nice flavor. I am very impressed so far with the quality of food and will be back. Soon."}
{"text":"Wow, arrived 5 minutes before close and employees were very nice and helpful, just great service. Ordered a Santa Barbara Burger that was cooked and dressed perfectly. Don't be fooled with the $15-$20 boutique burgers. The Habit is a very good burger at a good price. In N out is up there but if you want a bigger menu with more choices and a char burger, this is the best. The employees here a very attentive and the cook tonight made one of the best burgers I ever had at a Habit!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious (some of the best burgers you can get in AZ), the customer service is top notch. They take responsibility for mistakes and make sure your experience along with your food is great. Awesome family atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! It's so much better than in-n-out. BY FAR. (I love their veggie burger) Service is super friendly and sweet it gives a really good vibe! It makes me want to eat there instead of getting to-go."}
{"text":"Great food! A different kind of burger place that offers various menu items at a great price as an alternative to basic burgers. All around good and definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Best burger shake fries and onion rings. Fresh food. Friendly service. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Overall a great place, good food. Only giving 4 stars because the last time we went, we ordered food to eat there and they gave it to us to go and the burger was upside down in the bag. Not like top bun on the bottom and bottom bun on top, like buns in the middle and patty with condiments on the outside. Not sure how that happens, but still good nonetheless."}
{"text":"We love The Habit. Delicious burgers and fries! Service is always wonderful and fast. We live in NM so whenever we drive through Arizona it's a must to stop here!"}
{"text":"We were able to walk in and straight up to counter to order. Our first time there and the staff was super helpful with choosing what to order. The interior was clean and had plenty of seating (we went on a Saturday afternoon). Awesome burgers and fabulous green bean fries! Sauce was delicious for each! Will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"So it looks like there's enough reviews to realize this isn't like other habit locations. Yet I have a story that is just unsanitary and down right wrong.   I'm from California and Habit in my small town is just as popular as In n Out and I honestly prefer Habit in those instances. So, obviously I'm excited to get my burger! Me and my boyfriend order, mine came out pretty decent, I mean I couldn't complain. My boyfriend ordered the Santa Barbara style and a few bites he in looks at me and says \"where's the avocado?\" So I just reach over and pry it open with my hands and there's no avocado. No biggie right? They'll just make a new one.   So I politely walk over, tell the girl at the front \"there's no avocado\" she quickly grabs the half eaten sandwich and gives it to one of the \"chefs\" and slaps avocado on it and gives it right back. SHE GAVE ME A HALF EATEN SANDWICH THAT 3 PEOPLE HAVE TOUCHED WITH THEIR HANDS BACK! Yes, three. She reached over and checked the sandwich too! Four if you count the chef I guess. She took our plate, which she has no idea what we've done with, into the kitchen area where it should be sanitary and sterile. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! If you go to a buffet, even the nasty ones, you never take your dirty plate up to where all the other food is. You get a NEW ONE.   Anyways, the only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the male manager that I spoke to was very nice. He's a little clueless but a genuinely nice person and he made us a new sandwich."}
{"text":"Found out at home our to go order was not what we ordered. Called in and asked to speak with mgr. Manager was too busy to take our call and they asked to return our call which never happened. Food is good but service is not."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, great ambiance, friendly employees, the ranch is okay. The onion rings are to die for, what I call a good burger."}
{"text":"I went here after long day at work.  Wanted to grab something and go, but didnt want drive thru fast food.  The place was crowded and played loud music.  Clean bright and staff was friendly.  Ordered the Santa Fe, fries and onion rings.   Told them it was to go and I was given a restaurant tablet that signals when ur food is ready (I don't know what to call that thing that vibrates and lights up when ur table is ready).  The best thing that I ordered was the onion rings.  The French fries had that dried out cheap diner feel.  The sandwich left alot to be desired.  The beef was low quality and the bread was toasted/fried with butter and oil.  The overall thing was a wet soggy mess.  I didn't eat the entire thing and ended up throwing it away.  I was hoping for a nice grilled quality beef hamburger and instead had a small step above a $1 McDonald's patty.  Either way in a pinch I would be back....I just know now what to expect however Will keep looking for my go-to burger place."}
{"text":"Very good burger! I've had the burger with the toasted bread and it was good. It's always busy there, and the staff is friendly and it's clean. I do recommend."}
{"text":"Cobb salad lovers go elsewhere!  Can't find the right combination of words to tersely describe how disappointing it was.  It fails on too many points.  Good thing I ordered fries or else 1 star."}
{"text":"Habit burger.  Take out order. Did not include the frys that came with the #1. I repeated my order 3 times. Still you forgot. Order#65 at 2:23p   I paid $27.46.  You owe me! This is the new location near 103rd ave and west McDowell     Drive thru. Just want the fries."}
{"text":"Good friendly service and great burgers too. What else is there to say. Customized  my burger with no complaints."}
{"text":"Very good tri-tip sandwich. They always seem to be out of stock on something. Been there three times and they've never had all the ingredients for vanilla malts."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  This was a particularly good night.  Santa Barbara Burger and deep fried green beans.  Somebody pinch me.  Worth the visit.  I usually order the fish sandwich, which is the bomb done medium rare.  Went outside the box this time.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Usually order the Charburger with avocado and cheese, it tastes so auhmazing!!! Better than In n Out people!!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars for the onion rings and strawberry-limeade.   The charburger wasn't bad and a decent price but wouldn't come here just for the burgers."}
{"text":"Provides what it is , a good burger, good fries, good salad. Staff is friendly , but too loud and monotone to my liking but that's probably because I am not an American"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Excellent Malta. Fast friendly service"}
{"text":"First time here. We had the cheeseburger, very good better than in and out.   

The ahi sandwich it too was good and fairly priced.    

The tri tip sandwich it was also very good.          

The regular French fries and sweet potatoes they were also really good.   

My favorite was the tempura green beans they were surprisingly very good.  

We will defiantly be back ,the staff was also very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I'm not one to sugar coat it, this is getting two stars instead of zero because they have amazing brewed unsweetened green tea. The burger was just \"meh\" at best as the only way they say that they can cook it is medium well. It was tough & dry but covered with everything but the kitchen sink. They also neglected to put in the order for my sweet potato fries, the gal apologized and said she would bring them but never did.  Fail. 
I wouldn't bother with this place again personally..."}
{"text":"This is based on this location.  Every other one I have been to especially the Guadalupe location is always great.  I've been here in the past and it is generally ok.  Food is either cold or order is incorrect.  Today my biggest issues were food and customer service.  I had the golden chicken sandwich and it was overcooked and dry.  All of our fries were cold and looked like they were old and tossed back into the fryer.  I didn't bother to mention anything to anyone because nobody seemed engaged with the customers.  I will stick to the other locations.  This was after 3pm so it was 4 of us and 2-3 others, so no excuse in trying to cut corners or tame a rush."}
{"text":"If you love sweet potato fries, then this place is the spot! From fancy local business restaurants to cheaper chain-restaurants (that scarcely carry sweet potato fries), this is the only place that has consistently perfected the crisp recipe of the fry. My absolute favorite whenever I'm craving sweet potato fries. 

Even places that do carry sweet potato fries, they contain salt, and/or too much grease! Also a lot of places manage to BURN the sweet potato fries):! 

However, I am a lover of these fries. So crisp and fresh and cooked just perfectly EVERY TIME. Their grilled chicken salads are amazing and cut FRESH too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I try to come here at least once a week. 

1. Burgers are amazing. Way better than in and out and that is coming from someone born in California. You can tell they put effort in making them. Buns are toasted perfectly and meat is charred just right. 

2. Everyone is nice there. Staff always looking out for you. 

3. The place is exceptionally clean. Both inside and patio is always clean. 

There isn't much more that I can say other than I feel like it's a royal flush. Skipping all the busy ness of in and out for a better quality burger!"}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE!! From the Santa Barbara burger to the fries to the handmade shakes...this place is a definite must! The atmosphere is laid back cool and extremely clean. Also, they have a chile bar if you love to add the extra heat to your meal! Fabulous fresh brewed flavored teas are my favorite too! Give this place a try, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Excited to try this new burger place close to my house and I'm glad it didn't disappoint...Burgers were tasty and fresh. It did just open a few weeks ago so the place still looks very clean and new. 

We ordered the regular Charburger with cheese  with comes with pickle, tomato, lettuce and grilled onions. We also ordered a Santa Barbara Style Charburger which is a double Charburger with avocado on a grilled sourdough. Very big burger!!! The fries were a little disappointing though. They were good but nothing too special about them. We also ordered a chicken finger kids meal which comes with a drink, fries and a little bit of burger jelly bean fruit snack. Kid loved it! But that was expected of a 3yr old. 

The staff were friendly and attentive. I saw a few table finish before us and there was someone cleaning and wiping the table right away. 

Price point is on the higher end of \"fast food type\" burgers but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a standard burger. A lot better than a fast food joint. It was so busy when we went that it was hard to find a place to sit. I had a #2 and I would say it's comparable to Inn n Out."}
{"text":"Speechless the grilled chicken salad is the BOMB!!!! With a side of their delicious tempura green beans yumm!!! OHHHHHH and their awesome chili pepper bar this place is the best, everyone is always making sure you are doing great and make you feel comfortable. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT forget to try their tasty limemade its the best !!!!!"}
{"text":"For the price the quality is sub-par.  The fries are McDs quality, the bun is as well.  The meat is above McDs.  I would much rather hit 5 guys or Smash.....and in-n-out.  If i were to name one burger joint that it was comparable to is maybe Culvers, fast food slightly higher than a McDs or BK."}
{"text":"Nice menu selection from burgers, chicken, fish and tri-tip sandwiches.  Everything is cooked to order.  The burgers and sandwiches are always perfectly cooked and seasoned. The fries and onion rings are crispy and not oily.  I recommend trying the tempura green beans.  

The prices are very reasonable and the restaurant is very clean.  Definitely one of the best fast food burger places."}
{"text":"First time trying Habit Burger.  The drive thru is a little awkward and not the fastest but the food is really good.  I don't know if it was because we were really hungry or it's that great but we liked it better than in n out.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered online and picked up.  The place was spotless and the employees are friendly.  I got the Santa Barbara burger and my husband got the BBQ bacon minus the BBQ and added mushroom.  The burgers were really good and I love that I was able to get 1/2 sweet potatoes fries and 1/2 onion rings and my husband got 1/2 fries and 1/2 tempura green beans.  Way better than fast food."}
{"text":"Burger not good at all. Onion Rings cold. As I was waiting for my to go order, three people came back to the counter with mistakes on their orders. Would rather have the Circle K back that was torn down."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Very tender and juicy, with a tasty resemblance to those of In-N-Out burgers, minus the sauce. The size of the burgers are just right, so you get that bang for your buck. The onion rings are awesome as well, in fact the coating on it is almost sweet - something I've never tried before."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have a juicy and extremely tasty burger! This is the west coast version of in and out but way better than in and out. Go give it a try you will not be unhappy"}
{"text":"Recently tried this new Habit Burger in Gilbert (also our first time trying restaurant as a whole). We had 5 people in our party. Ordering was incredibly difficult, and took forever, then they had an issue with the register and had to move us over to another one...and go through the long difficult process of placing our order again. 

When our food was ready, which it was in a pretty short time given how busy the place was, it was not correct. 3 of our 5 burgers were made incorrectly, the 4th had a very soggy bun. Our fries were not fresh or hot. Sadly no one in our group finished a single meal, and not because we were full either. 

Needless to say, our family will not be making a \"habit\" of coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Figured we would give this place a try based on all the reviews and hype it has received. Unfortunately, by the end of our meal we could not see what the hype was about. We were a party of 4 ; 3 of us ordered burgers and 1 ordered a steak sandwich, fries, green beans and shakes were also ordered so basically we tried about everything. 

**** **** **** ****

SERVICE ... quick, knowledgeable and friendly. Easily accommodated customization of our order without difficulty. 

DINING ROOM ... large, decor is nice with beach themed water colored painting. We were there post lunch rush at 2:00p on a Sunday and over half the tables sat un-bussed, and floors unswept. 

HAMBURGER ... are good sized and the lettuce, tomato and pickles were of good quality and quite hardy in portion, which is good because there is nothing worse then a single thin, hot piece of lettuce and over ripe, see through tomato!

The patties were a BIG disappointment and not at all what I expected for a place with such high reviews. Patties are pre-formed and manufactured \"perfectly\", unnecessarily thick 'seemingly just because' and not flavorful.  The color reminded me of a typical burger you would find in the frozen food department or perhaps a diner or cafeteria. Mass manufactured appearance. 

STEAK SANDWICH ... thin steak, again good fresh condiments with buttery roll. 

MILKSHAKE ... decent size, flavorful and cold.  Made with soft serve ice cream. 

FRIES ... standard cute, crispy. Portion was acceptable; all around decent but not remarkable. 

TEMPURA GREEN BEANS... good sized beans, tempura coated well but was not light in texture, seasoned well and portion was good. 

All in all, it was underwhelming and frankly just \"MEH\" -- Therefore, we will keep trying other places and will probably not go back."}
{"text":"One of the better boutique burger joints out there. Very simple and limited menu, ingredients were very fresh, and there was no excessive wait-certainly not long enough to necessitate a pager system, a la Outback or some other more sit down kind of place.

My girl likes the onion rings-the fries were good, but nothing to stand out. The shake was OK, but small for the price.

I'll go again if I am in that area, but I wouldn't drive across town for it."}
{"text":"Updating simply to let people know (especially when ordering \"to go\" orders)  to just make sure you check the order before you go... got my usual (again) portabella burger with veggie patty, but with extra pickles and grilled onions but did not come out that way. Did also order the fried green beans (which i ate there) and they were pretty tasty.  Asked for toppings that were missing on the burger on the side so i could add and eat the burger later (joys of being pregnant) and once adding them, (the way i originally wanted it), the burger was very good.  Just, make sure you check your order before you leave if you're not dining in. :)"}
{"text":"Burgers are good but the service is SO SLOW and the lines are always so long.  Food is inconsistent also.  Every visit they are out of something from their menu.  Last visit they were out of avocado.  :(  And that's one of the main reasons I choose there to get a burger.

To me, at a minimum, a restaurant should have all of their menu items in stock at all times.  I won't go back, there are plenty of other burger places that also provide good customer service."}
{"text":"Arrived just before the lunch crowd, greeted by a smiling cashier eager with her favourites, as well with follow up suggestions. Staff was buzzing handling the steady flow of people growing in the queue. While there try that tasty lemonade, you'll go back for the free refill!"}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of my favorite meal which is a BBQ Bacon Charburger and  Onion Rings with ranch dressing. Always YUUUMMMMY!!!!"}
{"text":"What stood out most was the very friendly staff. I was blown away by the customer service one one of their employees who even offered to take my tray for me when I was finished! Their lobby was very clean and the food was very good! I will defiantly go back!"}
{"text":"The burgers are AMAZING and taste just like as if I bbqd them myself. However... their fries are horrible!!!! So greasy bleh. This is common when you throw the potatoes into the fryer and the oil is not hot enough... they are nasty... if I could find a place that have these burgers and the same kinda fries as in n out burger..ahem hand sliced potatoes..not frozen.. I would  be so happy... I even tried to dab them with paper towels but that grease was saturated into the potato.. yuk. Their burgers are so gosh darn good tho... ugh. It's better to order just a salad instead of ANY kind of fries they have."}
{"text":"This place ranks way  above 5 Guys, Burger King & Carl's (which is cardboard on a bun) and certainly Mc Donalds.  The prices are very reasonable.  I'm sure they will increase after this new location has been open for a couple of months.    Have tried it twice and will return.   For the price the quality if fine.  The owners invested quit a bit to build out the place from the old previous Ulta layout.     On our last visit, it was packed with a waiting line of 10.    Everyone was working quickly to get all of the orders out.   I hope they continue to do well and maintain the quality of the food and the service."}
{"text":"I was confused by the cheap price of the burger on the menu and then the amount I paid when all was said and done. Holy Hannah! It seemed so affordable but I ended up paying more then I meant to. Things just added up quickly....

As far as the burger it was pretty good. I am not entirely sure what was on the charburger but I enjoyed it.  It had mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion on it. I guess the nice flavor was the combo of the grill and the fact that the onions are caramelized (according to the online website I just looked at). The sweet potato fries were awesome and nice to have with a fast food burger.

I think now that I know the prices I won't be so unpleasantly surprised by the price when I go next time."}
{"text":"The place was clean, the staff is good, Gabby took my order, she was polite and professional. The food was great; fries were fresh and crispy, burger was cooked just right, juicy and full of flavor. Nice place overall and great location."}
{"text":"For a Monday evening for dinner this place was steady busy. Very clean, everywhere as well....inside and out! 
First time here, we ordered char bbq bacon burger and tri tip steak sandwich with sweet pot. fries and onion rings with 2 mocha malts for dessert.
WOW! The food was amazing, cooked exactly to order. Especially the tri-tip had a REAL piece of steak, not just shavings as it usually goes elsewhere. 
The service was so friendly and helpful too!
We will definitely be back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is worth going to based on the tempura green beans alone! But the burgers were very good as well. Sort of non descript but delicious. Includes all the stuff a burger should have and the price is great too. Definitely will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"I like going to the habit for the good food and great prices.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place. Had to check it out myself. Good burger choices. My burger came out sloppy. The tomatoes were soggy and wet the bread like masa.  Don't like the line set up"}
{"text":"I love The Habit!! All the food is so good. It is our go to place. Every burger/sandwich is amazing. The shakes are delicious. And my favorite is the fried green beans!!"}
{"text":"Only been through the drive-thru so can't comment on dining experience however, food presentation, quality and taste were outstanding. Had to wait a little long but given the summary above, it's worth the wait.  Highly recommend and definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Went here last Wednesday took my family we all had free charburger coupons that we got in emails due to a march promotion they have going on anyway  I ordered & was waiting for my food I overheard the cashier talking to the other cashier she rudely says what's with all these free charburger coupons the other girl says it's a promotion and the first girl says I hate when they have them then we have to deal with all these people trying to get something for nothing I was very offended because I didn't just go for free burgers I also ordered fries & drinks & why send these emails out if they don't like honoring them very disappointed with my visit don't think I'll be going back to that location  ."}
{"text":"1st time at Habit. Double Char/Fries/Green Beans. The Flame grilling makes the diff. Great Fries, puts 5gys, I&O, Smshbrgr to shame. G/B terrific.  Don't smell/feel like grease like you do after 5gys. No cult crowds like I&O. Decor similar to Smsh, but better burgers.  My ratings: 1) Habit 2)Smsh 3) 5gys 4) I&0."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good fast food place to eat. It is always clean and the staff are friendly. Love the condiment bar as well!"}
{"text":"exalte burgers really good service  overall restroom was really clean! best food i've had in my whole entire life!!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, but our burger was VERY dry:( On another note, Salad was good!"}
{"text":"Went Saturday and Sunday. The tempura green bean fries are so good. And both burgers I tried were great!"}
{"text":"Burger was ok, but nothing to write home about. I'd rather have in n out, 5 guys, smash, fat, or shake shack. And the place is hot and stuffy!  They need to ventilate it, or at least turn the friggen AC on!  I'd recommend smash burger about 1/4 mile east of here over this place."}
{"text":"My first visit was pretty good, I went with my son for dinner on a Saturday night. Almost every table was filled. We ended up getting burger combo meals (single w/ cheese for me, double w/ cheese for him). We substituted onion rings for the fries. Those were pretty crispy/well done and they come with ranch dressing. The burgers themselves were pretty good, nothing really memorable about them though. Just seemed like your everyday, run of the mill type burger. We'll probably be back if we come up this way."}
{"text":"Just tried this place the other day & fell in love w/ it!  We tried the teriyaki burgers w/ swiss that were soooo delicious w/ sweet potato fries that were pretty good & some onion rings w/ ranch, that were perfectly crisp & way yummy.  Portion sizes were excellent, not overwhelming but not too chauncey either.  We washed it down w/ some sweet strawberry/limeade & a green tea.  My son had the kid's meal w/ a good size char burger w/ cheese, packaged apple slices, which tasted kinda nasty (apples were a little soft & had an artificial taste to it) & a milk.  My son was super happy w/ the lil hamburger gummy that they give w/ the kid's meal, lol.  Its fast casual w/ limited seating & super cheap.  Our total was ~$23."}
{"text":"So. Good. Front counter service was a little iffy, but that's expected for a new restaurant. The staff hasn't found their groove yet. But the burger was absolutely devine. Ordered the habit burger meal - burger was seasoned perfectly and fries were warm, salty and crunchy. Atmosphere was fun and family friendly"}
{"text":"Love this place. First tried them in Covina CA and now they moved to my neighborhood.  Couldn't be happier. Great food nice people. Welcome and keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I personally was a little disappointed in this burger joint. I felt like the burger could have been a little more flavorful but it was still very good. I loved the caramelized onions & the toasted bun but the overall burger wasn't my favorite. I just expected a little more. Maybe next time I will try a salad here. Their salads look amazing."}
{"text":"A nice change from casino buffets. The charburger is always a great value, tasty and like everything else here made to order. Clean and comfortable restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok Habit Burger makes a unique Tasty Burger so Simply put ....it's difficult to Compare to In and out ...Quick note you must tell them to put Onion on Burger....I just said with everything and no Onion was result....Fries are fresh and crispy....burgers are charbroiled which adds a smokey flavor quite different from In N out....Overall good Quality"}
{"text":"Sadly, not nearly as infatuated as I was originally with this place.  This is not the place for you if you have any qualms at all about too much soy in your diet.  You will NOT find ANYTHING to eat here. I mean, they really are obsessed with soybean oil here!   
So, I was disappointed to find out their fries are cooked in it, & actually every single one of their sides.  OK, I thought maybe I would just get a side salad to go with my burger...NOPE...soybean oil all around in every single dressing. How about getting a yummy milkshake to go with my meal, I thought?  But alas, I noticed the shakes suspiciously named \"Frozen Treats\"...no mention of ice cream which I kinda consider a key ingredient in a shake. But, upon inquiring, sure enough, no lack of SOY though.  Their shakes sure enough LOOK just like real ice cream milkshakes, but just not real sure exactly what is in this menu item they tout as \"Handmade Frozen Treats\".   
Wow, just not a fan of this cheap, overused oil drenching every single item in my meal.  Sorry, Habit Burger, I would much rather spend my fast food bucks at places that use peanut oil for frying, healthful olive oil in the dressings, & all real ice cream/milk in their shakes."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually regular the Habit in PV because they are amazing and so quick. This location is not the same. We've come twice now and it's literally been 20 minutes or longer in the drive through line. A little unacceptable I think. 2 stars because the burgers are yummy but that's about it."}
{"text":"Parking for lunch is a nightmare on a weekday. 15 minutes later, I finally found parking on the street behind the whole complex. Food was fine, but I think five guys and in and out are better. Price is good, service was quick, and food was hot."}
{"text":"Ok, I do not see what all the hoopla is about.  The burger was better than fast food but inferior to Smash or Five Guys.  I was not impressed at all. Went during a normal lunch hour and service was average. Not bad, just normal.

Again, not a fan of this place, hard to understand what the deal is with this one."}
{"text":"I now know why it's called \"The Habit.\" Very good burgers. The coal burgers are very fresh and tasty. Additionally, there's an assortment of sauces they offer to top your orders. I've loved In-N-Out Burger for years, and this is the first time I've had burgers comparable to, if not better than INO."}
{"text":"I think out of all the new burger joint chains that have recently popped up this is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic burger.  I like it more than In and Out. Had the regular cheeseburger.  Was delicious and ordered a second.  Soft serve wasn't that sweet."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Ventura County I am so glad
that there is A Habit out here. And it has a drive though ."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there 2 weeks ago...as I am a recent transplant from OC, CA  I was familiar with the menu.
Everything was good, as expected.
Service a little too slow but I'm not complaining, as food came out good!"}
{"text":"Oy Vey!  White American cheese, tomato, caramelized onions, mayo, and mustard on a pastrami?

 Which 4 condiments are a sacrilege here?

 Dear, departed uncle Solly is a-rollin' in his grave."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT PLACE to eat the burgers are fresh made and JUICY, crud are AMAZING!  Staff is friendly! I always love going back. I prefer the habit over McDonald's or Burger king. I would recommend The Habit to everyone"}
{"text":"Give it 2 stars because the food was good but it's ridiculous to wait 30 minutes for 2 cheeseburgers, fries and onion rings. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has become A HABIT... I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE.  The grilled chicken sandwich on wheat bun , no cheese but everything else and grilled onions. Side of sweet potato fries and your set.  Blows Fat Burger out of the water. Prices are great too. Promise you all will love"}
{"text":"This place has become a habit!!  Their grilled chicken sandwich on wheat bun and grilled onions is to die for.  I can't get enough of this place . And don't forget the sweet potato French fries ( onion rings rock too).  Love love love this place"}
{"text":"Great lunch , good burgers . Had BBQ bacon burger and Caesar salad . Very fast and efficient . We come here every couple weeks , and I try something new each time ."}
{"text":"We are repeat customers. Today's visit was disappointing. My wife's burger wasn't fully cooked. The fries didn't seem to be fully cooked either. They were crispy on the outside but hard on the inside. I'm not an expert on cooking fries so I don't know what causes that. 
The place was clean and friendly. Service was fast, but would have waited a little longer if that's what is needed. We will come back because we have been pleased in the past. Hopefully our experience this visit will be isolated."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great onion rings and fries. You have to pay extra for cheese but it's worth it. Fast friendly service! Only downfall, they're so busy seating is limited."}
{"text":"For a fast food burger place, this one is pretty good.  We each ordered the cheese burger and french fries and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food.  Burgers were very moist and flavorful and the fries were good too.  The quality of the burgers were superior to the \"hockey pucks\" we had at one of those gourmet burger places.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"fairly typical quick serve burger joint. In the vein of In & Out or Five Guys. Overall, pretty good. Quick line, good burger, and crispy fries. Would go again."}
{"text":"*Food allergy alert* If you don't care about food restrictions, skip this review :)

Unfortunately, I can't base my review of this restaurant on the quality of the food, because I couldn't eat any of it! However, I was very disappointed by the response of the staff to my very basic questions, as they seemed to have no idea what was in any of the food they served.

When I arrived, I asked the person at the register if she could guide me toward what options are safe for someone with celiac, and explained this means I can't eat wheat/gluten. She stated she didn't know what that meant, but would ask the manager. Fair enough, I'm pretty used to having to speak with a manager or chef. I'm also generally well informed, and knew going in that any of the fried items were off-limits (they fry breaded things as well as french fries, so not safe), but was mainly trying to find out which of their salad dressings might be safe for me. They also have lettuce-wrapped burgers, which should be fairly safe depending on any sauces you might put on them. The manager came over, and clearly had no idea what he was talking about. He had no understanding what gluten is (repeatedly confusing it with dairy), and said that everything they served was gluten, \"The burgers are gluten, the bun is gluten, the cheese is gluten, the salads are gluten, everything.\" Even though I can read labels myself and was mainly just trying to get an allergen info sheet from him (which most chains have available), it wasn't worth the risk to get anything to eat there. I'm really surprised at the level of ignorance the staff had regarding pretty basic questions, and when I looked up the allergen list available online, there are plenty of items that are GF, so this just shows that the staff there is poorly trained. If you run a restaurant, I think it's a basic responsibility to know what is in the food you serve, and failing that, know where you keep the allergen sheet- which EVERY chain has. 

If food restrictions are an issue for you, I'd recommend going down the way a little to In-n-Out, where despite it being a fast food restaurant, they are far better informed about the products they are selling."}
{"text":"I had high hopes but found the whole experience lacking.  Order at the counter and they hand you a pager. The burgers had little flavor and for the price I didn't think it a value. Plenty of tavern burger places with a better atmosphere and flavor."}
{"text":"Discovered this place last week and have already been back for more. Their burgers are terrific and our new favorite. The fried green beans were awesome!"}
{"text":"I wanted to see what all the buzz was about and am always game for a new burger place. I just found the burger to be average and didn't care for the shredded lettuce. I like whole pieces of lettuce in my burger. The service seemed fine. For now, I'm sticking with In & Out. Can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through last night (3/24/2017) by accident - WANTED to order from The Noodle Company and thought that THEIR \"Drive Through\" was there - but found out that it was for The Habit instead - so we thought \"Why Not?\"

So we ordered a single and a double hamburger combo each with fries and a drink - Food was below average, Prices were way high.......

Needless to say - we won't be returning for any future business......

Too bad - they've got a great looking location - but the food and the prices SUCK"}
{"text":"so good. in the PV area you have In-N-Out, Five Guys, Culver's and the Habit. I love In-N-Out for a cheap burger but if you want to take it up a notch The Habit is awesome. The char burger meat is so good. The onion rings are really good, some of the best. The only annoying part is you pay for cheese and bacon. I expect to pay for bacon but paying for cheese is kinda messed up. They should just include it on the burger for no extra cost. Regardless I still dig the burger. Best one around PV mall area."}
{"text":"The food here is tasty. Great prices and the employees are so helpful and friendly. Everything is fresh."}
{"text":"the burger industry is a competitive one, especially in this town. but this place has great burgers, which I would compare to in n out. 

they also have a kids menu and other items to choose from, if burgers aren't your thing. 

only issue is that the location is small, so finding a seat can be tricky on a busy evening. and it's never fun to get your tray of food and have no place to sit. 

enjoyed my first visit - and will return."}
{"text":"Seriously a really delicious burger. The tri-tip sandwich was not good but that burger deserves six stars!!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place... Went with my mom and sister through the drive-thru ... Ordered 3 #1's , got to the window, paid the $24 and saw the girl putting 3 burgers and 2 fries in a bag (we hadn't even paid yet), just missing that last fry, so we waited.... And waited... Watching our three burgers and two fries sit waiting for the last of the 3 fries to be done. 20 minutes from the time stamp on our receipt we get the complete order. So we had 3 cold burgers, 2 cold fries and one piping hot fry straight out of the fryer. 
Not one person even came close to the drive thru window while we waited... I was looking forward to that burger, maybe I'll try another time."}
{"text":"First time here last Friday. They cook to order so the wait might be a bit longer than you're used to at a burger joint. The line was to the door and they even give you a pager to alert you when your order is ready. 

The place is clean and modern but somewhat small and seating was at a premium at lunch time when I went. Parking is also at a premium as in the norm in central corridor. 

The food was good and the service friendly and would definitely consider it again when in the area."}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwich good sweet potato fries good green bean fries and good service always a pleasure"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I feel compelled today because the cost of this food is to high for what you get. The tri-tip sandwich was the worst sandwich I've ever tried to consume. The meat has absolutely NO flavor, it doesn't even appear to be seasoned with S&P! A tri-tip sandwich should have a flavorful piece of meat with some sort of aioli, not boring mayo. My daughter said the only good thing about the albacore tuna sandwich was the sauce. I'm giving it 2 stars because at least the strawberry limeade is decent. Habit, a little seasoning goes a long  way!"}
{"text":"Tried the double char cheeseburger today. 
It might as well have been the In & Out Double Double, it was that close.
The onion rings are nice and unboring though.
Fast friendly service, nice place to sit and eat.
Avoid the lunch hour line if you're gonna give this place a try.

No WOW factor about this burger at all, I think I should've ordered the Santa Barbara which has avocado and sourdough -- it would've been an improvement.
There are a lot of better burger places in the valley including my standby----
Whopper with no lettuce, extra tomatoes, extra onions, and put some BBQ sauce on the bottom bun."}
{"text":"Living in Gilbert we are without a decent burger joint.  In and Out is terrible and BurgerFi and Zinburger were absolute jokes.  I've never heard of these guys so I thought I would check them out.  As for the burger, it was OK, a step or two above Wendy's, but nothing that blew my socks off. I could stand going back were it not for the following:  

Cleanliness
I know they've only been opened a month or two, but their cleanliness was not up to par. There is no excuse for overflowing trash and dirty restrooms.  I don't care how busy you are, your employees need to be on top of this (see photos).  It's disgusting and ruins your appetite.    

Cashier
The girl who waited on us was a disaster, I think these people believe they're already a cultural mainstay in Gilbert the way she rattled off all the fixings before I could even finish my sentence.  I know it's \"cool\" to talk as fast as the Micro Machines guy from the 80s, but slow your roll honey.  Your establishment hasn't earned the Soup Nazi attitude you think it has.  Also, I ordered a #1 combo and the girl looked at me and said, \"Do you want fries and a drink with that?\"  I responded with, \"Doesn't that come with a #1 combo?\".  She said, \"Yes, but we still have to ask\".  I thought that was self explanatory when ordering a combo, and told her that, to which she looked at me with bewildered confusion.  Mind blown.........

Soda
This is nitpicking, I know, but I love a soda with my burger and fries.  For the love of god, please have someone from Coke come and fix your mixture, it was terribly off. 

Design
Whoever designed this place obviously had no idea what they were doing.  If your sitting at the community table and there's more than two people in line for a drink, it's uncomfortable having someone literally touching you as you sit an eat.  Not sure why they couldn't have found a better place to put the drink fountain.  And get the rid of that worthless planter in the middle of the lobby, put in more seats.  

Seats
As for seats, sadly, there aren't enough if you plan on eating anytime Monday through Sunday, 11:00 - 2:00.  Too many squatters.  My advice, if you decide to go, get a seat first, then order.  Otherwise you'll be waiting with your food in hand, getting cold, like I had to do, while waiting for a place to sit.

Wanted to love this place, but just can't."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 3 stars. You have to order everything separately including the cheese! I would have thought the cheese would be included in their \"famous\" burger but I was wrong. Customer service was very friendly. Their onion rings were pretty good, I rather get their onion rings than the fries. No lie, if you're craving a burger you can easily make them at home exactly like this place. Overall customer service & onion rings were good but the burger and fries were okay."}
{"text":"The Habit has yet to become a habit with me. I have come here a few times when visiting Phoenix, and while I have enjoyed the mushroom Swiss charburger and love their onion rings (their fries are okay), I have yet to feel drawn enough to make this place a regular destination. I do have one general question about the new gourmet burger fad: if you make a burger so large and stuff it with so many different things that you cannot fit it into your mouth, is it still a burger (given that a burger is supposedly a type of sandwich)? Still, their charburgers are good and served at a good price, and I do aim to come here one day to check out their veggie burger, as I like to encourage restaurants to offer some type of veggie burger option."}
{"text":"Meh.

The Habit Burger Grill didn't knock my socks off but it wasn't bad.  This burger joint is quite average.  I had the BBQ Bacon Charburger combo that came with fries and a drink.  The fries were decent but nothing special.  Standard fast food fries.  The burger was good but nothing to write home about.

Wait staff was friendly and the restaurant (and the bathroom) was clean.  A woman was out and about the entire time I was there picking up trays and sweeping.  I'm not too picky about my surroundings but I appreciate places that keep up on cleanliness.  

My final verdict is 3 stars.  The Habit is not a place I would go out of my way to eat at.  If I was in the area or a guest requested a stop, I would have no issues stopping.  But if I'm going out on my own for a burger in Tempe there's other places I'll hit first."}
{"text":"Walking into this incredibly clean, well-kept restaurant, I was expecting a great dining experience. While the service was top notch & the staff friendly, the main attraction - the hamburger - was a study in mediocrity.  The meat was flavorless, bland and disappointing.

I indulged in a Santa Barbara style burger with bacon, and ALL of the flavor of the sandwich was derived from the toppings & toasted bread. The meat could have been mising entirely,  and the sandwich would probably still taste the same. The avocado that topped the burger seemed fresh, but lacking any flavor or character.

**Take note - this burger includes pickles with the avocado. WORST FLAVOR COMBINATION EVER.**

The bright side of our experience was the onion rings & iced tea, both of which were phenomenal. Seriously some of the best onion rings I've had in Phoenix. Generous portion, great batter, tasty & fried to perfection. The iced tea had a flavor profile that I couldn't identify,  but was complex and refreshing.

If ever forced to return to The Habit, I will get two orders of onion rings & an iced tea.

Hold the burger."}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite lunch spot!! It is so delicious! I grew up having the Habit it SoCal where I'm from, so I'm pretty stoked they put a location here. 
This specific location is incredibly clean. The service is great; the people are so nice! I got their veggie burger with cheese, avocado, and grilled onions. LOOK HOW GORGEOUS SHE IS. Hands down the best veggie burger I've ever had. If you're a vegetarian/vegan, this is the option for you. It was delicious! I recommend your favorite burger,(whatever you get will probably be delicious), the original French fries, and a malt! YUM!!! I can't wait to spend all my money here :')"}
{"text":"Outstanding friendly service, clean restrooms. Cheeseburger better than in n out, probably because of the charbroil. Also had tri tip sandwich and albacore tuna sandwich.
Tempura green bean fries are my new favorite, regular and sweet potato fries are cooked perfectly crispy, not greasy, fresh and hot. Just the way I like it!
Three different kinds of fresh brewed iced tea. My only compliant is they are too far away from us. Please open another location in the southwest area. Thank you for opening in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite burger joints. Staff is always friendly. Burgers are tasty and quite reasonably priced!  Why have a McDonalds burger when you can have a burger at the habit for the same price."}
{"text":"My first time and I loved it. I had the tuna sandwich on grilled sourdough bread and it was divine. The side was a standard side salad, no biggie.  But the sandwich was filling and so delicious. Flavorful. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I love The Habit. When I moved from Orange County California I missed the Habit. When my wife found the one near UNLV and the strip I was excited to get a good burger and some amazing hospitality. When the one on Blue Diamond opened up we ate there as well. Now that the one on Stephanie is open we go there and eat since it's the closest one. I love their food. I love the service. It's an amazing place for good fresh food. Also try the strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! The burgers & fries were delicious!! Also I ordered the seasonal salad ~ it was so good it looked just like the picture and tasted better than l expected!!"}
{"text":"I love this chain. We used to come very often  to their location in Upland, CA. And charburgers there were mind-blowing.  So, I was a bit scared to try my favorite burger, cause I didn't want to get disappointed. Especially after I saw the reviews here left by other people. 
At the end of the day, everything was as good. The only thing I'd like to point out for the management, the music was a bit too loud. Otherwise it was great."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a charbroiled taste burger, this place makes it really good. You can taste the charcoal grill taste in their patties. I've tried their regular two patties burger with sweet potato fries as well as their regular fries. I wasn't too impressed with their sweet potatoes fries. Even my dog didn't like it (he eats anything). Maybe the batch I got wasn't fresh. Their regular fries were not too bad though. I also tried their house-made strawberry limeade and it was too sweet with a hint of bitterness aftertaste from the lime. I can't complain about their burgers. It's pretty much the same as Carl's JR."}
{"text":"The best onion rings I've had in awhile. I also got the Santa Barbra double burger on sourdough, and let me tell you! Amazing. Glad I took a step out of my burger comfort zone and tried something new. The customer service was great and the place is vey neat/clean."}
{"text":"Solid food and reaosnable prices.  I'm not sure how long Five Guys will last with Habit across the street.  Habit offers a higher quality burger at a much more reasonable costs and I don't feel like I need to go see a doctor as soon as I leave this place."}
{"text":"Okay the burger was good the service at the counter friendly BUT THEN IT GOT BIZARRE...Listen I understand striving to improve customer service...but this employee came over while we were eating and asked us if everything was good, WE said yes and then she just stood there looking at us and making us feel uncomfortable..THEN she asked what we ordered...okay so WTF we said burgers and then she stood glaring at us with a smile again...Hey if there are any bodies discovered around this Habit Burger Grill you may want to check out the psycho that works there. CREEPY! of course if the manager insist that is what she is suppose to do then get a new manager!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great service and food!! Always get the double chat burger wrapped in lettuce love the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Yum- great place to grab a bite! I had been going to The Habit in Santa Barbara, CA and was so happy to see it come to AZ. Consistently good, freshly made, the wait can be lengthy though since everything's fresh. Even if there are only a couple people ahead of me, I usually end up waiting 15-20 minutes easy for to-go.  I've tried almost everything- there isn't a bad thing on the menu- also their sweet potato fries are yummers. They have great ranch and teriyaki too. :-)"}
{"text":"It's a decent burger, not many healthy options when you actually go to their website and look at the nutritional info, but hey, if you're up for a good burger, it's worth it. Not as cheap as Mc Donalds, but much better quality so I'd say it was worth the price. Not my favorite burger joint in town, but I'd go back if I were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Super good! Came after we did our tough mudder. Just what we needed. Hopefully they will expand to Summerlin area"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not amazing.  Better than Wendys... I had the double chargrilled combo with fries."}
{"text":"Great food.  Menu changed so I posted new pic but like my son said , \"mom worth every penny!\""}
{"text":"Ohh Emm Gee! This Double Charbee was like totally  the best burger in Las Vegas, in the northwestern coordinates pertaining to the store on Decatur.  My friend Steve who just won the Wynn classic for 61k* said he was going, so I hopped on Yelp and looked at the menu. I texted Steve and said \"hey man, I'll take a double Charbee.\" He said \"no problem.\" When Steve got back he pretended that the restaurant was closed and that he didn't have my Charbee but he was just Joshing me(typical Steve). I sunk my canines into the two savory flesh patties and swallowed. Then I was like ..daaayumm son, this Char be's the shitake Yo. I would Mos Def recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fresh and Tasty! Only reason I gave it 4 instead of a 5 was because the buns were a little hard. Compared to other hamburger chains, it's a step above! Friendly and good atmosphere!  Would definitely come back, ate waaaay to many chili peppers which may come back and bite me, literally!"}
{"text":"This Habit lost 2 stars due to the manager on duty (gaby) chastising one of her subordinates (Carla) in front of guests. Carla who assisted me and my family with our order was amazing and friendly provided service with a smile. The food was amazing along with the service Carla provided. It was a shame that my first experience walking in was witnessing a manager being a bully in front of guests."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger with no tomatoes and add avocado which they charged me $1.29 for the avocado. Get home and they had tomato on there and no avocado despite charging me for it. Burger was okay, but nothing special. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"I got the original char burger and it was delicious!! I tried a few of my bfs fries and those were also amazinggggg! The food was ready fast and there was great customer service!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat a burger here. I must say I missed out because I was eating carbless and had to skip the bun and fries. They were beyond happy to lettuce wrap the burger and it was delicious. I had a side salad which was also up to par. I am an avid five guys customer and was thoroughly impressed by Habit."}
{"text":"Love it. The Habit Burger has fresh ingredients an old school made to order style. It's InNOut with more variety and avocados! Personally, I like the Santa Barbara style with unsalted onion rings.

Today 8/6 is a training day so only burgers and fries available. They have multiple charity events coming up where the full menu will be available. Today's charburger came out quick, with lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, mayo, cheese, and avacado. Real cheese that melted off the patty. The fries are square cut and crisp to perfection. 

Service is quick and attentive. :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great food. Customer service was superb and one of the coworkers even brought us napkins . The food is awesome hot and fresh . Would come back here again two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here today.  The young lady at the register was so efficient.  I ordered the Bacon BBQ Burger with sweet potato fries.  My husband ordered the Original Charburger with tempura green beans.  Both our meals came out piping hot and delicious.  We will definitely make this place a habit!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat a lettuce wrap burger. Everything tried has been great. Its premium food but has a fast food feel to it. I try to eat here once a week..  Only thing that is annoying is the cashiers can't keep up when its busy, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"First visit here, Interior is nice new and clean. It's a burger, very similar to In n Out (presentation wise) but not tasting as good lacking pallet luster. It appears larger. Char'd taste is nice. Not overly impressed with food quality, my burger was over cooked and bun kind of dry. Price is reasonable. I will try again in the future with cheese (it's an option $$). Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food is great! This review is based on my drive through experiences. First off this place should not have a drive through. Expect to sit in the drive through for at least 10-15 minutes and that's with little to no other cars. Secondly and MOST ANNOYING is that they have to say EVERY topping that comes on the burger and then they recap it at the end of the order, once you pull up to the window to pay and then once more before they hand you the meal. Habit I know what I ordered and I can on the menu what comes on the burger."}
{"text":"I originally posted a negative review on this restaurant back in November, and the manager immediately contacted me and said steps were being taken to improve the sanitation issues I had mentioned.  Changes were noticed and I have been a regular customer since, although a visit on Saturday (Apr. 28th) will change that again.  As I was eating I witnessed an employee wiping tables with a rag.  Someone behind the counter yelled at him to clean up a mess on the floor so he bent down and wiped up the floor with the same rag.  Then he proceeded to wipe off all the used trays with that same rag and put them back into circulation to be used by the next customers.  I got up to leave and said something to the girl behind the counter about it and she just ignored me.   So I will be ignoring this restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"I do love me some Habit burger. Charburger for life! Their fries, sweet potato or regular, are both great. The location is very convenient right off of Blue Diamond Rd. While I can't speak poorly on the food, their drive thru line takes forever! I've been here 5 times now, three times through the drive-thru and twice inside. I feel like the food comes out much faster when you're inside. That being said.....if you've never been and love hamburgers, you gotta try The Habit!"}
{"text":"Date night with my wife and spent $30 on 2 burgers, 2 shakes, onion rings, and sweet potato fries. None of them outstanding. The onion rings were too greasy and the sweet potato fries too limp. The shakes were fine but very small. And the burgers were just okay. Flavors not too strong but a little too bland. Not a terrible place to get a burger but very expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful. Staff was friendly and sweet. Food came promptly and was delicious. I mean seriously delicious. We ordered #2 double char burger no tomato,  santa barbara no onions or tomatoes, onion rings (were fantastic) and kids meals included chicken nuggets and grilled cheese. All came as ordered no problems. Dessert was vanilla cone and chocolate shake. If you want fancy gourmet burgers go to a restaurant that does that, if you want good old-fashioned fresh food made to order without any fuss this is your place. We paid about $32 for a family of four."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers in town period. Not expensive like five guys and that stuff. It's like $2 more than in-n-out, and 10x the flavor than in-n-out. The charburgers are perfect, and intense with flavor. The tri-tip sandwich is great if u want something different and the green bean tempura will blow your mind. Way addicting. Its a Must try if you're in the area i swear to got"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Santa Barbara where the Habit originated from.  This location was a disappointment.  Now living in Arizona I was excited to see a Habit opening up on the way west side of Phx.  I ordered the Tri-Tip Sandwhich, Teriyaki on the side (i hate soggy bread), and a Teriyaki Char Combo w/ extra raw onion.  Got home, no side of Teri and no extra onion, heck.. no grilled onions that come with the damn burger.  Another thing, the tri-tip had about 4 small pieces of meat.  Any location in the 805 jam packs these sandwiches with Tri-Tip all day long.  Pure disappointment.  2 stars for the friendliness of the employee taking the order.."}
{"text":"The worst burger I have ever had, I would take McDonald's over this place, the bun was soggy and the burger patty was burnt, cold and hard like it had been sitting out on the counter. It was not worth the money you can get a better burger for cheaper and In N Out or McDonald's."}
{"text":"Love these burgers! They have so many options in the menu and you can make your burger however you want. Staff is always friendly the environment is great and the place is always clean! One of my favorite burger joints around!"}
{"text":"Really great burger place. Friendly service, delicious burgers, and very affordable prices. Our first time here. We will definitely come back. Burgers taste char grilled and fresh. Prices comparable to McDonalds for much higher quality."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood! I absolutely love this place! Fast, friendly and clean service!!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here. The fried green beans are tasty and their chocolate milkshakes are darned good. 5 stars for the price point."}
{"text":"This place rocks for great food @ affordable price. Ordered chicken club sandwich that was tasty & juicy. Onion rings ordered as side item was crunchy crispy good.
Washed down meal with MrPibb. 
Highly recommend giving this place a try. Only wish they had locations in Georgia."}
{"text":"First of all I thought this was just a pull up fast food joint with the paper sack that doubled as a tire shiner, instead the inside was modern, the food though rustic and true to its origins was tasty and simple, and there was no drive thru! 

I didnt think I would like that: a burger joint with no drive thru, blasphemous was my initial thought. Then I realized this isnt just a burger joint, its an actual restaurant with seats large glass windows and dedicated staff with relaxed fitting yet matching attire. The kitchen is open a la Chipotle or your local hand cut sushi spot and the atmosphere is very \"chill\" (I havent gotten quite gotten accustomed to the lingo used on this side of the country but Im trying). 

If youre in phoenix do the one on Glendale, if youre in Cali drive five miles from wherever you are now and go to Habit. 

-RIP Tall T"}
{"text":"Guess I don't share most people's enthusiasm about their burger. Place is very friendly and has good customer service though, but their burgers, compared to some of the ones I have had is not even close. You do not pay a special price for their combo \"specials\" as in most places; they are just suggestions to buy several items. Maybe I missed something on their menu, but so far I only tried the Burger; if I go again, I will try something else and see if I find something that lives up to the hype..."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Wrapped in lettuce is the way to go for sure. And the fries, wow. I had to ask where my husband ordered from because it was so good, I couldn't believe it was my first having a burger from The Habit. Puts smash burger to shame."}
{"text":"Good tasting burgers that are freshly made to order. The toppings are adequate and the vegetables are fresh. French fries could have been cooked a bit longer for crispness.  

The space seems a bit small so if you go during busy times you might have to wait for a table. We went at noon and had to pounce on the next available table .

Service was friendly and our order came out fairly quickly.

The cost is very fair. Me and hubby both ordered a meal and the total was only $18!

For a great tasting burger at a reasonable price you really can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"This place was good but not fantastic. If you want an amazing burger go to PV burger! These chains are constantly being hyped (like 5 guys) and they never live up. If you want something original, something extremely tasty, and something affordable go to Paradise Valley Burger! It's local and 100 times better. 

To give a few details the French fries were like Red Robin. The burger similar to 5 guys. The one thing I liked were the peppers available at a little mini \"bar\" off to the side. The place was clean and service quick. Overall pretty good. But not spectacular."}
{"text":"This review is not a hamburger review.  Been there twice and ordered sandwiches both times.

I was very impressed with the friendly service, even after we were seated-as this place is not a wait-service style restaurant.  Food was quick and very fresh.  Once I ordered the Tri-Tip Sandwich on grilled sourdough.  It was excellent!  Tender, flavorful meat.  Second time I ordered the Chicken Club. Nothing spectacular but it was done well.  Sad to say the sweet potato fries were a major disappointment.  Literally zero flavor.  The onion rings were tasty, though.

No, this place does not replace In-n-Out and doesn't even compare in my opinion.  But still a great place to go if you want something fresh and new."}
{"text":"So, I was a little hesitant to try this place.  One, because of the name and two because I just thought it was meat burgers.  That all changed when one of my coworkers told me they had a ridiculous veggie burger.  

The veggie burger comes with honey mustard, cucumbers, sprouts, lettuce, onion and tomato.  I added pickles to mine, cause I love them.  They have a lovely little condiment bar, packed full with items like: jalapenos, pepperoncinis, ketchup, malt  vinegar, A1 sauce and more!  I may or may have used any and all of those items:) The little woman indulged in one of their chocolate milkshakes, which was ok, but I prefer shakes made with chocolate ice cream and not syrup.  The food is pretty cheap and the register gals are very bubbly.  

The only downside is that the closer you get to the bathroom, the more it smells like stinkin' sewage. Bleh. 

Oh, right! They also have beef burgers (duh) and grilled chicken sandwiches and things of that nature for you meat lovin' folks."}
{"text":"The only burger joint where your burger looks BETTER than the picture. Love this place. Not just the same burger over and over, you can dress these things up several different ways. My personal favorite is the mushroom with Swiss cheese. So good. The ranch dressing is excellent as well. The restaurant is clean and the service is courteous and quick. Careful... it might just become a Habit. ;)"}
{"text":"Ahhh bummer. 

My honey and I came in here spur the moment without much research before had. 

I got the veggie burger, which is quite expensive compared to other veggie burgers in the valley.
All sides are extra $ including fries, when you order a burger you're just getting the burger. This would be ok if the burger wasn't already overpriced. 

We were 2 of 6 people inside on a Tuesday night and our food took +15 minutes to be brought to our table. We're both very patient people but it is something to note, this place is fast food... but there is nothing fast about it. 

The workers didn't have a sense of urgency in making the food, which I realized is what took so long two receive two burgers and fries.   

Both my veggie burger and my boyfriends meat burger were subpar. 

It appears The Habit is trying to take on an In-n-Out feel with limited menu options, separate burger and sides, as well as the shakes. However they fail at competing with the swiftness, quality and customer friendly prices In-n-Out offers. 


 I appreciate the veggie burger option in a meat fast food joint but unfortunately we won't be back."}
{"text":"We had their charburger, fries, and vanilla shake. I thought that the charburger was a bit too grill flavored for me. The presentation of the burger was neat, unlike other burger places.  I thought that the fries were   good. The shake was pretty delicious because it tasted like the inside of an orange creamsicle without the bad orange flavor. They also let you have pepperocinnis from their condiment area. I thought that the pepperocinnis tasted a bit like pickles. The service was friendly."}
{"text":"It was like a gormet N and Out Burger!! Yummmy!! I highly recommend you stop by and get one of their burgers!"}
{"text":"First time visiting The Habit - quick review is that I will most certainly return.

Ordered the Double Charburger with onion rings. The staff at the counter was very pleasant and helpful.

Short wait for the burger. It was delicious. The onion rings were a little overdone, but, as it happens, I like them that way, so all was good.

The restaurant was clean and comfortable. In a town full of choices for burgers, The Habit is a place I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'd take this any day over Inn N Out! This is a must stop place for me whenever I go to California. The food is not only great, but also reasonably priced! 
The customer service here is  The owners were there on the first day and always asked us if we were enjoying. The staff behind the register were always smiling despite the hectic lunch hour rush. I was waiting for another part of my order and one of the managers gave me 2 coupons for free burgers to apologize for the wait. 
Will be coming back regularly!"}
{"text":"The Habit Burger and Grill in Gilbert, AZ was so disappointing. The food was cold, it took them 35 minutes to bring us our order.  Then we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the rest of the order that was missing, even though it was stated correctly on the receipt.  This happened to me once before when they opened for the first time... but I gave them a break, figuring they had new employees to train."}
{"text":"Had to try it once I learned they opens in Vegas, after I heard so much a about it. Have to say they lived up to my expectations and beyond. Not only are the sandwiches thick and rich but the friendly staff made the visit even more pleasant. The meat is pretty tasty and fries are perfectly golden crisp and not greasy."}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries are great, the shake was a little thick. I like that you can get whole wheat buns which is always a plus. I have been not super impressed with the take out so just eat in and it will be great!"}
{"text":"We love The Habit in Tempe and were excited to see one built closer to home.  Unfortunately, this location is just not well run.  They are incredibly slow and have screwed up our order every single time we have gone.  This latest trip was the last time we will eat here.  We ordered 1 PLAIN chicken sandwich, 2 Charburgers with everything, 1 Charburger plain, a BBQ Chicken Salad with NO BBQ sauce (dressing on the side instead), and 4 fries.  There was only one car ahead of us in the drive-thru, but it took 30 minutes for them to get our order to us.  They apathetically apologized for the wait, handed us our order, and when we got home, we discovered it was all wrong.  There was everything on both the plain sandwiches and the salad.  I have some dietary restrictions and can't eat BBQ sauce, and my daughters HATE pickles.  There were pickles on everything and my salad was swimming in BBQ sauce.  And there was no dressing on the side for the salad.  We had to go back for the salad and chicken sandwich to be remade--which was a HUGE inconvenience, but the food was otherwise inedible for us.  Lunch cost us $40, and being on a strict budget, eating out is a rare occurrence.  After a 30 minute wait, there should be NO problem making sure the order was made correctly.  We should not have had to drive back to the restaurant, endure a haphazard shrug and an insincere \"sorry\" and wait 15 MORE  minutes for them to remake our items."}
{"text":"A good substitute for your usual fast food!  Their parking lot is too small for the lunch rush (minus one star), but at other times it is fine.

I've tried the burgers, fries, tuna sandwich, and chicken sandwich, and have always been satisfied with my order.  Their teriyaki sauce is actually decent.

Only once have I managed to get them to input in the register and correctly leave off the orange garnish that comes with the tuna sandwich.  I can't do citrus, so that takes off a second star.

The Habbit is a nice \"fast casual\" middle ground between a gourmet burger and Sonic or Wendy's.  I actually prefer them to In-n-Out (better fries), though lack of a drive through makes them less convenient."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  Waited 35 minutes before checking where our burgers were (about 10 of us) and after numerous people arriving after us were getting served. They apparently lost our tickets so they took our receipts.  Then they seemed to have lost the order a couple more times while continuing to serve people after us.  Finally another 20 minutes later we had our food.  The total wait time was 55 minutes.  Horrible service for a semi-fast food restaurant.  I was told by another customer who frequents The Habit that it usually takes about 10 minutes to get a burger.  I would avoid this place at all costs if you're in any type of hurry or have a problem with numerous people coming in after you getting served first."}
{"text":"First time here 
Great customer service and very clean establishment!! Food was pretty good, although my order was still incorrect. The one thing I really enjoyed was the strawberry limeade lemonade!!"}
{"text":"delicious burger. great prices. i especially like that i can order my burger protein style...you know, so i don't feel as guilty when i eat my sweet potato fries. that's right, you heard me. SWEET POTATO FRIES. 

i swear this is the BEST intersection in Tempe. you have Habit, Mac's, Hoodlums, Changing Hands, Sbux,, Trader Joe's and Pei Wei, and Wildflower. What else do you need."}
{"text":"We went here because my husbands work gave him some coupons here. I'm a person of habit no pun intended but I gave a this place a try and it was actually pretty good. My husband had the char burger and I had a grilled chicken sandwich and our kids ate chicken nuggets. Everything tasted really good and fresh and everything was cooked to perfection no over cooked or dry food; and the price was good for what you got. The reason I only gave 4 stars is even though everything tasted good the food seemed like it was missing something!"}
{"text":"My family has eaten here several times in 2015 - 2 adults, 1 teenager, 2 small kids. Usually it costs about $40-45 to feed our family of 5. We live in Mesa and twice we've driven over to Tempe just to eat here.

Items we've ordered: fries, onion rings, the char with cheese and bacon, and mushroom char.

Pros:
-Quick and friendly service!
-They don't charge for ranch
-They haven't messed up our order (we have picky eaters - no onions, no pickles, etc.)
-Quality and price are great
-Onion rings are absolutely delicious every time

Cons:
-Not very many locations

Overall: I prefer to come here than In and Out or Red Robin, but my husband doesn't agree with me. But we'll keep coming to this place when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this place for a lunch burger. The tuna burger and fried chicken sandwich is great as well. Onion rings are great here and they have whole wheat bun option. The fried chicken sandwich might be the best in town BTW"}
{"text":"I was at the habit the other night.  Burgers were good but a little over priced for the atmosphere.  I mean what are they trying to do.?  Restaurant or fast food atmosphere?  To bright I felt like I was trying to relax  but to much fast food atmosphere.  Food was good staff seemed  to rush your order. Like McDonalds.  Let's go casual feeling make place worth the money."}
{"text":"What happened habit you guys used to have the best burgers for the price anywhere and the best customer service recently the service has been down hill the girls at the counter don't really understand what's going on and lately the food seems to be less quality hamburger taste a little grainy remind me of Wendy's maybe it's just new cooks for last month sure hope you guys get it together probably won't be back for a few months maybe then things will be back on track"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to place for Best Quality Fast Food Burger. The restaurant is located on a nice casual spot in the Hughes Center. The menu offers a variety of charburgers, sandwiches, fresh salads, a kids menu, and beverages as in fountain drinks, shakes, and malts. And they have a complimentary Chili Bar that is frequently stock with chili peppers, pepperoncinis, lemons, limes, and jalapenos.

I ordered the Bourbon Golden Chicken Sandwich ($6.99), a Bourbon BBQ-Spiced Fries ($2.50), and a side of Tempura Green Beans ($2.95). The Bourbon Golden Chicken Sandwich is a fried golden crispy chicken breast drizzled with a mild bourbon glaze on a toasted bun with copious amount of shredded lettuce, mayo, two slice of tomatoes, a pickle, and I omitted bacon. The sandwich is very tasty and I like how this restaurant are generous with portions. 

Now the Bourbon BBQ-Spiced Fries are coated with a unique spicy BBQ flavor, it's drizzled with more of that bourbon glaze, and it taste good. Just an FYI, be sure to have napkins ready because eating fries topped with a sweet tangy sauce can be quite a sticky matter. There is one side item that I always enjoy and it's the Tempura Green Beans, which are green beans lightly battered in tempura, and it's deep-fried to a crispy perfection. It is a fun tasty treat dipping fried green beans in ranch. By the way, the service is great! I notice the manager does an excellent job ensuring that every customer's order is delivered in a timely manner and that everything is correct."}
{"text":"I was introduced to habit back home in cali then to my surprise they popped up in lv.. I'm a fan of their bbq bacon burger.been to this location twice however I'm referring to the second visit... I was greeted by jasmin whom worked the register she welcomed me with a huge smile n assisted with great customer service to help complete my order....meal was on pointn hit the spot"}
{"text":"I love the Habit Burger! Fresh ingredients, lots of choices and generous proportions. My favorite is a lettuce wrapped Santa Barbara Char with added bacon. Yum! Char broiled burgers here so no grease. You get more burger here for a much lower price than other establishments. Puts Smashburger to shame. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd try a new burger place. Kept hearing about this one. Was not impressed. Nothing special about the hamburger, was on the thin side. Fries tasted pretty good. Had the strawberry drink, major sugar rush. I'm back to Red Robin."}
{"text":"Leckere Burger (sehr saftiges Fleisch) sowie super Service! Absolut weiterempfehlenswert!"}
{"text":"Was in the area waiting, and decided to give them a try.  Compared to some of the burger places, the prices were nice.  Found the burger to be pretty tasty, especially the grilled onions.  Didn't realize until later that I could have asked for a lettuce wrap or a whole wheat bun (dang small text on menu). Found the fries to be marginal at best.  Assume that they just purchase the pre-done frozen numbers.  They had little to no taste.  I didn't try the shakes, but those suckers were flying out of there while I had diner.  Figure I'll try the onion rings next time."}
{"text":"This is the best Habit in the valley and when it comes to fast food Charburgers like coming here on 7th Ave & McDowell store. The place is clean customer service seems to be high priority!The fries and onion rings are cooked up with your order."}
{"text":"DONT GO HERE!!!!! Went to this place today for time. this is a new place. Just opened this week from what i understand. Well they have a lot to work on. When i walked in the door i noticed the relativly nice decore.  I walked up to the ordering counter and was greeted by the cashier several times even though i already said hello back after the first time she said hi. Then she blurted out \"i can take your order!\" Within the first 30 seconds of me being there. Like come on you are a new resturant and ive never seen your menu before so give me a few. Anyways after my husband and i decided what we wanted we said we were ready and told to wait a moment while she who had so egarly wanted us to rush our dinner decision wwnt and did something else before she could take our order. After finally taking my half of the order she looked at my husband told him the total and never asked if he wanted to order anything. After he paid we took my cup to the drink station where ylwe found standard drink selections along with a \"specialty\" strawberry limeaide with cucumber. We decided to try it and it tasted like a dirty dish rag. So we ended up getting soda and found a place to sit. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. We waited close to 15 minutes for a fully staffed resturant that was mildly busy to make one teriyaki burger and a order of onion rings. The burger was disappointing but the onion rings were good. All in all, i have to say dont go to this place. The customer service sucks and the food is mediocre and slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Their prices have increased, but the drive thru menu prices don't reflect that. Veggie burger is gross, bun and burger overall was very dry and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Originally tried Habit when they catered an event in California and was very excited to find them all around the valley! Firstly, the service is incredible each time I've gone. The restaurant itself is super clean and comfortable. The food is great, fast food prices but tastes like a restaurant's sit-down experience. The charbroiled burgers are fab!"}
{"text":"One of (if not the) best burger in Gilbert!!  There may be a small wait after you order, because it is made to order and not in \"bulk\", like most fast food places are."}
{"text":"I love a good char on my burger and a good char is what you're gonna get at The Habit Grill. It's nothing like In N Out (which I love).  It's nothing like Freddy's (which I also love). It's nothing like Smashburger and it's nothing like Five Guys.  The Habit Grill is in a lane of its own.  I love my burger on the wheat bun because I think it's a sweeter bun. The sweet potato fries, regular fries and onion rings are ALL good.  You can't go wrong with choosing either one of those sides.  The onion rings are my favorite. I also really, really love the peach ginger nectar.  It is absolutely divine. A must try!"}
{"text":"Omg I never had them before until today. I had the double charburger.it was delicious. The meat was juicy and it had the right seasoning i didnt had to add condiments to it. Fries are good. The staff there were nice.. I definitely will want to try other items in the menu"}
{"text":"Ok.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Not much to separate it from any other chain burger joint..."}
{"text":"I just got over here since it was packed the first week.  The place was nice and the girl who took my order was very nice.  The food was only average and I was disappointed.  The burger looked good but it was not flavorful, and I never could have told it was grilled.  The fries were hot but too salty and just average at best.  Great service and clean inside, but I go for the food. Would not go back, In and Out, and Freddy's are way better."}
{"text":"I had is the first time in LA and I actually made it a habit!! I have brought my bodybuilder boyfriend and he had to eat two meals but only because they're very delicious!  We discovered the temperature of battered green beans and they were very good.  Nothing is greasy here! I'm vegetarian so I'm perfectly happy with the veggieburger with the grilled onions!!!"}
{"text":"My experience was good; tasty and fresh. Better than In N Out burger in my opinion. One thing this place has in common with In N Out is its long lines. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes. I'm a patient guy, and don't mind the wait. However, if I'm waiting that long, the food better be fresh and accurate to order. Overall, I had a great experience and enjoy their burgers. Customer service was good too."}
{"text":"I always have a good burger here - whether its a regular or double with cheese to one of their specials.  I just had their new French Onion special and it was pretty tasty.  I also like their salads.

One of the things I like the most about the Habit is that I feel I get a good value.  I can't stand going to Five Guys. Five Guys is a joke.  Not only are their burgers average tasting but it''ll cost you over $10.00 for just a burger and a drink. 

For $7 or 8 dollars, you can get a Double Char, fries and a drink and that's a fair price."}
{"text":"Nice and clean with a comfortable vibe and comfortable furniture. Good tasting burgers. Able to get burgers on options other than bread. Service was on par as well.  I will be returning here!"}
{"text":"The worst experience I've ever had in any restaurant....EVER. service was incredibly slow and when I politely asked the Manager (Lorin) why it was taking so long he snapped at me and said the buzzer would tell me when my food was ready. I explained to him a party of 8 in front of me got their burgers and a party behind me in line had already got their burgers. He again snapped at me and said the buzzed would go off when my order was ready. I advised him I didn't like how he was talking to me and he raises his voice and says if I don't stop yelling he would kick me out of the store. I was having a normal conversation and he made up this lie to bully me. I asked for the name of his boss and he refused to give it to me. I'm a retired cop and have never been so disrespected by anyone in the service industry, especially a manager. Because of how I was treated by this manager I will never go to another Habit Burger again and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Amazing burger! This place is definitely in the same league as in and out. Unfortunately the other location I visited in Vegas on blue diamond is nowhere near as good as this one but that's alright because this place is worth the drive. Everything about the burger was great! Good bun, gooey melted cheese, and a quality Patty"}
{"text":"It's as if this isn't even the same place I've visited on Hughes. The burger tasted completely different. Tasted like I ordered a burger from Burger King. I will never be eating at this location again. Hopefully the new location in Henderson is better. Seriously there is nothing special about the burger here but don't let this location deter you from checking the place out. They have great burgers or at least they did the first time I went to the location on Hughes center"}
{"text":"CA based burger place made its mark in AZ.  First visit and very enjoyable.  Ordered a double burger and a single with avocado, delicious and messy to eat.  Came with grilled onions, tomato and lettuce.  Also tried their tempura fried green beans and sweet potato fries.  This was the best green beans I've ever eaten, nice size order and very tasty.  Also ordered malts.  They were so thick you needed a spoon to slurp them up. Real whipped cream was the topping. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I was very much surprised at this place. I ordered a grilled chicken club and it was outstanding. This is the kind of place that makes you hate fast food chains. For just a couple more bucks, you can have a great meal."}
{"text":"Wouldn't come back, not very customer friendly, go across the street to five guys
The burger was good but scolded when I asked for Swiss cheese, and the French fries aren't Hand cut
Went back to buy dinner for a homeless couple and their dog, asked for a large cup for water for the dog and the girl said no, you have to pay for a large drink to get a cup
REALLY ???"}
{"text":"Tried it out  for the first time last week, Overall would give a 3.5 Both my wife and I found that the burgers were OK, nothing to rush and get again, but the rest of the items we ordered were excellent. We had the fries, onion rings and shakes, would give them all 5 out of 5. Staff very friendly. Saw the other grilled sandwiches they offered looked very good, so will give those a try next time."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the best burger joints I have been to.
The employees are very friendly the customers that were there
the day I visited was disgusting but that's another story.
The food however, was amazing."}
{"text":"Great burger. Very fair price. Very comfortable atmosphere even though it's evencorporate it's kind of cozy, like they're not trying to rush you out.

I'm looking forward to bringing my family here."}
{"text":"Signed up for their emails and received a free cheeseburger coupon. I took the kids for our free burgers and purchased 3 fries. The store was nice and clean but so small we had to sit outside and it was hot! The burgers were good, my 10 yr old said better than in n out, I would praise them that much but definitely better than a typical fast food burger. The 2 regular fries weren't impressive they tasted like frozen fries and the sweet potato fries were good but not amazing but I like that they offer them since many places don't. Overall the 3 fries were more than the 4 of us could eat. I'd eat here again but it would not be one of my first choices."}
{"text":"This place is literally the bomb we are all the time it's always great!  I like that there's vegetarian options.  I like that they can customize everything the way you want it.  Nothing is ever greasy and my new favorite things are the tempura green beans!!"}
{"text":"I kind of stumbled across this place looking for a place to eat near me to kill some time with my boyfriend. We both really enjoyed the atmosphere and the prices were decent. When we got our food, we were very satisfied with how filling it was. The burgers were deliciously juicy.... I make it a point to recommend this place to people who haven't been."}
{"text":"The manager reached out due to my last review. Sent me a free burger. Wasn't in a hurry to use but finally craved a burger figured I'd try again. I still paid a bit to get a free meal BUT it was so much better. I'm back for second time this week. Also young girl up front both times was really nice."}
{"text":"Hamburgers were good. The French fries are great. This place is a great concept that has great potential. Ordered a \"double char\" with cheese with all the fixings. Burger is prepared one temperature (they don't ask). The concept is an obvious play on In-N-Out but the burgers are not an In-N-Out burger. Simple menu, quality food!  Spent $11.00 for lunch for double burger, fries and drink. Comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious and great service. Got a protein burger. Was a little messy but to be expected when there's no bun. Lol milkshake also delicious and recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked here from the strop and it was worth it! The burgers were good. The fries were good and the fried green beans were super good. My husband had a shake and he said it was good. He said it reminded him of the Nestle strawberry syrup that we used to put in our milk when we were kids. The hand made juices weren't that great though. I had to mix some soda in mine and I don't drink soda. Overall it was good though. Better than In and Out Burger?...I would say no. They are both good and different. Try them both"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I went to Habit Burger and I went back a few weeks ago and ordered their new \"secret\" off menu burger that they just started talking about. I was a fan in the past but I will say I wasn't a fan of this burger. I love sourdough bread but this was very dry. The whole sandwich was dry and they cut the meat then grilled it which dried it out too. I thought they had fallen from grace.
So I had to go back and give them one more try since I was such a fan in the past. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Sure enough I did. When I went back I just ordered the regular Double Char with Swiss cheese and everything on it. It was as good as I remember. Whew. I was worried there for a second. It was nice and big and juicy and also cheaper then I remembered. $5 for a double burger that is a lot bigger than other places burgers that are more then $5. What a deal.
I am a fan once again and will probably become a regular once again too. I am sorry I ever left.
Btw the fries and onion rings are awesome too."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, quick service, and clean tables. I'll definitely be coming back to this establishment :)"}
{"text":"Great burger restaurant i have ate at one of there other location which i will not say , this location on blue diamond is by far the best one ive been to  about 7 times and plan top come alot more"}
{"text":"I recently signed up to be a part of The Habit Burger Grill's mailing list to receive coupons and promotions.  My first coupon after signing up was for a Charbroiled Burger W/ Cheese.  I stopped in for lunch to redeem my coupon.  When I walked into the restaurant around 1:30ish I noticed there was a lot of little pieces of paper on the floor, crumbs, and unclean tables.  It wasn't filthy but it wasn't the cleanest for sure.  When it was my turn to order, I stepped up to the register and notice how FILTHY the kitchen/grill area was.  It was a mess!  Fries all over the floor, old napkins, I noticed the top of a hamburger bun on the floor.  A worker was sweeping up around the grill while I ordered.  I thought that was gross.  There wasn't a line or anything and only 3 other people dining inside of the restaurant.  I don't understand why they wouldn't just wait until no one's around to clean up around the grill.  It was gross. 

My burger came shortly after I ordered it.  I ordered it as is but added mustard.  I decided to eat in my car because of the obvious reasons.  When I took the burger out of the wrapping it was full of grease.  That's weird to me because I don't expect a Charbroiled burger to be full of grease. I took 3 bites and tossed the rest in the trash.  The worse thing is when I got back to my desk my fingers smelled horrible.  Like I ate or touched something bad.  They smelled like old grease and burnt plastic.  It was weird.  I won't return to this location because I'm nervous of the conditions."}
{"text":"This place has really good burgers. I'm a big fan of the teriyaki burger it comes with a slice of pineapple I like to customize mine and have it on sourdough bread. Great fries as well I think this place is better than five guys and almost as good as in and out"}
{"text":"If you're spending $150-200+ per couple at night and want to throttle back on food spending, check this lunch place out.  Wife and I were staying at the Palazzo so on a suggestion we wandered over to the Fashion Show Mall and up to the Food Court (3rd floor).  Food Court just a slight level above most but not that much to look at.  The Habit was our destination.  I wanted to try the Santa Monica burger they were known for.  It didn't disappoint.  Good sized burger (I only finished half) w/ advocado on grilled sourdough.  Wife got the salad that was a special seasonal item (edaname, added tuna, etc).  She really liked it.  All sandwiches come with fries.  Soft drinks are all you can drink.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Restaurant and seating area was very clean.  Price for lunch was under $25 for two people.  Very good by Vegas standards."}
{"text":"Great food everyone. Love the chicken sandwich, charburger and sweet potatoe fries."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. LOVE their lettuce wrapped burgers. Great flavor and definitely fresh. I always add bacon and avocado to my lettuce wrapped burger. Their sweet potato fries and green bean tempura fries are delicious. I haven't had the regular fries yet but my kids love them. I have also had the sourdough burger and it was huge and very filling. They have other healthy menu options I haven't tried yet but it's definitely a really good burger joint."}
{"text":"Ordered my burger to go online. Quoted ready time was accurate. I was impressed with the drink selection. They had 4 different teas and strawberry limeade punch. Also, they had peppercinis, jalapeños and another pickles pepper. Got the Santa Barbara style burger. Came on sourdough bread. Burger was juicy. I loved the avocados on this sandwich. Fries were good too. 
Good service. Restaurant was very clean. Would go back again. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! This might be my new fav place for burgers not only because they have juicy burgers but because i can order my burger in a lettuce wrap!!! This place is clean and staff is courteous."}
{"text":"Good price, clean store, short wait, food was excellent, service was great from Natasha, and the manager was having a pre-shift huddle.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Had a great experience today at lunchtime. We were greeted by Cheyenne with a huge smile and super friendly energy. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We were able to watch her while we ate and she was consistently this way with everyone the whole time!! She is a KEEPER!!!

The food was also great!

Thank you for a great lunch break!"}
{"text":"Did not live up to what others have said about the place. 5 guys across the street is much better, smashbuger continues to the best burger in town!"}
{"text":"Good food. I love the fried green beans and fries. The burgers are seasoned well and the portion is what you'd customer expect. Service could be better. Maybe a little more friendly and polite. The person taking our order seemed to be rushing us when we were the only ones in line and seemed annoyed when we asked for ketchup and ranch. Hopefully, our next visit will be better."}
{"text":"Upside is location. I like that the Habit opened so close to me and the price is reasonable. Food is always good, but burger was dry last time. The lady at the front register was nice but the other lady manager behind her was rude and seemed like she didn't want to help the lady at the register having trouble with the register. I don't know what was wrong but after 5 mins of trying to order another manager guy finally came out laughing saying sorry there was no money in the register. I didn't get really what was going on but it was super unprofessional and unpleasant."}
{"text":"Been a fan since I got introduced to it in Valencia, CA. I just wish there were more on the west side of Phoenix. Everything on the menu it great. Vegetarian or not, you got to try the veggie burger. Amazing taste. My favorite is the bbq chicken salad."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru around 130pm and there only 2 cars in line, took about 10 minutes in total to get my order. Based on the other reviews i expected a crazy line and for the wait to be a half hour or longer. 

As for the food, the onion rings are the best ive ever had! Make sure to get a side of ranch with them, soo good. They have a peach ginger nectar drink sometimes that really yummy too. The burger was okay, just tasted like a whopper, nothing special. But the price is decent for the amount of food you get! And the customer service, even just in the drive thru was great!"}
{"text":"A tad more expensive than In-n-Out but a price I'll gladly pay. The burgers here are out of this world. PLEASE open a store in the west valley. I hate having to drive 45 minutes for a burger... but I do. That is how good this place is."}
{"text":"So fresh and yummy! A twist on the usual burger places and we love it. We have yet to find a thing on the menu that we don't love"}
{"text":"My first attempt at habit.

I entered the establishment and was greeted happily. I had never been here before so I asked for her suggestion.

She didn't suggest the standard charge burger what she did say was try the Santa Barbara. It is two small patties with all of the fixings on sour dough, plus avocado. The bite has everything you could ask for salty sweet in the meet. As they say the patties do not appear to be that large for the price but the flavor is there.   I asked for extra pickles and retrieve the peppers on the side myself for a little kick.

I also got a side of onion rings which were crunchy sweet and come with a side of ranch.

I do not know if it could replace an in and out burger animal style but I would return."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and that delicious charbroiled taste! The green beans and sweet potato fries were really good too. Clean facilities, helpful staff and good music."}
{"text":"I just don't know if there is a 5 star burger joint anywhere in the valley. If so, please hit me up! 

The atmosphere is industrial/beach style, very clean as other reviewers stated, and the burgers are a good value. The ingredients are fresh and tasty. I am not sure what they are trying to do with the salsa bar? It really does not fit a burger joint. Looks more like it should be in a Rubio's. Marketing folks at the habit, take notice. What were you thinking here?

It would be nice if there was a location further up north. I would not go out of my way to come her, but if in the area would definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"This place was great all the way around.  Not only was to food really good but the service was equally as good.  I will definitely eat there again as it is my new favorite burger place to eat."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burgers and good pricing for kids meals. The BBQ Bacon Charburger is delicious and goes really well with a side of their onion rings. Portion size is easily big enough to split with another. Even for those with bigger appetites. Great location in arrowhead now makes it convenient for us west-siders."}
{"text":"First time at The Habit and for fast food, was impressed. Pricing was great. $3.25 for a charburger and only $.60 more to put cheese on it. The kids meals were only $3.99, and included fries and a drink. The kids burger looked the same size as our burgers, so quite the deal. 

As for flavor, I was amazed that something so cheap could taste as good as it did. Kudos to The Habit for making a decent burger. Tried the grilled chicken sandwich, which looked like a large sandwich, but it was on a really thick French roll that was so-so. The actual chicken on it was minimal. Very thin slices, and I don't think it even took up the length of the bread. Tasted okay. 

Shakes were good. Whipped cream was thicker and heavier than most, though. Could've filled up on just that. 

There isn't much seating inside - there's a lot outside - but in 100 degree heat with the patio on the west side, that's a fail."}
{"text":"burgers are good but the oil is obviously overused and the service was poor. the prices for the burgers is good but the rest of the prices were not worth it."}
{"text":"I have been here previously and they have always been good. Last night I ran over there after work to grab some food to bring home. I knew that they closed at ten so rushed to get there. I got there at 9:48 and they had already locked the door. I saw there was people still inside eating and there was two people at the counter chatting. I knocked to see if I was able to still order and they just looked at me and walked away! I understand they don't want last minute customers but you can't close an extra ten minutes and ignore them! Very frustrating because most places close around ten! I just ran across the street to chipotle with 3 minutes till they closed and they served me still!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers and drinks Ive had in a long time. A must try if your in the area very clean and friendly service. Next time going to try the desert."}
{"text":"This is from a vegetarian visiting so take this with a grain of salt.  I stopped by to try the veggie burger since I was craving some onion rings.  Their veggie burger comes super vegetabled-out with sprouts and cucumbers even as a vegetarian I'm not that big of a fan of cucumbers and sprouts on a burger so I got it with cheese and left off the previously mentioned.  It was pretty dry and over cooked as veggie burgers go with nothing special going on.  If restaurant  is going to have one on the menu at least try to make it better than the freezer section ones.  They must be doing well though I had to wait a really long time for my food even on off hours.  They were busy but they didn't seem slammed for the wait I had.  The onion rings were kinda greasy and the breading was falling off so the main reason I came was a bummer as well.

They might be good for the carnivores, but I would skip it if you are a vegetarian and want a burger fix."}
{"text":"I don't often leave bad reviews but I'll make an exception here. I took my kids in tonight and ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, a barbecue chicken salad and a chicken nugget kids meal. I almost walked out when I was met with the smell of sewer as we walked in, but the kids were starving so we ordered. The salad was by far the worst. The chicken was like rubber. Honestly I don't think you'd be able to tell the difference between the two. The chicken sandwich was just bad. The bread was stale, the chicken was burnt and the flavor was awful. The kids meal was ok- no better than Burger King. The worst part was there was no place to sit so we took our meal to go and couldn't even send it back by the time we got home to eat it. My daughter said that the only good thing about the whole meal was the cucumbers, so at least they have that going for them..."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Ordered online at 12:45 for a 1:00 pick up. Went in at 12:55 order was done.  Went to eat it, it was sloppily wrapped like by a 9 year old did it and was barely warm. It got 3 stars for the friendly staff and hot fries.  As for me I'll stick to In & Out and SmashBurger for a fast food burger, they give you more meat too."}
{"text":"The habit burger and grill lives up to its name! The service along gets 5 stars. The staff was friendly, they even had someone walking around checking to see if diners needed anything and even offered to get us refills. For how busy they were they cleaned tables fast for new diners and the drink and condiment area was clean which can be hard to maintain with a line out the door and the drive thru backed up. Now to the food it was so good it made me wanna slap my momma and the cooks momma too! It's hard to find a quality burger in a fast food establishment. I got the original double with cheese and my husband got the Santa Barbra style burger. It was seasoned and cook perfectly! The food is made to order so you know your food is fresh and has not set and waited on you. I will be going here often and try some other things off their menu. I am definitely a fan of this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I had a number 1 combo with avocado and it was one of the better burgers I have had, definitely a step above the standard fast food burger.  This place was extremely clean and everyone was very friendly. The condiments were a plus, I had some yellow hot chilies with my meal at no extra charge. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after passing by multiple times on my way home.  I'm glad I did!  I've been back twice and love the consistency on what they deliver.  I had the double char cheeseburger each time while my girlfriend tried the single char and the grilled chicken sandwich on our 2nd visit.  Everything tasted fresh and exactly like the first time we stopped in.  The Habit is a refreshing experience compared to the multiple In N Out and Fatburger locations scattered around town.  If you haven't yet,  try it!"}
{"text":"Great food but terrible drive thru service! I'm sorry but if you have a thirty minute wait in drive the least you could do is apologize for the wait and idk maybe to try to talk to your customers. We waited for 15 minutes at the window and only time the window opened up was for payment and the food handout. Never again!"}
{"text":"Ordered thru postmates one night and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the tri tip sandwich and the meat was absolutely delicious, but my only issue was it needed more meat! I also ordered a burger. Very tasty. Nothing amazing about it but very good. Will definitely go again when opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"Had two double char burgers with cheese and one without with raw onion (usually comes with caramelized onions), sweet potato fries and regular fries.  Both burgers were amazingly good and fresh.  The sweet potato fries are some of the best, but the regular fries were nothing to write home about.  On the fries they need to take a lesson from Smashburger--their smash fries are really, really good.  
The cooks made a mistake on one of the burgers and management more than made up for it.  Great manager!!  This is a place that I would return to over and over again.  I  suggest to the management to come up with a better substitute for the mundane french fries.  Otherwise, The Habit Burger Grill is a hit!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a grilled chicken sandwich. The onion rings and fries are very good too."}
{"text":"Yo yo yo my Favorite AZ peeps , went to Habit Burger today and had the Santa Barbara burger was very delicious , popping with flavor ... avocado, grilled caramelized onions, cheese, pickles  and ordered a double Char with cheese , French fries and Tempera beans .  The price was great 21 dollars for all of that with two drinks . They scored three stars because for me the top three burger places are ... Five Guys, In-N- Out and Freddy's .  A bit disappointed because the floor was dirty and the open tables were dirty I had to clean the table myself .  As always if you go let me know what you think. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This new place is awesome! Had a free charburger w/cheese (wrapped in lettuce of course) and got onion rings and the fresh homemade peach, ginger, nectar juice.  They offer free ranch as a dip too. The cashier was super friendly, place was clean, and customers seemed happy! :)"}
{"text":"These burgers are bomb!!!! And the best part is I don't feel guilty eating them because they are so low in calories. Their lemonades are delicious. I'm a return customer for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat, the menu is pretty good with an excellent variety, the service is always great as well, and the place is never overcrowded. I usually do not get burgers here, as I actually prefer the other items on the menu even more. The burgers here are OK,  I would say on par with BK, flame broiled, good, but not as good as smash burger or even five guys. The shakes here are also not as good as smash burgers, but again, I come here for the other items on the menu.  My nephew likes the burgers a lot; he likes them even more than smash burgers, so everyone's opinion will be different. Stop on in and see what you think.  My wife and I both had salads here recently and they were very good; she rarely eats salads but said she would have either one again as both were very tasty."}
{"text":"I went because I was watching a newscast that boasted \"the best burger in the country.\" That statment alone made me visit...It was good-don't get me wrong-I had the single cheeseburger-while it was good-I've had better-I prefer IN & OUT to The Habit-but I would visit again. Malts are tasty-onion rings are good too...Friendly service."}
{"text":"So excited that Habit has finally landed in Vegas! Took me a week to find out that this location has opened! I always make sure I visit Habit when I visit California, but I will no longer need to do that! 

I always order the mushroom char because I love anything mushroom! My bf got the double char and it was just as delicious. The meat was tender, just like the locations in Cali. In my opinion, there are no other fast food places that can compare to the quality they serve here. 

Will be coming back whenever I feel a bit naughty with my diet."}
{"text":"We moved here a few months ago after I completed a work assignment in Santa Barbara.  I was delighted to see a Habit Burger nearby!

Great food, consistent quality, and good prices."}
{"text":"ALOHA! Summerlin! 
The Habit burger joint is GREAT!
I had the veggie burger w/
String bean tempura, a drink... HEAVEN!
I was w/ my BF and 2 other friends who drove us
Around. We love Vegas, and come get to see Summerlin Trader Joes..
Eat at ur restaurant!! Love the ppl .. enjoy the
Food. 
Ppl speak ENGLISH on the job! Outstanding! 
We well be back for sure. Maybe get a rent
A car on our next vacation. 
Thank You for great burgers."}
{"text":"Confession: I love hamburgers and have yet to eat one I don't like. 

Here's the deal, I've been here a couple times because it's right by my office. Today I went and got the Santa Barbara with cheese and mushrooms in a lettuce wrap (lettuce wrap bc I wanted fries and I feel better about myself if I do it this way OKAY?!?! Stop judging me). Well, it wasn't the same without the bun but it was stilllll sooooooo delicious. But again, me love hamburgers. *pounds chest* 

The fries were a little soggy today, but that's okay Habit, you are forgiven. I'll just have to order them crispy next time. 

I also have been wanting to try the chicken and tuna stuff but can't seem to deviate away from beef. Maybe one day I'll be brave and order a chicken burger and a side order of Charburger to go with it!"}
{"text":"My custom built is the albacore on sourdough, no mayo, extra pickles.  

But better than the custom built sandwich is how customer service is handled at this location.  When the sandwich wasn't what I had ordered, management whipped up another and comped a malt.  

Smart marketing/ customer satisfaction move as I would not have tried one otherwise.  But did that they already know that?"}
{"text":"Ordered the bacon bbq cheese burger and the teriyaki burger. Both were perfect and scrumptious. This is now my go-to burger place. We added the French fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings to share. All three were tasty too. Three kinds of fresh brewed iced teas to chose from. There is also a side bar that had lemon and lime wedges and various peppers. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Will be definitely back again and again to try it all!!"}
{"text":"Love the Habit!! The freshness, the options and most of all overall taste!! They have amazing onion rings, French fries, burgers and salads!! The ranch is amazing with both the fries and onion rings!! Yum!! Whenever I am feeling a burger, I think about this place now!! You also have to try their fried green beans, amazingly good!! I have yet to try their shakes. There is also a peppers bar, where you can find jalapeños and banana peppers!
   Service here is always so great!! The employees here are always super friendly and enthusiastic!! Every time!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"It's OK. There are far better burgers in the area for the same price or less. This is just another overpriced, overhyped trendy chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good.

I don't give it a higher rating because I do not appreciate the up-selling.  When you order an item they ask if you want cheese and they don't tell you it's an up-sale.  They don't say, \"Do you want cheese for $1 more.\"  They ask if you want cheese on it as though the cheese were included already and they want to ensure you want it.  It is sneaky and I don't like it.  They get a lot of people on these gimmicks and it hurts their brand."}
{"text":"Great customer service! I felt like I was at a 5 star restaurant. Foods not bad, typical burger and fries.

\"Stay thirsty my friends\""}
{"text":"So here it goes..... I got the double with everything on it fries and a drink. The food came out really fast and it was cooked well. As for the burger I have to say it's just ok. The bread was just regular bread nothing fancy here. The meat wasn't as juicy as say shake shake or five guys! The toppings are great and the burger is filling but just was missing that overall wow factor. It is a good burger but it's far from great.    

 That may be harsh but I love my burgers and expected more. I'm not saying don't give this place a try but according to others reviews I was expecting better. Others compared it to five guys and it's not even close.....

 So why the four stars? Because It is a good burger and the service is awesome the staff is super friendly. I have eaten at all kinds of burger joints all over the place and each of them have unique factors good and bad, including the price which may be a deciding factor for some other is taste and location. Give this place a try and see for yourself....... Happy eating!"}
{"text":"It's a chain, so if you've been to one this is a good one. Actually received the best service here and food just as good as any other, and fast wait times, that's all you need to know if you've already had one. If you are new to the habit please read on. Better yet just go, unless you cannot make it there this instant in which case read on to see what you're missing out on.

Best \"fast food\" burger I've had. In-n-out, you tried. Five Guys, you did your best, but once you've been here any other chain will become nothing more than a good, but not great memory. It's the perfect combination of a satisfying meal without the subsequent food coma. I don't know how they do the double char so well that it does not feel greasy at all, but still doesn't skimp on the portion or taste."}
{"text":"Good burgers, made to order no sandbagging here.  Still prefer Five Guy's and InnOut.  Although the menu here is a lot more expansive, I'd like to try some of the other menu items.  The Golden chicken was well seasoned and had the perfect amount of spice.  My wife got the Super food Salad which was very tasty.  Just a bit pricey, but for the quality of the food it was on point."}
{"text":"Burger was good, great char smell but it didn't carry over into the flavor much. Tuna burger was okay, I appreciated that I didn't get buried in mayonnaise with it.

Fries were the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"This place is great! I always get the char burger with fries and a chocolate shake. It's great every time. The place is clean, and I don't wait long for my order."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Habit Burgers a year or so back when I visited the Bay area- loved their char burgers then, glad to have them in easy reach now. They may have salads on the menu, but do yourself a favor and just get the burger. The salads aren't bad but they're really average- I stole the first and last bites of my guy's burger to console myself.

The sides deserve a mention, too- in addition to some standard but well-executed fries, they also offer tempura green beans, which are a fun little switch to make to your standard burger meal. Don't think they're actually \"healthy\" though, I mean they're still fried.

Service is great. Even coming at the end of the dinner rush, counters were clean and staff were courteous. My takeout order was packed up nicely and I was offered additional ketchup and ranch (gratis!) before I headed out. Don't forget to check out the \"chili bar\"-- chili peppers, pepperoncinis, and jalapenos galore."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers ever! This place is delicious and inexpensive. The staff is very friendly and always walking taking trays,  cleaning tables,  and walking around making sure everyone is great. This location was very clean as well."}
{"text":"I know, people say it's just a burger place but they are really tasty burgers! They grill and then flame broil which somehow tastes great, especially for the price. Their sweet potato fries are also delicious."}
{"text":"First trip to the habit.  Got the Portabella char.  There were significant amounts of mushroom Excellent flavor and a decent size sandwich.  Garlic aioli was good.  They have sweet potato fries as an option.  Ate here at 6 o'clock on a Friday and it wasn't too packed.  Service was fast.  Workers are very friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting. I worked late and stopped to bring dinner home.  I ordered two meals and when I got home, was short a sandwhich. I tried to call and was not able to talk to anyone. Message said go to the website and hung up.  The burger I did get was dry/overdone and the fries were extremely salty. Only plus was they had good ranch! Not a good first experience. Will not be back. Let's hope I get some resolution."}
{"text":"It was my first time here with my best friend and we decided to share the #1 (char cheese burger), which comes with fries and a regular drink! We also added avocado in it and ordered a side of onion rings.

When we finally got our order, I was confused why the cashier didn't include the fries on the tray. I guess she thought we wanted to substitute the fries with the onion rings? But really, we wanted both.

Nevertheless, one of the managers (I didn't get to ask for his name) approached us and asked how everything was after overhearing me talking to the cashier about the confusion with my order. I told him what happened and he told us not to worry about it and brought the basket of fries right to us!

Overall, the food was awesome, service was great, and the staff was super friendly! Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"This place tastes amazing!! I ordered the #1 - The burger was flavorful and was topped with fresh veggies and nicely grilled onions caramelized to perfection. I normally don't eat a whole burger anywhere I go but devoured the entire thing.  The French fries tasted great as well. Nice and crisp and not overly oily like some places. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the habit. Food is excellent.  I was happy to see one open up in North Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"This place Rocks!!! The food is amazing if you are a fan of In-N-Out you will really like this place it is so much better . The food is fresh and amazing . Service is so fast place your order at the counter and sit down they give you a little buzzer to let you know your food is ready . They make there Ranch here fresh and have a lot of fresh teas and drinks to choose from . 

Service is so friendly here . This place is a gem believe me you will not be disappointed ."}
{"text":"This place is really excellent. The prices are reasonable and the food is very good. They don't have a giant selection, but they seem to have enough variations to make everyone happy. The salads are excellent as are the burgers. The only negative, the place isn't large and it can be tough to find a seat near noon. Oh, and maybe they could clean their tables a bit more often."}
{"text":"burgaaaaaaaaaars!!!!! DEEEELICIOUS burgars! yes burgars with an A, the letters dont run me! The Habit Burgars are something out of this world. A completely different beast than that of the In N Out variety. Less greasy than In N Out, I would say slightly tastier than In N Out, but as claimed a completely different beast. Habit has a way of pairing up their burgars with their interestingly yummy fries, sweet potato fries, & motherfuckin' onion rings! 
Onion Rings!!!!! Holy mother of all that is sweet, crispy, & tasty. This is what you do, if you're a fat as fatass like me, order a Double CharCheez & a side of onion rings, open your burgar, stuff desired amount of onion rings (all of them if you're fat as fatass like me), & reassemble to your liking, add sauces if you wish (I care not much for sauces but sometimes it does not hurt), and then take a bite of your Double CharOnionRingCheez burgar! Heaven.
Not so sure about their shakes but one of these days i'm going to have to try one.

I know this is the one for AZ but this is the place where i first tried The Habit, so dont knock me chumps!"}
{"text":"It was really good, simple selections etc. A bit on the pricey side.  The fries where pretty average, good,  but average.  Could have gotten fries like that anywhere. My boyfriend and I prefer in-n-out,  and smash burger,  but this was good too"}
{"text":"I tried Habit Burger a few weeks ago and was surprised at how fresh and delicious it was.  All the ingredients were crisp and the burger actually looked like it did in the pictures,  unlike some places where they just throw it together. The fries are my favorite of anywhere I've had so far!"}
{"text":"This has to be hands down one of my favorite burgers I've ever had. I have never written a review on here before but this place MADE ME NEED TO TELL EVERYONE HOW GOOD IT IS. The customer service was great and the environment was clean and nicely decorated.
I got the Double Charburger with cheese, fries, and a drink.
I was completely blown away by how well the patties were seasoned, it wasn't bland at all.
The buns are toasted and all the veggies are super crunchy and fresh. As a big fan of pickles, these pickles were above average, crunchy and not too sour. The onions are caramelized and the sweetness brings all the flavors together. Fries were amazing! Crunchy and really well salted! Not that greasy either. They have two drinks made in house Strawberry Limeade - a little sweet in my opinion but really nice, not too tarte 
Peach and Ginger Nectar with Basil - AMAZING!! really refreshing and a unique flavor I enjoyed very much.
Overall, this has been one of the best burger places I've ever been to. I would highly recommend that everyone come and try this at least once. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers! I like the single char no cheese, no bun wrapped in lettuce with grilled onions. Really good juicy burger. Fries are really good as well, I recommend them with ranch for dipping but that's just me. Nice friendly staff. Have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Love there chicken and milkshakes and the fries were just awesome! The mini gummy hamburger in the kids meal was just adorable and just makes this place even better. Workers are very kind and food is made extremely quick"}
{"text":"I'm not a hamburger person, but this place is not your ordinary hamburger place.  They are even better than In-N-Out and lower calories.  They have a selection on the bun and the meat.  The stake sandwich is fabulous."}
{"text":"Had chicken ceaser salad. Paid $7.05 and salad seem small. Will not get a salad next time. But I do recommend the burgers especially the terayaki burger!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best hamburger joint around! They put just the right amount of toppings so it's not like you're biting into a lettuce sandwich. There is usually a little bit of a wait but I guess that's to be expected when the food is good. Prices are fair and the environment is clean. If you're looking for a great burger, look no more...this is the place!"}
{"text":"I am definitely not a local, but we chose to come here because I wanted a burger. I can see why the locals come here rather than Five Guys across the street. The burgers are absolutely delicious (I couldn't scarf mine down fast enough!) and the fries were fresh and crisp. It was reasonably priced and the food was delivered in a very timely manner. There were even managers checking to see how the food was. I can tell you, this is not a normal thing in the north east! I'm not sure if this is a chain or not, but if I ever see this place again (or if I'm in Phoenix again), my family and I are stopping here!"}
{"text":"Just had our first Habit burgers and we understand how they got their name! Heard they were good from friends who had them out of state so we were game. Hubs got the double char and I had the teriyaki burger combos. The food was ready in 5-10 minutes and came up piping hot, exactly how I like it! I want to nearly burn my mouth on my food after eating many a lukewarm meal while raising children! The Habit did not disappoint! The staff was very friendly. We were approached by several helpful employees, offering their services. The only negative thing to say is actually not their fault. The address is Hughes Center Drive, but they are actually on the NW corner of Flamingo and Paradise, facing Flamingo. Google maps had us on a bit of a goose chase. Now that we have found them it will be easy to make our way back, even from across town. We will gladly make the trek! FIVE STARS!"}
{"text":"Another great burger chain! I love seeing quality fast food burger joints pop up all around the city and the country. These establishments have a cornered out a great segment in the market and have tons of potential for growth in the coming years. 

I tried The Habit after reading an article online that surveyed costumers from all around the country as to which high-end burger joints would they most want to move into a city near them. To my surprise is was not In-N-Out or Five Guys at the top of the list - it was The Habit. Having never heard of them before I was delighted to find that we here in Phoenix are lucky enough to have one in out downtown area. As soon as I got my food I could clearly see what all the fuss online was about. This burger rocks! Most notably The Habit uses really fresh ingredients, the cheese is perfect and tasty, and the onions are grilled to perfection and plentiful. I order a side of fries and a chocolate malt to accompany my burger. The fries were nothing special. I was really expecting a whole lot more and was disappointed to find how basic they were. However, the chocolate malt was the best I have had all summer! I would highly recommend giving The Habit a try the next time you are downtown."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! Customer service was great! I could go everyday.. Food was fresh and facility was clean! Yummyyyy"}
{"text":"The people that work there are absolutely the most disrespectful and unreasonable people I have ever come across. We ordered a simple kids burger, and asked for them to substitute the regular patty with a veggie patty. Instead of being nice and doing so, they decided to argue with us for twenty minutes about how the restaurant policy does not allow this. When I say argue, I mean a full on yelling and screaming argument. With us. We eventually left, however before we left the lady proceeded to start up another argument by saying \"check the menu before you fight with us.\" Talk about horrible costumer service. This is not an exaggeration."}
{"text":"The Habit had friendly service and was decently fast (I did come at 11 am before the rush), but I just don't see what all the raving reviews are for.

It's basically a more expensive In and Out Burger with worse fries. The burger was better I think because they have avocado as a topping. Their fries were like Burger King's, which I hate. If you like them, maybe you'll like the Habit more than me. 

Pricing was I think $5.95 for a burger meal, but it didn't include cheese or bacon so you have to pay for each topping you want. I want to try their chicken club melt but I saw a $6.75 price tag (no fries or drink). For those prices I'd rather go to a sit down grill like Mac's.

Overall I'll go there if someone else wants to, but not a on consistent basis or anything."}
{"text":"Food was good but the tables were disgusting.  They definitely need to send someone round to clean more often."}
{"text":"I don't see what all of the fuss is about. Just a typical burger chain. The food is typical, service is exactly as you'd expect from a chain. Will I return? Probably if I'm in the area. But I definitely wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"WORST drive thru ever. I've been in line for 30 minutes and there are still people ahead of me. Thanks for giving me the time to write this review while I was in line, habit. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here several times; Excellent Service, Burgers, consistency,  fries cooked to golden perfection every time. No extra fee  foo charges, free ranch for the asking (awesome to dip fries in)
Where Burger Kings & Queens Reign. .
I observed an employee going from table to table asking everyone?
 How was their meal? Is there anything I can bring you?
THE HABiT, aptly named."}
{"text":"The food would receive a 4 from me. It's not your BEST burger but it is better in terms of the other burger chains. 
The service is what gets a 5! It was our first time there and one of the workers went above and beyond for us. She was very nice and helped us in our selections. The food was cheap and my boyfriend really enjoyed the turkey burger. They're really nice to kids and even gave them extra candy along with free drinks. Service as prompt and the place was clean. They should expand their place though."}
{"text":"Wow!  I mean, I was hungry after a long flight from the east coast, but the food at this burger bar was outstanding. Among our group, we had almost everything on the menu except the veggie burger. My SB Char was really tasty, and the tempura green beans were perfectly done.  All the other burgers were great (portabella char was my next favorite) and the sweet potato fries should not be missed! Great drinks and shakes finish off the meal."}
{"text":"I would like to thank the crew at Habit Burger for giving away free burger, fries and drinks on their opening day. The burger tasted good but had a very small patty. I hope when they are selling burgers the actual patty is bigger. The fries were ok, possibly frozen fries. The staff was friendly and food was pretty good. They have a few different types of burgers to chose from, I will have to give some of them a try. Tough competition in that area for burgers with Islands, In-N-Out and Wendy's all right there."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get quick delicious food. I had never been to a habit before and now I will definitely be back. Everything is cooked to order. The fries were hot and delicious. The meat they use in the burgers is a superior quality to most fast food places. I love that they caramelize the onions for their burgers. The service was fast and accurate. They have a great menu selection including salads, malts, chicken sandwiches as well as really good burgers. The prices were surprisingly good for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Great burger joint in the Southwest part of town!

Everything we had was tasty and very reasonably priced.

We ordered the Charburger w/ cheese & fries and Albacore tuna filet sandwich on sourdough & sweet potato fries. Both orders were great! No complaints. 

Service was friendly and food came out relatively quick. They have a self serve area for condiments with different sauces and peppers. 

I definitely recommend this place and will be making repeat visits especially it's practically right across the street from my house! (:"}
{"text":"I had the Santa Barbara style with onion rings, it was phenomenal! My wife had a double char and fries and she said that was phenomenal! The service was great and there small chili bar was just the thing that made this a 5 star review for me."}
{"text":"Last nights To-Go order: 
Char Burger w/avocado. Burger was delicious ~ Yum! 
Extra crispy french fries were perfect!
Price was reasonable for a burger of this caliber. 
No drive-thru
No waiters
Staff very friendly

I WILL BE GOING BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"I saw 4 stars and figured why not try it. I ordered from the wrong location, not knowing the rating was lower at different locations. I ordered online, choosing done asap option. The ordered said will be done at 530, which was about 20 minutes, drove 12 minutes to get it arriving at 530 and waited til 538 to receive my order. The fries are ok, the burgers are ok, the onion rings were good. Kind of over priced food really, IN&OUT is about half the price and better!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the Habit was great! Very clean restaurant with friendly service. I ordered the #2 Double Char Cheeseburger. I think this might be better than the Double-Double from In-N-Out. The pepper bar is a nice touch with a choice of 3 different peppers to add to your burger."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only has 3 1/2 stars! 

The food is delicious. The burgers are juicy but not greasy or messy by any means. The toasted bun adds a wonderful touch to the overall taste of the burger. All of the condiments and sides are fresh, crisp, and tasty! I myself had a #1, it was great!

The service was helpful, polite and quick. The restaurant itself was clean and open. I have already returned once with a newcomer in tow and will definitely be returning again!"}
{"text":"Come on with burgers as good as the ones here.  Who would go anywhere else. The onion rings and the fried green beans are reason enough to keep this place on the radar.   I hate to say it but I think I've found a better burger than in and out."}
{"text":"We really like eating here. Have never had a seating problem. Food is really good and the place is really clean. I recommend the chicken caesar salad and the tuna sandwich. This is our new go to burger place. Kids love it too."}
{"text":"Charbroiled burgers seemed unique but nothing special. Fries are good but both times Ive ordered sweet potato fries and they are always cold. It's good but not great like Five Guys or Farmer Bros. I liked the extras bar with peppers & stuff."}
{"text":"If your in a rush this isn't the place for you. They make all the food fresh and the presentation is decent. I ordered a burger and fries  they in separate bags. If you one of those picky people about food touching, I highly recommend the habit."}
{"text":"First time at The Habit. GOOD burgers (had the double char/double cheese with bacon),  decent fries, stellar onion rings. Restaurant was clean, good service. A new Habit fan!"}
{"text":"Am I at a fast food place or a sit down restaurant? With the great service it was hard to tell.   The staff at Habit came over to check on us more than some fine dining places.  They really made us feel like a valued customer.   

I realize it's crazy ordering a chicken club on sourdough at a place that specializes in burgers.  This sandwich was flavorful with the marinated chicken breast, bacon and fixings.  I was certainly happy with this decision.  Not to mention the fabulous sweet potato fries.  Light and crispy made them the perfect compliment to the sandwich.  

I am certainly impressed especially with their hospitality.  I hope this excellence never fades.  I'll be back to try more of their delicious menu!"}
{"text":"I have so many classifications for hamburger places I can not even explain it in a few sentences.  I compare this place to other sit down places since there is not a drive through.  We stopped by here after long day of doing stuff around the house.  I got the double char with sweet potato fries and small ranch.  I love their lemonade they serve here.  I have to limit my self because there is a fair amount of sweetness too it.  My burger had good flavour and the fries were good too.  This place is great to eat at.  The problem is that it can get packed and parking can be a pain because there is a starbucks too.  I tend to go during a off time because that is when the parking spots seem to be available.  The starbucks people will park and sit there for hours in starbucks."}
{"text":"YUM!!  I hate trying new places for fear of the unknown but we decided to give it a whirl since it is only 5 minutes from home. We have ordered take-out twice now from The Habit and both times it has been awesome!  The food is great, service was great, glad we found a new burger joint in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Getting Your Food- You walk in and up to the counter to order. Be prepared to yell because the music seems to be at it's loudest in this spot. Feel free to tip using the convenient tip jar; however, be aware that you will be getting your own beverage and condiments, then taking your buzzer to a table and waiting until you go back to pick your food up. But, tip if you want.

The Food- Charburger (with processed cheese)- didn't have that charcoal flavor, or much flavor at all, except for the pickles. Disappointment. The fries- hot and crisp. Onion rings- whole onions (not minced) with a panko-type breading- really good, with a unique taste that made them stand out.

The Amazingly Rude- I saw an employee make a boy get up out of his table and stand to the side so she could sweep. She did let him sit back down after she was finished.

The Verdict- Everything was just \"okay\", with the exception of onion rings. I don't see myself going back unless someone else really wants to eat here."}
{"text":"First time in this new spot. All in all was very good, however the patties were woefully under-seasoned. Some salt and pepper would make the burger a standout. Onion rings were very crispy and tasty. Strawberry shake top notch. Will return."}
{"text":"WOW!  My wife and I are now BIG fans of The Habit.  

I saw a couple reviewers compare it to In-N-Out, Five Guys, and Smashburger.  I would say this place seems fresher and better than all of those places.

First of all, great, fast service.  
Second, delicious food, and a big variety of it.  My wife got the Santa Barbara Burger, I got the Steak Sandwich, and we tried the Onion Rings, French Fries, and Tempura Green Beans.  All was excellent, and all cost less than $20 total.  Great value.

If you're in the area, you'd be making a mistake not stopping in to give The Habit a try.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"BOMB :)

Eat here. Good food. Great quality. Fast service. Dont compare this to some fast food joint. Its much much nicer. Sit down restaurant quality, but you walk up an order QSR style. :-)"}
{"text":"I guess they train their counter staff to not listen to the customer's order.  This has happened to me in the past, as you can see by my previous reviews of this location.

You try and put in your order, and the cashier is rude and interrupts.  Constantly.  The resulted in an incorrect order on three points, of which I only knew to correct two.  My wife had ordered her sandwich without onions, and the cashier screwed it up.  

I would be one thing if they just got the order wrong, but the cashier actively interrupting the customer causes errors and confusion and I didn't appreciate the attitude of the cashier when I had to correct our order.  There are many good burger options around this store, and we will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is straight fire. Growing up in Southern California I was concerned moving to Phoenix. In-n-Out gets all the hype but the Habit is the real deal. Been eating the Habit over a decade and can't go wrong with a Charburger and Fries. Plus the girl who worked there always hooked it up with the $2 feed the children, get a free burger coupons. Feeding children and free burgers? This is the American Dream."}
{"text":"First time, last time. The burger and fries were good but mostly because they were salty, nothing special about the taste. I ordered a double burger and found the portions for both the burger and especially fries (which were also very salty) to be small for the price. I rarely eat fast food but like a good burger spot and was willing to pay a premium for a different experience. No different than smash burger or in n out but with smash I get more and with in n out I pay a little less."}
{"text":"I was debating between a 3 and a 4, and I'm really rounding up my 3.6 :)  We'll definitely be going back.  It's a bit like In 'n Out Burger in price, with a char grilled flavour rather than the standard flat-top taste.  

Cons:
The prices are really good, but for an additional $1 for mushrooms I expected more than one sliced mushroom.  The burger patty was a little over salted.  
Pros:
Again--the prices.  Also, the fact that they have onion rings AND that they came out well done--nom nom.  The food may be slower than fast food, but it came up quite a bit more quickly than a standard sit-down restaurant.  The restaurant was fairly clean, and the staff were friendly and efficient.  Best of all--they have a lettuce-wrapped option.

We'll be going back in the weeks to come, and bringing the kids."}
{"text":"My last visit to this little eatery was a real let down. Now the young gal that runs the front end is a trooper and her service was excellent but the kitchen staff has some real need for improvement. This kitchen, on both occasions seems to lack the professionalism of a quality restaurant.

I first tried this place with a friend and I was not eating. We waited for several minutes for her burger order and I had decided to try their albacore sandwich to take home. At the time I found it interesting that the gal behind the counter had to step out of her role to ask the rest of the staff to get anything done.  I took the sandwich home and found the sandwich on sour dough to be a good healthy alternative to the typical fast food fare.

Today I rode up and had a hankerin for one of those tasty albacore sandwiches and decided to get one but try the seeded bun because it is a burger shop for crying out loud so it must be good. The bun tasted as if it had been left out for hours and was stale, tasteless and dry. (Seems to be a running theme in these reviews.) 

My fish was cold and had a slight stinky odor and though they say that they fly it in 3 times a week from Fiji I was quite surprised about the difference in quality.  I may give them one more try and taste the burgers but no mas pescado por favor."}
{"text":"I recently learned of this place in the last month or so and I must go twice a week now with my Wife. The customer service in this place is fantastic. From the moment you start having your order taken you are asked if you have been before or not and walked through if not and warmly welcomed if you have. I have had Jhoi and the Manager Edith wait on me many times and each time they nail everything from the warm greeting to making sure your order is perfect. Unlike most places they also offer ranch for free and are never stingy with it. The food is actually really good and they offer the ability to add patties, cheese, mushroom, and get extra grilled onions, which we often do, to build your own or make a larger burger and it's not very much to add the stuff at all. This has become by go to for great burgers and fries, quick and easy. The drive thru can be a little tricky. Head into the bank parking lot next to it and drive around the back left to the drive thru. If Edith or Jhoi are reading this thanks for the great service, delicious food, and great experience and I will see you in a few days I am sure."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Sun Noon. The place looked bright and clean. Big, simple menu signs. Cheerful staff took our order right away. Chicken sandwich, fries, and a chocolate malt. SJ had Santa Barbara burger w/ bacon combo. We both loved our food. Chicken was moist, tender, and yummy! We've both felt comfortably full for hours. The full-flavored malt reminded me of the passion expressed in Robert Johnson's Malted Milk song. $25 for two is a tad pricy for a lunch rotation place for me, hence the four stars. When price is no object, I don't think a place in the valley does better than the Habit."}
{"text":"I did a lot of searching all over Vegas before I picked this place. I am happy to say that there prices and burgers are delicious.  We had the Santa Barbara and the Teriyaki burger,  kids meal and the tempura gree beans. 
The Santa Barbara burger was so delicious.  I am an avacado lover and it had tons. 
Kids meal was so much for my 8 year old to eat but he gulped it up and said \"I wish McDonald's tasted like this\". Thats saying something. 
The teriyaki burger had a nice size slice of pineapple and there sauce was good. 
All around great place, fast even though they were busy and great burgers and great prices."}
{"text":"Yum! This is one of my favorite spots to grab a quick burger. I have had the tuna on a french roll, tuna lettuce wrapped, cheeseburger,and  veggie burger with avocado. The veggie burger is served with sprouts, cucumbers, and tomatoes. The fried green beans are delicious and so are the onion rings, fries, and sweet potato fries. I have not tried the salads yet, but a friend did and she loved it. Prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"The burgers are char grilled, the mushrooms are sauteed, the onions are grilled and the burger buns are toasted! That's plus stars already! Lovin this new burger joint.

Who?  
The Habit Burger Grill

Where? 
Stephanie Powers Center in the place that used to be occupied by Ulta.
Cross streets Stephanie/Warm Springs

Why?
In addition to what I previously mentioned above, there are salads and tempura green beans that are flash fried...so I dont feel too guility having that juicy burger with that melty white American cheese on it.

Lettuce wrap your burgers if you want to save on carbs...no extra charge...and they wont look at you funny either. They wrap it in plenty of lettuce too!

They have shakes and malts too!! #cheatdayeats

What Else?
Prices are super reasonable. Although I haven't step foot in MickeyD's for awhile, I'm sure you spend the same amount of $. The ground beef patties are fresh here, not frozen like other places. So no brainer, I'd opt for this place,

Dining area is bright, natural light. They did a good job utilizing the space that was a retail store just a couple months ago.  I like that they have plenty of booth seating. There's a table for large groups also. Place was busy during peak dinner hours but easily accommodated the crowd.  

Fast/Casual style, so order, pay at the counter. There's a large menu board, or grab a take-out menu to read. The staff will bring your orders out to you. 

Final Thoughts..
Three visits in since they opened in less than two weeks. Im happy with what what I ordered! (Double Char Burger Mushroom combo)  The staff here are pretty confident, and eager to please! So check The Habit Grill out already!!"}
{"text":"They have the best burgers and onion rings around hands down you have to add the grilled onion and avacado it's Delish."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. This was our first visit to a Habit and we were pleasantly surprised. We had the Tri-tip sourdough sandwich with grilled onions and teriyaki sauce. The onion rings were fresh and very crisp.
Recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Not the best veggie burger I've ever had, but not the worst either. The chipotle mayo and cucumber were a nice touch. $1.30 to add avocado and they forgot it, but luckily I got a generous sized side of it at the counter. Love the pepper bar they have there!"}
{"text":"The intersection of 7th Street and Glendale has gathered quite a few decent places to eat over the last five years or so. Pei Wei, Sauce and Qdoba on the North side of the street have now been joined by The Habit on the South side at a site that once held a sub sandwich shop and later, a local coffee house.

I ordered the double char burger and while it was not up the quality of burger found at Delux or RnR, it was better than most chains and just as good as anything found at Five Guys or Fuddruckers. 

So, if you're looking for a quick place to get a burger and you want something better than McDonalds or Burger King, you could certainly do worse than taking up this Habit!"}
{"text":"When going trough the drive thru, they never listen correctly. We ordered an item and when repeated the order back to us she said a different name. We get to the window and we told her we order this and she said it's the same thing. I think she didn't want have to make the order again the correct way"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times due to my family always going on about how much they love the food and how nice the workers are! I couldn't agree more! The chicken club is addicting!"}
{"text":"Delicious charburgers, made perfect topped with carmelized onions (plus pickle, lettuce, tomato, and mayo, which everyone knows are the classic burger toppings). Fries aren't so great: would probably opt for the  tempura green beans as a side next time."}
{"text":"Just came in with some clients & I can definitely say I am a fan! I do not know which was better the teriyaki burger or the fries! Both were amazing, will be back soon."}
{"text":"No matter which location you go to it's bomb! Decatur location is faster and nicer but the food is amazing at craig and Decatur. Yummy onion rings :)"}
{"text":"FIrst must say that the double char burger with fries combo tasted really. good.  My order was made wrong and gladly replaced so no points off.  Employees seemed very friendly.  Also liked the selection of teas but the strawberry tea made with puree was very sugary so I wished I hadn't tried it.   Nice pleasant environment"}
{"text":"I just ate at the Habit.  Not impressed at all.  I went there because I heard they have sweet potato fries, my favorite.  Since my wife and I don't eat red meat my review is limited.  I do understand they are known for their burgers.  We both ordered the grilled chicken salad with a side of sweet potato fries.  The salads were mediocre, the tomatoes were anemic and the grilled chicken was low quality, anorexic thin and tough.   At least the lettuce was not wilted.  The sweet potato fries were disappointing, Carl's Jrs. has better.  Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome experience using the drive thru. The girl taking my order was very friendly, and patient when taking my order. My veggie burger was amazing and fresh, I can't wait to my my second stop sometime soon."}
{"text":"Solid food, a bit on the pricey side.  But overall you get sit-down quality for less money and best of all NO TIP.

Had the Sourdough Double Burger with Cheese and Avocado and a side of onion rings...    AMAZINGLY TASTY...  Very good food..    Had to be one of the best burgers I have ever ate my entire life...."}
{"text":"Great place to get a bite to eat. Service has always been nice and friendly. Food taste good and fresh and a pleasant place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"I've had everything on the menu except the veggie
burgers. The chicken club is my absolute fave.
This place has got it down - simple menu - burgers,
sandwiches, and salads. Do a few things really well
rather than a lot of things just so-so. I can dig
it. You can also get a salad instead of fries so 
that's a big plus when you want to eat a bit healthier
than you can at a typical burger joint. Seating is 
both inside and outside but be warned that sometimes
you may encounter panhandlers if you sit outside. 
Also, parking can suck since this location gets rather
crowded during lunchtime and right next door is a
Starbucks that can also get crowded. I usually park a
bit east of the area so I can get out quicker. Beats
your average fast food burger joint with a baseball
bat out of the ballpark."}
{"text":"Damn you, California!  While it's no Chuckbox, I'm already going to rank The Habit as one of the great burger joints in the valley.  They had to put it right across the street from the Changing Hands Bookstore, Hoodlums Records, and Trader Joe's didn't they?  Bastards.  I see many Habit visits in my future . . . now if they only served beer . . .

At only $3.25, their Teriyaki Charburger is awesome.  Toasted bun, grilled fresh beef, grilled pineapple, grilled onions, teriyaki sauce, mayo, lettuce, nice big pickle slices, and 86 the tomato.  Grab a little cup of jalapenos, pepperoncini, and banana peppers at their peppers and sauce bar to go with it

The place was packed.  Literally a line nearly out the door, but this was at about 1pm on a Friday.  As I sat outside, I saw a bunch of people park, start walking up, then get back in their cars.  They should have stayed.  The line moved quick, and the wait for food wasn't that bad.  They give you a beeper thingy, so you know right away this isn't \"fast food\", but I love the idea of it.  Find a table and chillax.  No standing around waiting for your food, no mystery about when it's ready

I really like the side patio.  Fully covered, with ceiling fans and misters.  Will be a nice place to chill with a book you just got at the Changing Hands across the street"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here on our way to the DBG.  I'm glad we stopped in.  The burgers are awesome.  I tried their cheeseburger and my friend had the teriyaki burger.  Both were amazing.  Great location!"}
{"text":"Had a free burger coupon from the newspaper so we went to try it out. The burger was ok, but nothing special. Fries weren't the best either. Nothing sets this place apart. The setting is very California - surfer pictures, palm trees set against an ocean view. I will say that the staff went above and beyond. They had staff constantly monitoring the dining area checking in to see how your meal was and if there was anything else they could get you. We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed! Not a lot of seats."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the charbroiled Habit burgers!   Love the portabello mushroom burger, very juicy and tasty with great sauce!
Order the side salad instead of fries for a healthier alternative and no salt on the beef patty.   This is a brand new stand alone location with a drive thru located across the Cannery Casino on busy Craig Road."}
{"text":"First noticeable thing was a design flaw where the area to stand and order is too short and can only hold few people otherwise you stand outside the door.   The person taking the order was new and took a long time to take order but the place is new so it's almost  expected. The sourdough bread instead of the regular bun was good but over greased.  The pickle inside was too salty. The burger tasted great and so did the citrus tea. Nice outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Terrible burgers and chicken sandwiches and big disappointment. We had this chain food before off of McDowell and 7th Ave. It was enjoyable there but for some reason in the 2 years since this new Grill opens up and the food quality is not even close to meeting the price."}
{"text":"Nice new gem near the neighborhood. Very fresh, great options, and super busy at lunch!"}
{"text":"Regular habit burgers are nothing special, they taste similar to fatburger but more healthy or a better quality mcdonalds burger. Fries are delicious and so is the strawberry limeade. Would actually give 5 stars BUT I ordered the #1 which already includes fries and a drink for $7. While waiting for my food I notice the cashier punched everything in as separate which is .60 cents extra. Whatever no big deal, but the fact that she did that made me wonder if she did it purposefully and if she does it often. She seemed really suspicious to me. Also when I was getting my drink, another customer asks same girl where he can get some ranch. She wasnt busy at all and was right next to the register and told him to ask the cashier. He stares at her and she realizes no one is there and gets him one, so idk why she didnt just get him one immediately. Came again with coworkers and got the chicken teriyaki burger which was surprisingly delicious! They come here often and they say their salads are good. Will come back to try other things, but the cashier made me suspicious. The girl with the tattoos was so friendly as was the manager and another girl. That particular worker just...."}
{"text":"I have had one of the best burgers here. Yummy! I had the fresh strawberry lemonade.  It is light and refreshing. The burgers are huge, I couldn't even finish mine. We had the fried greenbeans, man o man they are delicious."}
{"text":"Just as good as I remeber them from California. Would rather have a burger from here over an other chain."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger. I'm not one that really cares for burgers as the meat is always too greasy and lingers for hours but this meat is great! Shake is amazing too as well as the regular fries crispy! A must! Thanks for coming to the north part of town!"}
{"text":"Finally! California style BREADED onion rings (as opposed o beer battered-yuck!).  So yummy with ranch or BBQ sauce.  And super hard to find in AZ.  The fries are much better than In-n-Out's. The burgers are very good, staff is very friendly, and I think the price is very reasonable.  Only thing I'd improve upon is the bun, it's a little dry.  But overall a really good burger joint!"}
{"text":"I don't eat many fast food burgers. I was in the mood for one and was told to try Habit Burger. I went for the Santa Barbara burger. 2 patties, avocado, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. Comes with grilled onions which I can not eat. The sourdough bread it comes on is grilled nicely. This for me was probably the tastiest fast food burger(s) I've ever eaten. The marriage of the cheese and avocado with the meat was outstanding. Very moist and juicy. Habit Burger will be my go to fast food burger joint."}
{"text":"Boom! Just had an amazing burger. An amazing shake and Frys with some super delicious strawberry lemonade. All I know is that I if you don't come here your a crazy person. Well worth it every time. I've been here now 4 times and have picked a different burger each time. Every time I discover this place can do no wrong."}
{"text":"burgers here are grilled to order which is a solid plus.. 

overall its a mix of fast food and sit down as the orders do take 6-12 minutes. 

I've gotten the charburger and the chicken sandwhich.. the burger was solid with a good balance of all the veggies and the cheese and patty. The chicken sandwich was terrible.. dry bread, the chicken patty was terrible quality and extremely dry. I feel like they used the pre-grill marked .5inch thick blended and pureed chicken mix. 

they had a nice selection of teas and juices 

i'll be back for a burger probably once every 6 months or so since it wasn't that great but this location is convenient for a lot of the errands i routinely run."}
{"text":"Went with a group to this place because I've heard the hype and we've got several around town now.  

I asked for chicken recommendations and the girl said the chicken club and I asked for side recommendations between the tempura green beans and the sweet potato fries and the girl offered the half and half, so that was a nice option.  I appreciated that.  Since it was hot summer, I just opted for water.  My total was over ten dollar for a side and sandwich, no drink.  

The chicken club was fine, but it was more of a blta.  Most of my sandwich I couldn't  really find the small grilled chicken, however,  it had plenty of bacon and avocado, so it was still good.  It was served on grilled sourdough.  It was a good size sandwich and I took half home, but am a small eater.  

The sweet potato fries were standard.  The green bean fries were a fun addition for a fast food.  I like places that have options rather than just fries.  

Not sure that I will be returning, not because of anything wrong.  Just nothing memorable and a few bucks higher than other fast food.  I didn't \"drool\" over any of the other items I saw.  

Staff were helpful and professional and dining room was clean."}
{"text":"Habit Burger is an easy choice when i want a quick & tasty meal.  

I really enjoy the Habit Burger chain.  This location keeps the momentum going for a return visit.  The employees here are friendly as soon as you walk through the door.  A friendly greeting and smile goes a long way.  The dining area is clean with condiments well stocked.  

While I do love their burgers, I also love their chicken sandwiches.  I enjoy being able to order it on toasted sourdough bread instead of a bun or roll.  The items are made fresh and the quality seems to come out in a positive way.  Of course I can't shy away from their sweet potato fries.  They are always optimal for my taste.  

The diversity of their 'burger chain' menu is quite tempting.  Aside from the burgers and chicken, a variety of salads and even tempura green beans are an option.  One of these days I will have to try a decadent shake!"}
{"text":"So freaking AMAZING! My very first to me here and I got the Portobello Burger, Onion Rings and the Fried String Beans. I mean it was just the right size burger. I also got the Peach Ginger Nectar Juice. OMG So BOMB, I could go there Everyday just for that. The customer service was on point from taking the order to giving me my food. If you haven't been, it's a must you go! Can't wait to try other items from their menu!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great and tasty burger than this is the place for you. I ordered the double char burger, fries, and a vanilla and strawberry shake.  The burger was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. The fries were a little too salty and I would have preferred the shake been a little thicker. The service was very good and the cashier made sure I had everything I needed. I'm still giving this place 5 stars because of how the burger tasted"}
{"text":"I mean this.... It's the best burger I had in my life!! I love the teriyaki burger and the tempura green beans are AMAZING."}
{"text":"The Habit Burger was one of the MOST delicious burgers I've tasted! I got the Charburger and my husband got the Double Char. Very good food and the prices are really reasonable. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Yay they finally opened one closer to home! I've always been a fan of this place because I've always had great experiences! I decided to stop on in for my burger fix around 8:30 pm on a Wednesday and eh it wasn't busy. The cashier was friendly but a little slow. The line behind me was getting long and it was only him at the front. Idk what the lady in front of me was ordering but she took FOREVER. I felt like the man behind me was about to flip as he kept huffing and puffing as we were standing in line. 

So finally I get to order our food. Two mushroom burgers and the Santa Fe burger. I get my pager and we go sit and we wait... wait.... wait... and waiting.....
As we're sitting there waiting, mad people kept coming in from the drive thru with incorrect orders or missing items from their orders... ugh! FINALLY at 9pm, THIRTY MINUTES LATER, we get our food. At this time we we had given up hope that we were ever gonna get our food. I'm not sure why this took forever as there were about 6 people in the kitchen and it wasn't busy. I got my food and no \"sorry for the wait\" nada. Rude..

Anyways a helpful tip:  Don't come and eat here if your starving! You might pass out from hunger because they make you wait."}
{"text":"Had my first Habit burger and was very pleased.  Burger done just right, add or delete toppings, fries just out of the fryer and were great, onion rings were good but a little too crunchy for me.  Will make this my first choice for a burger from now on.  Pricing not too bad.  Happy that they have Coca Cola products!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Just went for the first time. Burger was awesome. Fries are great. Make sure to ask for a side of ranch. 

Decor is nice. Service was quick and friendly. I'll become a regular I'm sure. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Heard about this place, so gave it try!  Absolutely delicious!!  Served hot! Ordered a double mushroom char burger, Onion rings and Tempera green beans. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place and overall it's an okay place. The sause and toppings aren't as good as other Burger places."}
{"text":"First off I go here all the time, this will be my last. The girl in the front taking orders is a total sweetheart. Love her. She has always be so nice, attentive and sweet. However I went there tonight and requested my burger without cheese, which I always do, and the cook put cheese on it. The young lady wanted to make me a new one even make me one to go but I told her it was fine because it wasn't her fault. As I walked away with the burger the incompetent, arrogant, cook was told by her that I didn't want cheese and I hear him say \"he'll be fine\" very rudely. After I finished half my burger, didn't even care to finish the fries I left and told the cook that next time he might want to wait before the customer is gone before making such rude comments especially when he was completely in the wrong. Next time i'll hit up Five Guys. Lame. Broke this habit."}
{"text":"One word....Amazing! A coworker and I had been meaning to try this place so for lunch she went and got us some burgers and sides for lunch....I had a mushroom char burger with avocado and a side Caesar salad the burger and mushrooms were cooked perfectly and the avocado was very fresh ....my friend had the burger on sourdough bread and got us fries and the tempura green beans as well...Everything was extremely good across the board...We highly recommend you stop by and indulge"}
{"text":"Sometimes, ya just need a good old American burger. Being from Tempe, I'm pretty loyal to Chuckbox but a friend told me I had to try The Habit and I loved this place! I ordered the traditional cheeseburger...they use american cheese, mayo, thinly sliced romaine(5 Stars for that!), pickles - and the best part - the meat was perfect for me. Not a big fan of beef so I liked the size. I forgot to mention - all this wrapped up nicely on a sesame seed bun. 

The photos of Santa Barbara hanging on the wall threw me off... but after a quick Google search I realized this place isn't a new kid on the block and just some corporate chain. It has a cool story and brothers bought out a burger joint in 1969 in Santa Barbara (obbbbviously) and have recently branched out. Very fresh ingredients....will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The last time I was in this restaurant it was a Pizza Hut! But it's now a Habit Burger Gill and it's terrific!  

The hamburger was great. The service was fast and easy. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. The only problem they have (and the Pizza Hut had it, too) is the parking lot is small. But since most of their customers are pick-up, the cars come and go quickly.

Yes, I recommend you try The Habit Burger Grill."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time for lunch today. Got the Santa Barbara burger and fries and water. The fries are very good they got a nice thick mouthy feel and texture to them.. the burger was also pretty good though the ground beef overall was relatively bland, but the assembled burger was quite tasty. I would give this place four stars except they have a partnership going with DARE (YES REALLY!!!) and there's two stoned morons out front taking donations for DARE! is there anything more pathetic than a 30 year old government program that was proven ineffective being purchased by the private sector!. Maybe I would take it more seriously if it looked like those two idiots could actually pass a drug test. and maybe it's a bad joke like the burger is addicting but really come on now! When they get rid of those two DARE morons and their toy drive, my review will go up to four stars. And by the way, for completeness, I should mention that the Yelp app sucks. It nags and nags for a review, despite the fact that nagging for reviews violates their own TOS."}
{"text":"Normally I write longer reviews but there is not much to say.  The Habit is a step up from fast food but it's not a big step.  Customer service was average at best.  Burgers were flavorful but not wow inducing.  Average price, average service average food."}
{"text":"I just moved to Southern Highlands and found this place on Blue Diamond and Decatur. I love it. Great burgers and the onion rings are awesome. Give this place a chance. You will be happy."}
{"text":"The short review: solid burger place.

The long review: super clean place with friendly staff. Our order was out in about ten minutes.

The burger patty itself was cooked well all the way through but still super juicy. The closest comparison would be an In-n'-Out burger plus extra ingredients and a lot cheesier.

I got a Mocha malt as well - it was thick enough without being a chore to enjoy. A criticism I would have is that the mocha flavor was a bit buried under the chocolate syrup flavor, but the remedy for that might be just getting a coffee malt next time. And this criticism does not change the fact that the malt was fantastic.

I had fried green beans, which I thought were a pretty good alternative to fries. It isn't for anyone who shies away from greens, though. I probably won't grab them next time and instead opt for fries or onion rings, but they were a pleasant and interesting choice none the less."}
{"text":"This was nothing special at all. I will not be disappointed if I never go back here. I would have preferred Chipotle or even In-n-Out Burger. The food really had no flavor. The sodas were flat. I had to dump out my drink twice and opt for ice water. Service is nice and friendly. If you eat clean, this place is NOT worth the cheat!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I grew up on in n out, and honestly i would come here first! The burgers are always amazing and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about. Just an average burger and fries and a bit overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Crispy Fries & Juicy Burgers. That's The Habit in a nutshell. If you're from Cali you already know all about them. Thankfully North Vegas has one now. 

Located in the strip mall off Decatur & 215 ( not the Costco side). Parking can be a bit tricky since there's always traffic coming from all directions (Walmart/BofA/U-Swirl/etc.) but you'll always find a spot, it'll just take you a while getting out. 

First thing I noticed, the set up is a bit tight. Not enough space to form a line to order or pick up. You always feel like you're in somebody's way. And since it's smaller than most locations and very busy, tables are in short supply. Unless you want to sit by the door and have everyone watch you eat while they stand in line. That's not very enjoyable. My tip, take it To-Go. 

But aside from that, the food is pretty good. Kids meals are affordable($3.99) My kids like it but they said they prefer In-N-Out instead. And I agree with them. But you be the judge."}
{"text":"I had the double burger, my wife had salad and chicken sandwich.  Everything was really good and I was all in under 18 bucks! That's a good deal for great food!"}
{"text":"First time here or to this chain.  I am visiting from California.  Very happy!  Very good burger and fries!  Clean restaurant and polite helpful staff.

Because of this visit I will definitely be trying The Habit at home.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Received the worst costumer service I have ever had in my life. Waited in line for about 5 to 10 minutes to be told I'm not allowed to order anything without any explanation. So the 5 to 6 people in front of me can order food, but I can't? Guess my money isn't good enough for your company."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday and I was impressed with how good their charburgers are. The meat to bun to toppings ratio was spot on and the burger was flavorful. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Good burger joint from Cali, prices average for a burger joint. Good service, and not too crowded."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing and delicious. It was made fresh and the burgers were so juicy. The place is clean and the staff are all very friendly. It's an upscale version of other burger joints with great music playing. We were curious and wanted to see what the buzz is all about The Habit and it was not a wasteful visit.we will definitely visit this place again. A very well recommended place from to everyone."}
{"text":"Came here and the sign said they closed at 11pm and it was 10pm and the doors were locked and the workers inside stood there laughing and it was the rudest and worst experience of my life. They made motions for us to drive home and I was shook."}
{"text":"Three stars because as of this very moment this location closes at 10pm on a Sunday but once I parked it was 9:30, this female worker decides to LOCK THE DOORS 30 mins earlier and put the CLOSED sign. 

Now I don't know if this is how it technically is but I don't think it's right that they closed & locked the doors 30 mins prior to closing. My intentions were to eat fast and get out of there as soon as possible. The food is great but I'm disappointed. 

Other than that, I always get the California Club and it's always made amazingly but I work in food & beverage and everyone knows that when you have guests that come in 1hr-30mins prior to closing it's a pain honestly but you just deal with it because that's the way it is."}
{"text":"I always get the Santa Barbara sandwich it is so good! I love this place so much and I come for my lunch break all the time! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Kind of been there, done that. I gave four stars because they are very clean and polite. That always rates high in my book. Chicken burgers and hamburgers, drinks and shakes. It's is worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious! Everything was fresh, the burger was fantastic. The fries were crisp cut, and hot. The salad was fresh and very tasty. The ranch, you could tell it was homemade. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken sandwich witch was amazing I give it a 4 out of 5 the bread was slightly under toasted but that did not take away from the flavor. 

I had a chocolate milk shake as well I also give it a 4 of 5 tasted great but not spectacular."}
{"text":"This is my first one star rating by not eating in an establishment. It's 10pm on Saturday night, the posted restaurant hours say it closes at 11pm; however, the lobby is already closed with other patrons inside. That's not how to make money folks."}
{"text":"Lemme start by saying if you are capable of slapping a burger on a grill and cooking it then you've got virtually no reason to go here. Unless you have neither a grill or ground beef. 

At that point though you'd be better off going with almost any other place that has burgers. My \"Double Char Cheese\" double cheese burger was akin to what I used to get at my high school football games. Lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, and caramelized onions only really added color to the over powering taste of dry charred meat. The fries were generic lightly salted deals with nothing special. They do offer sweet potato fries that I did not try.  It wasn't horrible or inedible but I wouldn't go back. In-N-Out across the street does this classic American meal much better."}
{"text":"I decided to try a new burger restaurant, it's new to me at least. It was so clean and nice inside. I decided to try the veggie burger and fries and my daughter got the chicken nugget kids meal. The menu inside has all the calories on it for those health conscious people. Good to know sometimes! They also had a little Buffett of chili peppers, jalapeños and pepperocinis along with ketchup and little cups for the ketchup.

The veggie burger patty was very good and I like the wheat bun. I ordered it as is this time. Next time I will probably get it without the cucumbers and honey mustard sauce, it just didn't taste right but everything else on the burger was great! The fries were the right amount of crisp and not soggy like some other burger chains. 

The kids meal came with a cute little candy burger. The chicken nuggets were moist and flavorful."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The first time I had to have the char burger - my friend and I split the tempura fried green beans and onion rings.  The second time I had the tri tip.
I don't understand why the burger and tri tip were so messy - ie dripping with something....what were they dripping with?  Why so messy on a fire grill?  Idk.  
It was delicious though!!!!  I LOVE the tempura fried green beans and onion rings.  Although on my first visit we were given more than on the second visit...hmm.  
The tempura fried green beans are unlike anything else I have had.  The onion rings are delicious especially because they are so crunchy!  Both dipped in free of charge ranch are amazing!   
I was a little disappointed with the tri tip.  I added portobello mushrooms to it, which were delicious.  However, the tri tip in certain spots was impossible to bite into and chew.  There were clearly some very hard fatty spots :( ....so I most  likely won't get that again.  I saw another review which said they were very generous with the meat....I did not feel that way on my visit, however.  I got mine on the french roll (which was yummy and toasted) but when I run out of meat and still have bun...to me that's not a complete sandwich.  
I want to mention that on my first visit, our burgers were just sitting there getting cold while we waited for the sides.  When an employee noticed that I was pacing and eyeing the burgers, she brought them out and apologized.  So now we had luke warm burgers and piping hot sides.  
There is a LOT of chatter from the employees talking with one another.  Perhaps if they had less CHATTER they could pay better attention to their customers and why they are there.  Just a suggestion.  I am all for people having a good time at work, but you can hear their conversations the entire time you are eating ....and frankly it's a little annoying, especially if something goes wrong with your order."}
{"text":"Good food but they keep it too hot in there to enjoy your meal. We've been there twice in the last 2 weeks and they said they were working on it but they're apparently too cheap to have it fixed properly. Also, they have empty tables but they rarely wipe them clean. Gross.                                       Jen B"}
{"text":"I know......another burger joint right. You think you've been to one, you've been to them all.
This was the best burger, the best service (I know a burger place with service who knew). Cooked fresh. Yes....you will have to wait a minute or two while it cooks, but so worth it. This place has a Restaurant atmosphere, not a Fast Food Joint one.
Do your self a favor and cut the \"Fast\" out of fast food and try a burger worth wait for. It was so good. I had the #2 with a side of onion rings. Yum..."}
{"text":"Habit burger... The food was tasty but I can tell you this burger will not be forming any habits with me. While I love Chargrilled burgers this burger pales in comparison to a place I grew up eating out in El Paso, Texas called Charburger or now as it is called Charcoaler. The habit gives you little flavor or anything out of the ordinary to form a habit. I give the location three stars for the kindness of their staff, good music and a little different flavor. I was not blown away as I thought maybe I would be but then again I think the person who recommended it to me is new to chargrilled burgers. I would recommend that if you are ever in El Paso to please look the place up I spoke about and try it. Just try one of their original burgers with the pickles onions and BBQ. I swear you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I came here because everybody told me it was a great burger, and it really did not disappoint but I wish there had been a bigger burger menu. 

I had a regular cheeseburger and it was fresh, cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. 

It was also fast and the staff was friendly, I'll definitely return here."}
{"text":"I like this place! The staff was nice, the place was clean, and the food was fresh n yummy. 

I had the double charburger, fries, vanilla shake. The burger was nicely flavored and the toppings were fresh. The fries were pretty damn tasty. And the shake was creamy and had homemade whipped cream on top. Yum!

I am definitely going to be eating here when I want a good burger. :-)"}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service and awesome food!!! We stopped in for a burger tonight for dinner and my boyfriend asked for no onions on his burger. They accidentally put onions on it and so he took them off and continued to eat it. He said it was so delicious!! The manager, Darcell, noticed he was taking the onions off so he came over and apologized and gave us a coupon for our next visit. He was so kind and sincere. Great experience and the food is always good at Habit!!!"}
{"text":"I've dined in and used their phenomenal take out ordering service. Their burgers and veggie burgers are the best I've ever tasted. Their French fries and onion rings are so tasty. I've tried their special salads and I'm complete satisfied and satiated. The Habit is on my speed dial."}
{"text":"Great prices great service and even better burgers. Love this place. Ordering online makes it too easy"}
{"text":"Bf got to go for me. 

I ordered the albacore tuna filet on sourdough bread. I loooove the bread, it didn't get too soggy despite the travel. Tartar sauce was great, although it had a lot of onion essence, I didn't mind. The tuna was overcooked and very firm but not too dry. I was looking forward to a succulent filet that melted in my mouth. They did more than sear it which is why I docked a star..

The fries were great. Thick fries which weren't crispy but rather had a soft interior which I prefer. They're like bendable.

He got the double charburger and I tried a bit of it. Wasn't dry at all. Buns at In-N-Out are better than habit's sesame buns cause they grill theirs a bit.

Next time I'll try the Santa Barbara"}
{"text":"Great food....friendly service....clean and stocked....I want to give a super big shout out to Cory....he came to our table to ask about the food... Made us feel super welcomed...had a very pleasant conversation....made sure we would be going back ....it was refreshing to say the least....thanks again Cory for making our first visit a excellent one!!!!   See you soon"}
{"text":"Fast food is apparently very hard to not only be consistently fresh and good but it's apparently even harder to always give great service.  Habit not only does these things but does them EVERY time.

The Habit has to be the best chain fast food burger spot in AZ.  Many chains come with hopes and dreams of being the next best thing and they usually start out great and then quickly fall to pieces.  Not only has Habit delivered but their fries are much better than some of the better burger chains out there.  I also like the fact they have a good selection of drinks, a bar with jalapeños, peppers, and chiles.  

If they could open a few more spots in the valley I would be all for it.  Great work!"}
{"text":"STOP WARNING! Well this is a first, out of all the fast food restaurants The Habit Burger Grill has always been a place that both my husband and I have been faithful to, to visit due to their Customer Service and their fresh food choices. Unfortunately the last few times, that we have had to get it to go, the food was absolutely horrible...Yes all you lovers might want to bite my head off for saying such a thing but this is all too true. Placing the order and what goes into the bag (and you can ck it all you want, looks can be deceiving)  is a lot different then when your eating there, and if something isn't quite right you can bring it back up to the counter and have it possibly corrected. Twice now the food tasted stale and not fresh. Both of our side salads were limp, blue cheese...sour like spoiled milk, my fresh tuna sandwich smelt like it had been sitting out on some dock for days and then placed on the grill...fishy, no condiments were put on the sandwich, like it should have been, soggy from the container not being sealed properly and that's not even the burger potion of my husbands meal, the meat tasted to him like day-old left over night counter meat, also no condiments were put on the burger and it was NOT ordered that way, the fries were cold and over greased. What! and we are home ready to eat this and it was completely disgusting...Like I said this was not just the one time, this is now a 2 time offense and guess who foot the bill for both of these orders...OOOooooyeah! my household. Habit what has happened, not once, but twice and there will not be a third. This is negligence and unprofessional, someone could of got really sick if this food could of even been consumed...Shame on you, you have lost our business and at one time we actually really liked your establishment."}
{"text":"By recommendation of someone who said In'N'Out Burger throws off one of her internal organs and not The Habit, I drove the short distance to check it out.

I was impressed with my Burger/Fries AND I *loved* the interior - doesn't feel burger'ish style; more contemporary decor. Very Nice. No drive-thru, walk-in only. Friendly staff.

I will try the chicken next with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"We made it a habit! We love the chargrilled burgers here. They offer salad, chicken, tritip and tuna options but the burgers are so consistently good that I have not even been tempted to try anything except my usual!
I get the Santa Barbara style char: two grilled patties, cheese, fresh avocado, tomatoes, lettuce and grilled onions on sourdough. I get my bread dry, because it can get messy with cholula that I drizzle over everything. Most of the time I eat this with silverware. 
The significant other and myself usually split an order of fries (which are always hot and crispy).
The restaurant has a patio for eating your meal outside, and they offer ice cream and milkshakes, if you are into frozen dairy desserts. Staff always seem to be in a great mood and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru at 11:30 on a Tuesday with two cars ahead of me. We were in line almost a half- hour. Sheesh. We don't mind as long as the food is fresh and tasty but this is far longer than I waited at the other locations. Even with the wait, at least the service was very friendly.  

We live very close and the tempura green beans were fresh, crunchy and great with ranch (duh. What isn't?). My teriyaki burger was lackluster at best today. The meat patty covered a very small portion of the stale, hard crumbly bun. The pineapple was still cold and chewy. I probably looked like a dog with a chew toy eating it.  The pickles and sauces were good and I like that they didn't skimp on tomato slices. 

Still better than McD's, but no where close to touching 5 Guys, Culver's or In-N-Out or even the other Habit locations. Bummer. Hopefully, we can chalk it up to a new restaurant ironing out their kinks. We would give it another try and eat there."}
{"text":"I've seen the sign for the drive through from the street, it said open late so I decided to come here tonight.  Turns out that they close at 10pm.  For a fast food restaurant, especially one in vegas, open late does not mean closed at 10pm.  Worse, they have their signs still lit up and their menu box still running so there was no way to know that they were closed, which wasted more of my time in the drive though."}
{"text":"I know i know... Everyone is comparing this place to in-n-out and habit seems to be losing... But i gotta say.... I'm one of those one in a million weirdos that does not like in-n-out...omg *gasp* say it isn't so!!! When i first moved to Vegas from Texas... All my friends from Cali told me i had to...i mean i HAD TO try in-n-out... And i was so not impressed and after trying them multiples times... Getting fries extra crispy... Animal style... It's still eh to me...

Anyways, this is not a review about in-n-out.... BUT i had to put my 2 cents out there...:) 

Habit Burger Grill on the other hand was fantastic!! The burger had a great char flavor to it... It was juicy and the toppings were on point. I had the hatch green Chile char with extra lettuce. And it was amazing... So delicious and with the hatch chilli's it had a little kick. 

On my second visit i had their BBQ bacon burger...bbq sauce was good...a little on the sweet side but the saltiness from the bacon counteracted the sweetness and it was a great bite. Yummy!! So far i have tasted 2 burgers and they have been dabomb.com!!

And they have a chili bar with jalapeños, pepperchinis and yellow chili peppers... Yummy!!! 

My bf had the Santa Barbara and he said it was delicious and it looked yummilicious with all that creamy avocado!

Now onto the sides... We had the fries.... Yummy! Perfectly golden and crispy... Tempura battered green beans... So good... The tempura batter gave it that crunch and the green beans were perfectly cooked. The onions rings.. Wow.. if you love onions rings get some. They were just perfectly crispy with tender onions in the middle and the flavor was dead on.

I can't wait to come back try the other burgers... And be on the look out... They seem to be running specials that change. The hatch chili burger was a special..."}
{"text":"Oh my god, MOUTHGASM. 

That is literally the best description I can give in regards to the flavors that tickled my taste buds once I took my first bite of a Habit Burger.  The meats are so juicy, and the veggies are so fresh, I can't believe I've ever settled for less, before. The fries are just the right amount of crispy and flavorful, without the overdose of salt. I honestly just couldn't get enough. 

My favorite part of this place is the ability I have to customize just about anything on the menu. On my last visit, 2/16/15, I ordered a veggie patty with swiss cheese and a side of fries. I'm not even a vegetarian, but DANG! That was one tasty veggie burger!! In addition to what is prepared behind the counter, many of the condiments and \"side offerings\" on the flip side are equally as wonderful in flavor and variety. 

To top it all off, the customer service here was great! The man who took my order was all smiles, very welcoming, and friendly. 

While this place is a bit on the pricier side of the spectrum, you ultimately get what you pay for.... and that's just pure bliss."}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint! The burgers taste great especially that santa barbra style. The only reason i didnt give a full 5 star was due to how long the drive thru can be sometimes. I was waiting almost 20 mins one night and there was only two people in front of me. Great tasting burger though"}
{"text":"Complete hype .. I don't get it. It's Carl's Jr. basically. It's nothing special , and I won't return .  The fries are normal and nothing special . Only have American abs Swiss . Which is white American . Gross 

Stay away.. nothing special 
Hit up fat burger or in and out"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw this restaurant as we drove by on our way to Cafe Rio but we decided to stop by and give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of their food and the options that they have. I have been there quite a few times ever since our first visit and the staff is always friendly and courteous. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Probably should stick to burgers at this place, but tried a grilled chicken ($6) and those are not good anywhere usually. This version used good thick sourdough bread (you get a choice), but loaded too much mayo and poor quality tomatoes on the sandwich. The chicken itself was a thin cutlet, but seemed a tad undercooked and had fatty sections. You need to eat that separate just to be safe and make sure it was all cooked. One teenager cannot handle the entire grill at lunchtime also, so beware, but also always order a burger at a burger place.

One ISSUE - They only cook the burgers to medium well. I don't trust a fast food place that doesn't cook to well."}
{"text":"Better than average fast food burger spot. My husband is from Santa Barbara where the habit was from & says it is the same flavor & quality as the original locations. Very convenient that it has a drive through. Everything on the menu is delicious. Their salads are large & fresh ingredients, especially the lettuce. Their chicken sandwiches are huge chicken breasts grilled fresh."}
{"text":"Very delicious hamburger & sweet potato fries! Burger was tasty yet remarkably light. Comfortable outside seating, courteous service. Will return if there is ever one in my local."}
{"text":"If you are going for lunch expect to wait. We where lucky we got there at 11:30 and watch the line grow. The place is busy but the food is great and the staff is very friendly. It was a nice day so we sat outside on the patio. I  give them a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Fast service and REAL charcoal grill flavor.  The only thing I don't like is that sometimes they run out of seating and in the summer, sitting outside is NOT fun."}
{"text":"I am a regular at the habit because I work next to it and I get they're double char burger with a mocha milkshake so goooood!"}
{"text":"So the line when we went was long but it went fairly fast. I ordered a lettuce wrap and had to look at it for a good 5 minutes before I could decide how to tackle it. The avocado was more of a spread taste. Added bacon that they forgot as well as my daughters ranch. Overall my meal was just ok. Nothing amazing by any means. I saw this when I left Skinny Fats and was excited to try it but do not think I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time eating at Habit and left satisfied. Restaurant was slow around 5pm on a weekday. Burger was cooked to order and tasted fresher than other fast food burgers like McD's, Burger King, etc. Reasonably priced menu. I'd prefer In N Out, 5 Guys, or Shake Shack, but their burgers are still good. I'd eat here again if convenient. Clean restaurant, accessible/spacious, friendly staff, and quick service. Their sweet potato fries are nice!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch recently. Good burger. Just not really worth the $10 cost. Plus it was extra for cheese.

Received fries but less than half full of the carton. Not what I was expecting.

Good location place but not sure if I'd come back unless someone from this location would address the fry situation for all of us."}
{"text":"So this was my first time going to one of these Habit burger places and now I see why that is what they are called! It might be part of a chain but I will definitely give credit where credit is due.

I have eaten so many burgers across the lands and I never thought I would say, on this day, this is the best burger I have ever had. Perfectly prepared, amazing flavor, the meat, the spices, the way the chese was truly melted. Everything was like a symphony of flavor. Their drinks are phenomenal as well. We tried both the ginger peach nectar and the strawberry lemonade, which were fantastic! 

My SO got the veggiw burger which was gigantic and was kind enough to share. I am not usually a veggie anything guy but even that was just ao flavorful and fulfilling. All the ingredients so fresh, especially the pickles.

Watch out In n' Out, if these places keep popping up you might have a true run for your money!"}
{"text":"The burgers are very juicy and the portions are not over board.  Just right.  Good lunch or Dinner burger.  I prefer it over Fat Burger.  Loved it."}
{"text":"I had a grill chicken sandwich.  Tasted fine, but nothing to rave over.  The French fries were average.  I  expected better from a place like this that is supposed to be better quality food than a fast food restaurant.  Staff was very pleasant and helpful.  I doubt I will be back for lunch again."}
{"text":"I finally went to try the habit burger. I love it!! Very delicious burger and fries. I had the charburger with swiss cheese and french fries and sweet potato fries. Everything was pure awesomeness definitely a go to place for eating burgers !!"}
{"text":"this place is well decent the service is good the food isnt my favorite but its still pretty good it was the first time ive been there so i wont judge it too much either way it was pretty good not gonna lie like i said decent"}
{"text":"For a burger place their food is very good. I especially liked the onion rings. Service was prompt, and the people are friendly and you get your food rather quickly. I've been here a few different times. And plan on returning."}
{"text":"Wifey wanted cheezeburgers so I had the chance to try out Habit burger. 

I dropped 20 bucks and was full and satisifed with the taste of everything. The bugers were good as can be for chain express style resteraunt. The fries were fresh and hot and the green beans were really good. I will get the green beans again next time and probably try the tri tip. The salads are also intruiging. 

The coffee milk shake was better than i expected."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, the staff was courteous, and the food was delish!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars, this place is a joke, they forget stuff everytime I go through the drive thru. The food is decent but the service absolutely sucks, I've gone twice now and they have forgot complete burgers and when I call them they pretty much tell me to go f*** myself. Hopefully they close the doors so a real establishment can take that spot. Beware if you decide to risk going here."}
{"text":"Had a burger, chicken sandwich, sweet potato fries and a drink. It was really good but a lil pricey."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a burger and this was close by. I really went plain, meaning, burger and pickles on a bun!  The bun was toasty and I liked that but the burger didnt have much flavor on its own, it was just ok.  I do love their onion rings though, mmmmm."}
{"text":"Had never been here before but thought I'd give it a try. It was excellent! Extremely fresh and delicious. Clean facility and very friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"My only disappointment with The Habit is that it's so far away from me. Seriously. 

I was in Tempe to get my hair cut, and had some time to kill, so I went into The Habit to check out their menu. I ended up ordering the mushroom/swiss burger, and was pleasantly surprised! 

The mushrooms were fresh and sauteed when I ordered. The burger was pretty damned good for \"fast food\" (it's not the drive-thru variety--these are grilled to order, but it's not a gourmet burger establishment).
The cheese was perfectly melted, and although the beef was a little over-done, it tasted amazing! 

When one compares the quality of burgers from places like The Habit and Culvers, it makes you wonder how McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's stay in business. 

They're adding locations in Paradise Valley and north Scottsdale, thankfully. For now, I\"ll drive down to Tempe to cure the burger itch!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying The Habit and it was really good, the meet was great the bread was perfectly crisp and the service was incredible! They came up to us asking what we needed with such a positive attitude. Daniel is really really nice and attentive. Really everybody here is so nice and the cashier knew everything from the menu so she was really informed about the menu which was great for me cause it was my first time so 100% recommend this place and will definitely come again"}
{"text":"This place brings some new excitement to the PV Mall area. Menu includes Grilled Burgers, Sandwiches and delicious sides such as Fries or Onion Rings. They even have several Fresh Salads as well Shakes, Malts, and Sundaes.

Inside is very clean and the service is quick and friendly. Seating is somewhat limited and it can get pretty busy. Just bring a friend to eyeball a table while ordering. Tables turn rather fast.

Cheese Burger, Cheese Burger, Cheese Burger, No Pepsi and a side of Onion Rings. Triple CB with everything actually for me. Wife did the single Charburger and some Fries. Super COOL condiment bar with a great selection of chili peppers and hot sauces to jazz things up a bit. Helped bring it up a notch or two.

Burger were pretty tasty but lacked something. Seemed as if the burger patties were made ahead of time and possibly frozen before cooking them. Tasted a little too lean or dry and did not melt in my mouth like I was expecting. Maybe I just like my burger a little more greasy and smashed. Ha!

Would be nice if you had Hot Dogs added to the menu. You got the grill going already and who doesn't like the DOG. Maybe should also consider getting rid of those outdated flashing beeper thingys that tell you when you order is ready. The number system works fine and you do not have to rewash your hands after returning it to get your meal. Hmmm?

Give them a visit and check it out. ORDER UP!

3.5 STARS"}
{"text":"I have to laugh at the person that stated the service was bad. I have now been three times (can you blame a gal for craving a burger?) and each time everyone is almost too overfriendly. They ask if you have been in before and if you state no, they offer to go over the menu. Now this might stop after this location has been open longer, but it's helpful since there are only a few locations in the valley. When your order is ready, you are paged and you go up to grab your meal, and they always find it necessary to read back your order, when right in your hand is a tray with a juicy burger begging you to take a bite... so I am always a little feisty for them to read it off, since I want to chow down! They also seem to want to check in on you while you are eating, which is nice... but can be overwhelming if you are on your lunch break and trying to catch up with a friend... but I won't complain about good ol' polite customer service. 

I order their original char burger without cheese and without the onions (I did try them with the onions and honestly, I liked the taste of the burger better without)

I like their crispy onion rings, they seem healthy if that is even possible for an onion ring... but they are crispy and not greasy. Try them, you'll understand what I am saying better :)

The fun item I always get \"to go\"??? Their coffee flavored milk shake. It's light, it has nice flavor and is a little bit of heaven.

PS: Parking is not like it was with \"My Florist\" there are many more available spaces now, which is totally awesome."}
{"text":"Abated to try it so we did. As hungry as we were as we haven't ate anything! The food was just ok. The restraint was very clean and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Really good burgers. Onion rings were amazing."}
{"text":"Not your average burger joint! Their great Yelp rating is definitely well deserved. Inviting, clean decor, friendly staff and most important -delicious food!

I had the Char burger with sweet potato fries. Burger was very good, not greasy (huge plus for me) and the charbroiled onions added a nice flavor. Sweet potato fries were awesome. Hubby had the tri-tip sandwich with teriyaki sauce and fried green beans. I was apprehensive about the beans, after recently eating a disappointing similar dish at the Red Rock movie theater. But these were outstanding! Again, not greasy, crisp batter and seasoned perfectly. They were excellent with or without the side of ranch.

The setting is similar to a Chipotle/Smashburger, quick casual dining, as opposed to a fast food restaurant. Spacious booths, free condiments like banana peppers and jalapeños, and three types of iced tea were the icing on the cake!

They also have a drive thru, which could be dangerous for me. I see a green bean drive thru in my near future!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken club its gas great the only down side is they didnt gave me my ranch dressing for my onion rings plus my onion rings had a fish flavor."}
{"text":"This hamburger is now my new favorite in Las Vegas. The hamburgers are made to order so the food is hot and fresh. All of the veggies are crisp and fresh as well. They have a variety of peppers at their condiment area which my boyfriend really enjoyed. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have a Habit for burgers.  This place always hits the spot and I never leave I satisfied.  Prices are affordable and food quality is great!  I am often tempted to try other sandwiches i.e. The chicken club, tri-tip, or Tuna, but I can't bring myself to get anything other than the cheeseburger.  

Service is always really good and they are fairly quick to ring my buzzer.  

I'll be back and my waistline is cringing."}
{"text":"1st time here and I was met with a great experience over all. The place looks great, smells greater and serves tasty burgers. 
I'm a typical burger guy but not the casual Mc Donald's or BK slop. A co-worker suggested this place was good and were insisting on paying for everyone. 

I ended up ordering a chicken sandwich with seasoned over fries and a root beer. Customer service, ambience and menu options are gonna get me fat again, I will be back. Im gonna not eat here daily lol."}
{"text":"I just don't see why everyone loves their burgers so much. They don't stand out or have anything memorable about them at all. It's like a homemade burger, which is good... But I wouldn't want that at a restaurant. In N Out has more of a memorable, stand out flavor. The decor and the staff are lovely. I really enjoyed the specialty drink they served (I think it was peach, ginger and mint lemonade?)."}
{"text":"Went to the \"new\" Gilbert location last Sunday afternoon well past lunch time. We are long time habit burger fans from CA and are familiar with how great the food is. We were excited a location opened near us. 

First off the place is grossly undersized and it was packed. We waited about 10 minutes to order. During our wait several people came in and immediately took a table even prior to ordering. IMHO very uncool. 

When it was our turn the person taking our order was so easily distracted, even stopping in mid order to run over and yell out what we ordered. She returned and finally took the rest of our order, took our money and gave us the vibrating chip. 

At other habit burger locations when they are slammed with lots of hungry customers queued up for tables the staff circulates, they collect trays, and politely ask the patrons if the need anything, the unstated request is please allow someone else to have their table. The Gilbert location is so small it's more of a satellite store designed for drive thru not dine-in. They do have tables out front, but zero shade. Here in AZ that is very poor planning, and a discourtesy to their customers.

When we arrived we noticed several people who were finished with their meals, and were lingering as if this was a Starbucks. Unfortunately the staff here was oblivious to the fact that about 2 dozen people including us had ordered and were queued up to find a seat but no one was leaving. 

When our order was ready due to the unfortunate lack of inside seating, we ended sitting outside at a sun drenched table in 100+ degree weather. Between the time we first walked in, to getting our order and quickly finishing our meal outside, the people that we spotted going in, were still sitting when we left. Management needs to find a polite way to turn their tables. If they can't there will be a lot of first time visitors deciding not to return just as we did. 

Before going to \"Yelp\" I contacted habit burger directly, right after our bad experience. Almost a week later not a peep from them, so I'm going public with our experience. 

As an aside we were using a gift card, and after paying we asked if the card was a one time use or was reload able. The order taker had no clue but said she could ask a manager but never did. Since the card was used up we just threw it away. 

The meal was delicious, and had the people running this location been more proactive with the table squatters, making some effort to keep everything moving this review would have been all about a great experience but no such luck. If you visit this location strictly use the drive thru."}
{"text":"I asked for a water cup and I got a regular cup- instead of the see-through one right next to it that was clearly the water cup (sometimes they give these as a means to say- here you go).  I was waiting for a salad that I paid $10.00 for and decided to get some hot peppers on the side.  I took a bite of the sport pepper and it set my mouth on fire.  I took my \"water cup\" and put some of their peach lemonade in it to quickly get the burn out.  When I picked up my salad, the manager made a comment \"are you going to pay for the lemonade you took?\" I said \"uhm, what? sure, here I will pay for it.\"  He then said \"no its ok, just saw you take some lemonade with your water cup.\"  I said ok, here is money I am sorry and he said I dont want your money.... so I said... why are you trying to stand behind the counter and call me out on something that isnt even that big of a deal and yet you are making it a big deal, and then I apologize and offer to pay to which you refuse.  I do not come to restaurants to order a $10 salad and given snide comments  - It was so unprofessional I will never eat here again. I see my fault in this- but terrible way of handling the situation."}
{"text":"Good, freshly cooked burger. Just got the basic burger and I would put it above all the normal chains. The addition of carmelized onions at no charge on the burger was a key to distinguish this place from other joints. It probably falls right below Five Guys, but if you need a freshly cooked to order burger fast, this is a logical choice."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru few minutes ago and ordered a chicken sandwich Santa Barbara style which should have grilled onions and avocado...the person taking my order confirmed this twice....I come home excited to have dinner after a long day to find out it's completely wrong. It was just a plain chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce, lettuce, tomato and pickles. So I called the phone number listed and was told they are the \"order processing center\" and can not do anything and no way of connecting me to the actual restaurant. She did not even apologize and said I can either drive back to the store or write a complaint on their website and someone will contact me in 48 hours.  I asked to speak a manager and sat on hold for 5 minutes before Kim got on the phone and said there is nothing she can do.  This is very disappointing for a well known business."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and will certainly not be making a habit of it. The fries were nothing special, the menu confusing (you choose from different options to make your sandwich) and the end result was nothing to write home about. My chicken burger was over fried and my partner's fish sandwich was the smallest he had ever had. The sandwiches were ready at different times, so we ate separate meals. The drink refills gave it a 1 star."}
{"text":"The Habit is my least favorite burger joint and makes me angry when I see it's name. 1) The name itself is trying to give me diabetes, encouraging America to make fatty beef a habit. 2) The menu is whack. IT DOESN'T EVEN LIST OUT WHAT COMES ON THE BURGER/SANDWICH/SALAD ETC SO IM OUT HERE GUESSING WHATS IM GONNA GET ON MY CHARBURGER. 3) BUT OH NO WAIT, YOU GET TO THE CASHIER AND YOU HAVE THEM TELL YOU EVERY GOD DAMN THING THAT COMES ON WHAT YOU ORDERED WHICH IS A WASTE OF TIME WHEN IT COULD BE PRINTED ON THE MENU. 4) The cashiers start interrupting me asking bout some lettuce, cheese, tomato ok and would I like to add avocado? Like hold up and wait your turn to talk. 4) The pager you get for your order is dumb. This isn't Olive Garden, just give me a number or take a name. 5) The \"Famous\" chili bar. FAMOUS CHILI BAR MY ASS. EVERY TIME I WALK PAST THAT THING ITS FULL AND GOT COBWEBS ON IT BECAUSE NO ONE USES IT. 6) THE PACKAGING REALLY FUCKS ME UP. You'll order one fucking burger and get a huge ass plastic container with a lid and a piece of lettuce with a fucking orange slice on the side, taking up half of the container. WHAT IS THAT FOR. Get some more size appropriate containers and package things more efficiently. 7) The uniforms are outdated and dull, I feel like I'm looking at a hospital wall when I see The Habit polos. 8) The food is trash. The buns suck. In summary, The Habit is unsatisfying, illogical, wasteful, crappy, outdated, and inefficient."}
{"text":"What kind of place requires you to pay over the phone when doing take out? Make me pay when I come in seriously? Also the phone system for these guys, totally not personable. Literally robots or people who sound like robots taking your order. What happened to the good days where people cared about serving you and providing a service for you? Whoever answered the phone was a total jackass."}
{"text":"Picking up burgers for a work lunch.  We ordered online @ 11am, Habit confirmed an 11:30 pick up but when I got there at 11:30 no food was ready.  In addition they weren't able to provide a paper receipt need for my employees years expense report.  Food ordered at 11a was finally ready @ 11:45.  (We're talking about 6 burgers)."}
{"text":"This place is slipping. They never seem to get the order correct.  Last night, nearly stale hard french bread on chicken sandwich.  Will write an update regarding a subsequent visit."}
{"text":"Yo take mah fat belly's word to yo mama on dis here jamz.

Cheap tasty burger.  Aint no 99 cent mcdonalds burger but who eats that shit?

Fries are like Britney Spears without makeup.  Something is missing.

Rings be like Britney Spears with makeup.  7/10.

Green bean tempura thingies.  Bomb.  Like Mariah Careys boob job or slip n slide on a hot day.

Take that nasty wannabe tri tip away from me.  Like meat jujubees.

Chicken sandwich are decent but Carls Jr is still better and so is Jack in the Box but only during lunch hours otherwise theyll F that S up faster than a homeless man on acid thinking that American Beauty plastic bag is $100 bill.

They get a A for effort for the lettuce wrapped versions a B for execution and a C for the mayo they will drown yo shit in if you dont ask for that egg n oil on the side.

Sneakiest thing about this place are the cheap bomb salads.  Kinda brilliant. Salads are A+ for what they are, price, and because its a burger joint.  And who the F orders salads at a burger joint?  That one picky vegan or whatever who is cool to hang with but ruins coworkers collective lunch options on the 'boss is being a dick lets collectively drown our sorrow in processed meat day.' 

Good spot.  Order the lettuce wrapped char hold the mayo be a proper gent and ask for mustard then get a salad or green beans as a side and youll be aight."}
{"text":"Ok Habit...your food is delicious and service is generally fantastic, however, today you forgot my bacon!  Unacceptable!!!  Not a happy camper at all when I got back to work from my very short lunch break to eat a boring ol lettuce wrapped cheeseburger sans bacon!  The green tea also taste like soap :( not a good experience today and NOT worth 10 dollars for this lunch."}
{"text":"Great tasting burger with grilled onions on top.  Tempura green beans could have used a little more breading, but were still very good.  I will  be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family and it was a big hit! The reviews led us here and the burgers didn't disappoint. I suppose you could say they're along the lines of in and out burger, but possibly slightly less \"fast-foodish.\" Fries were good if not exceptional and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"So i have mixed feelings about here. We ate there Tuesday. it was 16 for the two of us. So it was busy there and my first concern was there was no place to sit. Not much else to complain about. They're a bit trendy, the menu offers different types of burgers including Tuna. The menu is simple so thats good too. 
The burger itself,  im sorry to say, wasnt anything special.  I also think for aprx 3.00 for an onion ring side, they could put more than 6 onion rings in the order? 
I think they will actually do well just because they do offer more options than a burger. The staff is young and they dont interact much but the place is ok, ill try it once more for something other than a burger so stay tuned!"}
{"text":"The Habit is a good change from normal burger joints. It's like a classy, \"Carl's Jr.\" Their menu is OK and the service was decent. The parking during lunch time is tough so get there early."}
{"text":"Happy crew in Avondale with a lot of dialogue in the kitchen. Clean and pleasant dining area. Burgers look great! I loved the pickles and veggies proportion to meat. The bun was sturdy and had good texture. The charburger patty was substantial, but not particularly flavorful. It was an alright experience."}
{"text":"Nothing more to say but great burgers and oh yeah the onion rings were pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"Stop Reading these reviews and just go try it if you like hamburgers you will not be disappointed if you like salads you will not be disappointed oh and fries too.)"}
{"text":"my new favorite place!!  never a wait as we order online, the order is always perfect and hot when we get here. Only quick place I can find our fav tempura fried green beans!! To make it better all the workers are so nice and really know how to treat customers.  thanks you guys for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"Best place for a burger that you don't have to pay $12.00 for a burger! Great company!
This business pays more attention to details than most high end eateries, even down to the take out convenience! It doesn't get any cleaner! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"The Habit was a fun experience. Cassie, one of the hostesses/cashiers, was extremely friendly and gave us a tour of the entire menu. The burgers were cooked perfectly, but they were relatively small for the price. If you are looking for a filling meal, order any of the \"double chars\" (aka double patties). We split the Santa Barbara and the Mushroom char and had some onion rings (which you should order), making for a delicious meal at a semi-fast food place with a quirky history."}
{"text":"Let me just say the food here is amazing! But dear lord this place is slow as molasses. It takes 15 minutes to get through the line and another 15 minutes to get your food. I have a 30 minute lunch break so I can't take lunch here. If you have the time to wait give it a try."}
{"text":"This is not the first Habit burger I've been to but this location has the best customer service. Everybody from the cashier to the ones going around cleaning the table, by far good burgers and tempura green beans."}
{"text":"I took off one star not because of the food quality, but the service. The burgers are great and the French fries are omg, so delicious! This location is new so I've only been there 3 times and every time I've gone, the employees seem so down, not all of them but most. Like they dread their jobs. I get you may not have the best job, but just put on a smile for the customers? Other than that, I really enjoy it and it's super clean!"}
{"text":"Finally turned and parked to try rather than drive past and boy were we happy!  Ordered the Santa Barbara Double Char with onion rings and green beans. Fried yes- greasy no. The burger reminded us of a patty melt and again not greasy. It's a lot of food and did keep well for leftovers a few hours later (avocado didn't turn black and yucky). Cannot wait to come back and further explore the menu (or maybe just stick with the awesome original). Oh & you cannot compare The Habit to In & Out. Both are equally great!"}
{"text":"These burgers are great; juicy, large, and I love the caramelized onions on top. The option to skip a bun and instead wrap said burger in lettuce leaves is great. Though at times I wish there was a gluten free bun option. Other than that I'm pleased with the place."}
{"text":"The Habit was just A-OK in my book. 

Service- Friendly and quick. I was in and out within 5 minutes even though all my food was cooked to order. The cashier was sweet and friendly. The expeditior and I assume manager who bagged my food was very sanitary. I saw him apply hand sanitizer to his hands often, and saw him wash his hands after changing tasks. He was also very friendly and gave me extra ranch for my sides.

Decor- Very modern, clean space. You walk up to the counter and order and they give you a pager while you wait for your food. They have a condiment and drink station to the right of the register, with strawberry limeade, soft drinks and a pepper bar consisting of jalapenos, banana peppers and yellow chilies. There is a comfy couch to sit and wait while your food is being prepared, and comfy booths or tables if you want to dine in.

Food- I ordered the Santa Barbara burger, onion rings and tempura green beans. The SB is their double char burger on sourdough bread, with avocado, cheese, mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomato and grilled onions. I also order the tempura green beans and the onion rings. I'd say the onion rings were my favorite part of the meal. They were hot and crispy, and had a nice crunchy breading. The tempura green beans were boring. There was no crunch, they were just limp and tasteless. The burger was just okay. I did appreciate the fresh avocado, and there was lots of it. But the avocado overpowered the flavor of the burger because that is all I tasted. I also don't like pickles on my burger and should have asked for them without, but can't fault Habit for that cause it was my bad.

All in all I am glad I got to try this place, but not somewhere I would rush back to."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! For an inexpensive lunch or dinner, I recommend it.

We always get the char burger with cheese and a side of fries with ranch. While, I can't  compare their burger to Zinburger or Deluxe, for the price you can't beat the quality."}
{"text":"Came here after running the Rock N Roll Arizona Marathon. Ordered the mushroom char with bacon and a side of onion rings. Their Onion Rings are the best!!!! I really like that they have a giant fan on the ceiling, pretty cool!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers at fair prices. Their onion rings are awesome (with a very generous portion). This location sees a lot of foot traffic as its close to the Howard Hughes plaza but the staff is always super quick and friendly. If you're looking for relatively cheap but good food this is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"This is by far the cleanest Habit I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. The manager was constantly cleaning the fountain machine after each use.  We were greeted with a smile from the cashier and the food was awesome.  I will definitely visit again.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I love how easy it is to switch up your order at The Habit...as long as they don't get your order wrong. Haha!

I ordered a protein style SANTA BARBARA CHAR with no cheese but the hubby arrived home with a protein style cheeseburger with the basic veggies, they forgot to add the avocado. A little bummed out but it still tasted good. My hubby made sure he ordered the patty well seasoned since the patty can be pretty bland if you don't request it to be seasoned well. 

Overall, this is the first time they get my order wrong but it's also the first time I order one of their burgers, protein style and they did I pretty good job on keeping it neat since most other places tend to make it messy."}
{"text":"My husband drag me here for lunch as he knew my love for sweet potato fries. I was pleasantly greeted and being new to the menu, the staff was so patient. I had the Swiss Teriyaki Burger and it was perfectly cooked! The taste was like a gourmet burger but without the price tag!
I might have to cheat on In & Out once in a while to drive here!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost once a week, and I gotta say the quality never goes down. And the quality is really top-notch. I always get the charburger with cheese and it is probably one of the burgers I have had in Arizona, at least top 5. And their onion rings, are simply fantastic, i gotta say the meal is not complete without a side onion rings and french fries (which are also pretty tasty). But the one thing that really makes this burger joint worth checking out: their ranch. Apparently they make the ranch in house and it is amazing."}
{"text":"Was disappointed by my visit. I was excited for a good burger place to open up so I decided to try it out. I saw a few card in front of my so I figured my wait eould be reasonable....NOPE. 5 cars back in line took me nearly half an hour to order and get my food! AND when I brought it home the bun was stale and had been toasted too long so it was crunchy and gross. Overall, unhappy with the quality of food for the price. I'd rather go to Carls Jr and get a tastier burger for cheaper (that's how mediocre my experience was--I'd rather eat FAST FOOD)"}
{"text":"4 stars for a fast food joint say what?? I really like this place and probably eat here about once a week. My favorite thing on the menu is not the burger though, it is the Caesar salad. Yeah I said it. The salad comes with romaine lettuce (duh) parm cheese and croutons, and it comes already dressed. At first this turned me off because I like a little dressing with my salad, and thinking that someone else knew how much dressing I wanted seemed offensive. But said salad maker much love dressing too because this salad is not dry at all. Not only that, it's a HUGE salad and it's less than $5!! I usually add protein though, either tri-tip which comes with a teriyaki glaze, or ahi tuna. This adds a few extra dollars to the price but it is worth it! 

I don't always get a salad here, but I realllly don't care for the burgers. I do like the tri tip sandwich which comes on sourdough bread. Everything tastes better on sourdough. I also like the tempura green beans and the ranch is bomb as well. Try the strawberry limeade too, it's refreshing on these hot ass summer days.

One thing to note is the parking here SUCKS. The restaurant is located in a super busy shopping center off Blue Diamond/Decatur and there are a ton of surrounding businesses all jam-packed into this little corner. They do have a drive-thru but because food is made to order, you can be sitting there for a while."}
{"text":"Two words come to mind as I sink my teeth nigh a charburger!!! ...... OH MAN !!!! This place is my new bad habit!! The staff is super friendly, Hannah and Madelyn were awesome and super helpful and friendly!! Love the food here!! OH MAN!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I ever went here and I would say that I was pleasantly surprised they make your hamburger is fresh and the french fries are very good however a double with cheese and a drink is about $10 little pricier than in and out"}
{"text":"Took my kids here. My son loves this place! He got the kids cheeseburger and he ate the whole thing. My daughter got chicken nuggets. I tried those and those were pretty good. I ordered me a grilled chicken sandwich and then added avocado. They were so generous with the avocado I was impressed/happy. I feel like usually places will short change you with the avocado but not here, it was great. I also ordered fries and they her hot and fresh. I had the BBQ sauce with it and the sauce was also delicious. This place is a little pricy. I'd probably still come back."}
{"text":"So it is true, I work in the same complex, but the customer service is then best in town.  Not to mention the food is amazing... A HUGE garden salad for less than 5 dollars?!!!  Awesome.  Seriously, one of the best burger shops in town.  Whenever I come in and am trying to be good and eat healthier it is so hard not to get one of their burgers because they are so damn amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Even with my crazy Lupus meal plan I can get a good meal at Habit Grill. Love it"}
{"text":"Love this place but this time was no Bueno when my daughter takes out of her mouth a long plastic thread looking object. Called the manager over and was like oh sorry... We can make you another one like that's it.... Not a big deal etc... Then he sends an employee with my daughters new burger and a ticket for one free burger. Was the lack of concern and apology that was wrong. But dang couldn't even give her a free meal."}
{"text":"The burger was like I remember getting as a kid.  YUMMY!!  Service and employees were friendly.  Will definitely go back.  I had visited the Habit over in Walnut Creek area a while ago and was happy to see we had one here."}
{"text":"Food is great, the reason we gave it 3 stars only is because every time we go here they mess up the order. The first time, when they opened the cashier was rude. Had the worst attitude and ruined our order. The 2nd time they smashed our burgers. And didn't put anything we added on. And the same cashier was there and rude still. Get a job somewhere else if you are unhappy. we asked for guac and they forgot. This time, we asked no mayo and they put mayo. How hard is it to get a order right."}
{"text":"Been hearing many good things about this place and I finally had the chance to try it out! The burgers here are very juicy and well seasoned. I got the double original with fries and drink for 8$ (before tax). The service was great and they also serve sweet potatoes fries which are very good as well. Although Mariana who took my order was a little complicated.... but I think she was new. Besides that everything tasted very good! I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The peach ginger nectar alone is why I will come back.
The burgers taste like they are cooked outside on a grill and are juicy and delicious. A definite come back place"}
{"text":"This was a good burger and a good value, but until they build more locations, it is not worth driving halfway across town to get. Put a location near Fort Apache and Tropicana and I will probably become a regular."}
{"text":"My first time here and I thought the customer service was really good and the burger was really good too. I saw some people have some nice looking onion rings and I will definitely be back for their onion rings and another burger."}
{"text":"I love their customer service. I always stop in here to get a Burger for my husband. He loves them here. Their consistently good here. It still my go to burger place for my hubby. Their fairly quick too !"}
{"text":"Shakes - A+
Fries - A
Burger w/cheese - B
Staff - A++
Seating - C

When it comes down to the most important thing - the hamburger - for me In n' Out is still tops. Their Cheeburger with onions is just terrific. The Habit is very, very good, too. And Habit has better fries no doubt. And their shakes are better, too. But...

Needs more space for customers. Lot's of people standing around with no place to sit, inside or out. The outside had no shade. In n Out right up the street has a vastly better outdoor seating area.

This is am immense improvement over McDonalds, Burger King and other older outfits that sell some pretty crappy food. Welcome to Gilbert.

One other thing: TURN DOWN THE DAMNED MUSIC! It's too loud. I want to be able to talk to my partner, not have to scream over the loud music."}
{"text":"Delicious. Friendly.  Fast.  Hit the spot!  I had tempura green beans and chicken club.  My husband had onion rings and the tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"Just popped in with my son. The manager here tonight is amazing and the place is incredibly clean and well
Run. First time here- definitely will come back. Very impressed at how well run this store is!"}
{"text":"I tried my favorite fast food pairing (burger and onion rings) at this place and ... that's it, I'm hooked! The Santa Barbara char was excellent - the beef was juicy and flavorful, the fixins really fresh, and though the batter on the onion rings could have been lighter, the crunch and flavor more than made up for that. The eatery is very clean, the staff really friendly, and parking is ample."}
{"text":"I love a good quality burger with fresh ingredients and most of all I love a great burger that's affordable and comes with a smile and a warm greeting! The Habit makes in n out burger wish they were out of business. For the price, quality and overall value of this delicious BBQ bacon char burger cooked to perfection with out a ton of unnecessary add ons may be my new favorite burger at a chain or any other burger stand. Everyone here has a great smile on their face like they actually enjoy working here. I most definitely will be coming back here as often as possible and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a great burger and amazing fries at a great price with amazing service! I wish I could give more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Drive thru is super slow.
Recommend to expedite service....
Remember peeps it's hot out!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Wish Tucson had one if these. U gave option of a bun or thick sourdough bread for your burger. Best part!"}
{"text":"I had heard that this place was pretty good and was excited when one finally opened up near me.  The burger I got was well cooked although seemed to be lacking in flavor just a little bit.  I still enjoyed it though.  The onion rings were amazing and probably the best I have ever had!  The malt was tasty as well and made me happy that they had them on the menu.  All of this was relatively inexpensive too which was awesome!  The staff and inside of the restaurant were very nice and the pepper and sauce \"bar\" is a very nice touch.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"a basic burger, with some great flavor & a good meal. portioned slightly small, but mighty tasty. nice lunch"}
{"text":"I really like this place for their selection. I went to the drive thru and was pleasantly surprised by their menu. It wasn't just fries and burgers, you can switch out for a lot of things. I ordered the original with everything, tempura green beans, and nectar juice. Everything was soooo good especially the green beans. You could tell that everything was fresh and cooked on the spot. When I go back will try the sweet potato fries. Sorry I didn't take pictures it was too good to stop a take a pic....lol."}
{"text":"Amazing..the green beans were so delicious. Hamburger was very juicy..had to use numerous napkins! The place was super clean, which I always appreciate!"}
{"text":"It is already nice to going into a Restaurant and be welcome.  I have been here a couple of times now and I love their burgers. I always get the char-burger with grilled onions.  

They are really quick at getting your food ready and the staff is always smiling when they are working.  That is one of the reason why I like coming here because there staff is amazing and burgers are great too."}
{"text":"Hate the noisy fast food atmosphere and decor. That being said the veggie burger was fresh and excellent. Cucumber slices gave an unexpected crunch. Honey mustard dressing was yummy. Additional cheese and avocado put this burger over the top. 

Pleasant staff.  

If you don't mind standing in line to order then picking up your food you'll probably like this place."}
{"text":"Nice decor, but expensive.  Honestly I was not impressed...the food was very similar to Burger King.  I was bummed because I was hoping for a place similar to 5-Guys or the old Fathurger.
On a nice note, the sweet potato fries were very good."}
{"text":"Good Burgers, great milk shakes, and the onion rings were pretty tasty as well. Pretty good amount of food, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First time eating  at the restaurant. They were about  a third of the pound. It was tasty. Good service and reasonable  priced . Good onion rings. Parking lot was small. .I will  go again"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here (4/13/16). Loved the atmosphere! The staff was extremely friendly (which, to me, is a big plus). Genuine smiles. I was walking in with a stroller and one of the girls, I think her name was Jessica, saw me walking towards the entrance and she got to it before I did to open it for me. I'm assuming this because after I came in, I thanked her and she went to wipe down some tables. I stood in line for about a minute and then saw her come back to her register and she took my order. Great customer service! I didn't catch the managers name but he was also very friendly. He stopped by our table and asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. I loved that the food tasted fresh. The fries, omg the fries! Most fast food places you go to give you fries that have been sitting there for a while and are all dried up and nasty. Not here. We will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"1st time here and very impressed. Teller was very nice, helpful and great energy. Plus the food was really good. I will be here weekly."}
{"text":"You can't help but compare the place to in and out.   The menu here is a lot more expansive than the other aforementioned place.   

The pros:  not too busy, clean, very comfortable seating, friendly staff, prices are reasonable, and food portions are solid (you get a very meaty burger).  

The cons:   There aren't many.  It's a little bit more expensive than in and out but the value is there.  I'd say that a double double is equal to a single here.   So when you get a double charburger here is pretty much a 4x4 over there.  I didn't find it to be as tasty as in and out.  Fries are good for a fast food place but they definitely aren't anything to write home about.  I'm like 98% sure they were frozen like 10 minutes before I ate them.   But that's to be expected almost anywhere you go.   I would come back here if I was in the area and wanted a big, filling burger.   I like the feel of the place and the food is very good too."}
{"text":"Got a cheeseburger and it wasn't fantastic. It was equivalent to Carl's Jr or FIVE GUYS. The staff was friendly, and the establishment was clean....just not the best burger. However, the onion rings were pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. This location was very clean and the staff was extremely friendly. We ordered the Santa Barbara Burger and fries. The girls came by to refill drinks and take plates. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Don't know why the cashier would not cook a regular burger med well. They wanted us to upgrade to ahi tuna or tri tip. I am an adult and know how I like my food prepared. Would not go here ever again."}
{"text":"I wanna eat here every day for the rest of my life!! SOOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst burger places I have ever eaten do your self a favor and save your time and money food is gross and over priced if your craving a burger just go to smash burger wich is in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"Great Saturday afternoon lunch place out on the patio...CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN , great customer service right from the hello !"}
{"text":"Great staff here. I just moved here from LA and was tried this place for he first time. They walked me through the whole menu and gave me suggestions. I am now a customer at least three times a week. The best part of the experience is the excitement of the staff.  Thanks for being so awesome!!"}
{"text":"First part is my review of this location. The 4 stars is for this location/food. At the bottom is about their phone ordering system. 

I ordered over the phone for a pickup. They said they will make my fries when I arrive. When I got there they put my fry order in and gave me my cups. It took about 10-15 minutes just to get my fries. I could have just ordered everything in the store and been out in the same amount of time. The food was amazing as always but I don't get why the fries took that long if I preordered. They should give me fresh fries before everyone else in line since I called ahead. We go out of town a lot and when we do we always call in orders at places for pick up to make our trip quick. I don't know if I will order it again when we are in a rush to leave. 

Now about there call in order system. This gets 1 star. I called twice, the first time it took 10 mins to get someone. The automatic voice thing said you have to pay with a card. When the lady picked up finally she said \"how will you be paying today?\" asked if I can do cash at the store. She rudely says \"as the automatic system says debit or credit only\" lady. I heard what it said. But you asked how and I figured I would double check. Then she hung up on me after this. So I called again, took about 5 minutes to get through. This time a really nice lady answered. She was very friendly and took our order. I wish I got her name so I could give her a good review."}
{"text":"I go here like once a week. It's that good.

Easily the best burger in AZ. I am not cultured enough to say the world yet, but I would be surprised if I did have one better somewhere else.

Onion Rings are good. Too good. I often overeat. Fries are also good. I often overindulge in those too. 

My only complaint about this place is that it fills up around lunch time, and I have to wait a few minutes longer for my food. It sucks and I throw a fit, until moments later my food is given to me and everything is lost in the moment of pure bliss. 

I will go back. I have already gone back. I already made plans to go back again."}
{"text":"My teriyaki burger was a five stars. My wife got the regular char burger and it wasn't as good. 
Make sure to order the fries extra crispy."}
{"text":"Damn good burger. 
Fast and fresh with a ton of options. The Habit lets you have it your way with their custom built options. If you have not tried The Habit yet, we suggest you do. It could become your next habit.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I don't like to give a bad review to a brand new restaurant in the downtown area. I am all about supporting new & local ventures.
However, I have experienced better burger joints than Habit Burger. My husband had the Teriyaki Hamburger and I had the Chicken sandwich.

PROS:
-Clean
-Good parking
-Good prices
-Menu is fairly simple and straight-forward
-Nice patio area

CONS:
-Toppings on the burgers were not explained very well by the soft-spoken cashier, I had to ask several times what would be on it and repeat several times the things that I wanted removed (onions, mayonnaise).

-Service was pretty bad. My husband and I sat in a far corner booth so that we could chat and be alone. Towards the very end of our meal, as we were taking our last few bites, a female employee approached and asked if she could take our tray (which was resting below our other plates/utensils). We politely said \"No, thank you\". She said \"Are you sure?\" We said \"Yes\". At this point she lingered by our table and eventually responded, \"Really? Because I can take it right now\". And we said \"That's OK, we are still eating.\" And she walked away. 
First of all: Why does it matter? Our meal is almost over, anyway. It would have made sense to ask at the beginning, but not now.
Second of all: The customer is always right. 

-Burgers were just OK. You can get a tastier one at Smashburger or Five Guys for around the same price point. My chicken sandwich (with teriyaki sauce on a wheat bun) was good but not great.

Overall, the place is new & nice but the servers are clearly not well-versed in customer service. But I realize that as a new restaurant, customer service is the hardest yet most critical part to master."}
{"text":"Decent food for a good price. Not spectacular by any means but prices are good given the size of the burgers and sandwiches. The sweet potato fries are good, onion rings are average and the service is ok. Probably wouldn't go back though. Many other, better choices in the area."}
{"text":"I love The Habit. When I used to live in LA, i always go there for a burger and also I love their albacore tuna. So when they opened one here in Avondale, we got so excited!!! But what happened to the fries? They don't give you a lot. It's like a kid's size."}
{"text":"So I got invited back here by the manager a while ago and wanted to give an updated review on my experience. I ended up trying the Teriyaki Charburger this time around and found it to be much better compared to the original Charburger, which I found to be very disappointing. Their shakes are still really good as well.

I'm not sure if I would get the original Charburger with fries again but I'm glad that I gave this place another try."}
{"text":"Great fresh off the grill burgers. The place feels super clean and actually is. The staff are super nice. The fries are not greasy. Although their shakes are really sad. Could lift their game there. This is the place I think of first when I think of burgers"}
{"text":"What a fantastic burger! I had a double with cheese and bacon and it was probably one of the best fast food burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"This Burger joint was packed, with the line out the door on a Saturday afternoon. However, the service was super fast and friendly.
We had the charbroiled burgers with a side order of onion rings. The buns were toasty, the meat juicy and the cheese gooey. The onion rings were crispy and they gave us ranch dressing to dunk them in.
We will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"Habit Burger. A HABIT I DO NOT WANT.

Tonight after shopping up a storm with the Mrs. (buying up Scottsdale for christmas), we were famished, ravenous, hungry, starving, and running on empty. We thought... \"Let's try that new burger place\"! 

So after the umteenth jewelry store, it was late, real late, we jumped into the family truckster and gunned it over to Cactus before it blue-hairs could cut us off once again in their mad dash of the xmas frenzy we've battled all day. Pulling into a welcoming empty lot and slid into Habit Burger. It was new, clean, and looked appealing. I was excited. 

I ordered the Tri-Tip Sandwich with BBQ sauce (that I had to walk back up to get later). Sweet Potato Fries and a Chocolate Shake, No Whip (for that's how I roll) and the Mrs went for the Grilled Chicken Salad.

I ate what I could, except for the big ol grizzly piece of hard sinew that was found in my sandwich. I took it up to the counter to let them know and do I get a 'Sorry', or \"what can we do to make it better' ...hell NO. The counter persons just says... \"OK\". What, did I hear you right?!? \"OKAY\" that's it? well fine, I go to leave and as I turn at the door just in time to witness the counter girl showing the piece I left with her to her store manager and they both give me an evil look as I exit.

OKAY? NO, IT's NOT OKAY. I want someone just to say 'we're sorry.' They obviously are not. You just lost a customer for life, and I'll make it a HABIT never to return.

Eek! Methinks not. I wish you luck with serving sub-level product to the masses."}
{"text":"Good customer service, clean, yummy fresh food.....guess that's why it's a wait for the food

Downer: no smiling faces behind the counter. 
No free wifi, although it says it does on site.

*location is kinda hidden from Ray Rd, need better signage."}
{"text":"This place had great service and great food. I got the Santa Barbara Burger. I got the single not double it was plenty. The only thing I wish they had was beer lol  but would definitely come back again. It's close to a lot of hotels."}
{"text":"Great Service and the food tasted really good. place is clean . I had the  Double Bourbon Bacon Cheeseburger it's just a seasonal item but it is really good."}
{"text":"Update: when I went to the window, the cashier only gave me a burger and that was it. I clearly ordered a # and I said I wanted that # and I told the cashier I ordered and meal and she looked at me and put her hands to to head and sighed and said \"what do you want to drink\" which is ready rude. Maybe she was a manager because she was wearing a light blue shirt with blonde hair. I will never return."}
{"text":"This habit burger location is the original and it's definitely the best! The food us always fresh and delicious and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Habit for the first time.  I got the BBQ bacon char and onion rings.  My friend got the Teriyaki Char and fries.  We didn't have to wait too long for our food as we got there before the lunch crowd came it.  I absolutely enjoyed my hamburger and onion rings.  The onion rings were nice and crispy and not oily or soggy.  My friend's fries were nice, crispy, and tasty, even without salt.  I definitely will be coming back.  Now I just wish one was close to where I lived!!"}
{"text":"Second time eating at Habit, although first time at this location.  Burger was still delicious, but the onion rings had way too much salt.  There isn't too much seating at this location so we had to hover around a table, anxiously waiting for a family to leave.  My wife likes Smashburger a bit better."}
{"text":"Ppl waiting in line for free burgers on National Hamburger Day!"}
{"text":"The tuna on a French roll was really good. The tuna was a little dry but tasty.  The coffee malt was perfect."}
{"text":"I ate here after reading the rave reviews, and I found it to be just ok. It's definitely better than McDonald's, but I think there are even tastier options out there. I'm surprised that it was named #1 Burger joint in America, I would have chosen Five Guys or In N Out."}
{"text":"Oh I love it here. Been here many times. And always love to go back and dine. The sandwiches are so good and the prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to the store - past meals have been a coworker picking up orders for several of us.
The food has always been fresh and up to expectations.
The store was clean and the staff was friendly and efficient.

Not a bad option for a workday meal, but there is no wow factor for me - I doubt I'd ever go out of my way to plan a meal at Habit.

Burger competition is getting tougher in this town, and Habit just ranks as A-OK. 

Double char burger (no cheese), french fries, fountain drink = $7.20 plus tax.
I ended up throwing away most of the fries."}
{"text":"The place is \"industrial\" - I found the set up a little odd - line up to order, get a buzzer thing, sit, wait for the buzzer thing - get your drinks and open condiment station.  I am not a fan of open condiment stations.  The team members were cheerful.  Lots of smiling going on.  This could be because they just opened.  They are getting a lot of traffic from up the hill judging by the peeps I saw today.  Paradise Valley - Tons of Brophy kids - Veritas.  
I ordered a single burger, sweet potato fries and a soda.  The burger was really good.  It was grilled very nicely and was fresh and juicy but not runny.  I loved the caramelized onions - shredded lettuce - mayo - fresh dill pickle chip - I think that was it - very good.  The bun was even good.  The sweet potato fries - not so much.  They were okay.  Delux and Maizie's still are the best for sweet potato fries.  The have Coke products.  I am a Pepsi girl, but I can sacrifice when necessary.  The prices were very good.  Not at all expensive - in fact, I think they are cheaper than In n Out.  The two of us ate a la carte (we didn't get the uh bundles? or whatever they are called) - for around 18 bucks.  We were both generally pleased.  We will be back - maybe take out next time?
I was using a walker and tangled with the carpets a couple of times, but then, that is what happens when you have open condiment stations and self-serve soda.  Urghhh.  If you are on crutches or a walker, use the front entrance and have someone do your drinks and condiments."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and always have the best service. They are very friendly and helpful and if there is any tiny issue with your food or order they go above and beyond to fix it. Also, love their food! Their cheeseburger and chicken club are my go tos."}
{"text":"Super enjoyed the Charburger! Cooked just right! The fried green beans were an awesome alternative to fries, and DELICIOUS! Service was fast and friendly! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here saying how she thought it was better than in n out Burger! I was willing to give it a shot :) I got the BBQ bacon burger with fries while she got a cheeseburger and fried green beans.
The food didn't take too long to come out. Fries were super crispy and seasoned well. The burger was amazing ! The Patty was juicy and the BBQ sauce was nice and smokey. The bacon was perfectly crispy and the burger was put together very well.
My friends green beans were pretty good too and went well with the garlic ranch she got with it to dip. Pretty solid burger place for the price we paid !"}
{"text":"I got the feel of \"fancy Carl's Jr.\" I just didn't get the hype. The burger looked beautiful but the flavor was just sort of average for me. We went with a coupon and even with the coupon we paid twice what it would have cost at In and Out and frankly I would have much preferred eating at In and Out as the flavor is better. So for me it was over priced fast food...eh."}
{"text":"My husband was told to try this place out from a friend so after a movie we decided to try it. Of course the Yelp reviews were good. I ordered a chicken sandwich, drink and fries. My husband ordered a bbq bacon cheeseburger, fries and a strawberry malt. The person who took our order was very friendly and helpful. The food was delicious. We'll definitely be back and next time I want to try the tempura string beans. They looked delicious."}
{"text":"I come from a long love of great fabulous hamburgers. It first started with intro to In & Out and then has advanced to burgerfi, shake shack, and five guys. Yes everyone is a lil different and you can never say you go the same exact thing! 
Habit had the most fabulous Strawberry Limenade. I would come here just for that!
The char burger is relatively a basic burger, but with the addition of grilled onions. Grilled onions make everything better!
The combo 1 with cheese was plenty of food for one person and cost about $8. I find that very reasonable for casual fast food joint. The pepper bar was awesome! 
I would definitely back here if my favorite in & out or burgerfi weren't near by. I'm"}
{"text":"This is a healthier, although not completely, choice in terms of their grilled burgers. My favorite item is their fried green beans instead of fries. They don't list calories on any of their offerings as other burger places have started to do, so hard to tell how unhealthy it is. The Charburger is their standard burger and comes with caramelized onions, mayo and pickles. A lot of folks order the Double Char. They have a variety of salads, too, including a Cobb and grilled chicken. Prices are a tad higher than standard burger places but a little bit better too!  There is often a line at lunch and parking is sometimes hard to find at peak hours. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, so someone does a great job with hiring here."}
{"text":"What a great place to come for lunch. 
I came in last week and ordered their classic burger, I thought it was amazing, the sauce, the flavor, the cheese and the condiments just came together. I'm thinking about it now and my mouth is watering because I want it again. Usually when I order burgers, the meat will either be over cooked, so it has like burned ends, or it would be under cooked, so pink in the middle. When it comes to burger patties, I don't mess around with medium rare or rare so I like it just well done. Their patty was perfect. It wasn't over cooked or under cooked. So I'm very happy about it. The only reasons why this is a 4 star, is because they took about 25 mins to get my order and I asked for no onions, and there were onions in there. 
Quite a bit of time for the wait, I would say. Onions I could just take off. Overall I had a great experience. 
Definitely would come back"}
{"text":"Unlike the location I went to back in January in LaQuinta, CA this location in Vegas is excellent. Food is always fresh. Order accurate. Friendly staff. Delicious burgers. Perfect fries. I am HOOKED on the Teriyaki Chicken sandwich. My mouth waters just thinking about it, LoL. I would recommend on a whole wheat bun!!  Luckily there is one not too far in Jersey. Soon cannot come soon enough!!"}
{"text":"I love a good burger but usually hate fast food burgers. Well, not at this place! I finally made it out to Habit Burger and fed my burger craving. The food is very fresh and the meat does not taste questionable like at Mc. Donald's. I also really liked the fries and they are reminiscent of fries you would get at a sit down restaurant. Not as good as Five Guys, but better than Wendy's, Mc. Donald's, etc. The prices are also very reasonable and are about the same as other fast food places."}
{"text":"We went in today because my sister wanted some chicken nuggets. We ordered the kids meal and a teriyaki burger the service was fast we waited 5 minutes when we got home our fries were stale and the burger was cold disappointed I don't think we will return"}
{"text":"The food was awesome and tasteful and clean!!!! By far the best burger joint in Henderson."}
{"text":"Certainly not as good as it used to be , Charbroiled Burger was very Spicy and lots of Pepper added it seemed...Not to impressed with this visit"}
{"text":"The burgers are good. My kids enjoyed the chicken nuggets as well. My dad took us here because he likes it better than the burger joints down by the outlet malls. It's good but I'd say still on par with Smash Burger and Five Guys. If you are in the area and want a decent burger and reasonable prices I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"A good burger and a good price. The meat was cooked well and the options for condiments was much better than the typical burger joint. The place is pretty new, and is still immaculate and looks like it is organized pretty well."}
{"text":"Really great burgers and for cheap too! Actually filled me up for lunch and I'm always hungry. Service is quick, professional and pleasant. Right on the corner of the three way stop when you come into the complex from the light off Bell"}
{"text":"I have been in love with The Habit ever since my brother introduced me it in California! Their meat is cooked to perfection! With a lightly crisp outside and a juicy inside. I like how they automatically use grilled onions which are what I always ask for in a burger. Their fries are delicious but they also have some green bean fries that are to die for!
They're a bit pricier that traditional fast food burger joints, but the additional dollars are definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I was craving a hamburger & I ended  up trying The Habit...  The food is absolutely fabulous the hamburgers are grilled with a charcoal flavor they are very big and the price is reasonable$$"}
{"text":"I love the habit. The food is always fresh and cooked perfectly. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. 
This is our favorite go to place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Meh over priced. Wait time takes too long. They are trying to be a upscale fast food but food is mediocre"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3.5 stars, I would. This is a chain restaurant, with some really good and interesting options, like the ahi tuna sandwich and the strawberry cucumber lemonade. However my biggest issues with this place is service and sometimes cleanliness.

First, let me talk about the food. Like most burger chains, they have cheeseburgers, hamburgers, fries, onion rings, and milkshakes. If you haven't been here before, they told me that the sizing of their single patty burger is similar to a single party at in and out. They have specialty burgers, so look at the menu if you want to spice up your plain cheeseburger. If you're not a meat person, they have other options as well, such as fish or salad. Whenever we've been here, the wait in line is hit or miss. If you're in a rush, you can order online and pick up your order. The burgers are grilled in house, and it can sometimes be a little sloppy with the presentation on the tray. This also goes for the tuna sandwich that my parents have ordered. I think that they get really busy and it's just thrown together quickly without much thought on presentation appeal. I'm not looking for a fancy look, but it's nice to see things somewhat stacked evenly.

In terms of service and cleanliness, it is also a hit or miss. I feel like this location would be a lot better if they had more employees helping out. I usually see the manager working in all the various stations, and I think it would do better if he had a couple extra hands. It can be a bit of a wait, especially during lunch when there is a line as well as a drive-through line. When it's busy like this, that's when cleanliness can be lacking. There is limited seating inside but luckily there's outside seating. And cooler days, opt out to sit outside and get some vitamin D with your meal."}
{"text":"The Habit is an excellent burger chain! I tried the BBQ Chicken Salad and Chocolate Malt Shake. I know, I know! If I got the shake, I might as well have tried a burger. For your information, I got the salad because it sounded delicious not because I was on a diet - although it did only have half the calories my shake had. The shake was amazing! Chocolate with just a hint of that malt flavor it - was almost like a liquid whopper. The salad was great too and I got the BBQ/Ranch on the side so I mixed them together to make the most perfect dressing. 

The salad was crisp, fresh, and the chicken on it was charred which tastes awesome. In fact, they call their burgers \"charburgers\" because that is their signature flavor. I also tried the tempura green beans which were pretty good. They taste just like they sound, green beans dipped in tempura batter and fried. In all honesty, I missed having fries with my meal, so next time I would probably stick to that and skip the tempura green beans even though they were great. My boyfriend tried the Santa Barbara Style Char and said it tasted great, I was so full by this point I didn't get to try it. This is fine because it gives me a good excuse to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is my new Habit! Burgers were fresh, fries and rings were on point. Hands down the best burger even when compaired to In&out and the new Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Awesome! 5 out of 5 would reccomend. If you haven't experienced The Habit then you haven't tried the best. Vegan, vegetarian and carnivores alike have a hot spot for delicious food. 

I tried The Habit tonight for the first time and was blown away. For a fast food burger spot they are clean, neat and organized. There is varied comfortable seating available with an assortment of options on their menu. 

For vegans there is a portabella burger, veggie burger or a burger with no meat/ no cheese. So amazing! Fries are fresh, add on bar is kept clean and there is home made ranch available. 

Must try!"}
{"text":"Went to The Habit tonight and either it was a bad night for them or this location needed additional help. Ordered at 6:08 and got my food at 6:34. I ordered the new Caprese chicken sandwich before the picture made it look good. After waiting that long the bread was really soggy and the sandwich was ok. I usually go to another Habit so I feel 3 stars for this visit was partially because I normally love this place. The employees didn't seem very happy or friendly either. I am hoping this was just an off night and will try it out again in a month or so."}
{"text":"After months of seeing a few friends checking in here, I decided to come and check the place out. Their menu is simple and offer salads which is nice. Their ordering system is quick and easy. Walking in, I didn't expect it to be similar to a fast food establishment. You walk up, order your food and they give you a pager. The meals are fairly priced and they offer some delicious teas and juice. I saw that they had tempura green beans which I love anything fried green beans. As far as their burgers go.. nothing too special to set them aside from a five guys or Wendy's. Their green beans were delicious. Overall, it's a nice environment and chill place to enjoy a meal. Fairly priced and delicious green beans."}
{"text":"You'll be pleasantly surprised to see the prices of their burgers. Much cheaper than expected. When you walk in, it just has this vibe that they serve over-priced burgers....but it's the complete opposite. Nice atmosphere with deliciously cheap burgers that will probably bring you back for more. I can say I'll probably go back for more. And rumor has it they have some tasty ice cream treats. Next time though....."}
{"text":"Love this place. Reminds me of a bobs big boy, as their hamburgers are large and tasty. Burgers to me are burgers but what makes this place stand out above the rest is their chicken sandwiches and salads. the chicken sandwiches taste very juicy, not over cooked like a lot of places. The salads are huge, I've eaten them a ton of times and only been able to finish it once. Very balanced with ingredients and dressing. My favorite has to be the Cobb for the amount of good in it. Great amount of chicken, egg, avacodo and bacon. I'm drooling as I think of it. 

I think the drive through is a waste of time to make the food come out quicker but it's perfect when I've got my sleeping five year old in the car and don't feel like waking her. They've got lots of options for toppings and sides. The onion rings far outweighs the fries. 

I get how busy they get at lunch time. There's no where to sit and people literally stand at the end of your table til your finished. The tables aren't always clean too but understandable that turnover happens quickly"}
{"text":"The problem is the bun.  

It simply can't hold up to the burger and that's a problem.  The meat is tasty and it's very similar to an In and Out burger and I love In and Out.  If you're the same way, don't settle for an imitation, just go across the street to In and Out.  

I had the double burger and it was a disaster by the time I finished eating it.  I mentioned it to some of my new co-workers and they said the same thing, that they typically get the burger as a lettuce wrap (which doesn't solve the problem but the results are the same).

Ordered the fries and was not impressed at all.  In and Out fries are much, much better. These reminded me of a bag of OreIda frozen fries circa 1975 that my mother would dump onto a cookie sheet, say a hail mary, and slam into the oven at 400 degrees and hope for the best, knowing in her heart it wasn't going to be good.  Sorry, just bad.

Liked the ice tea and the jalapeno bar.  Seating is non-existent at the lunch hour, forced to sit outside in the 102 weather.  It was quasi shaded so I was only quasi irritated :)

Bottom line, just not my favorite.  Lots of great burgers in the Valley, this isn't one of them.  Go north three miles to Paradise Burger Company on Bell just off the 51 and you'll have a much better meal."}
{"text":"Always disappointed when burger places don't offer turkey as an option. They did have a veggie pattie though, and to my surprise, it was not a boca burger, it had real carrots and mushrooms coming out of it! YAY!  This was our first time here, and BF got the double char minus all the standard fixings, just meat, cheese, and added bacon. I had the BBQ Bacon with a veggie patty subbed on it instead of beef. We ordered fries, rings, and tempura green beans to try all the sides. Everything was good! The rings were super crispy and my favorite. They have a free topping bar that had chili peppers, jalapenos, and pepperochinis, lemons and limes as well.  We'll be back. So much freshed than than my fave fatburger."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and enjoy awesome food. I loved everything I ate from the refreshing Strawberry limeaid to the delicious hamburger and fries. Yummie yum yum to my tummie. If you haven't tried this place please do."}
{"text":"Whoa! Now this is what I call a BURGER! Great staff and great food.

Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We like habit burger. There are some good burger places around these days. Habit burger is on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Delicious. Ordered the double cheeseburger wig everything on it and I was SO glad I did. Fries were pretty good, so glad there was a drive through and I was able to eat in my car. Similar to In N Out but a whole lot meatier!! Loved the friendly and speedy service. Will definitely return and next time with the whole family."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  When I got home with my burger made wrong (I asked for no tomatoes and they put tomatoes on it) and the apple juice missing from my kid's meal I was not happy.  I promptly looked up the phone number to call and complain and was directed to a recording stating that I needed to email them to reach a restaurant manager?? Wth.  I am livid so I call back and choose the option to place an pick up order.  I explain my situation to the person that answers and request to speak to a manager.  She tells me I have to drive back to the restaurant to speak to the manager. Again, wth?? Am I on the show punked right now?  I will definitely be going back here, but NOT to eat there.  Instead i will be going back to request a refund for the missing juice to my kids meal in addition to complaining about the wrongly made burger.  Do not eat at the establishment if customer service is of importance to you! 0 stars.  And the food is just alright."}
{"text":"We first tried a Habit Burger in SLC and we loved it. We realized there was one right in our backyard so we headed out. The biggest gripe I have about this place is the lack of seating. Both times we have been in we have had to table stalk in order to find a place to sit indoors. There is this huge patio with plentiful seating but who wants to sit outside in the 108 degree Phoenix heat to eat lunch. 

The service is ok - nothing exceptional nor horrible. The food here is also ok - a few of our hamburgers were undercooked however nothing inedible. The restaurant, itself, is pretty clean considering that it is usually pretty busy. 

We like coming here for a quick bite however the seating situation is a huge bummer and will likely deter us from coming back during a peak time or any time on the weekend."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say there is anything special about Habit Burger but its a decent burger place. One thing I did really like is that they had some good options for sides, and a really great chocolate malt. I got the TERIYAKI CHARBURGER Grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce, crisp lettuce, fresh tomato,caramelized onions, pickle, and mayo on a toasted bun. I'd say it was lacking that teriyaki taste you usually get with this kind of burger. Was pretty plain tasting for everything that came on it. The burger itself was juicy and cooked nicely. I got the fried green beans and they were some of the best I have ever had! Nice and crispy from the tempura batter, and they had a really great tasting ranch for dipping. But my very favorite thing we got was the Chocolate Malt. REAL Malt. So so good and so rich. I actually would like to come back and try their salads that they were advertising. They looked tasty and then I would wash all those greens down with some fried green beans and a Malt. But I don't think I would ever come here if I were craving a burger."}
{"text":"My very first order turned out lousy! No dressing on their Santa Barbara Cobb salad, and the side order of bleu cheese dressing was just dried cheese crumbles."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this habit location since they first opened, it's been a recent breath of fresh air since the only other place to get a decent burger late at night around here is in-n-out. I recently had a complaint of them closing early, after filing my complaint online I was contacted very quickly by corporate and they handled my complaint. Then I was also contacted by one of the back house managers Lauren, he was very polite and handled the situation in a mature manner while also reimbursing me. No place is perfect, but they have great service and an even better burger. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"New place we tried
Food was very good service was great they couldn't do enough for us.
Place clean and bright
Price was a bit on the high side."}
{"text":"Overall, this place was unimpressive.  Get a sandwich next door instead.  The food is alright- nothing bad happened here... but the employees are... not helpful I guess you would say.

When we ordered, the cashier was very clearly untrained and kept pulling other employees to help her with the transaction.  Instead of a manager or another fully trained employee helping her she kept having to get someone else's attention to help put in our order and give us change.  I paid with cash... the cash drawer was open... and I'm pretty sure that the register tells you how much change to give me.  Why she needed help counting out change was beyond me."}
{"text":"How much of California's refuse must we take before we finally scream, \"That's enough!?\"  Really, do we need any more fast food burger joints?

I decided to give this one a shot, because I'm a nice guy, and I figured it should at least be better than In-N-Out.  I need a better burger option in my neck of the woods.

Unfortunately, this does not fit the bill.

First of all, I'm sure their char-grilled meat is great, but it's really hard to taste it behind all that salt.  This may have been the saltiest burger I have tasted since the one I had in Young, AZ, where I'm sure the top of the salt shaker came off when the cook was applying it.  Can you guys try using some real seasonings, or just let quality ingredients speak for themselves?  Maybe you don't HAVE quality ingredients.

I feel sorry for the reviewers who said this burger needs to be more greasy.  The last time I saw something this greasy was at the Jersey shore.

The fries were bland, unless you count salt as a real flavor.  I guess they needed that much salt to force my salivary glands to be productive enough to cut through those moisture-deprived starches from the freezer-aisle fries.

At least this place is better than Burger King.  But Burger King does not make me get out of my car.  If I'm eating a greasy, salty, unhealthy burger, I might as well make my laziness complete and have the burger arrive right at my car door.  I run marathons, I deserve to be able to sit in my car when I get a burger! (Q: How can you tell if someone has run a marathon? A: They'll tell you.)

I'm probably in the minority here... Americans love their salt.  I personally prefer a lower sodium diet that has real flavor and doesn't give me a stomach ache the next morning."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE Habits fan. Go there all the time in Santa Barbara, and other locations. This location is the first and only time I've been disappointed. Went in on a Saturday around noon. Wasn't too busy. Food still took way longer than other locations. When it came out, it wasn't even warm, and the ahi tuna sandwhich wasn't even edible. It was gross fish, and so over cooked it was basically fish jerky. They did replace it, but even the standby good double char was lacking. 

I was so excited to have a Habits close by instead of driving all the way to Ray/i10, but the drive it worth it to avoid this crap location."}
{"text":"These fries are trash. They taste like they've been sitting in a fryer all day. Idk what happened but last time I went, the fries tasted and didn't look so brown. Such a shame because I bought two fries since I expected the food would be consistent. I asked for a lettuce burger and all they did was wrapped it in paper. The juices ended up leaking thru the paper and paper bag which broke thru. All could've been avoided if they boxed it."}
{"text":"The employees are extremely friendly and helpful. I ordered the tri-tip sandwich which was perfect. Everyone else in my party are picky about their food. I.E. No pickles or tomatoes etc. Everything was to order."}
{"text":"OK hamburger stuff - yea, just OK.  I'll go to Five Guys in a heart beat before I return here.  The burger was decent; the onion rings I'd rather forget.  Oh - if a Five Guys isn't around point me at the closest Culvers"}
{"text":"I think this is the only place I will eat a burger(not a big fan of in n out).
I can't find one flaw in any of their burgers or side oh my goodness.
A regular burger is freakin great as well as a cheese burger but my favorite is the mushroom one! It was just love at first bite.

Also I can't decide if I love the onion rings or the fries more..you cannot go wrong with either decision so I guess it's alright."}
{"text":"Of the three different sandwiches we tried, the steak sandwich ranked third. The burgers were good, but when compared to Five Guys they weren't as good. About the steak sandwich: the chunks of steak were tasty but hard to eat on the sandwich. Either you get a huge mouthful or just toast."}
{"text":"I'd love for managers to read this review. 

My husband and I get to go orders on average 1x/week here. Every time we have to provide our full card number and expiration date to place a to go order. 

I understand if the restaurant has been burned by no show carry out orders but can you please do a frequent buyer program?  Also, placing our card on file isn't an option either in my mind. As someone in financial services, I'm not inclined to believe the security on software is something I'm comfortable leaving my cc with. 

That being said....still amazing, cheap food & shakes. We keep coming back even though it's a pain in the butt to order."}
{"text":"I've heard from many people this place was really good, perhaps the best burgers in town so I finally decided to try it out. I got the mushroom char burger with added grilled onions, my boyfriend got the Santa Barbara burger and my dad got a double char burger with added jalapeños. Needless to say everyone LOVED it. My burger did remind me of in&out quiet a bit but still very delicious!!


Also I went to the location on flamingo road which seems to have better reviews"}
{"text":"We love habit burger. We ask for Swiss cheese and double chars..they're grilled chicken sandwiches are a real piece of chicken breast..tempura beans are a must..coffee shake delicious"}
{"text":"Please keep in mind this is fast food however I'd say this is one of the best fast food burgers comparable to inn n out around. They have fresh jalapeños , pepperocini, limes , lemons , fresh teas and strawberry lemonade.
The quality of the Burgers are pretty good. They have patio seating as well.

They have a variety of Sandwiches, veggie burger, fried chicken sandwich. They also have the Santa Barbra which is a double char burger with cheese and avocado on sour dough bread.

Service 4 Stars 
Their service has always been pretty good, they do a good job behind the counter making sure they get your order right. I would recommend to get there earlier during lunch hours if you can. 
I've been to this place a dozen times and I've only had 1 negative experience and it wasn't with the food. I would recommend not leaving the brand new cashier in training by himself. As he didn't know what protein style was and also having a hard time getting through the line. After messing the order up a few times the cashier who usually takes orders took over for a 4th try. We were a little annoyed and it seemed to annoy her that we were bothered \"I'm just helping you out ok?\" Is what she said to be exact. 
So 1. Try and train your trainees at a more practical hour.
      2. If a customer is in not satisfied a snappy response is not the solution.  That is all !"}
{"text":"The Tuna was fresh and tasty. Pleasantly surprised for a fast food place. The burgers had a nice charbroiled flavor. French fries were good too. I love the various options for iced tea including green and passion fruit flavored. Service was friendly and food was delivered quickly so it was still nice and warm. No complaints about any of it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"By husband is a huge Habit burger fan and was dying to have one in the east valley. We went once, service was slow. It understandable when it's newly opened. The food was good, not great. He felt like the meat was frozen vs fresh. 

We went again a couple weeks later, this time through the drive through. The wait was understandably longer than typical fast food. We got home and the order was inaccurate. 

The other day he wanted a burger. I asked if he needed the feed his habit. He said \"eh. No. it just doesn't seem as fresh as it used to be\"."}
{"text":"Staff was very pleasant; burger was average. The bun fell apart making it difficult and messy."}
{"text":"While trying to order, I watched one of the dry cooks drop a spatula on the floor.  Then he picked it up and put it on the grill. I told the girl who was taking my order about it.  The other fry cool started flipping burgers with the dirty spatula.  She went back and talked to cook #2, who said it didn't happen.  She came back, I said 'it was the other guy'.  She didn't turn back around to take care of it.  I canceled our order.  We're now at Islands."}
{"text":"The burgers here are good with fast friendly service. The low rating today for dirty, sticky floors and dirty tables. The glass on the doors were dirty as well. I hope they pay more attention to cleanliness."}
{"text":"The burgers have always been delicious, using fresh ingredients and the right amount of seasoning goes a long way. The fries are nothing to write home about but they have plenty of sauces to dip them in!

If you are thinking of trying another sandwich that isn't a burger I would have to recommend the Seared tuna sandwich with a side salad. Both are light-ish and offer a great option for those looking to be somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Tempe location and in Orange County, both times I was very happy with my burger!

They are grilled to perfection and their choice of \"add-ons\" are really good!  I recently had the char-original with swiss and avocado, I'm hungry just thinking about it!

We also had an after dinner shake- perfect ending to the meal.  the atmosphere was nice and clean but really really busy!  We felt lucky to get a table, I'm sure in a few months it will slow a bit.  Thankfully the wait for food wasn't more than 5-7 min after placing our order at the counter.

Will for SURE be back!"}
{"text":"I've always gone to The Habit every time I visit California. It is almost a tradition. I got acquainted with this burger place ever since my brother suggested it during our expedition to California about 2 years ago. I was hooked. Now my dream has come true... There is one here in Las Vegas!!!

The quality is the same as it is in Southern California. The lemonade is perfect. The Double Char Burger with the works is juicy and you can taste the hint of char on it that is not overpowering. The fries was cooked perfectly golden, and the onion fries were crisp, but the onion inside was just right.

The closest one to us is the one in St. George, Utah, thank God they've opened one up in Las Vegas, and to add sprinkles to the icing, so to speak, it's a walk away from my work in the Howard Hughes Center!

Now if they can open one up near Mountain's Edge in Southwest Las Vegas, I'd be in heaven."}
{"text":"Sadly only giving 1 star.  This is one of the few locations I have seen with a drive thur which can be so convenient for some . Like me who at the moment can't particularly get around like I used to. 

I used the drive thur,  ordered a veggie burger for myself and a charbroiled burger for my mom along with fries and drinks. 
As I was eating me veggie burger it started falling apart. 
This normally happens when I get veggie burgers anywhere so this did not bother me. However when I was trying to put my lettuce back on my veggie burger I spotted a lady bug attached to the lettuce. Lady bugs were my favorite little bugs growing up but NEVER TO EAT !!! Needless to say the sight of the lady bug put terrible thoughts in my head and made me reconsider the cleanliness of this location, so I did not get to finish my dinner . 

My moms charbroiled burger's lettuce appeared clean and lady bug free however ! 

Word of advice to this location  , please be cautious and check the vegetables while rinsing and cleaning before servicing to a customer. 

I will not return to this location in the future . 
Photos below."}
{"text":"The Charburgers are really good! Everything on it including cheese & caramelized onions, then add bacon = heaven! This is a great place to stop in for some fresh tasty burgers & fries before hitting The Strip!"}
{"text":"Visiting for the weekend and found a new favorite place to eat. Full garden salad was very fresh, a little light on cucumbers and tomatoes. Very good overall. Grilled chicken sandwich was very tasty. Clean store, many happy people eating it appeared. Nice cashier who did a great job walking me through the options."}
{"text":"It seems like there is always another out of town burger spots with an established fan base opening up in Vegas. Next to do so, Habit Burger, with over 40 years of operation under their belts, brings their charburgers, sandwiches, and shakes from Southern California to the Valley. It kind of reminds me of Carl's Jr but a lot better, yet different, and I'm a Carl's Jr fan There's actually one right across the street if you're into comparing.

The Santa Barbara is probably my favorite. It's a double charburger with cheese and avocado in grilled sourdough. I don't know what I like the most about it the grilled sourdough, which I'm always a sucker for,  or the avocado. 

The Teriyaki charburger I liked. It came with a nice sized slice of grilled pineapple with mayonnaise, pickle, tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions. Can't really say no to teri burger with pineapple unless it was bad. Good thing it was good.

I've also had an albacore tuna sourdough sandwich. Different but I actually liked it a lot. A friend tried the albacore in a salad, looked pretty good so I might have to try it for myself another time. 

Their onion rings are a must, very crispy, not burnt, and very delicious. The condiments bar with its various pepper are good. I like that I can stuff my burgers with as much jalapeños as I want to. Their shakes aren't fancy but not that bad I'd order them again.

This location gets pretty busy during lunch and the drive thru is weird cause it goes around the bank next door you might miss the entrance.

To be honest I've previously gone to another Habit Burger location, tried their double charburger combo, and kind of wrote them off cause it wasn't that great, little plain. Glad that I ending up attending the Yelp event held here cause it was a good chance to try Habit again and more of the menu and lets just say I've been a number of times since.

Good place I'd go back. Probably wont order the regular charburgers again unless I'm dumping a lot of jalapeños on it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and consider it somewhere between an In and Out and a SMASH. It is a good burger and uses quality ingredients, but the flavor just doesn't make me really crave one."}
{"text":"Please please please give the steak sandwich with blue cheese a try. Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of \"In 'n Out\" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than \"SmashBurger\", slightly more than \"In 'n Out\"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friend of mine who use to work at a near by dealership recommended this place to me, since I live down the street. I have been here several times and am just getting around to leaving a review. Every time I go in, I get great service. The food does not disappoint. It is my go to spot if I don't know what to eat and am craving a burger."}
{"text":"The food was very good ( we ordered a chicken club sandwich, a #2 combo, and a grilled cheese kids meal), it was affordable, the restaurant was clean and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I have been a fan since I discovered Habit Burger, until about a month ago. I got a burger that just didn't seem up to the usual quality, there were full chunks of lettuce instead of the usual finely cut and the burger was very sloppy and just tasted different then what I have always gotten. Last Friday, I decided to give it another try and chose a salad. I got back to my office and started to eat it but was surprised when I tried to take a bite of the chicken and it was very tough and rubbery. Upon closer look, I found the chicken under cooked and very pink in the middle. I immediately tried to call and the recording said to visit the web site to contact, which I did. After receiving no response for a couple of days, I again sent another message through the web site. I have yet to hear anything back after a week. Knowing that customer issues are not addressed has changed my view of Habit, which was always very highly spoken of, now it's just disappointing."}
{"text":"I ordered the Original Charburger combo. The burger comes topped with lettuce, tomatoes, carmelized onions, pickles, and mayo. My burger was seasoned well and the fries were cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and soft inside. I substituted my drink for a chocolate shake which was delish. It was thick, creamy, and had loads of chocolate flavor."}
{"text":"I just completed a phone order and I must brag that customer service was AMAZING!!!

I don't even have my order yet but I am willing to leave a 5 star review for service. 

 I'm excited because the service was great. Sometime that just seals the deal!

She verified that I was calling the correct location. Confirmed the company policy before I ordered. Everyone hates surprises. She even provided the amount and exact pick up time!
Plus she stated my order with all the special request just as I did. 

 Daria is awesome!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"How anyone can include Habit hamburgers in the same discussion with Five Guys and In-N-Out is crazy. 

We had dinner last night at the Habit on blue Diamond and it was completely unremarkable and flavorless. After asking several people the girl who took our order found out that the burgers are 3.2 ounces. They are charbroiled but it really doesn't have a strong flavor and they didn't even seam seasoned.

Not a habit I would recommend."}
{"text":"This store is awesome! Came in for lunch with my husband and we noticed both managers were on the grill helping out during lunch hour, that's so awesome! Everyone is so friendly and the store was so clean, and to top it off the food was so delicious. Definitely recommending these guys to everyone looking for a great burger :)"}
{"text":"No doubt the BEST burger around, everything made fresh.  Excellent tempura green beans make a healthy side."}
{"text":"Voted the Best burger in Phoenix,  and for good reason.  Try one for yourself to prove it to yourself. Onion rings are great,  as are the fries. Great cone and malts and shakes."}
{"text":"I visited for lunch with my co-worker and daughter, I had a grilled chicken on the wheat bun.  My lunch companions both said ooooh,  when they saw my lunch.   It was broiled and was quite yummy, I just wish  they had something else besides French fries or some other fried food!  But I did enjoy that chicken sandwich!  Good job!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good burger place that was not on the strip. So of course I used the YELP app, again!  I have seen this place before but never had stopped in. So I decided to stop in for a burger and my son loves shakes this was a great place to dine in and the waitress was great the atmosphere was wonderful prices were good and the food was wonderful can't wait to get one near North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"If you like in and out, then a must spot because the habit l Burgers are twice as good. You can taste quality charbroiled burger and excellent hot fries! Also have salads."}
{"text":"We ate here recently and the burgers were very tasty.  I enjoyed the thick lettuce wrap (instead of a bun) and the green beans were a nice change from the standard fries.  Will come back."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food at The Habit!  I have been eating at the Habit for years, mainly in California, but was really happy to find them in Arizona.  I find what ever I order is consistently tasty, and delicious!  My favorite is the pastrami sandwich. Only sad thing is, for some reason that isn't on the menu in Arizona.  go figure!  All that aside, I love the steak salad, the tri tip sandwich, the burgers, and the chicken sandwich.  

None of the food is diet friendly, but it sure is good!  This is cooked to order, made the way YOU want it. Feel free to make changes.  Their iced tea is really good too.

It is not cheap food, but it is good food.  Don't miss this place! It will become your new Habit!"}
{"text":"It's the Habit Burger spot. Not thAt busy Good food. I got the Santa Barbara love avocado but overall good and if and when I need a change in burger joints I'll be going to Habit."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers good priced!! Fast and delicious


Wasn't a fan of the sweet potato fries tho. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place has opened recently to the valley, and I had heard that the food here was good. When I bit into the cheeseburger, that statement was confirmed. The burgers are wonderful. Not too chewy, the tomatoes and pickles in the burger were fresh, and the fries I ate were extra crispy, the way I like it. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to eat good quality fast food."}
{"text":"The Habit has great shakes. They're perfect after you finish your double char burger. Being from CA, I was stoked to see The Habit in AZ, even though for some unexplainable reason, it's just better in CA."}
{"text":"Overall, it's a pretty good place to get a burger. The burger was really good and juicy. The fries were nothing special at all. They had no flavor and were a soggy mess. The onion rings were good but not great. They had a nice crunch to them but lacked in flavor. I dipped them in ranch which made them way better. Their ranch was really good and helped add flavor to the bland food. I didn't get many onion rings for the price I paid."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to this location. Wanted to make sure nothing changed before I wrote a review.  I had the double Char burger and the boss has a single combo. The thing I like best is the charcoal broiled flavor and the patty size. Next comes the grilled buns, then the prices. Only thing I thought could use improvement was the taste of the fries. Find out how McDonald's does it. What else do you want from me? Forgot to try the deep fried beans, maybe next time and there will be a next time. Puts In & Out in 2nd place."}
{"text":"Got the urge for an exceptional burger, and thought I would be brave and try something different. Mistake. Stick with what you know like the old standbys, Red Robin or Carl's Jr. Instead, I visited the Habit Burger Grill based on the many glowing reviews. Bad idea. 

The Habit featured loud Tinfoil and trip hop tracks blasting on strategically-placed speakers that prevented any escape regardless of your seating. Immediate turnoff. It seemed like an obvious attempt to pander to a younger crowd, a sure signal of a lame attempt to cover up mediocre cuisine. In this case, that's exactly what it was.

Older, well-traveled burger connoisseurs like ourselves are not fooled. I remember the days of mom and pop char joints in  southern California that will never be equaled in my opinion. Indeed, the fare was unimpressive, tasteless, and nothing special. The \"Meh, I've had better\" category expresses our reaction perfectly. The onion rings were grocery store frozen and way too salty, not fresh at all. I had the mushroom double char, and unlike similar fare from Carl's Jr. could not taste the mushrooms in the burger (they were there). 

Next time, I'll stick with the tried and true for something as standard as char-broiled burgers. Better than In N Out? Don't think so. Pass."}
{"text":"Heard about the Habit and tried it Saturday.  What a burger.  Great flavor and excellent service."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and it was amazing! Got the charburger fries and a coke and it was better than In N Out!"}
{"text":"My go to burger spot. Highly recommend the Santa Barbara with onion rings and the deliciously thick and flavorful strawberry malt shake."}
{"text":"Fast food done right.

I recently got a chance to try The Habit at a sneak peek with free food. So far, I've tried two burgers: the Portabella and the BBQ Bacon. 

Both have been incredible. The portabella mushrooms were creamy and the meat tasted good. The bottom bun was a little stiff, but thats okay. The bacon was high quality, and the veggies were crisp. There's even a chile bar to add a spice of your choice!

The Habit also shines with its sides. The normal fries are crispy and creamy, while the sweet potato have great flavor. The onion rings were flavorful but a little overcooked.

A great burger with very few flaws."}
{"text":"I recant my horrible review because their GM promptly reached out to me, listened, and more than reasonably offered to make it right. It's all about the serve, and moving forward. Thanks for caring"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Habit.  The food is well priced and delicious every time, the salads are awesome too, what is not to love!!!  Everyone I have introduced to this place loves it too....great concept, great food, fast service, what is not to love....I always make a Habit of going to Habit!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best in town for such a cheap price. I had the double char with cheese and hatch chilis, the mushroom char, sweet potatoe fries, tempura green bean fries, and a chocolate malt. Everything was awesome. There's also jalapeños peppercinis and chili peppers on hand, as well as hot sauce and steak sauces available. It was surprising how fast we got our food seeing as they were busy when we came. Definitely making return trips to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"I got this delivered through an app and was so happy I did. The hamburgers were delicious and I loved the sweet potato fries with ranch. I never eat my fries with ranch but it was so good. My dad loved the food too so I think it's safe to assume we will be eating here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and every time I have liked their burgers and fries. I wish they had a little bit bigger of menu, but it is simple and to the point."}
{"text":"All 3 entrees that we ordered were amazing and fresh including the fries. Love all the iced tea options too. Extremely kind staff. Clean overall! Will be back!"}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly and you can get burgers anyway you can imagine. There isn't much more you could ask for in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of different The Habit restaurants but this was the worst experience. First our fries were burnt and our onion rings were cold. I asked to get the fries replaced, which took a while. Once I got back tommy table I see that my chicken club was missing the bacon and after asking them to get bacon I get two little shriveled piece of bacon on the side to put into my sandwich. These guys can't get anything right here. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!

UPDATE: So there's no way of me replying to the comment below by whomever works at The Habit so if you want to remedy whatever happened you can private message me directly. Thank."}
{"text":"Man why is thia place 4 star?  Food was great!!  Place is clean!!  I ordered the char burgers,  fried green beans was cool!!  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Came to habit burger with four separate difficult different orders, and I have to say AUSTIN was such a great help! His upbeat personality made the whole experience fun, and funny! He continued to help us make sure all our orders were correct, and even offered to help us carry out all our bags! And put all our drinks in our cup holder for us! Made sure we had all our condiments , and peppers and all that good stuff ! I've never had someone be that welcoming before ! He completely made mine and my mums day! He made conversation while making sure we were all good! It is so good to see that there are still good warm people like him ! 
AUSTIN we promised to come back && we will all because of him !!!! Thank you Austin !"}
{"text":"This place is good, but not great.  I liked the outside patio and the burger was tasty, but they messed up our order and we had to wait a while before they got it right.  The burger was tasty and seasoned well but the fries and onion rings were mediocre.  I am glad we stopped in to try it, but I won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Awe! The Habit Burger made it to the Westside! Welcome! If I want a burger I go here! I'm not much of a meat burger gal, so the Albacore burger was so delish!! I had it on whole wheat bun and it was very very yum! Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Omgosh! I've never had a better burger! Reasonably priced, gigantic and delicious! They don't cheap out on the avocado either!"}
{"text":"I just left there trying to get an early lunch. I walked out. Their system is down and can only take plastic. Can you believe that? I've been to many stores or restaurants that have computer issues and they stop taking plastic. But here they REFUSED to take CASH. And they are running cards with the old unsecured carbon paper imprint. Which means Discover can't be used because they don't have raised numbers. Someone there needs a reality check. If you can't accept cash then lock your doors until the problem is resolved."}
{"text":"Been eating here on and off. Last night I was in a fish mood. Not you mothers fish sandwich. Sounded weird and looked even weirder grilled tuna on bun. Not the most appetizing thing. I got some jalapenos just in case.  Jalapenos will make anything taste good. Didn't need them the weird sounding and weird looking sandwich tasted great. The girl working the front was helpful as my wife had some eating issues she went to research what is all on their chicken salad she thought it was romaine and iceberg then came and told my wife it was just romaine which she loves. And get this the chicken is not seasoned UNTIL it is ordered most places pre season chicken breast by the case. She said the company is very concerned about food allergies. My wife knows what she will order next time we go. Will order the tuna sandwich again."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here. What a treat. The characters burger was cooked to perfection. My wife's grilled chicken sandwich was also on point (she's very picky about her meal, especially in a new venue....thanks for not disappointing).  Yet another great option in an ever expanding cuisine map."}
{"text":"Burgers are kinda greasy and buns are too small , but the service was good and quick."}
{"text":"All of it is yummy: portabella char burger, ahi burger, chicken caesar salad, and any of their specialty salads. The onion rings alone are worth the trip. Try the tempura green beans. If you're having a total cheat night, go for the chocolate shake. All freshly made with quality ingredients and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"While I've never been inside The Habit, I've been through the drive thru several times.  It tends to take longer than most places, but then cooking meat takes time, and the burger patties are thicker than In and Out and other burger joints.  Tonight I had the terriyaki burger, which was quite good.  The onion rings and ranch here are fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! We were expecting a fast food joint but we were pleasantly surprised. Excellent service and the place was clean. Everyone was extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"The best veggie burgers for fast food hands down!!! I had never had cucumbers on my veggie burger until Habbit Burger and now I would never want it any other way! So, if you want meat, fish, or veggie burgers this is definitely the spot to try! With your order you can add fries, onion rings, milk shakes, or a ice cream cone but, my must have is their homemade lemonade. Habbit lemonade is cucumber lemonade with strawberry I believe and it tastes delicious because, unlike most lemonade that's very sweet...this one thankfully, is not! I also can't praise the staff enough for always being so helpful and doing everything with a smile. In my book that's also what contributes to a very successful business!!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence here...my first few visits were good. Then I have had 2 bad experiences in a row.  My teriyaki burger had no sauce on it and no mayo. It was to go so I couldn't easily get it fixed. Then next time my salad to go had no dressing on it.

When this place does it right, it is really good food at a reasonable price. I will update my review based on upcoming visits. I'd really like to give it a better rating than 2 stars."}
{"text":"These are GREAT Burgers, Real meat and they have different spicals every week.  I love the freash sweet potatoe frys."}
{"text":"This is a good, easy going burger place, very friendly, good food..... a good alternative to just go and relax, and eat yummy burgers with out the high price."}
{"text":"Finally a good place to eat on Blue Diamond!!! I really enjoy their burgers because it tastes fresh and full of  flavor. I recommend the teriyaki burger and bbq bacon burger. In and out got nothing on this place."}
{"text":"This place really deserves 2 1/2 stars.  Really not as good as it used to be.  Golden chicken sandwich dry and way over cooked- fries just okay. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. I was disappointed since I heard it was  really spicy and it was not spicy at all. The burgers are overpriced and the service was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Positive experience!!  Things were all around great.  My husband and I like to dine in or carryout/drive through.  Ms. Jazzmine in particular gave us fast, friendly service with a smile.  The order was ready quickly.  She checked on us afterwards and cleared the table, too.  The store is very clean.  Thank you to the entire wait staff, especially Jazzmine.  If you want a positive dining experience, come see for yourself.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever eaten at a fast food restaurants where the manager came out to our table outside and made sure everything was good and recommended future meals and offered drink refills. Melanie was truly on point today! We really enjoyed our first time dining here and we will definitely be back! PS.the salads are really good here!!!!'"}
{"text":"Love this upscale burger drive thru. Good quality food and fast service. We had the Chicken club and the BBQ Bacon Charburger. Huge burgers and lots of fries. Not cheap but a step up from other fast food places. Bring your appetite and wallet."}
{"text":"I love this place because it is superclean the food is amazing the service is incredible and it is always great. 
There is plenty of parking and everything is really fresh.
There are a lot of restaurants in this area but the habit hamburger restaurant is the best by far."}
{"text":"I used to be a HUGE In N Out freak...until I moved to Phoenix & now live by one.  I'm just kind of over it now.  We read an article talking about The Habit being similar to the other place but better.  The place itself is kind of small, not great for a big group & it can get very busy with no where to sit during peak times.  The workers are so helpful & actually seem happy to be working which is hard to find.  Prices were great! I LOVED that you could get an order of  1/2 fries &  1/2 onion rings.  The burgers are so fresh & flavorful & the fries/rings have always been hot & crispy.  I wish this was closer to us as I would definitely be frequenting The Habit MUCH more."}
{"text":"My parants and I just went. It was packed and loud and there was a line out the door. The line moved fast and we spent most of the time looking for a free seat. We were lucky enough to get one and then we got our food. We all got charburgers and we asked three times for my mom's burger not to have onions and when it showed up we had to go back and ask for one without onions. The bun was nicely grilled and the onions were ok, but the tomatoes were under ripe, the pickles were cafeteria tasting, and I swear they got their burger meat from McDonalds. The fries were pretty good, though.

They renovated the place just before they moved in (the last place there had a bug infestation) and I think they didn't really think much about people attempting to move around inside. The spaces between tables are fine for one person but trying to get around the ever-present staff and all of the people getting to and from is almost impossible."}
{"text":"Char burgers are now one of my fav burgers to eat thanks to the habit! So delicious! From now on the habit is my go to place whenever I want to go out to eat. I would recommend this to place to whoever asks me for great burger places. I could eat the food they have here daily because it is just way too devouring"}
{"text":"Super good! I got the burger combo and I highly recommend dipping the French fries in boom sauce! Service was quick and friendly. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Their catchphrase is \"It's not the same without the flame. \" It should be \"It tastes the same with or without the flame. \"

It's disappointing. Is it cooked with a flame? I couldn't tell by flavor. It's no different than In N Out. I feel like I wasted my money. I have 3 stars though, for great fries and a Strawberry Limeade with cucumber slices beverage option. I wouldn't cone back though."}
{"text":"Have loved The Habit since discovering them in CA many years ago. Exciting to have them here in AZ. The burgers and onion rings are great. Kids menu has nice choices. Service is typically decent, though room for improvement. Main thing that needs some attention is the general cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing. 

Customer service was top notch. Very friendly and everyone had a smile. 

I had the number #2 loaded up. It was a great burger. Not all greasy and you can taste the char. Came with drinks and French fries. The ice tea was delicious and the fries were perfect. Very Tasty. 

Wife had #1 and replaced the bread buns with lettuce. She said it was excellent. Came with same fries and drink. 

Kids both had kids meals and ate it all. Not a complaint. Which from two very picky kids is an accomplishment.  

Also tried the chocolate shakes and were not disappointed. 

Didn't try the restrooms but I am sure they were like the rest of the place and very clean. 

We will return."}
{"text":"I've been on my Burger Crusade for years looking for the best burger.  This burger place is well done.  Burgers made to order and tasty fries and more.  We stopped in about 1:30 PM thinking the place would be empty enough to not have to wait.  We didn't, but the place was still 31/2 full at that later hour.

Well thought out and very friendly and warm people behind the grill.  Worth the stop."}
{"text":"We've been to the Habit in California and were happy to see this one in Phoenix. The burgers are great with fresh ingredients. The fries are delicious too. We went on a Sunday for lunch. It was not too busy. Parking was easy and convenient."}
{"text":"We order the original Char burger with avocado and a teriyaki burger,the burgers where amazing. The fries could of been better if they where a little more season."}
{"text":"I had a tri tip steak sandwich ($7). It tasted good but the meat was super chewy and it was very difficult to eat without making a huge mess. I've been told that they don't carry it at all of their locations. So maybe there's a reason for that. Maybe I picked the worst item on the menu. Then again, that's no excuse, all their items should be good in order to get a good review. Also the parking was garbage. It took literally 15 minutes of going in circles waiting for someone to leave to find a spot. All the other parking in the area is reserved for other businesses and residents in the bordering neighborhood. There are plenty of good places to go for lunch in the same area. Save your time and save your money for a non-chain, non-mediocre restaurant. Go to Two Hippies burger joint."}
{"text":"Nice new burger joint on my side of town, was Leary to try it out do to having a bad experience at one in Vegas. Much to my surprise this place was on the level and I was quite pleased with it.  They were crowded but the line moved along quickly, customer service was really good and the prices were nice. Opted for the santa barbra which was quite satisfying to my stomach and wallet. Will gladly stop by again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My all time favorite place to grab a burger and some onion rings! Not only is the food here delicious, the value is also amazing. You get red-robin quality burgers for much less. Don't even go to McDonald or jack in the box, just go here because the quality is in a different league and it doesn't cost that much more. My all time favorite burger place!"}
{"text":"There are better burgers out there,  but when you consider quality,  price,  and convenience nothing beats The Habit. Everything is made fresh to order, and the grilled burgers are superb. I love the teriyaki char and the single with bacon. The onion rings and ranch dressing are a current favorite. And this summer they have had strawberry lemonade!  Try it,  you'll love it."}
{"text":"Love the food and customer service. My toddler dropped her hamburger and they grilled another one up immediately. Great place! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Modern little place with a cool vibe.  Young, enthusiastic workers take your order at the counter   You can watch the guys work the grill.  There are lots of burger, chicken, salad choices. There's a dining bar with stools and there are booths.  I had the delicious Charburger and onion rings; my dining companion had the Charburger and sweet potato fries.  We had this to go...and our order came up quickly just before the lunch rush.  No drive-thru available."}
{"text":"New location! Busy during the afternoon hours but worth the wait for delicious food! I ordered the Santa Barbara Charburger with Swiss cheese and all of the fixings, plus avocado. I also had French fries and onion rings. My beverage of choice was iced citrus green tea! Lastly, I ordered sundaes: vanilla and strawberry! These sundaes aren't the McDonald's type. One is enough to share between two if you must. Yummy food made to order! Customer service was also A+ during my visit."}
{"text":"Visted this place for the first time in Sept. 2017. Ordered a Veggie burger and fries! Although, I didn't finish it, what I had was good enough. However, for my next trip, I'll go for the signature charburger and I'm sure I'll be more satisfied. Overall, the ambience is quiet for the most part (busy, outside surroundings), the area is quaint, and the customer service is kind."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!!

Seriously, I have been searching many places to find my favorite burger joint and this place has exceeded expectations!

I have had a few of their options but the Santa Barbara style is by far my favorite. I always leave way too stuffed and even more satisfied. 

All the staff members are friendly and do a good job at keeping the tables and restaurants clean. 

Having been to a large handful of competitors in the Tempe area, I feel confident saying these are some of the (consistently) best burgers in town. 
 
In-n-out has been a long time favorite until I tasted the superior quality of Habit burger. It is a little more expensive than cheaper burger places- but you can definitely taste the quality!"}
{"text":"Very good food cooked to order. The wait staff are very nice and professional, they take pride in their service to customers.

If you are really hungry, try the Santa Barbara burger it is to die for!"}
{"text":"Very yummy burgers! The chicken sandwich looks amazing and the strawberry limeade it so good!"}
{"text":"Thursday afternoon for lunch for 5. Was very surprised at how reasonable the prices were for semi gourmet burgers. I thought this place was going to be like a bobbys burger palace or shake shack with burgers ranging from 7-12$. 
The actual prices ranged more like from 4-7$. Much more affordable and can only be described as an upscale in and out with a larger patty. 
We ordered:
- 2 golden fried chicken: with and without cheese and bacon: recommended!! Deep fried with lettuce cheese and buttermilk. 
- teriyaki char with cheese and side order of sweet potato fries and a drink- def recommend!!! Juicy grilled pineapple ( and I don't even like pineapple on the burgers or pizza but this one helped with the dryness of the burger) lots of mayonnaise and buttermilk sauce, lettuce tomato. It was super delicious and for about 5$ (just for the burger) it was a steal! 
-Char burger 
- double char burger 
* what I did notice was that they didn't ask us how we wanted our burgers cooked. I believe everyone was cooked to medium for health sanitations and made the burger just a little dry
 Tips: ask for extra buttermilk ranch- super delicous
- get the sweet potato fries instead of the regular fries!! Really soft on the inside with super crispy on the inside- medium cut 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint, especially love the tempura string beans. Aside from the Ramsey burger, I'd say this is my second choice. It's very nice and clean, fairly fast. I'd definitely come back, it's so close to my place"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a handful of times and I have thoroughly enjoyed each visit. 

Although The Habit is known for their Charburgers, I always get the Chicken Club sandwich and I am never disappointed. The chicken breast is moist and grilled to perfection. You can't go wrong with a sandwich that includes crispy bacon and avocado, am I right? The produce is so fresh! The portions at The Habit are big and extremely filling. 

I love the fact that they offer a variety of sides. Everyone is bound to find a favorite! My personal fav is the sweet potato fries. They're the perfect combination of sweet and savory! Lightly salted and delicious. They also offer original French fries, o-rings, tempura green beans and more. So. Many. Options.

This location is fairly new and really clean, which I appreciate. The interior decorations definitely give me that Southern California vibe if that makes sense. Paintings of surfers and the ocean on the walls... I love it! Prices are reasonable and the service is great! The staff is friendly and always willing to answer any questions you may have about the menu. It's easy to tell that The Habit focuses on quality!

I'm looking forward to my next visit! Maybe I'll step out of my comfort zone and try a Charburger and some of those tempura green beans!"}
{"text":"Apparently this chain has been around since the 60's, an era of free spirits, VW Buses, Sandy beaches and big wave riding.  The concept and food remind me of another West Coast burger chain which has gained great sucess on stagnat simplicity and robotic execution.

Habit Burger grill may have evolved with the changing times adding Veggie burgers, teriyaki burgers,and kids chicken items.  The decor has a very modern and clean design for this vegas location.  I went with the signature Double Char combo. The burger came out fast a topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and grilled onion.  The burger was a filling portion with 2 1/4 lb patties stacked and flame grilled for flavor. 

My favorite part of the meal was the thick cut fries. Great portion and once again very filling.  The we're fried golden brown and had a nice crunch and seasoned well. It seams the decades of this concept being around they have perfected some items in there kitchen.  

Overall good experience so much so that I could make this place a Habit.  The staff and managers were all very friendly.  The one issue I had was the size of the place. Capacity said 70+ but we were there with about 30+ and it was feeling cramped.  Good thing they have an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I won't hurry back.  I did enjoy the amount of avocado they put on my veggie burger.  The sweet potato fries were okay.  The line was a bit long and the food a bit over priced."}
{"text":"I think it was okay meat wasn't cooked all the way , patties are a lil thin, fries were okay... sweet potatoe fries were pretty good my over all experience was like a 6 ... the sundae was good"}
{"text":"Burger was almost as good as in n out.. 2 stars because it smells like fish..staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwiches and sweet potato fries. The prices are reasonable the the service is quick. Went around 2 for a late lunch and it was pretty crowded. Would definitely go back, the outdoor seating had misters which is a must in the Zona heat."}
{"text":"Better than you average fast food hamburger chain but prices are a little high for the milk shakes"}
{"text":"Solid burger. Prices are reasonable and kid friendly. My only complaint is that they put mayo on the burger.  This isn't Canada people. I order it without mayo and add grilled onions. The fries are very good also."}
{"text":"Great burger plus other options such as chicken and tri tip steak sandwich also salad options as well. Great shakes and malts too! Burgers are juicy and flavorful.  My husband's chicken club was juicy not dry and overcooked at all. I had the mocha flavored malt it was delicious!"}
{"text":"\"Mmmmm mmmm mmmm\" is what my honey and I said as we took our first bite into the burgers here! He got a habit char double cheeseburger and I got the teriyaki pineapple burger sans the bread and both were amazing.

My burger was full of juice, sweetness and savory all in one bite with fresh lettuce buns and ripe tomatoes. DELICIOUS! I've gone to other places and had their teriyaki burgers before but this one takes the cake. We big agreed that both our burgers had a savory char grilled taste to it- you know, the kind that reminds you of being in a backyard BBQ with your friends and family. 

We also got onion rings, fried green beans, and fries. The onion rings had a nice crispy taste to it and didn't taste like it was drenched in oil. It had a kinda sweet taste to the batter but I honestly think that's what made it taste so good. It almost tasted like it had panko on it to because of how loud the crunch was with each bite. I also loved the fried green beans too- you can tell the beans are fresh and full of crisp and the right amount of juiciness to it. There wasn't a huge amount of coating on the green beans but just enough to give you the bite from the batter and the freshness of the bean. 

All in all, we are going to come back here on our cheat day! The staff were nice, restaurant was clean and everything was accessible like the ketchups, jalapeños, chili and banana peppers."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Employees are worthless, managers are worthless. But in n out is close so that's a plus. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Not talking only about the burgers, but the staff. They pride in their job. No one just laying around. Everyone working hard to get you in and out (No pun intended). That's why it is a great spot for lunch, and I would most def be back."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and it was FANTASTIC. We brought our boys and we all really enjoyed it. The food and atmosphere was so good. The staff walks around and makes sure all is well and takes your tray. We will definitely be back. We also really like that the menu has a variety. A+"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here today. Jazmin was our cashier and she was great! She came by our table twice, once during and once after our meal. We even talked for like 5 minutes which is great! The burgers here are good, the fries are alright, and the onion rings are awesome. I'm definitely coming back here. (:"}
{"text":"Really good food and you can get creative with how you want your burger. Great facility, very clean and fast service. I still prefer In n Out but still a good place for a burger."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Called in an order, had to give them my CC info over the phone just to place the order so if you're paying cash don't even waste your time.  Was told it would be ready in 20 mins, got a call from a number in North LA, didn't answer, checked my vm which I normally don't so quickly, it was the habit burger processing dept saying that my payment went didn't go through, called them back and was told my card info did't go through and my order cancelled.  If I wanted to place the order again it would take another 20 mins.  I said out of frustration this is kinda silly why can't I just pay when I get there, it's not my fault the girl who took the order entered my card info incorrectly, the CS rep responded actually the card was declined not entered incorrectly.  I told her thanks for her help and went to 5th ave Cafe for a couple burgers.  And yes I used the card that was \"declined\"  to pay for them.  PS. parking is a madhouse and not worth the hassle at this location, but honestly end the end who wants to spend their hard earned money at a place where they treat you poorly."}
{"text":"Disappointing, ........ The location at McClintock and Guadalupe does not have it together and was a huge let down after I bragged about it and brought a group of friends. My onion rings were burnt and my cheese burger had no cheese. One of the guys took my burger back and slapped a piece of cheese on it and when I got it back the burger was cold and the cheese unmelted with a cold bun. Needless to say I did not eat it nor the burnt onion rings. Dealing with the burger was such a big ordeal that I didn't even mention the onion rings. This location is COMPLETELY different from my experience at the Phoenix location on 16th Street and was a true let down."}
{"text":"Normally their food is fresh and delicious. I got a \"Cobb\" salad today with BROWN avocado. So obviously I didn't eat that nor did I realize the lettuce would be shredded taco lettuce. Not happy with this location."}
{"text":"Walked in an the cashier whom I thought was the manager greeted us with. Super huge welcome I felt as if I was back in my home state of Texas because she was so amazing loved the food the taste of home styled food is always the best when I come visit Phoenix I def. will come eat here again not just because the food was great but because one woman's cheerfulness was amazing and that isn't very easy to come by ..."}
{"text":"Not a fan. At all. We were craving burgers but wanted something different. So I turned to yelp and decided to give it a try because the reviews were so good. I ordered the burger with cheese and bacon and tempura green beans. Hubby had the garlic portabella burger and fries. Get home and 1) my bacon burger had no bacon, 2)  portabella burger only had 2, 1/4 inch bits of portabella mushroom. The burger itself was underwhelming. Really bland and there was just something not right with it that I couldn't put my finger on. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, chicken sandwich & salads. Sometimes staff seems a bit overwhelmed, but food is always good. Can get a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Decent food, friendly service, reasonable wait time. Better than your typical burger joint, with some interesting toppings and sides."}
{"text":"Love coming here with the family, it remind me when I live in California. Great food!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and the employees there are wonderful. They served me raw chicken in my salad, once it was noticed, they apologized up and down and ratified the problem."}
{"text":"First timer and I will most definitely be back !! Customer service was impeccable  food came fast and was absolutely delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Never gotten anything from the Habit I did not enjoy. Highly recommend the lemonade!"}
{"text":"Went thru drive tru today. Food is normally good. Service can be slow but I can wait as food is good enough. This time though they totally botched my order. Tried to call but don't allow you to get through. Can't stand when I get home and order is totally opposite of what I asked."}
{"text":"Besides the food being amazing! The staff was extremely friendly. The cashier taking my order was very patient and very helpful in helping me decide what to order. Will definitely come back again and again as I am frequently here for work."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite burger places. Always has great burgers, great fries, and great service. The tables are messy occasionally but overall extremely satisfied with the many visits here"}
{"text":"First time here but had one of the locations bookmarked for a while. This place has a great feel to it, reminding me of Fudruckers back in 90s Miami. There is a drive thru but a 10 minute wait isn't appealing to me sitting in the car. It was super quick as we sat and waited though. The menu is straight forward and mimics Five Guys. $5 ish for burgers, $6 ish for sandwiches, $7 ish for salads....right! Fries and onion rings are on the side at about $3 or so. Drinks are separate also. There are no combo choices which is why I took away a star. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal but I don't think the $15 for a chicken sandwich, onion rings and drink was well priced. I would pay the same if it were a wait staff perhaps. I did like it though! My wife had the veggie burger. She stated the patty was just warmed up and not seasoned but we appreciated their vegetarian offering. I will go back but I would save a few bucks and get water and shared fries."}
{"text":"Great food. Hamburger with more meat than In and out and pink in the middle! Crispy fries and onion rings. My new favorite burger place. It's a habit!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. Has to be one of my favorite Burger places now! Very clean restaurant with excellent service.

The burgers are just as they should be, crisp bun, juicy patty, and light crisp toppings. Don't forget to add cheese and bacon!"}
{"text":"Good burger place. Clean and modern looking and the food was not too oily like you get at some places. My son loved the Chocolate Shake and my wife and I enjoyed the Charred burgers we ordered. 

Reason for the less 1 point is the ordering system. Placed order online for pickup while my wife was driving to their store from a quick shopping trip, but messed up the CVC code on the back of my card. Got a call at 4:10pm for an order to be picked up at 4:20pm originally place at 3:30pm.

Lady over the phone tells me my card was declined and if I wanted to correct the card. I of course said yes and gave her all my details again. At which she says \"Thanks just bring your card in with your ID\". I promptly said my wife is picking up I am just ordering because I am static and she is driving. 

Lady replied with well we will just cancel the order and you can place another one with your wife's details or when she gets here, and even with the original order it will be another 10 mins late. It was just a rude way to address a Client especially when it is a very common occurrence. Families order for other family members to pick up at least we do at many stores/shops.

What was more annoying was after I used a card that my wife had on hand for the order after a quick call to her and she went to pickup with her ID and Card present they DID NOT even check or request it. So the Staff member basically was being annoyingly difficult over the phone or their policies are not thoroughly followed.

To top that, my wife had to wait till 4:45pm an extra 15 mins past the new delayed time. So ordered at 3:30pm got served at 4:45pm.

Other than that, the food was good, and we will be visiting them sometime in the future but maybe this time give their actual sit-in dining a try and review accordingly, hopefully it's not only the food that's good but also the service.

I still recommend you \"reading this review\" check them out non-withstanding the food deserves it. 

Thanks for reading..."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the name of this restaurant is perfect.  I have developed a habit for Habit Burger.  The lines are out the door at lunch time.  I see why.  And I will wait in the line every single time!.
Habit Burger takes burger making very seriously and they are perfectly charred and the veggies are cold and they even have fresh grilled onions to add.  The fries and onion rings are amazing.  I cannot think of one bad thing.  Great service, happy employees, clean establishment and I am addicted!"}
{"text":"I'm from So. California  visiting the area, and this place has great service for reasonable prices. The cashiers are really polite, sweet, and professional. The burgers were a little small, but tasted really good. The fries were excellent,  way better than fries and in and out burger. I appreciated the large selection of iced tea since I dont drink soda. The jalapeno bar was appreciated as well, since most franchises do not have jalapenos available. 

The owner came to check up on us and ask how us the food was. This place is very clean, and I would eat here again if I were in the area!"}
{"text":"Soooo good!! I've been looking for a good GRILLED burger and I have found it. Super tasty and their fries are always perfect. Hubby has been here 4 times in the past week...WE ARE OFFICIALLY  HOOKED!"}
{"text":"Average food. My husband ordered the Santa Fe burger, which by description is a double burger. Yet his burger came with only one patty.  Four people had to \"confirm\" his burger had only one patty. SMH. He also ordered and paid for avocado on his burger, which consisted of a tiny sliver. We were charged for and received an extra order of fries that we didn't order/want. It was $2-3 but still annoying. It wasn't super busy yet the staff not doing anything just stood around, even with trash on the floor, in plain sight of customers, namely me. See photo from my seat. Was my first experience at this chain. Unlikely I'll return."}
{"text":"Took the kiddos here for a Spring Break Burger and shake. I was going to go with a salad, they looked great! Decided to splurge and ordered a Char Broiled Cheese Burger and Boy am I glad I did! Yum ME!!

Thick, char grilled patty loaded with grilled onions and the usual toppings. The kids size burger seemed to be the same size as the regular burger which my older boys gobbled down in mere seconds. 

The milk shake machine was broken which was a bummer but all in all a great lunch! Fast and friendly service to boot."}
{"text":"They have delicious food, great service and the restaurant is nice and clean better than the goleta location."}
{"text":"This place can seriously become a habit. Perfect name for the place. Great burgers. Good fries. Quick, friendly service. You won't leave hungry either--especially if you order a double (what, don't judge me).

I really love how fresh everything tastes here. It is set up like a fast food restaurant, but the quality and flavor blows away every other fast food option. Yes, even that place you can get in and out of pretty quickly or that other place owned by those five dudes. The prices are very reasonable too.

I'm a big fan of the Habit. Maybe my favorite burger in all of Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Today I had the grilled tuna ceaser salad very reasonably priced and good the other day I stoped in and had the grilled chicken sandwich also reasonably priced and tasty"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite, quick burger place. I used to frequent the Guadalupe and McClintock location most but I moved more towards Ahwatukee so I go here. My only gripe with this place is that it is consistently not as clean as the Guadalupe location. 

My favorite part about going to the Guadalupe location in the past was because an employee named Cheyenne (sp?) was always such an absolute sweetheart. You can imagine how I felt when she ended up moving to this location a little after!

The menu here varies not only in types of food, but prices as well. I always suggest people to just get the number one or two and to take note it is a suggestion by the company itself. -The price is literally the sum of the a la carte items included in the combo-. Some people are kind of put off by this, but it also favors substituting items. I usually get a regular char burger no cheese or mayo and a side salad. I'm not missing out on any savings, so I don't feel punished for eating healthier. 

If you just take things slow and simple here, you won't really be disappointed."}
{"text":"NO DISCOUNT FOR MEAL DEAL!
Food is about on par with Smashburger, 5-Guys, etc. Still not as good as In-N-Out.  Subtracted 1 star for misleading \"make it a meal\". All they do is add the original priced sandwich ($3.45) plus drink ($1.95) plus fries ($2) = $7.40 meal price...no discount for buying all three.  Also, -1 star for poorly trained employees (not employees fault, it's on management)."}
{"text":"Love love love! I've been in multiple times and everything is always amazing. Employees are respectful and nice. Management is done well! The girl with the medium length hair that's at the front a lot is always looking out! I recommend this location"}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday night for our first visit ever. It wasn't very busy so we got right to the front of the line. 

I ordered a chicken sandwich and my bf ordered a burger and onion rings. 

My sandwich was served in a bowl while his was served fast food style, half wrapped with the exposed side touching the side of the tray in the corner. It was a little off putting. I gave my sandwich a solid 4 stars for the price. However, his burger lacked flavor, he said we should have went to Carl's Jr for a better quality burger. The onion rings were good though, nice and crispy. 

It's unlikely we will be back."}
{"text":"This is one habbit I don't think I will be picking up. While it may not be a bad habbit I think there are better ones to be had.

Inside it looks like fast food a counter, menu above condiment station and tables, But here you get a pager Vs a call, and the prices are a bit higher. 

I had a albacore tuna sandwich, $5.75 a thin slab of tuna on a huge bun with tons of tartar sauce and lettuce.  It was not bad but I like fish and don't need to only taste the sauce. 

For a side I had the onion rings $1.95 they were not special at all with a breadcrumb type coating and thin onions inside. 

Overall I was unimpressed and the vlaue was not quiet there."}
{"text":"Food is very delicious! Was very surprised! Fries are amazing! Food came in a fast manner, I ordered a regular char burger and it hit the spot:)"}
{"text":"So excited to finally have this yummy place here! Ate there on Four Square day & am going back today. What a great staff & amazing food"}
{"text":"I originally tried \"the Habit\" in California and is one of my favorite burger spot! So stoked it made its way to Las Vegas. Great service and food is so delicious!! Fresh ingredients also."}
{"text":"I thought I liked this place till I had the grilled chicken with grilled onions. Now I love this place."}
{"text":"Cold fries, asked for the burger medium - it was well, well done.  The bun is dry and like burned toast.  Will never return!"}
{"text":"Burger was fantastic! Better than in & out, smash burger, in my opinion. Still give a slight edge to Five Guys and Skinny Fats. The fried green beans were nice & tasty especially after dipping in the complementary ranch dressing. Staff were all pleasant and genuinely nice. Will be back for the ahi tuna sandwich which looks insanely good!"}
{"text":"I still love In-N-Out more .. The burger here isn't bad, but not as good as in n out. Ate here second time and still think it's just a OK. The meat isn't as fresh, don't like sesame bun, mayo n ketchup is just too plain. 
The onion ring is wayyy too crispy, I like my fried food to be crispy but this is beyond crisp. 
Sweet potatoes fries is not good either and so are the regular French fries.  
It's more expensive then In n out!! 
The only nice thing is the chili bar they have here.."}
{"text":"Best in Phoenix, no doubt! Family friendly to the maximum and the food is incredible. A little pricey, but we are talking great service with friendly staff. Relaxing environment with amazing selection. Did not see a gluten free bun for that special request, but all in, excellent!"}
{"text":"So my fiancé said she got sick from here a year ago and never went back and today I went for the first time and ordered a char burger and fries and well 4 hours later I threw up and I could see the pickles tomatoes and chucks of the burger. Needless to say this location needs severe inspection and improvement!"}
{"text":"The burger lacks flavor. The meat does not taste charbroiled. I ordered onion rings and again lacked flavor. All I could taste is the oil. This is the first and last time I will come here. The place is clean and friendly staff. The food is not worth the price. I will rather go to In & Out."}
{"text":"Great burger, Fry's were excellent (lots of salt which I loved) & wonderful service. I liked the food was made fresh & the burger was great! I ordered the single cheese burger combo & finished every bite."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience eating here. My burger came out in a timely manor and was cooked fresh with a Santa Barbra feel to it. The staff was super friendly and their cucumber limeade is delicious. Highly recommended eating here If you're in the mood for a quick burger."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger I've ever had. For me, this beats In-And-Out and Five Guys hands down. What do I like about this place? Everything! The only drawback is that there is no drive thru but these burgers are worth going inside and waiting. Fresh, toasted buns, high quality well seasoned meat, and the grilled mushrooms are fantastic. They also offer items that other standard burger places don't have. Try the sweet potato fries and tempura green beans. Don't want a burger? They have chicken and other sandwiches too. But those juicy, meaty, burgers...mmmm....."}
{"text":"Really great burgers, sweet potato fries and strawberry shake. Kitchen was wicked clean too."}
{"text":"For the price, this burger is OK.    I will eat here before the other ones.   The place is nice and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price.  Good tasting burger, topped with fresh veggies and a side of crispy fries.  What can I say, hubby is a burger fan!  FYI, It gets pretty busy in there around noon."}
{"text":"Good food, no cause for complaints there. 
Decent customer service, didn't feel very welcoming. 
Not in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"I hate burgers and I love these dang burgers! Fries and burgers are awesome, but the milkshakes taste super artificial."}
{"text":"My husband and I order pick up from here regularly. It's our favorite burger spot close to home! Food is always ready on time no matter how busy it is inside and they start cooking the fries when we come to pick up. We don't mind waiting an extra 2 minutes because we go home with freshly cooked fries! We've never had an order incorrect, they go over your order before even passing you the food to make sure it's all correct, and service has always been good for us as well!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  Would've given this place a 4 star but the lady taking our drive thru order (Amelia) was rushing us and repeatedly got our order wrong when she read it back to us.  And then when we drive up to the window, she still had 2 items wrong.   They need someone with courtesy and patience to deal with customer service here.  Other than that everything else was good."}
{"text":"Quality crispy-charred burgers, sandwiches, what's not to liked A mini-bar of sauce or peppers for that extra kick right next to the drinks. I love it here."}
{"text":"Lupe overcharged us by getting our order wrong. Then when we ask for our money back, the supervisor wanted to give us a gift card. We wanted our money back & she rolled her eyes at us and started to speak in spanish. Then she said we were rude in english. Will I ever eat there again?  NO. This place shouldn't even get a star for customer service."}
{"text":"We order the double cheese. Lettuce wrapped because of the no carb thing. :/. They do it excellent here. Didn't fall apart until the last bite. Loved the flavor of the meat and seasoning they use. Pepper bar was an added bonus. Only thing I would've changed and why I will prolly still go to five guys more often is their choice of drinks.  Not very much for people that can't have sugar or caffeine. And all their toppings are an add on mostly for more money. And I love mushrooms. Oh well. Overall very tasty and will prolly be back."}
{"text":"Great service! Most burger joints just give you your good and send you on your way.  Not this place all the workers greeted you as us we came in. We were given a pager for the food.  Which doesn't take long to come out.  I got the Santa Barbara burger, which was huge and delicious! The fries were fresh out the as they should be! I had the strawberry lemonade which wasn't too sweet but it quenches your thirst.  I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"We stopped here late at night on our drive home from California. The burgers were good, but this location was filthy. The restaurant was not very busy, but well-staffed and still there was almost no place to sit because the tables all had trash at the them. We ordered our food and wiped off a table with paper towels. 

As we are eating, a manager came around to ask everyone how the food was, and the table next to us pointed out their own dirty table. He left and came back to wipe their table. Then instead of wiping down more, he waited for people to take start looking for a seat, pick a dirty table, and then come to the rescue? It was very bizarre. There were plenty of employees to wipe down tables so more people could sit down at a clean one. 

The bathroom was also very gross. I'd avoid this place purely based on cleanliness."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great burger that is not going to bankrupt you, this is the place. I have never had a bad burger here. This place is very clean and the food tastes fresh. There are some good options for healthy eaters such as lettuce \"bread\" and chicken sandwhiches. Cheap, fast, and tasty.... no complaints here."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. I even like the French fries. I have to take off at least half a star for disappointing onion rings.
Excellent service and clean dining area."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've had a Charburger from the Habit so I was excited when this one opened up. Their burgers are simple, but good. Like In-N-Out, they have carmelized onions for their burgers which I prefer over raw onions. I also like that you can have have half onion rings and half fries with your combo for those who, like me, want variety. They also have very good ranch. It's kind of thin and runny but perfect for dipping fries or onion rings in :) Also there is a condiment bar with 3 different kinds of peppers. Sometimes I like to add jalapenos or some of those flourescent yellow peppers (sorry don't know what these are called) to my burger for a little kick.

Service is extremely friendly here and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My new favorite burger spot on the area. The  burgers have that char-grilled taste, like an upgraded Burger King whopper. I love that they have a lettuce-wrap option so I can save a few calories. Their tempura green beans are another nice option other than traditional fries. Don't forget to add ranch! I l prefer this place to In-and-Out down the street, however its probably a third pricier."}
{"text":"Yummy char burgers, and they are gluten free with a lettuce wrap! This time I tried the BBQ chicken salad, and it was HUGE and delicious! Topped it off with their signature strawberry limeade, which is also incredible! The service is amazing and so is the food! They also have a drive thru at this location which is a BIG plus!"}
{"text":"They told me only can have it cooked medium well. What?  Since when.  Left without a burger and sad they are now overcooking apparently?"}
{"text":"The burger is okay because it is charbroiled but they could probably use a better quality meat.  The fries are good and the shakes are good.  The Tri-tip steak was meh.  It was impossible to actually eat it without pulling it right out of the bread.  Better stick to the burger and fries.  The tempura green beans only tasted good when I dunked them in ranch sauce.   The restaurant was clean and everyone was helpful and friendly.  Price is higher than In-n-Out. So there you have it."}
{"text":"The food is good however I've been 3 times and each time the order has been wrong. The service was extremely slow and employees were not helpful. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I walk in order two chicken salad with romaine lettuce, which I heard the person repeat and tell the person in the back making the salad.  She only made one with romaine.  I asked for extra ranch, because the ranch is watery.  The ranch does not even take to the lettuce, it just runs down.  I knew this was a problem so I tried to prevent all the problems that I had in the past, but this was the last draw.  I did not get romaine lettuce, I received iceberg.  The topper and my last draw was the black  in my salad.  Which matches the lady that prepared my salad.  I am not sure how the hair came through, but some of her hair still was seem underneath the cap.  I did not need any extra.  needless to say I am starving and I guess we should all check for hairs before we leave."}
{"text":"I was looking for a simple, quality burger for lunch. I was NOT DISAPPOINTED. first, the location is fantastic, the building is inviting and easy to find. Second, the service....1) I've never been here. And I told the cashier this. She immediately gave a brief summary of their food, followed by a suggestion, which I ordered. Fabulous service. 2) when my order was ready, the woman giving me my food, described my order in detail and directed me to condiments, napkins etc. attention to detail is fabulous.

The food!!!! I can't remember the last time I had such a delicious sandwich!!! The \"Santa Barbara\" is amazing. I cannot say enough about how impressed I was with this place. I have been to many high class restaurants, and paid much more money for food that was sub par and service that is beyond lackluster compared to this place. 

As a business man, I understand that when you do things right, nobody rights a review, or tells their friends. But when you do something wrong, the customer will tell everyone they know, and it will be all over social media. But to impress me to the point that I want to spread the word.... Enough said. Well done!"}
{"text":"When you walk in it feels sort of fast foodish. I got the grilled chicken with avocado and bacon. It was amazing and didn't taste anything like fast food. The place was very modern and clean. The service was very prompt. Will totally be back."}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelming experience. This is the second time I've been and only went back because it was close and for their strawberry limeade. Food is flavorless and unremarkable. Service is even worse.  At the drive through they just sit and stare at you when you say hello. I actually wondered if they spoke English as everyone working was Hispanic and the lady was stating at me as though she didn't understand what I said. 

The fries are decent but anyone comparing this to In n Out or 5 guys is on drugs."}
{"text":"Why would you go to BK, McDonald's, or any other fast food joint to get a burger ;when you can go to Habit and get a freshly made burger ( no microwave here) for pretty much the same price? I have been to the Tempe and  Chandler location and both are consistently great.  Theirs burgers and O-rings are the bomb!  So stop going to those fast food chains and getting microwaved burgers! Just go to Habit you will not be disappointed! BTW, not sure why people think this place 
is expensive? $7.20 for a double Char with fries and a drink. Not too bad in my book, unless you are used to the crap dollar menus at all those fast- food joints."}
{"text":"The fries here are amazing, for starters. My burger was delicious and much better than fast food. It's a clean, friendly environment, with great fast burgers. It's a great stop for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"1st time trying The Habit Burger Grill out. I received a mailer in the mail promoting a free sandwich. This week highlighted the grilled chicken whic is perfect because I don't eat red meat.

The Resturant is a cute modern style establishment. Hip music playing when you walk into the small dining area that includes outside patio service. The establishment is very clean and organized.

I came during lunch hour so it was busy. Limited parking and a long line that went fast. I decided to take my order to go. I have say I was not greeted when I walked in which could because the Resturant was slammed. There is a trendy virtual menu to look at while waiting in line. The cashier noticed my coupon and said \"there are many steps to this sandwich order.\" Then she asked me questions on what I did and did not want. It was confusing because I did not see these options on the virtual menu like Smashburger. I also felt rushed. See at Smashburger they always ask you if this is your first time dining at the Resturant. Then they welcome you or they thank you for returning. I added onion rings to my order and that was it. 

The wait time was not long. They give buzzers to their guest so you know when your food is prepared. I feel it takes that personal touch away. At Smashburger your assigned a number then your food is delivered to you. This is for dine in. Takeout they walk the food over to you. I checked my order to make sure my food was accurate. My sandwich was prepared wrong. I asked for no cheese and they put it on there by accident. My sandwhich was quickly remade as the grilled chicken is already prepared. They just pull it out of a silver heated container and reheat the meat. There was never an apology. I was just ignored and told to wait.

I got home to indulge and noticed I was not given any napkins or condiments. My food was nicely wrapped which helped it stay warm. My chicken sandwhich had a nice presentation garnished with lettuce and an orange slice. My sandwich bread was soaked in butter. I like the type of bread but way to much butter. The chicken and veggies were good. My onion rings were good as well. They were not salty or to greasy. I have to say it was not bad but I am all about customer service and a great experience. I may try them again but I am not in a hurry. Smashburger has sold me since the very first time I walked through there doors. I have been to three in the valley and have had the same great experience at each location. Which is why I now eat there at least 2-4 times a week."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for a quick Saturday lunch with the hubby. He can have his burger and I can have my grilled chicken Caesar salad. The prices are good and everything is always freshly made. They offer a variety of beverages from shakes, malts, sodas, flavored unsweetened teas and today they had two juices to choose from. I tried the peach ginger and it was very good. This is one of our regular lunch stops. The reason I gave it four stars as opposed to five is that tables are never wiped down and seats are always dirty as well. Staff comes around interrupting meal to try and take the tray my food is on, sorry, I don't like placing my food on the tables and at least the tray has a paper placemat covering it."}
{"text":"So bomb! Came in for a weekday lunch after having seen The Habit on a top 20 Phx burgers list, was so not disappointed! I got a double burger with bacon and cheddar, it was seriously amazing. The cheese is super melty and the burger is really tasty on its own. Definitely a lot of bacon on that bad boy. The fries were awesome as well! And the tempura green beans were aaaaamazing. 

The side Caesar salad was really great, it had a ton of Park and dressing, and the larger salads I saw other people getting looked really tempting too. I also went with a chocolate milkshake which was soooo good! 

Service was super quick and friendly and the atmosphere was nice. Very clean and pretty bright inside. 

Overall a great burger at a reasonable price! I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Grilled chicken and Santa Barbara burger is our favorite. Great atmosphere and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"Great juicy cheap burger and the onion rings are the nice thin/draw kind. Totally worth it and much better than McDonalds"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the Habit back in California. I lnow there is so much hype around In and Out but this place is way better. The food is always fresh and so good. I've never had a bad experience at any Habit which includes this one. The place is clean and the staff is polite. The chili pepper bar is clean and stocked.

The menu is small but don't let that distract you from the big flavor and serving size. I'm an eater and I get full off of their meals. Thr only complaint I have of this place is that it is way too far from my house. I guess that's a good thing because I'd be 50 lbs heavier."}
{"text":"The Habit Burger is fast becoming a regular weekly stop for me.  I truly enjoy the combo burger with Swiss cheese and mushrooms.    It is a great tasting burger through and through.  The fries are also spectacular.  I brought my six year old here last week and we tried the Caesar salad which was surprisingly good.  
I am truly amazed that they can have a typical hamburger, fries and fast food menu alongside chicken, tri-steak, salads and other options.  The selection is first rate and the prices are reasonable.

The wait staff are friendly and courteous and truly want to assure their customers are satisfied.

The reason I did not provide a five star rating is due to the size of the restaurant.  The inside is small and it can be a maze to make it to the fixin bar to get a refill.  The restaurant is normally at least three quarters filled and should be probably be expanded in some way.  The parking can be a challenge.  

Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"On my first visit the lovely girl behind the counter when asked what her recommendation was (I was thinking what type of Burger) she said \"The TriTip is wonderful.\" IT IS and on three subsequent trips it has been!

Specifically:

TriTip - Served on toast it is flavorful and terrific! Don't miss it. I know, it is a \"Burger Joint\" and I have had their burgers, they are nothing special but the TriTip is!

Tempura Green Beans - WONDERFUL! Light and crispy as you would expect

Sweet Potato Fries - a very good rendition, although could be a bit crispier

Service - very nice

Price - Excellent quality TriTip sandwich for $7+

I am a repeater for the TriTip alone, but the sides are just fine and very nice."}
{"text":"Not my style of burger, but others seemed to enjoy it.  Seems to be more on the dry side.  Very light mayonnaise spread and buns were toasted to the point it crumbled.  Cheese was melted....but cold and hardened.  Patty was luke warm.  I felt it sat for a while. Seasoning of fries was a little lackluster for me as well. It was very busy and a long wait, but keep in mind this location did just open.  I will not return, but do give it a try to develop your own opinion.  Maybe our burgers and fries were affected by the new opening.  Place was clean and friendly."}
{"text":"I saw the best thing... The fries was ready for pick up but the customer hadn't came to front to pick the order up. The cook put a napkin over the fries to keep anything from getting on the or to keep the little warm. I have never seen that before and love the idea.. Great job... Oh ya the food was great as well.."}
{"text":"Good burger, decent selection and fast service.  The chocolate shakes are really flavorful.  We ate here on a Friday evening around 5:30, and the location was not very crowded."}
{"text":"Burgers are kind of dry. I do like their milkshakes though. I like that you can request no salt on the fries which i need for my low salt diet."}
{"text":"We were driving back from Bass Pro and were going to stop by In & Out, but I had saw Habit Burger and Yelped them & it looked really good; I thought trying something new would be cool! Let me tell you, we were NOT disappointed at all!!!! The burger was soooo delicious & the fries are by far the best I've ever had! Will be back for sure:)"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to The Habit opening I heard it was delcious, I've never been. So I went today. Drive thru. Ordered the #1-char burger with a side of rings and a diet coke.

Customer Service-was awesome they were all nice and friendly. 

Burger- flavorless, bun was cold. Put tomato when I said not to.

Fries-cold. Tasted like they were sitting for awhile. 

Onion rings- crispy but cold. They were prob good when they were fresh.

Drink. Flat and warm. Hardly any ice.

Huge disappointment. I ended up throwing the food away. There were a lot of new places to eat built right next door. You guys really have to do better than this if you want to keep business."}
{"text":"Burger was good. Grilled chicken sandwich was good. Liked having French roll available instead of burger bun and honey mustard instead of mayo. Was surprised that the price was no more expensive than a combo at a fast food joint but much better dining experience. Would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"The Pros: Inexpensive menu, fresh food, great malts, clean restaurant, friendly smiling employees, pepper bar. 

Cons: Stale and not creative dining area, awkward layout in the dining room, seen before menu options, pre-made salad dressings.

Good for a quick burger. In my opinion there are other burger options in town that I prefer."}
{"text":"There are way too many burger places around here to go to this place. The hamburger meat was plain and the whole burger was too big and boring. The fries were plain and burnt we had to add a bunch of salt and pepper to even make them edible."}
{"text":"WOW! I get why this place is called \"The Habit\" it is delish. Best burger I've had in Phoenix in years. This will be our new burger spot. Great taste, tender meat and love the grilled onions. No picture since I couldn't wait to eat it after one look."}
{"text":"I just had the worst steak sandwich I've ever ate. I ordered it med/well and I got it med. Was drive thru order so didn't notice till we got home. Ate about half and felt sick, thru the rest away. My daughter ordered a burger tgat looked good and she enjoyed it.  I had ate at another Habit before and everything was ok, maybe since this place just opened up things need to get on track.. I don't know, but won't ever order a steak sandwich there again.  Wish I would have took pictures but I was just too disappointed."}
{"text":"A double with cheese and an order of onion rings is my guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"Excellent for service. Burgers were just burgers. Good, but expected spectacular!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Love that they have tuna, veggie burgers and salads. Whole family is happy."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Great fries. And they have some really good lemonade that makes you refill over and over and over again. Very clean place and located in a diverse area. Even during rush hour it doesn't get loud."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Habit Burger Grill before and decided to try this place on the recommendation of  co-worker. You can find it in the midst of \"Restaurant Row\" on the NE corner of Flamingo and Paradise. It's actually in a small mini mall with Panera Bread and Chipotle, just east of Fogo De Chao.

We each ordered the #2 combo, which consists of a Double Charburger (we added American cheese) with an order of fries and a regular drink ($8.60). 

(+) Very juicy, tasty, and satisfying burger! The burger is pretty big, so much so that it was tough to get full bites of it! The meat was cooked perfectly. Definitely enjoyed my first Charburger!
(+) Customer service is on point. We were greeted at the door right away by a friendly guy who was great at explaining things and answering some questions about the menu! Plus he was walking around later to pick up trays and ask how everyone was doing. Very impressed at the level of service for a casual burger place!
(+) They set out peppers and chiles if you wish to add those to your items. Not my thing, but great to see they have that option available for those who want it.

Other tidbits -

- They have Coke products for their fountain drinks. No Coke Zero, but Diet Coke is available.
- No eggs available for the burgers. Not necessarily bad, just a heads up.

Really enjoyed this place and I think I would put it in my top 3 casual burger spots in the city! I will certainly be back!

4 solid stars.

Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the easiest reviews I've ever written (or typed :P). 

After trying the Habit Burger Grill on Flamingo, on a co-workers recommendation,   I was instantly hooked. So when I heard that a second location was opening right around the corner from my house, I was beyond stoked!

Yesterday I was able to check out the new location for the first time and I was very impressed! You can find the Habit's new location right next to Teriyaki Madness, on the northeast corner of Decatur and Blue Diamond Road.

As expected, the charburgers were so juicy and tasty! The fries were delicious and given in a generous portion. This is in no way a surprise.

What really stood out for me here was the amazing service! Everyone I encountered here was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were all happy and satisfied!

It is almost dangerous that I have a location like this so close to my house! I see myself coming here repeatedly to enjoy those luscious, scrumptious burgers! ...and becoming a much larger mammal due to it! :P

oh well...I'll deal..

bottom line: This place is really, really good!

5 stars.

Woohoo! As good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on Friday.  I had the portobello burger.  The burger was so big I had to make an open-faced sandwich and eat the bun top by itself.  It was nice and had crispy edges.  For $5 you get a substantial burger.A meal costs about $7 with fries and a drink.  Great fries - crispy and tasty."}
{"text":"Food was good. Not a disappointment but I will probably never crave it again. I know of other, better places.

The atmosphere was clean and fun. The service was nice. The food was good (not great.) 

The menu was typical of a burger joint. Not very expansive. If you don't want a burger there are some other options but you are really going to the wrong place."}
{"text":"Food hasn't disappointed yet, but the service is definitely wishy washy. On one visit, the girl at the counter literally had to take our order like 3 or 4 times because her register first, wasn't assigned, then second there was no cash in her register. She kept calling back to the manager who was frantically making food and avoiding eye contact and would not walk over. Meanwhile, a handful of employees and another manager, this one a male laughed and horsed around in what I'm assuming is the back office or whatever. It was weird and off putting, but the food was good."}
{"text":"Drove out of my way to come here tonight (because they have bomb veggie burgers) only to find out they are out of FRIES. wtf?! What kind of burger place runs out of fries? Also, would have been nice if the girl at the register informed us of that right off the bat instead of letring us go into great detail ordering our burgers. So disappointed."}
{"text":"My Portabella Char burger looks like the picture and taste delicious! This is my second visit to this location and impressed both visits. The food is on point. Between the two visits I've had the pleasure to also taste the Santa Barbara, scrumptious made for a big appetite. The Tri-tip steak sandwich is a treat and onion rings are perfect. My boys enjoy the shakes. What can I say the food is made to order you can't go wrong with anything you decide. Not in the mood for a sandwich have a salad your way. I can not leave out the people here. The friendly cashier, the cooks and management all seem to be enjoying either what there doing or their company of each other. All around good vibe and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"An up-scale burger/sandwich fast-food restaurant. I had a very good salmon sandwich. Others opted from the traditional burgers that came with the standard fries that were crispy without an oily taste. A good alternative to the major burger chains."}
{"text":"I tried to order the albacore filet well done but was informed by the lady at the register that well done is not allowed. Period. Medium well was my only option so I tried it and it was very pink on the inside. Thumbs down to customer service."}
{"text":"Today's visit was our second time and we absolutely enjoyed our meal.

The double char bacon burger was cooked to perfection and the onion rings were awesome 

also had a mocha shake.. was good 

The restaurant has excellent seating and very clean.

This is a must go to if you want a good burger n rings ( fries are good - prefer the rings )"}
{"text":"First time we ate there it was very good. Second time, not good enough to recommend. The original burger was tasty, the onion rings were almost burnt, most of the fries were an inch long. We ordered chocolate and strawberry Malts, they were pretty, but had absolutely no flavor. We threw the Malts away. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the 4th time I've been here since it opened.  We loved it!! However, yesterday it was different and GROSS!! I ordered the BBQ bacon burger, onion rings, and a coffee malt. It was an online order, which is usually the way we order as this location is usually really busy. My burger I took two bites and had to throw it away, it was WAY over cooked and tasted like someone poured a whole can of pepper on it, really gross! My onion rings (which are usually super tasty and crunchy) were soggy and nasty! My coffee malt was even gross this time, it had clumps of powder all the way through it.  I was so disappointed and it was bad enough for me to not want to go back again."}
{"text":"The service is great, the food average. Have to say that the strawberry limeade is great, but otherwise, all very average.

Restaurant is spotless.

Drink and condimemt stations are both well maintained and organized."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is fresh and tastes so good! My order has been messed up here before but customer service is still always great."}
{"text":"first time visit. staff is very friendly. even came over to ask if i wanted a refill on my drink. that was a bit weird. only had that said to me at buffets or a fancy restaurant. but its not a bad thing, i liked it!. food was very good. ordered a number 2. took less then 10 to make at 11:30 lunch hr. i will visit again"}
{"text":"Yelpers didnt let me down! Came here to try the teriburger and I must admit it was fantastic. 
I recommend it authentic island style and get the raw onion with mayo. Was Ono!
I read in a review that the fries weren't very good but I disagree. they tasted fine to me.

The size of the meal was good for me; liked that we got pagers to know when our food was ready and I enjoyed the strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"Finally! A burger joint that lives up to expectations! I've been fairly critical of the new, hip burger restaurants that have been gaining notoriety over the last couple of years. Primarily because they undelivered in service. The Habit nailed it!

Don't get me wrong. There are lots of good burgers out there and I've acknowledged that. However, The Habit Burger Grill is one of the few that provides a unique burger, nice atmosphere and great service. (Pay attention Burger Theory!)

A number of people I know have all told me The Habit was their favorite burger joint. Based on those recommendations and the fact they opened a new location in Avondale, my hockey amigo and I decided to check out The Habit for dinner.

I like the fact that the menu is simple (think \"upscale In-N-Out\"). Hey! They are both burger chains based in California. They both focus primarily on burgers, but there is enough variety on the menu to keep you interested. There is a fried chicken sandwich, a tuna fillet sandwich and some amazing side options.

I chose the house specialty Double-Char burger with cheese and classic lettuce & tomato toppings. It's simple, cooked perfectly to order and really delicious. It's not the BEST burger I've ever had, but it's really close. My companion's burger had me feeling jealous. He made his a wrap (with lettuce and no bun). His was a single, but he added a grilled portobello mushroom and cheese. He absolutely loved it!

Now that I've made it to The Habit, I'm gonna make it a habit. Especially considering they have a drive-thru window. And amazing service! Thanks guys and gals!"}
{"text":"After some manly garage door work I stopped over at The Habit Burger Grill to check this place out. Seems like they have a great patio and decent indoor seating, but I can see indoor seating being a tough ticket during the lunch/dinner rush. I was there at 2pm on a Saturday and indoor seating was tough to get.

I had a burger and thought it was okay, nothing special. Although those onion rings that I didn't order looked awfully good. I see this place along the FLW Corridor as option #3 after Smash and In-n-out. Contrary to popular belief, the pricing at Smashburger is just as good or better than The Habit.

But it's always a good thing to have some competition in the area so I hope this place lives long and prospers."}
{"text":"Passed by here a few times. Decided to check it out. Had a Teriyaki Charburger. I was impressed. For the cost, this was a damn good burger. The fries and onion rings were good too. Tasty chocolate shake. Definitely will be having again."}
{"text":"Glad to see this location is back to exceeding my expectations! Great food on a busy Friday night, and even was able to make a last minute change to an order with no issues."}
{"text":"My first time here and probably my last. How do they ONLY have Swiss cheese available! I ordered a bacon bbq cheeseburger well done, the burger was good. The onion rings were salty as hell and the vanilla shake was very bland."}
{"text":"Great service,  very clean restaurant and the food was exceptional. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"New place for burgers I got to check out with some friends. We randomly decided to go after a berry trip. We saw a video about cheap burgers and expensive burgers. Habit is on the lower end of course. We came about an hour before closing an the place was empty. Everyone order something a little different and I decided to go with the Santa Barbara Style Char just a single stack. It's on sourdough bread instead of a bun and comes with avocado. The normal things that come on their burgers are lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, and pickles. I went without the pickles and onions. It was pretty cool but price was a little steep for a burger. $5-$8 is a little much. The fries were decent but nothing to rave about. They also have strawberry lemonade and vitamin water XXX which a lot of places don't have. A cool thing is the place has drive thru. I haven't used it yet but it always looks busy when I drive by during the day. It just didn't really impress me much. As crazy as it sounds I would rather go to in and out."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time...fantastic burgers and fries and service!  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Habit Burger Grill a great casual dining destination with burgers, fries, chicken & fish sandwiches and salads. Consistently great, no matter which location. Market Street just opened & doesn't disappointment."}
{"text":"Had the original Charburger w/cheese , fries & iced tea. It was very good. The food was hot and fresh and the service was excellent. I will be back to try the other offerings on the menu, especially the Tri Tip Grilled sandwich and the Tempura green beans."}
{"text":"These $10 a burger joints are popping up all over the place.  This one is much like the others, except for I found the burger piled high with fresh lettuce and tomatoes AND they offer more than just burgers.  Salads, chicken & filet of tuna sandwiches are on the menu.  Yes, they even have something for vegetarians.  I also loved the fact that they lightly toast the bun, it's the little things!

Their fries were good and their vanilla shake.....was awesome!  
Next time I'll try the chicken sandwich and the sweet potato fries.  There's my excuse to go back."}
{"text":"The staff at this location are very friendly.  I ordered the Santa Barbara and it was delicious.  The grilled onions, guacamole and sour dough bread compliment each other so well.  The fries came out fresh and were good.  If you're looking for a good meal with the same cost as other competing fast food spots, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint.  This place does so many things right, and only one thing is lacking. 

What they do right:
Excellent customer service -- it's clear that they aim to please; always polite and professional.  They usually jump at the opportunity to clear your tray/trash for you. The employees seem happy and the managers appear to run the place well.  
Good menu -- straightforward menu options, good pricing. 
Fast service -- only a few minute wait for your food
Efficient -- the pager/buzzer device almost seems too much for a burger place, but when you think about it, it helps save the annoyance of constantly hearing orders called out, or having to listen attentively for your own number.  
Great food -- the burger is good, the fries are good, the onion rings are good.  The quality of ingredients seems really good, and they make tasty food. 

What could be better:
Juiciness -- the burger patty is a bit dry, seems to be cooked just a hair under well done.  Maybe there is some way to make it more juicy?  I should try requesting a medium rare burger.  If not for the somewhat dry meat patty, this place would be a full 5 stars.  

Great place, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I like to save my 5 star reviews for something really special, really memorable, really out of this freaking world.  The Habit fits the bill...in every way possible. 
I came here on a Friday night (tonight to be truthful) Witt my mom and sister. Despite it being dinner time and Friday, it was surprisingly not too crowded. Even if it was super busy, it has plenty of seating - both booths and tables - so it's safe to say you'll find a seat regardless of how many people are there. 
The three of us got the #1 Charburger Original Combo. Cheeseburger, fries and a drink. Two of us got regular fries and one got sweet potato fries. The burger was outstanding. Really, really outstanding. And this is coming from me, a self proclaimed burger snob. It was cooked perfectly and the pattie was a substantial size, no \"where's the beef\" here, that's for sure. It was on a fresh bun and came with mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles and caramelized onions. Everything went so well together, the  ratio of meat and cheese to garnishes was on point. I swear I tasted everything on the burger in every single bite. The fries were great-fresh and hot, crispy on the outside with soft potato on the inside. The sweet potato fries were the same-really good and a nice break from traditional fries. The drink offerings are your typical fountain drinks but they do have 3 flavors of tea in addition to carbonated soda. There's also a cool serve yourself bar with banana peppers, jalapeños and regular peppers-a nice touch for sure. 
The staff there was very friendly and helpful. The young lady taking out order was great at answering the couple of questions that we had (this being our first time there) and she smartly recommended the sweet potato fries. Another employee came by our table to check on us and see if we needed anything-not service that you typically get at a fast food joint but certainly appreciated! 
With all the burger options in town, I find it hard to decide which is my favorite but this one is definitely in my top 5! 
I could see The Habit becoming a real habit for me!"}
{"text":"WOW what a beautiful restaurant and such  large menu, burgers salads sandwiches, tonight I tried tried the signature burger it was perfectly loaded with grilled onion, cheese pickles... 

They offer a sweet looking grilled tuna which I want to sink my teeth into next visit. Another thing I really like is they offer 3 flavors of Tea.  I will certainly be back 

Thank you Habit for coming to my neighborhood"}
{"text":"Love this place! The burgers are great and the Santa Barbara Cobb is always delicious. Our little family of 4 can eat there for about $25. It's in our neighborhood and the staff is always friendly. It's a pretty sweet deal!"}
{"text":"We had been to Blue Diamond location. We are just as pleased with this location. Super delicious !"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I had the Ahi tuna sandwich and it was delicious...My husband had a double burger and said that it was really good.  This was the first time that we have ever been to a Habit Burger Grill, but we will most certainly return!"}
{"text":"Can I give a lower review? Went for a school fundraiser and they wouldn't honor the credit to the school without the flyer.  Ridiculous in this day and digital age.  Won't ever patronize this chain again and will ensure all my friends know what a scam this is about how they patronize education."}
{"text":"Served nearly raw burger. Charred on the outside: raw on the inside. On-site manager did not resolve problem or seem to care. HORRIBLE QUALITY CONTROL.  Avoid!!"}
{"text":"Quality food for the price. The staff is lively and the atmosphere is attractive for family. Would recommend if you are a burger person! Santa Barbara burger was on point."}
{"text":"I was not even able to try their food. I tried to call in an order for pick up for my staff. When I called to place the order, the girl informed me that they would not be able to place the order because it was during the lunch rush and I would have to come in to place the order. Plus they were not taking orders over $65 at that time. I called it in early so they would have time to make the food. Personally, I don't know what the difference is, coming in and placing the order or calling it in. I call in food orders almost daily for work and our reps pick them up for us. I have never heard of such a thing."}
{"text":"Pulled in here after a long morning at the MRI center with my wife.  We did drive thru, the burger and fries were good and made just the way we liked them.  The burgers were juicy and the fries were crunchy, but not too salty.  The gal who took our order was very up beat, friendly and looked like she was having a good time at work."}
{"text":"Fun burger joint. They offer a lot of different toppings for your burger. They have pretty quick service. The burgers are fresh and taste really good.  The only thing is the front counter lady that took our order was a bit cranky, maybe she was just having an off day. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"went there the other day for the second time, we happened to have coupons for a free burger, I ended up getting the Albacore Tuna sandwich with the sweet potatoe fries. Both were very flavorful and the tarter sauce on the sandwich was awesome. My husband got the Charburger and was equally as tasty. Last visit I got the tri-tip sandwich and was just as pleased. I would HIGHLY recommend it!"}
{"text":"Habit has amazing food and the service was the best around for a burger joint.  Dylan the cashier was really friendly and made my families experience a very positive one.  I would highly recommend the Habit."}
{"text":"Today I had the golden chicken sandwich, really had no taste but never a complaint about the burgers here. Still recommend this place, just stick to the burgers and sides!"}
{"text":"Just picked up my salad from my online order which was the grilled chicken Cesar salad .... All the romaine is browning and old looking . Very disappointed for my second visit and coming off of my first visit where I sat in the drive thru for at least ten minutes . So needless to say I probably won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a burger. Good variety of ingredients, food served hot and within reasonable time. Delicious strawberry lemonade! Nicer inside than most \"gourmet\" burger joints."}
{"text":"This place has a drive through from hell. If you have 50 min to waste go for it. Takes forever for mediocre food and customer service"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! First location is Arizona, and the daughter wanted to try it. Never knew there was one close to us in SoCal? I had the BBQ bacon burger with fries. Daughter and Wife had the cheeseburger. Place reminds me a lot of In-n-Out, the food is different though! My burger was very good, next time I will try the tri-tip sandwich. Wife and daughter enjoyed their burger also. We have had better, but we also have had worse! So do not get your expectation up so high, but I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Not great.  Barely good.  Tri-tip sandwich had \"tough\" tri-tip and it fell apart with the effort of trying to tear the meat during a bite.

Kids didn't like their burgers as well as they like In-N-Out.  The fries were decent, but the onion rings were crispy and the onion was overpowered by crust.

Doubtful we will return.  I had hopes for this place, as not many joints offer tri-tip, which is one of my favorite cuts of meat.

(sad face)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food burger places ever. The burgers and the chicken sandwich here are easily among the best for the cost. They blow the hell out of In N Out burger hands down. 
I wish we had one here in Missoula."}
{"text":"I have never heard of this place. We were looking for a place close to our hotel and found this on Yelp. Glad we did.
This is now my second favorite chain burger place. The burger was awesome and the fried chicken sandwich was also amazing 
This place blows away in and out burger but hell, who doesn't ."}
{"text":"I came here because of rave reviews from my brother, but ultimately I left somewhat disappointed. I was thinking this was going to be cross between fast food and gourmet burgers, but I was kinda hoping it was going to err a bit more to the side of gourmet than fast food.

It IS fast food, albeit slightly more healthy because of some options that one might find only at a more gourmet place. But ultimately, it falls short for me. It has more options than In and Out, but fewer options than Carl's Jr. They do not offer a Turkey patty, which I would have greatly appreciated. They do have a chicken sandwich and some salads, but I came for a burger, not a sandwich or salad. They have a veggie burger which comes on a wheat bun with cucumbers and sprouts and some sort of honey mustard stuff and avocado is an option. But the patty is just Morningstar Farms/Garden burger thing that although being cooked well just didnt give me any sort of wow factor.

I ordered regular fries, though I could have ordered sweet potato fries or onion rings, which were cooked nicely but were completely unsalted. They spent a little time on presentation with a lettuce leaf and an orange slice which looked pretty but seemed pointless.

Im not saying it was bad by any means, just not what I was looking for, and frankly Id rather go to Carl's Jr. if Im in the mood for this kind of burger. They're faster, they have more options that include turkey burgers, and they're a bit more upfront about just how gourmet they really are."}
{"text":"Live in the area and have had it before in la so had to come check it out. Good food and great fries. Giving it a 3 because of service. The girl when taking our order looked like a deer in the headlights. Got two burgers for here and one to go. Went to go get my order and discovered one of the cheeseburgers I had didn't have cheese on it so they remade it. Not big of a deal but still. Also thought the burgers were very peppery and even still have the after taste of it.  Will not be rushing back again for another burger."}
{"text":"Habit Burger is a great place to eat when you want a clean burger joint with very delicious food that's fresh.  I love the fries and green beans as my top two sides. They have sweet potato fries too for those who like a sweet side option."}
{"text":"Service was great, employees where helpful and friendly.   Burger was average ... The fries were below average at best they were soggy and lacked salt."}
{"text":"Nothing seemed fresh... Everything had a premade/frozen taste to it. Not impressed :( Pretty positive the veggie burger was a frozen morning star burger. Ahi was not sushi grade, it was white not fresh pink/purple."}
{"text":"Well to be completely honest, their veggie burger was gross. The bun seemed freshly out of the freezer and the patty wasn't any better. My sister had a regular burger and seemed to really enjoy it. They also forgot my French fries :( and yes, I did pay for them. Their chicken salads however, got my stamp of approval!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a fast food burger joint...
 they have healthier food choices like veggie burgers And love instead of a hamburger bun you can have sourdough bread"}
{"text":"Simple menu, everything cooked correctly and was delicious.
Fair pricing and very friendly, genuine, service. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Service was good, food is nothing different than Five Guys, just more variety.  But if you want more than a burger plan on spending more $$ than Five Guys
We did return after the initial visit & everyone that had the same chicken sandwich all GOT SICK!!
Time to find another place"}
{"text":"2 problems. 1. I ordered the Santa Barbara with Bacon and on a regular bun. Got in my car, drove home and No avacado in my burger. Never did i say, \"Hey take out the avacado\" but the person who made it, got confused by my request! 2., Sophia, who took my order was yapping and yapping about hair and nails with the one customer ahead of me. I waited more for their conversation to end than for the chef to f-up my burger! Bad experience. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"It's been a little over 3 years since I last visited this Habit Burger. The parking lot is still a scary mess, the eat-in space is way too small, and the outside misted eating area is only OK in the winter (way too hot for summer). The tables were all dirty, the floor needed cleaning, the trash bins were overflowing. Interestingly, there were two cups on the counter for tips (really, tips at a fast food restaurant???). 
I had the tri tip steak sandwich on a toasted french roll with grilled onions ( $7.39 with tax). Some of the pieces of steak were tender, some were tough and chewy with a bland taste. The toasted French roll held up well (the other choices were a whole grain bun or toasted sour dough bread). Tomato on the sandwich was under-ripe and it had way too much mayo. There was a thin slice of orange as a garnish.
This is still a less than average fast food option."}
{"text":"This is just what Tempe needs! A quick, friendly family place. The salads are great, surprisingly for a hamburger joint. But, what I realized is this isn't a hamburger joint at all. My boyfriend is addicted to the tri tip sandwiches. I love the shakes :) great spot, its always busy but not overwhelming. Instant fan!"}
{"text":"Lot like burger king. Beef is pretty dry but they throw enough mayo on it to try and moist it up some. I have been there 3 times and 2 out of 3 the order was wrong. While you're trying to order they're asking if you want this or want that. If they would just keep their mouth shut and listen they could probably get it right."}
{"text":"This location is the absolute worst. 3 out of 4 of the last times I ordered out from there I got all the way home and something was missing and I had to drive all the way back. Just now they forgot my daughters onion rings so I went back to get them, got home and there was a whopping 3 burnt to a crisp onion rings in the bag. Thoroughly disgusted with this place since they aren't exactly cheap. I will never go back there"}
{"text":"We needed something quick so we decide to try the Habit. Our meals were ok not great flavor. We both felt our sandwiches were so runny they were hard to pick up to eat. The fries were the best part of the meal. Pretty much average food."}
{"text":"Soggiest fries in the valley. Lifted bag up when I was getting out and it bottomed out in my car from being so soaked. I'll create a habit elsewhere, two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Gross. Weird texture burger meat, salty everything, and greasy....
Not a fan ... won't be back ..."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh and crisp burgers.  Keto friendly without the bun and extra bacon!  So delicious."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try The Habit for a while now and was pleasantly surprised!  

I had the Charburger with American cheese, onion rings, and a chocolate shake.  I was a little surprised that I had to pay extra for cheese - especially when there were only 2 choices (American or Swiss).  I may have added on avocado, too, if it wasn't $1.00 (mainly because I can buy an entire avocado for that price across the street at Safeway...).  The burger was really good but the onion rings were EXCELLENT - and believe me - I know my onion rings! :)  They were thickly coated and perfectly cooked.  There were no puddles of grease left behind, either.  You know what was odd, though?  When I asked for ranch for my rings, they gave it to me - for free!  They'll give me a huge cup of ranch for free, but charge a whole dollar for avocado? Not sure how that makes sense, BUT - it was tasty, so whatever.  The chocolate shake was only okay - it tasted very strongly of Hershey's chocolate syrup...there's gotta be a better way to make a shake, no?

Overall I was pleased with my visit and will definitely go back when I need a burger and rings fix."}
{"text":"Love this place.   I made a mess of myself; I dripping in onions, mayonnaise, onions jalapeños, bacon, avocado and BBQ sauce.    I don't care that I now need a shower.   This place is immaculately clean, friendly employees, freshly grilled patties and many non-alcoholic beverage choices.   Very satisfied."}
{"text":"Great fries and great panko battered green beans , which were a first for me.  The char on the burger was perfect and the bacon was thick and cooked just right   This place definitely knows what they're doing. I ordered online and as a courtesy they fry your fries and green beans right when you get there so they're Super Fresh.  I can't wait to try their shakes next time."}
{"text":"Awesomeness!! Love the burgers and fried green beans. Fried green beans?? [ : ) Yessss...Yummy... They also have sweet potato fries as well as the standard. I've never been disappointed in my food choice. They offer a tea variety, some very sweet, some not. The tea and soda are serve yourself. I like that! Parking is limited but people are usually in and out rather quickly. The Habit offers outdoor dining. However, there is nothing quiet about the outdoor dining area as it is right on Glendale Ave.  It's a fast food set up. Counter order & pick up your food when your hand held buzzer buzzes. Very reasonably priced. All in all it's a big thumbs up. It's a happy chow down time."}
{"text":"It's almost as good as In and Out only you pay more....oh, and the fries aren't as good."}
{"text":"My new favorite burger, forget Smashburger and In and Out!  I used to drive all the way down south, so happy to have one in the neighborhood :D"}
{"text":"Pretty sure I've already 5 starred the original location - Habit is the best burger hands down.  So happy to have one up in my neck of the woods! 
Beats In n Out :P"}
{"text":"We stumbled onto the Habit Grill while out one Saturday.  I had the veggie burger and it was quite delicious. The service was great and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Tried The Habit one night after a long afternoon at the nearby rink.  A group of us decided to give it a go as none of us had ever been there before.  It has a diner-like feel but it wasn't objectionable.  You order at the front counter and then the food is delivered a short while later. The burgers were good enough and tasty and came with a decent amount of condiments and toppings such as lettuce, tomato and grilled onions.  I did think that the patties were a tad on the small side considering the price.  The sweet potato fries were rather tasteless and needed more flavor.  Some of my friends had the shakes and said that they were really good although I didn't try one.  I would give The Habit another try.  It surely was good enough."}
{"text":"Veggie burger with avocado and grilled onions omg the best I've ever had! Not to mention the service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Been to the one in Chandler. Good charburger and milkshake. They had a lot of people working so food was pretty quick.  This one has fairly late hours, open Sunday and has a drive-thru.  Nice alternative to In-n-Out."}
{"text":"Service was real helpful for it being my first time there. Music playing on the speakers made it a fun experience. The staff continuously keeps the place clean. The chicken club was really good!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand the high ratings this place has. Let me explain why I am giving it 2 stars. I'm traveling from out of town on business and staying at the residence inn right behind this burger joint. It is easily accessible so I thought I'd try it out. We don't have these in Colorado, so I was excited to try something new. I enjoy that they have a simplistic menu, and it's easy to order. I've been three times now, and EVERY TIME I've gone, my burger was very undercooked. It was cooked well until I got you the center, where the meat was still a dark shade of pink/red. For a quick burger place like this, they should be cooked all the way through. It was too soft to be considered cooked all the way. The first two times I let it go, thinking maybe they were in a hurry cause it was somewhat busy, but they weren't swamped. The last time I went, once again I got an undercooked burger. This time it was not busy at all. They have choices of sides if you don't want fries, but they actually have pretty good fries so I got them as well as the tempura green beans. My food came out fast (again because it was undercooked) and I started eating the green beans. I got three in, pulled out the next one, and there was a long, fine hair stuck to the batter. I wanted to throw up. Needless to say, I walked back to the place (I got my order to go and took it to my hotel room) and talked to the manager. She first offered to make me my entire order fresh again, since now my burger and fries went cold, but I refused. It killed my appetite. She then tried to give me some kind of credit for next time - you've got to be kidding! There won't be a next time. I won't go back there, and we don't have these in Colorado. I told her I just wanted a refund so I can go to the Panera next door instead. She said OK, and I got a refund. 

Overall, their burgers don't taste bad, but they aren't great. They could use better seasoning and less salt. Always undercooked. Want a better burger? Go to five guys. It's a mile away near the target, and they are ALWAYS good. They get 2 stars instead of one because they at least have good customer service."}
{"text":"First visit and it certainly won't be the last! The food was delicious, I had the BBQ bacon char burger and onion rings. The burger was great and the rings might be the best I've ever had. I will be returning and trying one of their shakes for dessert next time."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!!!! Aside from how good the food is, the restaurant is very clean and the staff is great."}
{"text":"The Habit Burger Grill at the fashion show mall is now one of my new favorite burger joints that's conveniently located inside one of the malls I most frequently visit. 
I never even heard of this place so this was all around an adventure. I wasn't sure about having burgers because I was kinda craving Chinese food and I am so glad I didn't get it. 
I ordered the #2 the double char burger with out onions and fries with a drink 
My friend ordered a burger but unfortunately I dont remember the name of it and tempura green beans. 
When our food was ready my first initial thought was that the burger looked super small. But looks may be deceiving. The meat patties were both juicy and cooked just the way I love (over the grill) i simply love love love charbroiled burgers the flavors are way better then any other burgers (try and change my mind !) Where as my wife don't care how her burger is made as long as it's a burger. For me the icing on the cake was the shredded lettuce, I know I may have said this before but shredded lettuce is the best to put on burgers it can really hold all the juices and sauce together verses it dripping all over the place. The burger is a ten in my book , the fries weren't anything special just regular cut fries. The tempura green beans on the other hand were so good I'm truly looking forward to coming back, definitely will be ordering those. yum! 

Four stars for food -1 star for a dirty food counter ,drink station and dirty bar area where were we're eating. But it was super busy so I get it."}

The Habit is several steps above your bigger, faster hamburger places and not the trendy, boutique burger places that have opened up in the past few years. 

The Habit serves up great burgers, fries, shakes and even salads, but the star attraction at the Habit are the onion rings, they are to die for.  The Habit also offers sweet potato fries if regular potato fries aren't your thing.  However, do yourself a big favor and order the crunchy onion rings, with ranch dressing on the side, you won't be disappointed .

The burgers  at the Habit come dressed in different flavors, but always freshly made and worth the wait.  The Habitb has a condiment bar with peppers and pickles, and there is no extra charge for whatever you want on your burger (grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, etc.) 

The Habit is very reasonably priced. The restaurants are very clean and the staff has always been extremely accomadating.   I would go here any day of the week over other fast food restaurants."}

{"text":"Came here with a group of friends before a Phoenix Mercury game and we arrived at a good time, being it wasn't overly crowded, and we got right up to the register and placed our orders. Upon completion of order and payment, they give you a disc that lights up when your order is ready. We grabbed a table, filled our drinks, and got condiments while waiting for our number to be called. Once our food was ready and we all divided up our orders, we got down to business and enjoyed our meal, re-filling drinks and getting more condiments as we went along.

This was my 2nd time here (first time, I brought my dad here for lunch while he was visiting me from out of state), and just like the first, I really enjoyed it. I learned on this visit, however, that they have added Sweet Potato Fries to their repertoire, so next time, I will definitely gt those with my meal. My friend got them with hers and they looked so tasty!

My burger was cooked to absolute perfection and they put very little lettuce on it, which I prefer, being I have braces and get lettuce caught in my brackets very easily. The fries were perfect...not really salty, which is one big complaint I have about a lot of places. I am so NOT a salt person and can't stand overly-salty foods. 

I recommend The Habit to anyone looking for a new burger place to try. One bit of confusion I must clarify: the drive-up outside is for the Starbucks next door, and people have thought that The Habit has a drive-through. Not the case, unfortunately, but they do offer take-out as well as dine-in."}

{"text":"The Habit is a great alternative to unhealthy fast food. The grilled chicken sandwich on a wheat bun is great. They also have veggie burgers. They do a good job at handling take-out calls and they remember your last order, which is great for me, because I get the same thing all the time."}
{"text":"\"Hamburgers, the cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.\"  I could spout off Pulp Fiction quotes all day, but I'm not reviewing Pulp Fiction.  Suffice it to say, I'm a fan of hamburgers and a fan of the fast-casual burger joint trend that is sweeping the Valley.  Habit Burger fits right into that mold.  No drive-thru, but no waiters, and very cheap prices.  (Burgers start at $3.)

Habit goes with the model of using thin beef patties that you can double up.  This leads to a less juicy product, but it also leads to In & Out Burger comparisons, and that's a tough standard to compete with.  In & Out is even cheaper and carries the nostalgia factor.  The major difference between the two burgers is that In & Out burgers come with \"secret\" ketchup-mayonaise and Habit Burger uses only mayo.

Habit Burger does offer variety though.  They have solid versions of fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  They have sandwiches of chicken, tri-tip or even grilled tuna.  I actually tried their chicken salad once, which was... fine, I guess?  Chicken over lettuce and a few vegetables.  Boring, meets healthy, meets airplane dinner presentation.

There are other perks.  I really liked the chocolate milkshake there.  It was honestly one of the best milkshakes I've ever had.  The jalapeno and pepperoccini bar is a nice touch.  However, I think Habit Burger may be stuck in burger purgatory... or Burgatory, if you will.  (Boo!  I now hate myself.)  For cheap burgers, go to In & Out.  For a better and slightly more expensive carnivorous experience, you're safer with Fatburger or Five Guys."}

This place is AMAZING! my husband and I love it. They have the best food. It's not greasy and it's so fresh and delicious. If you happen to stop by make sure you try the grilled chix sandwich in sourdough! That was my fav it's so delicious. The Chicken is so juicy and has amazing flavor. My husband loved the BBQ char burger. He said that was amazing. I'm so excited that we decided to try this place because it amazing."}

So I had half a chicken sandwich and half a \"salad\" sandwich, no exaggeration!  Staff was friendly, place appeared relatively clean but the noise level with very loud music made it almost impossible to converse.  Even if the food had been twice as good, I wouldn't return.  Prices were somewhat above average, not the greatest value.  Sorry-"}

{"text":"My partner and I went to to the Habit on a Sunday for lunch.  The parking lot was full and there was a bit of a line to order.  We ordered two veggie burgers with mushrooms since we are vegetarians.  We were given a beeper and waited just about 4 minutes until the beeper went off.  The veggie burgers are delicious.  There are real vegetables in the patty and they have great flavor.  It is served on a whole wheat toasted bun and has lettuce, tomato, onion, dijon mustard and sliced cucumber on it.  There are self serve cups for ketchup and various pickles and hot peppers.  We loved every bite!  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  I am thrilled that this is in our neighborhood as I plan to return again and again.  
There are a lot of hamburger places all around but not that many offer a veggie burger.  The Habit does it right!"}
{"text":"I've been craving a hamburger for weeks. With all the holiday goings-on with sweets and treats everywhere, I didn't want to over indulge with a burger. Well forget that! After work yesterday, my craving kicked in again. Fast text to the hubby and I flew off to The Habit. It's where I need to go when I want delicious food.

I certainly over did it this time and I'm really okay with it. I ordered the double meat burger, onion rings, and topped if off with a chocolate shake. (No whipped cream of course, because that's loaded with calories.)

My food was out in no time and the burger was juicy and delicious with perfectly melted cheese and grilled onions that were delectable. The onion rings were hot, I mean piping hot! Once they cooled down a bit, the breading was crunchy and flaky all at the same time. PERFECT! 

Of course my favorite part of the experience is the shake. I must report that it is my all-time favorite shake. No other food establishment comes close to making a shake that is cold, creamy and pure deliciousness.

The ladies room is clean and well maintained as is the entire dining room. There were families, couples and even singles like myself enjoying their food. Outdoor seating is available as well. If there is no parking around the store, there is plenty in plazas large parking lot.

Where your burger craving kicks in, GO TO THE HABIT and enjoy an outstanding burger (onion rings, and shake)!"}
{"text":"Saw this open recently and was curious.  Today after the gym we decided to stop by (gotta put back all those calories we burned in the gym!!).  

Right now this place is rated 3.5 stars, and I would say that's about right. I don't get the 5-star ratings from some reviewers.  Maybe compared to McD's, but there are many places that are better.

I ordered a double-char burger and onion rings.  When it arrived the patties were perfectly round and I recognized that texture.  These patties mass were produced somewhere and shipped out.  Highly processed.  They aren't made by humans.  The buns were basic. Overall the flavor was OK.  Certainly better than McD's or one of those.  I asked for extra onion, and they grilled them.  I didn't expect that, but they were good.  My wife had the portobello char and liked it. Onion rings were nothing special but fine.  The onion rings were cooked perfectly, but the batter clearly had no seasoning.  It was just plain batter.  They were fine, but didn't really 'wow' me.  They put too much salt on them after frying, but that was easy to shake off.

Definitely not worthy of five stars.  But it was fine.  I wouldn't make a point of coming here again, but we might.  Even though it's slightly more expensive I'd probably go to Red Robin first."}
{"text":"Got a coupon for a free charburger. I heard from a friend that the flavor \"is similar to In-n-out but better\". I'm not a HUGE In-n-out fan but it's OK so I tried the Habit. Of course you get the burger free but pay to add fries and a drink as expected. We then apparently made a mistake and asked for \"cheese fries\". (Which, btw, every restaurant I've ever been to can, and does, make.) 

Cashier said \"Uhhhh...I don't know if we can do that. Let me ask the manager.\" Manager comes out and asks what we want. 
I explain again...\"cheese fries...you know...fries with cheese melted on top.\" 
She says no...that they don't have that. 
ME: \"Ok...do you have fries?\" 
MANAGER: \"Yes.\" 
ME: \"Do you have cheese?\" 
MANAGER: \"Yes.\" 
ME: \"Soooo...can you just put the cheese ON the fries?\" 
MANAGER: \"No.\" 
ME: \"Is it about the cost? We can pay for the cheese separately as an extra piece of cheese for a burger and you can just put it on the fries. Would that work?\" 
MANAGER: \"We can't put cheese on your fries.\" 
ME: \"Ok...can you just sell us a piece of cheese?\"
MANAGER: \"Yes.\"

Food comes out, and sure enough in a separate cardboard fry container...a single slice of cheese which we promptly flipped over on top of the fries and VOILA! Cheese fries! 
We made the amazing transformation right at the counter and showed them. I still don't understand why they couldn't just put it on the fries and skip the step and extra trash incurred by putting it in its own container, but whatever. Lol.

So...aside from the cheese fry incident the Habit was...eh. The taste wasn't anything special...probably rather go to In-n-out. The fries (even with cheese on them) weren't very good. The burger patty was very small. I wished I had gotten a double and I don't normally get doubles. The meat to bread/lettuce ratio was terrible. The prices weren't a great deal. I would say I probably wouldn't go back unless I got another free burger coupon and even then, because of the inflexibility of the cheese fry issue I believe I can safely say I won't go back at all. It's not the cheese specifically, it's the inability of the staff (especially the manager) to be helpful and figure out a way to do something so simple that would make a first time visitor want to come back."}
{"text":"\"Respect the burger\"..Man I do after going too the Habit Burger Bar I really do respect how everything thing was great from the great cheese burger, too the fries, too the service.. Only thing that sucks it's far from where I live hope  they build more Habit Burger Bars around the Vegas area  I'll be back"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting The Habit Burger Grill and I have to say this time didn't live up to my first experience. Now I was razzled and dazzled the first time because I had the opportunity of going to a soft opening for the YELP ELITES at the new Blue Diamond location. This time I tried two different items and both were just okay. I didn't get the WOW service nor the WOW taste that I received on my first time trying. Was it bad? No.. Was it Great? No.. Just Good. I wanted to explore the \"Grilled\" items menu this time and went for that Tri-Tip Steak. I ordered mine with everything and selected sourdough bread as you do get to select from three different breads I believe. Just wasn't impressed. For Some reason the bread get's so soggy so quick and the steak was seasoned kind of weird. We also went for the famous double char with everything on it and that one was good! I'd say skip the onion rings because for the price they charge and the amount you get just doesn't equate. Maybe I just came on an off day? Who knows but I won't completely rule out coming back here because I know what they are capable of delivering!"}
{"text":"My first time at Habit and it was delicious. Glad to see one open up so close to home and find a new burger place to enjoy. 

I had the double which was more than enough and fries. My wife had the single and fries and couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"My favorite is the tuna sandwich with the tuna seared on the outside and cooked a little on the inside. I love the sweet potato fries. I'm never dissatisfied when I come here."}
{"text":"Slow service and messed up my order 2 out of the three times I've been here. I ordered sweet potato fries and didn't even get them with my order. The other time I only ordered a shake for my little sister through drive through and waited for more than 20 minutes. Don't go here."}
{"text":"The service was awesome...hands down great customer service. 
The food was mediocre. Same fast food burgers you get almost anywhere. I may be spoiled coming from Austin TX where burgers have to be truly unique to stand out. 
My suggestion is save your money and go to in and out!
On the plus side...they have sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"Very good fresh and fast staff very friendly love they give you a pager that alerts you food is ready."}
{"text":"Very good food!!!  Burger is Tasty, fries are super good!!  Love the burger stuff bar with the different peppers etc!!!  Delish!!"}
{"text":"Always passed this place and seen it pop on so I decided to try it. It wasn't bad. Fries could have been better. But the burger was great. Strawberry lemonade wasn't all that but it got the Jo done. And the wait wasn't incredibly long. ,"}
{"text":"I never knew they opened a restaurant in Vegas but only heard of this place in Santa Barbara. The joint did the veggie burger justice. My partner enjoyed his two orders and we really couldn't have a conversation because our mouths were stuffing every bite down till it was gone in our tummies."}
{"text":"I always think of the word habit as a nice way to describe a drug problem. For example, Whitney Houston's coke habit (too soon?) or Heidi Montag's plastic surgery habit. I would say that I might have a Habit problem since I eat here about 4 times a week. 

Think of Habit as the love child from an orgy between In-n-Out, Five Guys, and Smashburger, but cheaper and more delicious. It is from California like INO, it has many topping choices like Five Guys, and it has other non burger options like Smashburger (although, no alcohol unfortunately).

I've had almost everything on the menu, and I highly recommend the Swiss Mushroom Char and the Albacore Tuna Sandwich. The Sweet Potato Fries are very good. I would actually say that they are better than anything I've had at more expensive burger joints (*cough* that means step up your game, delux and FEZ *cough*).

The malts and milkshakes are pretty good also. I haven't tried requesting anything crazy like a Neapolitan shake, but I don't doubt that they would make that for me. 

All in all, this is a great regular spot because it is cheap and consistently delicious. And consistency is a very rare quality to find in these kind of fast food-like restaurants."}
{"text":"Consistently good burgers and chicken, love the strawberry limeade, and overall cleanliness of the restaurant!  What's great about this location - the friendly and honest servers.  When the gentleman who took our ordered noticed he over charged us after we already sat down, he walked over to us and told us what happened and gave us back our money.  Now that's integrity!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood burger place. Burgers always taste fresh and juicy. Fries and onion rings are both delish. Patio is a great plus on nights that have good weather."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit. Very friendly service. Nice and clean. Diet coke was great. Had a strawberry shake which was yummy. Fries very good because they where fresh. I would say very standard nothing out of the ordinary. Burger made to order wish I realized I could have got avacado that would have rocked. I think I probably prefer smash and my favorite in out. If you like those you will like this place. My experience here was 5 stars just that if I give innout a five and smash a four this would be a three. Mainly based on the fact it is just a greasy burger. If you like your burger juicy with lots of fat this is for you. I just prefer something less greasy. That being said this place is very good"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday, the bill my friend and I came to $25.00. ( 2 cheeseburgers, 2 regular drinks and one order of fries) I asked the husky blondish beard sportin  cashier if this would be enough to fill me up? He assured me it would be but \"if not just to let him know.\"Well I was still hungry afterwards and he overheard me by the drink machine say I was still hungry. (which I truly was, the cheeseburger was delicious but smaller than I expected) He promptly said he would make me a shake of my choice.....I was like really, ok. He gave me a chocolate cherry shake immediately. He obviously knows the value of giving good customer service because even though Habit burgers are a little pricey, I will definitely make it a HABIT to eat here again just BECAUSE of the STELLAR customer service I received from this guy. I called to get his name and their order taking service was unable to give it to me. He deserves a raise,,,,that boy gets it.
Thank You"}
{"text":"It's nice to see a chain that is committed to doing something and doing it well. We have a local Habit restaurant here in California. On a whim, we decided to drop into one near our hotel in Phoenix last week. Both my wife and I ordered the same thing we always do--mostly to see if the experience was consistent. Well it was. Consistently yummy, might I add.... If you find yourself in Chandler with a hankering for a great burger, I highly recommend the Habit.

4 out of 5 stars for the food being a little on the pricey side for the amount that you get. But who am I to quibble, we'll still be back."}
{"text":"Very good sweet potato fries.  The avocado chicken sandwich was very good.  A little pricey for what it is, but a solid choice."}
{"text":"Yet another burger joint.

The Habit seems to have borrowed some elements from In-N-Out and some elements from Smashburger to come up with their restaurant.

The burgers are pretty average. The sweet potato fries would be better if they weren't coated in some kind of batter.

The rest of my family raved about how much they loved the food. I suspect that I would be more enamored with it if it weren't the umpteenth million paint by numbers burger \"concept\" I've eaten in this year. Maybe if you're less cynical you'll enjoy your burger more than I did."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food and friendly service. I usually get the golden chicken sandwich and onion rings, with ranch dressing, of course."}
{"text":"Overrated and flat-out nasty.  

My stomach is still turning from the blandest, most boring, luke warm bacon cheeseburger I've ever had.  Anyone who gives this joint a positive review should be slapped and banned from yelp.  Absolutely gross, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at Habit during a recent visit to San Diego.  The current LV location is a bit of a drive from my house but I was craving Habit so we loaded up and made the trek.  We got there in 18 minutes which by Vegas standards is forever.  
   They have plenty of parking and once inside the interior is very nice.  Despite being fast Casual they have a classy looking interior.  One of the nicest interiors in comparison to their completion.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We quickly ordered and sat down for the short wait for our food to be made fresh.
   We got the Santa Barbara Burger,  Doulde Char with added Mushrooms, Onion rings, Tempura Green Beans and Sweet potato Fries.  Within 10 minutes our meal was ready.  We were excited to enjoy Habit again as it was very good the last time we had them.  We were not disappointed.  The Santa Barbara was delicious.  The sourdough with just the right amount of butter and toasted perfectly were exactly what I was craving.  The avocado with caramelized onions are a great addition and added to the enjoyable flavor of the burger.  The Double Char with mushrooms was also a delicious treat.  The caramelized onions are so tasty on a burger and add in the mushrooms and this was just what I was craving.   
   The sweet potato fries are so good.  Sweet and crispy which is just what you need with a good burger.  The Onion rings were also very good.  They were crisp but not crumbly and very tasty.  We regretted not ordering 2 orders of onion rings as splitting them became a problem.  The Tempura green Beans were also very good.  I know some don't like them but I have to say I am a fan.  All in all we had a very good meal.  
   Habit is opening a location in SW Vegas off Blue Diamond. So looking forward to having them within 5 minutes of my house.  It will be great to have another choice other than In N Out for the good Burger cravings.   Who knows I may have to have a Burger Fest with both - sweet!"}
{"text":"Extraordinarily yummy food, great service, clean and close to home. Try the killer burgers, salads and those awesome Tempura Green Beans!"}
{"text":"Two words, \"Fucking Awesome\"! I love this place! It's my Favorite Burger Joint now... Prices are surprisingly reasonable for the quality and portions of their meals... Customer service was great! I used to be a Farmer Boys kinda guy, but not anymore... I've found me a new Habit! :)"}
{"text":"Wow worse burger ever.. its worse then Jack in the box! Ordered the shake too man it was so watered down n nasty! How do you screw up a milk shake???"}
{"text":"Loved this joint! Sat outside on a warm fall evening and enjoyed our experience. The burger was done perfectly, and the ingredients were fresh. Fries were pretty good as well. The burgers came quick and the service was friendly, too. The only downfall was my burger came out incorrect, but it was quickly taken care of and done with a smile and an apology. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Habit. Upon first glance, you may think it is just another burger place (which I did) but then after trying it, you realize it's more than that!

My go to is usually a Veggie Burger (add Avacado) and an order of either Tempura Green Beans or Onion Rings. When I was eating low carb, I would do the Double Charburger with Cheese, hold the bun...and OH MAN was that is a good burger! Not eating the bun really gives you an idea of the quality of the burger.

SIDE NOTE: No matter what you get here, ALWAYS get a side of ranch. Habit has some of the best ranch I have had and if you get any of the sides, it is the only dipping sauce you will need! 

Service is always great. Very friendly people. You will wait a little bit longer than a standard fast food place, however this isn't a typical fast food place so the extra 5 minute wait is worth every single bite.

This Habit is the closest to my house and the location I visit most, however I have been to a few around town and they all have the same great food quality and service."}
{"text":"OMG!  We've been to the Habit a few times for their burger, but the Tri-Tip sandwich is the bomb!  We ordered it with teriyaki sauce. My husband ordered it with grilled onions-I did not. It is one of the best steak sandwiches I've had. I may never go back to eating a burger there again."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about yet still decent enough to return. I would rate their burgers one step below Five-Guys and two steps above Smashburger. I like that they offer onion rings (which were delicious) and shakes (which were good but small). The pricing is on par with the other hamburger joints mentioned earlier. The fries are just meh. I would recommend the mocha shake though I didn't taste any coffee in it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! Just another unique burger joint! Wouldn't compare it to others but similar to smash burger and five guys. They have chicken too as well as salads!"}
{"text":"Really good food and service. Was there for a charity night where all proceeds went to help others. The manager Marquee is such an amazing women. She sat and talked with us and made us feel comfortable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this Habit Burger Grill. Most I've been too are delicious. This one was so chaotic and not the cleanest. They may have been short staffed but the employees were very nice. The food was not good. Almost like it was made in a rush. My Bun was so burned. Won't eat at this one again."}
{"text":"The Habit burger Grill is part of the reason Burger King and McDonalds is struggling.  For about the same price at The Habit that you might spend at one of the other guys, the food is just so much better.  Grilled burgers the way a burger shoud be prepared.  I ordered the Teriyiki char-burger.  It had a teriyaki glaze, Grilled pineapple, mayonnaise, pickle, swiss cheese,fresh tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions on a toasted bun. Sooooo good and I think it costs $3.69.  I also ordered a side order of Tempura Green Beans. Fresh-cut green beans lightly battered and flash fried to perfection. I honestly am not a big fan of green beans but you MUST try these.  This is how green beans should be prepared.  The staff was super friendly and at one point someone came to our table to make sure everything was ok.  It you have not tried The habit Burger Grill, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"As I have been working on losing 50 lbs (down 30 so far since July) the Habit is a special occasion, cheat day treat.  For around $4 you get a beautifully char grilled burger made to order.  

Being a pineapple fan, I always order the Teriyaki Charburger which comes with Grilled pineapple, mayonnaise, pickle, fresh tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions on a toasted bun.  Are you hungry yet?  The staff is always friendly and the restaurant always clean.  The place with the golden arches might learn a thing or two if they checked out The Habit."}
{"text":"I don't know where all the good reviews come from. This place is a step above McDonalds. I've been to multiple locations on multiple occasions, they all have been underwhelming. I eat burgers probably once a week, but only quality. If I want a real burger, I go Bar Code on flamingo."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood on business and visited The Habit for the 1st time. Burger was awesome. Staff is friendly. Atmosphere is great and very clean. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honestly impressed. Thought this would be another over rated burger gimic joint, but was pleasantly suprised. Much like a 1950's dinner with a modern overhaul. Hamburgers were delicous. Meat was hot, veggies were cold, all toppings were proportionate and we'll dispersed. Malted shakes had great flavor. Onion rings were a little heavy on the breading ratio but still yummy and crisp. Also tried the tuna on sourdough. Everything was good. Defidently worth the trip."}
{"text":"Marginal burgers at best. I had the California Char. The burgers themselves were small, dry and tasteless. The rest of the sandwich was fine and the fries were good. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is good. Three stars because the lobby is way way way too small for their volume of business and the seating is uncomfortable.  If the dinning room is empty, stop for a good meal.  
Oh, and no dr pepper!  That's a demerit.  Every all Pepsi or all coke place usually also has a dr pepper contract too. How lazy..."}
{"text":"I was loving this cobb salad until I found a strand of hair in it.  And now I'm so mad that I have to throw it away!  UGH!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, we got the double char combo and it was sooooo tasty. Very flavourful. 

There's a nice atmosphere in here, very friendly staff and very clean. We had a choice of large tables to sit at so had plenty of room to put our food out on the table. 

Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin honestly this place never disappoints.  There's several different restaurants on this street where you can grab something to eat, and The Habit has to be one of the top ones in my opinion. The service is always above and beyond everytime I've gone in. Not to mention the burgers are delicious! Definately worth checking out."}
{"text":"The staff was really friendly and nice. Ordered their Charburger and it was good. Pretty much tasted like your average burger. Nothing very special about it. My brother ordered their BBQ burger which he said was good too. 

No complaints. The restaurant was very clean and organized. The prices were reasonable, not crazy expensive. Would go there again for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since we first found them in CA. Everything is made fresh. No cheese and add avocado is the way to go. Sweet potato fries are awesome. Keep in mind that it is not FAST food. You order and that's when your meat goes on the grill. It will take a few minutes but it's worth it. The chicken and tuna sandwiches also allow healthy eating and are delicious."}
{"text":"I am from Santa Barbara born and raised and the Habit is an institution there! I am so glad a slice of home is here in Henderson! It tastes exactly like the original located on Hollister Ave! It doesn't matter what you get everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Haven't had Habit Burgers at this location - but Yay!!! Habit comes to Vegas!  Woo-Hoo!  Will be there as soon as I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Ive been recommended this place a million times do when one opened up near i live i was so excited. First, the service was amazing. I ordered online for pickup and my food was ready when they said it would be. The staff working there were also very enjoyable. 

I had the Teriyaki Chicken sandwich, which was phenomenal. The fried here are also top-notch. I cant attest to the burger, but my brother said it was really good. 

Overall i would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Overall good burger and prices decent. Just a burger spot to add like all the others in the area no more or less. Would go again."}
{"text":"We saw that this place opened up fairly close to our home. It's always so busy so we opted for the drive-thru. Even the drive-thru was busy... That didn't stop us from visiting this new joint though. They weren't very helpful... They knew we were first timers. Usually when they ask us if we've ever been and someone says no... The cashier usually suggests something. 

While the drive-thru line was packed... It took about 10 minutes for us. To me, that's quick! Considering the amount of people there was before us. We took our burgers to the park and ate there. I felt like the fries were extremely soggy and that my turkey burger was very sloppy. 

I usually give places 2 tries before writing a review, but eh... I don't think I would be rushing my tush back over anytime soon."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for lunch today since it had been over a year since the last time I was at The Habit. The first time I had a Tuna burger which was good but was craving a regular burger this time. I got there right at noon and it was already very crowded and I had to park down the street since the parking lot was full. No huge biggie....I have a very short wait and had the #1 Charburger with cheese, fries and a drink (combo meal). I found the last table open inside as it was a tad warm to sit outside and grabbed my drink. I only waited a few minutes before my pager was going off that my burger and fries were ready. The burger was great and the fries were too. I normally order crispy fries and this time I didn't. They were still very good but will order them crispy next time.

The staff was extremely friendly and the restaurant was very clean. I know I will be back again for lunch!"}
{"text":"The burgers aren't really anything special, but taste good. Got a simple char burger, quite good. It has a really nice crunch in all burgers, even with no bacon.

Fries and onion rings are also very good."}
{"text":"From the tri-tip to the burgers, everything is awesome here! Everyone from my wife to my kids who I have brought here absolutely loves it. Great food, great service and reasonably priced. Wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience with the Habit, and I definitely prefer this place over In-n-out any day. The char burger is my go to item, but I decided to try their new golden chicken sandwich. Golden indeed it was, fried to perfection, crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, topped with a creamy red pepper sauce. I think it's for a limited time only so try it when you can! Their tempura green beans and onion rings are always really tasty and crunchy. Our fries were a little stale this time, but it could have just been a bad batch. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"2/22/13, Fri...So we finally decided to try this place after we saw Cory McKlosky from FOX Morning News (...i know, i know...don't  ask...not a FOX News fan at all), but anyway, Not a good 1st impression right off the bat... There were 2 guys goofing around/teasing with the cashier girl, both being loud & kind of obnoxious for several minutes as we were waiting behind them to place our order. Finally, a 2nd cashier girl came to get or order.  I had ordered the Sourdough Grilled BBQ  Chicken Sandwich.... They made it with a Wheat bun instead! I got the manager, Maggy, she was super sweet & quite apologetic. And my partner ordered a double char burger, but it was the bun that was charred & dried out, & hard. I decided to just go ahead & eat mine, but my partner had re-ordered his.  We also got sweet potato fries...nothing special... kinda disappointed...Nothing like the Cinnamon-Dusted Sweet Pototao Fries at FEZ on Central! Damn, those are good, anyway,...I also ordered a strawberry shake...Again, I was kind of disappointed... It was like ice milk, not creamy at all like they are at IN-N-OUT BURGER, which is the KING of burger places... Doulble-Double kicks @$$ by far, which are HUGE, back in So Cal where I'm from. Anyway, wasn't too fond of the strawberry flavor...so, I got it exchanged for chocolate which was a littlle better...So to make this long story short, (too late, lol), we will probably not be returning here.  Seems like they're trying to be like SMASH Burger."}
{"text":"The habit is usually one of my favorite burger places to go, and I'm ALWAYS happy when I go there. Except 2 nights ago when I order 2 double Char's for my mother and me, and we proceeded to get very sick. Spent our nights in the bathroom. We realized halfway through our burger that it wasn't fresh, And the meat wasnt even cooked properly. Seemed it was still raw. Wasted my time and money. Was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is unfortunate..bit into a bone in my chicken sandwich. This is 7 years after trying this place when I bit into sharp fish skin on the tuna sandwich. Should've had a burger maybe but I don't believe I'll be going back.
Picture included"}
{"text":"Wow! This was my first time and I am a fan! The double char I had was superb! I had the option to have it has a lettuce wrap and i subbed in avacado instead of cheese  They also had tempura fried green beans which were really good as a side instead of fries. this was a great place for lunch and is really near my house! i got the Habit and will return!"}
{"text":"Like an in and out , but not! I got burger combo , 24% more than in and out. 

Fries are good, the burger , not.  It was like a Big Mac , bun too small for the burger and to much sauce made it all slide around in bun, falling off onto the table . 

I'm staying with in and out . If you want to pay more and get less, as in quality and taste , go here .

I'll not be getting into the habit"}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have the BEST menu for a burger place. The healthy choices are a great option and the staff is amazing!! I will definitely be back many time to try all the different items on their menu."}
{"text":"I would love to give a better review because the burgers & fries are ok, but literally EVERY time I have been there they have messed up the order....every. single. time. Including tonight....nothing complicated on the order, but specifying \"no cheese\" on one of the 3 burgers & what did we get? 3 burgers with cheese. And they are always cold...I do not have to drive far to get home from Habit, and it's not that they are no longer hot...they are cold. Needless to say, I'm done. This place isn't worth it at all."}
{"text":"Came in earlier this week after having the most appalling and frustrating few days I have ever had. I was on the brink when I was ordering my food and realized I had forgotten my wallet. I had waited in line 10 minutes and was starving after having a terrible last few days. Long story short, I started hysterically crying right at the cash register, I mumbled a few things about my order and that I would be back to pay through ugly mascara drowned tears. The manager (female, looks kinda like Moana from Disney, don't know her name) took my order perfectly despite me sobbing and then comped my meal. I ate for free! It was such an act of kindness and she even told me a few encouraging words. Had to let the people know of such a kind individual, also the food is amazing. Thanks Moana!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that it's taken me this long to review the Habit Burger. Being from Southern California, In n Out was always at the top of the fast food burger chain, but the habit sure does give it a run for its money. Every time I go to the habit I know I'm gonna get a consistent good tasting meal. Burgers are always nice and juicy and the caramelized onions are great. Their sides are also fantastic. Fried green beans and onion rings are delicious. Their ranch and thousand island dressing are on point too. I love how they have the hot chilis so you can use them on your burger if you like. Lastly, their specialty drink is freaking great. They know how to make a mean burger, and sides, and sauces, and drinks. They do the dang thing."}
{"text":"I love this place. The burgers are delicious, flavorful and soft. A little expensive, but worth it. I love the fries and array of sauces, I always use A1 on my fries and can't find that everywhere. The staff is friendly and helpful and I don't have a bad word to say about this place. If you don't like it, you're wrong."}
{"text":"Got the free coupon, so we headed there for lunch today.  I was surprised, the burger was a lot better than I expected! Filing, juicy, fresh toppings.  The fries were above-average, but for what it's worth, I can't stand Five Guys fries or In N Out's.  So if you're a big fan of those, you may not agree with me here.  Super clean place, friendly staff.  Lots of parking for now...until Potbelly opens in a couple of weeks and the lot will be packed (sidenote:  I will pass up Habit for Potbelly every day of the week, but that's a different review.)

Overall good burger and fries.  I'd like to try something else off the menu next time. That being said, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great food period!  Just check out the drive thru at dinner time, that tells the whole story!!!"}
{"text":"First experience was ok, second was amazing! This place does a solid burger! As far as fast food, we will be back"}
{"text":"A friend told me that they had great burgers but I was a little skeptical. So I decided to take a risk on eating at just another burger joint but to my surprise I was amazed! This place has a great hamburger and obliterates most burger chains.  Great price and good fries. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Always a really good cheeseburger.    And the batter fried string beans are yummy.  They do excel in customer service at any of the locations.  Nice to get catered to even if it's fast food.   Kudos to management on that"}
{"text":"New Habit opens on Blue Diamond And Decatur.      Great food.  Great staff.    Best burgers ever.      Always eat in the one in Santa Barbara.      Can't beat that one because of the outside seating but this one comes close."}
{"text":"Our family really loves the burgers here.  Every location we have been to is clean. The food is fresh and made to order. I especially love their strawberry limeade!!!  This location has plenty of parking available as well as tables to sit down."}
{"text":"I have been coming in here for awhile now, I can honesty say I've never had a bad experience dining in or taking food home. Speaking of the food, it's delicious! I love the double and sweet potato fries combo, the variety of tea is always a pleasant surprise as I don't drink soda at what so ever. 

The staff is always super friendly, the manager on staff is also incredibly nice and helpful! Dining in is always a pleasure, the atmosphere is great, typically just an overall good experience. I would definitely suggest swinging by at some point and giving this place a try! You're sure to become a repeat customer, dare I say, it becomes a habit?"}
{"text":"My recommendation,

Head over the overpass to 5 guys.  It's next to Einstein's and is a much better burger.  Or, there is always In'N'Out which is still a better fast food burger.  If you're in the mood for a Really Good burger, head out to Old Town Scottsdale and check out Rehab Burger."}
{"text":"had a good Burger, shake ,fries and onion rings ..  was my cheat meal lol .. anyway everything was good glad we have a good fast burger on the west side .    service was awesome especially for a drive threw ..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mushroom Char & the tempura green beans(A great alternative to French fries & they're so delicious). And their burgers taste fresh...Made to order 
Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger drive-thru & second bite into my burger I bit into a toothpick. Very disappointed! Will never go back. I tried calling but was already closed since they only drive-thru till midnight. Tried calling the following day & got recording to send emails only.."}
{"text":"I went to The Habit Burger Grill for lunch with a friend on Thursday around 12. We took the Albacore burger and the Tri-Tip Steak burger along with sweet potato fries, fried green beans and a Sundae, and everything tasted very good. The price is also rather reasonable given what you get but the dessert selection is pretty much the same as what you would get in any other fast food.

The restaurant was rather empty when we arrived so we were able to order right away. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant is located on Blue Diamond Road right by I15 which makes it easy to access. The restaurant also offers a large parking lot which means that you won't have any problem to park.

Overall, my experience with The Habit Burger Grill  was positive and I would recommend it. This is a better fast food restaurant than your average one. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Fresh vegetables on a bun with hardly any meat. My advice. . . get the double. 

PROS:  Flame broiled
             Strawberry lemonade (homemade)

CONS:  Not enough meat on the burger"}
{"text":"Great to go please for a quick delicious burger and my fav the fried green beans!!! Enjoy the patio and eat outside while you still can. The bathrooms are unbelievably clean! Resonantly priced as well for what you get!  I wouldn't make this place a Habit though!!"}
{"text":"Tried Habit today with my husband and dad. I had the Tri tip sandwich with just cooked onions and loved it. Juicy and tender meat, pink in the middle with a sesame roll and tempura green beans which were banging! Crunchy side without the French fry guilt. My dad and husband find something wrong everywhere we go. Dad had the Tri tip on sourdough and was saying he wasn't coming back because they forgot to give him his teriyaki sauce, otherwise he'd rather go to Johnny Rockets.  My husband got the burger but even though I told him to ask for medium based on other comments, he didn't so he said it was like eating a hockey puck. He said the pickles were limp and hated the shredded lettuce. They also put the wrong cheese on the burger. Next time they want lunch, they are going to Rio and I'm going to Habit. Gave 4 stars because these two guys complain about any place but they did give hubby the wrong cheese. I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff.
I had the cheeseburger, which looked great. The burgers are super juicy, but they're missing flavor. Food was just 'okay'."}
{"text":"Checked out Burger Habit for lunch with my husband and son. Right away we noticed the friendly staff helping the customers. There were two senior ladies who needed a little extra help and the staff went out of their way to accommodate them. We also had two managers ask us about our lunch as we ate. When the senior ladies were leaving the manager not only walked them out, held the door asked about their meal but then proceeded to walk them to their car and hold open the door. I will definitely return to this establishment for the customer service and bonus - the food was good!"}
{"text":"Being from So Cal I love the Habit. Burgers are huge and delicious, onion rings hot and crisp and they're shakes are just heaven sent. They're new to the Valley so expect some lines around the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Burger(s) is good but the tri tip steak sandwich could be better you take one bite and yank out half the steak in the sandwich with that one bite because they don't cut it up all that good. It was still good though.. I do plan on returning son."}
{"text":"Yelp did not steer us wrong. The burgers are delicious. Love the onions. The fries were hot delicious strawberry limeade. Nice service."}
{"text":"Wish I would have read the reviews before going here!! First of all, it is very noisy and to add extremely loud music on top of that was irritating. The interior is nice and new, but it was filthy! Puddles of I don't know what in front of the soda machine, all the tables were not cleaned. Didn't want to venture into the restroom! When our food arrived, it looked good, but the onion rings tasted like they were cooked in the same oil as fish. I couldn't even eat them. My bun was so burned, it was black and hard, I didn't eat that either. The fries were over cooked too.
I was watching the kitchen like it was a train wreck!! The garbage can was overflowing, but the cook kept dumping into it and everything he threw in there fell on the floor. He finally shoved the garbage down into the can(with his hand) and then turned around and continued cooking without changing his glove!!! We were so disgusted by then that we didn't finish our burgers and left! We won't be back."}
{"text":"Good clean steak sandwich prepared well but needs rested after fired before plated. Hand breaded onion rings to die for. Little bar of fixins. Beef burgers with what tastes like fresh, never frozen beef, well fired on flat iron....would benefit from being chargrilled. Do it yourself sodas. No frills, no waitstaff dining experience - quality of food here betrays the fast food experience. It is a lot like Five Guys food and experience...without the free peanuts, unending fries, and clever diner experience. Come to think of it prices are right in line also. Infact the more I write about both, puts my star rating just above Wendys. Just more expensive."}
{"text":"Not only did they get my order wrong once they got it wrong again when remaking it. I even offered the employee the receipt so that they can make sure they get it correct because it actually was correct on the receipt but he said that he didn't need it. I'm pretty upset because I really like the food but this was a bad experience. Probably not going to come back to this location."}
{"text":"It was my first time at the Habit
Upon walking in, I had to take some time to look at the menu
The girl working the counter was very helpful and funny
I went with the #1 charbroiled burger with fries and a soda
As I was getting my soda, I was so happy to see the little bar for jalapeños, pepperoncinis, and yellow peppers...

When I sat down with my food, I loved how the fries were hot and not salty
They tasted fresh and great with ketchup
The burger itself was very hot and yummy
My meal was very satisfying and I enjoyed The Habit

Service was great, food was great!
I will be back"}
{"text":"Ordered three number one meal including burgers, fries, and drinks. When we picked up from front they only gave us two fries not three. The manager told me my ticket showed only two fries. I told her we ordered three meals what is your problem? After few min she gave me fries no apology. I do not want make complaints because it was my boy's birthday lunch. What a bitch! Go fuck your self and I'm going to report to the company ASAP. FUCK OFF!"}
{"text":"I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth or whatever that saying is. It was PA's turn to pick up the check, so he picked the place and it didn't cost me a dime. Even though I was eating on the cheap, I wasn't entirely impressed with the cuisine. 

I ordered the Santa Barbara, which is a double burger with avocado served on sourdough bread. I opted for fries and got fried green beans as well. Everything was served up in relatively quick fashion and the staff was great, but the food was cold. We arrived about 15 minutes after they opened and I figured the food would be piping hot. I figured wrong. 

It all looked fantastic, especially the tempura battered green beans. The lukewarm (at best) nature of the food put a damper on the meal though. I will give it another shot at some point and update the review as necessary."}
{"text":"Well another new restaurant opening here in paradise valley.....what else is new.....LOL!!! This location is also within walking distance of my apartment. So with that being said the wife and I had to go and check this establishment out for our Friday night date night. This restaurant is located in a newly renovated strip mall that will contain about 4 or 5 stores and when we walked in we were greeted immediately by a nice young lady. She offered us menu even though we had already checked out what was on the menu online. The restaurant was well lit....very clean...and had ample seating. There specialty is char-broiled hamburgers and chicken.....but they also make salads....tuna....malts and milkshakes for a sweet treat. I had the chicken sandwich with grilled onions....lettuce....mayo.....on toasted sourdough bread. I had a pretty good strawberry malt....but that is why I gave this locale 4 stars instead of 5. I have had some pretty good malts in my day and the one I had here was just average. If your going to make Malts they can't taste like ordinary milkshakes. However everything was outstanding including the service but be advised when you order they will give you a pager to let you know when your food is ready. I like this method because you can grab a table while you wait and then when the pager goes off you can go an pick up your order.

Despite the fact that Jersey Mike subs.....chipotle......In and out burger......Mcdonalds.....Longhorn steakhouse.....Arby's.....Wendy's.....Culver's .....and Oregano's are all within walking distance of this locale.....I think it will be able to hold its on. We certainly will see as I plan to visit this locale in the very near future. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Takes awhile to cook, which is okay with me. It makes me feel like they don't have precooked patties for fast service. It's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good burger, onion rings hot and fresh. Chocolate shake very thick and better than in and out.  Friendly staff and comes to your table to check on you and food satisfaction."}
{"text":"I love the food, customer service is great,  however might I suggest the owner turn the air up, it was freezing, customers were eating outside and in their vehicles,  I feel horrible for the staff they looked so uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I'm really picky about customer service and of course, a good burger. I have been to other locations and was excited to find one near my home. They didn't disappoint. Took a little bit to come out, but not any longer than I'd wait at In N Out. Definitely worth it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the burgers and have it on a gluten free bun. Well, that didn't happen. Although the website says that they offer a GF bun, this location does not. When asked why, the staff said \"some just choose not to carry them. Sorry.\" Ok, so I got my burger lettuce wrapped and it was a MESS. Greasy, sloppy, and wet. Bummer.

Aside from not having the GF bun and the lettuce-wrap mess, the burger was incredibly sub par and tasted manufactured. My husband commented that it tasted like a cafeteria burger and he was spot on! We will not be back to eat here. SO SO SO disappointed. Bleh!"}
{"text":"2 stars because the burgers are average (would be 3 stars) but the price for what you get is high (minus 1star).   With that said, I probably should go back just to see. But first impressions are usually what stick."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers for a generic chain joint. Chargrilled and good grilled onions. Fries are pretty good, but inconsistent, sometimes they're good but a lot of times they are overcooked. Always nice and clean inside, with a good condiment station with a few different choices of peppers. Customer service is only alright, but it's mostly teenagers working there so that can be expected."}
{"text":"I work close to the downtown Phoenix location, and have eaten at that Habit quite a bit.  Sorry In-and-Out, Sorry Five Guys...the Habit has you beat!  The tempura green beans with ranch dressing dipping sauce ARE THE BOMB!  The Charburgers taste like they've been artfully grilled over an open fire, which they have.  I am a burger/cheeseburger afficianado, and now when I want a burger, The Habit is my first choice!"}
{"text":"Absolutely no issues. A great burger for very cheap that comes with fries and a drink. I got the classic and it was amazing. I'll definitely suggest this to friends, and come back."}
{"text":"I read somewhere recently that Habit burger grill was the new best burger chain in the United States.  Reading this I had to check it out for my self.  It was a very clean burger spot.  Nice, professional staff.  The burgers were good.  Very much like \"5 Guys\". Not as good as \"In And Out\" but still very good.  Sweet potato fries were excellent.  I will go back soon because as I left I saw they had tempura battered green beans that looked incredible."}
{"text":"I have to say this review is so effortless to write! I heard about this spot from Instagram because I follow YelpLV! I also passed this on the way to work crossing over Blue Diamond on Decatur. First off, the place is super cute and immaculate! I was greeted from the moment I walked in the door and was asked if I was ready to order or if I needed time to look over the menu. I ordered for me and my Mom for a \"to-go\" order and I asked if it was possible to order the burgers with \"raw onion\" instead of cooked and add cheese to another burger and the girl took my specifications without hesitation and read me back my entire order perfectly to ensure that everything was correct and offered a cup for a beverage while I waited! I tried the lemonade while I waited and it just delicious! Once my buzzer went off and my food was ready the gentleman read me back my entire order and made sure it was all correct, offered me ketchup and ranch and even offered to help me carry out everything to my car! The service was incredible and the food was just as amazing, the ranch is just fresh and delicious as well as the meat and produce! I'm so excited to experience a place like this here in Las Vegas and close to home! I hope the food and service continue to remain this consistent! This place is definitely worth giving a try if you're a burger fan! New summer spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is really solid and service is incredible. A well managed restaurant. I will be back multiple times. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was Great! If you like a good quality juicy Burger and crispy french fries you will like this place."}
{"text":"Food is tasty. I recommend the Santa Barbara with bacon. I been here a few times. So far I haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have only been here once. It was decent and clean. I am torn, if I'm going to pay that kind of cash, I want to know their meat is antibiotics and hormone free or at least provide real cheese not made from vegetable oil.

It was packed, no tables left, had to wait...that's ok if food is amazing, I'm willing to. Cashier was a timid mouse who couldn't speak up do we repeatedly had to ask \"what?\"

A good burger doesn't need a bunch of pepper on it...By the simple fact that their only condiments were peppers and citrus fruits, idk...just not sure what I was getting out of the place. I've tried at least 10 better burger places in town including burgR and farmer boys. We will try again in future to see if we enjoy it more...meh!?!"}
{"text":"My kids really wanted to try this place even though we are vegetarians. The grilled cheese sandwiches were chewy bread and cheap cheese. My veggie burger was delicious though (I got it teriyaki style). The staff are really nice, they even offered to bus my tray (antsy kids). The line was not too long, and parking worked out well. I would take some of my meat eating friends there to try it again."}
{"text":"We came here last week to check out all the hype of this place. The customer service was amazing and the food was excellent! We will def be back again :)"}
{"text":"Update: owner clarified hours of operation. Just make sure you go in hour before closing. Good food, better than in and out in my opinion. I love putting avocado on my sandwich it taste great!"}
{"text":"If you ask me, it's the best tasting fast food burger money can buy in Arizona.  I usually get the char burger with swiss and bacon - with extra crispy fries & ranch to dip them in.  You cannot go wrong with this meal, the bun is even toasted.  I work a couple miles away and end up going there at least twice a month.  I don't want to ramble, because it doesn't get much better than five stars."}
{"text":"I saw an ad for The Habit many years ago and I really wanted to try it. A few years ago we were coming back from a weekend in Zion and after having lunch at Chilis, I was disappointed to see \"The Habit\" was located right by the freeway entrance! I had missed my chance to try it out. There are no Habits in the Las Vegas area until now and it's open on Flamingo and Paradise near the Las Vegas Strip. I took Lana there on saturday lunch and there was a tiny line as we walked in. The dining area is a bit small with about 12 small booths and a large, maybe 12 seat long table to sit and eat. There is a small outside dining area but with the Las Vegas heat in full force, no thanks! Prices are not bad and there are several burgers to choose from. I had the regular with no cheese, fries and a drink combo for $7 and change. Lana had the mushroom burger, onion rings and a drink, the total was less than $20, around the $17 dollar mark I think it is. That's very good for being so close to a world famous tourist destination.
When ordering I knew exactly what I wanted, but it's kind of a \"dance\" to order because you can't just speak to the order taker in one quick to the point sentence.
Seems they have questions to ask you and if you just order it kind of messes with their routine. Next time just let them ask you what you want and answer them. If it was a dance, you let them lead. You are the hungry robot, they are the master programer. Kind of like the Soup nazi episode on Seinfeld, let them ask you, then you answer. ha ha!
When you are finished they give you one of those light up joy buzzers when your order is ready. There is some hot yellow chili peppers and drinks on the right. The Strawberry Lemonade with cucumbers was delicious, but you can also get the normal selection of soda's too. There are 2 small booths towards the back, but today I guess they were managers in black shirts and it looked like they had those seats as their office and was doing something on a laptop computer. Maybe that is where they work? I didn't really see a office area for them to use. Kind of odd since there were people looking for a place to sit.
The staff was working hard and I counted 10 people in the grill area and 2 to 3 ladies up front, why they need so many people back there, I don't know but they are were like busy ants doing their best.
Soon the buzzer alerted us and we got our burgers. They were kind of on the small side and from what I remember of the ad I saw many years ago, it seemed the burgers were thicker and larger. First bite and you can tell it's a good burger. I didn't really detected that nice charred taste, but this sure ain't no Mc Doodoos. Very fresh and simple, we liked it alot. The fries are standard and so was the onion rings, both cooked to order and not soggy. Very good.
There was a service lady that came around as we were still eating and she really wanted to take our tray away, but we were not finished yet and I had to tell her we were not done yet. Then when we finished a few minutes later I almost got the trashed dumped into the trash can when the lady came over and she wanted to tip the tray in the rest of the way, so I let her take it from my hands and I thanked her. Overall very good classic burger place, they have salads and chicken sandwichs too, I think. No drive though since they are located in the middle of the building, but they are fast so go in a have a nice burger."}
{"text":"I passed Five Guys, In-N-Out, Carl's Jr, and Sonic to get to The Habit.  It won't happen again. I don't know where all these five stars are coming... but their burger tasted like an unseasoned Sonic burger... and more overpriced than Five Guys. I WILL SAY THAT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT!"}
{"text":"Burger was really Yummy..fries also looked good. Only thing is that it was pretty pricey. I paid almost 6 bucks and got no fries."}
{"text":"First time... big competitor to in and out... and they made reference to it as soon as you step up to the counter...The service was great and the burger was amazing!!! I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was great...restaurant was very clean and new.. will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I love their chicken sandwich!! Everything I've tried is good and super fresh. Theirs salads are huge, good for two in my opinion and also very tasty."}
{"text":"Bomb! Good food, good service, and the strawberry limeade  is on point! And it's definitely a well maintained location, a must try if ur in the market for a market quality burger"}
{"text":"This place is always great, but the cashier Melanie was so outstanding that I felt compelled to give a rating. I got a veggie burger and she asked if I'm vegetarian, and when I said yes, she took steps to make sure nothing touched meat or was grilled on the same surface as meat. So sweet, and so appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place is well worth the money spent. Large portions. Delicious servings.  Healthy options. Reasonable wait times. Favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"This place was so good I can't believe the hype was real! I was so satisfied eating here and honestly I could go back everyday. I had a salad my first time and a chicken sandwich the second time, next time getting the char burger. I can't wait to spend all my money here. I love this place and I'm glad there's one in Reno when I go back for college!"}
{"text":"Hey man, you know I'm really okay
The burger in my belly will tell you same
And when I review
I won't give it crap
Cause The Habit's burger got me smiling and full!

I guess I go to the Habit
And eating away
Gotta go to the Habit
And eating way
Yeah Yeah!
(Lyrics - Offspring - Bad Habit)

The Habit Burger first started out in the beach fronts of Santa Barbara and soon became a popular local burger joint.  I could see why.  Fresh cut vegetables and charbroiled beef patties on an open flame would drive anyone towards this place; I guess you can call it a habit we all have - wink!  

I ordered the Double Charburger, with tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and toasted bun.  Needless to say sounds pretty basic, but once you sink your teeth into the warm bun and through the sides; you can taste the nice thin crust created from the charred grill while the beef has that perfect moisture.  The cheese adds that extra ooze of salt and savory.  Add a side of onion rings or fries and we're golden!  I generally don't rave too much about chain restaurants, but I must approve the Habit Burger for bringing out the \"Bad Habit\" of mines; eating a yummy burger!  Sorry love handles! 

One of the things I noticed about the Habit Burger Grill is their service.  They are on top of it and know how to sell their menu.  You would order like any other fast food joint, but they seem more passionate and knowledgeable of what they do.  I had a few questions on my first visit and they were all answered.  The server and table attendants were super courteous and friendly.  I appreciate good service since it seem like a dying art, but I make sure to point it out when ever I get a chance.

The Habit has a slight beach flare feel, but definitely a modern diner.  Order at the counter and pick a seat, while extra condiments; peppercini peppers, jalapenos, and pickles are readily available at your own risk haha!  I would recommend The Habit Burger Grill to you and see what the people of Santa Barbara of been raving about for years. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We visited The Habit Burger Grill on a Friday night.  After reading Yelps that were ranging from 1 to 5 stars, I had no idea what to expect.  

Parking was very limited and I was lucky to get a spot.  I'm not sure if it's because it's new, or it was Friday at 7pm.  So, in we go and it's pretty darn packed.  I was prepared to wait a lifetime.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  The menu is small, so we decided pretty quickly.

I had a mushroom swiss burger with bacon and my boyfriend had a charburger with cheese.  We also ordered regular fries & sweet potato fries.  We were handed a beeper, and went off to find a place to sit.  We found booth and prepared to wait.  Happily, that was only about 5 minutes.

Our beeper went off and we grabbed the food.  On a tray with the fries in a paper 'boat', our burger was wrapped up with one end sticking out for immediate consumption.  I would have liked a 'double wrap' so that one paper could serve as the 'plate' to hold the burger.  

The burger patties were more substantial that Smash Burger or Five guys, the bun was toasted, and the ingredients were fresh & tasty.  The regular fries were better than the sweet potato fries.  

The food was hot, fresh, and really tasty.  I will absolutely go back & try more."}
{"text":"Updated review; hooked on the teriyaki burger with Swiss cheese. So delicious. So not meh. Currently we've frequented the Habit a couple times a week, I'm happy to report. Trying other things on the menu helped make this place a favorite."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Clean, fast and fresh- perfect. I thought the prices were reasonable also! I had the seasonal feature - guacamole crunch burger and I really loved it. It was different but so delicious!  Yummy! The fries were cooked perfectly for me. Kids had shakes that were very good as well! Good job Habit!"}
{"text":"Not much too say. My visit to the new Habit wasn't much of an experience. The service was okay. Felt a little rushed to order. The burger itself was also just okay. Nothing to gush about. And yeah, just a tad overpriced."}
{"text":"Zero issues. Went in for a quick bite. The place is clean (and new), the service was with a smile, and the charburger with cheese was on point. For fast food, the Habit is a notch above most of the others, dare I say it...even In-N-Out. I was asked a few times how everything was and if I needed anything else, so I'll give this new location the 5-star review they deserve."}
{"text":"It's good and clean but the burgers you could get at Carl's jr they taste the same. Great sides tho."}
{"text":"We live close and have been here a few times.  There are some things I love and some things that I don't.

The tempura green beans are delicious.  Their chocolate shake is so good.

Their burgers are lackluster and not consistent.  I ordered the Santa Barbara once and it was pretty good.  Recently I went through the drive through later and it was a completely different burger.  No avocado and so so so so much mayo.  Like I honestly thought it was a joke there was so much mayo.  It was disgusting.  Also the drive through employee asked if I wanted to donate to charity and I politely declined.  She continued to pressure me and I found that totally off putting.

This isn't the best place and it isn't the worst place.  But I do hope they can at the very least be more consistent and have more quality control."}
{"text":"Restaurant name: The Habit Burger Grill

Judging Criteria:

First appearance: It was presented well, half wrapped in paper. No one topping seemed to overpower another and the patty was the main draw. Upon closer inspection, I could see the bun was stale (the telltale cracked look). Wasn't terrible, but I have seen better. 

Flavor:  Blech. Looks can be deceiving. The patty tasted like it was frozen and processed. It was overly peppery. The topping were fresh but man, was there a lot of mayo. 

Meat to bun ratio: Pretty on point. Everything lasted together until the last bite. The bun to meat ratio was good in terms of both circumference and thickness. 

Included extras (veggies / condiments): American Cheese, tomato, Lettuce, grilled onion, dill pickles, mayonnaise. 

Price: $3.85

Grade: D = Not good. It might be over cooked or the bun is stale. Little to no flavor (or processed flavor). Only eat if in dire straights."}
{"text":"Burgers are becoming a commodity to rank in this town. A good burger isn't difficult to come by but a five star burger experience - I really don't know where to find it. 

We were in a burger mood and didn't want to drive far on a Sunday afternoon. We headed to five guys and, upon pulling into the parking spot, looked at the habit and decided to try something new. When we arrived, I was immediately taken back by the small menu. I prefer options but, hey, sometimes places just stick with what they know and master a small menu. We ordered two double combos and got our drinks. Though it was a slow Sunday afternoon, over half the unoccupied booths and tables were still dirty - and I am not understating the need for a good wipe down on most of them. We found refuge at the only clean tabletop, a high six-seater near the door. I noticed some parties after us come in and just wipe down the least soiled tables themselves.

The food was fine. I liked the fries and the patties were juicy. I wish they had more toppings to choose from. I'd eat it takeout but doubt I'll return to dine in again. I am still searching for a five star burger dining experience and I feel confident I am not going to find it at The Habit."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident because the place I was going to was closed on Sunday so I just ended up driving around trying to find something and alas - The Habit.  I have been here way too many times the past month and have made it a habit.  I get a double char with cheese.  The onions don't leave the nasty after taste in your mouth.  I get onion rings instead of the fries as the fries are not spectacular.  Their onion rings are great though.  They also have a strawberry, lime, cucumber drink that is good.  Usually I don't order a drink from places because I am not big on soda or teas but this is a nice change.  Their milkshakes are nothing special.  Their chocolate sundae is good though and comes with whip cream and nuts.  I would give them a 5 if they had better desert options.  We have been stuck on coming here for the past month.  I am not a big fan of Smashburger, In & Out or Culvers (except their ice cream which is my favorite) and don't understand what the hype is about their burgers but the Habit's burgers are worth eating.  And to top it off - every time we have been there the staff has been great!  Bad thing I found out today though - they don't open until 10:30 am and sometimes we like to eat lunch earlier.  Total for two double char's with cheese, onion rings instead of fires and two drinks comes to $19.00 and some change.  If I get a sundae with it then it is $22.00 and some change - not bad for a meal that is good and I don't have to throw out."}
{"text":"I have been dying for the habit since I heard it was being put in not 3 miles from my house. I first had this delicious burger joint on a trip to salt lake and loved it so much but only had it when I'd go there. I went today to this location and was not disappointed. The service was excellent and the food just as I remembered it. My husband had the Santa Barbara and said it was really good and I had my go to bacon cheeseburger man oh man what I was missing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Another guest noticed the exact same thing but it appears that when the owner or manager of this location is away the staff does play.

The first thing I noticed was that the floors were indeed sticky and it looks like there were footprints coming and going away from the restroom.

Nastiness also included overflowing trash bins in the visible kitchen area and I saw a pimply faced kid (one of the kitchen staff or cooks) throw french fries that were left on a tray on the kitchen floor instead of the trash can.

Also, the staff (since the manager or owner was not there) was chatting up a storm about dating from what I could hear and were not truly paying attention to the customers.

This location was empty when I visited and I see why. Even in the backwards Phoenix area people have standards and going to this location would be a one-time event (with the nastiness and lack of attention to customers from staff)

{"text":"Not too shabby.  Nothing super special but burgers are burger regardless of where you buy them.  We will see if the quality stays the same or if it slumps in future visits."}
{"text":"Decent food, ranch is great for fast food.  Quality is similar to in-n-out.  Most people I know love this place.  It's alright to me."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before. I had a salad that I thought was actually pretty good. Today, I decided that I would order by phone and stop by and get it since I had limited time. It was apparent that you were speaking to a call center somewhere right from the start. Very impersonal. I could barely hear. It was obvious she was using a cheap headset. I was a little surprised that they wanted payment over the phone, and would not allow you to pay in the store. I think that is very poor service. I took my business elsewhere. As a result, I will no longer be eating in this store either. 

A quick look of reviews showed that others have complained about the call center as well. Its your business. Run it how you want. Just know that you are losing business."}
{"text":"Since this review was posted the manager of Habit contacted me. I was mailed a letter and a chance for a do over there. Good news and it's awesome to know our words are read. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time yesterday.  I ordered a vegetarian burger.  It was fantastic.  I opted out of the tomatoes, cucumbers and honey mustard sauce but kept the sprouts and lettuce.  I also added on some grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms and American cheese.  It was beyond amazing!  I was unbelievably surprised.  The Veggie patty wasn't dry or flaky...it was moist and firm just like a true burger patty! 

I will definitely be going back.  Great service.  

Messy outdoor tables...that was the only thing."}
{"text":"First time visiting The Habit Burger Grill and I was pleased with how good the Original Char-Burger w/Cheese tasted.  The fries were very good and now I have another burger joint alternative.

Keep up the good work and I'll see you soon."}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would. My husband and I walked the 30 mins there and back to get dinner and when we get home and start eating notice that both burgers are raw, and I mean RAW!! Then I tried to call and talk to a manager about it but you can't. You get connected to an 800 like number and are told to either go back in or leave a comment to get a call back. Waste of my time and money. I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever! Love this place and I'm not a big burger fan but these are amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for burgers today... and for lunch got a double char burger with cheese  .. and i can definitely say  im satisfied , it was cheesy , grilled onions awesome  , beef patty nicely seasoned over all a good burger... next time i will try the Santa Barbara style"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm missing the hype entirely, but I simply am not convinced that The Habit supposedly has the \"best burger in America,\" as the cashier robotically recited when she asked if I'd been there before. Okay, I thought to myself, challenge accepted -- I'll take the #1 original charburger meal please and my boyfriend will have the teriyaki char.

We were handed a buzzer, filled our drinks, and sat in one of the booths spacious enough to lie down on (think: Yardhouse). Stars for an immaculate dining area! I'll give them that, it's probably the fanciest fast food ambiance aside from the select McD's that have had total renovations. Cool beans. 

So here's my verdict: I still favor In-N-Out and Shake Shack when it comes to burgers. The Habit is not bad, but I wouldn't be excited and pull a u-turn if I drove past one."}
{"text":"The Habit will not become a habit for me. Remember when you where in high school and you had to eat prefab cafeteria burgers? Well, this place reminded me of that. The patty had that:  I've been sitting here already cooked for a while taste. I wanted to like it. I tried to like it.  I didn't like it. :-("}
{"text":"1 stars for one simple reason. They don't care. I order over the phone asked for no mayo. The person on the phone read me my order back which was correct. Also my receipt says no mayo but my burger was loaded with it. Also they weren't warm when we picked them up and they were really greasy. I have had habit burger in north Scottsdale one other time and it was amazing. This one just sucked. I won't be going back.."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but the Albacore Tuna sandwich is the best put together bread and form of protein i have ever had. I only go for that and that only. I want to eat it everyday. Keep it up Habit (thumbs up)."}
{"text":"Habit Burger is a pretty good place if you're in the mood for a burger and want something better than McDonald's but don't want to spend $10 at one of those gourmet places. They fall right in the middle, think In N' Out without the long wait and mediocre fries. What I like best about Habit Burger is that they actually grill their burgers, and because of this they aren't greasy. They also have sweet potato fries and they're delicious. The place is always clean and the staff is courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was great! Drive-thru took a good minute but well worth it!! Would absolutely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Here is the reply I got in private message from idiot on duty manager. They do not like to clean tables or wash their hands. Think they are concerned and will correct their behavior. Wrong! Think again. His reply is as follows. Pray this demented soul seeks medical help for his mental derangement:::

{"text":"Please come to Tucson. ASAP We have In N Out, Five Guys, Freddy's and Smashburger but Tucson NEEDS THE HABIT PLEASE"}
{"text":"Great burgers, that flame is in the meat. Best burger joint in town.
I went there and then ran some errands and hit up the place again on my way home =)"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here. Good food set in a nicely designed restaurant which provides great atmosphere. The burgers are excellent! The fries are good, though perhaps a bit dry for my liking. Price is pretty good for what you get. Overall I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.  The charburger was tasty, their fries are above average and the price is very fair."}
{"text":"This place gets very mixed reviews but let's face it, you can get a burger for $2.95 and they will put all the fixings on for you as well as substitute a wheat bun, no charge. 

They also read your order back to you both when you order it and when you pick it up at the counter. I don't think this is trying to be the best burger place in town, but rather a convenient one without a drive-thru. Plus their bbq sauce, which is kept behind the counter, is excellent. 

Sometimes I just want to get a burger without the fries and drink and cater it my way. Here I pay three and change and I'm out the door. Plus their milk shakes are excellent, food is made to order and not under a lamp and if you stay and eat there, seating is in abundance, there are misters outside and the drink selection is plentiful."}
{"text":"I'm not a fast food afficianado, but it I have to eat it, I'd rather eat In N Out.  It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't anything amazing."}
{"text":"I've been coming to The Habit for a while now and I have to say that the burgers never disappoint me. They are freshly made, juicy, and made to perfection. Other burger places definitely have competition if The Habit keeps the consistency on their food. Personally, I'd have to say that this is one of my top burger choices specifically because the flavors come together very well. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because although they have great burgers, their fries lack any pazazzzzz. They are nothing special and they taste just like all the other fries. If The Habit can create some sort of specialty fries unique to their restaurants, they could end up being more popular than In N Out or any other comparable burger places. This place also has a bunch of great staff members. They are always kind, efficient, and quick in getting the meals to their customers."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite burgers in town. Used to be an in n out fan, but this place has changed me. I love the double char, it tastes like what you'd expect the perfect burger to taste like. Girlfriend loves the portabelo char, but they have a bunch of options so there's no getting bored.

P.s. they have the best chocolate malts I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Well I been looking for a good burger place since I been in Vegas..so I gave The Habit a try...........and I didn't want to leave... I ordered the # 2 half fries half onion rings..the best burger I had in Vegas..5 star place.."}
{"text":"Had the Santa Barbara with all the fixings and a chocolate shake for $9.99.  Not bad and hit the spot. A little pricy but freshly made. Lots of employees and busy place."}
{"text":"salads are iffy. quality of lettuce varies. Burgers are decent but it is almost impossible
to get them to get the order correct. Do you want cheese? no...so the burger has cheese on it. Do you want raw onions? YES, extra please. Nope...no onions. It is annoying. Always the wrong salad dressing as well. kind of noisy."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and salads. Great place for the healthy conscious as well as burger cravers! Vegas soccer cup weekend, players and parents needed a place to eat lunch. Super good and fast, friendly service. Our whole group enjoyed the place. Thanks, Xiaoming."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  In fact, where else in this day and age can you find a grilled Chix salad for $6.99?

Attractive decor, fun ambience.  If only they offered a Turkey Burger...

But I WILL return!"}
{"text":"Been here twice already. The burgers are absolutely delicious and the tempura green beans and onion rings are absolutely to die for. Make sure to get the ranch when you pick up your order and has crushed bacon in it and it's home made."}
{"text":"I have been to this burger joint twice now, once during their soft opening and now a couple of days after their official opening.  Both times they were very busy, but the line up moves very fast and they have a lot of people in their kitchen cooking.  The first time I had their mushroom burger and it was very tasty, juicy and hamburger was cooked just right, with a little bit of pink in the burger. Their fries are also very good, crispy and tasty and you get a pretty good portion for the price.  They also have a freshly made strawberry lime drink that is a must try.  The second time I went I tried just their charburger and it was equally as good.  It comes fully loaded with grilled onions, tomato, lettuce and pickles,  Their prices are very reasonable.  You can get a burger for under $3.50!!  I would definitely go back anytime I need a burger fix."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for late lunch today. My husband really loved the onion rings, thought they were the best he's had for a long time.  The burgers were good - but we both thought they wern't quite as good as In n Out, and they are pricier than In N Out. Next time it will most likely be In N Out."}
{"text":"I tried the albacore tuna burger on wheat bun. Excellent. The fries are big and crispy and the chocolate shake very  chocolatey. Next time I'm getting the onion rings. They have several iced teas all unsweetened that are very tasty as well. I also will try the vegie burger at some point. We still will go to In and Out but the fries are thin and sometimes undercooked and the chocolate shake really not much chocolate flavor. And no onion rings there either."}
{"text":"Just ok. Not gross but not a place I'm dying to return to. Burgers, fries, sweet potato fries, toppings, etc are better across the parking lot at Smashburger. 

The seating situation is really lacking and frustrating. We went with 3 adults and a toddler. Only available tables were outside in 100+ degree heat and it wasn't super crowded inside. We ended up at a high table (not fun with a toddler) and two other couples to listen to our conversation. Again, not horrible but no reasons to go back either."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and fries. My daughter had the veggie burger with grilled onions. I had the burger on sourdough with avocado and it was delicious! Sweet potato fries and onion rings are great. Fresh ingredients and good service."}
{"text":"Im originally for Santa Barbara, so when i heard The Habit was opening over here, i just had to try it. The food is amazing, i got my little fix without having to drive 6 hours. Service is great! I will be a regular, no doubt!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard from several people how good this place was so I had to try it out. Ordered the Santa Barbara Double Char and a mixed order of fries and onion rings. Food came out really fast. Maybe a little to fast. Fries were barely warm, but soggy and limp. Nothing crisp about them. The onion rings on the other hand were very crisp and hot. The batter stuck to the rings. They were very good. The burger was very good although the meat needed some salt and again the toasted sourdough bun was kinda soggy."}
{"text":"In N Out is my go to place on every trip to the west coast. Recently my daughter who lives in Vegas advised me to check this place out. I am glad I did. The burgers are really good and the menu includes sweet potato fries and tempura green beans. Needless to say we ordered both and was glad we did. They don't have a drive through so In N Out is still my place to go while on the run. But Habit Burger is worth a try if you have a little more time on your hands."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here tonight and I was amazed. From what I saw everything was very clean. The young man that was in charge was so nice to his employees. I heard him compliment all of them them on what a good job they did with their tickets. I'm guessing they had just had an evening rush. He was on top of everything and didn't skip a beat. Stocking the to go items up front and tending to customers coming in the store. To me, the way you treat your staff and how the employees feel is more important than how the food is. If the employees are happy your food will always be and the food was good. You don't see that too often anymore, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Habit was doing a free burger event a few days ago to celebrate their opening. Free burgers = I'm in. For what normally will cost you about 8 bucks, you get a good burger (fresh toppings and several different varieties), fries and a drink. That puts this place in the \"gourmet burger\" market, which has some pretty decent contenders around town (Bobby's Burgers, Five Guys, Smash Burger, heck...even In-n-Out). I wouldn't put Habit above any of those i mentioned, but it's was definitely good enough to warrant a repeat trip and to recommend to others. 

Granted it was their opening day, but the energy in this place was high: the people were friendly, the owner was walking around doing table touches and the service was quick. We'll see if that energy dies down when they get to the day-to-day business as usual phase, but as of right now they create a really welcoming atmosphere that makes you want to come back. 

Convenient location too, as you don't have to deal with the strip. Do yourself a favor and resist the temptation of going to Chipotle next door and give this place a try at least once."}
{"text":"Will never eat here again. 1st & last time. Top bun dry cut my ,bottom bun wet like soup. I had a garden burger  and my husband had the BBQ  and is sick after eating it.   were hard like rocks and cold. The fact that I only live 1mile away the should have not been cold and hard. Only reason they got one star was so I could write this review"}
{"text":"Burgers are fantastic and staff is overly polite and helpful.  One of my best places to eat....highly recommend the dining experience.  Tom"}
{"text":"Love it! Bomb cheese burgers and great fries. Love the pepper bar too! Definitely recommend this place for a simple fast food cheese burger."}
{"text":"We thought we would give this place a shot as I have had the burger in CA and was not disappointed. This round not so much. We sat in the drive-through for almost 20 minutes to wait for one burger, one fry and a drink for my son. 

When finally getting to the window I asked what had taken so long and her response was if you want faster service to come inside as it's only a 7 minute wait. Want?? I am not a fast food expert, but I go through the drive through to have quick service and get in and out to move on with my day. Seems very backwards to me. Just think if In and Out had this mentality 

The burger was a slop and the bun was soggy on half of it. Fresh??? Not so much. 

We will not be back to this place when there are so many other options.  Thanks for making it easy"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch today. I recommend signing up for their email newsletter because they send coupons all the time. I redeemed my coupon for a free Charburger with cheese. Unlike some places where you need to print out said coupons, here they can scan them from your phone. 

Everyone was incredibly friendly; I was greeted as soon as I walked in. The service was quick and the food was delicious. I honestly think The Habit is better than In N Out. The fries aren't soggy and the burgers taste way better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a hamburger. The temperature Green bean fries are excellent, I was surprised! I'm glad they're building another one on Craig Road."}
{"text":"First time here, staff was friendly and helpful, food was delicious and I love the pepper bar, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"First let me say that Habit Burger Grill has some of the best burgers I have ever had and their prices are quite reasonable.   That said, this location has terrible customer service.  
I am going to assume that it is just the staff at this location and not emblematic of the chain as a whole. 

My wife and I went recently and I ordered a #2 which by the placard states that it comes with fries and a drink.   I paid the bill and the counter clerk walked away without giving me a drink cup.  I nicely got the attention of a young man named Kirk and told him that I ordered a #2 and that I didn't get my cup.  With no apology he asked to see my receipt and told me that I didn't pay for the #2.  I said, \"no problem.\"   He proceeded to ring in the drink and fries and take payment.    Now, if it were me in that situation I would have given me a cup and a complimentary order of fries but no big deal.  What really miffed me was his attitude.  It was as if I was inconveniencing him.   Completed the transaction and he walked away without handing me a drink cup.  I finally just took one off the stack of cups on my own.    Then after getting the food we wanted a refill on the Strawberry Limeade (which is amazing!) but the dispenser was empty. So my wife asked Kirk if it could be refilled.  He sighed, rolled his eyes and said, \"Give me one moment.\"   The attitude is unnecessary.   

We really like the food here but won't be back with this kind of customer service."}
{"text":"I went to The Habit today for lunch with two other people. I ordered the Albacore tuna filet sandwich on wheat, minus the tartar sauce. The fish was very underwhelming, which is perhaps why it comes with a sweet sauce, such as Teriyaki. There was no indoor seating available due to the slow turnover of tables, and by the time I returned home, the bun was a bit soggy. Even though it was the standard lunch hour at the time of my patronizing the restaurant, I consider it unacceptable for a restaurant of this style to not be able to accommodate its customer volume with seating. Based on my experience today, I will not return to The Habit."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Taste, Great Low Prices.

I have tried:
-Double burger on sour d bread with avocado. True Bliss!!!
-Tuna sandwich, It was delightful..
-Fries not so much
-Onion Rings aaaaa, so-so..

But the main entrees (Burgers & Sandwiches) were off the chart!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I would call it the \"best burger in the nation\"....but it was for sure good.  We went on the preview say and the place was buzzing with employees.  You could tell that the corporate office was there because they were huddled together in the corner giving directions and observing.  My mom and I had the habit cheeseburger and fries.  Everything was good.  I really like their fries.  They were perfectly done with not too much salt, and you get a generous helping.  The food was fresh and the staff was attentive and nice.  
We went back again and found that things were the same.  Employees were attentive and the food was excellent.  I really like that they give you a \"buzzer\" when your order is placed, so that you don't have to lurk around the counter waiting for your order."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night and for less than $10, my Dad and I got a Charburger, Teriyaki Charburger, and Onion Rings. I had the Teriyaki Charburger, which had grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce on it. I ordered it lettuce wrapped and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor. The onion rings were out of this world! They also have a small cold bar near the beverage station that has a few different types of spicy peppers, so I added pickled jalapeños to my burger. It was delicious. It is along the same price range as Five Guys for the burgers, and they also have some additional menu items like chicken sandwiches, an ahi tuna sandwich, salads, etc. Next time I would love to try their tempura fried green beans! Yum."}
{"text":"I love this chain!  Fresh, delicious, fast, affordable.  We get the veggie burger zero/ avocado & grilled mushrooms and it's the best we've had."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times since opening, and I scan not complain. Service has always been great, food is good, and surprisingly quick for just a opening.

Inside seating area is very small. It is odd."}
{"text":"I've been to various Habit's in LA & Orange Counties and even in Las Vegas.  Each time we have enjoyed the food and service.  The burgers are great as are there salads.  I enjoy going there even more then I do the In & Out burgers."}
{"text":"awffffuulll service,there,was one car in front of me, i ordered 2 cheeseburgers,sweet potato fries and it took 19 minutes! no apologies,nothing. I will Never go there again."}
{"text":"I gave this 5 star based on great quality food, price and service. The meat is freshly made to order; price is as cheap as any fast food. The  place is clean with comfy booths. Santa Barbara burger is my favorite. And also the fried beans."}
{"text":"One question I always ask my husband after we try a new eatery is, \" Would you come back?\" His answer was yes to the new Habit burger grill which is located close to our house. We ordered two kids meals the chicken nuggets and the grilled cheese. It came with a gummy candy. Me and my husband ordered cheeseburgers I ordered sweet potatoes fries which were really good. Their quality of food was okay."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! The Teriyaki Char is delicious- not too sweet but just right in my opinion. The real treat here are the tempura green beans- kick the fries' butt any day."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner on a busy Friday evening.  There was a line, but it moved quickly. I ordered a giant Santa Barbara burger with no bun. They were generous with the avocado and the burger was delicious. This was a 3-4 napkin burger.  I didn't try any sides, so I can't comment on those."}
{"text":"We went here after our bar.  We were the only ones in there.  The service was great.  We got the Single burger with cheese, they grill there onions, and it's a really nice size burger.  We got 2 fries, and 2 soda's as well.   I love there condiment bar.  They have Jalapenos, waxed peppers and pepperocini's, I love all 3 peppers.  The burger and the fries were great!  I see us coming here in the future.  Also, 1 fry was enough for the both of us.  And I don't drink that much soda (I drink beer)  lol"}
{"text":"After you've spent time walking around \"The Srip\", this is an Oasis of calm, reasonable people, relaxed atmosphere.

The burgers are really good.  The prices are terrific.  The staff is really engaged.  (I was only able to eat half my sandwich and flying home the next day so I had to toss the rest, I was shocked to see someone express real concern over how I liked the food!)

The place is comfortable, the options are great.  I've been to other \"Habits\" and will continue the practice as they don't let me down.  While I'm really reluctant to give almost any fast food chain 4 stars, I believe this is truly an exceptional place to go when you're looking for a casual dining experience, escape from the crowds on the strip, great prices and good food."}
{"text":"This is a great hamburger joint , can't wait to try their shakes when it gets warmer ."}
{"text":"Stoped here for a quick milkshake after my wings and everything is always everything here. They have good food and milkshakes and the store is always clean and they are fast and efficient . My personal favorites are the Santa Barbara char and the house mad ranch, they do a fantastic job for a chain restaurant, however, be ready to spend $12-$15 for a full meal"}
{"text":"Came here for small dinner/snack. 
I ordered the char burger with cheese and avocado without mayo lettuce wrap style (protein style) just to make myself feel less guilty...
Wow, how did they make this burger so juicy and so char broil flavored!! Simply amazing. 
Inside of my protein style char burger, they put big chunks of avocado, two gigantic slices of fresh tomatoes, nicely grilled onion pieces, salty pickles and a slice of cheese. Very generous with tomato and avocado. (At least a half of a whole avocado) Love it!!
Would've been nice to have with their buns but this satisfied me good enough for today.
Nice that they have three different kinds of unsweetened teas. I like the tropical one.
I think I like it here better than In-N-Out... 
I'll come back to try their tempura green beans!! Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"So this as of right now is going to compete with in and out fully. The meat has its own taste unique to habit but on par with in and out.  Prices are not bad either. The crispy golden chicken was crispy and had a slight spice to it. I suggest no tomato for it though because it does get wet in the hands and can make the bun  soggy. Fries sweet potato   and regular are crispy good."}
{"text":"Love their burgers. I usually cannot find a parking spot here around noon though. The one on Glendale near 7th Street is better for parking."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch for the first time. I was in a hurry but didn't want fast food. The staff was super friendly and helped guide me to order. They give you a buzzer for when your food is ready. Food was fairly quick. 

I got the char-burger with cheese with a side of sweet potato fries. The burger had a ton of flavor and was juicy. The grilled onions were a delicious addition. But the sweet potato fries....... holy moly..... INCREDIBLE! best sweet potato fries I have had. So delicious! 

They also had some good drink options. I got a fresh squeezed strawberry kiwi juice that was very refreshing and tasty. Was a great mix to wash down all the food I shoved down since it was so TASTY! 

Overall everything was super good and I can't wait to come back and take my husband and try more things. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Love habit burger! I normally go to the one in Scottsdale but came into this location today for lunch on a Sunday. Its a small shop and was very busy. You go up to order, get a buzzer, and sit down to wait for your food. God is somewhat quick and comes out hot and fresh. 

I'm currently doing a low carb keto diet so I got a double char burger with cheese, bacon, and Avocado wrapped in lettuce. They need a better way to wrap the lettuce because it was externally messy and falling apart. I asked for a bowl and ate it more like a salad. That being said it was incredible!!! The charburger itself has so much flavor and the bacon was cooked perfect with fresh avocado slices. It was very filling too. 

I didn't get them today but their sweet potato fries are my absolute favorite! Highly recommend!

Everything on the menu looks delicious. I want to come back to try the chicken sandwich or salad. Everything is always tasty when I come to habit!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by the burger patty. I had a mushroom burger with Swiss cheese with a order of tempura green beans with a medium fountain drink. $10+ The burger did not have much taste and the patty was thin. I ordered it well done but it was more medium. The green beans were a welcomed choice over French fries. I liked them but they give you a small cup of ranch to go with them.  I used all the ranch and I still had a few green beans left over. I might try them one more time but so far I can't make it a habit to come back yet."}
{"text":"Best quality for your buck.
Manager went out of his way to show me how the online ordering menu worked."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place. Friendly staff and food is pretty good. Reminds me of Carl's Jr.  There are better burger places, but this is a nice option especially for the location. Worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great value for the price. Excellent customer service. Pretty fast."}
{"text":"The help was rude. The burger had hair in the kids Burger. And the tables were filthy. Will not eat at this location probably any other location for that matter. Also they left my burger sitting on the shelf for more than 3 or 4 minutes before they called me on"}
{"text":"Nothing better than craving a burger and finding a new spot that satisfies! I went her on a recommendation and was very thankful when letting my fellow foodie know I really enjoyed The Habit.
I ordered the double char with fries and a drink. The fries are decent and definitely better than most fast food fries. They do have other side options that others have mentioned, I will be sure to try the onion rings next time. Overall an excellent tasting burger with a grilled bun. I will definitely add this to a must return list of mine."}
{"text":"I have visited here a few times to make sure I had a variety to base my opinion from. From burgers to chicken, fries to onion rings and ice cream. I think the place is a decent option but there are definitely better places for just burgers or chicken sandwiches. I do like the fact they have onion rings on the menu since  a lot of the bigger chains do not. It is a decent fast food place and worth a visit from time to time."}
{"text":"Food was good but the wait time was ridiculous! 30 mins to get two Charburgers. This new restaurant doesn't know how to efficiently run their business. They need to take tips from In n Out. I think I'll going to the Chandler location instead. Didn't have any issues there."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this place but my mom wanted to try it out since it's near her house. I don't know if this makes a difference (which it shouldn't) but we ordered our food from the drive-thru. I was so unimpressed by the food. It seemed to me like a slightly upgraded fast food place. Anyways, my burger was dry and not flavorful at all. Fries were average. Price is whatever, but I would rather get a better burger for about the same price down the street from In-N-Out."}
{"text":"We go here at least twice a month it does not sound like alot but we love to explore new places but love coming back to this place. Love the service and food is great. A plus is the options for kids menu"}
{"text":"Burgers and chicken done right!!   Salads are good sized and the chocolate shake will keep you coming back.  

Can get anything in a lettuce wrap.  Cut the carbs!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Clean, organized, great customer service and the food is great. 
Never disappointed during my visits. The quality of the food is good and the prices very reasonable.  
I love their salads and my husband enjoy the burgers."}
{"text":"For the type of \"fast foodish\" place it is, I really enjoyed it! Burgers and chicken were very fresh and juicy and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"1st time here. ...where do I start:  ordered the Santa Barbara Style as is with fries n an order of onion rings with a coke, my friend ordered a Tri-Tip Steak sandwich No onions or lettuce n water. My friends sandwich came with onions.  They made a new sandwich. While we were waiting for the sandwich a argument between two customers starts....blah blah.  Maybe do to the argument - incorrect order not sure I\"ll go  out of my way to stop in."}
{"text":"Finally something besides M Donald's, Jack, Del, or Taco Smell!!!!!  I was so excited to try this place, we just so happened to walk in on the day they officially opened! The food is so affordable, so tasty, so fresh! And the in house beverage they make is on point!!! I could drink it all day, everyday. We ordered a Tri Tip sandwich sandwich and the Char Burger, both were equally yummy. They offer many condiments plus hot sliced peppers & pepperoncini peppers. I can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"Most friendly restaurant I have been to in a LONG time. Got the double burger and fries. Very juicy and the perfect size. Only downside was I prefer to have my patties cooked more well done. Much to pink. Fries were great, my dad loved the onion rings. Very well priced. I appreciate that for my vegetarian brother, they cook all their veggie patties on a separate flat grill with the buns. I feel like a lot of places don't pay attention to things like that. Lots of choices for non-burgers, Ahi Tuna steak and chicken sandwiches even salads. Great little neighborhood burger joint. Can't wait to come back and try something else"}
{"text":"Just got voted best \"fast food burger\"...beat out In-n-Out and Five Guys.

The double char with the onion rings and a malted coffee shake is my go to combo."}
{"text":"This has to be the best burger place around!  I hate to say it but it even beats In N Out Burger!  The place is clean and the food is fresh.  You have to go try it yourself to see what I'm talking about.  This place has definitely become a \"Habit\" of mine!"}
{"text":"Great fast food burger place. Great service & food.
They offer more than just burgers. They have salads and sandwiches as well. You can customize your burger by adding extra avocados, bacon, cheese, etc as well. Thick patties for the burgers. 

They have unique offerings like teriyaki burger, tempura green beans, sweet potato fries, club sandwich, ahi tuna sandwich, tri-tip salad, fresh juices, and sundaes. 

Recommend the Santa Barbara char, Roasted garlic portabella char, club sandwich, tempura green beans, and salads."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.  The building was very clean.  Ordered the Tri-tip sandwich and tempura green beans.  Both were delicious.  Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Sooooo Yummy! Onions rings are Perfect! Fries are great! I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich but got it the char grilled tariyaki style with extra pineapples! Very delicious! My only mistake was I took it to go and by the time I got home the tariyaki glaze on my chicken made the bottom bun soggy.. Still tastes good! For my drink I tried their strawberry limeade with cucumber and it tastes very refreshing and sweet! 

Have to say in my opinion it's All little pricey for a burger joint but the taste makes up for it! $14.59 for my chicken sandwich fries drink and a side order of onion rings! (I couldn't resist) My service was very friendly as well. 

A must try!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of the Habit Burger chain!!  I know it's a burger place, but I love the grilled chicken salad here!  A must-have at some point.  But it on the list of healthy, inexpensive dining options down the street from the convention center."}
{"text":"Love the pineapple burger and the onion rings rock. It's busy here at lunch and the food was good."}
{"text":"This is not my first time here at \"The Habit\" and definitely not my last. Whenever I want a fresh burger here's where I come. Fresh lettuce, tomato, pickles and everything else that makes a good burger, a good burger. The staff is awesome. I've never had any problems or mix ups in my orders. Depending on my mood and type of burger I'm itching for, this is most likely the spot I'll hit. Wooo!"}
{"text":"This is a fine burger. Looking for a change from in-n-out, or your significant other want to go somewhere else. Look no further than habit burger. A real meaty burger with crisp fries on the side. 

A cut above the standard fast food fare."}
{"text":"Saw this place in the Yelp email.  Needed to take my son to Toys R Us to use a gift card and it occurred to me that Habit Burger was right there, so I suggested we have lunch there rather than the usual McD's.  I temped him with the offer of a chocolate shake.

I was amazed with the cleanliness and brightness of this place.  There was a line when we got there, but it moved quickly.  The tables were packed but we managed to snag a 2-top pretty soon after getting in line.  My son had the kids grilled cheese meal (something you don't find at your standard fast food place) and I had a charburger.  We shared his fries and the shake.

OMG - the burger was heavenly!  The roll gets a little grill to it so it has a little crunch on the inside.  It was not greasy at all, just tasty and soooo good!  The fries were equally ungreasy and good - crunchy too.  The chocolate shake - my son only had about 3 sips which left me to drink the rest of it (dang it) - was absolutely delish.  And the prices were outstanding!

Its a good thing there isn't a Habit Burger closer to my house.  I'd eat there all the time!  Five Guys?  Forget em!!!"}
{"text":"I left In & Out because the line was so big as usual ...down the road I found this new burger place I've never been to... I was surprised their prices were so low, every on the menu was under $7.50...A burger meals include frys and drink.. I got the Santa Barbara Char,  it was a pretty big sandwich.  The food was delicious, good price, friendly staff,   nice place to seat and enjoy a meal... and I almost forgot to say, the menu was pretty big compared to other burger places, like 5 different choices for sides."}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic. Some of their meals include fries and a drink. Would've been 5-stars but the seating is limited on busy nights. Luckily, they do have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My first day of work and I decided to have lunch at a well known destination of mine when I use to live in the area. No better burger joint located outside the PV mall area. Like I have had many of times I could not pass up the mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. The burgers here are definitely fresh and juicy! The fries were crips and not salted which I prefer . The unsweet passion ice tea is hard to find at other eateries. The service is always exceptional and the food comes out within minutes especially when it's lunchtime during work."}
{"text":"The food is great and i appreciate the extended hours. BUT....service needs serious work.

1) Be prepared to wait at least 10-15 minutes, even with no one in line in front of you. If there is a line, that wait time is easily bumped up to 30 mins...at which point you should be sitting down and being waited on IMO. They need to work on this. 
2) Not sure why all the ingredients are being verbally listed out loud by cashiers when it's printed clearly on the menu, but this is slightly annoying. I can read. 
3) IDK what it is with this particular location, but I have yet to receive a correct order. The 5th time it was incorrect I made a complaint. They sent me 3 free char coupons. I gave them another shot. They then messed up the order...which was complimentary...for messing it up the 5 times before. How hard is this?? They always read it back to me correctly but it never ends up this way in the bag. 
3) One time I was asked by the drive-through cashier to park around front and they would bring my food out. Likely to keep their window time low. It was pretty busy to begin with, but with no assigned parking for such instances i had to park pretty far away. Employee came out with my food and couldn't find me. She also couldn't hear me as I yelled across the parking lot so I ended up having to come in anyway. By the time I was helped for the second time 20 mins later, my food was cold. And incorrect.
4) Forget getting resolution by phone. You will need to go back to do this in person or go through the impersonal and automated corporate phone system and receive response by mail. 

Clearly im irritated as im currently waiting for another order to be corrected. Again, the food is good...when timely and correct. But the service is a joke. 

**Manager Sergio just have me my complimentary tickets back to be used again. You get one last shot Habit. Mess up again and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Habit Burger in Utah is far better than in AZ, simple fact is they have Fry Sauce.  Fry Sauce makes all the difference in the world and Habit Burger makes a great Fry Sauce."}
{"text":"I loved the fries and my shake. I have been on a quest to find gourmet fries. While they didn't hit that category, for unseasoned, unenhanced fries, these were really good. I would rate them at the top for simple fries, even above In & Out. 

My strawberry shake was amazing. I could immediately tell that it was real ice cream, and it was thick enough to make it through my entire meal. Next time I want to try a malt.

I tried the strawberry limeade, but after a sip, decided tea was the way to go. The tropical tea had a nice flavor and didn't taste canned, which is a nice bonus.

I do not eat burgers, so I tried a chicken sandwich with the teriyaki and pineapple. They put cheese on despite my not requesting it, but it was 5 p.m. and I didn't want to wait. I didn't like the sauce at all. It tasted more like a barbecue sauce that someone tried to add a hint of teriyaki to. The consistency was like ketchup, rather than a traditional glaze and I didn't even finish half of my sandwich. My daughter hateds cheese on her sandwiches, so I couldn't even bring it to her. The puppies liked their dinner addition.

My husband had a simple cheeseburger and onion rings and he liked them quite a bit. 

We will give them a second chance to let the kids weigh in, and allow me to try another chicken topping. If I only wanted a snack, it would be worth a visit for fries and a shake. Plus, it is right next door to the pet store that allows you to pet the hedgehogs."}
{"text":"The staff is very welcoming when you come into this place. They are patient and enjoy explaining the menu options. 
The food was plenty and fries were shareable. 
Kids meals were a great portion.
We just moved into this neighborhood and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Made my first stop at a Habit Burger Grill today. Here's my review.

The restaurant is a clean and attractive fast food environment.

The menu consists mostly of burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads. They are known for the \"Charburger\". You may order a single or double. Cheese is $0.60 extra. For about $9.75, I ordered a double Charburger with cheese meal which comes with fries and a drink.

Now, I'm not trying to be funny or negative for any reason, but this burger tastes nearly identical to a Big Mac from McDonalds. The only difference is the quality of the ingredients. If the McDonalds Big Mac is \"Grade D\", The Habit Double Charburger with cheese is \"Grade B\". The beef is fatter and more juicy. The sesame seed bun is fatter. The pickle slices are fatter. The onion pieces are larger. Other than that, the remaining contents of this burger is virtually identical to that of a Big Mac which is why they taste the same. It was like a Big Mac that someone put a lot of love and care into but left out the center bread piece.

Now onto the fries. Yes, they too taste just like McDonalds fries except they're fatter and shorter. 

When I was done, I felt like I ate a Big Mac meal on steroids.

The whole experience was fairly similar to McDonalds except the food is better and the restaurant is cleaner. It was almost like they copied the business model for McDonalds but beefed up all the ingredients, added some decent tables and chairs and swept the floor.

Also, just so you know, they offer chicken nuggets on the kids menu with your choice of BBQ, Honey Mustard or Sweet N Sour sauce. Sound familiar? If they offered a yogurt parfait on the desert menu it wouldn't surprise me.

I'd probably go back, but only with friends. By myself I'd pick another place for a cheeseburger and fries."}
{"text":"I am from Santa Barbara and had eaten several times at the original one.  Having been disappointed by some of the other hamburger chains that have come in here in the last few years with much fanfare from people that came from the same towns I was worried that a hamburger from my own home town might be a let down from either a taste or value stand point.  I need not have worried.  I took a friend with me and we each had a mushroom swiss  burger and I had onion rings and she had sweet potato fries.  We both liked the food.  2 burgers, 2 drinks, fries and onion rings were under $19 incl tax.  And being a lovely day we found a spot on the patio and camped out for over an hour.  The staff was friendly and close to being too attentive.  Parking sucks.  Even after the original opening hype they are still packed for a Sunday lunch so they must be doing something right.  I know I will return."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend who had never been to a Habit.  The cashier was quite knowledgeable on the menu and what the differences were between the original store and this one.  We ordered a couple of cheeseburgers and a side of fries and one of onion rings.  The food was great.  We arrived early and by the time we left there was no inside seating left.  They have a large patio but that is not much help on a December evening.  They have enough floor space they could add a couple of small tables or high tops in the center but at peak it might interfere with folks getting to the condiment/soda station"}
{"text":"Really nothing special. I gave 3 stars because the coffee milk shake and tempura green beans were awesome.  Would come back for just those 2 items if I'm not super hungry and just want a snack. The burger though... such a thin piece of meat and not juicy or flavorful at all."}
{"text":"Everything was great. 
From the food to the cleanliness of the place to the people that work there. 
Will definitely be going back! Can't wait to try the chicken sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and place is clean but the food is the definition of average. Fries have no flavor and there are easily better burgers in town. Not a bad experience, just probably will try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"So glad Vegas has a Habit burger now. The prices are reasonable, the burgers are FANTASTIC (and the staff is real careful about allergies for us gluten free folks), fries are yummy (especially the sweet potato fries!) and lots of variety! The service was nice and relatively quick, plus they have a promotion for a free burger if you make a small charitable donation to NoKidHungry. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger joint - try the Santa Barbara style - clean location in Scottsdale close to walKing distance of TPC"}
{"text":"Ok so again I have been hearing all the rave about The Habit Burger, a California burger joint to hit the Valley, was told it is better than IN-N-OUT, man do I love my animal style! Oh anyways back to the Habit,
The joint itself is a cute little place, clean and the staff is friendly, the menu, someone simple, a few burgers to choose from, some sandwiches, fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings and I'm sure I'm missing something but oh well you get the point.
Ok I ordered the Teriyaki Charburger with swiss cheese, I am a huge lover of teriyaki burgers, let's just say I was sadly disappointed. The burger was bland, lacking in flavor, my taste buds were expecting to be hit with the sweet pineapple and tangy sauce, but was left with everything tasting like it was washed in water, the pineapple, grilled onions, tomato, cheese and lettuce just was all mush, so sad.  The sauce was watery and just dripping out of the sandwich, and not watery in a finger lickin good way, like the sauce whatever it was, was watered down to last longer.  
I ordered French fries, which I was told after I ordered I should have ordered the onion rings, but hey fries are fries right?  Sadly no, they were fried good, but lacking in flavor, like maybe The Habit is scared to add salt or even pepper, the hamburger patty could have benefited from a hit a or 2 too! And I don't even like salt or cook with salt.   
But the Onion rings I did try and they are pretty damn sweet, but that's not enough to warrant another trip for me.
I asked for a side of ranch dressing, thinking sweet!! love fries with some ranch, again hit with sadness, the ranch dressing has suffered the same watered down effect and just runs off your fries, didn't even try to stick around :o(
Ok not everything is bad, on their sidebar you can get those hot little yellow peppers , jalapenos, and pepperoncinis, so the side of me that craves the burn of spicy food, got all happy!!! Those little yellow peppers didn't disappoint! 
I really did want to like the Habit Burger, but it just didn't happen.  I do wish Yelp would come out with  1/2 stars cuz then my rating would be a 2  1/2 Stars."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good i havent really tried anything else but their water is good to"}
{"text":"Not impressed, plus I had a hair in my food.  Gross"}
{"text":"The food was good & the burgers were definitely fresh! Although it's a fast food type of restaurant, their service was superb & surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"My review is for the catering services which I had to call a centralize number. I called in an order at 11:10 AM for nine hamburgers nine orders of fries it took me 20 minutes for the person to reply that that was during the rush-hour and they could not process the order it was too large.  They could not work in an order for nine hamburgers to pick up at 11:45?   Could they have not just told me that the first place?  By the time they answered my question I stopped by the store and it was not even extremely busy.  There is a lot of competition in the hamburger market and this customer service was extremely poor."}
{"text":"Love love love the habit. Leaving Vegas just wanted a quick cheap bite before hitting the road, it's far enough from the strip to relax and it's right by a Starbucks. Good and service was great and the strawberry limeade was fresh and Delish!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I stopped in after driving past it the last couple of months since it opened. The burger was delish!  I got onion rings and he got the sweet potato fries. Onion rings were better. This is a nice, clean, upbeat place. Since this place is close to Arrowhead Mall, we will be back!"}
{"text":"We love the burgers here. Double char w/American, grilled jalapeño, hold the tomatoes, lrg fry and a cold coke. Staff is always."}
{"text":"Cool buzzers to let you know when your order is ready.  Also nice seating, lots of booths and a long padded bench right by the register to wait for to go orders.  Much more comfortable than other places.

The burgers are better than In-N-Out in my opinion and are about the same price.  I liked how they chopped the bacon up so you don't eat all of your bacon in one bite accidentally.  Good shakes too.  Had to knock a star because they got my order wrong but we came here twice (on a short trip to Scottsdale, was only in town a couple days).  I wish they had this where I'm from."}
{"text":"This is like any fast food joint.  The food was ok, the place was semi-clean, and service was ok.  I ordered the #2 combo:  cheeseburger, fries, and drink.  The cheeseburger and fries was ok."}
{"text":"Was so hungry didn't know what to get until I pass by and felt like a burger. I ordered the one patty burger with cheese and fries with a drink. They give you a buzzer you go sit and wait and they'll buzz you and your pick up your order and you just take off from there. The food was pretty tasty and still fresh by time I got to my office."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place out and it was pretty good. I ordered the char burger with no onions, tomatoes, or pickles, a side of fries and a strawberry shake. It's such a cute little place to have lunch."}
{"text":"great food!!!
new, clean restaurant
friendly enough staff
all u can drink bomb strawberry limeade . . all at great prices!!! 

we were thouroughly satisfied on our 1st visit to Habit - will def be returning!!!"}
{"text":"I really really like this place!

Been bypassing In and Out on Blue Diamond to head here. Their teri burger is my favorite for its pina, fresh burger patty, and grilled sesame seed buns. I always ask for a side of BBQ sauce to dip my burger into.

They have to have the BEST onion rings at a fast food burger joint. They're perfectly brown, crisp, and HUGE! They have to use the largest of onions. 
Their tempura string beans are, also, a must have. Make you feel like you're \"eating healthy\" lol

Not only are their burger and fries bomb, I'm really enjoying their salads, too.

Do not sleep on their BBQ chicken salad. It's extra yum. I think their ranch dressing is my favorite cuz it's not sweet ranch. Goes so well with the BBQ!"}
{"text":"The Habit is our new, neighborhood burger joint.  They serve up a tasty enough burger... $7.05 for their single burger meal with cheese, after taxes.  It's good but nothing that stuck in my memory so much that I'd be rushing back.  I'd stop in but not make it an effort.  

The best thing here is the friendly staff and cool interior.  It'd be a good joint for a 4th or 5th date. haha

Might see ya there!"}
{"text":"I'm not a burger lover and I have not tried one here.  However, I LOVE the tri-tip sandwich with grilled onions and no sauce.  I had it 3 times and enjoyed it.  This last time I got a lot of gristle so I had to take the meat out to eat around it. 

My husband was picking up lunch for me and after the gristle issue wasn't in the mood so I got the cesar salad with tri-tip added.  Wow, I really liked it and the meat was plentiful and tender.  A few cents more than the sandwich but worth it.

We love to order online - easy to customize the order and then stop in and pick it up...otherwise parking can be a nightmare."}
{"text":"I received an email from The Habit Burger Grill for a free Charbroiled American Cheese Burger. My husband and I stopped in to use the coupon today after his doctor's appointment.
In addition we ordered French fries and a small drink which I chose to try their tropical ice tea.
The Burger was fresh, hot, grilled to perfection and delicious. The French fries were hot, crispy and tasty. The tropical ice tea was refreshing and I put a slice of lemon in it as well as sugar because it's unsweetened.
The employees are friendly, welcoming us as we entered the building. They are helpful and attentive. The restaurant was clean and tidy. I could tell they care about their customers and their job; this is a sign of good management.
We will return in the future as I like The Habit Burger Grill over some of the other competitors out there. Overall their prices are reasonable and comparable to other burger restaurants in the valley of the sun."}
{"text":"I come from Santa Barbara, home of the original Habit and this is jut as good. So excited to have it close to me. They have taken to stopping by the tables to ask if you need drink refills and opening doors. Friendly faces top quality food. Where I chose To go for my birthday. Love it!"}
{"text":"Omg! So good! So fresh! Great burger joint. Ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich with grilled onions. The steak was tender and perfectly pink. Husband ordered the Original with fries. The burger was juicy and a good size. The fries were perfectly seasoned and fresh. We split a drink. Total bill was a bit over $14. Not a bad dinner price. Place was empty when we got here at 9:00 on a Saturday night but quickly filled up. Great service and great food. We will make The Habit a habit!"}
{"text":"Best fast food burger I've ever had. You can't beat the price and the fries are great to. My son loves it... I love it... I highly recommend."}
{"text":"the burgers from this place is tasteless and also the citrus tea is like drinking water thats it . did not like the food we got from here."}
{"text":"Something incredible happened here tonight that I had to come home and write about it. 

I was starving after a 4 hour meeting and decided to stop here for a quick bite of burger. 

They close at 10pm, I showed up at 9:50pm, not really sure if I would receive service or be told that the kitchen closed at 9:30pm. 

Sure enough, I walked in and they are already cleaning the kitchen. Chef Ramsey would have been proud. The 2 workers there had the units pulled away from the wall and was really wiping down the wall behind the kitchen equipment. I was really impressed by how hard and thorough they were working. 

The icing on the cake though, was the friendliness of the cashier. She had a big smile on her face to welcome me and when I asked if the kitchen was closed, she said no, I can order anything I wanted. 

Seeing that the fryer was already turned off, I ordered just a charburger. Then I watched as the worker cooked up my burger on the already cleaned griddle. This whole time, everyone was super friendly like I has not just caused double work for the workers because after cooking my burger, they will have to clean the girdle again. 

And the cashier asked me at least 3 times if I wanted to order anything else. 

I was really floored by how hard these guys worked and how nice they were to me. 

If you are the manager or owner reading this review, you should really give these 3 incredibly hard working and incredibly nice ladies a raise. 

Their work ethic and costumer service skills were impressive and made me feel really welcomed that I would come back . . . Oh, and the burger was really good and hit the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Similar to Smashburger. This place has a little better burger and the tri-tip sandwich was pretty good."}
{"text":"I think there's too many burger joints around.  Stopped here to see if anything stood out.  Clean place friendly staff,  not much of anything stood out flavor wise though.  Big difference is they use Caramelized onions instead of regular, great on a patty melt boy no biggie on a burger.    Smash and Delux are tied for my number 1 joints."}
{"text":"Wanted to go to another restaurant, took a wrong turn and ended up at Habit. Hesitant to trying new food because I mostly end up disappointed when I get out my comfort zone when it comes to that. However Habit surprised me with awesome burgers and a great deal! Had the double char cheeseburger. Definitely recommend and will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This place is originally from Santa Barbara County, city of Goleta! I've been eating at The Habit since I was a little girl, I'm so excited to find there's a few here in AZ"}
{"text":"Concept resides squarely between In-n-Out and Five Guys.  Good fast-food burger, but not much more.  Can't compete with Delux, Zinburger & The Grind, but it's cheaper & faster.  Upsides vs. In-n-Out are topping variety (mmm, bacon & BBQ sauce), superior side options (sweet potato fries and onion rings) and char-broiling vs. flat-top grill.  A bit pricier, though.  Nice for a change of pace, perhaps."}
{"text":"OPEN LATE: Which of course is the best thing about this place. I had a double chat burger with fries and onion rings. Pretty tasty but your typical fast food burger. Kind of pricy too. Staff was polite and worked quick even though I'm sure they were tired since it was already 10pm. Good place if you need a late night meal and don't want mcdonalds."}
{"text":"They had finished this a couple months ago and I had never been there before. Unfortunately I had confused this place with Rehab burger so I was disappointed when I had realized my mistake. Needless to say it was ok. Not bad but not great."}
{"text":"It was just ok the service was great but I'd rather eat a veggie burger from fatburgers"}
{"text":"A new favorite burger spot! I possibly like it even better than In N Out. I ordered the teriyaki charburger, which was very good. The service was great. The place was nice, neat, and clean. Recommended!"}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying the prices are decent enough to make me want to come back for sure.  The fact that their fries are completely revolting makes me not want to return.  Anyone who likes those fries has no real taste buds.  Bland as hell. If i am wanting more salt(which never tends to happen) or a type of dipping sauce...Houston we have a problem!!!

Burgers.....ehhh....okay. Nothing special. IMO  is it worth getting again? Maybe.

Mocha Malt Milk shake? HOLY MOLY DONUTS!!! AMAZINGNESS IN MY STOMACH.
Definitely worth driving back for but in different flavors for sure. HAVE to try them all!
OM NOM NOM!

Habit Grill please do not dissapoint me anymore....please and thank you :)"}
{"text":"We all loved our food.  Hatch burgers were not too spicy, and the albacore sandwich was delicious.  The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very attentive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are always on point but on my last visit I was dieting so I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and I can't believe I'm going to say this but it was better than their burgers. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Super CLEAN! Very friendly and well groomed staff. Sometimes that makes a big difference in your experience.  My chocolate malt was really malty and super good, and the fries and rings are excellent.  Even better, you can get a 1/2 order fries/rings! BONUS!!!! Nice touch at the condiment station with the peppers too! Staff very attentive and helpful and also friendly.  Will go back based on that more so than the food, which was very good by the way! The caramelized onions on the burger was a great addition too. Be sure to check your order when you receive it though.  The cashiers ask all the questions and repeat your order back to you, and repeat it again when they give you your order, HOWEVER, I've been 3 times since this review was first posted.  Now I feel I must edit to let you know that:
1/ The first time, I ordered a Teriyaki char and received no such teriyaki. I had to get up and go ask for Teriyaki sauce.
2/ The second time, I ordered the same thing and wanted a DOUBLE Teriyaki Char.  NO DOUBLE RECEIVED. Only a single burger, but still good.
3/ Ordered a double Teri Char again, with only mayo, cheese, pickles and onion. Had to repeat the order 3 times and still got the wrong order, only this time, they just added pineapple which I hate. Aside from the fact that the order takers ask all kinds of questions and repeat the order 2 times afterwards, its seems that the people they transmit the order to do not get it.  This is why I will hesitate before going back because I usually only give something 3 tries before striking out.  If you like to just order it with everything and then just scrape off the stuff you don't like, then perhaps this is the place just for you."}
{"text":"Dieser Habit Burger Grill scheint noch recht neu in de Fashion Show Mall in Vegas zu sein. Er befindet sich im Food Court im 3. Obergeschoss.

Der Service hier ist sehr freundlich und zugewandt und frag schnell alle Wünsche ab.
Zu empfehlen ist hier definitiv der Double Char Burger, der bei jeder Bestellung frisch zubereitet wird. Somit bekommt man immer einen extrem frischen und heißen Burger, der nicht abgestanden aus dem Regal geholt wird.
Toll bei den Burger sind auch die geschmorten Zwiebeln, die anstelle der normalen rohen Zwiebeln serviert werden.

Darüber hinaus gibt es noch Auswahl an kostenfreien Chilis in Jalapenos, die man sich zu seinem Burger nehmen kann.

Ein Getränk kostet in der normalen Größe 2 Dollar und gibt es mit Refill. Tipp: Der frisch gebrütete Eistee schmeckt gut. 

Der Double Burger kostet 4,65 Dollar und ist eine gute Portion zum satt werden.

Unbedingt einmal testen, wenn man in der Nähe ist!"}
{"text":"It's always hard to decide what to have for lunch at the office. We have some non-meat eaters, and it being a family business we all want to eat lunch together at once.

I'm from cali so I'm familiar with the habit. We ordered it for lunch once and everyone loved it.

It's a little of a drive for us, but so worth. I was annoyed that I had to pay with CC over the phone if placing a to-go order. (which is understandable, but inconvenient when ordering for 10+)

So, I decided to just go order in person and wait.

I get there and everyone is great. order by 5 albacore sandwiches, a tri -tip and a salad plus the numerous sides. 

Service was great! they were so quick and not only quick but ACCURATE which is a huge plus!! I hate ordering food, then realizing someones order is incorrect once I get to the office.

overall: Albacore tuna is out of this world.

and I'm extremely impressed with their customer service. We wil def return!"}
{"text":"There food tast like Burger King I though it would have tasted like a burger joint not normal fast food. A little disappointed"}
{"text":"Super clean place, fast and friendly service and last but definitely not least the food (I had the tri tip) was delicious.  I will be eating here 3-4 times a week I'm sure."}
{"text":"As an employee at In-N-Out, I thought that nothing would compare to my usually Double-Double. However, Habit Burger has changed the game. When I first walked in, I noticed that the restaurant was very open so I could see everything going on in the back. The onion rings were fantastic, and the bacon on the BBQ Bacon Char Burger was extraordinary. Another positive for me was the great music choice. I don't know what station it was but they were playing great throwbacks. Overall, it was a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"The restaurant- clean, comfortable modern...
The Burger  - it's good. It could use more seasoning. It's about on the level of In-N-Out and Five Fuys...the meat was fresh the buns toasted. I like have sweet potato and onion ring options. Made to order and quality...but not gourmet.
4 stars."}
{"text":"Love love love this burger place!!! I'm not really a big fan of burger and I've never ever finished a full burger no matter how small! But when my friends and I went to Habit burger for the first time? I actually finished a whole burger and sweet potato fries lol, they couldn't believe it  and they had to take a video of me eating it all just to be sure it wasn't a dream lol. Silly guys. Overall it's a great burger place and the staffs were very nice! Been back there a few times and I'm still satisfied."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food but calling ahead is a joke, puts you on hold seems like forever. For those who need to be in and out try somewhere else.   Great grilled chicken sandwich and fries are good too. Very nice employees."}
{"text":"Had the burger on sour dough with avocado amazing.  Best burger I've had in a long time.  Sweet Potato fries yummy.  Can't wait to go again with my family."}
{"text":"Honestly having read the reviews, I think the Habit here has a tough time keeping its fans happy.  But compared to other burgers their food is well priced for the quality.  The wait is a bit longer than some \"fast food\" places but we have never gotten burgers really any better, and the prices compare to places much worse."}
{"text":"After seeing these pop up around town .. We decided to check it out..I originally thought this was more of a gourmet burger place but is basically a fast food joint.. More like In-n-Out Burger. I got the double char with Swiss and it was good and fresh tasting and the onion rings were good also. Friendly staff and bright clean space although it was sad to see it was the old My Florist Cafe which was a great place.. At least they are keeping the sign up. All in all a good place to grab a burger."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time tonight. Burger was poked perfectly and just the right balance of all ingredients. Found my new burger place!"}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese ever! I work right next to this place and go here all the times I have a salad last time that was so big I never got to finish during my lunch break! They greet you with a warm welcome every time you open the door! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here with high expectations, and I have to say they were met! The menu is relatively basic, but everything's high quality for the very affordable price.  A MUCH better option than fast food (which I hate!) for around the same budget. They have coffee and mocha shakes that I really want to try - my friend had one a different time and said the shakes were good.

Burger patty wasn't too big, but it was tasty. Buns are toasted really nicely so that they crunch in an awesome way. I had the Teriyaki Char (teriyaki sauce and a pineapple ring on top! Plus the other fixings) because it was something that looked kind of original and different. SO GOOD! I wasn't expecting it to be as tasty as it was but I loved it. I do want to try their veggie burger as well.

If you're not too into burgers, don't fear! They do have other sandwiches and salads. I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"The original double char combo was great. The service was fast and friendly. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Friends told me that Habit Grill was awesome. 
Habit Grill is good. But I left feeling ho-hum about them. I ate a bbq hamburger and barely tasted the bbq sauce. I could see it but the taste was ho-hum for me.

My wife had a cobb salad and the portion size was very impressive. The egg wasn't as dominant a taste as she expected. And she liked that.

Well probably go again, but we need something to jump and make us want to return. There are many places in Las Vegas serving hamburgers. Some are closer to home too. Give us a reason to make you habit forming."}
{"text":"Habit burger is decent, but doesn't stand out enough when compared to other similar burger chains in my opinion.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but I'd probably choose it over most of the major fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was good as usual. I witnessed 2 positive incidents. 1. A couple with a little girl toddler were so busy taking care of the child, they left without their food. One of the employees  personally chased the young parents down and gave them their food in the parking lot. 2. An elderly couple were sitting at their table and when their food was ready, the manager personally brought out their food and helped them with drinks, napkins and condiments. Awesome service. Will return."}
{"text":"Imma give it two stars and the two stars are for the great service and my soda. The burger & fries were dry, bland & not seasoned at all! I put salt on the fries-still dry, mustard on burger-still dry, got ranch to dip fries-still no taste! Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Hit up this place with some coworkers since it was relatively close. Had the Chicken Sandwich and onion rings. 

Was not really impressed with the sandwich. The Chicken was dry but at least the ingredients tasted fresh. 

The onion rings were good, but not anything too special. My ending bill without having soda or a shake was around 9 bucks. For the price it was a decent meal but I probably wouldn't come back to this place. Smashburger is definitely a better choice and around the same price."}
{"text":"Tonight was a decision between Smashburger and Habit Burger. Never had Habit Burger but I figured I'd give it a try since I've never seen one before. 

The Santa Barbara was awesome. If that's all I'd ordered, I'd probably give this place 5 stars. Unfortunately I also ordered a regular Charburger with cheese and sweet potato fries. I hate that plastic imitation American cheese so I asked for Swiss. Of course it still came with American. Strike one. The sweet potato fries might have been good but were as cold as if they were 3 hours old. Strike two. The awesome Santa Barbara is the only reason this place even gets 2 stars.

Thanks for making me waste $7 on inedible food Habit Grill."}
{"text":"When I'm at work and I want a burger for lunch, the Habit is in my heavy rotation because it's 5 minutes away and it's really good. Less than $7 for lunch that's freshly made and delicious in this part of N. Central PHX is a win and you won't need to tip anyone or wait long to eat.

Is there a friendlier staff? Hard to find one. The dining room, the soda and drinks and the condiment area are always clean. Sometimes the tables could use more frequent cleanup and I've been here twice where someone has dropped a heinous deuce in the bathroom that the ventilation couldn't handle. It emanated into the dining room so I moved outside. 

I think the burgers are some of the tastiest around and the fries are pretty damn good, too. I need to venture off of just burgers because the menu definitely offers more, but I love the char-burger so I can't quit it just yet.

Yeah, if management reads this...do something about the crapper, definitely. Bigger & badder exhaust fan or something."}
{"text":"My \"double char\" was really good, but I did order it without grilled onions. We had a pager to call us to pick up the order and it was ready quickly for the number of orders going in. 
The Mushroom burger for MyLove was enjoyed thoroughly by her, but it was a sloppy mess by the end.
We dined alfresco."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  I think it was good because we were hungry.  Would maybe go back in a pinch.  Nothing specific makes me think this.  Just didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"I was surprised. Very clean, very fast, very fresh tasting food. I got the grilled chicken sandwich on wheat bun, swiss cheese, tomato and light bbq sauce, and green salad to go with for about $10. Score for the deal. Sandwich was good size and very flavorful. The salad was decent sized as well, almost chopped, which I kinda liked, I hate big leaf lettuce salads that flap dressing all over your face and clothes. Small cut lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers and croutons. Not a bad deal. Next time I'll try a burger. The people I was with all said the burgers were good too."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Food was great. I've visited a lot of Habit locations and this was the friendliest. Everyone had a smile. I wish this location was the one closest to my house."}
{"text":"In the hyped world of burger mania, it seems the concept is more important than the flavor. Given the name Habit Burger, I had high hopes that it would indeed become a habit. Maybe they are having some start up issues which explains the luke warm fries. The burger, however, is anything but habit forming. The beef was tasteless and didn't have a chance against the strange sauce that oozed from my sandwich. The lettuce was shredded to a point where I thought maybe it was meant as food for small reptiles. I'm sure some folks will make it a Habit. For me taste is most important which is why I will cross over the freeway and hit 5 Guys. Better burgers and better fries period."}
{"text":"Good food, healthier options if you prefer, and service is friendly!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews for the Habit Burger Grill and was excited to try.  Took a quick cab ride over with my mouth watering.  The experience was good.  It's interesting as other reviews have commented about the service.  

For us, the service was a little lackluster. It's funny as you order from the counter and go and pick up your order.  

I had the double charburger with fries and a drink.  The fries were some of the best that I have ever had.  The burger was good but didn't blow me away.  

Should have snapped a quick pic but I was really hungry."}
{"text":"Great burger. Great fries. And always a clean place to eat at. Affordable for all and even have salads if needed. Cone Ice cream for the little ones and wouldn't like any other burger at this point."}
{"text":"I came here before and ordered take away and was less than thrilled with the food even though we ate it relatively quickly after ordering.. i signed up for their burger club for a freebie for another visit and used it today. Way better flavor in the food, although I'm weird about my burgers being well done, they were still tasty not amazing but tasty. Onion rings were crispy and warm, mom said her fries were alright and her burger had a good amount of flavor.. they have a small hot pepper bar which is good, and a variety of teas and this cucumber strawberry drink which looked appetizing but I didn't try it.. I won't go out of my way to come here but now I know what to expect. The customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"Burgers are my favorite, just not from here. Burger was greasy all around the patty, yet the meat itself was dry. So either they keep pressing it with the spatula or they took an old patty and greased it to make it \"fresh\". I was let down."}
{"text":"Love this place! My friend took me here once and recommended the double charburger, comes with fries and a drink! Food is always fresh and the service is great."}
{"text":"I usually have a decent experience with my food order from The Habit. Today was not a good day. My grilled onions were disgusting, bitter and charred. I scooped out the onions and still ate my burger. Feeling gross now. 

I'm giving a three to offset the good days with this one horrible experience"}
{"text":"One of the best and most affordable Veggie burgers ever, in a proper dine-in kinda restaurant!!! $5 burger, $2 fries and $2 for drinks makes this place extremely inexpensive. The burgers are served like a Gourmet Restaurant! Ofcourse they don't have as many choices of sauces, but it's great for the price! My most favorite part was the Pepper Bar ... u can choose to complement your meal with Jalapeños and Banana Peppers for no extra cost. Felt like a $$ food and service for an actual $ price! Service is efficient and quick. Will surely be making it a regular."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait, placed an order in the drive thru, waited 15 minutes to get to the window with only 2 other cars in line, placed an order for a #2 combo mi us pickles , what i received was 2 hamburger with everything and no fries.i am allergic to pickles, so i threw both of them away. i got a $10 lemonade. not the first time this has happened,  but it will be the last for me."}
{"text":"I came here February 11, 2017 approximately 8pm-8:30pm. This will be a little rant starting but it will make sense.

After long days of military training and my wife ill from her pregnancy, she was looking forward for me to get home to cook dinner for us. Being exhausted, I definitely wasn't in the mood to cook so I decided to pick up dinner at The Habit Burger Grill on my way home. Usually I avoid going to restaurants in uniform but due to the circumstances of being exhausted and having a pregnant wife. I was going to take the 10 minutes to pick up dinner in uniform.

I have been serving for 6 1/2 years now and there has been a lot of changes since the day I enlisted and it's been frustrating. Somedays I ask myself \"why the hell am I doing this....\".

The manager at this location came up to me shook my hand and said \"Thank you for your service\". This is a common phrase that most service members hear from civilians which we all appreciate the support but one thing that was different for this individual (the manager) who thanked me was that he said he appreciated everything I do and sacrifices I have made for everyone and his family. It made me rethink why I was serving.

Anyways, the food I got here was delicious. The customer service I received here was excellent and the restaurant itself was clean and a welcoming environment. I like the burgers here because the meat is actually real and cooked when you order it. 

I really like the location of this restaurant too. There are multiple selections of restaurants around so if you go with your friends, there is a variety of choices for everyone. Keep in mind this is a hot spot location where a lot of people go to and it will be packed during lunch time hours because you have Costco Wholesale, The Gilbert Temple, San Tan Mall, and a high school not too far away."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a line when we went in, which shows how popular this location is considering it was 2:00 p.m. on a Sunday.  The line moved quickly though and we found a table outside to our liking.  You are handed a buzzer that goes off when your food is ready to be picked up at the counter.  It only took about 5 minutes for our buzzer to go off for food pick up.

I had the teriyaki char burger with cheese and he had a regular char burger with cheese.  There were a TON of toppings on both of our burgers - lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles - plus mine had the teriyaki sauce and a grilled pineapple.  It felt like too much for me, but it was nice for him, so totally a matter of taste!  

I didn't love the teriyaki char that I ordered.  The pineapple actually had very little flavor, which was a touch odd.  The fries were good though.  I scraped most of the toppings off since the burger itself was on the smallish side, so the toppings to meat ratio was off.  

Overall: B-
Next go around I'll try the standard burger with cheese added!"}
{"text":"My bosses come here all time and love it. I finnally got a chance to come by and try. Great burger. Friendly staff and they are quick service for a week day lunch!"}
{"text":"First time here and I love the burger it's moist and the garlic fries are amazing! The people are friendly and they have efficient service."}
{"text":"Delicious doesn't even begin to describe this place. Love how they have the pepper bar. The onion rings are on point. My fiancé, my daughter, and I love this place. Hopefully when more people find out about it, they still remain authentic and don't raise their prices."}
{"text":"First time here! They're delicious. We all got burgers... hubby got the Santa Barbara, I got the double char, son got the cheeseburger kids meal and we all equally enjoyed our food. The kids burger is the same size as the adult one, which is a plus! All of our burgers came out HOT (yay!). The tempura green beans are also delicious and amazing. They taste like fresh green beans, which is great, if you're into that. Now I'm waiting for the wee ones to finish their meals all while contemplating a malt... I'll update my review if I decide I have room to try one. XD

Service was prompt and friendly. And the server comes by asking to take our tray when we're done eating, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Simply amazing this place is great. Especially if you're Vegan/Vegetarian. The atmosphere is very friendly and it's at a nice location. And don't get me started on the employee's they're superb. Miss Ely is wonderful one of the coolest General Managers I've ever met. Also if you ever meet Gaby, she is exceptional and has the best customer service. Other than that I hope you guys have a great day."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger. This place keeps it simple and makes excellent burgers, which are worth the modest price ($10.70 for a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a drink). Unlike a lot of burger joints that try to reinvent the wheel, these folks just stick to the essentials, and the end product is awesome food at an awesome price. 

The only things I could want to see is some kind of breakfast option, maybe a sunrise burger, and also have the option to have burgers on those delicious looking rolls they use for the grilled sandwiches. 

Vegetarians: there is a vegetarian salad and a veggie burger on the menu. I was told that the veggie burger *is* cooked on a separate grill surface."}
{"text":"Got a double with American cheese and fries. 
The fries were just ok, and the burger was filling and tasted ok. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"So impressed first time here ! Wasn't expensive great quality food . So impressed with the manager and how he engaged with the customers . The staff was so nice and made sure I had everything I needed !!! Definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"This place was really good was surprised because I heard a lot about it I need to to try more items though on the menu... but the time I went they were pretty busy so you may expect some wait times."}
{"text":"Here's what I love about Habit Burger:
1. Can order and pay online
2. No problems getting custom designed meal. Lettuce wrap instead of bun- absolutely! 
3. Nice shop and employees. 
4. Fair prices for quality food.
6. Convenient location. 
7. Fresh ingredients combined in a delicious way.


My favorites: mushroom swiss burger in lettuce wrap plus bacon! Cobb salad is big and fresh. You can eat at least kind of paleo-style at this place without much effort. I've eaten there many times and never feel lousy afterward when I choose carefully!"}
{"text":"To be honest with you, In-Out, Farmer Boys or Habit, I'd go to the Habit....Those fried green beans are out of this world. The Burger is fresh and the price was very fair....Top of my list, although I can't complain about FB's Avocado Burger and there Fried Zucchini dipped in Ranch Dressing...."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this location. The lady who helped us was very professional and nice. The food tasted great!  I wanted my patty well done,  with no mayo. I got it the way I wanted it! I definitely reccomend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is my latest Yelp review where I'm truly stuck between 3-4 stars and wish we could go halves like the overall average does.

So, my 3 1/2 star experience here featured a high level of customer service, even though it was very obvious that the female employee actually taking my order was a new employee. Another employee looked over her shoulder to make sure she entered the details of my order properly and that particular employee answered every question I had with enthusiasm for my business.

The Teriyaki Charburger was a good choice, especially since I left off the mayo because I don't know why anyone would want to mix mayonnaise with Teriyaki sauce. Unless it is mustard and ketchup, makes no sense for me to mix condiment sauces on any sandwich. Pick one for that particular flavor and enjoy it, don't create condiment chaos that overwhelms the ingredients. 

That Teriyaki burger was better than I hoped and a really good value for the price. Feel free to take my lead and order yours also with sourdough instead of the toasted bun for no upcharge.

I also had a garden salad with tri-tip steak added to it and while I also thought it was a good value, I have to agree with others that the salad is just kind of average in taste and nothing special. The value came in the size of the salad and the amount of steak they added for the additional charge, but I didn't even finish the salad portion despite trying three different dressings at a time to add some flavor to the veggies.

This space is very clean and convenient for those like me who stay just off The Strip and sometimes just want to grab and go dinner from a place a step up from fast food, yet not wait at a bar for takeout at a casual dining restaurant. 

Besides, after a long flight into Vegas and all the additional time required to get off the plane, pick up my golf clubs at baggage claim, ride the shuttle to the rental car center, pick up the actual rental car itself and drive to my hotel, this Habit is right on the way to Westgate and feeds me quickly without any hassles of The Strip itself."}
{"text":"Great burgers & fries. The staff seems friendly and the place looks clean. Haven't tried anything else other than the regular burger and my daughter got the kids chicken nuggets which she loved. 

TIP - Don't order online... seems like they don't finish your order until you get there anyways. Just don't go when its packed and the food won't take long to make if you are picking it up to go."}
{"text":"Double Char Burger with cheese was very good.  The burger was juicy and the produce fresh.  It had a great taste.  The fries were simply average, but I also got some onion rings and they were fantastic.  Too much food, obviously, but I wanted to try them both.  Next time I'll go with the burger and onion rings.  Prices are reasonable for what you'd expect at a fast casual type of place.

Staff was friendly.  Be ready to wait, however.  There was only one order in front of mine and by the time I got my order it was almost 15 minutes.  As long as you know you will wait a bit, it's worth it.  I'll definitely go again - just wish there were one closer to my house."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place is now in Las Vegas!  Their char burgers are wonderful!  Their onion rings are legit!  Their milk shakes are to die!  And if your liking for the lighter their chicken salad is so yum! Did I mention their ranch"}
{"text":"This place is the best burger joint I have ever been to if you are looking for fast greasy food that is a great price and amazing!"}
{"text":"Have been hearing so much about this place - I was literally excited to finally try it.. I was not disappointed. It's a fairly small place for the volume of customers so seating was tight, probably has something to do with just opening I'm sure. The menu is easy to read and decide on even though I have never been there which was nice. Always frustrating going to a new place with a cluttered menu and you feel like you're holding up the line because you don't know what to order...aaaanyways.. Food was awesome, comparable to In-n-Out with more toppings/options. Service was fast and friendly and price was on par - little over $8 for a #2 (Double burger) no cheese with a drink and fries. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing as always. Double char with bacon and onions, friendly, fast, and attentive staff. Awesome half and half fries and onion rings are always great. This picture speaks for itself come to Habit!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger place around.  The burgers are cheap only in price.  The quality of the ingredients and the preparation of the food when combined with the price make this my #1 burger place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So much variety! They have great burgers and fries, but they also offer a grilled albacore tuna sandwich, a tri-tip sandwich, and one of the best chicken sandwiches I have ever had. Salads, sweet potato fries, fried green beans and oh so good onion rings. I am hooked."}
{"text":"Five stars for a fast food chain?  Yes!  Cleanliness, friendliness, speed, efficiency, and food quality were all on point.  This is the first of 12 Habit Burger Grill's coming to the Valley.  

They were somewhat busy when we stopped by for lunch today, but the line moved swiftly and the girl who took our was very sweet and proficient.  We had our receipt, drink cups, and our pager in less than a minute. Off we went to get drinks (Coke products, 3 different brewed iced tea choices, and strawberry lemonade), condiments, and some jalapeños from their pepper bar before sitting at a comfortable booth.  Our pager went off within a few minutes and we got to enjoy our delicious hot and fresh charburgers, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  

The charburger was juicy with a great flame broiled taste, the bun was light and fluffy, and the lettuce & tomato were fresh and crisp.

The orders of onion rings and sweet potato fries were both generous in portion size.  We could have shared one order, but how can you try both that way!  The onion rings had a great crunch and a tasty batter.  They provided ranch with our rings if you like to dip.  The sweet potato fries were very good as well.  They were on the softer side which I liked (not fried to a crisp so you can't even tell they are sweet potatoes).  Next time I want to try the Tempura Green Beans, because they looked really good too!  The salads and grilled chicken sandwich are also on my future visits list."}
{"text":"My office staff and I decided to give Habit burger a try. Everyone ordered their food online and one person picked it up. Apparently, I accidently put my card number in wrong (which I agree is my fault) and instead of calling me (they ask for your number when you place your order) they just cancelled out my order....So when my friend went to pick up the food, that's when  she was told. So my food didn't get cooked.  So then my food got cooked, while everyone else's sat. Then they got my order wrong! Wasn't a great first impression."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with my most recent visit here at the Habit. This was my second time while my first was during their opening week. I must say my first left me unimpressed and a lot left to be desired. I ordered the char burger and it was nothing spectacular. Plain and no flavors really stood out. However, on my most recent visit I had the Hawaiian burger protein style per Melissa V.'s recommendation. I was impressed because it was a must tastier burger than my initial visit. The pineapple was a nice twist as it complimented the burger well. The amount of Lettuce was impressive because it truly added that crunch factor and bite of freshness. But what truly made this tastier was the char flavor, this aspect was defiantly lacking my first time. Is this because their grill is more seasoned than when they first opened? I think YES! This is why I like trying out a place way after their grand opening. Also all the kinks have been worked out, in addition to the hype going down which means less lines. Also reading the reviews will usually lead you on what to order and how. If I'm craving a burger the Habit will definitely come to mind."}
{"text":"Been here twice and have a few observations: the staff is friendly, the interior is very clean, and it's a popular place but I think the burgers are mediocre. Not bad, but nothing you'll be writing home about; which is too bad because you'll have time to write home, write your childhood friends, write to relatives that you haven't spoken to in two decades, touch base with your favorite teacher from elementary school, and author a 300 page thesis analyzing the decline of feudalism after the Magna Carta was signed while you wait for your food.

Oh, and what a pleasant surprise...I got my burger and my AARP membership at the same time. I think you get the point. Don't get me wrong, I'd choose The Habit over the traditional fast food joints any day of the week, but it's a long wait for food that just makes the average mark on the scale."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and they are swift to get your food out. They have yummy salads that I didn't have to make and my boys love the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Solid, very solid, but not mind-blowing. Nicer and wider selection than in-n-out, and higher quality ingredients and bigger burgers in general, but also pricier. Nice patio for extra seating."}
{"text":"I went to Habit Burger for the first time today. I thought the burger was excellent and the price (for North Scottsdale) was reasonable."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! I was in the area, and thought I would give this place a try. I was needing some major protein, and thought why not a hamburger, yum. They offer many different healthier options for those trying to lose weight, and not wanting those extra carbs. I liked the atmosphere, it was clean and the staff was very nice. The place was very busy, and I felt the music was a bit loud, I felt like I had to raise my voice to carry on a casual conversation. Overall, fun place for a great hamburger."}
{"text":"So....  Where to begin. Let's start on the burgers as it is in the name of the restaurant. They were severely underwhelming. With an overall 4/5 stars I expected at least mediocre. I was, if you didn't catch on yet, disappointed to say the least. The burger patties and seasoning was mediocre at best. I was asked if all the toppings including grilled onions were OK when ordering. Sure, I gleefully replied. Who doesn't like grilled onions? If you don't like them, stop reading your taste buds are broken anyway. Well grilled onions turns out to mean raw diced onions that just barely touched the grill. They were warmed, sort of, but still very much a raw onion. The buns were lacking and produced no memories good or bad. The burger had a very standard, fried burger flavor overall. On to the fries. Not much good to say about those either. More than half were greatly overcooked. Seasoning on them was also extremely inconsistent. Some had no salt, some were so salty I got instantly dehydrated and needed to have IV fluids. The other thing that bothered me (that's right you get more complaining) was the workers. I am all for skirting around my job functions and hanging out with friends but the location they decided to do this was strange. There was literally no one else in the restaurant besides my friend and I. The workers decided to hang out right in front of the drinks, ketchup, and pepper area and talk to each on on either side of the counter. I patiently waited until my burger was finished to get my fixings hoping they would move. They did not. I had to say excuse me while holding my tray to get ketchup. You couldn't pick a place to hang out that wasn't in the way? I mean seriously the entire restaurant was empty...  Needless to say at this point, I will not be going back. Two stars only because I did not get sick. 
Well at least not yet."}
{"text":"Super food salad was soaked in dressing, it wasn't very healthy. Fries were cold. Burger was good. Too many great burger restaurants in area to come back here for so-so experience."}
{"text":"This was first time here I will be back food was delicious disappointed they didn't carry pastrami sandwich but I would recommend coming here"}
{"text":"My favorite new hamburger! I've been an In N Out fan for a long time but Habit beats that now!!! I would recommend this place to everyone I know!!!"}
{"text":"Recommendation from a family member.. First time eating here.. I ordered the garlic portabella mushroom burger with onion rings... It was decent... The tempura greens were very good... The staff is nice and the restaurant is clean. The food was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is the BOOMMBBB. Move over In-n-Out, this is my new burger place. These burgers beat out most \"fine\" dining burger joints (how is a burger considered fine dining?) for half the cost. The fries are the s**t too. I could honestly eat here every day if I wanted to. Not only is the food great, but they also provide SUPER quick and friendly service. I drove in through the drive through behind ten other cars (that enough should say how good this place is) and was out in under 10 minutes."}
{"text":"A shout out to Maggie and Juvia for running a fantastic restaurant! Each time we visited this restaurant, we are greeted with smiles and above and beyond service! It really makes a big difference.  The food is great! Not salty and very fresh. I would highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. A little pricey for a burger joint. It was hot and fresh but I feel like it's the price of a restaurant burger for a fast food burger"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers my favorite is the teriyaki char Can't be the value much better than other franchises I only wish they had a drive-through"}
{"text":"Great service and good quick burgers. I'm not a burger fiend like my partner so I love coming here when he craves his weekly burger because they have great salads and seasonal salads if your palate is looking to try something other than the traditional Caesar or garden with/without ahi or chicken. 
My favorite burger is the portabella char. For a fast food joint, the mushrooms pack a lot of flavor, I often get it without the beef patty. 
The shakes are flavorful and if you have a sweet tooth like my partner you can get cones and sundaes! 
I also recommend subbing the fries with the green beans!"}
{"text":"SLOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW drive thru.  I honestly think they start the order after payment is collected. Delicious burger means I'll keep going back but avoid the drive thru forever."}
{"text":"Went to The Habit with my husband & sister  after a movie one night. Their hours were good...open till 10pm (I think) and the staff was very helpful & friendly. 
The food was good...hard to stand out & have the BEST burger in the area with so much excellent competition so close.  I would recommend the sweet potato fries instead of regular fries  
Also, I tried to go there for lunch Friday but the line was out the door & around the building....so they must be doing something right!"}

Quick Review
*This rating and review is based on a series of firsthand experiences of patronising this restaurant located on Flamingo/Paradise.
*For the purposes of contextualization of this review: I have never visited any other The Habit Burger Grill location. I was a Habit virgin.
*Some items I have tried: Charburger, Double Charburger with Cheese, Veggie Burger, Chicken sandwich, Chicken Club, Sweet Potato Fries, Fries, Strawberry Shake, Strawberry Limeade. All good or better.

Pro Tip: Strawberry shake is the best I have had at a fast food-casual. The music being played is also the best in terms of FF-C.

-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------

Someone convinced me to try The Habit; I was at Coachella. I looked in at the location in Indio; however, the enormous crowds that congregated during April were just too long of a wait for fast food or fast casual or whatever the fuck this is considered. 

So, I never tried it until it debuted in Vegas. And even then: I was not in a rush. It was the No Kid Hungry® charity campaign that brought me in the doors and subsequently made me a fan. The food is solid for fast food/casual; the strawberry limeade might be the best drink I have ever had at any fast food/casual anywhere. Easily would go the proverbial distance in a bout against the strawberry limeade at Cafe Rio®. Only way to find out would be a double blind test. 

Pro Tip: Get the strawberry limeade. It's Best in Show.

-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------

Step 1: Place your order with the personable order-taker. 

Step 2: Take the buzzer and proceed to wait/wash your filthy hands since you just felt up a buzzer that has been touched by a hundred people who spend all day doing everything besides washing their hands.

Step 3: Eat. 

Step 4: Refill your strawberry limeade before hitting the road.

Pro Tip: Construction on Flamingo makes it cumbersome to get back on Paradise. Drive north on Hughes Circle until it leads to Paradise just south of Gordon Biersch. This could be helpful to UNLV or Hard Rock Hotel visitors.

Rating: Five-stars, \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\""}
{"text":"Excellent!  Arrived at our Phoenix hotel after a 6 day tour of northern Arizona and we were too tired to sit down at a restaurant.  I found this place on Yelp with the delivery/pick up filter.  I used their website to place and pay for a pickup order.  Website was easy to use, and as soon as I finished the order we left for the 15 minute drive to retrieve the food.  Food was ready when we arrived and pick up was easy.

Food was fresh.  Picky kids all ate dinner without complaint.  The real challenge was my husband.  He enjoyed the burger and the side Caesar salad.  Very good was his rating, which is akin to a rave review.

I marked down one star as my salad had no dressing.  The salad, the Cobb, was tasty without the dressing, but I still would have preferred the option of having some type of dressing for my salad."}
{"text":"I personally didn't make a habit of going to this place, but I can see how one could.  There are many delicious burger options in Phoenix and The Habit Burger Grill is worth mentioning on that list.  The burgers are tender and juicy, very delicious and cooked just right.  Delicious salty fries.  Service is fast and perfect for to go orders.  Upon my return to the Phoenix metro area, I will consider The Habit more often when I crave a burger...and that is pretty often."}
{"text":"Got 2 charburgers. One of them was missing bacon and had avocado on it which was not what was Ordered. Got a Cobb salad. Probably the worst salad I've ever had, lettuce was kinda funky, could barely find the egg, cheese, and bacon. But just had a weird funky taste like old food"}
{"text":"Pleased with a quick double char. First time visit. Despite the photos I did not come across errant pubic hairs in the bathroom. Very clean restaurant and good service.Char burger was made right and had good taste."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service! My friend and I come here every week after cycling class for our salad and one of the employees named Lesley remembers our order every time. She's really lovely and attentive. Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Comparable to In and Out on their burgers. Their menu is a bit diverse than other drive thru joints.  I have tried their mushroom burger and double char but I love their Santa Barbara burger on sourdough bread. The milk shake is a must try! So creamy and not too sweet. I'll have to get their malts next time. If you're on a budget and in a hurry but don't want to break the bank, The Habit and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As someone from Cali and who loves the habit I'm overly excited that there is one in walking distance to my home.
So the habit just opened and I know they are still working out the little issues.  So I can't really right a bad review just yet because I love the habit.
So I posted pictures. I got the teriyaki style chicken sandwich. Had a little bit of miscommunication with the girl behind the register she didn't understand that you could get a chicken sandwich teriyaki style(again they just opened so it happens). Along with their sweet potato fries which are amazing!!!
My husband got a burger which obviously you can never go wrong with an amazing cheeseburger and regular fries
Also a must must when you go get the strawberry limeade!!! Omg.
I know I will be here all the time
I'm a sucker for a great chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place.  The burgers are fantastic!  The shakes/malts are the best!! the service is on point.  While waiting for our order, they realized they had made an extra shake, instead of throwing it away they offered it to us!   I also got to hear how they all got along and it was a pleasure to listen to them have fun as well as work towards completing the orders.  Welcome to Henderson!!"}
{"text":"I'll give two stars. I called ahead to order a grilled chicken burger, fries and a shake. On arrival I wait in the \"pick up\" counter, don't get acknowledged. Then finally one of the girls says it will be ready soon.. 15 min later the same girl walks up to  me and hands me a shake. Okay. So I'm standing there for another 20 minutes with now a melted shake in my hand. Horrible service. So much staff not working together."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town with amazing fries.  We have been here twice already and have really enjoyed the different char burgers we get.

I personally love the teriyaki char which has teriyaki sauce and pineapple.  We have gotten sweet potato and regular fries and they both excellent.

Customer service is great and a nice location.  Burgers are tasty and have so many different combinations for all different people."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. Ordered two burgers, two shakes and an order of the tempura green beans. The burgers where ok at best. Meat was good but the buns where so burnt and smashed down, making them super hard. Half way through the burger we both got tired of eating it and tossed the buns in the garbage. Tried letting management know about my experience but no one ever picks up. Shakes and green beans where good. I'll try them again sometime but so far I'm not impressed at all."}
{"text":"PROS:
-Appetizing sweet potato fries

FOOD 3/5:
TBH the santabara style burger ($5.95) was OK. It had avocado, cheese & other expected burger items but it wasn't doing any justice. For a $6 burger, I expected a delicious patty. The patty tasted bland, like a Mcdonalds patty. The bread was toasty good. 
-Sweet potato fries (2.80): no complaints here, they made it crispy & yummy

CONS:
-Rather go to in n out. $10 for a burger meal is kinda expensive."}
{"text":"Quite enjoyable food. Bit pricy  but everywhere is nowadays. The burgers were really good but the fries were nothing special at all. I liked that they had some unique dishes (such as the tuna burger) & various salads to choose from which is much appreciated for the health conscious moments. Wish there was a drive through but that would probably ruin the atmosphere which is a nice one albeit a usually busy one."}
{"text":"Found the Habit Burger on a trip to California, it quickly became a Habit to find one very time we go to California. Grew up in California on In-N-Out and could never get enough. Now my new favorite is the Habit, still love you In-n-Out.  But am truly excited they opened the Vegas location.  Same quality and Gretat service as California locations. Been there 3 times since this location opened and will be back even though it is not close to where I live. Keep it up Habit."}
{"text":"Burgers are made to order, fry's are hot and fresh.  Good drink selection.  Burgers are not too big or small.  Just right!  Run down your arm delicious!  There is almost always a line but it moves fast.  My favorite burger joint!"}
{"text":"I rarely if ever write a review, but this burger joint deserves five stars, went there with a buddy yesterday, this place has the best burger that I have had in over 20 years in this area!!  The fries are also almost perfect, just having slightly to much salt for my taste.  The fries had actually been par cooked properly, and then they were deep fried to near perfection!"}
{"text":"First time here and there was a line out the door so I figured this place would be awesome. The reason the line was out the door is because they had 1 person taking orders ( they had 2 registers) and he took forever. If you ordered a ice cream cone he made it slowly, another person just standing behind the counter looking oblivious. When I finally did get my burger I was excited to try it. I got a chardouble. It was bland, I wanted to add salt. Anyway probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best \"quick\" burger places in town. It's always great quality and consistent everytime I go there. THe customer service is a puls too."}
{"text":"Try the regular hamburger on sour dough.  Excellent combo.  Great price and good food.  Milkshakes are relish."}
{"text":"Decent burgers, but nothing special. Personally I prefer In and Out Burger to this. Taste like regular burgers off the grill. The décor inside is nice and feels more restaurant like than fast food. They also have fresh made lemonades that are good in addition to regular soda fountain drinks and peppers you can add to your burger."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Habit as it was new to me. Although the reviews weren't raves, I stopped in for lunch. The service was fast and friendly and the location clean. I did think it was pricey for not having table service and the food was ok. I had the mushroom Swiss. It didn't appear that these were fresh mushrooms and the cheese had an odd texture. There is also a difference between a toasted bun bad one that so getting stale. It was pretty firm. I'm glad I tried Habit but I'm not sure I would return even with a coupon or special offer. Just think there are better $8 lunch options."}
{"text":"Great burgers, french fries, & onion rings. The burger is fresh and juicy and the sides are hot and flavorful. There is a tasty ranch dressing served with the onion rings. The vanilla malt is thick and rich. The restaurant is clean and inviting."}
{"text":"Good food for a decent price. It's not legendary in the sense that Zinburger is and it lacks that level of awesomeness like Remington Grill in my home state of NC has, but it's pretty good. Imagine someone taking a frozen burger like you'd buy at Fry's, Sam's Club, or Costco, and they do a really awesome job grilling it. That's the best way I can describe the burgers here. They are really good - just in that \"best runner up\" category - rather than true champions.  As for the restaurant itself, it was pretty clean and had a decent selection of both indoor and outdoor seating.  My only real complaint is that the cashier who took our order had that \"hurry up and get it over with\" attitude. Other than that, I wouldn't mind coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Amazing service! First time at this location on saturday and we will go out of our way to come back more often. You walk in and you're greeted with a smile and a 'Hello!' Waited total of 30 seconds before ordering. Fast service! The burgers were great as well as the fries. While we were eating some of the girls were taking trash off tables when people were finished eating. Almost like we were at a sit down restaurant and not a fast food place!"}
{"text":"Worst burger experience. The burger was not grilled. It tasted it was steamed and held in water. It is called double char for a reason."}
{"text":"the burgers were good but it seemed like a more expensive version of in and out burger. it's close so i'm sure i'll go back , but i wasn't very impressed and the \"spuer smiley\" employees seemed really forced.."}
{"text":"I love this place been several times and never been disappointed.  They are so willing and nice about special orders."}
{"text":"Nice place. Price is cheap. Good atmosphere. Definitely a good stopover to get some really good burgers and fries. I like it here, not just its clean but also the service here is good."}
{"text":"Man...this is a very good burger spot. Plus the burgers are a good size. I got a double and was totally full, so nxt time I'll stick with the single patty. But really the burgers had good flavor, not dry at all and fresh fries. Clean area and friendly workers."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by co-workers and it did live up to expectations. Great burgers with nice healthy options. Plenty of space to sit and service was relatively quick. I think they are still working out a few kinks with their staff and getting food out to customers but I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to come here a few times before posting just to make sure the consistency was there, and now after trying their new Golden Chicken Sandwich tonight, I'm sold.  It's official.  The Habit Burger Grill is absolutely CRUSHING it!!!  Killer burgers, a new awesome spicy fried chicken sandwich (you guys gotta keep this bad boy around!), great fries, tasty onion rings, tempura green beans, shakes, malts and just about everything and anything you could possibly want from a fast food burger joint!  When you throw in their grilled chicken and grilled albacore tuna sanwich options along with their salads, they literally have something for everyone.  I honestly see no need to waste time going anywhere else when the fast food bug bites.  We are lucky to have this little gem in our area.  Do yourself a solid and try it if you haven't.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"So this is the Habit Burger I've been hearing so much about. I have to say I like it. Love the ambience, the decor and the music. Although still very new, the staff don't look overwhelmed at all.

They only had one register working when we went but the line went fast. You order, they give you a buzzer thingy(haha) and wait for it to BUZZ. I was pleasantly surprised by the 3 kinds of chili peppers at the condiment counter. Aside from the soda fountain, they have 3 kinds of freshly brewed iced teas and 2 other specialty drinks. My favorite so far is the peach & ginger nectar. It was refreshing with a little zing. I even got some small pieces of ginger. In my drink...yum.

We ordered a Santa Barbara for the hubby, a char burger for me and a kid's char burger meal for the kiddo. All our burgers looked so good, I couldn't wait to take a bite. The veggies and the pickles in the sandwich was delicious. I liked that the lettuce was shredded. The hubby enjoyed his Santa Barbara. My burger was pretty good too especially with the peppers. The fries were crisp as well.

Although we enjoyed our meal, I still prefer the burgers and fries at In-N-Out. They do have items on the menu that I would like to try so we will definitely be back. Might even sneak in a big jug so I can take more of that peach & ginger nectar home."}
{"text":"The best strawberry limeade I've ever had. I could come here just for it. Love the salad options. Great variety but still simple. Love an easy menu. 
Ps
Teriyaki burgers will always be my favorite."}
{"text":"With this location opened up I can finally have the burger and fries I loved in Tempe now here in Avondale. Although I had a bad first few experiences here with missing fries and missing chicken from a salad, I contacted them via email and they gave me a fast response and accommodated me which makes me a fan for life. The burger is good and the onion rings and fries are always amazing. Cant forget the staff who are always friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, great experience!

After we were done eating one of the employees came by and picked up all of our food and when we left he even opened the door for us. Well done guys!"}
{"text":"After posting about two of our visits to this location and having a less than satisfactory experience, I received a phone call from Habit headquarters. I gave a detailed account of everything and they were apologetic and anxious to make it right. Although I vowed to never go back to this particular location, my son talked me into it because we were right next door. The service and food was excellent. The staff was attentive and the burgers were perfect! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"One of my go to burger places.

My fave is the Santa Barbara Burger. The patties are super juicy and not overcooked. The bread is toasted and fresh. Of course you cant go wrong with adding avocado to anything!

They recently added Bourbon french fries. They are so delish. The fries are crispy and fresh and dusted with savory seasoned salt. The bourbon sauce is on the side when ordering to go. They have the best ranch as well.So get a side of that too lol
The green tea was also very tasty and not to sweet. 

This location is kind of inconvenient as far as parking. Theres a bunch of stores and restaraunts crammed in a small parking lot. Theres almost always a wait but everything is cooked to order, so its worth it."}
{"text":"My go to spot for a good burger.  Much better than five guys and smash burger in my opinion.  Onion rings are absolutely delicious, and the burgers are the perfect cross between the lightness of an in and out burger and the heaviness of five guys.

Highly recommend this spot if in tempe and need a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Not bad at all...actually really good! We stumbled up on this place and it definitely won't be our last time. I only eat beef burgers maybe 4 times a year and this one was worth my 1st quarter consumption . But what I truly enjoyed was the ONION RINGS....those things were made with love! The burger itself is a good char broiled burger that's pretty filling. They make a handmade strawberry limeade that's pretty delish. To round everything out the service was great, and the staff was friendly. Maybe we will save some room for an ice cream cone!"}
{"text":"Mostly food from here was good, however last time I went there found a long brunette hair in my food. Definitely lost my appetite for The Habit"}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this place. I have been here on a few different occasions and always impressed. The food and service are very good! The food always comes out fast tasting fresh! 

Gluten Free: Although they do not have a menu, every person who has ever taken my order has known what is gluten free and what is not. They also always inform the cooks to keep my meal separate so it does not cross contaminate with other food. For a 'fast food' place, this place is possibly the best place to go if you are looking for quick stop that takes gluten free serious. 

I will definitely keep going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Came in today and tried the chicken Caesar salad. This is my third different salad  I've tried here and it's very good. I also on the advice of a friend, decided to try the sweet potato fries. They were very good  no they were tasty good! And if I AGAIN tortured myself with a chocolate shake!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome!

Burger was hot and juicy, I ordered the teriyaki burger.
Onion rings were crispy, but not greasy. And not falling apart!

Pries were very reasonable.

I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. The charburger was tasteless. I had all the toppings including cheese on my burger and could not taste them. Very bland burger. The bun fell apart half way through eating the burger. It is very messy to eat and  they do not give you a box or plate to eat it over. The burger drips all over the table. The fries also were tasteless. Only plus is they have Coke products. Definitely will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"Wow my taste buds were dancing as I enjoyed my burger here. We has the teriyaki cheeseburgers. It is inexpensive and if one has not gone even once it is a must. The burger they make melts in your mouth. 

If you eat in the restaurant then they give you the vibrating black disc and when it buzzes then time for chow. The staff even has a lobby person whom comes around to take excess garbage and other guest needs. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The only complaint an individual could see from the hungry customers in line is not enough seating since they are so busy."}
{"text":"Had the Santa Barbra char. I would not order again. All the components sound delicious, but in reality it was a disappointment. The ratios were way off. I could barely taste the meat with the overwhelming amount of grilled sourdough. Had to pull top off (and along went the cheese) to make it even reasonable. Hamburgers themselves are small, but with good flavor. 
Fries were excellent, and I liked the free chili (pepper) bar.
Chocolate shake was pretty good, and reasonably priced.
I would try them again, but something on a regular bun. Hopefully that would have a better bread to meat ratio."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really craving a cheeseburger so we chose this restaurant. We ordered the #1 with cheese and my husband added bacon. The burger was good but not great. The fries that we got with the burger were a little under cooked and very salty. I love that they have a condiment bar.  Next time I will try a salad I heard they are great."}
{"text":"Delicious diet coke. Check
Amazing ranch to dip my fries or onion rings. Check
Friendly service. Check 
Fried options: fries or onion rings. Delicious. And check!


I specifically remember saying \"I don't usually like tomato and lettuce on my burger because they get hot and weird, but here they are crisp and delicious!\" 

For a chain, it's a pretty great burger.
Juicy. Check
Flavorful. Check
Fresh ingredients. Check."}
{"text":"Honestly, I haven't even tried the food yet, but I just want to say how AMAZING the service was. The two girls working the register were very helpful and friendly, giving me options because my online order hadn't processed yet. Not to mention how quick the food was prepared! I might have been waiting ten minutes tops! That's service right there. It's what I love to see, and it's what will definitely bring me back!"}
{"text":"Solid burger, kind of pricey though. The fries were super okay though."}
{"text":"We stop in here any time we're hitting the retail stretch on Blue Diamond. Every time we come, the food is on par. Walking in, the menu is approachable and easy to read. The staff is friendly and helpful. 

Considering the food is made to order, the pagers go off quickly. Burgers are always fresh and flavorful. Toppings are crisp and delicious. And the pickle bar is a nice touch. Prices for what you get are completely reasonable. 

Always get the Santa Barbara Char. Such a great burger on that sourdough. Sides are great as well. Fries, rings, green beans... Highly recommended. More bang for your buck than the In n Out down the way."}
{"text":"We happened to arrive about a quarter to closing and our food was fresh, we were able to eat inside and friendly, helpful service. This the most phenomenal burger joint I've ever had. Loads of flavor in every bite. Great customer service, great atmosphere... But that burger tho!! Fiya!! Lol! New favorite spot, no doubt."}
{"text":"Not the same place I tried in Orlando!!!! 

The food in Orlando was so good I went 3xs!! This place is a joke. 1st off the cashier was trying to fly thru my order and screwed it up verbally, then she still gave me a burger w/cheese when I requested it not 2 have cheese. So I had to drive 15mins back to have a burger remade w/no cheese. 

Got home the burger doesn't seem to be fresh patted out ground beef, but more of a frozen beef pattie style burger, which it was ok for a starving person, but not a gourmet burger. Fries were fresh, but everyone shared the same sentiment about the burgers. They're just OK. With In N Out & 5 Guys near I'll stick w/theirs instead."}
{"text":"I went to this location a few days ago after a few district managers came into my T-Mobile store and needed help. They told me their food was better then In and Out Burger. I said what? That is hard to believe because in and out is very tasty. However I did tell them that I did feel bad after eating in and out because of its grease Factor. They told me they hear that a lot. So after my first experience and Habit Burger I must say that I was beyond impressed. Not only was the store layout very nice and spacious but the store itself was clean the staff was friendly the person who took my order asked me if I'd been here before I told no I asked him what was good he told me what he liked I place my order and it arrived after a few moments everything was good and perfectly cooked the drink selection wasn't great I got a Strawberry Limeade which was delicious. Even after I was done eating they had somebody come and pick up my tray and empty it for me which I am not used to. That was a pleasant surprise. Now their fries were very good the burger was good the food was good the people were good that it was great I must say my experience at this Habit Burger was a better experience than any In and Out Burger I've been to."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. All the hype, all the recommendations. It's in close proximity to my house and I often crave a good burger.

The biggest issue I have with this place is the quality (or lack thereof) of their meat. The patties taste equal to most cheap fast food joints. I definitely prefer in and out, five guys or shake shack. I probably prefer Burger King, McDonald's or Carl's Jr. I can't say I'll be coming out my way to have another burger from here. Would I have it again? Sure."}
{"text":"I was on an overnight road trip with a friend of mine and we stopped here to grab dinner. ( Cheaper than eating at the resort lol) 
We arrived to find no line! This was a bonus because the location in Tucson always is busy. The staff at the registers were super friendly and even offered suggestions to my friend and her kids as they've never been.  The food was ready in no time at all.  The restaurant was clean.
The food did not disappoint. The burger was perfect the bun was perfect the fries were amazing and crispy.  I was very happy that we stopped here for dinner.  If you're looking for something fast food that tastes better than fast food... I would recommend this burger place."}
{"text":"I had the #2 Charburger with onion rings instead of fries. Really good burger. The cashier was friendly and helpful. I really liked the tropical tea. Good place for a burger, could become a habit!;)"}
{"text":"Got one burger, one grilled chicken sandwich and one sweet potato fries. I really cannot complain about anything. The burger was cooked good and tasted like a burger should taste like. The sandwich was on a toasted bread with avocado and tomatoes, also very tasty.

I'm actually surprised that this place got so many low ratings, considering it was packed and therefore seemed to be a popular spot. Also a plus - the pepper bar. I love anything pickled and I love peppers, so I was definitely a happy customer."}
{"text":"The Habit - Henderson, NV

I am a fan of The Habit Burger Grill.  I'm just not a huge fan of this location.  I've been here multiple times and I prefer the other locations around town over this one.  I was craving Habit's Double Char (double patty/double cheese) and on my most recent visit, got a Triple Char (triple patty/triple cheese).  It's a good thing that I went with the triple because the patties were a lot smaller than what I'm used to.  I also like a juicy burger, not a greasy one.  A greasy burger is what I got.  Overall, I recommend The Habit, just not this one.  I really can't complain about the service.  It was good and my burger was served quickly."}
{"text":"I'm stoked!  We got The Habit on our side of town.  If you guys know me, then you know that I'm an In-N-Out type diehard.  But that doesn't mean that I won't stop by The Habit for their Double Char Burger and Tri-Tip Sandwich.  If I'm willing to cheat on In-N-Out, then their burgers must be good, right?  Everything here is made to order and their burgers are charbroiled.  The burgers here are delicious, juicy, and very affordable.  What sets The Habit apart from some of their competition is that savoring charbroiled taste on all their burgers.  Their Double Char is only $4.25 and their Tri-Tip Steak is $6.99.  In my opinion, this is a steal of a price.  Side options include fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, tempura green beans, and salad. Dessert options include shakes, malts, vanilla soft serve, and sundaes.  

The food is good and the service was excellent.  They do a great job keeping this place clean, managing the lines, and taking care of their customer's needs.  I even noticed that our table was cleaned immediately after we got done with our meal.  We arrived hungry and left very satisfied.  Good Job, Habit!  You'll see me again soon.

2017 Yelp Review #88"}
{"text":"Honestly very disappointed, mainly because of a terrible associate named Lindsay. Rolling her eyes at us, slamming cups down, zero attempt at any kind of nicety like a simple smile. I did not appreciate how she treated my mother firstly, and myself, and I'm certain that she does not stand for Habits core values. To be quite frank she was simply a bitch. This is clearly not her intended line of work. I will never be going to this restaurant again. I will say the manager seemed to take note of this, and tried to make things right, and I did appreciate that. But I was too upset by this associate to take her up on any of her offers because more than anything I just wanted to be out of that space."}
{"text":"It's finally open! And yes, their burgers are delicious. I had a basic #1 combo but opted for the onion rings instead of the fries. The onion rings were crispy on the outside with a nice whole onion ring on the inside. Perfectly executed.

Their burger was tasty, I got mayo, pickles, basically the works. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Good customer service and they have a decent size patio to sit at, with heaters so you won't be cold if it's a little too chilly."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. I got the Portabella mushroom burger which was pretty good as well as the BBQ Bacon burger which wasn't bad but also wasn't satisfying. The food wasn't bad but it also didn't leave an impression on me afterwards whatsoever. I got the tempura green beans to go and when I got home I had to put my own seasoning on them because they were very bland. Worth the stop if you are passing by, however not a place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST. BURGER. EVER. I'm from the West Coast, now living in Dallas. Without fail, I'll seek out a Habit Burger when I travel back home. Their burgers are fresh and their fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings are delish. Name your burger - In n Out, Whataburger, Smashburger - they don't compare to The Habit! 

This restaurant was clean, staff was friendly and service was quick."}
{"text":"This place first of all had the friendly and helpful staff I have come across in a while. Hey. I just want to remind you about the ugly sweater party on December 12 at 7. Hope you can make it. I hired a taco guy. Just bring your cocktail and anything else to snack on. The girl named Dorothy at the counter was very help for our first time. I love the suggestion she give me. I had the Santa Barbara and that they had a selection of ice teas. The strawberry limeade is awesome. I left there happy and full. And I did go back again that same week."}
{"text":"Great great great food. My Lil brother n mom both work there. They have been trying to get me to go eat there. Loved the food love the place. Thank u for your great service n having great food"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the char-burgers and the tri-tip sandwich is amazing. Try the fried green beans with ranch, they are amazing."}
{"text":"1st time eating here & staff was great. Ordered the #1 charburger meal w/fries. Menu says \"toasted bun & crisp lettuce\"...didn't get either of those. The bun actually became soggy a bit because of it, I think. Fries were yummy though! I loved the lil condiment & hot sauce bar they had. And it was super clean! Fast & friendly service w/plenty of seating, inside & outside!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Great food and Awesome Burgers!! Cass was super fun and had amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"I had the \"double charburger\" with cheese, mayo and lettuce only, a side of sweet potato fries and a coffee ice cream shake. Total was $10 and some change.
The burger was really good and juicy and reminded me a lot of Fatburger in both presentation and taste. The shake was also pretty good - says right on the side that they use real ice cream. It wasn't very strong in coffee flavour, though, and had no real coffee in it (that would be something to entice me to order it again). The fries were good but far from the best sweet potato fries I've had. There was hardly any seasoning. They should try battering or glazing them to make them stand out. They were much tastier than their regular fries, though - those were limp, tasteless and boring.  
It was a decent meal and fun to try but I'm not sure if it was worth the $10+ dollars I spent."}
{"text":"First time here.... It was pretty much amazing! I had the Santa Barbara burger! Super excellent! The manager on the floor was nice and friendly as well! 
Two thumbs up!!! 
Ps the onion rings looks really good too, but I had the fries. Next time I'll order them."}
{"text":"Im very disappointed in the Habit on Decatur and 215 . I would like to give them 0 stars. I've been coming here with my girlfriend for awhile now at least a couple times a month. My girlfriend and I decided to go there (Monday,May 14th,2018) after I worked a 12 hour shift without eating all day and thought The Habit would fill the spot. So we went in and ordered the usual (double char burger meal and bbq chicken salad) We had gotten our food and started eating having a good time till i bit into my burger and felt a very sharp pain hit my tooth(like a teeth freeze feeling) and almost swallowing. I decided to take whatever it was out my mouth (thinking maybe it was a hard piece of lettuce ) when i had pulled out the object it turned out to be a double wire twist tie ( first picture below ) I then showed my girlfriend what I just pulled out my mouth and we were both stunned. She instantly said I could've choke and even possibly had it stuck in my throat. The thought of that instantly went through my mind and I even thought of my little brothers and sisters because it could've been in a little kids mouth and they wouldn't have even known. So with no hesitation I picked up my tray of food where I approached an employee (not knowing if it was a manager because she didn't have a name tag on) and explained what I found in my food. She quickly grabbed the twist tie out of my hand and said if i wanted a new burger. I said no I wanted a refund and a credit for a free meal next time I came in because i didn't feel comfortable eating another one of their burgers at the moment not knowing if more objects were in the food. When she gave me my \"refund\" back it was only $4. ( double char burger meal equals $10.32) when i was walking back i realized it was only $4 so I went back up there and said I wanted a full refund not even half of what I paid for. So after arguing with her she finally gives me back my refund and added a remark basically saying they don't use twist ties for anything and trying to say I did this to myself (putting the twist tie in my OWN food) . Then I said I wanted a credit for a free meal next time I come in and she said no they don't do that its either a refund or another meal ( mind you when I confronted them about the twist tie the chef who made my burger was laughing with the \"manager\" and other employees) I then let my girlfriend finish her food and explained to her what happened she was so upset the way they treated us that we went back up there and asked for the main office number to explain what just happened  to us. They said they don't have a number to contact and just handed us a menu. At this point we were fed up with the games they were playing and ask to speak to the chef. The manager then said he doesn't speak English and she had to talk to him in Spanish. We are so disappointed in the restaurant and customer service we got. I really hope this will be heard out through the upper hand because this could've sent me or someone else to the hospital and did some real damage. Thankfully the only damaged that happened was a chip on my front tooth that I'm still really upset about. I really hope to hear back from the restaurant! 

Sincerely , Fabian B."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Habit for years now, always great food and quality are very fair prices. They have some interesting drink options as well. With all of the new fast casual dining options in the PV mall area popping up recently, this has remained towards the top of my list to favorites."}
{"text":"I have heard from others how good this place was, so I tried it with some co-workers.  I give it a solid three stars and so did my 3 other co-workers.  

The burgers were good and we would all return but none of us thought the burgers deserved the \"wow\" factor."}
{"text":"In the mood for a good, cheap burger that isnt In and Out, Five Guys, or from one of the popular national food chains? Go here. Beware the double onions though..."}
{"text":"Decent burger, decent fries.  Not fantastic, but not bad.  They are not very flavorful, but the ingredients are very fresh.  Can't stand the lettuce and tomato under the meat, but tastes the same either way.  The interior is nothing special either.  Fries are made fresh to order, they are crispy and cooked well, but bland.  I might visit this place again, but I would not go out of my way to.  To be honest, a whopper tastes a bit better."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating at Habit, first let me begin by telling you that these employees are amazingly friendly, kind, and courteous. The food is just to die for! You should try it at least once you won't be disappointed. Then the sweetest employees come by wanting to take your trash for you that's a company that is committed to customer service."}
{"text":"This took over the \"My Florist Cafe\" a downtown Phoenix staple that will be missed.  The Burger shop has a fresh new look to the area and is great for that corner.

There was good parking which is not the case across the street at 5 Guys so I think they will gain more business.

Atmosphere - 6
Food - 6

It was a great price for the meal - $6.70 for Burger, Drink, Fries.  I would call it a gloried In n Out.  
I would rank it better then 5 Guys, just behind SmashBurger but WAY behind Fuddruckers."}
{"text":"The staff is very well trained. Superior service! The food is delicious as well and the facility was well kept. Great little spot."}
{"text":"We ordered a hamburger, kids meal with fries, fried green beans and a side salad. It was take out. They had three different people filling the orders. They failed to give us the french fries for the kids meal. They failed to give us a side of pickles and mayo that we asked for.  Food was OK. I called there number and got a main ordering center which release the orders to the restaurants. There is nobody that you can talk to regarding this unless you go back to the restaurant.  The best they could do was to have me log on the Internet and write a comment that we may go to the main office and possibly relayed back to the restaurant at some other time other than tonight. Seems a little worthless that there's no way of getting hold of the restaurant at that time. I don't think I'll go back to the place since every time we have been there, there's been mistakes on it.  We will pass on this habit."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger place. 

I really don't have anything good or bad to say about this place. They server a hot burger and fries that were good. 


It's fast food with out a drive through. 

Clean place. 

I would return and try them again. But not go out of my way to find them."}
{"text":"I decided to give this chain a second shot that would also serve as an effort to turn over every stone in this area of Henderson. Ultimately, it didn't quite pass muster.

The Habit Burger Grill is a burger chain from Santa Barbara with a pretty extensive presence in SoCal, and they've recently established a few outposts in the Las Vegas area. I wasn't impressed by my first visit to one of those SoCal locations, but I figured that I should give them another try someday. This one is close enough to me for me to visit it casually, so I made that day today.

They were pretty busy around the Sunday dinner rush, with quite a few families and white-haired individuals in the customer base. I had time to consider the entire menu while waiting in line, while appreciating the calorie counts. Since I didn't want a sandwich and I wasn't interested in too many premium toppings, I kept it simple and chose a Double Charburger ($4.25) with cheese (+$0.60), and the typical French Fries ($2.00). Noting that the combo pricing does not offer any savings over the a la carte costs, I decided not to burn money on a fountain drink ($1.90 for a small).

While waiting, I was able to grab water (don't forget to ask for the cup) and take a look around. They have a ketchup dispenser, a few sauces including hot sauces, and some chopped peppers. There are also some non-soda drinks that are probably not that much healthier. As for the decor, it's actually a very nice, welcoming, and clean place to enjoy a meal, so I was glad that I opted against taking it to-go. If I wasn't so food-oriented, they'd get brownie points for this, as well as for the friendly employees (although I was a bit miffed that the employee asking folks how their meal was going skipped me).

My buzzer angrily attacked my table when they had my food ready (perhaps 5-6 minutes after the order), so I traded the square vibrator for the food, grabbed some ketchup, and returned to my booth. I tried some of the fries first. They were properly seasoned, and they were crispy when fresh, but became fairly limp by the time I'd finished my burger. They weren't that fluffy inside either. At least they were seasoned well and carried the ketchup alright.

The burger came out with two beef patties, two slices of cheese (I'd actually feared that it might only be one), and a multitude of standard ingredients: lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, mayo, and pickles. I actually quite enjoyed the beef even though it was gray as death. It was still fairly moist (aided by the cheese of course) and I caught a subtle yet distinct pepper flavor. However, nothing else was anything special, including the bun and especially the caramelized onions.

The Habit Burger Grill was pretty good, but they still didn't impress me enough for me to divert my fast-casual burger attention from other chains with stores in this area. I won't be likely to return too often, especially with a certain fast-food chicken hype train set to arrive just across the street very soon."}
{"text":"I like this Habit Burger. The staff is fabulous and the food is really good. I always get treated so well at this location so it is the only one I go to."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is always made fresh when ordered and the customer service is always so great! Employees are extremely polite and every time I show up the restaurant is clean. Best burgers!"}
{"text":"I will be honest. Nothing special about this place other then it's cheap. I tried it for the first time tonight after work and eh. Nothing to die for, it was good and all. Just like any other burger place that's fast food, although it didn't seem like fast food... Nothing like Freddie's though or in and out. Just my opinion though. I had the onion rings and the char cheese burger (onions and pickles). Onion rings were little too greasy for me but they was good. Wish they would've asked me for some kind of dipping on the side. I'm not sure why we always have to ask :-/
Oh well.. I give them a  for a clean, nice friendly atmosphere.  I will go back when I'm really craving it lol."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Burger was excellent. Fries and onion rings were delicious and the side salad was really fresh. Great new addition to the community.
Enjoyed the atmosphere. Pepper bar and the selection is great. Definitely my favorite is a single cheeseburger with mustard, fried jalapeños, grilled onions and grilled mushrooms. I'm suddenly craving a Habit Burger."}
{"text":"great meal last night had regular burger and the green bean fries oh boy were they great.  the server was personable the smell just plain makes you hungry!!!  yup totally recommend this place i just wish we had one in Prescott!!!  if you go and you should. get the green bean fries whoop whoop good!"}
{"text":"Really Great Burgers! ! !     We stopped in as The Habit Burger Grill was identified as the Top Burger in the greater Las Vegas area.  I never believe those \"Best of . . . .\" titles because so often I've found they really aren't or the bar is set relatively low.

This looked like a burger joint with a limited menu. Counter where you order and lots of seating inside.  Very similar to In and Out Burger so I was prepared to not be impressed.  My mistake.

The burgers are delicious and made fresh to order. They have 6 burgers on the menu. I had the Double Charburger with cheese combo (Mayonnaise, pickle, fresh tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions on a toasted bun) which was a killer burger - good size, excellent taste, reasonable price.  The Boss had the single Charburger.   Fries were crispy, nice sized, good tasting and not soggy or oily.  We each had a handmade on the spindle shake.   Really a very good burger meal.  I'm a big eater, but the one Double Charburger was more than sufficient to fill me up.  Good value for the dollars spent.

They also have 6 different sandwiches, 6 different salads, onion rings, sweet potato fries and even sundaes. There is also a kids menu.  The place was busy, very clean and orderly. The staff was constantly running out from behind the counter to wipe things down and clean things up. They were friendly and surprisingly engaging.

Hard to believe a great rating for a chain burger joint, right?  Better than In and Out. Better than 5 Guys. Better than Fuddruckers. Better give it a try! ! !"}
{"text":"Not very crowded. Service was quick. Cashier very pleasant. There were chairs/tables fronting area so watched them cook and serve. Restaurant was clean. Fountain drinks were self serve. There were self serve condiments of spicy peppers, ketchup, salt/pepper etc.
The burger was delicious.  It had mayo, tomato and lettuce. Will be back when in the area as Hawaii does not have Habit Burger yet. Hopefully soon"}
{"text":"Yummmm!!!  I had the the double char burger with everything, and it just hit the spot. It had a great yum factor. The staff was super friendly & accommodating with just 10 minutes to closing!  So, thank you!"}
{"text":"Well we had this a while back and I'm just now writing the review.  This place is really good food at decent prices.  The people here were friendly and the food was amazing.  I had the tri tip sandwhich and hubby had a burger. Just a really great atmoaphere. Loved it."}
{"text":"In the heart of midtown Phoenix, this tiny place serves up killer charred burgers. The restaurant is one of those (order and come pick up) kind of places, so no servers, your food is ready when the vibrating device lights up and vibrates. I walk in and was greeted by a lovely employee who was ready to take my order. I ordered the BBQ bacon char burger with portobello mushrooms and avocado, and sweet potato fries with a medium drink. They also had different type of goodies like tempura green beans so I got me one of those. 

It took a little time, but for quality food I guess the wait is worth it. 

The taste was good. I think I may have had too many elements in my burger that I didn't taste the flavors but there also was too much BBQ sauce. The geek beans were very tasty and my favorite was the sweet potato fries. Surprisingly they were very crunchy for a sweet potato fries (which is A+ for me)

I will definitely come back here, as the food was delicious, and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"So far so good !! I got a chance to check it out on a \"dry-run\" type of day - where they had a limited menu and they haven't had their grand opening yet :) 

I had the Charbroiled Mushroom Burger, steak-like fresh French fries and a citrus green tea. All very good. Would have totaled about $10. Its from Santa Barbara and while I grew up in southern California - it's new to me, but I like it. In the style of other quality fast food burger joints like 5 Guys, Inn & Out Burger & dare I say Bobby's Burger Palace. I say it s worth a try.

It's in the Hughes Center by Bahama Breeze and Fogo De Chao - near the newer Starbucks and new Chipotle and Pieology. 

Staff was very friendly and helpful. 

Drop on in if you're in for a good fast food style burger. 

Happy Eating !"}
{"text":"Visited twice so far. 

- friendly service, always with a smile
- clean dining area
- simple menu, convenient buzzer when food is ready

Hamburgers are good. Fries are okay, I prefer In N Out fries more. I usually order salad tho. 

If you're craving hamburgers, good place to check out."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon the wife and I are sitting around and decide we'll try that new burger place we saw last shopping trip. We decided to place our order over the internet for pick up. Upon arrival I saw that parking was horrendous but honestly c'mon folks just walk it's not that bad. When I entered the restaurant it was extremely busy so I figured \"great my food will be cold by the time I get some help.\" Couldn't have been more wrong! Not only was my food fresh off the grill, but the service was much faster than expected for how busy they were. The customer service was excellent and the restaurant was clean although I didn't stay to eat so I'm not sure about the tables. My wife and I both agreed that the food was very tasty and was still warm when I got home which is awesome. I'm only rating 4 stars because I need to come a few more times and see if the service and food is as good as our first trip. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had Santa Barbara burger. Solid. Wife had mushroom on sourdough and she liked it. The manager expedited our Togo order because we go there early. If you order to go make sure they make it right away. Solid to good food, great service. Employees that genuinely care for the success of their new business. Refreshing to see as a business owner myself"}
{"text":"I had the habit today, I just love these tasty burgers. food is always prepared to order fresh and hot. there is a great staff in this location, I chatted with the managerfora couple minutes, superfriendly guy. he toldmeifi evernoticeanychange in the quality of the food to be sure to let him know. being from SantaClarita this place makes me feel right at home.  highlyrecommendit"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service can be pretty lousy at times.  They seem to have a lot of staff but no communication.  They regularly miss special orders changes and the staff definitely needs better customer service training."}
{"text":"Annoyed. They forgot my ranch sauce for my fried green beans and put cheese on my burger when I told them no cheese. Folks need to start paying attention"}
{"text":"Heard this place just opened and figured I'd check it out.  There thing is Char grilled burgers, I had the Santa Barbara   which comes with everything on it including Avocado on Grilled Sour Dough.
Had the onion rings, they were pretty awesome! They give you a pager to let you know your food is ready to be picked up at the counter, the place was busy but the service was spot on. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I finally tried The Habit Burger Grill today. While I can't see making a habit of eating here I will say the burger was a better quality than some other bugers from some other burger places.

For me, the measure of a burger is in the mushrooms. If mushrooms are an option on a burger you can bet thats what I am getting. And so the story goes today. I ordered a portabella char burger combo. It took a while for the burger to come up but the place was busy and the food is fresh. No harm. No foul.

Immediately, aside from the mushrooms, I am reminded of In N Out. The toasted bun with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and cheese are very reminiscent of the other California joint. It must be a California thing. The differences were in the sauce, the addition of the mushrooms and the thickness of the patty.  All in all, I think I enjoyed this portabella char burger more. It did not disappoint. At $4.95 (burger only), I am satisfied with what I received. And yes, the mushrooms were awesome.

The fries I got from The Habit today I liked more than In N Out fries. That isn't saying much though. I don't care much for In N Out fries. The fries at The Habit are neither steak cut or shoe string. Some where in between which works well for my taste. But in my fry basket I had burned fries, chewy fries and a few fluffy fries. They were inconsistent and under salted. I could skip them next time and not feel bad about it.

I appreciate the drink options on tap at The Habit. Not only do they have a soda machine but also an iced tea dispenser. Not just regular iced tea either. Regular iced black tea, iced citrus green tea and one other I can't recall at the moment. But I know there were three. I got the green tea for a change up from the standard black tea. It was so refreshing I now find myself wishing I had gotten a refill. Live and learn.

Again, I don't see myself making a habit out of The Habit. But I did enjoy my burger and would gladly come back for another. But they don't have a drive-thru and I am a man on the go. Or at least a man who doesn't want to park the car and prefers eating at home. Alone. In peace and quiet. From time to time I'll break out of that shell and when I do I may just stop in to The Habit Burger Grill."}
{"text":"This is a new burger joint and wanted to give it a go today! It was really good! I can usually tell by the fries how the rest of the food is going to be! Fries were so fresh and delicious! Loved the sandwich and the burger!! I will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Love this place burgers are always fantastic. Awesome quality. Customer service is amazing. One time my fries seemed a little over cooked then normal I let them know and they apologized and took them and brought me out another order that were perfect. They didn't question me or anything. I come here couple times a month and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I love the Habit and grew up with it in Southern CA most of my teen years. I am so glad they brought one out here! All of the burgers are great, the tri tip sandwich, even the . You cant go wrong and I recommend the onion rings. They aren't like crappy fast food onion rings, they are legit onions battered and fried. Not mushy, nice and crispy the way they should be!"}
{"text":"The habit is an 805 original. I went there ten years ago and the food is exactly as I remember it: amazing. Have a double char. Add avocado and get onion rings. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"This burger place is probably at the top of my list. I usually get the Charburger with no cheese and raw onions. Although I have never at inside at a table, when I arrive at home with my burger, the bun is not soggy at the bottom! Also, the burger is wrap to perfection and everything is just neat!! One of the best burger I have every had."}
{"text":"Excellent Burger.  As soon as I entered the restaurant I could tell this place was a well run burger joint.  The house was packed but only had a few people in line because their service is quick which is a big plus in my book.  

The menu is sweet and simple.  Easy to read and lays everything out for you.  All burgers come with caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Add cheese, bacon and other options for a few more cents.  They also have chicken options too.

I ordered a single char burger with bacon and made it a meal so I can test out their fry game.  It only took a few minutes before it was ready.  The burger smelled great and was very tasty,  the only thing I would change is to use crisp leaf lettuce instead of shredded.  The fries were hot and fresh.

I would definitely recommend adding this place to your regular burger rotation."}
{"text":"My experience with the actual food was 5 star but the one star goes to customer service. I ate dine in with them and me and one other went to the bathroom for no more then a couple of minutes and when I came back two of the crew members had thrown away our almost fully there burger and fries!! A simple mistake yes, but when I went to ask about it they brushed it off and laughed about it as if it was a joke. Pissed off, I took it to the manager and even he didn't seem slightly embarrassed for his careless employees. Got a new burger but not one sorry for any of the inconveniences. They even sat there and whispered and rolled their eyes. Not about the food... But about the way the employees carried themselves!!"}
{"text":"Char broiled burger.   Great flavor.   Tasty burger not a saucy greasy mess.  Very clean!  Excellent service.  Very enjoyable overall experience."}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about the product or the service, to be honest. Burger was dry, which I didn't know was possible? I ordered a burger that was supposed to be BBQ bacon, but I couldn't taste the sauce at all. Also, placed an online order, waited 20 minutes, then headed in. I arrived at the exact time my online order said it would be ready, but when I asked, it hadn't even been started yet. So I wound up waiting another 20 minutes while the made my order. Might as well have come in and ordered it to go at that point.

I know it's fairly new, but there's some fundamentals missing in the service and product here. I'll keep taking my dough to Five Guys, Smash Burger, etc. in the meantime."}
{"text":"Alrighty Yeeps! This is the first time that I have tried The Habit Burger Grill, and I must say that this is gonna be a Good Habit for me!

Located in the Crossroads Town Center, its not hard to find it. Just look for the little white flag that says Now Open! Parking is in a shared parking lot, so you may not find a close parking spot! 

The first thing you notice before you enter is the Open Seating area towards the left of the Entrance. The second thing I noticed is that when you open the door, you are automatically in line to order your meal. That is one flaw that I have noticed....So be prepared to stand outside if the lines are long. 

Other than that, It was a pleasant trip! The Order Takers were Pleasant, and Quick. My Meal came out in less than 10 minutes, and the food was pretty good, onion rings were hot, and my burger was neat, and tasty! Lettuce was shredded, not like some other places where they just place a big fat piece of lettuce on the burger. 

The Strawberry Limeade with Cucumber Slices was awesome! Although it does take a bit like Country Time Strawberry Lemonade...lol! 

Hmmm, What else can I say? Go try it for yourself!

{"text":"This place was surprisingly good.  other reviews indicated it was decent place so I gave it a try.  My burger was cooked right, tasted fresh and wad reasonably priced. There was a group consensus amongst those I brought that the burgers were tasty and a good value. It is difficult to find a good burger and higher price doesn't always translate to good food. Not so with The Habit. Burgers are good, selection is good, and price is fair. It will definitely be on my list of good burger joints from now on."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about Habit Burger from SoCal natives so when I heard one was opening in Tempe, just down the street no less, I knew I had to try it. This is the first Habit Burger location in Arizona, but there are plans to open two more locations in Chandler and Phoenix by the end of the year.

The line to order was long. It's opening week so it was expected. We waited about 15 minutes to place our order. During the wait time the staff was passing out menus and making recommendations. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Once we placed our order it only took about 5-10 minutes for our food to be ready.

We ordered the BBQ Bacon Charburger, The Chicken Club, sweet potato fries, and a half&half order of regular fries and onion rings. The burger prices here beat Smashburger by a mile. Only $2.95 for a regular burger, and our BBQ Bacon Burger was only $3.85. The owner informed us as we waited that all the burger patties are 1/5 lb. and cooked over an open flame. I asked my friend to rate the burger among In N Out, Smashburger, and Five Guys and he declared it better than 5G or SB, but not quite as good as In N Out. 

I got the Chicken Club sandwich without bacon (making it technically not a club) and it comes on toasted sourdough bread, with heaps of fresh avocado (see my pic), lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I love avocado in a big way so I chose this sandwich over the other non-burger options which include a veggie burger, a tuna filet, and pastrami. Avocado lovers can add it to any sandwich or burger for a $1. Cheese can be added for $.50. The sourdough bread was really tasty. The chicken had great flavor, but I was somewhat disappointed in how wimpy the piece of chicken was. The whole breast was thinner than one slice of the bread!

Of the three sides we tried I liked the onion rings best. Super crispy and nice size pieces, plus they give you a side of ranch. Regular fries were very good too. The sweet potato fries fell short though, just not much flavor at all. I didn't even finish them. Also I think they must use an off brand ketchup because it didn't taste at all like Heinz to me. I love my Heinz.

There are kids meals available as well as milkshakes and malts. They also offer a few different salads which I will be back to try. I will definitely be back for that Chicken Club sandwich too, it was super good!"}
{"text":"No drive thru but always friendly staff and delicious food.  I love the single or double charburger.  The location is kind of inconvenient with parking and a drive thru would have been pretty epic."}
{"text":"This place has the best fast food type burgers! The grilled onions are amazing. I always add avocado and love the whole grain buns they offer. They use Romaine lettuce on their delicious dinner salads. Their prices are so reasonable and their staff is friendly and helpful. Both times we visited we got our meals to go and they were excellent."}
{"text":"Thank you to The Habit for coming to Las Vegas. I was the 8th customer through the door on opening day. Normally I would avoid a restaurant on opening day, but I broke that rule, because The Habit is just that good.

I ordered the Double Charburger with fries and a drink. The team had it prepared quickly. My first bite into the burger was inspiring. It was delicious. The burger was juicy and flavorful, with just the right bun to burger to topping ratio. It was seasoned just perfectly. 

The fries were cooked just right. They are nice and meaty, with a light salting to bring it home.

If you are nearby (or not) swing on in, it is worth the stop."}
{"text":"It's ok. It's a good burger. They think more of their food than I do.  And there's an operational problem as well...

1)  I understand \"up-selling\", but these youngsters manning the cash registers seem unable to or cannot comprehend someone doesn't want cheese. Seriously. It's a problem. Back off. God forbid a vegan shows up...

2)  The whole Habit system is based on a beeper/pager (which always struck me as super-impersonal; call my name!). When your food is ready, INSTEAD of calling your name, they beep you. That's supposed to be efficient, right?

The problem is, to a greater or lessor degree, the food sits alone, on an island, waiting for a Habit attendant to buzz the patron, when the order is ready. Which should be ready when I see it!!!!

See photo attached: from the time the burgers were first put up, on the island, it took almost 3 minutes to \"finish\" the order, fries for sure, I don't know what else. 

But I do know this: THREE MINUTES THOSE BURGERS SAT THERE!! That is NOT efficient!  That, to me, is not acceptable. 
In fact, the best three minutes of those burgers lives just got wasted sitting on the island because the cook didn't bring up the order appropriately and at the same time. 
You might not ruin the burger in this manner but \"0ptimize\"?  No. Not optimized 

\"Hot off the griddle?\"  Habit is a pretty good burger.  Just have to figure out HOW to get a burger hot off the griddle at The Habit. 

By the way, the tuna sandwich is delicious."}
{"text":"Out of 1-100, I scored this 05/16/2018, Today -- photos attached -- THE BEST TUNA SANDWICH EVER!  Forget the very reasonable price, superb!  

* cooked perfectly!  Rare as requested;
* great flavor. Flavor is the key. 

Maggie helped at the counter, a consummate pro?  No. Just well-trained, friendly, smiling, helpful, everything an employer would want. 

And she remembered to ask me for preferred cooking temperature. I forgot and since I like it \"rare\", it's important. You know, she could've just had it cooked \"medium\", neglected my true temperature choice and let it go. But she checked, I'm happy!

The Habit advertises, \"sushi-quality\", but this expression has no real world food meaning. 

It's like when they say \"voted best buffet\". Who said? Who voted?  

I guess what it really means, what it's supposed to mean is it \"really good tuna\". AND IT WAS!!!  REALLY GOOD TUNA. See photos!

I don't like The Habit 'beeper alert system' they employ, but this was mid-afternoon and it was PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!  I watched it being made.  Sometimes your food sits there; sometimes it sits there BEFORE the beeper fires up. Quote me: The First 2-3 minutes when a burger is done is critical!

You're gonna pay $15 at Bluewater Grill for a sandwich not this good. I paid $7.15."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Burgers that are on par with 5guys/in n out/smash burger. You'll probably average about $10 a person for a meal. I had the original double char meal which was $9.30. The double char comes with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, and pickle plus an American cheese. 

I tried this place out in California on a trip. I enjoyed it so much I had it again on the way back. I was stoked to see it was coming here! This will be my go-to place for a really good burger."}
{"text":"For 2 burgers, and order of frys, an order of onion rings and a large drink the bill was only $15. Pretty decent. Its a step above fast food burgers but by no means a gourmet burger. I ordered the burger with pineapple and terriyaki sauce. The pineapple had little flavor, and same with the sauce. Though it wasn't horrible.

The place is very very clean and the staff was extremely nice. 

The hubs and I will venture back in here again for sure."}
{"text":"Boom! Now this is the way it should be done. 

My family was in town, and we met here since the reviews were good. I can see why! The place was spotless. Super clean and modern looking inside. We placed our order and found a large table that easily sat the 7 of us. I had to try out the strawberry limeade that was available next to the soda machine. It was just right. Not too sweet, and not too tart. Good choice.

My daughter got a chicken sandwich that looked awesome. Our burgers came out perfectly, and were wrapped neatly in paper. The burgers were juicy and flavorful. We shared all of our fries, which were perfectly crispy. 

The staff was friendly, kept things stocked and clean. This is definitely a place that I can't wait to come back to again soon. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I am so happy that this opened up near my house. Yay! I just love their food. Always hot, fresh and yummy. 

When we first discovered Habit, we got their burgers. Really good stuff. But then we changed it up and started getting their chicken sandwich. The grilled chicken on their wheat bun is just perfect. Juicy and flavorful. It is big enough that my husband and I can split one and an order of fries and be full. The chicken piece is larger than the bun!

This location is always clean and well stocked. The staff is really focused on detail here, and very friendly. We both really like their condiment bar as well."}
{"text":"I went here because of a friend's recommendation. I ordered the honey glazed bacon chicken sandwich, at first I doubted my order but when I  took the first bite it blew my mind so glad I ordered it. Will be going back for more. 
The atmosphere is nice and clean and the manager approached us to ask if everything was alright. Really appreciate that."}
{"text":"Pretty good burger joint. Hard to find a reasonably priced place. Yeah it's fast food, but they do have some healthier options, and they have a pretty good process in place."}
{"text":"Good place to check out if you like burgers. I had the original with raw onions and it was very tasty. Hot and fresh when the order came out."}
{"text":"Tried out the new location and the food was awesome. Ordered the grilled chicken sandwich on a seeded bun, Fries and the strawberry lemonade.  I don't usually eat chilled sandwiches but I loved the one here.  Very fulfilling and I definitely will return.

The staff is also very nice and pleasant.... Clean environment too."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but customer service was absolutely horrible. How can fast food workers want $15/hr when they cannot get a simple order correct, or even have the ability to correct their mistake in timely fashion. Unreal!"}
{"text":"I believe this is the first Habit in Vegas. Coming from LA, I had to have it as my first meal when arriving. The service was the best service I've received at a Habit. It was also very clean and the workers are constantly walking around and making sure the place is stocked and tables are wiped. A burger will cost you about $3.50 and fries are about $2.00. Deff worth a trip for a meal to hold you over!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!  Just found this place today. We were told they have been open for about 6 months. Everything is fresh and made to order. I had the veggie burger on wheat, which was not even remotely dry (wow!) and the avocado made it more excellent. My friend had the Albacore sandwich (not breaded-yay!), which was firm, juicy and not fishy!  My daughter had the Chicken Cobb salad which was a nice size (not huge, not tiny) and the chicken was REALLY juicy also. My son had a double cheeseburger which tasted just like a fresh burger should taste. Moist but not too greasy. The bun was SUPER soft. Go for the sweet potato fries.  Also, All the nutritional info is on their website. The tuna sandwich is only 390 and the veggie burger is 470. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is so good, I don't know how I've never heard about it since it's been around 40 years in Cali! I love The Habit and it's hard to stay away! :)"}
{"text":"Way better than McDonalds but no drive through. Do not try their veggie burger. Look ingridients  online nothing healthy indeed!"}
{"text":"Love this place for me it beats chuck box, in n out, smash burger, five guys, about the only place it can't touch is maid-rite.  The onion rings are Devine.  I'm not a big fry person but the wife likes the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie burger eith onion rings. It was really tasty and eell-seasoned. I took a chance and went through the drive-thru and the service was pretty fast. I will return and try another one of their many combos."}
{"text":"Our first time to The Habit burger. The food was awesome, the staff was great, and they blessed our whole family with free lunch! We'll be seeing you guys again soon. Thank you Habit burger!!!"}
{"text":"Don't think this place is clean. I had a charburger with sweet potato fries and one of the juices from here. 10 minutes after eating I had the worst stomach cramps ever!!! Won't be returning here!"}
{"text":"Great food great service. The food here is awesome and has wonderful flavors. The service is great and the staff makes sure you are taken care of. Definitely recommend this place. Everything is cooked fresh and hot. You can get full quick here. Their burgers are huge and satisfying."}
{"text":"We decided to give Habit Burger a try as it was Labor Day and pretty much everything else was closed. Walked in to a clean restaurant and a warm greeting from Sydney. We ordered a couple burgers and drinks I couldn't decide between onion rings and sweet potato fries, she said I could do half and half which had me stoked. My mushroom burger was on point. I would put it a notch above In and Out which I LOVE. Mostly because it was variety and not your standard burger. The chocolate malt, well the two sips of it I got before it was destroyed by my partner in food crimes was legend.....wait for it....ary. The onion rings were the best I've ever had the sweet potato fries were soggy and bad. Sydney offered to swap the half order of bad fries for a full order of rings- survey says, YES PLEASE! She came and cleared our plates, and was waiting when we got up with a to go bag for the leftover peppercini's I was taking home. Habit burger you've got a great employee in her. And we'll be back."}
{"text":"I went to habit to redeem a free char burger with cheese I had a coupon for. Though this process was difficult because the terms and conditions is the coupon were not clearly explained they satisfied my order with no complaint and was very nice great burger too"}
{"text":"The Habit never disappoints! I am ecstatic that they have opened a location in Henderson. Great food, the best service and socially responsible, raising both awareness and funds to end hunger in our community."}
{"text":"Great service and food. I love the Santa Barbara and well done French fries. This is my favorite fast food burger restaurant in town and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Perfectly crafted burgers with the perfect condiments to go with it - from the shredded  lettuce, sesame seed buns to the various pepper bar. Their French fries are always perfectly cooked with the right amount of crispness. For a \"fast food\" burger joint, everything is always so fresh and made to order!"}
{"text":"I loved the food. Had the grilled chicken sandwich and onion rings. The chicken sandwich was delicious and not to difficult to handle. The onion rings were perfection. The onions did not slide out at all. 

I feel like this place was a little pricey. I know burger places are trendy but I think $18 for a faster food restaurant is a little pricey. 

Drink selection for non-soda gets the star off. The tea options were not great. Ended up with a fountain lemonade which is never as good because it's fountain. 

For a chain burger place, this was great. For never having been to the Habit before, I found it clean, well lit and great tunes!"}
{"text":"I love the habit and this is the best habit I've ever eaten at. I ordered a charburger with mushrooms and onion rings and it was delicious. The onion rings were cooked perfectly and the burger was really good. We went inside and ate, no wait time, and got our food very quickly. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were all very friendly."}
{"text":"Food & service are 5 stars at this location! Staff is very welcoming and double check quality and accuracy of orders! Great place to get your grub on."}
{"text":"I had to update my review from 4 stars to 5.  The last couple of months they have really stepped up the lobby cleanliness and service.  The food is consistently amazing.  I joined their habit club email group and now get some really good specials."}
{"text":"Growing up in Santa Barbara I've been telling every  one on the In N Out bandwagon in az about The Habit for years. Santa Barbara is home to the original one. Thank you Habit for bringing me a little piece of home to AZ. The burgers are so good, the Malts and the albacore sandwiches man. Mouths watering now. People in California don't really go to In N Out  that much. Az is way behind the times in this regard. Do yourself a favor and eat The Habit!

Food: the ones in Santa Barbara are better. The burger didn't have the same char flavor and has a little on the salty side.
Establishment: nice looking, on par with all the other trendy burger places. Definitely like the old school walk up ones back home better.
Overall: B+"}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this burger place. Dine in at 1:00 pm on a Friday, was busy  but well staffed keeping the wait to completely tolerable. Ordered the double cheeseburger and fries. Super hot burger and fries!! Bun sorta fell apart, but that won't stop me from eating here on many more future occasion! Highly recommended..!"}
{"text":"The food was OK but the service was horrible. They Made a mistake on my order when I brought it to their attention they question me and glared at me like I had done something wrong. They proceeded to inspect my order to make sure it truly was made incorrectly the first time. After they brought it back to me, There was no sorry about that just Lindsay handed me my food saying here you go. After that I proceeded to get glares from her even when I walk past her to get a refill. Not very friendly customer service there."}
{"text":"I'm shocked by the good reviews this place has.  Their burger has to be one of the worst ones I've ever had.  It literally had NO FLAVOR!  I had a bbq bacon burger with grilled onions, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo but none of the flavors stood out and all I could taste was the bun.  It was so bland.  Also, there were way too many people working.  I think I counted 6 people yet it still took a good 15 mins to prep my to-go order of 2 burgers, fries and onion rings.  I feel like it was a waste of $15.

The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because everyone working was friendly and their fries and onion rings were decent.  I don't know if I went on an off night or what but I'm seriously shocked people like this place.  Soooo many better burger joints around."}
{"text":"First time here and it was a really good lunch! The restaurant was so clean and the staff was kind and professional as well as being totally put together. I got the # 1deal which is cheaper than in and out and actually quite better. The wait wasn't very long at all and I was even offered a free ranch which I love! All in all the food was very fresh and they even have a little pickle/jalapeño bar so you can add on extra trimmings if you would like. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone shopping at the mall or just stopping by cactus and Tatum"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the excitement is about this place.  The burgers are a slight improvement over the likes of a Carl's Jr.  The fries taste and look like those out of a frozen bag at the grocery store.  I was expecting a unique tasting burger  not over priced drive thru.

I'm not saying the food is bad it's just very .... Common.  But the cost is far above common and without some sort magical experience with every trip I can't justify a repeat trip."}
{"text":"I think the best thing about these burgers is the bread. It's so toasty and buttery and delicious. Half of a Santa Barbera burger is enough I think, very filling. Me and my co worker split one usually! So fresh tasting.

The Tuna burger is awesome and doesn't taste fishy at all, plus the onion rings are to die for. A+++

This location is very clean inside and the employees are seem very happy and polite."}
{"text":"So, I've been to The Habit numerous times and they are always so great about not messing up your order. I guess there's a first time for everything...and they royally messed up. They gave my daughter regular chicken nuggets instead of grilled like I asked for and she won't eat breaded stuff. Then, my husband's char burger ADD grilled onion & bacon had nothing but those two items on it.  see pathetic pic below.  No sauce, lettuce, tomato. The girl who took our order clearly wasn't listening."}
{"text":"Writing this review because of the Service I received yesterday at Habit Burger in Scottsdale. While ordering the gal interrupted me as I was speaking many times in order to get the order placed the way SHE wanted to take it and she was very SHORT and CURT doing so. Made me feel like she hated me for some reason. My coworker was buying me lunch for my birthday so I asked politly could she put them in separate bags, her response \"NO! We don't do that but I will!!\" I was like DAMN, did I kill someone in her family?  GEEZ!!!!!!  Service like that KILLS CUSTOMERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Habit Burger and I love the Food tremendously, but I think that location is DONE in my future!! BTW her name is Destiny.  She should not be working a Register with that kind of attitude, to be honest if I were the UNDERCOVER BOSS she would be fired!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hard to review. Because I have had great experiences and bad ones and there isn't any rhyme or reason. Sometimes it is good hot and fast. I like you can add jalapeño for free. It is a tad pricey but way better than say a Burger King. But other times it is super slow and your food looks burned but is luke warm. So it is hard for me to recommend this place because I don't know what version they will get. I once asked for new frys because they were cold. They looked at me like I had 3 heads. A few people have come in saying they made a phone or web order. I heard one complain it was taking forever and what is the reason to preorder. So I don't know take a shot if you want to. One little things no that stuck with me was I used the men's bathroom. It was fine. Clean. Except the sink. One of those auto faucets. After I got it to turn on out came a trickle of water. I gave up. I pray to God the employees have a working sink!"}
{"text":"I was missing The Habit after living in L.A. for 10 years. Imagine my joy when I discovered a Habit 10 mins away from me! Quality charburgers, excellent onion rings, yummy malt shakes keep me coming back for more. I honestly prefer The Habit to In-and-Out (Shh! Don't tell anybody!) The service is quick and polite. I'll become a regular to this Habit."}
{"text":"If you've been reading my reviews, I have a soft spot for the Habit since being a fan in California. 
I love their char cheeseburger. This ain't no Bachi burger or Stout, but it is one level up from In n Out and lower than the gourmet burger tier. 

I have however never been a fan of their fries. Seriously, they can really do something about it and up their game. I normally swap out the fries with onion rings. But I have often just ordered the cheeseburger and nothing else. 

Do it like Nike!!!!!

Char cheese burger- 5/5 
Teriyaki burger- 3/5 
Fries- 1/5 
Onion rings- 3/5 
Tempura green beans - 4/5"}
{"text":"Go when they are busy, there will be a wait but maybe the food will be better.  I gave them five chances.  First time in the food was the best burger I have ever had! Trip two was a dried out burger patty.  I complained and described the situation on my third visit and the burger was great again!  Trys four and five, without me saying anything were both times the burgers were terrible dry again... I have not been back since, although I do like the green beans but hey are not enough to bring me back"}
{"text":"I'm a California kid. Once I ate at my First Habit, my visits to In and Out almost seized. Everything here taste so fresh and crisp, I guess thats how I could explain it. My favorite is Teriyaki burger with extra pineapple, with a side of Tempura green beans. The staff is always on top of everything and very friendly. Come eat your brains out so we can make sure they open more in town!"}
{"text":"Dirty tables, no ice, no condiments.   All around a filthy restaurant.    On top of the slowness and rude staff."}
{"text":"OMG! This is not a locally owned venue!?! How could any self respecting person patronize such a place!?! Well, as it turns out, it's probably just for people whom enjoy good hamburgers more than the latest trend.

Yay! I'm a fan is right."}
{"text":"I visited The Habit for the first time yesterday and was happily surprised.  The cheeseburger was deliciously juicy and flavorful.  You better come with a big appetite because I found the burger to be quite substantial and filled with \"the works\"--lettuce, onions, tomato.  Everything tasted so fresh. Oh, and this place probably has the BEST strawberry milkshake I've ever tasted! made with real ice cream and topped with whipped cream, it was worth the splurge.  And the onion rings--very crispy and tasty (and I know my onion rings).

Everything was SO GOOD, and I'm looking forward to my next visit here!"}
{"text":"Best fast food burger ever. Consistent taste here as well as all other Habits. Friendly staff always. Love this place. So glad they came to AZ!"}
{"text":"It's a good burger ! The girl working the counter today was super nice and helpful . 
They did forget the grilled onions on my wife's burger but not a bad place to stop for lunch"}
{"text":"There are so many burger places littered throughout this city, all charging upwards of 10-15 dollars for a burger because the meat is grass fed, organic, or comes from some fantasy land that can only be accessible by white hipsters with beards. Then you have places like The Habit that do things the old school way. Or better yet, the easy way! The burgers taste great, the quality is consistent, and get this - the prices are actually cheap!

How is this possible, you might ask? Simply put, they don't feel the need to feed you the BS. Like In-N-Out, The Habit knows exactly what it's doing. There's no need to try to be all unique and \"ironic\" with your burger creations. Keep things simple, keep things cheap, and keep the quality high. It's an automatic recipe for success.

The Habit, despite being a fast food joint, offers burgers that are easily ranked right up there with some of the more upscale places you can find nearby. I usually opt for a single Charburger with fries, which is more than enough to fill up the average person. However, I intend to take things up a notch and try their Santa Barbara style burger during our next visit.

This is a place that offers a great no frills approach. No silly gimmicks, annoying trendy décor, or some desperate attempt to justify overpriced crap. It's simply just traditional burgers done extremely well. And judging by the business they get, I'm pretty sure that's what most people want.

On a side note, their chocolate malts are a great dessert, although I wouldn't recommend getting them until after your meal. They'll fill you up quite fast otherwise.

Does it exceed my love of In-N-Out? Not quite, but it's pretty damned close!"}
{"text":"This Habit location opening in West Valley is long overdue. If the mood strikes for one of their char burgers, my girlfriend and I previously had to venture all the way out to Glendale and 7th Street. 

After dining here on a couple of occasions, I've found that the quality is pretty consistent with what I've come to expect. Although after reading some of the other reviews, it sounds as if they still have the quality control issues to iron out. 

In my previous review of their Glendale location, I raved about how they are one of the few fast food burger chains that actually \"gets it.\" Keep the menu simple, the quality of the burgers high, and the prices low enough to where they're not insulting. And make no mistake about it, for the price you pay, Habit makes a pretty damned good burger. In fact, even their malts and shakes are worth a mention for those rare times that I feel that my stomach can handle one in addition to the food.

I typically play it safe and just order a regular char with fries. I've experimented with their Santa Barbara style variation with mixed results. The portabella char was fine, but I still think their basic char is the best way to go.

Is it the best? Honestly, I don't think anyone will ever be able to top In-N-Out if you're sticking to fast food-level burger criteria - but the fact that I'm giving them a solid four stars says a great deal.

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Another upgraded chain burger joint...

I checked out Habit because I heard they had a veggie burger. I stopped in mid-shopping on a Saturday afternoon. Loud pop music and perky staff. I ordered a veggie burger (which was more expensive than a beef burger) on sourdough with cheese and avocado added, with fries and a drink. The cashier, while very sweet, seemed a little flustered and confused with the ordering system.  As I waited for my order, I poured myself an iced tea. They have a great unsweetened tropical iced tea. 

I waited a good 10 minutes before my number was called. I noticed my burger didn't have cheese like I ordered. I took it back and they cheerfully fixed the order and brought it back to me with the cheese. I checked the receipt and noticed that there wasn't cheese on the order, so the fault landed on the flustered cashier. 

The burger itself was tasty but nothing extraordinary. All the ingredients were fresh tasting and of decent quality. I highly recommend ordering the sourdough. It complemented the veggie burger perfectly. I was annoyed that the avocado wasn't distributed evenly. If I'm paying a few more bucks for upgraded fast food, I expect a little more care be put into assembling. The first half of my burger was brimming with delicious avocado flavor but the second half barely had any. The fries were good. Not fresh cut or anything but nothing to complain about.

If I'm in the area, I would stop by again for a quick lunch, but I would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick dinner. Place wasn't that crowded. My fries were STALE! like really really STALE. Burger was good."}
{"text":"This place is definitely delicious! The 4 stars in mainly because of seating and size of the burgers.

I ordered the Santa Barbara with fries and my fried had just a normal burger with onion rings.

The SB is super delicious! I love anything on toasty bread, so a definite plus! The only gripe was that I forgot it was a double patty... because one of the patties was only a half of one. Other than that, really delicious, love the fresh avocado!

Fries are really good; they have a delicious crispy texture and they give you a good amount of fries. 

Onion rings are insanely delicious! Dip them in ranch, along with your fries, and really everything and you have yourself a party!

The ranch is actually something to write about, its soooooooo creamy and delicious! Ask for it!

The strawberry limeade is RIDICULOUS! So flavorful and amazing!

The only downside was the seating, it gets busy, so you have to get what you get. We had to sit in the high booths; if you're short like me, its uncomfortable because your legs just hang and your circulation gets all screwy, and when you get out you fall and everyone looks at you. JK on the last part ;)

Come here and eat!

Yay!"}
{"text":"Hmm, I have mixed thoughts about this place. Sadly, the people that I went with hyped it up so much that I think I had too high of expectations. I personally love five guys and in-and-out burger has their moments, so, those two places were the ones that I compared my burger with.

Overall, it is a damn good burger and I demolished it, however, IMO, it wasn't as good as five guys. Five guy's burgers are a hell of a lot more greasy and sloppy, which is sometimes a good or bad thing depending on what kind of person you are. Sadly, I like it when my burgers are greasy and messy. The habbit burger didn't fall apart and didn't seem greasy at all. It had good ingredients and it def hit the spot. I would have no problem going back. However, as of right now, I would still rank five guys higher. Just saying...

This battle of the best hamburger is never ending. To be continued..."}
{"text":"The service here was \"ok\", and the food was \"ok\". Mediocre you can say. It was very packed but we were not completely sure why! Looks nice in the picture but our overall experience was an alright one. The burgers were very dry, fries were soggy... what a bummer!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on The Habit while driving around, looking for a new place to go for lunch. The parking lot was full and the line was long, so I figured it must be good. 

It took me a while to navigate the line, but I ordered my burger and fries, and they give you this pager thing like you get at restaurants, which lets you know your food is ready. It's  good system, because it gives you a chance to grab your drink and pick a table. The first couple times I went I had a bacon cheeseburger. I really liked the flavors, the bun is delicious, and the fries are really good. Very crispy which I like.

As you're ordering, you can see them grilling the meat on an open flame, and you can also watch them put together the orders. They clearly strive for quality, and it shows. Their charburgers are really good. 

I look at this like a better In-and-Out with more options. The grilled buns and American cheese remind me of In-and-Out, but you can also get bacon, mushrooms, a couple kinds of cheese etc. They also have healthier options, including salads and grilled chicken sandwiches (the grilled chicken is great).

I'm glad I found The Habit, because it's become a regular lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"They screwed up our whole order. Toppings were incorrect and the order was wrong for our takeout. Sadly didn't check until we got home so unless we drove back nothing can really be done about this. Save money and go to in and out burger or McDonald's"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the BEST burger in town!!!Everything is delicious at Habit, their fresh quality charburgers, definitely try it with mushroom, golden chicken sandwich, Cobb salad is so yummy, and their sides are delicious, healthy & fresh. The restaurant is very clean and very helpful friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Everything was great, from the food to the cleanliness of the place and friendly service. Fresh, delicious, quality burgers, lots of sides, their sweet potatoes, green beans , onion rings are just great! Lots of delicious options...charburger with mushrooms, Cobb salad, golden fried chicken sandwich ....the best burger in town!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the best burger in town!!!
Their charburgers are fresh, well seasoned and juicy, great side options....crispy onion rings, green bean tempura is delicious, sweet potatoes and many more...love their Cobb salad. The place is very clean, polite & friendly staff. And affordable prices!!!"}
{"text":"The Habit is easily 4 stars for me and I was trying to sift through some of the bad reviews to see why others felt different .. Compared to other places in the same category per se; The Habit has fair prices, menu variety w chicken and salad options, friendly staff (Heather is great), always clean and their food is much more fresher than many places I've seen and been too.  Some of the poor reviews on here have suggested getting McDonald's or Whataburger instead which to me is laughable. This location does have a drive thru and although I don't think that was very smart because it's not your typical fast food joint so times will run slow I'm sure (I've never tried) but I wouldn't ding them on that - No different if Smashburger or Shake Shack decided to run a drive thru, I'd expect slow times. Overall, The Habit is a solid place w really good food; I've been more than 10x between here and 7th Ave Phx location and have nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"The fries were really good, the burger was ok nothing that stood out to me.  The service was friendly and quick enough."}
{"text":"The Habit Burger has always been one of the best in Phoenix, but, with the addition of the Hatch Chile Burger, it has graduated to the best!  I am from New Mexico and am always looking for restaurants that cook with great New Mexico Green and Red Chile.  Today was my first experience this new offering from Habit and it was fantastic!  Since I am sort of a purist when it comes to green chile,not chili, burgers, I would suggest you try it without the chipotle salsa, swiss cheese and mayonnaise and opt for American Cheese and raw onions with mustard.  MmmmmmMmmmmmmMmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Never can go wrong with a#2 char broil cheeseburger  meal deal the best!! So glad when this place came to town!! Love it"}
{"text":"Is 3 stars not bad, but not that great?!  I went on  a Sunday and it was pretty busy. The burgers were ok, nothing special. I really liked their sweet potato fries and the option of protein style. Their service was fast and great. They shouldn't put too much mayo on their burgers."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers here! 
However, the fries are lackluster and they only have American cheese so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Wow,super underwhelming. I read several reviews and was looking forward to a great burger, it didn't work out that way.
Starting with the positive:staff was very friendly,it was very clean and there was a nice selection of ice teas.
I ordered the #2 double char with cheese,fries and drink for $9.30. The fries were straight from freezer to fryer with zero seasoning,very bland. The burger was just soooo average. The top bun was falling apart immediately. It just really brought nothing to the table.
You can find a much better burger in several dive bars on the east side for less dough."}
{"text":"3.5 stars really. I am not a huge char broil fan, but I enjoyed my bbq bacon burger. Kids liked chicken sandwich and burger better than smashburger. 1 kid liked smashburger fries better. Both kids said smashburger shakes are better. The habit seems to be less expensive than smashburger but I don't know if they are the same size patties. I give the nod to The Habit for affordability and breadth of menu options over 5guys and smashburger."}
{"text":"Very clean, nice people behind the counter. Food looks fresh and smells great. Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant. The food isn't bad pricing aswell as super tasty, and the service is fantastic. Kirkland was very helpful and super attentive and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The burgers were fine. The sweet potato fries were lame, really soggy. The kids meal came with a cute gummy burger that our daughter loved but when she went to eat her apples they were moldy. I went back to get new ones and they didn't even say sorry. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in with the free burger coupon. I was surprised upon entering how loud the music was, I couldn't hear my daughter talk to me at all. Went up to order and got a side of the garlic fries, tempura green beans and sweet potato fries. My daughter ordered nuggets. My daughter loved her food which was just enough to cover her hunger. I was disappointed though because the garlic fries I got were cold, and the tempura green beans were burnt. I went to try and get them exchanged and they gave me onion rings. I would have rather been at In and Out but my daughter enjoyed it so that is what it is a 2 out 5! There is not enough seating either."}
{"text":"Best I can do for this is 3 stars. Small storefront place, tight on space and parking. Fries were good, not great. The charburger with cheese was okay but the meat lacked flavor. There are a bunch of burger places nearby that I'll patronize rather than this location, it didn't wow us at all."}
{"text":"It's lunch time I want a burger and my lunch crew wanted to try this spot... I had been to the other one so I am always up for trying a different local... We entered the restaurant it was so packed not a free table in site... The staff I must say was so friendly and kept asking if we needed anything after we snagged a table just by luck... I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Charburger and an order of fries... I rate the experience as followed.

Mushroom Swiss Charburger - B
Fries - C+
Staff - A+

I am still not really impressed enough to change my burger spot... But it will work as a great change every so often."}
{"text":"I was seeing all the great things about this burger spot and had to try it... I arrived to a very packed and busy restaurant the line moved fast. Came up to the counter to order and I went with the Double Charburger with Sweet Potato Fries and an order of French Fries. It was really impressive how fast the food did come out. This Place seems to be a place for families and kids they were running all over. I rate the food as followed.

The Habit Double Charburger B+
Sweet Potato Fries B
French Fries D+ 

It was a nice change in burger spots but will not make me change my #1 burger choice."}
{"text":"This is a new place and never expected it to be good. It's sit down restaurant quality similar to Red Robins. The lady that took our order asked what type of fries we wanted and I chose 2 different ones and when our food was delivered we never got the other. I went to the manager and she simply said she will bring it to me. She personally handed us 2 fresh batch. Great service! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place was ok. The burger itself wasn't the best burger I'd had, but not the worst, either. What made it better were the toppings; very fresh, delicious, and full of flavor. The fries and onion rings are also very tasty, and I love the iced tea options.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Customer service sucks, I called to make a pick up order for 10 people they asked me they can't take the order over the phone I have to go in and place the order THEN come back and pick it up when ready. Are you serious, please tell me what the difference is and that takes away the purpose of a pick up order! Thanks for a waste of time."}
{"text":"Shockingly great salads for a burger joint. I mean there burgers are good too, and I look forward to trying the veggie burger. If I had to describe the style of burger, I would say gourmet Burger King, it has similar flavors, which isn't bad, it just tastes like a higher quality Burger King burger. The fries are great too, but seriously, the salads are shockingly good, I would go just for the salad, if I'm being honest with myself."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been fantastic, from the charburgers to the fries, to the chicken sandwiches and sundaes. Love it!"}
{"text":"Finally The Habit is in Las Vegas!!! Worth the wait and yes the hype is real about this place! I love the burgers and the onion rings! Nothing here is greasy and the quality of food shows as well! I usually get the double char which is similar to a double double at in-n-out! The food is made to order and the staff is on top of things! Even though this is a soft opening today, things seem very organized! Good food and great service! If your looking for a burger place that serves good food,this is your place! I also love the variety! Salads, tri-tip, chicken, and much more! More locations are coming to Las Vegas! The next location will be Blue Diamond and Decatur. Opening sometime at the beginning of 2016. 10-15 locations in the future!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times and have never been disappointed. 
My favorite is the veggi burger and tempura green beans but have been known to admire the burgers and onion rings. The fries are also served crispy. 
The Ranch is really good too and they have a variety of flavored teas and the standard soda choices. 
Prices run between 6-8.00 

Service has always been friendly and restaurant is kept stocked and clean."}
{"text":"This place just opened up and you can tell the workers are still kinda getting into the rhythm of things but service was on point and the place was very clean. Wife and I got burgers and tempura string beans (which were awesome). The fries are nothing special but that's ok. You could definitely tell they use fresh ingredients. I hope they can keep their food quality and friendly service consistently high. You really do get good value for your money here. I'm gonna try the albacore tuna next time!"}
{"text":"I went once for to-go and the burgers are better than average. I got very little fries in the order but since I've only gone once. I'm unsure if that's their regular portion or if I was less than lucky that time. It's hard to judge to-go because I feel like fries are always more soggy when it's to go. And their fries are chunkier than I usually like. I might try them again though because they seem to be worth the chance of going again."}
{"text":"I was craving a good cheeseburger and that's exactly what I got!  And hot, salt fries.  Yum!  Lots of selection on the toppings for your burger.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've always heard of The Habit but never tried. Boy was that a big regret. Awesome service, delicious food, high quality. 

The patties are a great size, which is unbelievable when you look at the prices. I was originally thinking that the burgers would be small because a regular Char Burger with cheese is $3.85. I couldn't believe that a burger, plus all the fixings, would be that cheap, but it was! 

An original Char comes with tomato, lettuce, caramelized onions, mayo, and pickles. I ordered mine without the onions and was pleased with the result. There was a lot of lettuce, but since it was shredded it wasn't a big distraction. Their fries are also crispy and crunchy, but not rock hard. And their onion rings! Delicious! Also crispy and easy to bite into (as in: you don't take one bite and the whole onion comes out). On another visit I had one of their strawberry shakes, and it was also very good. It was pretty thin and I was surprised at how fast I drank it. 

The girl that took my order was super nice, too. I didn't order a drink but she offered a water cup. And then when I picked up the order, another girl offered ranch with my onion rings. I'm not sure if those questions are mandatory, but either way, it was nice. 

I'm glad that I went to The Habit. It was a great experience and the food was great and very cheap."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I absolutely wouldn't come back here for anything, even if it was free.

We went through the drive thru for lunch on a Saturday around 12:00. It wasn't busy at all, so that should have been my first clue. We ordered 3 burgers, 3 fries, 2 drinks, and a kids meal with applesauce. We got home and unpacked just to find that we are missing an adult burger and the applesauce.

That is absolutely unacceptable to me. The drive thru should have checks and balances in place to catch mistakes. I shouldn't have to drive 4 miles home only to have to come back to get the food I paid for.

As for the food, it wasn't good. The burgers were over cooked, the buns soggy, the fries cold. The burgers are really, really small. Think McDonalds $.99 cheeseburger small. I was surprised to see that the meal was $8 for what you get. It's more of a $4 meal to me. I can't imagine why anyone would come to Habit when there's an In-n-Out just down the way. The food there is delicious, HOT, and fresh. Not to mention the fact that you'll actually receive the food that you pay for in the drive thru. It's also a lot cheaper. Go there. This place sucks."}
{"text":"My picks:

Mushroom Swiss Charburger on Sourdough
Fresh Albacore Tuna on Wheat
Onion Rings with the Habit's Fresh Ranch
Chocolate Shake

Plus I love that the owners give back to the community through grand opening events and fundraisers!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Really average. It doesn't come close to In-N-Out or Five Guys. Carl's is better to me. I guess the quality and service is above average but I'd rather have a Del taco burger."}
{"text":"They need a little more meat in their patty.

This restaurant was near empty and had a full staff and was the filthiest dining area I've ever seen.

I let the manager know that their website didn't show this location.  Perhaps HQ has the right idea.  I mean this place was dirty.  Outside was clean, the kitchen looked clean, but the dining area was so bad that I'll not go here again.  Maybe I'll try the one on Cactus or FLW.  Better zip codes."}
{"text":"Is it a burger day?  This place makes a mean cheeseburger. They're juicy and cheese is melted perfectly. The lettuce is fresh and the pepper bar yummm. 

The fries are good but green bean fries are my favorite. 

When I'm in a burger mood this is my favorite place. I hear the chopped salad is good however, I always end up with a burger."}
{"text":"Great burger with good flavor right off the grill and the staff is very friendly.  I will defiantly come back"}
{"text":"Well right when I moved to AZ I asked my boyfriend (who has lived here his whole life) to take me to In-N-Out since I heard their burgers were great. BLECH. Talk about  mediocre. So the next time I wanted a burger we came to The Habit and it was soooo much better! I love that their menu doesn't have a ton of options and every time we go they're super yummy. My favorite thing is the teriyaki charburger! Yum."}
{"text":"I had seen the menu for this place laying around at work and I had assumed that it wouldn't be very good because $2.95 for a hamburger?  Those are fast food prices!  They can't be good quality for that!  My co-workers assured me I was wrong but I took my time checking the place out.

That finally changed today when I decided I was bored of every other place I normally go to for lunch and a burger sounded good.  I walked in and was greeted right away (eye contact, smile, everything!).  The girl who helped me was friendly and patient as I took my time ordering since I hadn't been there before.  I ordered the Double Char with cheese and a side of fries to go.  As I was waiting I was happy to see some of the employees going around and wiping counters, sweeping the floors, just doing general cleaning which made me happy because a clean place that serves food is a great place!

My buzzer letting me know my food was ready went off pretty quickly but not so fast that I felt like they just grabbed my burger out from under a heat lamp.  The man who gave me my food (possibly the manager) made sure to relay my order back to me to make sure it was correct and offered packets of ketchup for my fries.  He made eye contact the whole time and was also very friendly.  Once I had my bag of goods I couldn't resist reaching in for a fry (or possibly two....) right away.  They were hot, fresh and perfectly cooked!  A nice crunch on the outside but still soft on the outside and the perfect amount of salt.  Once I bit into my burger I was equally impressed.  The meat was cooked about medium so nice and juicy, the cheese was oozing off the sides and the veggies were fresh and perfectly portioned to the burger.  I'm only a little ashamed to admit that I actually finished the whole thing (which is why my next stop after finishing this review is going to be the gym...) because it was so delicious.  I will definitely be making The Habit one of my habits!  Hehe I made a pun!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and onion rings! The drive thru is always slow, but the customer service makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Figure I tried this place and it was okay. Went in the drive thru, girl was very friendly and nice. She asked if I ever been here, I replied no. She informed me burger comes with mayo, pickle, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions. So I ordered double charburger minus grilled onions, add raw onions and mustard. Side sweet potato fries and green beans. When I got home, burger had cheese and no mustard.  Hate cheese on burgers!! So I called to make sure that it doesn't come with cheese or must ADD cheese. Lady told me u have to add cheese to charburger.  She did apologize on phone at the end of conversation so that was cool. I will give them a second chance. Maybe dine in next time, sweet potato fries and green beans were little soggy by time I got home but that's expected. Burger was fresh and I scraped off most of cheese."}
{"text":"Giving In& out burger arun for there money 
 Very  lean buger  juicy with more  menu choices like bacon and mushrooms .  Fries good and they have  malt vinegar!  Gets crowded at dinner time so you will have about10-15 minutes wait but very well worth it"}
{"text":"The service has really gone down at this location. We have been coming to this one ever since it opened as we live in the neighborhood. Last time we came in we noticed a new manager and new staff. I could tell things weren't running quite smoothly. Sure enough when we took our order home there were items missing so I wrote a review to that effect, but I don't believe it posted at the time. 
Today we came in again to find the same manager and crew and it took forever to get the order completed with the cashier. She would stop to keep asking other staff about the items we were ordering. The person behind us came up to another cashier and was able to get his order completed quickly. Then when we were picking up our order \"to go\" and we were almost given our food and then the girl realize none of our french fries or green beans were in the bag (which is now what I remember happening the previous visit). While we were sitting waiting for order to be called we notice the manager in the back frantically cooking orders, whereas the previous manager used to walk around friendly greeting guests and checking on the cleanliness of the operation. I guess im questioning the qualifications and ability of the staff as they have been here a while and should have it worked out by now. Does corporate not train or check in on these guys. Terrible representation if what used to be a swift and fun experience. I know for one I'm gonna be going down to McDowell location from now on to give it a try until this is fixed. (Spent $45 tonight and No Ranch dip for the tempura green beans)"}
{"text":"We've been here several times in the last year,  and have generally had a positive  experience. My BBQ bacon burger was great,  lots of flavor and cooked perfectly.  My 11 year old daughter had the chicken ceser salad,  chicken was cooked spot on and the dressing was very good.  The bun on  my wife's mushrooms Swiss charbroiler was hard and she said it tasted stale,  but the meat was cooked Ok. Sweet potato fries and onion rings were excellent as always,  but had to give 3 Stars due to the stale bun."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. This place sits right under Five Guys and In-N-Out on my list of favorite fast (fresh) food burger joints... It's a great burger, very fresh... but you don't have as many options and the fries don't even compare to Five Guys. I got the mushroom and swiss char... that's basically the extent of their burger options... and I thoroughly enjoyed it! But the whole time I was thinking I wish this burger had bacon and fresh jalapenos on it!!

Nice place, but given the choice I'm going across the street..."}
{"text":"While in Vegas my wife and I wanted something quick before a concert. The staff was very friendly. We had the Jalepeno Tempura Cheeseburger...yum!"}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered a kids char with no onions, my brother ordered a double char with bacon, I got his burger & he got a kids char with onions. Luckily we were going to the same place so we were able to correct our orders on our own. After scraping all onions off (and unfortunately most the cheese) I started to eat my burger...2 bites in I spit it out. THE BURGER WAS COVERED IN GRILL SCRAPINGS! You know the nastiness that they scrape off the grill, yeah, I got a mouth full of that! Nastiest thing ever!"}
{"text":"Love \"the habit\" food seems very decent and reasonably priced. They have really good salad options for a burger place especially better than some sitdown restaurants. Nice selection, we can always find something and that all of the kids will eat."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the Habit since I live only a couple miles away, but it was mostly disappointing for me.  I'm vegetarian, so I have no idea how their meat burgers taste, and they may be the best in the world for all I know, but the veggie burger was a tasteless lump for the most part.  I do give them kudos for having a veggie burger, but either put more effort into it, or take it off the menu and go full-on meat!

The service was nice, and I like the design of the place, but there are too many good veggie burgers to be had in the Valley to waste my time eating this one.  Parking lot is super-cramped, so if you need your meatburger fix, then don't come right at 12 or 6, unless you want to park in someone's yard."}
{"text":"Busy stop with wide range of young and old. There is a panera bread next to it. There is outdoor seating but no umbrellas for shade so no one was sitting outside.

Their specialty is the char-broiled burger. I found it pure and mild, so I'm so glad they have a mini pepper station and a condiment station with bottles of name brand sauces. Not salty or oily. I got it with all the toppings. Noticed no ketchup on it. There is caramelized onion confetti on it.

The mixed salad was pretty big for $4. It came with a big scoop of guacamole. Toppings and meats can be added to it."}
{"text":"Great burger (Double Char w/ cheese), and more importantly a great Albacore Tuna sandwich, made with a quality tuna fillet cocked medium, a huge difference from the other guys sorry frozen fish patties. The fries and onion rings were average. The environment looks and feel more upscale than other fast-foods with similar prices, and the service was friendly. It would have been a solid 5 stars if it wasn't for the fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and insuring that you have a great experience. My wife ordered the Santa Barbara and I had the Mushroom Char. Both orders with small drink and FF, under $20. The hamburgers were not greasy and the bun wasn't soaked in the juices. Everything was fresh and FF were piping hot. 
The staff is always cleaning the dining area and asking if there is anything else we wanted."}
{"text":"Another hamburger place has opened where Baja Fresh used to be.

For a Thursday night, there were a few patrons. The prices are OK and you can custom make your own char burger. But if you look at the burger, it's only about a 1/4 inch thick. My wife was smarter and ordered the double char burger which she custom built. I ordered the Bacon Char burger. We ordered both the regular and sweet potato fries which where a bit salty. We both enjoyed our burgers.

This place reminded me of Quizno which had the three different peppers that you could add to your meal at the condiment station.
The staff was friendly and of course the place was clean."}
{"text":"Okay I'll admit I'm pretty biased toward any place that offers free stuff. I'm talking about jalapeños, peperoncini peppers, and banana peppers! These and the fact that they have veggie sandwiches and chicken sandwiches aside from burgers makes me like it. 
Burgers are good, especially when mushrooms and grilled onions are added. Sandwiches are even better in my opinion. On the chicken sandwiches, you can choose between BBQ or teriyaki sauce (go for the latter!), and veggie sandwiches have honey mustard. I'll suggest sour dough, although it'll break apart and you'll end up eating it with a fork.
My boyfriend swears their ranch is the best, so we always get onion rings to go with it. Service is great, line moves fast. The place packs up during busy lunch hours, but there always seems to be plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joints.  Good friends live nearby and when I first moved here I saw a hella long line outside this place.  I was prompty told \"do NOT eat there.  You'll wish you didn't know about it. You're better off not knowing about it.\"

So, we went.  

What is better than a fresh char grilled burger? Not much. The place serves single, doubles, you name it. They also offer chicken sandwiches, but it's a burger joint so I opt for the burgers.  I always get the single with cheese and this is enough to fill you up, but not to where you feel gross after. That's what the fries, onion rings, and shakes are for. ;)

The burgers are perfectly cooked and not dry but not greasy.  The buns are toasted and slightly crispy around the edges.  Perfection. You can opt for a variety of standard toppings and they also serve speciality burgers with mushrooms (gross) and other options. I stick with the basic cheeseburger.

The fries and onion rings are crispy and delicious. 

The place gets packed at lunchtime, but the line moves quickly and you can have a seat while you wait for your number to be called.  

I kinda wish I didn't know about it.  This is my go-to for my friends' kids and they offer child portions, nuggets, etc."}
{"text":"The drive thru can be a long wait at times, but the food and service are worth it! 

The staff is very friendly and helpful. 

I've only ever ordered the chicken club meal from here, as it's my favorite, and they do it justice. 

There's so much avocado and bacon, the chicken is tasty, perfect for the warm months (I get the lettuce wrap with no mayo). 

I drive 15m out of my way at lunch to go to this location. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Went back just now, after great experiences in CA thought I'd try one more time and drive 15m out of my way. 

They messed up the order again! Once I get home the Chicken Club is missing avocado. Call the store only to be routed to a call center and was referred to their website. 

Now I know why people in front of me in the drive thru hold up the line to check their orders. I'll be doing the same- if I go back. 


Check your orders!"}
{"text":"My current diet limits what I can when going out. I had never been to this restaurant before and was apprehensive about pricing. However, the pricing is very reasonable and I was able to get a super food salad (which is huge) that perfectly fits into my diet. The staff was very friendly and the food came out quickly and was of extremely high quality."}
{"text":"This is the best burger and fries ever . Loved it so much wish we had one in OHIO. I got the double add bacon with fries"}
{"text":"It's not much better than a slightly nicer McDonald's or JitB.

Started with the (very corporate) order taker - seemed more interested in asking her prescribed, scripted \"order taking\" questions than offering this customer some service.

As soon as I stepped into the Men's Room, another \"corporate entity\" knocked on the Men's Room door in order to clean it.

Got back to my table and the onion rings are overdone. Haven't tried the burger yet. Cook and cooking staff in kitchen are yakking away (loudly).

Ugh....

Burger is only slightly better than JitB. But, it's cold.

You could cut the tension in the dining room with a knife! I feel like I'm not wanted here - at ALL. The workers all keep glowering at me.

And, I guess now that I'm here it just happens to be time for just about everyone to clean everything."}
{"text":"I was happy to hear there was a habit near my work. Too bad this one came with what I can only describe as bones.
I bit into my burger and immediately felt something hard that was not my charburger. Maybe I'll be back idk that was kind of gross.

Edit: I was contacted by a rep from Habit promising  to right their wrong but nothing ever came from it. I replied and never heard back. Guess they really have bad customer service even at corporate."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with The Habit Burger and I was very impressed. I wanted to give them a try when they first came to town and then they opened this location which is much closer to home. A win for me!

The cashiers were immediately greeting everyone arriving for lunch today and offering menus to help us all decide. The menu includes burgers, sandwiches, salads, starchy sides, and shakes. All of the burger and sandwich options sounded great. 

The dining room, drink station, and condiment area was immaculate. Employees were over the top welcoming and constantly cleaning the dining area. They were also checking in on diners and removing trash at the end of the meal. I hope they keep up the friendly service and cleanliness of the restaurant.

I ordered the Char Burger which comes with mayo, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, and caramelized onions. I added cheese and bacon. This really hit the spot for my burger craving and I loved the crispy bacon. The burger is partially wrapped in paper which really helped in holding everything together. The fries were okay. They were crispy, but not seasoned or anything really memorable. My husband really enjoyed his BBQ Bacon Charburger.

The pricing was more than reasonable. I would say that the prices were similar to a drive thru burger spot, but the quality and taste was much better."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Tempura green beans, fries, burger, and Santa Barbara burger were excellent...so was the chocolate shake for dessert.  We will definitely be back!!!  Good prices too."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great price, and amazing atmosphere.I go there any time I can.  It is really close to my office and I go there for lunch with my co-workers as often as we can get away.  The menu is easy to read and very easy to understand as well."}
{"text":"Better than Smashburger. Cant get enough of their onion rings and BBQ Burger. Give it a try, you will be back for more."}
{"text":"Great burger, clean location, nice staff. The single patty is enough for me- and the standard dressing is delicious. The food just tastes super fresh to me- nothing frozen. Price is right, and the fries are outstanding. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"A great burger made from quality ingredients and char-grilled. Make sure to add grilled onions! The fries are decent and onion rings are good. Prices are cheap, menu is mostly focused on burgers, chicken sandwiches, malts, and shakes. I've been to the Tempe and Phoenix locations (Glendale Ave) and both are clean, organized, with friendly staff. This location was pretty busy during lunch time but the line moved fast and there was still staff walking around making sure everyone's experience was proper. I love the pepper bar - extra jalepenos for me please! Everything is fresh, no frozen ingredients. Sort of reminds me of In N Out Burger (concept-wise with minimalist menus, fresh ingredients) but the taste is far different. I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This was possibly the cleanest restaurant I have ever eaten in. Food was fresh, hot and very good. Definitely will recommend for a quick lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Was looking for some cheap good eats and ended up at this local chain.  The employees were very nice and the food was good. Not amazing, but a solid place for a burger and fries.  Definitely would go back again if I need a quick meal but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. This is a nasty grease heap. I got so sick after eating here. Bad choice."}
{"text":"It's a hamburger sports bar, but it's a good one. I think the staff was a little overwhelmed on NY's day and the upcoming game, but they ralleyed and the food more than made up for everything. We had the animal fries and burgers. I loved my burger. They have some nice combinations. I'm glad they don't have one of these in my hood, but if anyone is in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"I grew up in SoCal and was basically weened on In & Out burger so I went in here with a bias. Ordered the Double Char, essentially their Double Double, Onion Rings, and a Vanilla Shake. Slightly different from In & Out but just as good. Plus, the Onion Rings were some of the tastiest I've ever had. I like that they also have salads and different sandwiches. 

Clean, stylish building and a great staff. Extremely helpful and friendly. 

I will definitely return especially it a short walk from my Vegas location."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up  and 5 's for sure for this place. First time here and the food and service is great. Will definitely be talking bout this place. Their menu is unique and an A+ for being one of the very few places that offers a great tasting hamburger wrapped in lettuce ."}
{"text":"I went last week during their soft opening and got a BBQ bacon char burger it was great, the meat was quite flavorful, fresh fries and the limeade was perfect (better than sonic imo) I'm quite picky so I thought they'd be a little annoyed with the things I wanted on and off the burger, but they were great about it and I had no issues."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled that we have a Habit in Las Vegas!  It has that same quality I remember from Santa Barbara with a modern twist.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, great prices. I've never had a bad experience here. I don't know what else to say really, but Yelp wants me to make this review longer...they have fries?"}
{"text":"Very good, but very busy. I wouldn't really want to eat inside again because it's a very busy place. However, it is good food for sure and the employees are very friendly and polite. We need about ten more locations around Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Their burgers are SO DELICIOUS. And their fries are super good too. Everyone in Vegas thinks In-N-Out is the best.. but they'll all change their minds real soon. So happy they finally have one here in Las Vegas :) and it's just as good as the ones I've been to in California. Always good service as well."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Flame broiled= juicy. Onion rings are perfect crispy. Modest prices for proximity to strip. Work nearby, will likely return."}
{"text":"First time at this location, but 3rd visit to a Habit. Great service, charburgers are awesome, affordable prices. The 5th star is missing, because two tables that we tried to sit at were slightly dirty (little pieces of lettuce and whatnot). People generally eat with no plates right out of the wrapper, so they should have an eye to clean the tables. Join their email club for a free burger."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my experience at the Habit. The first thing that you notice is the environment. It wasn't very busy when I went. It was extremely clean and multiple employees were working to make sure that the dining area was kept in perfect condition. The service was really considerate. The food was great! Me and my girl each got a double burger combe with fries and a drink and it came to 19 dollars, which seems like a fair deal for some high quality food. The burgers were good sized. The cheese was really good and the patties were well seasoned. The fries were really good. They were a little thicker cut than most comparable burger joints. Overall I was really satisfied and would definitely return for a chill spot to grab a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I waited a while before checking this place out due to it being a new establishment in this area, and constantly being packed. I have to say, it is a really good food joint. The staff they have there is very gracious and super helpful in helping you decided one what you want to eat. The suggestions were great, the place was immaculate for being constantly so busy. They are doing their part and i see this restaurant being a new staple in how we serve fresh, flavorful burgers in a fast food like design.

As for the burgers, you can order yours almost like a skinny and fat style, kinda combination. I personally eat a bit of a healthier lifestyle and they were easily able to accommodate me with a protein style burger, but with Ahi tuna grilled to perfection. The sauce on it brought it all together, and despite the sauce spilling out a bit, the flavor combination was on point."}
{"text":"Great and fresh food.  Cam in  on a Sunday lunch rush and I still got ithe order quickly  out.  Need more seating and someone wiping the tables down fast during peak times.  Had to clean our own tables."}
{"text":"Very good tasting food. I ordered the double char burger  and have to say it was better than in n out !"}
{"text":"Loved my veggie burger and their strawberry limeade! The place was clean and the people were friendly! This was my first time visiting a Habit Grill and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I would say the best way to describe The Habit is a place that offers tasty burgers at a good price. The burgers are't top of the line, but definitely better than traditional fast food. If your looking for a decent burger without having to shell out $$, this is your place. On the plus side, they also offer sweet potato fries and carry chicken, tuna and veggie burgers - but there aren't really any combo deals...everything is pretty much a la carte. The place is clean and the service is good with a short wait for your food because they make everything fresh = fries are always hot and crisp...yum!"}
{"text":"I tried the grilled chicken sandwich for the first time. It was an extra thin chicken breast filet that tasted okay, but the meat to bread ratio was way off.

The chicken filet is at best, 1/4\" thick. The XL sized bun overwhelmed it. I don't know why a restaurants would be so skimpy with chicken. The Habit charges a large premium for a chicken sandwich over a burger but I doubt it's any more expensive to procure than hamburger. And the wheat bun was burned. I won't order it again. Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwiches give you 3 times as much protein for a lower price !"}
{"text":"What is it with Arizona and their obsession with California chains?  It's like every mediocre thing they have in CA, it must be imported here to please the transplants and the AZ residents that have CA envy.  Unfortunately for The Habit Burger Grill, this is more like the mediocre CPK than it is the fantastic In n Out.  

The burger's are 1/4lb so to get 1 patty for $4 (without fries and a drink) is outrageous, especially when I can get a double double meal for around $5-6.  I went with the double with fries and a drink and it was over $8.  Burger was average, fries mediocre.  For people that eat in they even use the same burger diapers In n Out uses.  

I don't know what was up with the place, they literally had 10-15 employees working when I was there.  There were 6 of us dining in.  Maybe that's why it is so pricey, they have too many people to pay.  This place may appease the LA transplants that feel everything is better from back home but I don't see too many people deciding to spend $3 more for inferior food than a drive thru like In n Out.  

The only thing \"habit\" about this place is that I'm going to make a habit of not going back.  I also didn't understand why they felt the need to give out the vibrating thing as I waited for my order.  I wasn't waiting for a table, I was waiting for a bag of food.  

Hit up Lobby's a mile or so north for a big, juicy, flavorful burger  that is locally owned and blows away this less than stellar chain from CA.  The most disappointing thing is the landlord kicked out TOTTs for a run of the mill burger chain."}
{"text":"For sure our new fast(ish) food spot! 1. Eric took our order and Eric is the man! He's definitely drinking the company service standard Koolaid. He made us excited to eat here, we just kept ordering food! Everything was delicious and we already know what our next order will be."}
{"text":"Perfectly good for fast food.  Head and shoulders above the standards, and on par with the new breed of modern quick casual burger concepts.  The location is new and clean with plenty of parking, and the staff is efficient and friendly.  The menu is also fairly small and simple, which I prefer, and prices are very reasonable.

The food itself is just okay.  The burger is alright.  For something that's \"charred\" it lacked a grilled flavoring.  The bun was also a little stale.  The fries are very plain.  There was barely any texture to them, and no seasoning, not even salt.  They literally were just fried potatoes.  Could have used at least a touch of salt.  At least they weren't greasy.  I'll give Habit Burger props for the pepper bar.  That is awesome and different.

I also don't know if I dig the pager or not.  While it's nice to not hear someone saying \"order #x is ready\" every thirty seconds, I hate having something extra to hold while I wait for food.

This location is fairly close to my office, and was worth a try while driving to work.  I definitely wouldn't recommend going out of your to give it a try, but if you're in the area, why not taste something new?"}
{"text":"I'd been kinda buggin out about trying The Habit for some time. I've had mixed reviews from friends and I am picky about my meat, yo.

Well, last week my tiny had parent/teacher conference so we were leaving school late and hungry. We pull up and are both kinda looking at each other like do we really want a fast food burger? The Habit kind of meets you halfway as far as fast food is conserned. It's definitely a fast food burger but with a little gourmet flair. 

I like the way the place is set up. Kind of like a Culver's or something with those buzzy pager things that notify you when your oder is ready. 

The burger was actually good as was the bacon I ordered on top. My son ate all his food. Chicken I thinks. Also they gave him strawberry milk and a free refil before we left. 

Over all a nice experience. I am not dying to eat here again but I am also not opposed."}
{"text":"I did not experience the timing problems almost all of the negative ratings gave. My family totally LOVED EVERYTHING!! 
My hubs got a regular burger with cheese, I got the Golden Chicken sandwich, my kids got grilled cheese & chicken nuggets respectively. 
All of it was super delicious!! The chicken was tender & flavorful! It took a little longer for my chicken sandwich to come but I wasn't sitting around like where's my food! Plus when he came to give me mine he was super apologetic & gave us a free burger next visit! 
Great customer service!! Super friendly & helpful & kind staff! 
So glad we tried it! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, not crave-worthy though. The fries were cold and mushy, the burger was good but not amazing. I don't eat burgers often so when I do eat one, I hope that it knocks my socks off. My sock was only halfway off my foot. 
The wait in the drive thru was long as other reviewers have said BUT with this kind of fresh hamburger making I think you should expect that. If you want cheap, quick food go to McDonald's. I think I'll try it out again soon and try the different sides and shakes."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I've been here twice and every time it takes over 15 minutes to get through the drive-through.  Today there were only three cars in front of me. It was 20 minutes for a burger. I got home and took the burger out of the bag and of course one side of the barn was burned the other side was cold. I'm not sure how they accomplish that?"}
{"text":"We had lunch for 6 and paid about $55 for all of us.  Great prices, great burgers, yummy fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  Plenty of food for this.

3 in our party got the BBQ Bacon Burger, 2 of us got the regular burgers, and 1 got the Teriyaki Burger.  We all liked what we got.

Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  It was a nice day and the staff comes out to clean tables regularly so to make room for more customers for seating.  Friendly staff.  I believe this restaurant used to be the old Tott's that is now down the street a couple miles."}
{"text":"Chick-Fil-A was still being built... so we went here. This burger place is not bad. They had clean bathrooms, friendly workers and good burgers. I had the Santa Fe Burger - it had Guacamole...yum. As for side condiments: they had chili peppers - I stayed away from that... my friend's mouth was burning... would go again if in Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night. Arrived to find the parking lot nearly full, even on a Friday night. 

The Habit is bright and clean inside with a view into the kitchen. Let me tell you, those guys were working hard. I went with the classic single charburger with cheese and sweet potato fries. They gave me a pager and my drink cup for the short wait. It didn't take very long. 

The burger here was very good. It was hot and fresh and I thought the flavors came out. You could taste the beef, and I really like the caramelized onions they put on it, rather than red onions, which aren't my favorite. The sandwich stayed together well, which is always a plus. 

I was not as impressed with the sweet potato fries. They had a nice flavor, but they weren't crispy and I prefer crispy fries. Next time I'm going with the onion rings instead. 

For a quick place to grab a simple burger this place is a good option."}
{"text":"this place has fucked up my order 3 out of the last 3 times i have been here, but at least they also make me wait for 20 minutes to have my food served to me. i've been the only car in the drive thru and it still took 20 minutes to make a burger and a kid's nuggets, so they have just as little urgency for drive thru customers as they do for people that eat in the store. 

in conclusion, i hope the proprietors of this establishment suffer from an acute case of some sort of necrotic viral infection."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! First time here, burgers are good, food was hot, drinks are cold! Parking can be tricky if they are busy, could use some more seating, but not really a complaint."}
{"text":"Love it! Went with the family. It is a step above fast food like burger place but the burgers are juicy and the fries delicious.Will be back."}
{"text":"I have never been to this establishment before and wanted to try something new for lunch. I had never hear of this place before as well. The restaurant was clean and friendly. They had great music during my entire visit. I tried the chicken sandwich with teriyaki sauce and it was delicious! My chicken was grilled perfectly, my sweet potato fries crisp to perfection and my add ons - just the right amount. The staff was friendly and the ambiance was great for our lunch. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Location: Easy to find off the interstate, easy to get to from either side of road

Inside: Very clean, fully aware management with customer involvement, fountain drinks, clean restroom.

Food: The burgers were tasty and cooked very well. The sweet potato fries were delicious and this place is a great contender in the burger market with the likes of 5 guys, etc. It is a definite try and I think it's price is moderate for the food you receive."}
{"text":"This place fits right in between In-N-Out and 5 Guys. A little nicer than your average drive thru burger, but not a full blow expensive gourmet place either. Good, creative burgers at a very fair price. The staff is always good and you can customize if you want. I usually stick with one of their standard offerings though and you can't go wrong."}

Companion and I were in the mood for burgers for lunch and decided to try a new place. We were promptly greeted from behind the counter with a nice big smile and a cheery hello.

We both ordered the #2 Double Char ($8.15) which includes fries and a drink. Companion added cheese and bacon to his sandwich. I asked for well done fries.

They have a drink bar where you can select whatever you like to drink. This was the first place I have ever seen that has pomegranate lemonade, which was a real treat.

We found seats and loaded up on napkins as well as ketchup for the fries and some salt. Unlike many burger places they do not season their fries, which I prefer to the usual salt shower used in some places.

In due time our burgers were brought out. Big, juicy burgers that oozed when you picked it up. The fries were excellent, and crunched when I bit into them. It was nice to get my food made my way instead of being what they thought I would want.

Companion's burger was loaded with bacon and had cheese dripping off of it. Neither of us minded getting our hands a bit soiled eating such a big, excellent burger.

The place was spotlessly clean and a member of the crew even came by to make sure our lunch met our satisfaction.

The menu had quite a number of selections on it all of which were at an excellent price point. I'm already planning my next trip there to have the Tri-Tip Steak or the Portabella Char.

Dings - only one - they only cook their burgers medium or well done, and I prefer mine rare or medium rare.

4 stars"}
{"text":"Just when I was losing faith in hamburger joints,along comes The Habit. Clean professional atmosphere, friendly staff and fantastic food. I ordered The Santa Barbara and a order of onion rings. My order was plated picture perfect and wasn't a thrown together mess as I tend to see at other places.  Double patties with cheese,  grilled onions pickles, chopped fresh lettuce, and avocado on grilled sourdough bread. Throw in some crispy rings and a cold strawberry limeade and yes my faith is restored. I left satisfied and full and didn't spend much at all as thier prices are affordable. Do your self a huge favor and eat here, trust me you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This location is usually pretty busy so you have to be prepared for a little wait. The food is excellent though and I have enjoyed the portabella mushroom burger the best and their tempura green beans are SO YUMMY! The staff has always been kind and helpful. I have taken to going through the drive-thru and going to a nearby park to eat with my family rather than trying to find seating for all of us. The drive-thru service has been quick and I have never had an issue with my order being messed up."}
{"text":"Habit Burger pleasantly surprised me.  Although the menu is your typical fast food fare, the product is far from it.  The place is sparklingly clean, and remarkably missing that permeating deep-fried smell that infiltrates most burger chain joints.  The double char with American cheese and caramelized onions was freaking awesome, and super satisfying.  As were the crispy, medium-cut fries sans all the nasty oil.  The best part about this meal was the marked LACK of grease; I really didn't feel all that guilty after scarfing my American grub.  In fact, I finished it off with a chocolate malt made with real ice cream... delicious.  They also have 3 kinds of freshly brewed unsweetened tea, which for you fellow ice tea drinkers you'll relate to the fountain-drink alternative perk.  And finally, the service was great.  Efficient and friendly, but not overly annoying.  Great neighborhood joint!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place for lunch today.  We ordered the Santa Barbara burger, which did not disappoint; Char burger, sweet potato fries, onion rings and a garden salad.  We also had two beverages.  The food was delicious!  The char burger was juicy (but not too much) and wrapped so it made it nice to eat without everything spilling out.  The Santa Barbara wasn't wrapped but the way it's put together allowed it to be eaten without a big mess.  The salad's ingredients were very fresh and didn't give the appearance of having been made and sitting around.  It was also a nice mix of lettuce, not just iceberg, had tomato slices, cucumber slices, shredded carrots and croutons; it was huge.  The onion rings were nice and crisp--the batter they used had a good flavor and the sweet potato fries were very good too.

We will definitely be back because there are some other good menu items that we would like to try.  They have a nice variety of salad offerings also.  In addition, they have some not-so-run-of-the-mill offerings such as Charbroiled Albacore Tuna sandwich, Tri-tip sandwich, and tempura green beans to name a few.  You can request your sandwich be served with no bun, but lettuce \"bun\" instead...I think that's called protein style.

They have a nice condiment bar that offers jalapeños, pepperocinis, hot peppers and lemons & limes.  Also, they have a large pump with little cups for ketchup.  This is located near the beverage area and the napkins, etc. are there too.  I liked the layout because you could get your beverage, then assemble the lid, etc. and wipe the counter if you spilled and the napkins and trash are right there so it makes it easy to clean up (your mother doesn't work there...so it's always courteous to clean up...LOL!)

In addition to soda, they have a nice offering of several different teas and their strawberry limeade, which I hear they are known for but I didn't try it.  They also offer milkshakes and malts which looked good but I didn't try those either. They also offered a vitamin water from the machine.

We also liked the decor, which was a step up from the usual fast-food establishments.  The booths had nice, cushiony seats and were not so smashed in together; the 2 person booth & table top was bigger than most places so it didn't feel so cramped. They also have a nice, 10-seat hi-top \"community\" table that is convenient and allows for flexibility in seating.  Plus the decor is a bit more upscale than other places.  For example, they had nice pendant lights over that community table.  They also had a few seats outside (in the shade).  I guess I would describe it as quick food casual and not \"fast food\".

Super friendly staff also contributed to our great experience here.  They also have a drive thru if that is appealing to you.  It's sort of funky because you have to go around the bank just to the east of the Habit to access the drive thru.

Last, but certainly not least, it was very clean!  Of course it's new and we'll see if they can keep that up.  

For fast, casual, fresh & delicious food in a clean place, this like will become our go-to place! Try it out!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town. The char burger which is their classic is delicious, juicy and always cooked perfectly. It comes with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, caramelized onions and cheese. They also offer this burger in double patty. It's my favorite. The onion rings are a must. The fries or just ok. Aside from fountain drinks they offer strawberry limeade and a peach ginger drink. Both really good. My favorite is the peach ginger. Customer service is always on point and service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"We came here after a nice long hike near by and decided what a better way of putting back all of those calories we just burnt by eating here.lol. Well at least we decided to share!

I was actually pleasantly surprised at The Habit. I was expecting another trendy burger shop that was all about the scene not the food but I couldn't have been more wrong here at The Habit. We ordered a double Santa Barbara style burger to split and it was really good. The Santa Barbara style had avocado and a sourdough bun..it was a perfect size to share with an order of fries and a drink. Total came to right around $10 bucks. Can't beat the taste and value for that price, and we left full and satisfied. At I can say that we went to a burger joint and split a meal after the hike! I would come here again!"}
{"text":"After so many friends saying this is a great burger joint, had to go.  We went at 11:00 and it was already packed.  I see why.
I got the pineapple terriyaki burger and she got the char.  Both yummy and seemed very fresh.  We also got the onion rings and fries and didn't leave anything behind.  
Burgers & fries may seem a trivial meal and hard to screw up but this place makes fast food a thing of the past.
The staff was super friendly to our first experience and we will definitely go back avoiding McD, Jack & Wendy.   
I rank Habit right up there with In-N-Out and a bit more comfy casual."}
{"text":"Love The Habit! Always hits the spot- love this location,love the staff, love the ranch, love the food & love that we can preorder; they save card info and all I have to do is pick up!"}

Always nice to enjoy this on a gorgeous Friday night. 
Buon Apetite!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are off the hook! And finally someone other than TGIF that has tempura green bean fries!"}
{"text":"Staff seems very friendly and of course the food is great. Kinda small dining area compared to others I've been to before but very nice!"}
{"text":"Darn good chargrilled burger for the money.  Very flavorful, and the garnish was fresh tasting as well.  Plus they finally put a business at this location that may finally not go out of business.  They completely remodeled this location on the inside so it is all new and nice inside.  Clean bathrooms, great (self) service, and good food gets 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"For a fast food hamburger joint this place was very good!! Very tasty burgers and their sweet potatoe fries were good as well! Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Should of known better. What do I expect from a quick burger joint. Santa Barbra burger, was supposed to be charred \"not\" just no taste. The French fries were cold they did give us new warm ones. Husbands double char looked good but he said it was lacking taste. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Fresh, hot quality burgers and sandwiches. Crispy fries. Reasonable prices. Grabbed a late dinner. We were not disappointed. We will become regulars at this location. I am told the shakes are outstanding."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Habit Burger Grill 4 stars on the strength of the burger, and when my wife saw that she gasped in disbelief, and insisted Habit is only 3 stars. 

She wins.

She did not like the grilled chicken salad she ordered. Way too much flavorless iceberg lettuce, she said, and the grilled chicken while ok, was nothing special. The dressing was typical processed salad dressing.

But I came for the burgers.

Overall my double charburger was good. I liked the onions, and the shredded lettuce and other toppings. The burgers are cooked on a grill, and I thought the patties were a little dry, and not as tender as I would've liked. I really prefer patties cooked on a flat top, they tend to be juicier cooked that way. And there wasn't much char on my burgers, or at least I couldn't taste any.

The fries were a letdown. They're ok, but just ok. 

Habit burger was tops in a Consumers Reports reader's survey of Burger chains. But I disagree. It's a step up for sure from Wendy's or McDonalds, but there are better burgers chains out there for sure."}
{"text":"My first time coming here after months of wanting to try it. Let me say it was very delicious. I enjoyed my tri tip sandwich on Sourdough bread with fries. Its a little pricey but once in a while I don't mine going there since their quality is good. I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"My first time here and I have to say I love the burger I had. The place is nice and the staff is nice. The only gripe I have, the lack of floor cleanup, table & chairs wipe downs. I'll give it 5 stars next time if they handle that part. I know it's a lot to expect in the day and age of the millennials and snow flakes since their attention to detail is usually lacking not too mention their inability to want to work hard. That being said I want to reiterate I like this place and the burgers are awesome!"}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich was the flats peace meat I have ever had and that was my first and probably last time going to this one"}
{"text":"Great burgers and salads.   The Cobb is my favorite.   Friendly staff and good prices."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a Sunday afternoon.  I have been curious to try Habit, having made a tour of the other newish burger joints - Smashburger, Culvers, 5 Guys, etc.  The restaurant itself is stylish and clean, so I liked that.  You order at the counter and get your food when it's ready.

The burger was ok, nothing special at all.  The fries were good, and the side salad came with a really delicious balsamic vinaigrette, a dressing I've tired of but decided to try here and really liked it.  

The manager stopped by our table which was nice.

The menu has other interesting options that we didn't try (tuna steak sandwich, chicken, veggie burger, etc). 

My 3 star rating is due to the salad, the cleanliness of the restaurant and the attentiveness of the manager.  Otherwise I would have given a 2 star rating due to the very high prices for what you get. 

Sorry Habit, for a burger I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Normally their burgers are awesome. I have had their chicken sandwich, tuna, and regular burger and have never been disappointed, until now. I ordered a burger and onion rings to go via Internet. When I got there my order didn't appear to be ready. After a short5 minute wait my order came up. Cool, back to work I go. When I got back to work and sat down to eat, it looked like my burger had been stepped on. Smashed up with a dry bun. As stated before , their burgers never disappoint. This one had a flavor like it had been sitting for a while. Onion rings were hot because they cook them when you arrive. Everything else was spot on including the service.

I think next time I'll just walk in and order to go so my food will be fresh as possible. The stale burger most likely a product of bad timing. I recommend eating there, just be careful ordering online."}
{"text":"The Habit has been one of my favorite stops for lunch. They have a great grilled chicken sandwich and I use to love their salads. I've noticed though the quality of their salads have gone down. When I order a chicken caesar salad, it should be with chopped romaine. This was my salad today. More than 50% is chunky watery lettuce. There are only very free pieces of green leafy lettuce. I wish they would fix this ratio."}
{"text":"Love the food and the friendly service, but we visited this location over the weekend and it was so dirty I had some reservations about eating there.  Lots of trash on the tables and a 'Wet Floor' sign they clearly put down after a soda spill (but without mopping it up, as the floors were super sticky and crunchy...ew!)  Saw a few employees standing around and chatting as it wasn't peak hours. 

I will visit the other Tempe location in the future when I need my strawberry malt and crunchy fry fix!"}
{"text":"I went to this Habit Burger and it was amazing Carly was the manager she was doing a great job running it my cashier was Jacob he had a wonderful smile and knew all the items that I was ordering offered extras
Arlene was amazing..and all the cooks were awesome the food was amazing
I love this place!!"}
{"text":"I actually REALLY love this place. It's hard to find a decent burger out here! The menu is small, but to me that's usually a good sign that they 'perfect' their craft. I love the toasted bun on the burgers. I ordered the Mushroom and Swiss char burger and it was super juicy and made-to-order. The french fries were delicious and not soggy or salty, but I would pass on the sweet potato fries next time. Didn't have much flavor and tasted like cardboard to me. My boyfriend ordered the strawberry malt shake and I ordered the chocolate malt shake and downed that thing like there's no tomorrow. I

Overall, it was a very unhealthy but delicious dinner! Reminds me of a burger joint in L.A. that I hit up every time I'm out there. Glad to find a place similar right down the street!"}
{"text":"Got the Teriyaki burger with everything.  It was very good and fresh.  For me personally, I think it is comparable to 5 guys or Shake Shack.  I will definitely eat here again. I think the best thing about this place is the customer service.  Extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed the first time I tried The Habit about a year ago and hadn't been back since. My husband suggested we try it again so we went. I ordered a single burger and he ordered a double and we got fries and onion rings.There was still more mayo than should probably be added to a burger (and I like mayo), but otherwise I enjoyed the meat to bun ratio and other condiments used. Both the onion rings and fries were good and the prices were very reasonable. I am glad I gave The Habit another try and will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely a better option than In N Out and for that reason I give them a 4/5. If you can't put bacon on your burger, what's the point?? You even have a choice between regular fries and sweet potato fries. Do t forget to skip the bun and go for the lettuce wrap!

Service was friendly and I didn't have to wait very long!"}
{"text":"This burger joint far exceeded my expectations both in service and in food quality, not too mention a pleasant and modest bill. 

We entered and was greeted warmly by the cashier, who soon noticed that this was our first time. After explaining the menu, the teriyaki burger with tempura green beans was the meal chosen. All ingredients of the burger had their own notes to play, but the meat was unquestionably lead character. There are banana, jalapeño, and chili peppers that pair well for an added kick. 

The tempura green beans were an exciting alternative to fries or onion rings although they are on the bucket list for next visit. The light crunch and freshness of the green beans had a wonderful lightness to them. 

The peach and ginger nectar was excellent and refreshing. I do recommend it, but they're are plenty of options for beverages.

For service, I will say this: I needed this sandwich to be split in half. I approached the counter to ask for a knife. The associate that asked if I needed help was so amiable, and it looked like she had just arrived to work, happily, and with a smile, gave me a knife using a napkin to keep it clean. Way to go!"}
{"text":"The Habit Burger is a welcome addition to the Henderson dining offerings!
Another Southern California transplant with three locations in the Las Vegas Valley.
I regularly order the Original Charburger with cheese - comes with lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, and mayo.
One of my favorite burgers right now.
Has a varied menu that includes burgers, grilled and crispy chicken sandwiches as well as a grilled steak and albacore tuna sandwiches as well as a veggie burger and salads.
Food is consistently good - with one exception.
Their French fries are not  the quality they should be to stand up to the rest of the food.
I generally order my burger or sandwich and skip the fries.

{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised with my first visit to The Habit. I had seen the chain before in AZ and decided to finally step out of my box and give it a try. I'm so glad I did!

It has fast food pricing with a dine in type service feel. You start by ordering at the counter and they give you a buzzer that goes off once your food is ready. Somewhat similar to In N Out but with \"fancier\" selections. My boyfriend and I each had a burger along with sides and our total came out to under $20. Smoking deal if you ask me.

For my meal I chose the Teriyaki burger along with green bean fries. The burger was very good, but slightly messy. Tbh my favorite part was the green bean fries and homemade ranch. I'm an absolute ranch addict so I can usually tell if a place is going to rock based solely on their ranch.

I'll definitely be back for more, just wish their was a location on the southwest side. I suppose a girl can always dream."}
{"text":"A friend and I recently met up here for a quick bite to eat for dinner. This location is located in front of a strip mall next to cafe rio. It wasn't too busy when we got there so there was no wait to order or for a table.

We decided to share the Chicken Club Sandwich and Ahi Tuna Sandwich along with a side of Tempura Green Beans. We both loved the tuna sandwich. It had a very unique and tasty flavor. The chicken sandwich was just ok. The chicken itself was a little dry and needed extra sauce. The green beans were pretty good, nice and crispy. 

I'd definitely come back here again for the tuna sandwich and to try one of their burgers. Super quick, friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"Lot's of burger places and this is another one."}
{"text":"Tried this place because I had a free burger coupon from the local paper. Good burger but not much to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times and give it a solid 4-stars. The staff is always helpful and accommodating. The food is very tasty and the fries (regular and sweet potato) are delicious.

We have two young boys and they love coming here. They love the burgers!

The manager and staff do a great job and take pride in this establishment.

If you are in need of a tasty, quick bite to eat (lunch or dinner), hit up The Habit!"}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers but I figured a lot of people ate here so I'd try it out. I'm really not a fan of ground beef but the burgers had great flavor. The bread and veggies tasted fresh and I was glad there was no old lettuce in my food. I ordered regular fries and learned they have green bean fries. My friend allowed me to try one of hers and I will definitely be back to try them out. There was no line and the restaurant was clean! Very impressive for such a high traffic place. Everything was clean and there was no over flowing ice in the soda dispenser which means they check for cleanliness regularly."}
{"text":"Mushroom Char, was juicy bun was toasty, cheese melty, mushrooms seasoned really good, they offer simple menu, only a handful of items on menu, but everything looked good and tasted good, fresh cut yummy French fries, I really like this place and atmosphere, it was really great and I really enjoyed it"}
{"text":",  probably the best burger in Vegas but it's a bit expensive for what you get but also very courteous staff and they will tell you what the best is on the menu if you're a newcomer which is the route I usually take so they are very helpful"}
{"text":"Just ate here with my wife. The Santa Barbara double with sour dough bread is the best. Great prices and top notch quality."}
{"text":"Homies on the grill know how to whip up a solid ass burger! Prompt and good service. Deffff going back to hammer down on a double burger again."}
{"text":"We usually eat here quite a bit because I like the fried green beans. But this time there was hair on our fries. So we won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"I hesitated to come here with all the bad reviews including my sister's. But I'm a foodie and trying new places it's what I do. So based on reviews drive thru seems like a horrific idea so I opted to dine in. Let me tell you I was very lucky there was only one table left. I ordered the #1 with onion rings, my son had the same but with the fries. I like the variety of drinks, 3 different types of teas, 2 different types of lemonade and of course the coke products. The establishment itself is clean and well kept, staff very friendly, even had someone come up to our table all if we needed anything. Our order took about 5-10mins. Everything was hot, onion rings were crispy, fries crispy. Burgers are ok... Prices are decent. The menu has a variety of different sandwiches , salads and sides. All in all I would come back."}
{"text":"After many more visits to The Habit, I have definitely become a fan of their burgers. I used to think they were a bit greasy but I have found that if you get them without the grilled onions this is not the case. And I did a comparison of the calories and fat contents of other nearby fast food burger places and they are pretty good in that department. Their burgers are a great portion size but if you do have a bigger appetite you can always order a double. They don't offer gluten free buns but I recently tried the lettuce wrapped option and it was actually really good. They used huge leaves of very fresh and crisp iceberg lettuce. Someone really took the time to wrap it carefully because it didn't fall apart or get messy either. So that was pretty cool. The only thing keeping them from 5 stars at this point is that I wish they would offer real cheddar cheese instead of processed \"American\" cheese."}
{"text":"I like the habit. They have burgers and fries and some salads.so you have options! The take a kids grilled cheese, and a burger with a lot of avocado and fried green beans. I like the fact that they take your order and then cook your food. I also like that my daughter got a Gummi burger with the meal. The green beans were something different. They were pretty tasty though . The habit is pretty good but not my favorite burger."}
{"text":"Grilled tuna on seeded bun- Excellent flavors with the teriyaki sauce and veggies. Although I would ask for it to be cooked medium next time. Tempura greenbeans- They come with a very flavorful ranch for dipping and I highly recommend them- crunchy outside and fresh inside... perfect! The freshest food that you can expect from ANY burger joint!"}
{"text":"Gave this place two chances.  The first in Santa Barbara and was just ok. The 2 nd time here and there was absolutely NO taste to the meat.  I'm over it and back to other establishments."}
{"text":"The best chain burger place. This takes the throne from Five Guys. Excellent prices, great service, the restaurant is clean and organized and most of all, the burgers are fresh and taste delicious. What more do you want in a fast food restaurant. The only downfall? Their onion rings, but its a preference of taste. I just dont care for the batter they use for the rings."}
{"text":"Went because we had gotten coupons. We tried the cobb salad and mushroom cheeseburger. Both were really bad. The \"salad\" was more of a cole slaw and the burgers at McDonald's are much better."}
{"text":"This is just more than just a run of the mill fast food burger place! While the Habit has other tasty offerings, you won't be disappointed in going with the burger mainstay. If you are looking for something other than the bland, uninspiring, and \"never like the photo\" burgers at the big chains, duck in here..."}
{"text":"Not my first time a The Habit, but glad to see one open fairly close. Lots of burger choices in this neck of the woods, but chances are I'll make the  Habit my choice for a good burger fix.

These are not huge patties, but they are tasty and perfectly grilled.  The edges are slightly crunchy, yet this is not an over done burger. Be advised, if you order a single char, you don't really get enough meat to savor how tasty this burger is...my opinion at least. Noticed on the menu that they will wrap your burger in lettuce if you are looking to ditch the bun.

Still have yet to try anything other than burgers, fries, and onion rings. I like the onion rings more than I like the fries. Big tri-tip fan, so that is going to have to be a choice one of these days. Now that I have a close location, that should become easier! 

If your significant other is a burger hater or just doesn't feel like having one, there are some tasty looking alternatives. What other burger places also have chicken, tri-tip, and albacore tuna? If all else fails, order a salad...

The Habit always seems to stress good friendly service and that was on display here. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Decent burgers, a step up from the typical fast food burger chains.  In addition to your regular beef patty, there are other options such as tuna, veggie patty, and chicken.  You have several choices of bread, and it's made your way with as many or as little toppings as you want.  Prices are decent too.  

I had the tuna burger, which was OK.  It was a thinner cut of tuna than I'm used to, and cooked well-done.  The tuna itself probably had to be cooked well regardless, since it had a hint of fishy taste, indicating it wasn't the freshest fish.  I had a bite of the mushroom swiss burger, which was alright.  It came with a good amount of mushrooms and cheese, with plentiful toppings.  

There is a free-range soda fountain here as well, which is nice for unlimited soda refills.  If I'm in the mood for a burger and don't feel like paying a lot for it, this is a good balance between price and quality."}
{"text":"Delicious onion rings! Great burgers and easy take out options. Definitely better than most burger places:)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good and very clean. The grilled onions on the burgers were a nice touch  My family loved the tempura green beans. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is in the running for my favorite burger joint. With Smashburger coming in second. The Santa Barbara burger with avocado and sourdough..OMG! I think I died and went to heaven! Side note: Post mates delivers!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through. Ordered the santa Barbra burger, my daughter got the kids chicken nuggets. Disappointed. Quality does not match the prices. Pulled out of the drive through and went to snack on some fries and they were room temperature and soggy . The santa Barbra burger was just ok. The patty itself was tasteless and almost looked microwaved. A little let down. I'm better off sticking with in and out"}
{"text":"Due to misinformation I didn't give it a good review. They have gone out of their way to let us know that they do have alternates so we will be going their. I thank you for all the info. See you soon."}
{"text":"I tried the sabra monica burger. I been here couple times now and wanted to try something new. They messed my order up and the fries were so simple and out of the frozen bag. They need to give more flavor to those fries. The burger was great. When I went to tell them about the messed up order they didn't even apologize ? What kind of customer service is that. They re made it. But didn't tell me a word? Ok they need to work on they hospitality ."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their lettuce wrap cheeseburger and the service is always amazing."}
{"text":"Very good burger! Nice thick patty that did not taste of freezer burn. Crisp lettuce slaw and a thick cut tomato. Cooked just right and great sides. Especially love the tempura green beans. Not a fan of the onion rings but the sweet potato fries are pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger person but i had to try it.  My kids wanted to eat here.  The burger was good and tasty but it was too small for the bun.  Hubby had the teriyaki burger he enjoyed it, I had bbq bacon and the boys had the double char bacon added. 
$60 for 6 ppl, all combos.

So far customer service is good.  Carolina was very patient and kind.  We had no idea what we wanted and we took a little while to decide. She read everything back to us twice so that the order was right.  

Everything was clean including the bathroom.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I always love coming to the Habit! I've tried about half the food on the menu and everything is great and the iced tea is good! The tables are always clean and the employees go out of their way to make your experience more enjoyable. I love the habit!"}
{"text":"This is one of, if not the best burger in Las Vegas. I go to a location in Southern California all the time.

The service here is great. Happy, polite and friendly people that seem happy to be working there and happy to help.

The burgers are OUTSTANDING!!! No freezer burn. Freshly cooked and wonderful flavors.

The fries are perfect. Cooked to a crunch outside and soft hot inside.

The only down side is they employ people with facial piercings. This totally grosses me out. 

I am a regular and will continue to be.

PS. I have been to the Howard Hughes location. This location has much happier people!"}
{"text":"My husband was craving a burger...and not just any burger, ya know a GOOD burger.  I worked my top navigator skill set to locate The Habit.  
The location is convenient and easily accessed.  Plenty of parking and thoughtful consideration for those handicapped and to-goers!
Must say the pricing is on the better burger side of fast food.  While my husband sat down after paying the bill mentioned it better be a d@mn good burger, I did not hear him complain about any of the food!! 
The milkshake was delicious and paired well with my onion rings and teriyaki burger....
I must say the only reason I did give it a 4, is due to the higher prices and the non-military appreciation(no discount for our military family?! Come on man, we MUST thank them!)"}
{"text":"I dream of this burger I had in Vegas every single day and my life will never be the same after! Best burger I have ever ordered in my life.... Seriously! We also got the fried green beans and onion rings on the side which were also amazing! They need this in New England!"}
{"text":"Quality burger with great prices. Looking for a burger that's not going make you feel like you ate the whole cow this is perfect for those diet cheat days."}
{"text":"\"There's no substitute for quality,\" is the Habit Burger Grill mantra. The Habit Burger Grill puts substance into their mantra. From a mom and pop burger place established 1969 in San Bernardino, the Habit Burger Grill has grown into a 147 restaurant chain. They are now based in Irvine, California sharing a corporate headquarters city with another burger icon known as In N Out. The chain is in a major expansion mode. In August 2015, the Habit entered Las Vegas with this location. This will be the first of fifteen locations in the Las Vegas market with a second one to open at Blue Diamond and Decatur. 

   Fans of The Habit Burger Grill also call it the Habit. For the rest of the Review it is referred to as the Habit. The Habit righteously has many fans. In 2014, \"Consumer Reports\" awarded the Habit Charburger as the Best Burger in America. 

   I had heard praise about the Habit. My brother told me good things about it. Subsequently my Yelp friends would recommend it through reviews and pictures. Today, it was time to check out the Habit. 

  This Habit is in a crowded part of town made more crowded by construction on Flamingo Road. Getting onto eastbound Flamingo Road could be a challenge. My tip is to exit behind the building. Turn left and a second left onto Howard Hughes Pkwy that leads to a traffic signal at Flamingo. Ultimately the Habit itself is crowded. The restaurant was nearly full at 11:30 AM on a Wednesday. 

  Right off the bat I was impressed with the pricing. The charbroiled Charburger combo which includes a beverage and paper boat of fries starts off at $7. With cheese at 60 cents extra it came out to $8.22. The woman who took my order took my money with a smile. I would eat the Charburger with a smile. That would be in a few minutes. She gave me a buzzer with an appropriate saying \"Better to wait a short time for your burger than have your burger wait a long time for you.\" If I waited by the open kitchen the cooks would make the burger before my eyes. 

   The Charburger included cheese, mayo, pickle, tomato, lettuce, and caramelized onions between toasted buns. If I wanted more spice to it; there was a pepper bar featuring jalapeños, pepperoncini, pickled banana peppers, and hot sauces. The burger didn't need more spice. Just a handful of napkins. The fries were also good and plentiful. Their strawberry limeade was the bomb. The bottomless beverage included the delicious beverage that could win the Consumer Reports \"Best Limeade in America.\" 

    Personally, another advantage of this Habit is being near my coffee habit. It is a short walk to Starbuck's which made a nice sequel to the burger adventure. 

    I give a thumbs up to the Habit. I look forward to the opening of the Blue Diamond at Decatur location."}
{"text":"Today is National Cheeseburger Day. I would celebrate it after a hike up in Mount Charleston. From Mount Charleston to Henderson there was an overwhelming number of choices to celebrate National Cheeseburger Day. It is a compliment to Habit Burger that out of anyplace in the Las Vegas valley to celebrate National Cheeseburger Day that I chose them. 

   A few months ago, I reviewed the First Habit Burger to open up in Las Vegas at Flamingo Road and Howard Hugh's Parkway. The four star rating left me with a positive impression of this hamburger chain that started in Santa Barbara back in 1969. Since my Review, Habit Burger has opened two additional locations in the Las Vegas valley. This very location is the third one. 

   The Henderson Habit Burger sits in a pod at the Sprout's-Barnes & Noble Power Center. It fills a void in a shopping center that was in need of a fast food restaurant. Habit Grill is a short walk to retailers that include Barnes & Noble, Petsmart, Office Max, and etcetera. 

   The size of the restaurant is larger than the one on Flamingo. In addition to the large lobby there is outdoor seating. 

  To celebrate National Cheeseburger Day, I ordered the Charburger with cheese meal. Without cheese the Charburger meal, which includes a fountain beverage and French Fries is $7 plus tax. Because I added cheese, it came out to $8.22. Not bad when a similar burger at Five Guys or Smashburger is around $5 more. And not bad when the quality is far better than McDonald's for nearly the exact price. The Charburger is not one of those burgers that sits under a light. Upon my order it was made fresh. The woman who took my order called out \"charburger\" to the employees in the open kitchen. After handing her $8.22, she presented me with a receipt and buzzer that went off when the meal was ready. From the counter, I walked a few feet past the little station with jalapeños to the Coke machine. Regardless that the strawberry lemonade looked good, I filled my beverage cup at the Coke fountain. A feet away, I settled at an oversize booth. 

     Upon the buzzer going off, I picked up my food. On my tray was a nice size cheeseburger next to a boat plate of French fries. The decent size of French Fries were flavorful. That leads to a point that I will bring up. Habit Burger differentiates themselves from a sundry of the competition by offering one size meal instead of medium and large. The Charburger with cheese was celebrating National Cheeseburger Day in style. The thick cheeseburger topped with caramelized onions, mayonnaise, tomato, and lettuce (passed over pickles) was just as tasty as some cheeseburgers that I have ordered in full service restaurants. This was a one napkin meal owing to the fact that it was not falling apart, loaded with filler sauces that cause the hands to become sticky, or grease. I enjoyed every bite of the Charburger with cheese. 

    I am under the impression that there will be new Habit Burgers in Las Vegas. It is one of the growing hamburger chains that is revolutionalizing the fast food landscape by selling made to order delicious burgers and sandwiches at reasonable prices. It is reasonable to anticipate that I might be celebrating National Cheeseburger Day 2017 in a new Habit Burger. In conclusion it is most reasonable to anticipate that I will be returning to Habit Burger."}
{"text":"Since the time that I visited the first Habit Burger in Las Vegas at Hughes Center Drive in April 2016, the Habit Burger is a fast casual brand that I trust. Evidently it is a trust shared by several people. Habit Burger is growing at a rapid pace. Since I reviewed the Hughes Center Drive location on April 4, 2016; Habit Burger opened 103 locations. Talk about rapid growth! Habit Burger's \"Charburger\" had also been voted the Best Burger in America by Consumer Reports in the middle of 2014.

  The way I see it, the Habit Burger joins the movement of Class-A fast casual chains that have settled in Las Vegas alongside In N Out, Shake Shack, and Freddie's. In similar fashion to the Class-A fast casual chains, the restaurants include an open kitchen, made to order food, and better quality.

  It was after hours of hiking in Spring Mountain Ranch State Park that I decided to have a post-hiking supper in a fast casual restaurant that I trust. Now if only parking here was as smooth as the restaurant experience. This Habit Burger is in the Albertson's-anchored Shopping center at the northeast corner of Blue Diamond and Decatur. The back of the restaurant faces Blue Diamond Road. The issue is that there is a high traffic volume on both Decatur and Blue Diamond that creates a risky situation pulling onto southbound Decatur without a traffic signal or having to cross three lanes of traffic on Blue Diamond westbound to make a u-turn onto the eastbound highway. Furthermore, if you are not using the drive thru chances are that there will be a decent walk to the restaurant. 

  When I visited the restaurant on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 6:15 pm, the friendly lady at the counter greeted me right away. Above her it was a breeze ordering off the menu. On account of the fact that there are only a couple of combination menu items, I was immediately set on the Charcheeseburger combo. It included French Fries and beverage. After taxes, it came out to $8.65. With the food being prepared upon ordering, the friendly lady presented me with a buzzer that went off when the food was ready.

  On a Tuesday evening, there were plenty of tables. I sat in the back right at a table overlooking the open kitchen. After hearing horror stories about fast food restaurants including a Long Island Checkers, I would like to see who is making the food that I am going to eat. And I want to see what is going on. It was near the open kitchen where I filled up my beverage cup from the Coke fountain. If I had been up for Peach & Ginger Nectar or Strawberry Limeade I could of filled the cup with one of these signature Habit Burger beverages. It was at the edge of the open kitchen where I partook in my Habit Grill tradition of enjoying a couple of chili peppers from the pickle condiment station which also includes peppercinis and jalapeños.

   The Charcheeseburger combo came out Yelp photo ready. The sandwich is in a sleeve that adds a nice photo quality to it. Even better than photographing it was eating it. Between two fresh tasting buns was the charbroiled burger, crisp lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, pickles, and mayonnaise. Where the sandwich wasn't huge in size it made up for it in taste. I know that I just enjoyed a delicious burger when I experience a charburger aftertaste. Complimenting the Charcheeseburger were good tasting French Fries.

 Habit Burger has yet to let me down. As of the time of this review that comes over two years from my initial Habit Burger review, this is a fast casual brand name that I still trust."}
{"text":"Really good fast food burgers. This was my first time trying them out, loved how fresh everything tasted.  The prices were very good for the quality of the food.   I had a double char burger which I thought was pretty darn good.   Loved their onion rings and fries, next time I need to get a shake!
I left very satisfied for the entire rest of the day."}
{"text":"Tasty burger, but not enough to unseat In-N-Out or Smashburger. I try to get the signature item when going to a new burger place, so I had the Original Double Char with cheese, fries, and a drink. The patties are flame grilled and the flavor profile reminded me of a fancier Whopper. It was cooked well, but nothing about the burger was distinct enough to separate it from other fast food burgers. The fries reminded me of fries you get at a baseball game. Standard fountain drink offerings, but of note were the additional handmade strawberry limeade and three fresh brewed teas. The strawberry limeade was delicious and refreshing.

If I want a burger, I'll probably not come here again, especially since In-N-Out is cheaper. However, there are other items that caught my eye. You don't normally find things like a tri-tip steak sandwich and an albacore tuna sandwich on the menu at a fast food burger joint, so I will definitely try those items on the next visit."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but I haven't eaten anything there that I didn't like. Milkshakes were cloyingly sweet and I couldn't finish mine. Burgers, fish, and steak sandwiches were delicious. Fries are average. Nice, well-executed decor."}
{"text":"Hmmm nice clean place it's basically an upscale burger joint. You walk in you order at the front like you would at McDonald's or Burger King and then you sit down.I wasn't impressed with the food. Had to try this place out since it was close to our house."}
{"text":"If you eat anywhere in Gilbert, please go here. My coworker recommended this place to me. She even brought a menu to work because she was so impressed. From customer service to the burgers, it is the best! Especially Mr Connelly. He has wonderful work ethics. Thank you for a great dinner"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH TEMPURA GREEN BEANS!! 

Went here on my lunch break and was not disappointed. The burger was freshly made and BIG and delicious. The ingredients were fresh and overall my experience was excellent. OH! And they use actual bacon, not the tissue paper thin stuff you find at other burger places. Actual, delicious, cooked to perfection crisp bacon. 
 And the tempura green beans were crunchy and salty and wonderful, you've gotta try them at least once. If not several times. 
  I'll definitely go back and drag some of my office mates with me."}
{"text":"Great choices, great burgers....always crazy anywhere lunch time though. Consistantly great food & customer service.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is better than your normal chain burger joint. Employees are always cheerful"}
{"text":"went here for the first time and i decided to mix things up and try a veggie burger also for my first time ever and it was absolutely delicious. exceeded my expectations. i got it without tomatoes and onions but i had the cucumber and avocado on it and it was amazing. you can really tell that the food is fresh. the fries were really good too. the staff was nice as well. i'll be going back for sure"}
{"text":"Love it I received a coupon for a free burger It was marvelous darling just marvelous!!! With the carmelized onions and the sweet potato fries  ummm good"}
{"text":"For a fast food burger place, this place rocks! I've always been an In-N-Out kinda girl (Shhh, don't tell them that) but I decided to give this place a try since I kept passing by and wanted to see what the hype was all about. The burgers are delicious, the fries are always nice and crispy, and their malts are the bomb! If you've never been in the staff is super helpful and offers suggestions for you too. I've tried the tri-tip burger with sweet potato fries as well- YUM! I can definitely see why this place is called The Habit."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch after a shopping trip with my mom.  You walk in and are immediately in line staring at a menu on the wall above the cashiers heads. You stand in line and order, pay, fill your drinks at the fountain and then sit down and wait to be buzzed.  The menu consists of single and double burgers with the option to add bacon, cheese, avocado etc.  I believe I saw a chicken sandwich and few salads on the menu as well.  But I was here for a burger. I went with a mushroom swiss burger and it was rather tasty. They call their burgers \"char burgers\" and there was that distinct grill flavor to my burger.  Mom got a double cheese char burger and was pleased.  We split a side of fries.  They were good but I wish we would've gotten the onion rings.  The table next to us had some and they looked delicious. I also noticed a pepper bar where you can add your own jalepenos or pepperoncinis, etc. next to where you grab your ketchup and napkins. In conclusion, it was a decent meal.  Would I drive out of my way to come back? Probably not.  But if  I happen to be near one when the next burger craving strikes, Habit Burger will satisfy my hunger,"}
{"text":"It is good and I will go again. Price is reasonable and not out of line. Fries are good. Burger was a little small but still adequate size. Service was good even though it was a counter order. OK, this is not the most glowing review ever but the place doesn't knock your socks off. But I can't say anything bad about it. When looking at most hamburger places that you go to that are solid you can add this place. I'll go again, but I won't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I came for lunch right as the restaurant opened. We were greeted by Cassie who was smiling and friendly.  It was our first time here so we asked her for some recommendations and she recommended the Double Char. I got the Teriyaki Char and my BF got the Double Char. We shared fries, onion rings and sweet potato fries which were all very tasty.  I must say we received the best customer service I've ever gotten at a fast food restaurant.  Cassie came by to see how we were enjoying our food since it was our first time here and when we were done eating another woman came by and took our tray away. We would definitely recommend coming here to eat and the price point was decent as well!"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm from Hawai'i and anybody else who is island grown knows that the #1 burger place to eat at in the mainland is In-N-Out. But if my local braddahs, sistas, aunties, and uncles are reading this, then go check this place out and tell me if In-N-Out still has the best burgers!! I am a pretty picky eater and also, a person who DOESN'T EVEN LIKE BURGERS. But then I had a Habit burger and omg... let me just say that if I ever want a burger, I'm making the drive to Habit. P.S. they have the best onion rings ever and their ranch is the boooomb."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and haven't been very impressed. They nickel and dime you for everything $1+ for cheese, really?! Once I went through the drive through and the girl couldn't hear me or something and asked if I wanted a green bean drink?! What?!! I asked her if she trying to prank me be she kept saying it. Worst experience ever, not sure how they got my order right bc I had to tell her my order about 10 times, no joke. Food taste is average, price is above average."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but this is my 3rd time i make a comment about the salads being so skimpy. I ordered one to go and forgot to check it. I get home  and this is what i got. (Untouched) overpriced for what you're given."}
{"text":"Went to Habit for lunch. The place is very clean and layout was nice. Service was good and prices were in par with other places. Ordered a char burger and chicken sandwiches. Both were decent but not amazing. Fries were bland and had little taste. I only give this place a three out of five for the service but I won't return based on the food quality."}
{"text":"This is a hard review to write. My family loves a good cheeseburger and Freddy's or In-N-Out usually take care of those cravings for us. But we're always looking for something different and decided to try The Habit after seeing them in LA and having some friends recommend them. 

Service: Quick Service. Wait time to order even with 4 ahead of us in line was under 5 minutes. 
Pricing: Comparable to Freddy's Steakburgers, but definitely higher than In-N-Out. 

If you are looking for a good cheeseburger than you can change things up with The Habit is worth a stop. Want to try sourdough bread? No problem. Bacon? Avocado? Again no problem. Want onion rings or sweet potato fries? They've got you covered. Want to add jalapenos? You don't pay extra because they're at the side bar and you can add a few or load up with them. 

Decor: This is definitely a nicer step up from In-N-Out, and it doesn't feel like the zoo that Freddy's can feel like when it's busy. Once you place your order they hand you a pager that lets you know when your order is ready. I like that vs. having to listen for Guest # 143 your order is ready when there's a lot of other noise going on. 

And I would be amiss to not mention their speciality tea / drinks that are a pleasant surprise.

I'm giving them 3 Stars as I want to try them at different times of day and explore more of what they offer before bumping them to 4. But they definitely will get our return business. 

I highly recommend looking at the pics others have taken of the food so you can get a better understanding of what they offer. Portion sizes may look small, but you won't leave here hungry."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is how efficient and organized their process is! My burger was excellent and the super food salad is great! Service was awesome and the staff was very educated."}
{"text":"I don't often grab a burger. When I do though, it's at the Habit. I have come here for 2 years now. The burgers are consistently great. What keeps me coming back though is the customer service. 
They must take really good care of their staff, because they are always courteous, professional, and pleasant. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Been a regular since it opened.  Probably my favorite neighborhood fast-food burger joint.  Delicious, consistently good burgers and fries.  The fries are never soggy, always made fresh at order time.  Good milk shakes.  I'd argue they are better than Five Guys, In-n-Out, Fatburger, Smashburger...."}
{"text":"I will give it 3 stars because the cashier displayed excellent customer service and the place was really clean. The burger was just ok, tastes a fancier burger king. I wasn't a fan at all but kudos to the staff they were amazing. I wish I knew her name so I could give her a shout out!!"}
{"text":"Not bad and not great. It is surprisingly very clean and decently decorated for a casual burger place. I was expecting something super casual and almost divey, but that's my fault for not knowing much about this chain. Was the first customer for the day and everything was in place and clean. Ordered a Charburger with cheese and their Santa Barbara burger which has avocado in it and is served on toasted sourdough bread. The Charburger was ok, but the Santa Barbara was better. Probably because of the toasted sandwich bread. Service was fast and even offered free water cups while waiting. Guess they get pretty busy later because there was a roped off entrance where \"Line starts here\" next to me and still gave me pager even though I was the only one there. And yes, the pager shakes like it's angry when your order is ready. Would give this place another try."}
{"text":"Update
The store manager reached out to me to apologise and to offer char tickets for my next visit. I declined. I will go back and see if this visit was a one off and not the norm. I hope so. The burgers were quite good  on my previous visits. I upgraded this review to 3 stars. The management team here is striving for an awesome experience. I appreciate the offer for a free burger. I would prefer to try again anonymously.

My first review.
I asked for a Charburger with cheese and no lettuce. I got a Charburger with cheese and lettuce, no onions, no tomatoes, no pickles. The burger was well done and dry, I prefer medium rare. I was in the drive thru and read some of the reviews on Yelp. Not to good. Sounds like a training issue. I have been here before with no problems just seems like this visit was a little whacked. Maybe I got somebody else's burger. One star, the burger wasn't prepared correctly. The fries were very good!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a cheese burger and found this place on Yelp.  Had the Double Char #2 with fries and drink.  I enjoyed the unlimited peppercorns and chili peppers!  The burger was good but I didn't like the  french fries.  I will return for the burgers and peppers."}
{"text":"Meh...

Ok, don't get me wrong, it's a solid burger, but I think maybe I had very high expectations based on reviews and photos.  I will say this, if it were purely based on the fries I'd have given five stars; they were amazing.  

The \"charburger\" is what sold me, but I honestly didn't taste a lot of char.  I got the Double Charburger which is their big item and it just fell a little flat to me. 

I like that the ingredients are fresh and it's not McDonald's level fast food, but it's about ten minutes from me and I honestly wouldn't make it my business to go out of my way when I have In & Out and Five Guys right around the corner.  

I'd put it somewhere in-between In & Out and Five Guys.

Again, it was a solid burger, but there was nothing \"wow\" about it.  If you're near by, definitely stop in because it's better than most of the fast food options.  

If I'm near there again I will stop back in to try a malt and those green bean fries; they look really good."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service, one of our favorite places to eat!  I get the albacore tuna filet and my fiancé gets the char burger with fries, both are made fresh and taste amazing.  We always make it a point to eat here when we're in the area, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service.  In order the ahi sandwich and my fiancé gets the burger and fries.  Both are made fresh and taste delicious.  We make it a point to come here any time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Their chicken sandwich on sourdough is real good.  So are their burgers.  The fries are good, but nothing special.  Usually friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and was really surprised at this non-assuming burger restaurant. A friend recommended it and I met him here for lunch. I ordered the grilled chicken on a whole wheat bun with bbq sauce, lettuce, grilled onions, and tomato. It's cooked over a fire grill and was ready in about ten minutes. Probably one of the best gilled chicken sandwiches I have ever had. Nice restaurant with not quite enough seating though. Very busy at lunch time. The manager was very involved and helped remove the trays form the tables and came by to see if everything was good."}
{"text":"Just tried this place. Ordered the Chicken club which was so delicious. Fast service, good food, and my cashier/server Austin was literally the nicest person I've met at a food establishment! Would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say I love this new plaza and all of the new places (Pieology, Jamba Juice, Panera) that have taken up residence. Each restaurant including the Habit has a brightly lit outdoor seating area with umbrellas for shade as well as comfy seats and tables (with a nice view of the strip and surrounding area). The parking is a little tight so be prepared to drive around looking for a spot.

The Habit itself is clean inside and out; the employees are friendly; and the food itself is good. I got the #1 combo which came with deliciously crispy fries and a drink as well as the burger for $7 including tax. The burger was smaller than I expected but good (definitely better than most fast food but not as delicious as a fine restaurant on the strip). 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like that I can walk from my house and get a quality burger. This place always busy. I get the double char with no buns replace with lettuce."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and burgers here are amazing. There fries are always fresh and warm. You can place orders over the phone but they require you to pay up front. That's there only downfall in my opinion"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good burger place in Vegas and decided to go to The Habit because of the many positive reviews.  The restaurant is clean, employees are friendly and efficient, the burger was excellent, and their onion rings were out of this world!  And to top it all off, the prices are very reasonable.  We'll definitely be stopping here next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I walked in thinking the same old thing like lenny's or in and out but I was pretty wrong. You can watch them cook your burger and prep it before they serve it to you which is awesome! they also give you a little buzzer that go's off when your order is up so you know exactly when to go grab it. I got the teriyaki burger and my fiance just a regular combo it was delicious! The meat was cooked perfectly and piping hot, perfect drizzle of teriyaki sauce with a nice cut pineapple, the fries were perfect and crispy and the restaurant was warm and inviting; the staff even willing to wait while my fiance had to run to go grab some change from our car what's better?!  Oh wait i'll tell you, they have front parking for pickup orders and you can call your order in ahead of time so it's hot and ready to go when you get there. The prices are under 20 bucks for two combos and that's a steal Defiantly making the habit my go to burger stop from now on."}
{"text":"Worst Habit of them all. Sloppy looking employees. Poorly trained. Long waits. Inefficient. Uneducated on how to operate register. Constantly running behind on orders."}
{"text":"First time to Habit and I'm impressed. Great char flavor on the burger. The caramelized onions are a nice touch. Bun has a nice toast to it. Lots of shredded lettuce too. Overall I can see why Consumer Reports rated it the best tasting burger. Single with cheese is just $4.07 w tax. Love their pepper bar (whole jalapeños, pepperchinis and sliced jalapeños). Great service. Very clean. For those eating in they have some nice condiments like malt vinegar, steak sauce, a couple hot sauces etc."}
{"text":"Our New Years day lunch was pretty good at Habit Burger. The BF got the double char burger and I had the swiss and mushroom burger and we shared some onion rings and sweet potato fries.

The food was pretty good. I think it was a tad overpriced being that it wasn't anything fabulous but it was still good. They have a small self serve jalapeno and chili pepper station to spice yup you sandwiches. They also offer some bbq sauces, ketchup, and malt vinegar (which I love, btw). The sweet potato fries were slightly overcooked but the onion rings were really good. I hate when onion rings are loaded with breading and these ones weren't. The burgers themselves were pretty tasty but, like I said, nothing amazing, but not bad either. 

The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and the manager walked around asking how everyone's lunch was.

Overall it was good. Would we come back? Sure!"}
{"text":"Great cheap eats for the strip! Located on 3 rd floor of fashion show mall. The food court was great for meals under $10.00 considering the strip hotels will charge $20 for eggs and toast. I had the fries $2.15 and the BBQ Bacon Burger-$ 4.95 the fries where medium size but great tasting. I'd give it an 8 out of 10. The burger hit the spot. It was refreshing to see it actually being cooked on site and not microwave. They have a full condiment bar so you can dress your burger and sandwiches to your liking. The also offer salads sandwiches and vegetarian options. The portobello mushroom burger looked delicious! Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing !!! I always get the chicken grilled sandwhich on sour dough and lite bqq! It's so good And the fires are amazing and really crispy/crunchy ! Staff very friendly"}
{"text":"The was my second visit to a Habit Burger as before, it did not disappoint. Juicy, flavorful burger. Yum!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant when I'm craving a burger. I have been to numerous Habit Burger locations and have never been disappointed. Each location has been consistent in quality, cleanliness, friendliness, and great food. I would classify myself as a burger connoisseur and Habit Burger rates as one of my favorites."}
{"text":"You need to eat here. Great food and incredibly reasonable prices. Burgers are awesome and fries are even better."}
{"text":"Always love coming here with my family. The burgers are delicious and the tempura green beans are amazing. The shakes and malts are perfectly made each time."}
{"text":"Yeah I'm down with this place. I got the chicken salad and my husband got the double char cheeseburger. He had been here before and couldn't wait to take me. We also got our son a single hamburger. He enjoyed it (he's only 17 months and a picky eater, so I was so pleased he liked it!). My salad was huge and very filling. My husband loved his burger. The fries were good but I was a little disappointed when I saw the guy behind the grill pulling out frozen fries and putting them in the deep fryer. What do I expect from a chain restaurant, but still. Fresh cut fries would be nice."}
{"text":"My coworker and I just left there. It was my first time trying this place and it was pretty good. I checked it out online before I went and people compared it to In N Out. To, me The Habit is better by far especially their fries. My burger was a little pink inside but not enough to make a fuss about.  The only drawback today was the landscapers. Seemed like everytime I started talking, he'd fire up the saw he was using lol.  Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"GOOD
The place is spanking brand new.  Located next to raising canes on Craig and Losee.  Nice to see a stand alone building go up in this area...

The food is made to order...so everything is hot and fresh.  It took like 10 minutes for a tri-tip sandwich at walk in. 

Bread was buttery and crispy for my sandwich.  The tri-tip was cooked medium well and they didn't skimp on the meat either.  Overall a tasty sandwich in my opinion for the price.  

The decor is Cali inspired due to its origins of the establishment.  Plenty of seating and inviting to dine in...

They offer brew teas...not fake tea. Also fountain drinks of coke products. Liked that they had a selection of juices with ginger and peach infused water based products.

BAD
the staff was new and a little slow on register due to being new.  
Neither of the 2 staff I encountered at register had sampled the tri-tip or grilled tuna sandwiches.  Maybe management could have the employees sample the menu...just saying?"}
{"text":"Update to my many updates: So I found a burger that has changed my opinion, lawd am I happy! I told myself I wasn't going to give the burgers here another chance but I stumbled across the Roasted Garlic Portabella Char and fell in love.  It may look small to the eye but this is a lot of burger, layers upon layers of goodness... each bite better than the last... no exaggeration. This flavorful beast has portabella mushrooms, melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, pickles, and roasted garlic aioli (that doesn't taste too mayonnaise-eee) on a toasted bun. Throw in some hot peppers from their pepper bar and it's sure to be an experience that will linger in your mouth way after you're done eating! No literally. 

Tip: Bring your appetite and breath mints!"}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time about two weeks ago. I've been to The Habit around LA, but totally forgot that one existed here (even though I work literally right across the street!) 

The location is in a great shopping center, and it is rather small, but it was not too packed while I was here. I took my order to go, I got their original charburger with fries, which has always been my favorite when dining at this establishment. Love the consistency. My burger was delicious and my fries were nice and crispy. I haven't eaten here in a while so I forgot how AMAZING their fries are. 

Can't wait to come back! I'm definitely going to have to try their salads and fish sandwich next time. 

P.S. - definitely try their strawberry limeade. It is probably the best I've ever tasted, I believe they add cucumber to it as well! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant had an odd and off putting smell and we should have turned around right away. The burgers were similar to cheap frozen patties doused with pepper. The fries, again seemed as if the were frozen, having little flavor."}
{"text":"ZING. ZAM. ZOWIE. WOW. This is a GREAT new spot, with dangerously fantastic burgers, salads, and other assorted sandwiches at crazy-low prices! I had the Double CharBurger with Cheese ($4.50) which is quite similar to an In-N-Out double double, but flame grilled and a bit more substantial.. which equates to PERFECT, when it comes to my ideal burger. Also had a Ceasar Side Salad ($3.95) which well... was just that... nothing special, but fresh, and served the purpose. Co-diners were very happy with their salads/burgers as well.  Fries are very good, if not a bit on the average side. Staff is hellbent on making sure you're happy, and the experience is much calmer and enjoyable than Five Guys (similar concept).  Also, major points for having such a relaxing, expansive, enjoyable patio."}
{"text":"Visited this location using the drive-thru. Not going inside seemed to have been a huge mistake. After being annoyed by the person going over the top with the verbal communications to verify that they had captured the order correctly, we waited for an easy 15 minutes before receiving our order. Not bashing the worker, because I am sure this is the way things are trained, but that does not make it any less annoying. Why would a new location not have one of those fancy screens in the drive-thru if they want to do order verification for every single item ordered.  So, we ordered a couple of burgers with fries, and my biggest gripe is the amount of lettuce put on the burger. Yes I will have some meat with my lettuce burger. Thanks!  To make this experience even more memorable, I could not find a single napkin in my bag to catch any of the lettuce that fell into every single nook and cranny in my vehicle. May stop again if I am in the neighborhood, but will definitely hold the lettuce and ask for napkins."}
{"text":"Nothing like a free meal, right?! My husband, daughter and I were one of the first 200 in line to receive a full meal (burger, fries, and drink) as part of a 'grand opening' event they were having. Delicious hamburgers, made fresh to order like In-N-Out style and then some. We were even gifted two free vouchers for their original CharBurger for later use. The service was excellent, food was hot and fresh and there were happy tummy's all around to say the least. Can't wait to return and try more of the items on their menu."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the 3.5 overall star rating of this place. For the price, and considering its a fast burger, this place is tops! I live nearby and eat here about every couple of months to satisfy my quick burger fix. The food is always good, and the restaurant is one of the best run franchised operations in the valley. The staff is always so kind, appear to be happy, and they're all well put together. Kudos to the owner and staff of this place."}
{"text":"Not bad food. Tried calling in an order tonight as I was driving but no dice, they wanted a credit card # up front. As I finally ordered in the store I pointed out to the cashier that this wasn't fun and got crickets.... 'not my fault, call center is in Nevada'."}
{"text":"I love this place! We've only been here twice & both trips were fantastic. We've gotten the double burger combos, both trips & the amount of food is huge. Service is super quick & they are incredibly accommodating. Kids meal was big enough to share for a 5 & almost 2 year old. My husband, myself and 2 kids ate for $22 & food was sit down restaurant quality! So happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this location once before with my dad through the drive thru and now today with my sister. This time was busier than last time, but I have no complaints. I am actually really happy with the service I received today. My sister had never been to the Habit before, and I told the cashier that it was her first time. The cashier, Evelyn (I believe this is her name), she was so kind and explained everything to my sister in a fast and concise manner; even when it was busy. The food came out within less than 10 minutes and was the exact way that we ordered it. I really have to applaud this cashier though, because she showed her hard work ethic by going around and picking up trash and trays from the tables. She even asked how everyone was doing, like a server. I want to say that I do not know this girl in any manner, just wanted to recognize this amazing location and it's employee. Thank you Habit in Avondale, our family will be back soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  My Charburger had diced, caramelized onions and shredded lettuce. The sweet potato fries were crisp on the outside; sweet and salty.  The vanilla cone tasted richer than McDonald's ice cream, and the shape made me feel like the Statue of Liberty.  Not that she eats her fiery torch, but if it was Habit Grill ice cream cone, she would!  
They give you a timer that vibrates, lights up and buzzes when your order is ready.  Even if you are deaf and blind, you know when your meal is ready.  Nice touch!
I was here on a weekend, and although it was busy, the staff kept up with the flow of people.
Two things about the ice cream:  the consistency was thicker and denser than Mickey Dee's, so there was an air pocket inside the cone, which was disappointing.  I attribute that to an inexpert cone filler.  Also, I'd like a choice of flavors.  Strawberry and chocolate come to mind.  Overall though, I walked away very happy."}
{"text":"Delish!  Just opened in my neighborhood and I've heard about it before.  Very tasty Hawaiian burger and I loved the fries.  Prices were good too!  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"First time diners here. My wife ordered the grilled Ahi Tuna sandwich and really enjoyed it. I ordered the Char 1 with sweet potato fries. The burger was good, but not great. I can't really pinpoint any difference from other burger places like In & Out, Culver's, etc. It was certainly good, but I just didn't notice anything that made it special. The sweet potato fries were also good, but again, nothing that you can't get at other burger joints. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were courteous and friendly. Wait time for food was average."}
{"text":"I've only been there once and I enjoyed myself. I went with my kids and they loved it! 

While the burgers were good, and my 11 year old felt like Habit would give IN N OUT a run for their money, I think we most enjoyed the ambiance. Indoor and outdoor seating perfect for this time of year and the music was nice; comfortable. The restaurant, condiments and restrooms were clean and well kept. 

The burgers were good, its apparent the ingredients are fresh. The fries and the onion rings are frozen, yet are good and were crispy! I will be returning to try more on the menu! Its perfect for the kids burger craving and salad for my weight watching!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Great food.  Got the bacon burger and it was the bomb.  Wife got the tri tip sandwich and it was even better than the burger.  Salads are huge.  Even though I was full when I was done, I still wanted more.  Highly recommend this place.  Service was great as well."}
{"text":"The service is always super friendly! Me and the husband are fans of this place because the burgers alone are so well-priced. It's a great place to have lunch with friends with a classic burger menu."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  Love the service and food here!  Always super clean even during rush hour'"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great customer service and everything tastes so good! The Grilled Chicken Caesar salad is the best that I have had!"}
{"text":"Really really really enjoyed the tuna sandwich on sourdough! Such a great flavor and not sure what the sauce was but it was perfect. There tempura green beans were pretty dang good as well. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! They have so many options! The first time I went I ended up getting way too much food because I couldn't pick between all the great choices. I got the mushroom swiss burger, onion rings, fries, and a side salad. The burger was cooked perfectly, the fries were great, onion rings delicious, and the salad was good. Two small reasons they don't get 5 stars, one is the burgers didn't seem to have any seasoning on the meat. There was salt and pepper available but I prefer when it is cooked into the patty. The second reason was that the side of ranch they give with the salad was not enough for the salad. Other than those two tiny reasons everything was great!"}
{"text":"Well I Entered the Establishment it was Clean and organized and  amazing. I  Was Greeted By Lizett and She had a wonderful smile and Full of energy and  She Did and amazing Job taking my Order and its was Correct.the Manager on Duty Name Suzett made me Feel welcome She Address any Concerns I've had  And promised me Good Customer serivce and  They Delivered Her Staff Did and amazing Job preparing my Food and a Fast and Timely manner I Would Highly Recommend Visting this Location Cause You will Love the Saff and the Energy is Great."}
{"text":"This place was really good for a fast casual chain. It was a little on the pricey side - Comparable with 5 Guys.. but the cashier was friendly and informative. Food came out quick and someone even checked on us. We would go back."}
{"text":"Last night with my son and 
His girl Friend 
First time in the restaurant 
Great food and excellent srvc.
Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I've loved The Habit Burger Grill since I first had it in Cali. The price is right. The food is good. It's simple & tasty. Staff is nice & the food comes out pretty quick. It's not the most amazing burger if you're looking for something fancy or creative but if you enjoy a classic burger & fries then you'll love it."}
{"text":"First time here! I ordered the tempura green beans, which by the way are really good!  I would go back just for that! I also ordered the tuna fish burger and wow I've never had a burger like that and super tasty! Their strawberry lime aid is super tasty as well. It's a really good modern burger place."}
{"text":"They'll make any burger bunless!! That makes me happy any day. I've only been once but I wouldn't mind going again. Everything tastes super fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"No frills, Just burgers.
Small menu but very good.
I had a burger with regular fries.
Tasty and well cooked.
Bathroom has a changing table, which dangles over the toilet..that can be weird.
I'm left handed, so my daughter's head is over the toilet. Super weird.
Besides that..very clean, friendly service.
Moderately priced."}
{"text":"Good burger but slow service. They seem to want to have a line so they rarely open a second register with the result being it frequently takes longer to order than it takes them to cook your burger. 
If you are on a rush think about going somewhere else"}
{"text":"this place is absolutely amazing they hit it out of the park. Customer service,  cleanliness, and last but not least, the FOOD is absolutely amazing. the price is extremely reasonable as well... AND a drive thru?? oh boy this place is gonna make me fat. hahaha"}
{"text":"Alright, I'm always up for a good burger, so when a coworker pitched me on giving this place a try I was all in.

I ordered a #1 with cheese and all the standard toppings. It wasn't bad, but kind of average for a burger. If you are going to sell yourself as a \"burger grill\", you need to have a product that \"wows\" your customers. I can't say that about this burger. The meat was slightly undercooked and the flavor was just okay.

The french fries were actually really good - they reminded me a little bit of McDonald's fries, but thicker in size. Seasoned about the same.

I would go here again if I were with a group of people that already had their mind made up, so don't think I'm completely ripping these guys. I just don't understand the other reviews giving these guys high marks - seems a bit overrated.

If you really want something good, though, I would steer you to Five Guys, Zipp's or Uncle Bears before I would send you here."}
{"text":"There are so many burger joints in this town now its nucking futs.  In & Out is in the same parking lot and I am going there for sure next time.  Habit had some good burgers.  My dad and I both liked what we had but both thought there are many better burgers in this area.  We both liked the toasted buns, fries, and rings.  It is worth trying but I am not going to be running back.  On a side note, they should really include the cheese in the price of the burger.  They upsell everyone and that is bs to not just include it."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I always get a veggi burger and onion rings and I've yet to be disappointed. Affordable and clean with a simple menu that's got options for everyone.
I'd say the most impressive part of this location was the manager. Young guy with a full sleeve tattoo not only provided outstanding customer service to every guest but single handily kept the entire restaurant clean at a very busy lunch rush.

This has become my stand bye for a quick meal."}
{"text":"The drive thru took 40 minutes!  I don't care if the burgers are good.  I had to repeat a two burger meal order three times because they couldn't get onions vs fries vs cheese or no cheese.  I was trapped in takeout land.  Not doing that again it is ridiculous."}
{"text":"yo Habit bomb. who else has a tuna burger for a price like that?? matter of fact, who else has a food selection this vast at this quality for a price like that? 

in my lengthy experience as an out of shape person who eats fast food on a somewhat regular basis, a burger from Habit beats out Whattaburger, Shake Shack, and Smash Burger easily. It may beat out In-n-Out honestly. its really close. i need to think about it more actually. this was premature to type. ya know what? nvm it is better than In-n-Out. how's that for a HOT TAKE! call me Skip Bayless. 

but seriously, these fellazzz have a bomb burger. plus, you can make it teriyaki. which obviously i did. ya know what? i originally had my rating at 4 stars but i am changing it to 5 bc teriyaki sauce. if you are a burger place in 2017 and you aren't doing teriyaki burgers, why are you in business? how can you be so backwards?

also, these guys have malt vinegar at their condiments bar. fries need malt vinegar. you need habit burger. i need to calm down. no, what i need is Habit burger. gonna go to Habit burger right now."}
{"text":"Ahwatukee has seen a lot of burger shops pop up lately and this one is a good one.

Originally from Santa Barabar, Ca these people have figured out how to make a good burger.

Toasted bun, less than 1/4 patty (so if you are a big eater, get the double), lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, pickles and mayo.  This is a pretty good combo as it comes but I added mustard (I like it spicy) and cheese (extra fat = extra taste).

I'm not a huge eater and this one patty was more than enough, especially since I ordered fries. 

Fries are good - good size in fry length and quantity.  They do offer sweet potato fries but I have not tried them yet.

They offer a chicken, fish and meatless option as well.

If they had a drive-thru I would probably be here more often!! (hint)"}
{"text":"Great food and service for the price! Employees are very helpful and kind. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a quick bite that is way better than other fast food establishments."}
{"text":"Decided to bring the wife after having Habit burger in California, told her how good it was and ensured she would love it .  

Well I was wrong , guess the older locations have learned how service works. Pretty simple order 2 burgers one with everything one plain, 2 fries , 2 shakes. Not to hard.

First attempt,  both burgers with everything on them, brought it to the employees attention, he   apologized and took them back. I then heard him say can you just pull off the lettuce tomatoes and mayo to the cook. Wtf if that's all you were gona do I would have just done it. 

He then brings me just one burger and says did you not grab the rest of your order , I politely inform him that he took the hole tray with him? 
He then come back with my wife's order , but still no shakes , ( the hole time he has the receipt in his had). Then asks why didn't you grab them , they weren't ready. He then goes to get them. 

In the end we got my messed up burger , my wife's order , and shakes, still missing my fry.

The food was good  not great but good , my wife got the BBQ bacon burger , it was not hot and she wasn't impressed. 

The best part was the shakes , but don't think anyone would come just for the shakes. Probably give them another try one day but won't be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"The burgers here are delicious. The Santa Barbara style burger is served on sourdough toast.. It comes wth two char burger patties.. Always juicy, cooked just right.. Loaded with avocado, grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles, they cut it down the middle and is big enough to share..

Or if a classic burger is what you're craving, you can't go wrong with the original charburger. Also served with grilled onions. 

I paired mine with the tempura green beans, they are light and crispy .. Not greasy at all. Served with a side of ranch. 

The onion rings are really good also. Not greasy and fried just right.

Topped off with a strawberry limeade at the beverage counter and you will leave here one happy customer..."}
{"text":"This place isn't half bad.  What they lack in some areas they make up for in others, and overall, not a half bad place.  The Habit is more of a fast casual dining experience, where you order at the counter and they have you pick up your food when it's ready.  The place is well decorated, colorful and had a decent menu selection to choose from.  Prices are fair, but I did have a few issues with how they rang up my order.

For starters, you can get a basic burger combo for $5.95.  This includes fries and a drink.  Awesome!  Plus, you can refill your drink a lot, which is a bonus since I go through a bit of pop when I eat out.  The down side?  If you want anything else but the regular fries, its going to cost you, and that upset me.  I didn't want the regular fries and I wanted sweet potato fries instead as a treat.  The down side?  They charged me a la carte for my order instead of the value meal price, so my order was twice as much as I was hoping it would be.  I think the sweet potato fries ended up being $2.95, or something ridiculous like that.  I mean, I understand an extra 50 cents, but really?  a la carte? UGH.  I mean, the foods good, but not THAT good.

Service here was nice and friendly.  The manager walked around to make sure we were happy with our order, and the food was filling and tasty.  I like it as an alternative to fast food, and it was a great quick meal.  Next time I'm here, I think I will stick with the regular fries since I didn't like the extra charge.  Not a half bad place.  It's worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"It was a good as any Habit.  Tasty burger and fries.  Lots of friendly employees."}
{"text":"An upscale fast food burger joint with more ambiance that the in-and-puts and Five Guys. GREAT burgers with quality ingredients... burgers were juicy and the lettuce and onions on them were beyond expectation. Onion rings were also a hit. 

Certainly worth making a stop, just as good as five guys and much cheaper!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, helpful and friendly staff,  quick service! Beats any other burger place in town"}
{"text":"I got the double bbq bacon char burger and got a side of onion rings.  They were both really good for being a fast food. The food came out quick."}
{"text":"I didn't order a full blown meal, I did order a kids meal, and the portions were pretty great for a kids meal. Only 4$ for it and I got a pretty decent sized burger, side of kids onion rings and a very tasty strawberry shake for that price. I was happy with that little kids meal and if you like your kids meals like I do as a grown woman then this is kids meal wonderland for you! Check it out, portions are great, shakes are tasty and onion rings were delicious and crispy!"}
{"text":"I went to see how their burgers compared to In n Out.  No comparison, In n Out is way better across the board.  Not terrible, but I just prefer In n Out."}
{"text":"Great food. And a reasonable price. Ordered the mushroom charburger and fried green beans. Both were great. Kids got nuggets and fries and loved it."}
{"text":"Had a bun-less double char with cheese... Most flavorless patties I've had in a long time. Also they didn't \"wrap\" the burger like other places which means much of the spread comes out the back. It's important because a bun would absorb and hold the spreads and tomato. Worst of all, their water tastes like cold pool water. Completely undrinkable."}
{"text":"Wow! I had the tri tip steak on a French roll with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and a teriyaki drizzle. On the side I ordered their sweet potato fries and homemade strawberry lemonade with cucumber.

The steak was soooooooo soft and it melted on my bun. It was grilled at a perfect medium.  They also have burgers, salads and malts. My taste buds were ok heaven."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time since I've been hearing a lot about this place. I had the double charburger with avocado and no onions. The wait wasn't long at all and it was pretty delicious. The fries were tastey as well and it's an appropriate amount of fries. I'd recommend going here definitely."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite burger joint, that is NOW in Vegas!! Discovered this chain 7 years ago in Ventura after skydiving in Santa Barbara on my bday, and have been hooked ever since. You can taste the quality and freshness in the ingredients. This Vegas location is consistent."}
{"text":"These burgers, to me, are much too similar to In-and-out for me to justify spending the extra dollars on them.

They weren't bad. By any means. But they tasted like slightly higher quality fast food, nothing special about them.  After seeing all the rave reviews I was excited, but left dissapointed and underwhelmed.

The ambience is casual, but very nice and inviting for a fast food establishment. That alone gets it a star.  They do have an outdoor patio.

What my stars mean: 

5 is outstanding, a must-experience, someplace I would bring/recommend to a tourist

4 is great, someplace I would love to go back to again and again. Backup options to bring/recommend to a tourist 

3 is good. Someplace I would return to if in the area. I probably wouldn't recommend to a tourist, but possibly to a local. 

2 is ok but only because it is either cheap or convenient.

1 means I would not return"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good with above average burgers and I thought that the tempura green beans were pretty good too.  But I can't see what all the fuss that folks are making about this place.  Habit Burger is good, not great.  If nothing else the girl behind the counter needs to learn how to speak more slowly and clearly.  I know she has to say the same thing over and over, but the customer needs to hear and understand her.  So I give this place 3.5 stars and will probably be back if I want a burger and am not closer to Fuku Burger."}
{"text":"The Habit is basically a glimpse into what true burger connoisseurs wish In N Out would become: a menu that remains small and simple, but isn't afraid to spice things up with a few toppings. We've got some limited selections that should cater to anyone here. I personally love BBQ sauce & Bacon on mine, so I'm glad to see that as a staple here. There are veggie burgers, complete with many fresh toppings as well as a whole-grain bun. And for something unique, there's one with avocado on sourdough bread. 

The fries are pretty good, and soon I'll need to try the onion rings or green bean fries. 

The strawberry-cucumber lemonade (see? improving on In N Out once more) is absolutely divine. 

If you wanna get a standalone burger, it could be under 5 bucks. It's a notch above fast food, but nowhere near as costly as its competition in Smashburger, The Counter, Five Guys, etc. That's good. 

Of course, a glaring flaw is I believe to be the burger patties themselves gray and boring. I mean, it's still good, and I'm glad they dress everything up...but still. Can you *try* to season these? (No they won't, as this is a chain.) They're mediocre, with firmness that suggests they're frozen, which is lame when no one else seems to be doing that. Everything else is on point, but you *have* to care about the beef itself to earn more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"The Habit Burger's signature is charbroiling their burgers, and it is just about the only thing that distinguishes Habit from any of the other thousands of burger joints that have sprung up in the last few years.  

The burgers do have a strong \"char\" flavor which I find agreeable as a change from, say, juicy.  

Everything else here is just like every other similar joint.  The ambience is clear but sterile, the staff is polite but obviously bored, the fries are mediocre (except for good onion rings), the drinks are uninspired.  You get the idea.

Still I will return, very occasionally, to get my fill of char."}
{"text":"Kinda expensive, just ok.  Rather have 5 guys or in and out.  They want me to say more but that's all I got."}
{"text":"The family has eaten here a couple times and we have been impressed. No complains and I'm a pretty picky burger eater lol"}
{"text":"First Timer. Wow. That was some fantastic hamburger. It did remind me alot of Five Guys, but I think I would put this place just a wee bit above it. No offense to Five Guys, I'll continue to go there as well. Came in right after doors were opened, so the place was open clean. The service was very good. Very friendly counter people. I like the style of the place. Very comfortable and unassuming. I know that I will be a duke here very soon as I plan to frequent this place, time permitting of course. Very nice job. Plus I love it that they have the diet lemonade in the fountain machine. Can't wait to introduce this place to my wife. She's a burger freak."}
{"text":"For only being open a few weeks, this store did wonderfully, from the service and cleanliness, to the food. Excellent job!"}
{"text":"For our office lunch we decided to give The Habit Burger Grill a try. From that lack of talking and full mouths I would say everyone approved. 

I heard that they have a hard time answering the phone, so I shouldn't try to pre order, just go in and place the order there, a little disappointing, I hate having to wait around when I need to get back to the office quickly. But I went and ordered there anyway. Their waiting area for your food is nice. I was able to load up on some jalapenos and peppers to take back to the office while I waited. The food didn't take long at all, about 6 minutes or so. 

The grill and kitchen are open and visible to the entire restaurant, sometimes this can be scary, but here it really works. No sneaky nose picking!

A few people got the Albacore Tuna sammies and I got the #1 lunch special, a basic cheese burger and onion rings and a drink. The burger was fantastic, nice bun, great veggies and they even grill the onions! The onion rings were okay, at best, I would guess they buy them frozen. 

The best part of all, other than the sammies being yuuuuummy!, was the price. It is a-la-cart, but if you just want a cheese burger (Charburger) it's only gonna run you $2.95, winning! All the burgers and sandwiches are under $4 or $5. They also have some good looking salads, and the sweet potato fries are amaze-ballz! I totally should have gotten them instead of the O-rings. 

Very satisfies, I am excited to try the tuna next time. OH! And one of their shakes, they looked good too. But thanks to Jillian Michael's I am on a hard core work out regiment and cant splurge too much right now."}
{"text":"1st time eating here and everything was delicious. Got the regular Charburger with cheese and sweet potato fries. The employee brought be ranch to dip, 1st time I've done that and it was so good. All staff was very nice and they didn't charge me for changing my fries even after they already served me regular fries. Will certainly be back again."}
{"text":"Missed this place when I moved here to Vegas and am so happy we have one now.  Same great taste and the staff here is exceptionally nice and attentive.   Only thing it's missing is the pastrami but i guess its a Ventura county thing only"}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing. Being from California I really like in and out burgers. With this place puts them to shame. My husband loves their shakes as well. Our favorite place to stop for a quick bite when in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Visited the place after church yesterday evening (9/11/11).  Not really sure if they were officially open yet since they had a pre-opening  charity lunch early in the day.

First impression:  they completely transformed the old space (Unlimited Coffee) into a fresh, bright & modern food joint.  Although I found it small, I'll give them a pass since they only have that much real estate to work on the former cafe.  The only other thing I also noticed, there were a lot of employees.  Most of them cramped inside the counter area.   Must be THE training day!

On to the food:  we ordered a mushroom burger, a Charburger and a double Charburger, side ceasar salad, sweet potato fries and drinks - rang at about $20 with tax.  We were impressed with the taste knowing that we just saw them grill those patties on a barbeque grill (not a flat grill). Some people may or may not like that way but we personally like how they grill it similar to how Original Hamburger Works does it.

We sat at the outside patio area which should be good during the times when the weather is much nicer.  Yesterday though, it was a bad decision since we saw the haboob fast approaching from the east (can't see Squaw Peak from where we are seated).  Made us chew our burgers faster :)

I think this joint is a welcome addition to the CenPho neighborhood.  More burger competition can only mean better things for us diners.  We will definitely come back again.  Next time will probably try the entree salads or the tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"One of our local go to favorites. Whenever we're in the mood for a burger this place answers the call."}
{"text":"I love this place ..great burgers ,fast and friendly service. I had onion rings with my burger instead of fries and the server gave me ranch automatically so that a plus lol. I really enjoyed the char burger and they have the side jalapeños and chili peppers to add for free on you burger :) yummy"}
{"text":"This a great burger for the price. The price is comparable to most fast foods and the quality is far superior. The inside of the restaurant was also clean and well attended. Even though there was a line I waited a short time for the food. They also have a seating area outside (small patio) where you can bring your dog. 

I ordered their regular char burger with the onion rings. I appreciated that they offered ranch sauce for the onion rings. They also have a small area for you to pick extra condiments, including a variety of hot sauces and pickles. 

I would def come back to this place when I am craving an affordable and tasty burger."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place. Visiting rare as its rather expensive and not good for you. Ha ha."}
{"text":"Great food but nthe service was terrible. My wife and I both order a santa Barbara Char which comes with two patties. Hers got one. They took it back to remake it and when we got it back it still only had one. Then they insisted on arguing with us about the hamburger. They need better customer service."}
{"text":"Great burger for the price! Nothing fancy just good quick food and great juice infusions. It beats almost all Fast food burger places and better then Smash or Five Guys in my opinion."}
{"text":"GET IN \"THE HABIT\"

Stopped in this burger joint for lunch today and I'm really glad I did. I ordered an Albacore Tuna Burger and it was delish!!! The tempura green beans was even better and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Meh is all I can say .. I genuinely want to like this place but the onion rings still are lacking ..

They do have a decent variety of salads and burgers but this place didn't wow me .. this is my second or third time at this chain but this is first time in Vegas ..

Everything is an up charge but eh it's still a tolerable total ..

My bun was burnt and the onion rings totally let me down but the meat wasn't terrible and it's got a huge variety on the menu ..

The table we sat at was dirty but at least I was able to wipe it up ... overall this place is meh and I probably won't be back for a third time"}
{"text":"People were nice and restaurant was clean. Service time with reasonable and food tasted good.
But you're basically getting in and out burger in a nice place. So don't have too high expectations that this is a quality unique fresh special experience. You're still getting served on a Middle School cafeteria tray."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place before until my friend just mentioned it. The burger is right off the grill and the fries are to die for. I love the service and the ambience.  Great for groups and great for kids. Everyone should come here."}
{"text":"It's a step up from all the other burger places. The restaurant is nice and clean. The service is fast and the people are also nice. The food is fairly priced. I ordered the charburger with cheese. It was good. The beef seemed pretty good quality. There's different types of chilis to eat with the burger. I enjoyed my meal, will be back!"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood here in Phoenix.  I was looking forward to checking it out.

Burgers ... Just OK.
Milkshake ... Really good.
Service ... Just OK.
Sad to say I won't be back (unless all I'm craving is a milkshake). 

Culver's is much better for burgers and fries and their service is five stars  everyday.  Just say'in ..."}
{"text":"This location is the one on blue diamond. I came on a Saturday at 3:10 PM and there was a lot of seating room. 10 minutes later there was almost no seating room,  it got packed really quick.

The habit has in my opinion some of the freshest burgers I have tested. You get a lot of burger for a reasonable price.

I ordered one double charbroiled burger with cheese $4.85, one sweet potato fries $2.80, with one medium drink $1.90, the total after taxes was $10.33.

The Habit has been increasingly obtaining a following because of the reasonable prices and very delicious burgers they have. The nice thing is that they don't only sell burgers, they have sandwiches and salads as well which gives options to those who are not in the mood for a burger. 

If you haven't tried a Habit burger, I recommend you try one you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They've come a long way since opening in Santa Barbara in 1969!! Having lived in LA for many years The Habit was well, a habit! On a recent visit to Vegas was happy to discover this location. Parking lot was torture during the lunch hour but we eventually found a space and came in for lunch.

Staff attentive and friendly. Food solid as always."}
{"text":"So damn good! Reminds me of a burger joint we have back home. The char on the burgers is perfect, the melting cheese was absolutely glorious, and the crispy grilled bun kept everything contained in a wonderful package capable of causing even the strongest willed person a hospital inducing mouthgasm."}
{"text":"Great service from the cashier. Pleasant and professional.

Not a fan, my personal opinion is that a Big Mac has more flavor than this burger.

Onion rings were average don't think they are homemade. Fries standard and somewhat undercooked. The green beans were tasty and are freshly dipped in tempura batter before fried . Crispy, light and good dipped in their ranch.

I'm sorry to say it was a bland burger and sides not up to par. I can say I've tried it, but won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here, with my bf, based on Yelp reviews (3 stars) & thought it was going to be ok... And left very let down.  When we arrived, the line was long so we were excited to try it & it smelled delicious.  when we arrived at the order/cashier our order was taken with a smile:).  We found a seat outside on their patio with a misting system, that was great, sunce there was no sitting area inside.  Had we known that when we ordered our burgers that we were going to get a condiment ( a ton of mayo, another ton of lettuce, tomato, & pickles)  with a small burger patty, we would've gone somewhere else to get a decent burger."}
{"text":"Today was our cheat meal and we decided to try this new burger joint.. it's been open for a bit and Ive heard good things about the burgers so why not!? 

Service was super friendly and efficient, she helped us decide what to order after we told her it was our first time.. she gave us our paper & buzzer.. at 4:19. We waited...

And waited...

And waited...

And finally at 4:59 our buzzer went off. When my husband asked them if it was normal for us to wait 30+ for our food they said oh no! It's not, sorry you had to wait so long. 

To top that off, I ordered a mocha shake and hubs a chocolate shake, they didn't know which was which and basically said sorry! We got them mixed up and don't know which is which! 

We liked the burger, but we don't have time for that kind of wait...."}
{"text":"I got food for carry-out and it was very good.  I tried ordering my food over the phone but that was a big mistake because their were serious issues with this service.  However, I just showed up and then got my food to go.  The burger was very good and the fries were about average.  The prices were very reasonable and the customer service in person went more smoothly than over the phone.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good burger at a great price."}
{"text":"First time at The Habit. It was okay. The fries were the best thing. My Santa Barbara Char was just ok. Patties were small and tasteless. Im also not sure why they hate cheese but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered without pickles and tomato, there was a pickle.  Ordered as dine in but couldn't find a place to sit for just the 2 of us.  Service was friendly.  Seems fast food without drive thru.  In and out is better plus cheaper."}
{"text":"Food was okay. The wait just to order could have moved faster, so I hope they fix that.  I ordered a burger with only lettuce and pickles on it and when I picked it up, it had onions on it. because asking for a burger with only lettuce and pickles is difficult to make. The lady asked the cooks to fix it and they simple wiped off the onions and I watched them do it. Not the best service or food, but decent. Fries were overcooked, they had a dark brown color to it, the cooks should have looked at it and known they were overcooked. Not sure if I would return, maybe I might go back in a few years."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those, dont judge a book by its cover type of places. The outside looks a little sketchy, but the inside is welcoming and pretty nice looking for a burger shack!
    When I walked in, I was greeted with a very warm, \"hello, how are you?!\" 
They made it super easy to order. 
What I definitely loved about this place was the made to order burgers. Its not like other places where its frozen burgers being made, they use real meat! It was absolutely delish, and my stomach was doing millions of cartwheels of pure happiness.
I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my family. We got the char burger, teriyaki burger and kids chicken nuggets; all I can say YUMMY! We will be back. Everything was fresh and the wait was pretty quick considering how packed it was."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good burger and sides. Still not as good as In N Out but few places are. Love the sweet potato fries and chocolate malt.  I wish they had more options as to fixings but it was still ok and I will go back."}
{"text":"We ordered a Golden Fried Chicken Sandwich and Charburger w/ two order of fries. Pretty satisfied, not super good to the point I'm craving it again but satisfied. Great fries. That's always important lol. Wait was a little long but the food was fresh so it was worth it."}
{"text":"We have grown to like this place more and more.  

My daughter likes the veggie burgers - I'm almost positive they are Morning Star brand. 

It's always clean, the employees are always friendly and the ingredients are always fresh. 

We really like the patio. 

Great ice cream too."}
{"text":"I have to share this because it's pretty nuts. A metal clip was in my grilled chicken salad tonight!!!  And it's about the size of a walnut. Luckily I saw it before I took a bite of it. Usually, I don't have any issues with The Habit and everything is usually good. But this is crazy and had to share."}
{"text":"Excellent food, mediocre service. Ride wait staff ignorantly makes racial slurs against \"white bitches\" in Spanish assuming others don't understand Spanish. Won't return."}
{"text":"Great burger for a great price on the strip! Nothing fancy, but perfect if you're looking for something quick and simple. 
The fries were thick but crispy!"}
{"text":"Only ordered through the drive thru, I haven't gone inside the restaurant yet. We really appreciated the order taker taking the time to provide us recommendations as it was our first time. Delicious mocha malt and generous size. The trip tip sandwich was cooked well with slight pink middle. I wouldn't mind eating here again, but would not be first choice for burgers with available options on Craig."}
{"text":"Testing out the drive thru.   Let's see how this burger is.  
Teriyaki char burger.  Looks good taste awesome.  The pineapple is yuumy in it. This might become a Tuesday habit.  Fries are fries."}
{"text":"I ordered portobello char & green beans.   Yummy. Very good. Very nice location & decor."}
{"text":"My family and I went to The Habit for the first time tonight. The food was great and the prices were comparable to other places.  We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"We've been to the The Habit a few times since their opening in Phoenix. For the price, I have to say that the food is outstanding! The wait staff is friendly and helpful and everyone seems to be enjoying working there which seems to be a good sign for how a restaurant is run and how management treats the employees. 

I definitely recommend checking it out...great place! And, it's great to see a restaurant doing well in that location!!"}
{"text":"This place is all ways a great place to come for a fresh cooked burger.  we came to the habit last night because they have really impressed me.   they cook your burger to order when u come in.  Frys, onion rings, and deep fried green beans were piping hot, and the our burger were very juicy.   Just wish they where not so far from my house (16 miles), but it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"A few days ago we came to this location. Food was good, staff friendly, parking is a issue.  So I would have to pick time of day a little better to come back to this location, all though I still think they have a great freshly cooked and juicy burger at a very reasonable price"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Habit, but of all the Habit's I have visited the one on 7th Ave and McDowell all ways seems to be the best,   it seems that the Avondale location pre cooks the burgers and the all ways seem to be dry, and not as juicy as the other location I mentioned.  I said some thing to one of the workers and got the \"I am sorry to here that\" answer that tells me they don't care.  its a shame because the other location is almost 10 miles from my house.  When you go the Dbl char is the best."}
{"text":"1st time here. Burgers & fries were super fresh. But a bit crowded for a lunch crowd. 
Must try the Santa Barber style - sourdough bread, double burger, topped with avocado!"}
{"text":"The burger, fries, and onion rings all had a decent flavor. I felt that, like Five Guys, the portion is a little small for the price (compared to competitors Fatburger, Smashburger, In-N-Out, and the ASU favorite Chuckbox)."}
{"text":"Why haven't I come here sooner?!?!?! I live in this area! My husband found this place on Yelp and seeing the reviews, we HAD to try it. I love In and Out Burger and people keep comparing it to that, but they both have so much great food so I can't pick between the two. I feel like this place gives you more of a variety of burger. I LOVE LOVE LOVE their tempura green beans! WOW! Went great with my delicious, juicy Santa Barbara sandwich on a sourdough bread. I didn't get to try the burgers but my husband and sister said they were juicy, flavorful and it was like a taste of an authentic backyard grilled burger made with love. Flavors were blended to perfection. Onion rings had that flawless crunchy bite! Prices are reasonable as well.  Definitely a place I'll come back to over and over again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their chicken club sandwich, it is so amazingly tasty and I get it every time. The chicken is seasoned and cooked so perfectly every time, not to mention the perfectly toasted sourdough bread that it comes on. It's a definite favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this place in Vegas! I was a fan in California. The sweet potato fries are the best! Recommend this place if you're looking for a good burger and some fries."}
{"text":"So, I love a good burger.  For fast food, I like whataburger double, and in and out double. The best is homemade on the grill. That being said, I've tried the habit twice. I was very disapointed, again. Tiny pieces of meat. No flavor. So much shredded lettuce, than it fell all over the place. I was so disappointed again. I'm sorry, that's just how I feel."}
{"text":"Good charbroiled burgers at a reasonable price. Definitely worth your time for a quick lunch/dinner. :)"}
{"text":"This is probably 5th time we've been here and I don't know what happened but as far as the restaurant part I've never seen it so dirty. The drink area and the condiment counter was so dirty. Spills everywhere on the counter on the floor. Kind of like walking into a Circle K. And the girl at the register didn't know what she was doing and didn't know the menu either.  They started off good when they opened. I hope this is a one time fluke thing. I just hope our food will be ok too."}
{"text":"Really Great Burgers & Salads. I'm having trouble trying other things on the menu because I've found a couple of things that I absolutely love and it is hard to try something else when you have a serious craving before you get in the door!  And they have sweet potato fries!

My last salad was so big I couldn't finish it, so I decided to take the rest home for later  . . . a little midnight snack?  Popped the container in the frig, forgot about it and found it the next day. I thought it was a goner for sure. Still good, and the perfect amount for lunch a second day.

Postscript: As I was rinsing the container to put in the recycling bin, I noticed a little note on the bottom: \"Now it is your turn. Please recycle.\"  As I looked further it stated\" \"4 (graphic) bottles = this box.\" The Bottle Box.  Wow!  My little part of saving the world is recycling and getting others to do the same through example. 

Thank you HABIT for not only providing really good fast food, but also contributing to saving the world's environment."}
{"text":"I love this place! Definitely one of my staple lunch spots. I can get my burger wrapped in lettuce and I can add or subtract anything I want so it's always safe for my food allergies.

Highly recommended! Good prices, great food quality, service is friendly, and I have yet to see a mistake!"}
{"text":"The best and freshest burgers and great tasting fresh French fries in Scottsdale and Phoenix"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks ago because everyone had been talking about how good it was! The burgers were good, nothing special. There's definitely better burger places out there. The customer service was great, the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the staff eating food behind the counter. I work in the food industry and seeing somebody eating food behind the counter was extremely disgusting! I probably won't be returning or recommending it just because of that."}
{"text":"Decent, moist bruger, but I am confused by what all the rave is about? In consideration of quality, proportion, and price value, I would elect for In N Out over Habit Burger."}
{"text":"Decided to go to this place since i drive by it 10 times a week and i must say,  WOW,,,  very good burgers..  I have found my new favorite burger joint,,  move over In & Out,, you've been benched..  They use fresh ingredients and you can tell..  I did'nt give them 5 stars because i've gotta hold out for the perfect burger although it may not exist... I just wish there was more than 1 location.."}
{"text":"The husband is always the last to know.

So I work at Howard Hughes Center, and I always passed this place out, because I thought they just serve the regular burger, nothing special. Welp, they proved it wrong. What I ordered was double Char burger with 2 onion rings. Burger tasted pretty good, and the killing part was onion ring. their onion ring is fried perfectly, and I made a right decision that I got 2 of those. Now it became one of my favorite to go for my lunch. Highly recommend trying their onion rings no matter what.

Psst! They have ranch sauce too, so do ask for that with Onion rings!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Went their with my father and ordered a mushroom char burger and it was delicious. Prices are very good, 4.50$ for my burger and everything on the menu was under $7. If you want a good burger with a clean and modern look check this place out."}
{"text":"Habit is in the complex where I work, and it's definitely become a lunch time habit (I'm so punny).

Their burgers are delicious. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. I also enjoy the toppings. Everything tastes fresh, and because you can see them cooking, you know your food hasn't been sitting around. Since I'm one of those weirdos who tries to avoid bread most of the time, I also like that I can get my burger in a lettuce wrap, and its surprisingly not too messy. Side wise, I think the regular fries are okay, but the green bean tempura fries are amazing! 

The prices are also great. Even if I indulge in a side, I can still get out for about $8. I feel like it's hard to do that at any fast food place these days and actually feel satisfied with your meal.

While the food is good, the service is truly what makes it five stars for me. They are always quick and friendly at this location. I've been here several times for lunch and have never had less than excellent service."}
{"text":"Habit has quickly become my go-to on nights when I don't want to cook. The food always tastes fresh, and when I get green bean fries, I feel moderately healthy...even if they are actually tempura fries. And even if I get an extra ranch for dipping.

My favorite part of this particular location is the service. Not only are they fast, but they are always very friendly and greet you as soon as you walk in.
Price wise, I think it is a better value than similar quick serve burger joints."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Habit Burger & I ordered take out. 

Food: Ordered 2 Charburgers (added cheese, avocado, & bacon) meals. 1 french fries. 1 onion rings. 1 strawberry shake & 1 chocolate. Unfortunately, we did not receive the avocado ($1.29) or the french fries (they gave us sweet potato fries instead). All of the food that we did get was great. 

The restaurant was clean & the workers were very friendly. We do plan on going back again, because the food was good & it is really close to our house. Pricing is also pretty good. The restaurant would have gotten a five, if our order was correct. 

Overall, recommended."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly!!  Nice,  clean restaurant..  What more can u ask for..  I got the albacore tuna sandwich on sourdough and a Santa Barbara Cobb salad.  Both were very good"}
{"text":"Jan 20th we tried out our new \"The Habit Grill\". I'm attaching a photo which says it all. The burger looked better than the photo in the menu. The restaurant is very clean. Cool photos on the walls. Lots of seating with booths, tables, and tall tables. I really like the high table that seats a dozen people. People were sharing the table that didnt know one another. I really like that. Restroom was very clean. I have nothing bad to report. Definitely will go back!!!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Just another burger chain to add to the other 9,000 that we really don't need in the valley. I'll never understand why people get excited about this place. It's just OK at best."}
{"text":"I just got my food I ordered and have not eaten yet
It looks and smells amazing!
The staff is friendly 
Clean and fast service
Presentation is superb"}
{"text":"Love the veggie burger here!

Also fast & friendly service every time I have been there.

I have turned several of my meatlover friends on to the veggie burger here and they all liked it."}
{"text":"Yummy as usual! So glad this new location opened-now I can get my green bean fix easier;) NLV is finally steppin' up!"}
{"text":"3 stars for friendly service and decent food. 

My husband and I went to have dinner there the other night. We figured that this place had to be on point. The line is always wrapped around the building whenever we would go to Albertson's for groceries. So we gave it a shot. Being pregnant, I have had my infamous food aversions, so I no longer have a love for chicken. So I was looking forward to sinking my teeth into a nice, juicy, char grilled burger! 

Once we got home, we tasted our food. The French fries were stale and kind of chewy. Probably not their fault. French fries tend to get a little cold and stale once you get home from the establishment. I ordered the Garlic Portobello mushroom burger and my husband ordered the BBQ bacon burger. Well, they were pretty good. But honestly, I can live without ever having to eat there again. The burgers tasted like something you can get from Applebee's or TGIFriday's. Not bad, but nothing original or to run through the neighborhood screaming about. We will just stick to Smash Burger, Bachi Burger and In n Out for now on."}
{"text":"Pretty solid fast food burger place.  Their burgers and fries are on par with In N Out - only recommendation would be to cut down on the amount of lettuce as it accounts for about half the sandwich.  Service is generally good, but have had a few incorrect orders and some cashiers that have been less than friendly."}
{"text":"To start, food was delicious! I ate a Santa Barbara style burger and it was truly awesome! But it earned 5 stars for me by the service I've got. Staff was very kind and nice to me and my gf. When they noticed, by our accent, that we're from Brazil, we had a nice chat with the chashier and the manager, who was always around!

Recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"Hey now. Three stars means A-OK, okay? Will I make it a habit of coming here again and again? Probably not. When my subconscious is craving a burger, is this my first, second, or even third choice? No.

I debated between a 3 and 4 star rating because realistically this is 3.5* in my book. With that said, there is some pretty stiff competition in the burger scene in Las Vegas.

While customer service, cleanliness, and efficiency of receiving the food (despite being busy) are an A+, the food just lacked the oomph.

Items tried:
Santa Barbara style - the description alone sounded like a burger I would like. 
It is a double char burger with cheese and avocado on grilled sourdough. I love avocado, but that is all I tasted. No other notes of anything shining through. No crack sauce. $5.95. 

Teriyaki char - pretty good taste overall! There's that sauce I was looking for. It's not too salty or sweet, it's just right. What upsets me is how teeny tiny the pineapple was. The pineapple was flat, thin, and dry. I guess the only positive is that they use fresh pineapples because of it's irregular shape and poorly cut portion. It's definitely not your standard pineapple ring from a can. I feel guilty for even wishing I had one of those canned pineapple rings in my burger. I think a bigger, juicier pineapple would have elevated the flavor of the burger. $3.45 + cheese $0.55 

Albacore tuna filet sandwich - this is prepared medium. For sandwiches, there is a choice of bread: French roll, grilled sourdough, or wheat bun. I only sampled this, since it was my husband's order. It was really good! Not fishy at all. I was more impressed with the sandwich than the burgers. $6.95 

Tempura green beans - different, but good! What a neat way to eat your veggies. My kid enjoyed this one. $2.95

Mocha shake - consistency was off. It was a little more chocolate-y than expected. I regret not trying the coffee shake instead. $3.25

Beware of the corporate lunch crowd. It can get pretty busy. 

Healthier options include a lettuce wrapped burger AKA \"protein style,\" veggie burger, and six different salads. 

Looking to try more of the sandwiches on future visits."}
{"text":"My first time. First impression, this is a better burger chain. It would take several visits for me to compare Habit to In 'n Out, Smash Burger, Five Guys etc. So I will go with the menu and the house habits. 

 I ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich on sourdough and fries. $6. Fries. $1.80 My sandwich was really good. Eating in the car was a mistake tho. Meat falls out and one of the tooth picks in the sandwich wound up in my mouth.

{"text":"I made my first visit to The Habit last night. It was a very tasty burger. They make them fresh so it's nice and hot and juicy. They do a fabulous lettuce wrap. The manager told me they will do any of their sandwiches as a lettuce wrap. Their tuna is sushi grade so I think I'll try that next visit. I also had the tempura green beans which were great and the shakes are made of real ice cream not just a mix out of a machine. Great value for the price!!!"}
{"text":"The only place I can get a decent veggie burger.. I have yet to find any other restaurant that has a decent veggie burger. Fills you up too! I love coming here alone and eating.. but I just hate how they're always playing depressing greys anatomy type of music. It makes me start thinking a lot about life.. However, Workers are very sweet and nice and go above and beyond!"}
{"text":"So we had to try this place to see what everyone keeps talking about and that it's a CALI franchise?. They said it was a mix between In n Out, Five Guys, and Smash Burger. To tell you the truth there was nothing about this place that stood out to me bc most of the items we tried lacked flavor. Prices are aren't too bad. Combos range from $6-$11 each. 

Albacore Tuna Sandwich - The sandwich was greasy to the touch but had a nice crisp toast to it. Tuna had a nice sear to it. Came with tartar sauce on the side but even with the tartar sauce it lacked flavor and needed seasoning. 

BBQ Bacon Charburger - good

Mushroom Swiss Burger - good

Fries - blah ..could use salt or seasoning. Was soggy with no crunch or texture to it

Tempura Green Bean Fries - nice crunch to it but lacks flavor. A little salt goes a long way 

Onion rings - probably my favorite thing in the menu that I've tried so far. Perfectly cooked. Nice and crunchy

Strawberry limeade - has that perfectly sweet tartness to it

Would I come back to try other things on the menu? Yes. Did it have the wow factor to make me have to crave for it. No."}
{"text":"Food is good. Giving it 3 stars because there are a bunch of flies flying inside the restaurant while we're eating."}
{"text":"I ordered the Char Burger and French fries. It was really good. I didn't want it to end. I was surprised by how it looked inside which has a modern burger diner feel. Plenty of room inside and out. I tried the Peach & Ginger Nectar. It was an interesting drink. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"More food on the floor than on tables.  Cmon guys, get it together.  The place is busy, but not that busy.  It won't be busy for long if you can't keep your small but nice place clean.  I feel like I'm in an upscale McDonald's right now."}
{"text":"Took my son here after some shopping we both enjoyed our burgers and my son really liked the fries.  We finished up with shakes that were just ok"}
{"text":"Burgers are comparable to Five Guys, but here you get more choices of flavors - like teriyaki or hawaiian. I love pineapples in burgers, and this place had it. :) They also have a decent malt shake here. 

Place is clleeaaaaan."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time, and my family and I really enjoyed our food. The employees were super friendly, and it had a very nice vibe for eating inside. 

I had the Santa Barbara Char (Double Char with Cheese & Avocado on Grilled Sourdough), and the burger was good with the avocado and cheese, and the bread perfectly cooked.  Husband had the Chicken club (marinated chicken breast, lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, avocado, and mayo, on toasted sourdough) and said it was one of the best he has had.  Son had BBQ Bacon charburger with an extra patty (lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, pickles, and mayo on a toasted bun), and inhaled it.  We also shared an order of fries and onion rings.  Both delicious, and not greasy.  We liked the coating and flavor of the onions in the onion rings, and the fries had a good potato flavor. The ranch sauce for the onion rings was really good, too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times. Each time the cashier was very nice. The food was cooked fresh and everything tasted pretty good. I have never been there when they were super busy so it was fast and convenient for me. Prices were more than fair. I'd give it a try. It's a nice addition to In & Out and Five Guys. Plus, they have onion rings."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the customer service given to us by the manager working was enough to make my co-workers and I no longer go there. We asked for 6 ranches to which he threw a fit that we would even ask for that many I offered twice to pay for them. That wasn't an issue for me, he wouldn't let me pay for them but as he handed them to me with an attitude I was told \"just seems ridiculous to ask for 6 for 2 salads\" Side note, they just weren't for the 2 salads I was getting some for other co-workers who needed it for theirs who paid on a seperate bill. Why work in customer service if you're going to through a fit over some ranch? NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I hate that I'm writing this but this was such  bad experience I feel it needs to be shared.

I had gotten off work and decided I wanted a salad. I love The Habits food, especially their salads. So I went in, ordered a Chicken Caesar Salad. Simple enough. She asked me if I wanted everything on it, I said yes. It took a little long in my opinion but nothing outrageous. The guy buzzed my buzzer, grabbed my bag and left. 

Got home, opened my salad. No dressing...zero. Its usually mixed in the salad by them. I figured, maybe they put it on the side, fine. Nope, no dressing at all in the entire bag. Checked my fridge, we don't even have dressing to put on it!! So I have dry lettuce, chicken, and croutons. So disappointed.

I decide to call the store to ask for a refund. But no, you can't call a specific Habit, they have a call center. The call center said that they couldn't issue refunds. They said I needed to fill out an online request form if I wanted anything. So I did. I filled out this entire form. Went to submit it....the website is filled with errors. It wouldn't let me submit the form because I hadn't filled out the stores street address, which would have been away to fix, except for the fact that I did write it in the box, retried several times with no luck. 

Called the call center back, the guy took my number down and said management would call me tomorrow before noon.

No salad dressing...no money...no dinner

Thanks Habit!!"}
{"text":"This place serves a solid fast food burger.  I love the variety and freshness of it all.  They have malts!  Even better!  

I stick with the char burger with cheese.  One time I've tried the steak sandwich and the first one was so rare I had to return it and the second one I got had so much tendon in it i couldn't bite off pieces.  

The fries, onion rings, tempura green beans are all delicious.  They also have awesome ranch!  

Great place to grab a quick bite!"}
{"text":"The hype didn't live up to my expectations... but I figured this place out.  If you want the quality of a fast food burger and fries but want a nice place to eat at... you go to the Habit.  

The build-out of the restaurant is great, looks like a Chipotle, but the burger looks and taste like Burger King.  

I got the Charburger, onion rings and a drink for $7.17 w/ tax which seems a bit much for an average burger.  However, the customer services was great, the manager even came over to say hello.  I'm not coming back unless someone wants to buy me lunch."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! The burgers are made fresh to order and their sweet potatoes fries are delicious.

Employees are very friendly and helpful. We have always received excellent customer service. Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to squawk about, but certainly a nice place. Didn't do anything wrong but also wasn't amazing. Normally I don't like charbroiled, reminds me of BK, but this was good. Meat is not that thick so if you prefer meat over topping get the double not the single. Side fries is plentiful but are squishy and not that crunchy. Very fast cooking. Counter ordering and self seating, reminds me of smash, five, etc. style restaurants."}
{"text":"Customer service always great. They truly make an effort that every customer is satisfied. While I was waiting for my to go order I noticed an employee walk around the lobby asking customers how the food was. She even refilled drinks for the children. Great great great customer service!"}
{"text":"Most cheap, fast-food burgers are glorified slop. 
Most sit-down \"fancy\" burgers are terribly over-priced. 
Wouldn't it be great to get a GREAT burger AND a GREAT price!?

Habit.

This place never disappoints. The burgers are fresh, flavorful and made to order in an open kitchen.. The fries are cooked to a perfect crisp. The interior of the restaurant is neat, clean and welcoming. The staff is friendly. There are even menu items that cater to the non-carnivores out there.

All-in-all, it's great burger, a very reasonable price, and a super way to spend your lunch hour."}
{"text":"Love this place! 7th time here in 2 months. Killer menu, great prices, GREAT friendly helpful staff. Wish we had one of these places in Philly or SE PA.  What a nice relaxing place with excellent tasting salads, burgers, even shakes. And these natural trash & juices are super! Congrats to management for a well-rounded happy place!!"}
{"text":"You can't complain about the quick service here. The line was out the door and everyone was served so quickly we had to do a double take. Ordered basic stuff since we were just checking it out. It was good but not amazing. Somehow I just expected more. The meat was ok, the fries were pretty basic. 
 Would I go out of my way to come here? No. Would I go again if someone wanted me to go, yes.
 So service is great, food is ok to good , but are there better options?! Yes."}
{"text":"Love their Portabello Char..I come here a lot but I'm basing this review from my last visit. I always order from the drive-thru and they messed it up twice the same day, the burgers fell out of the wrapper right after taking it out of the bag. I was sooo bummed! Poor burger."}
{"text":"My mother recommended we go here for lunch one day... and I was pretty annoyed that we passed an In-N-Out to get here.

We walked in and the place was busy! The line moved fast and the service was extremely friendly. I couldn't believe the great prices and the side options. I went for the Mushroom Swiss Char and the Onion Rings with in-house made Ranch Dressing. 

As soon as I sank my teeth into that burger I instantly forgot about In-N-Out. Great flavor, and the mushrooms were overflowing out the sides! YUM! The Onion Rings came out super-hot and were fresh and crunchy. The ranch dressing was pretty tasty too! 

Next time I really want to try the Tempura Green Beans. Glad we have a great new burger place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has become my habit and I haven't even tried the burger yet... I'm so in love with barbecue chicken salad, the cobb salad and seared ahi tuna sandwich it is all amazing!  I can't wait to try the burger!!! Oh and I also have to mention the delicious lightly tempura green beans are so yummy! Everytime I go there the people are friendly, they're efficient it's very clean I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Today was the second time I have had their food, but the first time I dined in. 

We had burgers--double cheeseburger for me and bacon cheese burger for my stepson. They should be better. They are charcoal grilled from what I understand, but I can't taste it. The meat tastes pretty much like a standard fast-food burger. Not bad, mind you, but not great. That said, their fries and onion rings were good. Next time I want to try the tri-tip sandwich and others in my house want to try the albacore tuna. Others have raved about those. 

Of course, this is a fast food place (but it is not fast, everything is made to order), so the decor reflects that. No points off for that since it is exactly what you would expect. Service was good. 

In all, a decent place and a good addition to the neighborhood. Maybe I can bump it up a star after I try the tri-tip."}
{"text":"Great Hatch Green Chili Burger tonight. Tempura Green beans are the Best!!
Great place !!!"}
{"text":"The food here never disappoints, it's always fresh and delicious! It's a little slice of home since they had this restaurant back in California. The best onion rings with the ranch, omg, you'll be back again, you cant just eat here once! A must for true burger connoisseur! Yumm!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great staff, clean, inviting, great food truly a good burger. We will continue to go again and again."}
{"text":"SANTA BAR CHAR protein style was delish!!
Just ordered the meat to stay a little healthy but had to eat some of my grandkids french fries and those were pretty delicious.. lol"}
{"text":"So this place is getting so much hype for a franchise and it's not that great. It's good but not roll your eyes back good. The burger meat is good and cooked well and taste good but it doesn't stand out from other burgers I've had. They use mayo as their spread and that's fine just I had to add ketchup cause I'm used to thousand island. Fries were good taste like some Burger King fries. Overall this place is just ok I just think for that price I'm expecting more. I love how they make your food to order so I know it's fresh."}
{"text":"The service was surprisingly good for a burger joint. The order taker and managers were nice and helpful.  The burger was very good, I got the double hamburger, no cheese. I tried a shake (good) and the green beans (they were decent).  The decor was nice and the place was slammed. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Love this place!! This is one of my favorite places to go to splurge! I love the juicy, tender, perfectly cooked burger. My order is a original char burger with bacon and pickles and cheese only and I highly recommend it. They are very nice too. If u tell them something, they will respond with a positive attitude. However, my sister ordered the veggie burger once and did not enjoy it as much as me. She also ordered fries and did not get them and they kindly replaced both. Over all, delicious."}
{"text":"ASIA ASIA ASIA ! ThAts all you need to know ! She is absolutely AMAZING !! The food was good but the experience she gave us and the patience she had with me and my BF was great. It was our first visit and me and him are soo difficult but she was great and definitely help us so much !"}
{"text":"If you have not had the teriyaki  char burger... You are failing at life."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago. 
The lemonade and sweet potato fries were my favorite part. The burger and patty melt were just ok. Not bad. Not good. Just ok. I've had better, in my opinion not worth the $27 we paid !"}
{"text":"Just a over priced in and out burger with a different name. And the fries tasted like they pulled them out of the ground and right into the deep frier. To over priced. Just another rip you off with bad food burger place."}
{"text":"Pretty solid burgers here, all the ingredients are fresh. The service is great and the place is modern and very clean. Tempura green beans are pretty good, onion rings are pretty standard. Their fries are always hot and crispy, well seasoned. The burgers are juicy and presented well, I would say this place is a nicer In N Out, more flavorful burgers in my opinion. Their shakes are good, nothing too crazy though standard flavors. Overall pretty good burger joint. 4.25/5"}
{"text":"This review is based off the service not the food. Tried it for the first time in Las Vegas and was very pleased. Came to the Gilbert location expecting the same and it fell short. They forgot part of my order, I called and no option to speak to anybody directly. Came back to get the missing order and the the opportunity to regain a 5 in service was missed. Go for the food but not the service."}
{"text":"I received a free Char burger with cheese coupon for my birthday by email and my husband and I went as a quick lunch that day around 11:00 am.
We were treated very well by Ealyse and enjoyed our food very much. In particular we found the french fries very tasty, light and crispy but without too much salt. I would like to thank the manager and staff at this location, the food was prepared and cooked well and the taste was delicious! 5 stars in my book! :)"}
{"text":"Good burgers! I ordered the double Charburger with a side of French fries. The French fries are tasty and golden brown. The burger is like that picture-perfect image that Burger King advertises except it's real. Price is reasonable. Looking forward to trying the other burgers this place has to offer!"}
{"text":"I go shop around this area.... every time iv all around this place seem to be calling me like\" jennnnnniiiifer commmme eat heeeeere. And it's like I'm getting hypnotized. Yayyyy. Funny coz I don't eat meat anymore BUT! Guess what ? They have this awesome veggie burger that taste like meat I get a bit of add ons there like teriyaki sauce and pineapple and whoa!!!! Nom nom nom. Dang this food is so dankkkk. I go here if I'm feeling burgeree. After my chomping of this great chow I burn maybe 50 calories of it by walking it off back in the same area or across the street. Yes only 50 cal. Because I had to order me some sweet potato fries with it and soda too you know. Okay enough said. Lez eat!"}
{"text":"I ordered this one day at work and am not sorry I did. The Santa Barbara burger is AMAZING! The price isn't bad for yow much food you get. It definitely fills you up. There fries are ok (not really worth it) but there onion rings are excellent"}
{"text":"Honestly the very first time I have been to The Habit wasn't the best! They had me feeling like their burgers were just okay, that you couldn't really mess up a burger type of feeling.  I really didn't think of going to Habit again until my co-worker suggested it.  Long behold maybe 2-3yrs later, we go and this time it was a very tasty burger!! The thing that changed my outlook on this restaurant was the toasted bun.  I believe that the bun itself made this burger stand out.  I got the charred burger with double patties and cheese, which made me feel like I was at a BBQ. 

I must say that I can see myself going here more often after my second experience.  Was a very satisfying cheese burger"}
{"text":"One of my wife's friend's suggested we try this place.  Last night we finally tried it.  Let me put it this way...  I've been a loyal customer at the nearby In N Out burger place.  My future burger business will now be 100% at The Habit Burger Grill.  They beat In N Out it quality, menu selection, taste and are comparable in price.

I ordered the hamburger with 2 patties with everything on it, cheese included.  First, the patties are much bigger than the In N Out patties.  The whole burger itself is bigger and tastes better.

My wife got the grilled chicken sandwich with bbq sauce.  She said it was a little too salty, but I'm sure we can make a simple request and have that issue fixed the next time.

I got the onion rings, something I prefer over fries that In N Out doesn't even offer.  The onion rings were crispy and great with ketchup.

And if you're wondering, the Habit Burger Grill easily beats Smashburger also.  But I've never been a fan of Smashburger and think they're way over priced.

I wish they would offer a frequent customer program, something like order 10 burgers and get the 11th free."}
{"text":"Absolutely average. Not bad, just bland. Add some pepper or sea salt to the patties. Fries were fresh and good. The #1 is what I had, the food was fresh tasting but that's it. No flavor. I had a lot of hope going in but will not be returning. The price was decent as well. Just flavorless."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my colleague and the food was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!  I had the fried chicken burger, OMG!  The sauce was EXCELLENT, the other condiments were fresh. Good sweet potatoe fries.  GOOD EATS!  The customer service was great as well.  The store was clean, bright and good music.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time and #Victor at the register was very helpful. It really shows that he has a passion for his job. Hopefully the food is as good as the service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So the day started off with us wanting breakfast/brunch for Mothers Day, however most brunch places was an hour wait and we were hungry!

My hubby saw this place from across the way and decided to try it out. Now I figure eh ok another burger joint. 

We ordered the tri tip burger, gold fried chicken sandwich and the char burger. Sides we had french fries and onion rings. 

Tri-tip apparently is the best steak sandwich my husbands ever had. It's kinda chewy, if you ask me. 

My kid loved his chicken sandwich he said it was very juicy and tender, I had a little piece and it was really good. 

I thought my char burger was good. The fries were ok but the onions rings were perfect. I think I'm going to try a different burger next time. 

Overall this place is a good sit down burger joint."}
{"text":"Got the double with cheese. Thought it tasted familiar but couldn't put a name to it. I put some of the ketchup I got for my fries on it and the light came on.          
The Micky D from the distant past. Yup, like that! I'll stick with Shake Shack thanks. We stopped at the Habit in St. George and it was 4 star. This one was seriously lacking in the char department. More like steamed?"}
{"text":"My wife and I could not decide what to eat when we came upon this new restaurant while out and about.  From the curb looks appealing, but there is much to be desired.  When we walked inside it was mildly busy with about 14 staff behind the counter. We were greeted and told our order could be taken, after deciding our order, we were told to wait while the cashier wiped down her area and restocked her supplies.  My wife ordered, and the cashier told me my total without asking my order, half out of spite I paid for my wife's order without ordering myself as I didn't feel I wanted to spend any more money with this establishment at this point.  We were given a pager, told it would go off when our order was ready.  We sat, and waited...  About 12 minutes went by until our pager went off for our order of one burger and onion rings.  Again with about 14 cooking staff behind the counter.  The burger was fresh, but the pineapple slice on our burger was warm, but not cooked, making the burger tough to eat.  The cherry limeaid also tasted of the used rag that wipes down the counter at the end of the night.  I had higher hopes for this new establishment, and hope they can improve if they want my business in the future.  Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"I agree with the preview comments about a four star it's more than a three star but not better than Freddy's 
I loved the onion rings the portions were a bit small but overall good . The service was great! Five star always"}
{"text":"Really nice location. Drive thru can be a little confusing and you might have to park a little ways but it's worth it. Clean and wasn't busy. Went here after a race. Took about 10 minutes for order but all burgers are made when ordered which is a big plus to me. I would compare it to price of In n out but these burgers are thicker and too me taste better. Ordered the double char with cheese meal. Only thing I wish I added were some sauces. Burger was fresh and not overly seasoned which I loved. Fries were ok wish it had more flavor. Plenty of seating for dining in and the bathrooms were extremely clean. They have a baby changer in women's restroom"}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers.  Me and the hubs each got a charburger with cheese and fries.  Service was also fast and food was out promptly.  They seem to cook on demand, not having food sit under a heat lamp.  This location does get busy around lunch time as it's in a busy business area, near the strip, and also near the university.

Good, quick food.  Will probably try again."}
{"text":"Update:  My family and I have been back several times including via drive-thru.  This is our new fav spot.  Food is great and not expensive.

My only complaint is that the Drive-thru often takes a long long time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit here. The burgers are flame-broiled ala Burger King. No, this is NOT a gourmet burger, but a basic one done right. The decor is modern and trendy with big comfy booths. Service is a little slow, but that's the price of freshness. I will be back again and again. This place kills McDonalds and BK!"}
{"text":"Price was not to shabby you do pay for what you get though fresh ingredients I had the char burger with cheese and it was delicious and not greasy at all. My wife had the grilled chicken sandwich with a wheat bun the bun and the chicken tasted amazing and even better the chicken was not dry, great service our food was out quick and the place is a home feeling place, the tile on the floor is like the tile you would find in a house and subway tiles on the wall. There bathrooms were clean as well which is also a plus. I would definitely go here again"}
{"text":"No bullshit here. Delicious burgers and good service. Classic rock. It's a good low key spot."}
{"text":"This was our first visit in our new hometown.  Appeared to be clean and we could see the burgers being prepared right in front of us.  It took the staff more than five minutes to even acknowledge us.  As I contemplated leaving, we were met with: \"What can I do for you?\" Hmmmm... I thought, I'm sorry that we're hungry.  Despite the less than stellar first impression, hungry won out and we ordered.  I prayed that we wouldn't be disappointed.  Dad & I got the Jalapeno Char-burger Special ($4.99).  It was pretty darn good!  I recommend either the onion rings or the sweet potato fries- YUM!  Kids meals looked to be good because my son ate all the chicken nuggets, applesauce, and gummy burger for dessert.  My daughter had a regular charburger and liked it.  VERY relieved that the food rocked!  Hopefully the service will be better next time because I rate this place higher than Sm*$£But&÷R!!!"}
{"text":"Online ordered for sweet potato fries. Says ready in 10 minutes. Show up on time and it still took them 15 minutes to prepare. 25 minutes for sweet potato fries! Idiots. Do not go here ever. 0.0 stars"}
{"text":"I was expecting more here, nothing really to write home about much better burgers elsewhere e.g. Zinburger."}
{"text":"So I had to try this new burger joint out twice before deciding whether I liked it or not... and it's alright.  The \"central call center\" your call gets routed to instead of the actual business could use some training when placing a to-go order.  The people at the joint are really nice and attentive, but the taste of the burger and fries aren't quite worth the price tag of $10.  Was hoping their Teri Charburger with the grilled pineapple was similar to the \"Banzai burger\" at... or their Double Charburger was similar to the \"Double Double\" at... but sadly no.  However, their alternative beverages like strawberry limeade, if soda isn't your thing, is actually quite tasty.  When the fam and I are wanting to satisfy our  cravings, we'll most likely go to our first and second choices before considering this burger place unfortunately.  

WERD..."}
{"text":"I am not a big fast food guy but heard this burger was rated extremely high.  I still would rather have a bar burger.  To me it is just like any other fast food place that you would go to.  I will say the servers were extremely friendly and the ambiance was good for fast food.  It was worth the try but it did not wow me."}
{"text":"Have been eaten at The Habit in Santa Barbara for a decade.  So glad they have opened up here in Las Vegas.  I love this place."}
{"text":"I was sad to see Baja Fresh leave this space, but having a Habit Grill instead def. cushions the blow!

I hadn't been to a Habit before, and I was impressed. I'm on a healthy kick, so i ordered their veggie burger and a caesar side salad. The veggie burger was good - it was admittedly a pretty standard veggie patty, but the whole wheat bun was good, and there were enough other items on the burger to make it feel substantial - pickles, cucumber slices, tomatoes, and onions. (I had hoped it would be a thicker made-in-house patty, but no such luck. Ah well.) The salad was fine - it felt like the right amount for a $2.25 side salad.

All in all, i'm sure this will be a new stop in the lunch rotation. Also, extra bonus points for having A-1 sauce out for use. More places should do the same!

(only negative for me is that they seemed to have decreased the inside seating with the build-out for this place.... so if it's not patio weather outside, you may want to re-think coming here during the heavy lunch rush.)"}
{"text":"Best fast food chicken hands down! Plus if you want, avocado on everything which is always a bonus in my book."}
{"text":"Ok so the kids and I consider ourselves burger aficionados. This place is definitely going to be a #HABIT for us! Love the open kitchen. The patties were perfectly seasoned. Great burgers!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time I had the Habit, and I will say that the burger was great, I tried the Santa Barbara burger, it was on a buttery sourdough bread with two burger patties, American cheese, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, grilled onions, mayo, avocados. All were great and I do love that they have a pepper bar. That being said the fries were ok at best, my friend got the sweet potato fries and that's definitely the way to go. All in all I will definitely back"}
{"text":"I've never had a burger here, I strictly come for their grilled chicken salad. I usually come to this location because it's close to work, but I've never had an issue with their chicken salads at any location. It's always busy at lunch time, but their salads are worth the wait! Their veggies are always crisp, chicken always hot and fresh and it's a good portion for the price. It's important that salads mainly consist of mixed greens (which is what they serve) instead of iceberg lettuce, otherwise, where's the nutrition in that?? They seem to have healthy choices in mind for patrons who are looking for a lighter fare. I also love the plentiful pepper bar! I've tried their sweet potato fries and shakes too which are also delicious. 

The manager here is awesome! He is always smiling and attentive to his customers as well as his staff. It really looks like the employees have a good time while they're working. They had a glitch with their register once and one of the cashiers brought over my food where I was sitting, she was really sweet! 

Overall, this place is great! I'll continue being a regular customer as long as I'm around the area :)"}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying new burger places and we made our way to The Habit on Memorial Day. I got the BBQ Bacon Charburger (with pickle only) and fries. The burger was pretty good & well seasoned. Could've used some more BBQ sauce. The fries were your average frozen French fries. Probably should've tried the onion rings. They appear to have a tempura batter like the green bean fries, which also looked good."}
{"text":"My friend had a free birthday burger and it was the last day so he made it a point to use it. When they scanned the code, it came up as expired. They should have still honored it. Not cool, Habit Burger! Also, this was at least the 2nd time my cup leaked at the seam."}
{"text":"Hamburgers are... just ok. I love Hamburgers, but these are paper thin. 

For the price point- I would rather go to Five Guys.

For my real burger fix: I prefer Zin burger."}
{"text":"The burger tasted like something you would get at Burger King and the Salad was mostly lettuce and not even fresh lettuce the ready pac preshredded lettuce that has that weird after taste. Would not go back or recommend to anyone ."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Charburger with cheese, crisp lettuce, fresh tomato, caramelized onions, and pickles on a toasted bun

Launched in Santa Barbara California in 1969 by two brothers, and since having spread to more than ten States with four locations dotting Las Vegas beginning in 2016, The Habit Burger Grill had been a source of some curiosity ever since opening down the street and some calling it the best burger under $5 in the city, Consumer Reports also awarding them the title of \"Best Tasting Burger in America\" back in 2014.

Slightly different from the hundreds of locations up and down California, the local Habits all franchise operations while those in California are considered 'corporate' entities, it was mid-day on Friday that a stop was made at the Blue Diamond location where the line was just two persons long, a man easily identifiable as the General Manager teaching employees how to work one of the register functions immediately greeting all guests with a big smile, the menu pretty self-explanatory with Burgers, Sandwiches, Salads, Shakes and Sides.

Using a vibrating pager system to summon diners, a similar situation to that at Shake Shack given the fact that each item is made to order, it was in passing on the Tri-Tip that is offered 'medium, medium-well, or well' that an order of two Sandwiches plus a side and Shake took place, the Charburger with Cheese complimentary and taken without Mayo as a result of signing up for their free online \"Char-club.\"

Featuring a clean design and condiment station with all the expected, plus several styles of Peppers, a quick look at Beverages also shows Habit to offer their own housemade Lemonade alongside Coca-Cola products, a quick Buzz from the little square summoning diners back to the counter where a weighty tray contained everything presented nicely, a bit of paper left on the Straw and each Sandwich half-wrapped and Insta-gram worthy.

Starting with the Onion Rings, a relatively simple item for even a fast-food kitchen to execute well, The Habit improves on most by cutting their Rings uniform before dredging  them in Buttermilk and frying each one crisp, a total lack of oil making each one crunchy and flavorful, much like the well-seasoned Chicken Breast that is spiced, seasoned and breaded on site before being placed on a grilled bun with California-fresh Produce and a couple Pickle Rounds, the recommended Red Pepper Sauce a worthy addition to a Sandwich that not only outsizes and tastes better than that at Chick-Fil-a, but also makes the version at Shake Shack seem somewhat boring.

Moving on to the Charburger, only the second \"fast-food\" or \"quick-casual\" option tasted in almost a decade, those expecting a Restaurant quality Burger are likely to be a little disappointed by the thin patty that none-the-less contains a lot of flavor and good grind for just $3.25 and an extra sixty cents for a slice of Cheddar, the Caramelized Onions definitely adding a lot of 'oomph' without making the Sandwich too messy while the Milkshake served next to it unfortunately did little to be impressive, the 'Coffee' flavor substantially muted by that of Chocolate though the base was homogenous and quite creamy.

THREE AND A HALF STARS:  Good for what it is, and far better than most of what Panera or Chipotle is serving at a price that is far less, The Habit Burger Grill certainly takes a major step in upgrading the sort of stuff served at Burger King, McDonalds or Wendy's though the relatively small menu may leave those looking for more variety or bargain-basement dining unimpressed."}
{"text":"Thought I would try Habit burger since I was staying down the street. Heard it was a very popular West Coast burger chain. Very friendly service! Decided to try a a double char w cheese combo! They let u split the side: fries and onion rings. The onion rings stole the show. They were crispy, non greasy and the perfect bread to onion ratio! The fries were ok, I prefer a little crispier. The burger was pretty good! Definitely get the side of ranch that comes with it!"}
{"text":"I was really pleased when I was able to place an order just a few minutes before closing.  Better yet, the char burger with cheese was good, I loved the toasted bun and the fries had just the right amount of crispiness."}
{"text":"Located off McDowell, in Avondale, next to Cafe Zumas, with lots of parking. 
Restaurant is clean and staff are friendly and welcoming.  The only thing going against the restaurant is it's on the small side (-1).  If you're a large family, and come on a popular evening, expect most of the seats to be taken.  There is outdoor seating as well, and those were sadly occupied too.  The area to line up, order, and pay is also small too (-1) which I can envision, on popular evenings and days, can become a problem.  There were 3 cashiers taking orders and they were moving fast as it was so the line was moving somewhat fast.
The menu was easily comprehensible.
Food ordered -- the Double Char with cheese and everything, regular side of fries, and a shake were all phenomenal.  The fries were fresh and soft, not soggy or crispy or oily.  The burger was fresh and tasted like it just came off the grill.  The shake was good - not too rich and creamy. 
Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Caesar salad with tri-tip. So much gristle, I sent back the 1st one. Same results with the 2nd salad. If they give you s plastic fork & knife you should be able to cut your meat"}
{"text":"Habit lives up to the hype!  Burger was made perfect and tasted great.  Very impressed.  Decor was a bit Burger King ordinary, but whatever, it was fast and delicious."}
{"text":"It was good. But with so many burger options in the area I wouldn't say this would be my first choice. Prices comparable to in and out burger. I think in and out is hard to top. Service and staff were friendly. 3 stars is comparing it to in and out sorry they got you beat."}
{"text":"WOW OMG HEAVEN so I am a burger fan and love in & out but the habit has them beat hands down. I personally love a chargrilled burger better than fried and the habit burgers are big juicy chargrilled goodness"}
{"text":"I love their burgers. They're cooked to order and served up piping hot. Their fries are always crisp. For me, nothing beats ketchup with a few splashes of hot sauce & Habit always has Cholula & Tabasco near their condiment station. 

There's obviously an emphasis on service with a smile at every Habit I've visited and any dining experience is better when you feel genuinely welcome and you feel the staff are doing their best to earn your repeat business.

Not nearly as busy as the 7th & Glendale location and perhaps this location is not very well known or overshadowed by several competitors close by."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! It is like a combination of in n out and five guys. The burgers and fries are better than in n out but it is cheaper than five guys!! This my absolute favorite place to get onion rings, they are crispy and the ranch is excellent with them!"}
{"text":"The double char sandwich was a great size, i couldn't  finish it! Will definitely go back for that and the fries, but the hamburgers on the other hand are a tad bit too small. But over all the taste of everything was amazing. Definitly recommended"}
{"text":"Los Angeles style burgers.  I've gone twice, and both times gotten exactly what I want when I go out for a burger.

The burgers are great, the fries are perfect, and they have those little chili peppers.  I grab a bunch of those, and mix my ketchup with Tapatio 50/50."}
{"text":"May 28 was National Hamburger Day and The Habit gave away free burgers.  I had never been here before and a free burger was enough to draw me in.  They were giving away \"Charburgers\" which are their signature burgers.  This wasn't any ordinary fast food burger.  It was topped with cheese, lettuce, pickles, onions, tomato and mayo.  It was very delicious and just the right size. I took a peak at the menu and saw some unique menu items.  There is a teriyaki and pineapple burger that sounded interesting. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Solid performance time after time.  This time I visited with a free charburger coupon for my birthday.  The cashier was super friendly, accurate, and wished me a happy birthday twice (once as I was leaving after dining in). My lettuce wrapped double char burger with cheese and grilled onions, no mayo, was perfect drippy goodness.  The lettuce wraps was generous enough the sandwich did not fall apart.  The meat was juicy and the temperature was perfect. Nice job and quick, too!"}
{"text":"I've had this place on my list for a while. I'm not a fan of coming to this decaying mall area of town or anything around it so I waited to come until I had a reason. Now that I've been to The Habit I'm neither impressed nor disappointed, just meh.

I'm not sure what they're trying to be. Certainly not take-out fast food. Certainly not cheap eats. The closest I can guess is that they see a niche to compete with places like Five Guys or Fatburger.

We paid an average of about 10 bucks each for a relatively basic combo, which includes an average size order of fries and an average size medium drink. The counter person was about average, coming across a little befuddled. Exactly as another reviewer reported 2 months earlier. I ordered a #1 Combo and she asked me if I wanted fries and a drink with it. I mean how hard is it to train a cashier what the meaning of a combo is?

The restaurant size is about average, with sit-down tables only, no counter seating. The décor and ambience are average bland chain restaurant colors and design.

The burger itself has an average-size meat patty that looks and tastes pretty average. There is a lot of shredded lettuce on it to give the appearance of being larger than it is. They prepare it an average way with lettuce, pickle and grilled onions unless you specify otherwise. Cheese is extra and it must be well hidden on the menu board because I could not easily find what the upcharge is to add it (and they don't itemize the extra charge on your receipt).

About that shredded lettuce, though, for me it sort of ruined my first experience eating a Habit burger. Not only was there way too much of it but it was wilted and soggy and gave my sandwich an off taste. In fact I could hardly taste anything else. That single factor is responsible for reducing what would have been a more favorable review down to 3-stars.

Two other things worked against my first visit to this place. One, while the staff was generally pleasant there were just too many of them wandering around, I counted six of them clustered around the service counter with no customers in sight. It looked to me like two or more managers were training other staffers on the floor while customers tried to dine. It was weird and awkward and obviously ineffective since they still ask if you would like fries and a drink with your combo. Makes me wonder if the managers know what a combo is.

Second, I couldn't help but notice that several ceiling tiles looked like they were ready to fall on customers' heads. I mean they were just dangling in place. The restaurant hasn't been there that long to be in such bad shape and the negative impression it made on me as a customer was if they were that careless and sloppy with something so obvious how careful were they being with such things as keeping their food prep equipment sanitary? I was actually glad to leave for fear of the entire ceiling falling on my head."}
{"text":"Ok finally got try your burger and it's a cut above the rest including the overrated in and out burger and shake shack,broiled is the key and a bigger beef patty then most places and the tempura green beans are fantastic the batter actually stays on the beans too.i also had the vanilla malt it was great and they offer whipped cream topping. There are a good variety of burger choices also I'll be a regular for sure, and the staff are very friendly and neat appearance I also met the district manager and he is on top of it and manages the place by being everywhere at once a must try for sure. And the price are fair too!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger I've had. I also loved their sweet potato fries! My new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Lunch time so the line was long but moved quickly.  Had the single char with cheese and onion rings hubby had the Santa Barbara. The flavor of the meat was excellent on both our bugers. Toppings were very fresh.  Love love love charbroiled burgers! Onion rings were very good also. Good ranch dressing for dipping too. Like the flavor way better than Smashburger and In N Out. Also good ice tea, not that Gold Peak crap but real brewed tea. ( I am weird about tea I know).  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just came here w my husband. Great service. He had the double char and I had the Santa Barbara. We shared the green beans and onion rings. I also had a strawberry malt. We both enjoyed the burgers and the onion rings were probably the best I've ever had. Not too big or greasy. The green beans were kinda meh. Good texture but not much flavor. The malt was ok. Not much malt in it. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent 100% beef burger at a great price. Best burger that you can drive through and pick up in Las Vegas. They have incredibly fresh food and I love the salads. they have everykind and are huge. Char burger, avocado, bacon, mushrooms, badda bing badda boom. Tempura Green beans, oooweee!"}
{"text":"Tastes great. Chicken portion could have been bigger for the price. Fries were barely room temperature.  And the lettuce was too wet. Coming in at 8 pm shouldn't have made a difference."}
{"text":"My husband gave this a 4 star and has been back to confirm his choice.  Fries were lousy, but the double he loved, and the onion rings.  I would have given it a 3.  I had the burger on bread with mushrooms and avocado.  Tasted okay but didn't feel so great afterwards.  It is good for fast food.  I think most fast food burgers are a 1!"}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers with even better prices.
Can't go wrong with fresh fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"this spot owns and the nice ladies who run the joint are ON POINT: it's spotless (even during peak lunch hours), the condiment bar is always fully-stocked (fresh lemons for my Diet Coke? yes please!), and the food is *insanely* delicious. (i usually go with the Santa Barbara burger with sweet potato fries, and my gf gets the grilled BBQ chicken sandwich and tempura green beans.) 

Habit is cheap, cheerful, and my new favorite lunch spot in Vegas. highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is our first time coming to this location and they ruined our order. We ordered 2 bbq bacon char burgers and when we got home we opened the bag to find that they gave us 2 teriyaki char burgers without buns. Also, when you ask for ranch the little cups are filled less than 1/4 of the way. When we called them they wouldn't let us talk to the manager. They told us to come all the way back. We live in the Centennial Hills area, so that was definitely a NO. So disappointing. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Okay, so I went here with my buddy Jordan when he was in town from Dallas. I've never went there before but seeing a lot of pictures. It always looks so good and he happened to be staying in the area of the burger joint. One of the best burgers I've ever had and the service was impeccable as well. We sat at the bar so Props to the bartender for being on your game. I recommend you go here , but be prepared to look for parking for a while. At least that was my case."}
{"text":"Tried this place recently and wasn't too impressed.  It's located in a busy shopping center which includes a Walmart and other retailers. Was excited to try it, but it was just so-so.  I had a regular char burger and a side of onion rings.  My first bite of the onion rings were somewhat \"bitter\" in taste.  They came with a nice  garlicky ranch dip which was the only thing that made them somewhat more interesting.  You don't get a lot of onion rings for $2.40 (way overpriced for the amount)

The burger only had a very mild char flavor. I was really expecting a lot more flavor in the meat itself, which was lacking and didn't seem any better than most fast food burgers.  Honestly, and I'm sure this will sound like heresy, but I'd rather go to  my local McDonald's or a Carl's Jr. than drive over to Habit Burger.  I doubt I'll go here again unless there's a special reason that makes me feel it's justified.  The restaurant itself seems nice and clean.  It just didn't live up to the \"hype\" as often happens with so many of the burgers today."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom while I was visiting.  Great food at a great price!  I'll definitely go again next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fantastic, over the top, service recieved at this location. And yummy food too! We will be back. Kuddo's"}
{"text":"Must have forgotten to review this place. I went here a couple months ago for lunch and got a burger, fries and a malt. All of it was really good. The portions are pretty large and everything tasted fresh and was prepared well. Definitely give this place a shot if you want a good burger without having to pay a fortune for it."}
{"text":"So we meant to go in yesterday and try The Habit for the first time, but on the way there something cumbersome happened... the baby fell asleep in the car. And one thing we've learned about parenthood is... you NEVER, under any circumstances, wake a soundly sleeping baby. So we wound up taking it to go and eating it in the car, LOL. 

The restaurant seemed nicer and cleaner than your average fast food burger joint. Our order was ready quickly and the service was good. The prices... well as a previous reviewer stated, their 2 combos aren't a deal from ordering a la carte. So get whatever darn fry, drink or anything else you want, because you're going to pay the same price for your upgrades whether you get them with your combo or order them separately. That said, overall it seemed cheaper than, let's say, a burger at Five Guys. 

My husband enjoyed his burger and I liked my chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce. Both the regular fries (nothing special, but good) and the sweet potato fries, were decent. The chocolate shake so hit the spot! 

If this were closer to home and I was in the mood for a burger, I might consider it more. Good stuff."}
{"text":"The burgers are alright - patties do not look fresh, but the toping make up for it. Fries are great. The meal deal will leave you stuffed. Pleasantly surprised to see all female staff."}
{"text":"Is great but when I saw how skimpy they are with the fries kinda turned me off.... California Habits were not like this but out here it felt like ordering a kids meal... smh"}
{"text":"3+ Stars.  I ordered their cheeseburger meal, not a bad price.  The burger I thought was a little small and messy, I think it was the shredded lettuce. The fries were good, 3 types of tea to include regular tea for those who do not care for flavored teas. Limited seating inside and lots outside which is great for those wonderful weather days. A little too noisy inside like the conversations were bouncing off walls.  Ambience overall OK, food OK, nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Takin a lunch break! Fantastic food and great friendly service. I had a Santa Barbara Style Char burger and added bacon. Such great flavor. I had a side of sweet potato fries which were done perfectly"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review. I'm not one usually to talk about the customer service I received whether good or bad but today I have to! I came to Habit for lunch but stopped first next door at Starbucks for a tea. While waiting for our food I dropped my full cup of tea not once but twice, spilling my tea everywhere. Two workers came over to clean it up but not only did they clean it up, one (Will G) actually went next door to Starbucks to get me another drink and paid for it! Talk about awesome customer service!! So, hats off to them and their team! Will, thank you...Well done, you have a customer for life! I will be coming here every time I'm at this office!!"}
{"text":"A great chargrilled cheeseburger, made to order. You can choose the wheat bun if you'd like. They have great sweet potato fries, cooked just right. I have had their veggie burger before, which was good.  Quite a few salads to choose from. Several iced teas to choose from. 

Employees are always friendly and seem genuine. 
Kids like their kids meals, especially the gummy cheeseburger, which makes this place unique. 

They also have some tasty desserts (frozen treats) too if you have room after your meal. 

The restaurant is always clean, including the bathrooms (seriously-thank you!). There aren't very many places that the whole family can agree on, but this is one. The Habit Burger is a solid place to eat lunch out on your own or with the family."}
{"text":"I will not be going back.  I am not upset; but extremely disappointed.

I went there last evening because a friend of mine had given it raves.  I ordered a double burger with cheese and mushrooms as a part of a combo meal.  Thank heavens I ordered a double!  And this is the reason for the bad rating:  when I opened up the sandwich, what I saw being passed off as burgers were two extremely small (less than 3 inches across), thin, overcooked discs.  You are a BURGER RESTAURANT!  The highlight of your name should be reflected by your product.  Nobody is going to make a habit out of those things!  For shame!

Now, that said, the staff was extremely attentive, the facility clean, and nicely decorated, and the french fries were quite good.  Maybe they should change the name of the place to \"fantastic fries with bad burgers on the side.\""}
{"text":"My friends and I come here all the time and will continue to do so! If you're feeling a little poor, the charburger will only set you back about three bucks. I sometimes get it protein style (lettuce wrap) if I'm feeling healthy that day. And if you're feeling particularly fancy, throw a pineapple ring and teriyaki sauce on it for only 50 cents more! The staff are super nice very helpful. Once they accidentally up charged me for a cheeseburger and gave me a coupon for my next visit. When you're done with your trays and if it's not busy, someone will come around and take it off your hands and ask how your food was. The ONLY complaint I have is that sometimes they like to skimp on the green bean fries. My friend on multiple occasions brought it back and the manager agreed there were too few and got her covered. There's outdoor seating for the cooler months and an optional complimentary valet (the parking lot gets full during peak hours). Thanks for being amazing, guys!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for charbroiled burgers. There's something about a beef patty being freshly grilled that just makes my tastebuds smile. And The Habit has definitely mastered the art of charbroiling!

I always order the Mushroom Char. It's a beef patty that has been seared to perfection then topped with grilled mushrooms, melted Swiss cheese, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo- All on a toasted sesame bun! Call me crazy, but I actually prefer mayo or thousand island as opposed to ketchup on my burgers. So I definitely approve of their choice of condiment!

Since eating a burger without fries is simply unheard of, we usually have 1 order of fries to share. They are pretty generous when it comes to portions, so 1 order is plenty enough. There's a little bar where you can get your ketchup, drinks, and even peppers! I really enjoy this since I love to eat jalapeños and pepperoncinis on the side.

The plaza that this burger joint is located in is super busy with other popular restaurants. Hubby and I usually make a quick stop here after I finish my classes at UNLV. It makes me actually look forward to my school days! After all, what's there not to look forward to? Charbroiled burgers, fresh ingredients, friendly staff members...

Needless to say, we definitely make it a \"habit\" to come here. (Sorry, I just had to!)"}
{"text":"I've gotten into The Habit on several occasions, as it's close to the office.... and each time I do, their Santa Barbara style American Double with a side of Green Beans, puts me in my fatty place.

After ordering, you take your vibrating drink coaster to a booth of your choosing.  The place has been fairly empty each time I've been there, so I make sure to grab a table right next to the only other seated couple.  I'll place the pager on the tabletop, grab a drink, and then peruse my phone.  Once the pager rattles against the table top, it's LOUD, like that vibrating football game from the 70s.  I let it resonate for about 30 seconds, pretending I'm really engrossed with my mobile device... I'm so precocious

The employees have always been friendly, the tables clean, and the condiment bar always has a heaping amount of jalapenos and those firm yellow pepper things that end up squirting spicy juice into my windpipe after biting into it, which temporarily causes me to gasp for air.

You never forget your first asphyxiation"}
{"text":"Wow - Wow and Wow! - OMG! - This place was suggested to me by my Uber Driver - I can't believe he was serious. I'm so glad that I took his advice and ventured over. The Yelp reviews are extremely accurate on this place. Trust me! Get the Santa Barbara Style Burger - Trust me - The Sour Dough was delicious and the Avocado was extremely fresh and tasty.

Next time around - I'm going to try the Fried String Beans. The Manager was kind enough to let me try a few; They were delicious.

As an aside - I just wanted to compliment and say what lovely and enthusiastic staff and management they had working the day of my visit. I took some pictures.

Staff were healthy and happy and eager to please customers like myself. I felt very comfortable during my visit.

Location was very clean! Food was excellent! - Great work!"}
{"text":"Only been here once. I didn't know this was a chain out of CA or anything. I just wanted a burger. I had no expectations.

Overall, our party was pleased. I can understand some of the comparisons to In-n-Out but I think I actually like this place better simply because they have more variety on the menu.  That's NOT a knock on In-n-Out, they simply don't have anything outside of burgers, fries, and shakes. Does somebody in your party like bacon, a different kind of sandwich, salad, or onion rings? Can't go to In-n-Out...

The quality of the food was good. Everything was hot, fresh, and tasty. We had charburgers, sweet potato fries, regular fries. No issues with anything. Not a bad deal as far as I'm concerned.

You can tell they're a little heavy on the corporate style right now in order to keep things going in the right direction with the new location, but it wasn't offensive to me, despite what appeared to be a high number of people appearing to be 'supervising'. Service was good. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I can always count on a delicious meal with great service. My favorite is the tritip sandwich on sourdough.. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"The first time I had Habit burger was in Cali, I wasn't impressed. But the few times I've had it from this location I really liked it. The burgers are tasty (get it with everything) and juicy. The fries always hot and crisp. My vanilla shake was suprisingly yummy as well. Service and staff is friendly and helpful. 
This is one of the few fast food places I go.
I recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place! Good food, fair prices and friendly staff. Clean establishment as well. I had the portobello burger added some jalapeño peppers and and ketchup and it was great! Cooked well and fries wee also tasty!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very clean, food is great and always fresh, and the employees are super nice and friendly!! We always have a good experience!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today for the first time and I must say that this is one of the best experiences I have had at a restaurant in a long time. I ordered a #1 and it was absolutely delicious. What impressed me even more was the customer service. The young lady taking our order wasn't trying to rush us and was very attentive. After I a placed my order I went over to get a drink. I noticed that they didn't have Dr. Pepper. I said to one my co-workers \"ahh, they don't have any Dr. Pepper, How can they not have Dr. Pepper\". So I settled for Coke and took my seat at the table. While we were waiting for our food, the Manager approached our table and handed me a large cup of Dr. Pepper. He walked next door and got me a Dr. Pepper. Wow.. I didn't even know he heard me say that.. I was VERY impressed. Even more so, he came back about 15 minutes later and offered to go get me a refill. Another young lady came by after we were done and offered to clear our table and refill our drinks. The food here is excellent no doubt, but the customer service here outstanding. Not only will I be back with more family and friends, I would recommend this place to EVERYONE! Thank you to the manager and his staff for going above and beyond and showing me that there are places out there that still care about their customers."}
{"text":"The owners crushed it!  What a great burger, juicy, great flavor, good bun and fresh....  the place is packed.  I loved the burgers......."}
{"text":"Decent food but there are better burger places to be had in close proximity. I like spicy food and there is nothing on the menu here that is spicy. The line to order is right in the middle of the restaurant so you are constantly cutting through to get drinks, food and napkins. Music is too loud to hold a good conversation and is of poor selection."}
{"text":"I used to frequent my old San Diego location all the time. Sooo glad they opened up out here. The only difference is its more expensive than SD but these burgers are too good not to indulge once in a while. Love this place."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have had great service and decent food - veggie burger has always been good. The last two visits have been disappointing. I had a swiss char with mushrooms. The bread on the bun was either stale or grilled to crunchy  - but just along one edge, the mushrooms were cold and the burger somewhat tasteless. maybe I need to go back to veggie and have it wrapped in lettuce."}
{"text":"Consistent, good, but nothing overly memorable. Now, that doesn't mean I wouldn't come back. If I saw it and was craving a burger I definitely would. 

I think the burgers are a step above traditional fast food burgers and the fries are a solid choice as well. I had the Santa Barbara char and it was huge, more of a patty melt kind of sandwich, and I could barely finish it. I also got a mocha milkshake which was probably my favorite thing about the meal. Mmmmmmm. 

My friends got a bbq chicken salad and regular char burger. They both had similar opinions, enjoyable but nothing keeping them at the front of their minds. 

Dining space was clean and prices are reasonable. If you wanna quick bite this is a good option around PV mall!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best burgers I've ever had! Beats smash burger, five guys, culvers, and even in and out which I love. The onions and cheese blend with bacon is so mouth watering, and the fries are perfect. Also good choice of ice tea. Service is great as well for a fast food joint, employees are very nice and smiley."}
{"text":"My first Habit Burger. I see why people get addicted. 
This is a great hamburger . I took only two napkins and this is three napkins burger. Fries and a Ginger drink topped it off very well 
The menu offers salad everything is fresh and made to your order. 
The location is convenient and very clean. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visited yesterday with my family.  We all loved it.  The staff was very kind and welcoming.  We even got a visit from the manager."}
{"text":"Food was very good!  It was a little slow getting to us but it was very busy so it didn't bother me. But I rated it 4 stars because of the crowd. They have limited indoor seating and we had to eat by the door with a ton of people waiting in line. I was there with a client and it wasn't a good lunch because of it. But.....great food and great service...I'd go back and adjust it to 5 stars I'm sure."}
{"text":"I had never heard of \"The Habit\"...until I noticed one of their outlets on Cactus Road...So much for  them being in existence for 40 years...I had no clue of their very existence...

And then another habit popped up, this one closer to my house - so I gave them a chance - funny enough they moved in on the same turf than In & Out at The Promenade where Baja Fresh used to be, right next to Flo's...

The former Baja Fresh space went under quite some transformation to resemble somewhat of a chic burger joint with lots of wood, comfy side booths etc...to give it a homey feeling...

Cutting down to the chase...the food, the staff, the concept: The menu offers everything from their specialty charburgers to salads, sandwiches and shakes and malts...The staff was very friendly and helpful...After realizing that I had misordered my burger as I wanted mine wrapped in lettuce, I was told \"No problem, where are you sitting ? and we'll bring it to you..\"...Wowzers...!...it was scrumptious...

And as much as  I enjoy In and Out, I must say that Habit's take on my lettuce burger is just downright wonderful...the meat patties and the lettuce cups are bigger and everything just seems even fresher..."}
{"text":"Consistent flavor from location to location makes you feel at home. Love this place. A++++ staff friendly restaurant is clean. Reminded me of my local habit."}
{"text":"Went there last night to eat for the first time and was rather disappointed.  The service was great, the food, just ok.  The hamburger reminded me of the animal style In & Out burger (sauce and fried onions).  The patties were from frozen, the fries from frozen.  Nothing special.  To be honest with you Culver's, Smashburger and Five Guys have much better food for the same price. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Average Burger, decent price, very friendly staff. However I would drive the extra five miles to Jones and Craig and go to Great Links for a much better Burger and sides, but admittedly a little more expensive. But just a few dollars more. This place is not as good as In N out but has a better selection. Not as good as Five Guys or Smashburger. Maybe comprable to Farmer Boys. But it will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Third location we have been to and no complaints yet from us! Every location we went to was on point and delicious! Just happened to drive by and saw this location and cut off three cars to get here! Lol, we both got char burgers mine with grilled onions mmmmm and my hubby got his plain! (Weirdo, lol jk). The bun, meat and toppings come together in a lovely medley of deliciousness and a great balance of flavors! Cheers! :-)"}
{"text":"This was a nice place to eat. The ambience was great and the food was very fresh and tasty.It was also very reasonably priced. I will be going back there."}
{"text":"Finally tried this  place after hearing great reviews about it for a long time!! I was not disappointed! The burgers were great quality!! Very juicy and delicious at a very reasonable price!! Also impressed with how quick i received my order and the friendliness of the staff! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times so far, and each time the service has been great.  The first time I went here, the person who helped me (I can't remember her name, but it began with an \"M\") took the time out to explain their menu, what the favorites are, what were new items, etc.  I decided to try their mushroom-swiss burger and their tempura-battered fried green beans with ranch dressing.  I know, I know, it's an odd combination, but trust me, it's pretty damn good.  Pure crack.  And best of all, it gives you that illusion you're eating something healthy-ish.  My only complaint is that I wish that the portion sizes were slightly bigger than what they offer.  But I guess they cater to those who are health freaks, which I'm not one of those people AT ALL!!!  LOL  So yeah - go try it out.  It's pretty good.  :)"}
{"text":"Awesome burger place. Great atmosphere. If you are looking for a great burger that doesn't take long than come here."}
{"text":"I came in here with a friend around midnight on Halloween. Needless to say it wasn't that busy. We were looking for a place to go eat in the middle of the night that wasn't fast food. We saw the pictures on Yelp and decided to come here. When we walked in we thought there was a mistake or the portion size was really small. $3 bucks for a burger? Our expectations immediately fell.

We ended up paying $10 for the Double Charburger w/ Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries, and a drink. Yeah just one Burger because my friend had already eaten earlier. They gave us a little beeper to pick up our food (probably because it gets really busy during lunch) and we sat down for about 5-8 minutes til we got our burger and fries.

Sweet potato fries. They weren't anything special. They didn't taste like they were seasoned well. It was bland, I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries anyways so I would have not enjoyed them anyway. Still I would recommend the regular fries unless those are bland too in which case just don't get fries.

The Charburger was a good size. It was the best tasting $3 burger I have ever tasted. It was the middle of the night so I was expecting the food to not taste fresh. Most restaurants do preps in the morning. I bite into it. It was amazing. The lettuce wasn't old, the tomatoes were fresh. All around great burger. Right remember when I said my friend had already eaten. She took a bite and decided to get one for herself. It was really good.

You ever wanted to be a criminal? Just come here. At their prices your basically stealing their burgers from them. I don't understand how they are making a profit. If you didn't tell me how much the food cost I would have expected the burgers to cost 8 dollars. Oh I forgot to mention customer service. It was good the cashier walked around and made sure that everyone was happy. So yeah in a nutshell Good burgers at a ridiculously cheap price with mediocre fries."}
{"text":"So the burgers were pretty good, as well as the shakes, though the malt tasted just like a regular shake. The place was pretty clean too. It was better tasting and slightly cheaper than the nearby Shake Shack. 

However the music selection was downright odd, and awful. It seemed like it was selected by someone with multiple personality disorder (no offense to those who actually suffer from it). It went from typical whining country music, to Destiny's Child, to Avril Lavigne, and other I don't know what. To add insult to injury it seemed to be the worst selection from every genre. I mean it was bad. It left me confused . And this is from someone who usually could care less about the music in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. 

The food is way better than most fast food/drive thru burger places (yummy tempura green beans, I see you), but the price reflects that. It's enough more, it is a place I don't come as often with my kids.

They have a drive thru, which makes me choose it over a similar competitor such as Smash Burger; but the drive thru is usually slow. I am thinking that may have something to do with the food being better quality?? 

I have never eaten inside, so I cannot speak to that experience."}
{"text":"I've ate here a total of 4 times. My first visit was a dine in and the other 3 were drive thru. My dine in service was excellent. My drive thru service has been ridiculous. First these girls in the drive thru are constantly reading back my order wrong or when I get to the window my drinks are wrong. It's so annoying!"}
{"text":"Lunchhhhhh timeeeeeeeeee. With five guys across the street. That's competition. I'm glad they are busy here. I like this place. Very spacious and great atmosphere. 

I got the Veggie burger lettuce wrap with tomatoes, jalapeños, cucumbers and avocados. Delicious and healthy. I think my sister had the char burger. I don't  remember, But she killed it...and the fries. Haha. 

We shall come back."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal! My family has claimed this place as our go-to burger place. Everyone gets what they want, how they want it. We have not had a bad experience at this location. Always a good idea."}
{"text":"Loved the burger!  Very fresh and the restaurant is very clean.  Workers are friendly and helpful!  Great food!!"}
{"text":"If you like Burger King then you will love this place! First time here and this place is seriously Terrible! Ordered a burger with cheese and even paid extra for cheese and didn't received any! Quality of meat is super cheap! Strawberry lemonade was gross! Fries super salty! Every table there was dirty and disgusting! Save your time and money this place is a total joke! Also the pepper idea would have been good but those were also soggy and nasty! Even 1 star is too much for this place!"}
{"text":"It's nothing real special. burgers are good fries are decent. chocolate shakes are good. You can order online and have things ready for you when you get there. The tri-tip isn't worth ordering. And the staff was courteous and friendly. That's about all I got for this place."}
{"text":"We usually love the habit and recommend it to family and friends all the time. We were SoooOo disappointed in this last visit and really considering NOT going back. 

We went through the drive thru and got 3 meals and 1 kids meal. All the burgers were ordered with bacon and I kid you not, there was half a piece of bacon in each burger. And it was a pathetic attempt at bacon, all limp and fatty. I cannot believe we paid extra on all the burgers to have half a piece of bacon in each one! The burgers were burnt and hard - like they were old or had been sitting there. The only thing good about the meal was the soda and the onion rings.

It's safe to say we will not be going back there any time soon. A complete disappointment!!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken club, lots of avocado which I loved. Husband ordered double burger, he liked it but didn't rave about it. Fries were so/so. His golden and crunchy, mine limp and kinda soggy- I'll give it another shot before deciding if I like this place or not."}
{"text":"Very reasonable. Not special.

$10 got me a double grilled with cheese, fries and a drink. The place was clean. Service was friendly. Ticket time was around 10 minutes.

Grilled burgers are the best IMO. So, this I liked. I could really taste the grilled flavor. And, the burger wasn't buried with too many condiments. The fries were tasty, not over-salted AND they stayed hot until after I'd finished the burger (something some other burger places could learn how to do!). The black iced tea was just so-so.

Here's the thing: $10 is a bit pricey for a lunch on any kind of regular basis. Especially when there are so many other choices at this price-point that gets you more food or a more \"sit down restaurant\" experience.

$10 for a dinner is inexpensive. This isn't really my idea of dinner, though.

So this is a tough spot for them to be in. Good food. Not necessarily the best bang for the buck.

Without a doubt better than many similar places - that fry the meat - and better, IMO, than the typical fast food franchises all of which come in a bit less pricey."}
{"text":"As many of you already know, I am a big fan of The Habit.  I worked next to the OG one up in Goleta, and would frequent it often.  Always had great meals there....ALWAYS!  When I moved from Santa Barbara down to San Diego, The Habit was one of the things I missed most.  Eventually, they opened up Habits outside of the Santa Barbara area, and made one in San Diego.  I would go there often, and the quality and consistency was just like the ones up in Santa Barbara/Goleta.  All this back story brings me to today.  Was craving a burger and wanted somewhere that the wife and son would enjoy.  We had yet to have gone to a Habit since moving to Arizona.  Today seemed like a good day for a Charburger.  We got in the card and drove on down to 7th Ave and McDowell. .  

We parked, walked in and were immediately greeted.  Habit's employees and customer service are always awesome!  No complaints there!  We placed our order for a Charburger, a Cobb Salad, a Santa Barbara style Charburger, some fries and some onion rings.  We got our pager, filled up our drinks, grabbed some napkins and ketchup and then grabbed a booth.  A few minutes later, our pager went off.  Here is how everything was.............

Santa Barbara Charburger-  This is a charburger with guacamole and cheese that is placed between 2 slices of grilled sourdough.  I had it once before and thought it was just ok.  I decided to try it out again today.  While it looked good, the first bite in, I could tell that something was different.  The meat was different.  It wasn't super hot and it seemed like it didn't have the typical char grilled marks that most Habit burgers have.  Habit burgers usually have a very distinct taste when you bite in.  This one did not.  It wasn't a horrible burger, but it was hands down the worst Habit burger I have ever had.  It wasn't just mine either.  My wife thought that hers tasted a little bit off, too.  She agreed that something wasn't the same as all of the CA locations.  

Cobb Salad-  This salad was my go to salad when I was on my low carb diet.  It has a ton of good stuff (eggs, avocado, bacon, chicken etc) that is low in carbs, and a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  We took a few bites into the salad and could tell something was different with the salad, too!  WTF?  One of the reasons for coming down here was for nostalgia purposes, and the 2 main items we had, were not what we are used to, and just weren't that good.  Once again, not horrible or anything like that, just not the same as all previous locations.  

Fries-  Fries were good.  These were the Habit fries that I had remembered.  My son liked them a lot.  No complaints here.  

Onion Rings-  The rings were fantastic!  Habit has some great onion rings.  These rings were great!  Just as I had remembered.

Overall, lunch was a little disappointing.  Maybe it was a one off (I have had 2 bad In N Out experiences so far in AZ and both times were from the same location..so it can happen with a particular location) and this Habit was just having a bad day?  Maybe this location just isn't that good?  Who knows?    

3 stars for the friendly customer service, good fries and rings, and they played some awesome music while we were there.  The burgers and salads were off though, and because of that, I don't think I will ever come back to this particular location.  I hope it is not an \"AZ Habit\" issue.  If it is, it will be a damn shame.  CA Habit's are the best and I hope to find the same consistency here in AZ....eventually ;-)."}
{"text":"I saw that this Habit recently opened, and I decided to stop in for a bite to eat on the way home from work.  

First of all, if you have read my other Habit reviews, you know I love the damn place.  Fell in love with the original one up in Goleta, and have always been a big fan.  I stopped by this new one tonight to grab a salad.  

If you have never had it, I would highly recommend the Santa Barbara Cobb Salad.  It is fucking awesome!  Shredded lettuce, tomato, egg, bacon, blue cheese, chicken, avocado and their creamy dressing.  By far my favorite salad of all time.  Always consistent, always delicious, and not too pricey for the size of the thing ($8.00 or so)!  I am not really a \"salad person\", but this thing is beyond great.  I could eat this every single day and never get tired of it.  Go get yourself one, stat! 

Service was incredibly personable and friendly.  The cashier was all smiles, looked everyone dead in the eyes, made ordering easy, and even offered me a cup for water while I waited for my salad.  A lot of fast casual restaurants have bumps on a log for their front facing employees and they just sit there stone faced and show no emotional connection to their customers.  Not the Habit! I have always encountered really good service at all the ones I have been to.  This one is no exception.  This lady was awesome!  

I am happy that they built one here!  It's now the closest one to my house in Surprise, and I'm sure I will be stopping by quite often.  Keep up the awesomeness, Habit!  Love you guys!"}
{"text":"My buddy Kevin texted me a few months back letting me know that they were going to open a new Habit, closer to our house (Surprise) than the other ones, and that it would have a drive thru!  What, what?  I was stoked!  We became friends up in the Goleta/Santa Barbara area, which was where the Habit originated.  We used to work about a block away from the very first, original location in Goleta.  I have always loved their food and was super excited to have one close by.  Today I decided to make my way down here.

I got off the 10 on 99th and then made a left on McDowell. Its a few blocks down on the left hand side.  I pulled into the lot and made my way around towards the drive thru. First Habit I have seen with a drive thru!  About that....... The Habit is probably one of those places that SHOULDN'T have a drive thru.  They make everything fresh and aren't exactly the speediest when it comes to getting your food out (not turtle slow or anything, just longer than other freshly cooked spots).  I got in the drive thru at 3:40pm and there were maybe 5 cars in front of me.  I finally got up to the drive thru speaker and placed my order for a Santa Barbara Cobb Salad.  4:15pm, I was finally parked, eating my food.  If you come here to the drive thru, plan on being in line for a while!  Because they cook everything fresh, each car in front of you has to wait on average 5-8 minutes to get their food.  Unless I have my kids in the car, next time I am definitely walking in and ordering.  I finally did get my food and pulled into the parking lot to grub down.  Here is how it was...............

Santa Barbara Cobb Salad-  I opened my bag to remove my salad, and noticed that there were no napkins in the bag.  I hate when that shit happens!  Not a complete deal breaker, but really, how hard is it to throw in 2-3 napkins?  Anyways........  I ordered my dressing for my salad on the side, and they hooked it up with 3 dressings (only used 2) which I appreciated.  I took the lid off my salad and it looked and smelled fantastic!  (I had been to the Habit down on 7th a couple of times, and was never too impressed.  It was not as good as the Santa Barbara/Goleta locations, or even as good as the Mission Valley location in San Diego.)  I poured my dressing on the salad, mixed it in and dug in.  The SB Cobb salad comes with a bunch of shredded lettuce, a chopped up egg, tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, grilled chicken, bacon, and a nice sized scoop of avocado!  This salad was awesome!  Every component worked together in harmony.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, bacon was crisp and crunchy, the avocado was soft and delicious, the lettuce fresh and crisp, the tomatoes perfectly ripe, the blue cheese crumbles provided a nice \"bite\" and the dressing is not too heavy.  Pretty much a perfect salad, and definitely perfect if you are on a low carb diet!  I scarfed that thing down in mere minutes and was completely satisfied.

Overall, I will definitely be back!  With it being only about a 20 minute drive from my house, too, I should be back often.  I don't think I would use the drive thru again though...took way too long.  Service from the cashier who took my order and handed me my food was friendly and all smiles.  Glad to have this place here and the delicious salad today reminded me of why I fell in love with The Habit back in the day!  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Habit is probably my favorite burger place right now. And I am so happy that they have a location in the north side because it's near my house!! It's never a super long wait when I come here and they have very friendly workers who will help you right away. In every Habit location I've been to, I appreciate the fact that they always keep their restaurant neat and tidy, which is a plus compared to other burger places. 
So I usually get the charburger and add bacon, but this time I decided to get the Veggie Burger and I added onions and avocado! It was pretty good! The patty was huge and ended up larger than the bun. My only complaint is that they loaded up my burger with avocados so it was so slippery and messy. Good thing I like avocados though."}
{"text":"Love their food and they always have amazing service! I love that they are really good with kids and will wrap any sandwich in lettuce."}
{"text":"Great place! Great veggie burger and tempura green beans! Clean, fresh ingredients and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Few days ago, I went to Habit for the very first time with my boyfriend! All I can say is that is was deeeeelicious!! Im picky when it comes to my French fries so I always ask for extra crispy. My boyfriend is picky with what he likes on his burgers. The cashier had no problem giving us everything we asked for. She was very sweet! Everyone else seemed very nice, too. The place has outside seating but we sat inside. It was very clean and the bathrooms were clean as well. Overall, great restaurant! Also, they have THE BEST strawberry limeade."}
{"text":"Of all the new burger places, The Habit is my favorite. Love their onion rings. Any place that has onion rings and sweet potato fries is a plus for me. 

Hamburgers are good. Service was excellent. This location has a drive thru and is on the way home from my work. A dangerous combination. ;-)"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom yesterday. We both had chicken sandwiches with no cheese. She got the teriyaki, I got the barbecue. We split an order of half onion rings have sweet potato fries.  

The chicken sandwiches were excellent. The onion rings and the sweet potato fries were also good too. Service was friendly and helpful. I prefer the onion rings over the sweet potato fries. We saw some people next to us eating salads and they looked very nice.  I like their little pepper bar where you can get jalapeños and sweet peppers. 

I'm looking forward to trying another Habit on my side of town and seeing what their hamburgers are like. 

Definitely a new option for a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Burnt food.   

Went at 8:00 at night.  Sat at the drive thru window for 12 minutes for two burgers and a chicken sandwich.  Staff was chatting and carrying on in the kitchen - after what felt like an awkwardly long time they bagged my order - I briefly checked it . . . When I got home I discovered the fries were missing, burger was not as ordered, and a bun was burnt.   

I really felt like I was an inconvenience and interruption to their chatting.   So I called to talk to the manager I saw in the kitchen  - the number is for a phone ordering service only !  They listened to my complaint with a care less attitude and immediately let me know they have no direct line to the store - that there is no way to call directly to the store.  

Are they kidding ???"}
{"text":"After a sincere apology from the owner and a request to come back to the store and make amends, I am happy to say that at least the higher positions in the store know true customer service. 

Granted, I will admit my fault for not reading the sign correctly for their hours between the drive-thru and the actual store. However, because of this experience and other reviews, I know that I am not the only one who got mixed up with the Hours and found it confusing. It also doesn't change the fact that I really did feel a sense of rudeness coming from one of the workers who was cleaning and just staring at me. 

But let's move on to the food now. 

When I went for my 2nd meal, I noticed the inconsistency of their food. I understand mediocre food if the prices are dirt cheap like normal fast food joints, but the prices here are much steeper, and because of that, I expect to get the same quality of food every time I go. 

The saving grace from my last review here was the fries. They were thin-cuts, super crispy, lightly salted, and just wonderful. When I came, I got soggy ones, as if they've been out from the fryer for a while now. 

So without the mix-up of the hours in my scoring, I would still rate this place at an average of three stars."}
{"text":"Good flavors in the burgers I had the BBQ bacon char and my wife had the Mushroom char and my daughter had the grilled chicken salad with really crispy salad it was good quality we will be back. Price is average plan on about $10/person"}
{"text":"I discovered this place as it's in a good location for lunch during weekday lunch breaks. I've tried their #1 charburger, #2 double charburger, and mushroom char. Everything tastes great, and service is relatively quickly considering how busy they get during lunchtime. I would say this is my second favorite fast burger place behind in-n-out. If you're hungry, get the combos (#1 or #2). If you're starving, get the #2, it will fill you up. Just keep in mind that adding cheese to your burger is a bit extra charge, as well as switching your fries in the combo from regular to sweet potato fries. If you get all that as a #2, with cheese and sweet potato fries, everything comes out to a little over $10, which is worth it for me. Their sweet potato fries are super good, tastes very fresh. Also try their strawberry lemonade, it's full of flavor and very refreshing. It's a great place for lunch, and if you're in the mood for burgers, this place is definitely a good option!"}
{"text":"So i go here all the time love it. Im from Santa Barbara so a bit of home away from home. But today was even better melanie went above and beyond witch goes along way with me. Just wanfed to show her some love on here. Keep up the amazing job you are the best they got at this store.

Thank you"}
{"text":"Fresh food to order! Friendly staff! The burgers are fresh and delicious! For vegetarians, the veggie burger is flavorful and mouth watering. The tri-tip is juicy and you can taste the char on the meat. So happy they are finally in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Maybe one of my all time favorite burgers! I got mine lettuce wrapped, the bbq char, and this is a place that does lettuce wrapping right! Plenty of wrap to hold the burger, and not have to use a fork/knife, but you can still enjoy all the flavor of burger!! Very fine line! Perfect burger for my low carb habits! My kiddo had fries, and they weren't super hot, not totally impressive, but I also wouldn't call them bad. Hubs had the double char lettuce wrapped, which was just as delicious. Very yummy tropical tea as well! The best thing about this location though, the service was excellent. Several attentive workers grabbing trash and asking if we needed anything! Although busy, everyone had smiles and it felt like we were the only people in the restaurant. I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"With the recent explosion of burger concepts popping up everywhere, this one seems to still be growing as a company but doesn't stand out at all. Tasted just like any other burger. Definitely not a \"habit\" to consider trying. On to the next one..... Great service, normal product."}
{"text":"Random late night craving for burgers led me to this place, and I am glad it did.  They have the best burgers/sandwiches I have ever had from a \"fast food\" place.  Fresh ingredients, well cooked, and overall a good experience.

I had their BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and also tried their Fresh Albacore Tuna.  Both were delicious, but I was extremely impressed with the latter.  Every ingredient was good on its own, but they really came together in the right proportions in that sandwich.  Lastly I love that they have sweet potato fries, because I am not really a fan of regular fries, and they are a welcome alternative."}
{"text":"I love Habit Burger. The staff has always been super friendly. I've always found the dining room as well as the restrooms to be clean. The negative would be the parking. Depending on the time of day and how many are hanging out at Starbucks, the parking lot can be full. There is plenty of parking however towards the Fry's store so it's easy to find a spot over there.
On this visit, C ordered the kids hamburger with cheese (55 cents extra), Apple sauce and chocolate milk. $4.50. I ordered the #1. Charburger with cheese, no Mayo. Comes with fries and a medium drink. $7.05.
Whoa. How much change am I getting back from my $20? I mean at Fatburger, 5 Guys, Smashburger, Burger 21 etc... I get back some coins and maybe a buck or two when C and I go out for dinner. Nice.
C said his kids burger was great. Patty fit the bun and it wasn't cooked like a hockey puck which a lot of places do when it's a kids burger. My burger was also nicely cooked and very tasty. I love the fries here almost as much as the fries from In n Out. My burger dollar goes farther here, the food is very good and you don't get a smackdown buying a kids meal. Oh, and the manager Will, he's awesome.
Great Burgers, Great Food, Great prices. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...
We ordered 4 Charburgers and a kids meal. The kids meal was the only thing correct.
Burger 1 missed the bacon
Burger 2 missed bacon and pickles were terrible
Burger 3 was a combo and they forgot the fries
Burger 4 missed the BBQ sauce and Bacon

We ordered online, waited in the drive thru for the onion rings and drinks while the burgers got cold.

Burgers were very greasy and not much flavor. 

Overall it was a $50 mess, I will not be back and will warn others to check drive thru orders as they don't seem to have the needed skills to get it correct."}
{"text":"My bf loves this place. I do too, their food and the price are great. The workers are always nice and friendly. We eat here atleast once a week lol. Definitely recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the green beans tempura are must have!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out & I finally did. I had heard such amazing reviews on the Habit. We ordered the teriyaki burger, sourdough burger with avocado & sweet potato fries. All the food was absolutely hands down amazing & delicious. 
Additionally, this particular location also great. The staff was friendly & restaurant was extremely clean. I would highly recommend the Habit & will definitely return in the near future."}
{"text":"I used to live in Tempe and had been at thir location there a few times and thought it was good but nothing to rave about. I tried this one a few days after it opened since I was running errands in the area and had been in the mood for a burger for a week or so. Just driving by and having the aroma hit me clinched my lunch decision.

I was thoroughly satisfied with every phase of my decision. The service was great and so was the food. I had a charburger with the works and added jalapeno slices and ketchup to it. The onion rings were great and had that homemade look to them, not the production line ones you get elsewhere. I had only just started on them when one of the girls working there stopped by to offer me an additional batch because the manager felt the quantity was a bit skimpy. Nice!

I finished up my meal with a Mocha shake which was really good also. I would definitely consider eating there again."}
{"text":"A bit too much hype, I guess. Went there last night and had the char burger with onion rings. The rings were great, done perfectly and there was plenty of them. But the burger had no wow factor at all. It was okay, but I've had a lot, lot better ones. I'd picked up some jalapeño slices from the self-serve bar, and was glad I did, because they gave the burger some much-needed zip.

A good service experience, but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"My favorite chain burger place by far. The chicken sandwich is also amazing, you can't go wrong. The prices are fair and the service is quick. The milkshakes are also very good, could be thicker but that's just personal preference."}
{"text":"For the price this place is awesome. The gentleman taking our order noticed we were newbies and gave us a few tips and was extra friendly. Good service goes a long way with me. 

On a keto diet so no carbs. Was able to get a delicious burger with a lettuce bun, very layered lettuce bun, best I've ever had. They forgot the bacon I had added but when brought to their attention they quickly rushed me out a fresh side and even offered to remake. The patty was a little small, but for me it was perfect because I'm on a low protein high fat diet.  

My husband had the Cobb salad and added an ahi filet (4+oz for $3.79!!) he enjoyed his salad! 

I also received a side salad with ranch, love restaurant ranch. Basic side salad. 

Both had sodas and walked away spending about $20 for dinner. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The hype was not enough to make me like this place.  
The fries were tough and gummy as were the onion ring coating.
The burger although tasty (likely due to the heavy salty seasoning and sauce)
was a hot mess. You couldn't pick it up without the innards dropping all over your hands and the double was too big to fit in most mouths. I ended up having to empty out most of the fixings just to make it edible.
It ranks slightly above fast food in quality but the mess makes it not worth the effort."}
{"text":"Yum! Always busy and that's bc they have sweet potato fries!!!! Great service and yummy hamburgers!! Plus they provide vinegar!"}
{"text":"What is the point of making a phone order if you have to pay by credit card, no option to pay cash upon pickup?   The call is routed to a call center, then the order is sent to the restaurant 12 minutes later and you have to wait another 10 minutes?"}
{"text":"Their chicken sandwiches are great not a big fan of their burgers though , reasonably priced fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"Smelled great when walking into the shop! Was excited to see their diverse menu for a burger joint (ie chicken, fish, salad options for example). 

Wait time was reasonable for the volume they were pumping out for a Friday night. Cost was about $10 a person for my bill and that was for two sandwiches + sweet potato fries to share. 

Taste was okay but my biggest qualm is that neither mine or my husbands burger meat was hot in temperature. That's a show stopper for me when it comes to second visit."}
{"text":"An OUTRAGEous Experience!

I am flabbergasted by today's visit. After making the always difficult decision of what to eat for lunch, I couldn't get the thought of a juicy, flavorful burger out of my mind. So after ordering my typical Teriyaki Burger, med-rare, sans onions and waiting the ever long wait time of five-ish minutes. I was shocked to see a sandwich that looked nothing like the burger I had envisioned just minutes earlier. 

The look on my face, dumbfounded and deflated, must have been the clue to the lady presenting me with this meal that something was not right. After explaining to her that I thought I had ordered the Teriyaki Burger, she apologetically took the sandwich back. After reordering my burger, said I could take the Tri-tips sandwich home and try it. On top of that, since it cost more than the burger, she tried to force a free sandwich coupon my way. Who does she think I am? I refused of course! You can't buy my integrity with free food! No way!  

Of course I'll be back and continue to eat their delicious burgers. Maybe even the occasional Tri-tips sandwich depending on how good this one tastes for dinner. 

Thank you management and staff for a great meal and service at a great price!"}
{"text":"I can't complain about this place. Not the best burger ever but very delicious. The staff is very friendly let's just say and everything is fresh. If I could have I'd tip the staff. The fries are great, prices are great. Overall, very satisfied. Will update my review when I come back!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Food is always fresh, hot and delicious.  As my 8 uear old would say \"Best onion rings everrrrrr\"."}
{"text":"Service was poor. Took a long time to get the food from the time I ordered it. Disappointed in the burger. It was very dry and lacked flavor. The bun was a little over toasted. One star because the french fries were good. I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of charbroiled burgers, but this place is bomb! 
The service is always fast, the environment is always clean and the staff is always friendly.
My 2 favorite things (which I never order at any other restaurant) are the char chicken club with avocado and bacon on grilled sourdough and the tempura battered green beans! YUM! Their fries are pretty good, but honestly I prefer the green beans and I don't even like green beans! 
The food here is really cheap and I like that they give you one of those buzzers when you order so you can do your own thing and not have to listen much to them calling our orders.
The only reason I give this place 4/5 stars is because they've messed up my order 2 and gave me the wrong amount of change a few times. Little mistakes, but they were also on little orders. So review your receipts and the money you spent! 
Also I think it's funny when you walk in the door the \"manager\" says \"HI! How are you?\" Without ever looking up, I find that strange. Lol"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch during their opening, and it was very good.  Everyone keeps comparing them to 5 Guys, but I wouldn't agree.  The burgers are good, but different than 5 Guys. The onion rings were awesome and for that I would here first.  The variety was nice, and I have returned a few times for lunch.  

The service is always consistent, not the fastest, but the food is made to order, so it's expected.   Habit Burger Grill is definitely on my list of places to go when I am craving a good burger.  The fries put them over the top."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best fast food burger bar none. The meat is fresh and is Charbroiled on an old fashioned flat broiler which gives it a far superior taste just like you were cooking it over Charcoal in your back yard. Forget the conveyor broilers that Burger King and Carls Jr now use. The service is great too. They cook your burger and bun fresh to order and immediately serve it to you. No holding it in steamer cabinets like Ronald McD and the BKing do for hours. Menu also includes grilled sourdough option, fries are always fresh and hot, great charbroiled chicken sandwiches, freshly made creative juice options too. They also have all-you-can-drink Strawberry Lemonade and Mango punch drinks that are custom made in the stores and delicious at regular drink prices. Wayyyyyy better place with way better food. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"First of all great and tasty burguers!!
Best part tho, we had a problem with our order and they handled it so good, excelent customer service at the stephanie and warm springs location !!"}
{"text":"Had the Char Burger w/cheese. What I loved about it was the toasted 'around the edges' bottom bun! The hamburger needed lil salt and pepper or something. But, all in all a nice place to get a tasty burger w/lettuce 'n tomatoes. My friend had fries and they were tasty!  I'll stop in here again!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, super clean dining room, quick service.  What more do you want in a fast food place?    The format of this establishment is very similar to In-and-Out but with a few more item choices.  The food is fresh and well prepared.  The grilled tuna sandwich is my personal favorite.   The wife likes the fried green beans and the grilled tuna salad.  

You can't go wrong with making The Habit your habit."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars (watch out for the mayo!)
Ambiance: 4 stars
Value for money: 4 stars

I was impressed with the ambiance of this new restaurant on Stephanie. It was much nicer than I expected and the service was friendly and very efficient. This place was surprisingly busy at 3pm on a Saturday considering it has not been open very long.

The menu is pretty basic, but had some nice surprises that you don't see at the typical burger joint. We tried the albacore tuna sandwich which was fairly priced at $6.99 and was made with a grilled tuna steak. We also tried the signature charburger and got it with a lettuce wrap. They also offer different burgers, salads, milk shakes, and soft serve cones.

The highlight of our visit was the drink selection. They have a delicious strawberry cucumber limeade and flavored fresh ice teas along with the standard soda offerings. 

Unfortunately the food was a little dissapointing. The charburger is very similar to an in and out burger, but is not nearly as good. The tuna sandwich was okay, but did not have any seasoning. Both items had way to much mayonnaise!  Both items were lacking flavor, and the French fries are pretty standard but good. 

Given the value and ambiance of this place I might try it again some day, but I will not go out of my way to eat here again. 5 Guys, Smash Burger, and In And Out are much better burger chains."}
{"text":"Solid tasty fast food burger. Liked that the buns were toasted and the caramelized onions were tasty. Fries were fine."}
{"text":"Just tried the Habit for the first time tonight. The burgers were tasty, not GREAT, but good. The fries were a bit soggy and soft, but still tasted good. The atmosphere was clean, and the staff was friendly...but...a 30 minute wait on a Thursday night to get my to go order? UNACCEPTABLE!

10 minutes in line, and then 20 minutes waiting get my food. For a restaurant of this kind, that is just crazy. Not sure if the food was good enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a burger(not gourmet), just tomatoes, onion, lettuce and ketchup with a side order of amazing french fries(the big square kind) hot out of the fryer, you will love this place.  The only thing missing is an ice cold beer.  It is the burger and fry combination I have been in search of.  Throw back to a real bar and grill burger back in the day."}
{"text":"Great prices and yummy burgers!  They also have a jalapeño bar!  Fast and yummy, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Had burger combo #2 and was awesome.  Better than smash burger or 5 guys."}
{"text":"Great burgers at a decent price.  Service was friendly and prompt and the atmosphere is awesome.  This is my new favorite local burger joint."}
{"text":"First time here & it made a great impression.  Staff was very helpful & friendly, menu had many choices & the cost was surprisingly low!  I ordered a salad, thinking for 6.00 it would be small, wrong!   I took 1/2 of it home!    Kids meal looked tasty & my son had zero complaints!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I think I actually like it better than In and Out Burger.  I also like that they give you the beepers for your order, just makes it easier than trying to figure out an order number or name.  The burgers and chargrilled and delicious.  I reccomend."}
{"text":"Mmmm... Double char burger is excellent.  Tastes like a char-grilled burger.  I also love their fries, they're long and skinny, and bigger than In & Out Burger's.  Habit Burger has an interesting look to them, they look like little houses or something.  They look like they have a little tower or top story, there is a window up there anyways.  Inside they are clean and cozy.  The food is great and I love how they give you the pager so you can wait for your order and then know immediately when it's ready.  Service is top notch here as well. Did I mention the prices are great too?  Way cheaper than Smashburger and Five Guys."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers you will ever eat. If you like char-grilled burgers, this is the place to go. Cheese will be hot and melted, meat is tender but has a char taste to it.  Delicious.  They have three types of unsweetened iced tea, and the service was insane.  I had at least 5 people come up to my table asking if I needed anything."}
{"text":"The BF and I tried Habit for lunch today and really liked it. I had a burger with cheese and he had a double burger with cheese meal. I also had a side caesar salad. I really liked that this place puts grilled onions on the burger and the fact that they have a lot of different sides to choose from. My salad was better than expected for a fast food place. I tried a fry and thought it was good, nice and crispy. The burgers were a good size, not so big that I felt sick after eating it, but  filling. I think if I wanted to get a fast food burger again, I would come here over In and Out (I'm not a fan of in and out.... always leaves an oily feel in my mouth). The people who work there were also very friendly, their credit card reader wasn't working, but the lady at the register was still really nice despite looking a bit stressed. Another girl who works there offered to take our tray on her way back to work from her lunch break. Anyway, it was a good place, I want to go back to try their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Had a burger here several times brilliant service, and food etc glad to see one in Vegas hope Vegas is as good than Santa Cruz"}
{"text":"The burger was delicious. It was a little busy with not a whole lot of tables but when your food is good that isn't really something to complain about. And even though they were a bit busy the food came out in a timely manner. The price wasn't too bad either."}
{"text":"This location of habit burger grill are the most friendly people ever! Have gone there many times now as they have one of the best burgers in town and for cheap but it is always a great experience! Recently went and were given free malts and a free meal, soo nice of them!! Good karma and will pay it forward. Highly recommend this joint and location it's always been super fresh and they will continue to get my business for many to come.... Excellent service."}
{"text":"Look this is a good one way if fatburger and five guys had a baby this would be it.. everything is orginal and the fries are bomb... this place is just fire!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my coworkers and had a pleasant experience. Place is clean and organized. Food prices are affordable. This place is like one step up from drive thru fast food, kind of like how Chipotle is to Taco Bell. Forgot the name of my burger I had but it was good. Finished my burger and fries super fast."}
{"text":"I dont mind waiting a little longer for good food. Ive only had the burgers and they were all good. Especially the teriyaki and the bbq."}
{"text":"The facility itself is very nice, it's really clean. The entrance was crowded and the line was right by the front doors. It made it awkward standing in line while ppl are eating and more people were coming in.  

Karen the young woman working the register, lacked personality, she wasn't helpful considering I've never been before.  She was down right rude to us. 

The food, well it wasn't that great (much rather of gone to shake shack or in n out). The hamburgers tasted like the burgers from Johnny Rockets and the regular fries weren't that great either; actually they were pretty bad. 

They do have many options of salads to choose from. Maybe I'll come back here and try a salad. I won't come
Back for a burger that's for sure; they just weren't that \"come back again\" kind of burger."}
{"text":"Looking for a good burger and not on the strip in a big hotel and got this location on Flamingo. I have passed this place for a while thinking about stopping and finally glad I did. The food is cooked to order (A+), the menu is very versatile for lunch, not all burgers(A+).. the condiments like the Ranch and Tarter sauce tasted freshly made (A+), they offer a couple of teas, specialty drinks other might up charge you for at the same price as the fountain selection (A+) and the combo meals they offer are very filling. All in all the food in my opinion was way better than any other fast food place, not sure I would call this fast food, but definitely good food with awesome prices."}
{"text":"Holy mouth water. This place is fantastic. It is located in the Albertsons shopping center and boasts a drive through. So if you're craving a burger bad and left your house in pj's jonesing for one you can get here in 5 minutes from Mountains Edge. 

I ordered the charburger wrapped in lettuce with all the toppings (mayo, pickle, tomato, lettuce, caramelized onion) and fries ($7 total). Like a true burger lover and a terrible yelper I forgot to take a picture of my delicious burger because I was so dang hungry. I am pregnant so I could also blame it on pregnancy brain either way I will be back so stay tuned for a picture!

I came her with Kristy L. and she ordered a absolutely delicious looking BBQ chicken salad. It was HUGE and at $7 is a fantastic deal. Everything is so reasonably priced so it is a great family friendly outing. 

Everything is made fresh and you can taste it! I am so glad this place opened up right down the street. Come try it!"}
{"text":"The first Habit Grill I visited was in Santa Barbara.  I had the turkey burger.  Unfortunately, this location does not serve turkey burgers. The Strawberry Balsamic Chicken Salad was a good substitute, though.  It was sweet and savory and refreshing.  

I spoiled myself and got the half onion rings half sweet potato fries. They were perfectly fried.  Both had crispy crusts and most centers."}
{"text":"Very good service, our order was prepared quickly. Messed up on one burger, but quickly fixed it. I would definitely eat here again, if I ever travel here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were wanting to try habit for a while. You'll really enjoy this place if you're craving greasy burgers and fries. I had the Santa Barbara - it's amazing and so filling as it's a double patty but it has yummy avocado on it and on sourdough bread which is unique. My husband has the double cheeseburger with bacon that was great as well. We had fries and onion rings which were yummy too. The onion rings came with a good ranch dip. I also indulged in a chocolate shake that was a good thick milkshake!
Would definitely go back when wanting to indulge!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Habits food in the past so the low score is based on their customer service. I placed a take out order and they gave me the option of cooking the fries right when I arrived. However that didn't happen as it took 15 minutes  for them to get my fries out once I told them I was there, all while my burger was the just sitting on the counter getting cold. No apology from them, just an explanation that they accidently erased my order. Next time I might just make the extra long drive so I don't have to deal with this team again"}
{"text":"The last 2 times I've eaten here have been disappointing. The first time the gel working he drive through was crazy rude. The second time the chicken on my salad was inedible. It had the grossest texture and no flavor and was cold."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now and both times the burger patty tasted as if they reheated yesterday's meat. It just had a funky taste, I couldn't eat much of it. Over priced and pretty gross. Two stars for the friendly staff, and the onion rings weren't bad."}
{"text":"Always delicious food and AMAZING customer service. Sweet potato fries and their RANCH is MMMMM. Everyone always has a smile on their face and he few times there was a mistake they were sure to fix it above and beyond expectation with a happy attitude. I always get either the mushroom Swiss burger or the tuna steak on French roll. We have some food allergies and they're always accommodating and willing to look at their ingredients. This is our number one fast food staple when we're in a hurry- my only complaint is there isn't one super close to our home :) soon habit! Soon!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed at the habit! The charburgers are always tasty and the service is always accommodating.  If you've never had the habbit I feel bad for your taste buds. The wife had a chicken salad and that was very good as well. Almost want to get that next time and see if it fills me up like the burger does."}
{"text":"YUM!! I can't believe I had never been to The Habit Burger Grill previously. My boyfriend works at UNLV and goes to this location often. I met him for lunch and have always heard great things about the food.

What impressed me most was the service. I would've never expected to received such friendly, attentive service at a fast food restaurant. Our cashier (I believe her name was Asia) was phenomenal. When she found out that I had never been there before, she came out from behind the counter with a paper copy of the menu and went over their most popular items. 

I decided to order the Santa Barbara, because I love sourdough bread and anything with avocado is a winner in my book. My BF ordered the chicken sandwich, but made a bunch of modifications to it. I also ordered fries and he had onion rings.

Everything was really delicious. The onion rings are really a highlight - they are beer battered and SUPER crispy. My burger was really good as well. During our meal, Asia came back and checked on us to ensure that we were enjoying everything. 

I'll definitely be back when we meet for lunch again. Note that this place is in a busy area and will get PACKED at lunch time."}
{"text":"Got raw chicken tonight for the second time. I informed the manager before and it's still happening. The manager doesnt fix problems when they come and i think a serious issue like not handling and cooking food properly should be fixed. The first time it happened i was six months pregnant."}
{"text":"Service was great. The cashier and management staff were friendly and patient. Food was what I expected, Good. Everything was made fresh, priced were reasonable. We also enjoyed the malt shakes. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love the tri tip sandwich. I get it without the sauce and it's still so juicy. 

When ordering it can be annoying. They should ask if you are first visitor or not because all the questions are annoying. I know what I want just let me tell you it's much faster then you asking if each individual item is ok. I'm sure it may help with order accuracy but it just gets on my nerves."}
{"text":"Second time here. Great tasting burger that won't break your pockets. Seasoned and filling. My eyes were bigger than my stomach my first visit I got the double char burger and it was more than enough. This trip I went with the single and sweet potato fries .. delicious!"}
{"text":"I like this joint.  I didn't realize it was a chain until after my first visit - had more of a locally-owned feel to it.  The value is pretty good considering what other joints charge for similar fare.  The burgers are charbroiled and tasty, the onion rings are above-average, and the very reasonably priced side salad was far more and better than I expected for its price.  Close to work and will definitely make my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great burgers. I choose this place over in-n-out, never had any trouble with the food. My wife and I have always loved The Habit Burger Grill and they've never let us down. If you're looking for a well grilled burger this is the place!"}
{"text":"\"Meh.\" That's literally how I felt eating my Habit burger. My husband ordered a regular charburger and I ordered the bacon bbq charburger and I wasn't a fan; he had no complaints. However, he wants me to point out that he isn't too hard to impress.  I prefer my bbq sauce more sweet than savory and I think that would have been a much better way to go combined with the caramelized onions, the bacon, and the pickles. It was like a salt bomb in my mouth. I did like their sweet potato fries though. The service was quick and friendly and it's in a good location, surrounded by a bunch of other casual dining places so there's plenty of options in case you aren't feeling burgers. Overall, the food was nothing to write home about but it wasn't bad, by any means. If my husband wanted to go back, I'd go back and get some more fries."}
{"text":"My wife and I had to try it after hearing that it was ranked the number one place for burgers. Being a fan of In N Out, I has high expectations for this place. Let's just say that this place did not disappoint.

I ordered the Double Char burger. Great consistency with the meat and perfect ratio of meat to bun. Also, the jalapeño and chili pepper bar helps add an extra added bonus to the flavor of the burgers.

Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love heir hamburgers but it seems that they give you more fries when you dine in then when you go through the drive through"}
{"text":"Good burger is here.  Have it your way.  Delicious tempura green beans only 30 cents up charge on fries.  Loved my mocha malt.  Salads are solid.  Interesting non-soda drinks.   Pricing and service are good.  If you're hungry get a double patty.  Ambiance is nice for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Stopped at this Habit because we were nearby..excellent choice they have outside seating and since it was a cool evening enjoyed their patio area. Great service too. All habit restaurants have freshness..best burger joint and the sweet potato fries are by far best amongst all competition."}
{"text":"The habit has great burgers onion rings and sweet potato and reg fries. The taste is delicious, prices aren't bad either. Service is good too.Fiancé and I always argue which place to grab burgers from habit or smash burger...hands down for me I'd rather eat the habit!"}
{"text":"We've been a few times, the service is good and the food is a good quality. Our little ones enjoy the little gummy burger that comes with their meals. It's actually a nice touch vs. a silly toy that ends up broken or in the trash!"}
{"text":"Pretty good veggie burger. Even better service. Employees are great. Better than any other burger place for the price. always fresh. Glad they're in Vegas now."}
{"text":"my first experience wasn't so great I wasn't really a fan but i ate here again today and might I say I'm glad I didn't rule them out totally I had the santa Barbara charburger that mf was bomb! and the sweet potato fries I loved it and it all was hot and well done I  know what to get now when I go"}
{"text":"This place does great burgers. They are big and juicy and made to order. I can't say anything about their other sandwiches as I've never tried them, but there's no need to! Come here for a burger and you'll go away happy."}
{"text":"Why does my husband want to keep coming to Habit Burger? It's no In & Out anymore. That's so last whatever. Isela and Maggie are terrific. Everyone is. I love the string beans. Thank you Maggie
 Remember you were out of chocolate ice cream?  You made me something even better!!! Should I tell or make them ask you? Ask Maggie!"}
{"text":"Place was very nice, and very clean. Awesome staff. A little bit over priced compared to most burger spots. And the burger was a little small to me, I enjoyed the burger, but I definitely have had better. The fries were good, but nothing special. I did like the place but the value wasn't quite there for me."}
{"text":"Can't complain. Good burger and onion rings. I was in and out with my to go order in under 10 minutes and everyone was friendly. Definitely my new go to burger place."}
{"text":"This place is great to get a burger and frys. The santa Barbra hamburger is awesome!   I like the frys as they are thick and have a great taste.  I also like the tempura green beans with ranch.   My only complaint is when I get the burger it's not really cut in half.  So when I try and split it (because the santa Barbra is Big!). Some one always gets ripped off!    
And the lemonade in the store is pretty good too."}
{"text":"My wife and I think that this is the best burger place in town. Fair prices. Great hamburgers. Great french fries. Friendly staff. To quote Samuel F. Jackson,, \"That was a tasty burger!\""}
{"text":"Great food! I would give them a 5 on food quality and taste. I gave them a 3 because of their hiring practices. I have a college degree in Hospitality management. The more diverse your staff is culturally the more successful your business will be. They should have employees who are white, black, Asian, Spanish, American Indian, etc. The more diverse the employee pool is the more money they'll be making. I'd say they have a manager who only hires his/her own ethnicity and this is obvious when you step in the door. On 3/14/2018 they had nine employees working and they appeared to all be the same ethnicity. The restaurant will be losing a lot of customers and $$$ if they continue this practice. If your profits doubled you could pay your employees higher wages."}
{"text":"Overall, The Habit is actually a pretty good burger place. The burger seems fresh, is a pretty good size and very reasonably priced. Where else will you find a fully garnished hamburger for only $3? Also they have a great selection of other things like chicken and even a couple of salads that are pretty solid. Really what tops it off though is the fries, sweet fries and onion rings. You just can't go wrong getting any of them here and that's really necessary to make a good burger joint. Also, I have to add, their Coke machine makes some good stuff too. I really kind of dislike the ice at some places, but here they have real solid cubes of ice that produce a very classic soda.

Specifically at this location, they have an above-average layout with outdoor seating and even the staff is always extra friendly here. If you like a burger and fries this is a great place to get it at a reasonable price. It really beats McDonalds, Burger King and Wendys everyday for a similar price point."}
{"text":"Came in here today for the first time. I was immediately greeted by the manager, Mervin!! He ended up ringing up my order and he was so lovely to chat with! Great customer service at this place and the food was EXTRAORDINARY. Definitely will be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"The food speaks for itself, very good stuff. I am a creature of \"Habit\", mostly related to good food and customer service. This place has great food and even better customer service. This starts with the management. I walked up to the line today and when I looked up, there was the District Mgr ready to shake my hand. We hadn't seen each other in 5 years but he made me feel like a VIP customer from the get go. The staff are equally attentive and extremely customer focused. Stop by and ask for Chepe by name. And if he's not around, no worries, you will be well taken care of."}
{"text":"Yes! I'm in Love Love! This is one Fabulous burger spot near the strip in Hughes Center on East Flamingo.

Took a nice afternoon stroll to try it out and I'm more than happy I did!

I'm a burger lover and they make a scrumptious one! The onion rings were good too. I had the Santa Barbara Char with the works and avocado. I spent $8 for a burger, onion rings and a bottled water(I tipped an extra $2 for excellent service).

Very nice clean establishment and employees are super friendly.

I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Well I must say the girls at work rave about the Habit.  We have one by my work and tonight my husband wanted a burger so I thought what the heck let's give it a go.  The place was packed. SRO but people move quickly. Anyway we ordered the Orignal Charburger and the Tri-tip sandwich and fries. My husband loved his burger. He loves the chat flavor so they have that aced. My tri-tip left something to be desired. If you like to deconstruct your food then this is for you. But this had chunks of tri-tip that was literally inedible. I couldn't even chew it. After studying what I had in front of me I figured it out. These are precut chunks and grilled at time of order.   Very disappointed. Fries were over salted. My husband was shaking the salt off. I told him I personally won't be back but for him he said he would because of the char flavor. He'll take that over In and Out any day."}
{"text":"Clean place, average prices for the area. Sadly wasn't very good just basic flavorless burgers salads and chicken sandwich. My kid said his burger was actually \"greasy\"."}
{"text":"Nope. Meat was tasteless. Burger was greasy. 
Texture of the meat was like rubber. Disgusting. 
We ordered 2 cheeseburgers and they were both inedible."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Great Burger look no further. Hot, Fresh & Delicious! Hands down better than In and Out and 5 guys. Great fries and onion rings too! Spotless/clean, made to order with fast & friendly service! My \"go to\" burger place!"}
{"text":"Not good,no it bad just another burger, fries and weak lemonade. Was hoping for a bit better. Not a special tribe place for sure , but if you're hungry it's an acceptable alternative."}
{"text":"My friend loved the grilled chicken on her salad. She thought the lettuce was gritty and unwashed. I had the char burger with cheese. I will grant you I could not have the pepper or garlic they put in it, but the fries were mediocre and the meat looked cheap and tasted cheap. I have gone to red Robin and had their Tavern double which when you add a drink would've only cost me maybe two dollars more than the combo here. At Red Robin I have to do the same thing and ask for no seasoning in the meat other than salt and I enjoy red robins burger."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Had a cheeseburger and tried both the regular fries and sweet potato fries. Burger was dry with very little flavor. Both fries and the shake were average. Nothing worth going back for."}
{"text":"I love this burger joint if you're looking for a large burger and fries at a reasonable price you have to consider here everyone was friendly and my burger was huge gave me -itis lol but was well worth it for $6 bucks"}
{"text":"This a great place to get a great burger at a good price. Better than in n out....i like how they have several options. Their strawberry limeade is really good too."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had in a long time. Plus the prices and beyond reasonable. Will definitely go back to the joint frequently"}
{"text":"The Habit is always great but I always forget to review it.  Today, I was there for lunch and got the chicken sandwich and the fried green beans.  The green beans are great on there own but my wife really enjoys them with the ranch that you can get for dipping. Although I didn't get one today, their burgers are always fantastic also.  Good place for kids -- and to get food to take home.  If you are going to order food to bring home make sure you call your order in advance so that it will be ready when you get there -- it will save you a ton of time!"}
{"text":"Burgers had good flavor,  but the beef patties are thin and overdone.  The tempura green beans were yummy!   You walk up to place your order, sit down,  and go pick up your order when is done.  Reminds me of Burger King, but worth more topping options, sauces, and hot peppers.  Just ok, not sure I would come back."}
{"text":"Onion rings are to die for ! Ive taken my whole family to try these burgers !"}
{"text":"Man, you folks are so lucky you live on the mainland! 

Why?

Well, you folks have so many choices as far as restaurants goes........being that I was born & raised on an island...........I feel the 808 has limited choices sometimes.

One of the joints that we don't have in the 808 is - \"The Habit Burger Grill\". 

The Habit Burger Grill was founded in 1969 in Santa Barbara, CA., and since then, The Habit Burger Grill has expanded all over that state of California with 174 stores. 

Is \"The Habit Burger Grill\" stores outside of California?

Yes, they have Habit Burger Grill's in the following states of - Arizona, Utah, New Jersey, Florida, Nevada, Idaho, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, & Pennsylvania. 

Oversea's? 
They sure do, with (2) stores in the United Arab Emirates, and (2) stores in China.

Total Habit Burger stores? 243 stores my friend............(Thank you Google!).

What can I say about my 1st experience at \"The Habit Burger Grill\", inside the Fashion Show Mall food court in Las Vegas?

The Habit Burger Grill kinda reminds me of In-n-Out Burger...........(we don't have In-n-Out's either in the 808!)

The burgers are reasonably priced, as you can get a Charburger here for just $3.89! Can we say Dealages Yo!!!!

The day we stopped by The Habit Burger Grill, we ended up getting a Charburger ($3.89), a Teriyaki Char ($4.19), & a Veggie Burger ($5.45).

What can I say about the grub?

I ended up getting the Veggie Burger since I don't do red meat..........
Although the Veggie Burger had a large amount of lettuce & tomatoes, but the veggie patty was kinda bland tasting..........worst yet, since I recently had a veggie burger from another major burger joint in the 808, I had something to compare it to, and realized the Veggie Burger at The Habit Burger Grill fell a little short.

As for the Teriyaki Char, & the Charburger? 
Yes, those are great burgers, as my pops & cousin really enjoyed their burgers!

If you're not into red meat like myself, there are other options as I saw they offered several types of chicken sandwiches.

If you don't wanna do a sandwich, they also offer fresh salads. 

Have a sweet tooth? 

The Habit Burger Grill also has shakes, malts, cones, & sundaes too!

I probably just ordered the wrong item............next time I come across a Habit Burger Grill...........I'll do the chicken, & update my review. Lol!"}
{"text":"Wow highly impressed by this burger joint. Everything was excellent. The Ahi Tuna was cooked to perfection and the burgers are sure worth a try. My goodness, this place is just amazing!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place. Second time in within the week. The burgers are great a big step above typical fat food crap. Not greasy or fatty and delicious. I prefer the Santa Barbara style on the toast vs typical hamburger bun. Great toppings. Pepper bar good drink selection and excellent shakes with real ice cream not soft serve. A few different options for fries and onion rings. The place is kept very clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews. I've been three times now and every time the food was amazing. So much better than any other fast food burger (except in&out ofcourse)."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my food (avocado bacon burger) combo with the homemade strawberry cucumber lemonade and the service too, everyone was friendly and happy to assist my kiddo too. Will definitely be returning, should have come here sooner."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch when they were doing a charity event for Three Square. All proceeds went to help feed the hungry here in Nevada. 

Located in the shopping mall near Hash House a Go and Galaxy Golf off Stephanie in Henderson. Very nice sized place, clean and organized. They had quite a few staffers on hand as they were doing training along with providing lunch.

I ordered a double char with bacon (add'l charge), sweet potatoe fries, and a mocha milkshake. Total came to $13 and change. Plenty of food, I barely finished my burger (which promptly led to an afternoon nap) and about 1/2 the fries. Burger quality and taste was delicious. Fries and shake were just ok. 

Service was very good, someone came around and asked if I needed anything a couple times. Employees were friendly and smiling. Talked briefly with the owner and he was a nice guy, happy to do what I learned was their 3rd charity that week, nice way to do a soft open and be a positive influence in the community.

I'll be back for sure. You should go try it as well."}
{"text":"So far so good. If you like a crunch with your burger this is the place. The peach ginger juice is very good. You have to like ginger and peach. I will come back again"}
{"text":"Service? Good! 
BBQ Bacon charburger? Good!
Chocolate Malt? Good!
 
Easiest review I have ever written! Def will be back!"}
{"text":"I love their food! It's always fresh, yummy and doesn't break the bank. I love the strawberry lemonade as well."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. .great pepperoncini and jalapeno bar it's a wonderful place to go for lunch or dinner if you like the taste of charbroiled burgers which I do oh no I don't like them I meant love them"}
{"text":"I wish I could say that we had a chance to try the food. The drive thru got shut down after we waited for 10 minutes. 

Most of the cars left so we went inside - another 16 minutes later, we still had no food. After 26 minutes, I finally just got a refund. They were happy to refund us without any apology. 

Won't waste my time coming back."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at this place, I would have given it 2 or 3 stars.  I got the mushroom swiss burger and fries and was really not impressed.  The next time I got a regular cheeseburger with onion rings and that's what I'm sticking with - really great.  I've also had a couple of sweet potato fries and those were pretty good too.  I like that I can order online and bypass the ridiculously long line and just pick up my food :)"}
{"text":"Was very happy that they started opening up and Arizona. I love that it's charbroiled and not cooked on a grill. they also have onion rings bacon and cheese, plus other menu items. I prefer this over in-n-out burger."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend tried The teriyaki burger, the char burger, sweet potato fries, onion rings, French fries, the vanilla shake, and I had the chocolate malt. Everything was pretty good not too greasy. The only problem was our shakes came out after we were done with the food which sucked but they made it up by giving us a free burger coupon."}
{"text":"The food (s) are So so good here. This is my Second trip to this Habit. The Ladies working here are very nice and you can tell that they all enjoy there Job here.

Mr. JP"}
{"text":"Good value, good food.  I had the Santa Barbara Style Char and was impressed by their sourdough bread.  I liked the fries, too.  Not the best burger ever, but good flavor for the price.  The only reason I like 5 Guys better than this place is that I can get Frank's hot sauce there.  Not as many options here.  But the beef is good and well-cooked, toppings are fresh and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Q:  How did the jury find the hamburger?
A:  Grill-ty as charred!

This beloved California chain that has made its way to Utah, Nevada, and Arizona is amazing.  Mr. Dubs and I came here today when SRP screwed up one thing or another and the whole neighborhood's electricity went out.  Do you know how hard it is to pop in your contacts and do eyeliner in the dark?  It's hard.  But the struggle was well worth it when a delicious charbroiled burger and lovely A/C was there to greet you.

After the lovely server went through the menu with us and gave us some suggestions, we ordered the Teriyaki Char, the #2 Original Double Char meal, and a side of tempura green beans.  Such delicious charry bits of goodness!  Everything was well-seasoned, had good flavor, and tasted great.  I especially loved the tempura green beans with a side of ranch.  It was well worth the extra calories.  Get lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and grilled onions on your burger for no extra charge but cheese is like $0.55 extra and stuff like bacon and avocados are also an extra dime or two.  Don't forget to stop by the swanky chili peppers/pepperchinis/pickles bar and grab yourself a strawberry puree limeade with cucumber slices.  It was a bit sweet for my liking but it was super refreshing on this hot summer day!

All in all, I'll definitely be back here again! Indoor seating is limited as well as parking and since there was a constant flow of customers, the place could end up a bit messy but oh well.  Good food at decent prices!  $20 lunch for two ain't too shabby for a fast food joint with much better quality."}
{"text":"This place is good but not my favorite burgers. I usually get a salad or a chicken burger. I hate how long the drive thru is! We always wait way too long. But other than that the food is worth the price just not worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time here! Burgers were freshly made and very tasty! Buns were toasted and meat was cooked right! Try the tempura green beans and sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"So sad that I've loved this place ever since it opened. I never had issues until today. The drive tru gal was beyond perky and sweet but everything I received was wrong, partially my fault for not checking but she sounded so positive and they're always on top of everything so I didn't check. I asked for avocado on my chicken Cesar salad and she said it was extra I said ok, but I didn't get avocado on it. I also Asked for sweet potato fries for the kids meals and got regular fries on one and the other one the sweet potato fries tasted old and dry, no taste. Again I've never had issues with this place even when they're busy and today I had so many issues and it wasn't as busy. Very disappointed, won't be coming here again. Also I tried to call and and speak to a manager but apparently the complaint department was already closed and it was only 6:30 pm."}
{"text":"So happy Habit is in Vegas. It's by far one of my favorite fast food burger joints. The simple char cheeseburger is quite amazing. The onion rings at this location was the best out of any Habit establishment I've had so far--perfectly fried breading with a nice crunch. The tempura green beans are good, too. 

Char cheeseburger- $3.75    5 stars
Onion rings- 5 stars 
Tempura green bean- 4 stars 
Service- 7 stars. 

And they have a drive-thru. Sweeeeeet."}
{"text":"We were excited that the Habit has finally decided to open a store in Henderson. Food and service is excellent as always. Love the Santa Barbara burger and my daughter loves the grill cheese or chicken tenders here. Always an excellent experience here!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite awhile now and I'm never disappointed. The food always comes out delicious. If you like fish the albacore tuna sandwich tastes amazing. 

Also the staff is always very nice, about a year ago one of the managers went above and beyond and carried my food to my car for me when he saw I was on crutches."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place - the food, prices, atmosphere.

Everything I've ordered has been fresh and delicious. Especially yummy are the burgers and the chicken club sandwich. Oh, and they have the BEST onion rings.

Yum!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome burgers. Perhaps a little salty when I went. But overall great for having a drive through."}
{"text":"Decent burger for the price. However, we waited 25 minutes for a to go order of just 2 regular burgers and fries. I'll be avoiding this place until the newness wears off."}
{"text":"Finally went again and don't see what the big deal is?! Inn-n-out is hands down better..."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this paradise and flamingo location as it is close, cute and cozy inside. They have good food and super reasonable prices!

They have burgers, salads, shakes, fries, onion rings, so many good side options.

They also have many club email promotions for member sign up. I just redeemed a free Char burger incentive they emailed me!

I am hooked on the Veggie burger which is very good! However on one of my previous visits I did have a small complaint. My Veggie burger was dry, not enough of the dressing that they put on it. The sandwich is big with a big wheat bun, it needs the sauce! So on my next visit I requested to the location Manager that he please make a note for them to add extra sauce to my veggie burger. I very quietly informed him that I was disappointed in my last visit with my dry veggie burger. He said \"Ok\" and \"Sorry\" and that was that. I took my veggie burger to go, no extra sauce, in fact I think they put less than normal :/. I will just ask that they pack it on the side next time to make sure I don't end up with a dry veggie burger AGAIN.

They have really good sides and milkshakes."}
{"text":"One of the best burger spots out there. The burger was charbroiled to perfection (not over-done), the fries are fresh and lightly salted and the home-made strawberry limeade is one of the best soft drinks you could find anywhere. Will be back, again and again and again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the freshest food with the most flavorful burgers.  I highly recommend Habit should you need a quick bite to eat thats well worth every penny.  The Staff is incredible and always smiling."}
{"text":"Sitting having to listen to very loud lady behind counter too Damm loud left with a head ache manager I do not a nane short heavy set Hispanic female wearing a bun."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was my 1st time EVER to a Habit, and it didn't disappoint! The food was amazing, the restaurant was spotless and the staff was AWESOME! I took my 94 yr old Grandma there for lunch...she said it's one of the best burgers she's ever had and I agree! The staff was so friendly, helpful and kind! They gave the type of service you'd expect in a gourmet restaurant! Special shout-out to the manager Ramiro, Arlene, and Evelyn. They went above and beyond to make it special for Grandma! Thank you so much! We will be back tomorrow!! :)"}
{"text":"Our first time.  Awesome burgers and fries. Both were very fresh and hot. Loved the grilled onions."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick bite to eat but didn't want fast food and this place did the trick. Nicest people in the world behind the counter and my burger was excellent along with the onion rings. Great meal for $10"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Overpriced burger joint. I tried the Chicken sandwich and the different burgers and I rather have Burger King."}
{"text":"Ate here with my family this evening. The food is very good and the price is right. A very cozy and relaxed place to eat a really good burger. Not as cheap as some fast food joints but definitely worth the extra$$. Will definitely return. Thanks"}
{"text":"We ate there on 6/3/18 and loved it!  The burgers were great and the fries were crispy. I had the avocado burger on sourdough and he had the double char burger. Again it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my son, had eaten on the one on the west side of town.. My son had the burger it was delicious.. Cooked perfect. I had the Cobb Salad it was wonderful .. The chicken grill..the lettuce chopped.. Very fresh .. The place very clean.. The staff friendly and very helpful.. I will return.."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite burger place! It's a simple concept: just good, fresh ingredients, made to order. They just simply taste better than any other quick serve burger place ( yes, even In-n-Out has been bumped to # 2 spot). Yes, there's no drive thru, but I think it's worth going inside and having a real, freshly made burger. The staff has been friendly and professional at the 3 locations I've been to ( especially the Paradise Valley Mall adjacent one). Love this place!"}
{"text":"I just got a BBQ beacon burger, the meat and the bun are cold , and also the chicken burger , the bun was cold as well ! It's very disappointing!  It happened to me before , so no more !"}
{"text":"they have a pepper bar!!!! with jalapeño slices, pepperchinis, and baby peppers! this alone is totally worth coming here. the service was great, staff were super friendly and asked how the food was and came by to throw away our trash. teriyaki burger was delish and tender and flavorful! their fries weren't greasy and they were plump and crispy. I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"We were extremely surprised when we stopped  here for dinner. It was a really good fast casual burger place and something different from the usual burger joints."}
{"text":"First time trying The Habit. Autumn the cashier immediately greeted me when I walked in. Great job. She was very friendly and helpful. I was here just after lunch and the place was pretty busy. Wait time on the food was about 8 minutes which is not bad. I had a BBQ cheese burger and onion rings along with a chocolate shake. Food looked great but was disappointed as nothing was very hot. Food tasted good, but unfortunate the temp was not up to par. Probably my biggest observation was the amount of managers/owner who were in the building and yet not a single one of them interacted with any of their guests. I was here for 45 min and as a matter of fact, 4-5 of them sat directly in front of me and never made eye contact or said a word to me. They are also close to the exit and never once said thank you or anything to people leaving. Leaders lead by example and the leaders showing a non-caring attitude to the guests will ultimately lead to the crew doing the same. Nice place, food was good I just hope the managers step up their game."}
{"text":"Wow...This was a damn good burger!
Staff was very nice,place was spotless.
I will be back!"}
{"text":"For a quick meal, I have never been dissapointed here. The menu is simple and has the typical burger options but also features a few surprises like fresh tuna steak and tempura green beans. The service needs for a 'fast food' setup are minimal and yet everyone who works here somehow goes a little beyond what is needed: the area is constantly being cleaned, trays rounded up from tables, a quick 'how was everything', and the orders are almost never wrong."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I got the bbq bacon char and it was delicious! The workers are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Literally, the best little burger stop you can find other than in n out. High quality burgers. Thick shakes. Crispy fries. It doesn't get any better. Oh wait, it does. Because the service might actually be one of the best for a fast food place. They're always welcoming when you first walk in and helpful from the minute you order til when you leave. They check up on you during your meal and even get you to go boxes and bags. I like the fact that they have a condiment bar with different toppings for your meal. And they really do become a dang habit. A delicious habit."}
{"text":"Charburger on a sourdough bread? YES PLEASE! This burger joint is fresh and new on Stephanie. I was super excited to eat here so we decided to try it out. My boyfriend got the number two and I got the number one. The difference is how many patties you get. The meal comes with fries and a drink. The fries are super crispy and delicious! They have a condiment bar with peppers, jalepenos, and other toppings. Their menu has a variety of things-- salads, chicken, dessert. And to top it all off their customer service is superb for a little fast food joint. They don't treat it that way and I hope they keep it that way. Greetings when you walk in and out, people asking if you're okay at your table, even taking trays away for you and your trash. Definitely a 5 star place if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Soooo... I try to not make it a HABIT to overspend on anything so I will not be back to this place. 

Good food. BUt.. just that. Good. Not like anything special. Just good. This is a burger joint that for some reason things they are SUUUPER special and can charge 30% more than In-n-out across the street. 

Gourmet? NO. 
Good Value? NO.
Good food. YES. 
Will I go back? NO. 
Would I recommend? NO.

The 1 star is for the terrible value of this place. I really cannot see why this place is busy at all."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good, it gets better and better as you eat it. The burgers seem plain and not very imaginative at first. The fries look like nothing special. The salads use iceberg lettuce. So what's the big deal? Well, everything seems fresh and crispy. The fries are light but have been fried to crispy gold colored sticks of potato. The Santa Barbara Cobb salad has bacon, egg, blue cheese, tomato and avocado with a light dressing. That's just a descriptor. Ok, it's made well. Even the hamburger we seems built and not slapped together. It's simple, flavorful, and looks good. Service was great."}
{"text":"Just had a Charburger at the Habit Burger Grill. It blew my mind... Not the burger, though I wish it did. No, the fact that I went to UC Santa Barbara for college, lived in Goleta where the first Habit location was founded and today is my first time having one of their menu item! 

Did that Goleta location shut down while I was there?  I have no idea. What I do know is that the Charbrburger is just alright. Better quality and fresher ingredients compared to McDonald's, but the burger just didn't wow me. Maybe I needed that Fry Sauce I read about in other reviews.

The Strawberry Limeade is good though. Very sweet, so I had to water it down, but I liked it better as a sugary drink over the Charburger vs say a Single with Cheese Animal Style.

Suggestion: avoid the lunch crowd, especially during the summer and the outside temperature is in the low 100s, because that's where you will have to sit and eat if you can't fight for one of the coveted indoor seating spaces.

Carpool if you can too, because Panera has crazy lunch crowds too and the parking lot is also shared with Chipotle, Jamba Juice & Pieology. 

The clear winner? The owner of this strip mall of course!"}
{"text":"I really like Habit Burger.  I haven't tried everything yet, but am looking forward to it!  The burger is really good, and surprisingly the veggie burger is great!  I'm usually not a fan of veggie burgers.  Fries are good - but give the tempera green beans a try - so good!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, I especially like the grilled onions! The kids size are a decent size (honestly big enough for an adult)."}
{"text":"Now this is what I call a burger! big juicy and meaty, doesnt have that awful after taste of the meat lik other places
Good solid menu,burgers are bomb, onion rings are juicy and not greasy,malts are delicious.  Free ranch!! 
It gets super busy
this place is not good for kids this place gets busy and not alot of seating areas"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have had in a very long time.  If you are craving a good burger, you have got to try this place!!"}
{"text":"Sad to see this place suck after some good times but it was a slow Thursday and it took a long time for my burgers but my first world annoyance was that the fries, tampura and shake was sitting out so long that they were cold and melted.  When they are busy and quick you get an apology but the ladies tonight gave no cares.  Plus shouldn't you wash your hands after cleaning even if you are putting my cold fries and green beans in the bag?"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the huge Habit burgers.  Not sure if it is the mayo or that they are all really sloppy wet.  The taste is OK but eating them can be a challenge.  I do like the fries - both regular and sweet potato.  They are very good.  I also like the use of Coke products.  So, when I go and special order like no mayo or such - anything to keep liquid off it! - it becomes kind of a major ordeal there.  Almost not worth it and just suffer through a soggy sandwich.  They will do in a pinch but they are not one of my favorite burger joints."}
{"text":"Looks like HBG has joined the league of cheap a$$ burger joints.  So its only fair that  I rate their burger and fries to the league leaders *cough* ahem: In-N-Out and FIVE Guys 

Right off the bat, their patties were just a bit on the FIRMer side.  Not sure about you but I prefer my burger a little softer.  To be honest, tasted similar to what you can make at home or store bought.  The fresh veggies, grilled onions and buns were nothing extraordinary.  

The fries were also nothing to write home about.  Mediocre at its finest.  Nothing about it stood out.  

The couple of things that I did like were their lttle bar that had unlimited amounts of pickled chilis (like In-N-Out), peperoncinis, and jalepenos.  Along with bottles of A1 Sauce, Worcestershire, Tapatio, and Tabasco.   

When it comes to pricing and burgers, In-N-Out takes the GOLD, while the victor goes to FIVE GUYS for their puffy, potato tasting fries.  Sorry HBG, you get the consolation prize."}
{"text":"Drove to the Habit last night on Saturday, it says they're open till 12 online and at their sign. However I got there at 11:30 exactly, except the employees like to close 30 minutes early, so don't expect their hours to match what they have advertised at this location."}
{"text":"I am surprisingly  pleased with this place i'm a big fan of Burgerville in Portland Oregon and I compare all of my experiences with that one. It's top shelf. so continuing on I had a veggie burger and ahi  tuna and  tempura battered green beans I don't know if it was organic or locally harvested but I did not care it was awesome"}
{"text":"Excellent food,  excellent service!  Mushroom Char in a lettuce wrap!!! Not a single complaint about this place.  The food is fresh and delicious and the service, especially from the young man with the dark hair cleaning up around the seating area, is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I had to stop in here after eating at a Habit in Utah and loved it there.  This one didn't disappoint either! ! Their customer service is excellent and my char burger in a lettuce wrap with fries was awesome!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Habit! Great if you're looking for more options than In-N-Out (such as delicious onion rings). Food always tastes great and the service is excellent. Also an option if you don't plan on drinking and don't want/need the whole sit-down experience"}
{"text":"Grilled chicken on sourdough swoon. I love all of their food. And it's a late night drive thru. Lots of healthy options."}
{"text":"Great service!!!! The burger was amazing and the staff was friendly. I ordered the double char burger and it was cooked perfectly. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The Burgers taste pretty decent but I'm disappointed that they only offer American cheese on their burgers. I thought this is considered a higher-quality burger joint so the lack of cheddar or other cheeses is disappointing. Their onion rings and chicken sandwich are nothing special.

I had looked at their nutritional information to see if there were any other options and was appalled at how much sodium is in their food. I know fast food in general isn't healthy but I don't know if I've ever seen numbers this high. Their food doesn't taste particularly salty but sodium levels this high is dangerous and I sent a complaint to corporate through their website.

In regards to the location at 7th Avenue and McDowell Rd, the dining room is way too cold and perhaps that's to keep people from loitering but I try to eat and leave and I shouldn't feel like I'm going to get hypothermia by being there for 20 minutes.

I won't be eating here anymore."}
{"text":"At the end of the day food comes down to quality and price.

So I had what ever they call a double burger, fries and a soda.  Came to $8.50 tax included.

So a couple immediate observations...

About price.  I can get the same meal at In and Out for at least $2 cheaper.  I can get a far larger burger at Fudruckers for the same price.

So now about quality.  For less money the In and Out burger is far better quality.  For the same amount of money the Fudruckers is far better quality.

None of the above is to say that the burger here was bad.  Rather, you can get better quality for less or the same elsewhere.  The only thing unique here is how they cook the hamburger.  But it isn't worth the extra $$ over In and Out and doesn't even approach the higher quality bar set by Fudruckers for the same price.

So at the end of the day I'm left trying to figure out what's the big deal is about this place.  Beats the heck out of me."}
{"text":"This place was good but it definitely doesn't have the \"best tasting burger in America\" as they claim on their drink cups. Ordered the superfood salad which was a generous portion but I didn't love the salad dressing it came with so I ordered a side of balsamic vinaigrette. The double char cheeseburger was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the fries. They didn't have much seasoning and were just kind of thick and bland. 

To me, this place has an upgraded fast food vibe to it. Which is fine if you go in expecting it. You can see the cooks throw the frozen burger patties onto the grill in front of you so you kind of know what you're getting. I did really enjoy their special house lemonade because it had fresh fruit and cucumber floating in it that provided a nice flavor. It did need to be poured over ice because I originally tasted it straight from the serving jug and it was lukewarm. 

Overall, descent food but not anywhere I am dying to run back to."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers and fries! 
I appreciate a good burger, and this place doesn't disappoint. I usually get the double char with cheese, always good. I hear the shakes and malts are good, but I try not to over do it haha. The food is all cooked to order so the fries and burgers are always fresh. The ranch here is so good, so that's a plus for me.
The employees are all pleasant and very nice. I always feel welcome when I'm here. 
It's always nice to eat where the employees are all nice. 
Definitely a good burger place to come to!"}
{"text":"I came here with my co-workers and have always wanted to try this place out.  With so many hamburger shops opening up every where, I was a little leery if this was as great as I have heard.  After ordering at the counter, we received a pager that would go off once our food was ready.  They have a \"chili\" bar with all kinds of different chili/peppers along with your normal ketchup and mustard pump stations.  I ordered their regular hamburger meal that came with fries and a drink which was $6.99 plus tax.  I was impressed!  The fries were hot and crunchy and perfectly cooked.  Hamburger wasn't out of this world, but was tasty.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"Not the best not the worst. Average and okay but nothing to die for."}
{"text":"I've never been to The Habit before. I ordered the Santa Barbara combo and was not disappointed. I sat at the high top and dined in on a busy lunch time on Saturday. My order came in a very reasonable amount of time. Everything tasted very fresh and quality ingredients at the price point. The staff was very courteous as well and bussed my tray just as they saw me leaving. I will absolutely return as a routine customer."}
{"text":"This is by far THE WORST customer service experience I've had at a restaurant. Our order was taken correctly, good job order taker. We had 4 meals. We got our food and had three things wrong with our meals. Okay, no big deal, we went up to have them corrected. One was a burger that was supposed to be and yes paid for, a double. The girl with top braces and a light blue shirt on, Judy was there she took it dramatically threw it away and said \"yeah right, I gave you a double\". I was taken back! Why would I lie? And why would she accuse a customer. When I went back up to get the new one, I calmly told her, you know, we had three mistakes and you didn't care to listen, you didn't apologize you accused us of lying. The manager Judy should be ashamed of herself. She started walking away while I was mid sentence like she didn't need to hear a concern. I was like, are you the manager? She said they have a lot more customers that are happy with the habit and the service. And didn't care about what happened with us. She just kept saying, you'll be back no matter what we do. This is a person in charge? Way to set the example Judy. I'm sure the habit can find better."}
{"text":"Several people have recommended this place to me. I thought it would just be another burger place. I was wrong. I like a lettuce wrap burger and theirs was a treat. Juicy, taste, fixed he way I like. 
The times we have been there are late afternoon. Seating inside has been crowded but thee is outdoor seating and with the cooler afternoons this is preferred over inside.
Everyone has been very nice and helpful. Even at the end of the day the place appears to be well kept. 
Another reason to visit is the price of their burger. Very competitively priced. I believe less than most of the chain burger shops. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We went there saturday for lunch and ordered a cheeseburger and fries to go. We ate this at home and when we finished our stomach was not feeling all well. I gave a piece to my dog and since then he has had diarrhea ever since. For us adults we haven't really been able to eat anything because our stomach can't tolerate it. Will never go to this place again!"}
{"text":"*Insert 1000 heart eye emoji's here* 
I LOVE THIS PLACE! 
My boyfriend and his family have raved about how good this place was and I had to try it, because a lot of you Reno yelpers know that I love me a burger! So when in Rome (Vegas), I eat! 
Their menu is to the point and easy to read. I got the charburger with cheese, fries and a chocolate shake. It only took about 8-10 minutes for us to get our food (LOVE! Know they cooked it fresh). The burger was delicious, I literally ate it in 5 minutes max. It was juicy and had a great flavor! 
The fries were just okay, but I don't like super potato-ey fries (prefer em crispy) but that's okay! That's a personal thing, can't knock them for that!
The shake was to die for. I usually can't finish a shake no matter how good it was and this one was emptied by the time we left! 
It was also really cool that a worker came up to us and asked us if she could fill up any of our drinks or throw any of our trash away! For a fast food place to have their employees do that felt really personal! I love it here! Now just to get them to open one in Reno..."}
{"text":"My son insisted we try this place and it was good. The burgers an fries were delicious and we will be back again. My advice would be to stay away from the ginger infused drink they have, way way too much ginger that burns your mouth and totally dominates your taste buds. There is supposed to be a hint of ginger not complete ginger juice..... Other than that once i got a new cup and got a regular drink all was good."}
{"text":"Very reasonable burger and fresh ingredients. Ate at a different location before and was not to impressed. This location was much better. Not gourmet burger level but better to compare with in n out and 5 guys"}
{"text":"Newer location across the street from Paradise Valley Mall.

Always clean and good service with very good prices.

The food is always fresh and served hot. I generally order the #1 Burger Combo with French Fries and a drink which is plenty of food. 

The burger is very fresh and I have them serve it with the works.

I like the self serve soda fountain so you can get refills.

I like the char flavor of the burger and each time I come here I enjoy  th we food more and more.

I think I like the flavor a little more than In N Out burgers and seems like the quality is a bit better.

I will come back when I am in the area and have a craving for a burger.

Good job to Habit Burger and will see you very soon."}
{"text":"Occasionally I crave a good burger and this is one of the places I head. I had the specialty spicy bacon blue burger, which had a chipotle mayo, jalapenos, blue cheese and bacon. The burger was awesome. Cooked perfectly. I just wish they were larger. There're so small all of the time that it makes me sad. While they're tasty, they were not much larger than silver dollar pancackes. The sweet potato fries were almost two dollars while normal potato fries were half that price. Enjoy a vanilla malt with your meal then go buy some beer at BevMo to take home."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru at the California location and I was not too happy.  I am not sure if there was a new person working the drive-thru, but the wait took forever (it seemed).  There were only two cars in front of me and we waited and waited and waited.  Finally things were moving.  The service was good, but not EXCELLENT.  I would not recommend going through drive-thru if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Its about time I can have Habit while in Vegas since it has always been my favorite burger from Cali. It must have been a grand opening promotion because I got a free burger and it was delish! Considering they just opened everything seemed to flow well and the staff seemed well trained already so that was nice. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"For starters, I very much like Habit... in Tempe, Long Beach, Santa Barbara, LA.... but the Gilbert location is an absolute dumpster fire that couldn't even piss itself out.

The specific issues I have with this location all come back to extremely poor management.  I happen to know the food at Habit can be good, I've had it at other locations that are properly managed where it is actually good.

My most recent trip here was just last week.  We had taken a few months off from the last time since I became violently ill after being fed a fried chicken sandwich by this Habit location which was cooked while still in its packaging material.  That experience was more \"criminally negligent\" than delicious or fun, but let's focus on the latest incident...

Two of us went to Habit to eat.  As we are ordering everything seems fine at first, but I made a request to make sure my chicken sandwich had pickles that sent the poor child at the register into overload.  I figured I'd have to sort this out later, and no I didn't ask them to make sure to take it out of the package first (I knew I was going to check for that).  

So, food comes.  Overcooked fries aren't a surprise (tip to management, train your employees to have some damned respect for customers and when they order a small fry if you only have one size just key the damned thing in instead of correcting your customer \"we only have one size\" and staring blankly at them waiting for them to say \"is like your only size of fries.\"  Clearly someone shouldn't be managing such a complex team of customer facing individuals if we can't get the register experience even close to correct...).  No pickles, no shock there.  

My partners food shows up.  He specifically stated no mayonnaise.  The receipt even echoed this.  The sandwich shows up with mayo, again to no ones surprise.  What happens next is truly appalling:  he takes the sandwich to the counter.  The person at the counter then hands the sandwich to the manager to inspect it.  The manager, wearing the same gloves he was using to hold the mop, rummages through the burger and decides there's no mayo... then returns it.  This nasty, rummaged through burger is RETURNED to the customer.  With attitude, he sits it on the counter and says there is no mayo (just, apparently, added bacteria and filth from his hands).  Only, there was mayo... still on the now worn out burger that's in pieces in the basket.  It was absolutely stunning that the manager of the restaurant would treat a customer like this by not taking thier word and remaking the order, and that they would take the food back out to them looking like this...

Here's where things are dangerous for you, horrible manager:  you simply cannot be wrong if you're going to do this, and it still had mayo.  What in the world is wrong with you that would possess you to do this?! No apology, and this loser didn't even bring the corrected food out with an apology... he had someone else do it, because apparently the only time he can pretend to have a spine is when he thinks the customer is wrong.  This was a disgusting display of gross incompetence, and it wasn't the first time either.  

The assistant manager was apologetic, probably has tons of practice since his boss is so offensively bad at his job time after time.  Again, this was not an isolated case.

Oh and thanks for the free burger coupons, I gave them to the homeless guy on the corner. It's my sincere hope that he locks himself in your restroom for a full body bathing experience.

Update:  I think it's funny that the \"manager\" reaches out to others on here as noted but has done nothing to make my situation right.  And by funny, I mean a pathetic display of incompetence."}
{"text":"My family and I have gone to this restaurant since it's opening and I'm so happy that every time we go the restaurant is very clean everyone is very friendly and we always get exactly what we order with no issues.  The food is always fresh the salads taste amazing, we love it.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"These burgers are amazing. I seriously never wish for In and Out anymore  (and that's saying something).

The Portabella and Teriyaki burgers are flavor heavens.

I've had all of their side dishes and side salads and I would recommend them all. The tempura fried green beans are a must."}
{"text":"Took my family here for dinner.  The hamburgers were really good.  I had the regular charburger, and i liked it quite a bit.  It was better than most of the fast food chains, but I'd rank it below the higher end burgers from places like Fuddruckers or Red Robin.   For the price though, I was very satisfied.  My 8 year old really liked her charburger with cheese, but my other daughters did not like the grilled cheese at all.  I was not impressed by either the regular or sweet potato fries, but the onion rings were good.  We did not get any dessert, although the sundaes and milk shakes looked really appealing.  We'll try those next time."}
{"text":"We won't be making this place a habit!  This was the first time we ate here and probably the last.  There is nothing special about this place. Burgers were a bit dry and had no seasoning, fries were fine. Girl at the register was clueless. I ordered the #1 which comes with fries and a drink and then she asked if I would like fries and a drink. It took her 3 tries to get my husband's order right and it was just the #2 plain. Burgers are better quality than MickeyD's but not by much. Save your money and try somewhere else. Menu also seemed pretty limited. Not worth it for $9"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp & decided to try it after reading the reviews.  After a long flight...we were starving & this place definitely lived up to its rating. My fiance & I loved the strawberry lemonade & peach & ginger drink! Would definitely recommend & visit again!"}
{"text":"Had the veggie burger this evening.....I met a friend here the other day and that's what she had; I had already eaten, but her food looked (and *smelled*) soooo good, that I just had to come back and try it for myself. It was worth coming back! 

All of the food was very fresh, including the fries. (you can tell fries have been fried in dirty oil by their color....if they are very dark in color, you know the oil is old!) The fries were nice and a light golden color and perfectly salted. My husband was very surprised at his burger choice, very good he said, and he was happy they put pickles on their burgers (I wonder why in-n-out doesn't do that......?) My burger came with cucumbers and alfalfa sprouts and onions, plus I was able to get it on a whole wheat bun. It's a good \"burger\" choice for a health freak like me :)

And the whole order came to 10 bucks!! We were very pleasently surprised!! Good burgers for a good price with fast service. Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! I tired both the BBQ Burger and Chicken sandwich and I was blown away by the quality of their meat! It was fresh never frozen meat that was actually cooked deliciously on the grill. The buyers a pretty big and man those sweat potato fries are a must to try! I love this place and will definitely continue to come back because of the quality. I recommend their hand made juices! Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there today a little before noon. Place was clean and had a lot of customers. Menu is very simple to read and line went fairly quick. I ordered the original burger meal. They give you a buzzer  to notify you once you're food is ready. It's like any other burger joint and I wouldn't say the food is bad or spectacular. The reason for the 3 stars is the service. The person who took my order was being rude and the day had barely started. Tried to be cheerful with her and she was not having it. She was speaking fast and I couldn't understand what she asked and asked her what she said. She responded with an attitude in her tone. My friends said the same thing about their behavior. What separates this place from good burger places? The SERVICE! The Manager was behind the cashiers and didn't seem to mind their behavior. Go to In and Out down the street. You know what you're getting with service and smile."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away on blue diamond in the Albertsons shopping center. I actually drive by this place a lot and decided to come try it. 

When you walk in the menu is on the wall you order like any fast food place. They were not super busy, but there were many workers that we could see. I tried the teriyaki burger with pineapple and green bean fries. 

The service was okay and the food was good, but not super great. I enjoyed the green bean fries more than the burger. 

Overall, I would come and try other things on their menu. Their service could improve though. We walked in and were not greeted right away and noticed the workers were busy talking amongst themselves instead of addressing the customers in the lobby."}
