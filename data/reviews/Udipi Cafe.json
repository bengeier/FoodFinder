{"text":"We stumbled upon Udipi while traveling across Pennsylvania on a holiday. We couldn't have been more happy to have found an Indian restaurant not far from our path. We were concerned as we neared the location that the map might have been off as the building is set in a very unsuspecting location. The food was absolutely delicious! Both of our dishes were surprisingly spicy since they didn't ask about spice level when we ordered ahead by phone. We both like spicy food so it was perfect for us, but those who are sensitive to spicy foods might ask for their food to be mild. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Best South Indian fare I've had in any city. Worth driving way out there. I promise. The dosas are awesome. So awesome that I haven't tried any other entrees on the menu. I think my favorite is the paper masala dosa, but the special rava is a close second. I also LOVE their rasmaiai - cardamom/pistachio flavored milky goodness. If you don't like cardamom, I'd give this one a miss as the flavor is pretty strong. The idli is also top notch. 

I'd say this is one of Pittsburgh's hidden gems. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"The best masala dosa and bhaatura you can find in town! 
Don't get scared by the looks of the place, you have to try their food! 
The place is clean but very beat up I have to say! 
The most authentic South Indian place I have been to! 
Highly recommend it! 
I have been going there for 4 years now!"}
{"text":"Udipi is exactly what you want in a Cafe.  Excellent Southern Indian food, and an atmosphere that makes everyone feel welcome.  Although the management feels compelled to offer some Northern Indian dishes, STAY AWAY!  Those dishes are average at best, and might even offend folks from Northern India.  I'm a gringo, but I went with a bunch of friends from both Northern and Southern India, so there were educated, critical pallets at the table. 

The restaurant was very busy, and almost everyone in there was either a native of India or first generation American.  In my mind, that's evidence of good things to come.  The dishes were all delicious - we ate a wide range of the Southern Indian offerings.  A couple of the members of our group did order Northern Indian fare, so we did get to find out how mediocre it was.

GO THERE!  Eat Southern Indian cuisine and feel fortunate that such excellent cuisine is available in the Pittsburgh area!  I'm keen to go back, as well as to get my fill of good Northern Indian cuisine at The People's Restaurant, also in Pittsburgh.  

It's all good . . ."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian South Indian food in Pittsburgh.

Not the best South Indian I've ever had. For that I would suggest that you travel to New York and eat at Saravana Bhavan on Lexington Avenue.

If you are in Monroeville/Pittsburgh area though, Udipi can't be beat. We ordered the rasam soup, the appetizer plate, Mysore rava masala dosa and the mixed vegetable uttappam. Since I have a rule not to order North Indian fare in South Indian restaurants (and vice versa), I requested the server to substitute the samosa on the appetizer plate with something else, and he suggested the bonda.

The appetizer platter was HUGE. The idli, vada and bondas were excellent. The pakodas were alright, but hubby loved the fact that they had whole chilli pepper pakodas. The chutneys (green cilantro-sour, brown tamarind-sweet, coconut-savory) were all fresh and really, really good.

The dosa was decent, a near-perfect 8 out of 10 on the thinness-and-crispness scale. The onion-potato stuffing was good. 
The sambar, very sambar-ey-salty, sour, hot. 
Rasam soup- good, but hard to distinguish from the sambar.

We had to ask them to bag the uttappam for us, which they did with a smile. We had it for breakfast next morning, and it was perfect.

In all, Udipi is up there on my list of South Indian restaurants. They do have quite a bit of North Indian fare on the menu too, though I can't comment on that. Diner-room ambience, restrooms are bare but clean. We would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The food was great at this restaurant. We come here all the time, with the fam, and we always love it. The place looks run down but the food makes up for it. 

The service was quick and the whole meal took about 45 mins. It was a great time."}
{"text":"Best South Indian food we had in Pittsburgh, PA. Worth the wait. Masala Dosa was the best with Mango Lassi. They don't serve alcohol but you can bring your own."}
{"text":"I so much love this place. it has the best dosa in pittsburgh! I go there every week and not even once they have screwed up on any order. 
The service is very fast and food is delicious.."}
{"text":"t serves one of the worst south Indian food in USA. It used to be good few years ago but now it has become really bad both in quality of food and service. 

One can smell the stink from the restrooms as one enters the restaurant. Yes, it literally stinks.  The place has poor hygiene standards and the food inspectors should really pay a visit here and place a hefty fine / shut down the place. 

The vadas feel like they have been re-fried 10 times and are about 10 days old.  Dosas are full of soda bicarb and leave a horrible aftertaste. The potatoes inside were stale. The place is badly in need of renovation. 

Orders are often messed up and the waiters are \"ruthless\" as they literally throw the food on the table. They are unclean. If you get a peep into the kitchen behind the cash counter, I assure you you will never reenter just as like we wont ever go back. 

There are better Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Udipi Cafe has ruined my life.  My friends all hate me because I can't stop talking about how Udipi's food is the most delicious in America, I'm broke because I can't stop driving out to Monroeville and spending my last pennies on dinner there, and I can't sleep at night because I just need more Udipi Cafe.  Seriously, though, I'm barely hyperbolizing.  Western Pennsylvania should feel honored to host some of the best Indian food around.  The mayor of Monroeville (who's that?) should pay Udipi in thanks for being the only place of interest in the city.

And did I mention?  All vegetarian!  Authentic!  Perfectly spiced!  Cheap!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Authentic south Indian food. Really good dosas and other \"tiffins\""}
{"text":"It's certainly not about the atmosphere, but the food here sure is terrific. The wait staff is friendly, the crowd low key, and the meal is wonderful."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant on memorial day weekend. There are huge crowds at the near by SV temple and it reflected in this restaurant as well.

We got the table without much wait but it took more than 20 minutes for the waiter to show up to take order. My kid is already very hungry and getting impatient. But our order items came relatively very fast. The items are very delicious and came in generous proportions.

We will definitely visit this restaurant again but NOT on a long weekend."}
{"text":"Though at first I was reluctant to drive all the way to the middle of nowhere for a meal, I will now very enthusiastically make the hike and evangelize to any of my friends who will listen to me of the tastiness of Udipi. Every time I make the trip I try to shove as many people as I can into my car and force feed them items off the menu, but I have yet to hear a single complaint. The food is very impressive to both the eyes and mouth. My favorite item on the menu, batura comes out steaming twice the size of my head and every time I burn myself trying to take a nibble immediately. The dosas are also a force to be reckoned with for they're a good 1.5 feet in length and again absolutely delicious. I've left Udipi so many times with the best feeling in my belly and I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Mouth watering, satisfying south indian food, leaves you craving to come back.
Personally liked idli, vada, dosa and uttapam the most.  Gobi manchurian and channa batura were average. The pesaratu tasted great but was a bit greasy."}
{"text":"Great food! Best dosas hands down! Don't underestimate the place by the looks, they concentrate on the food!"}
{"text":"Very good indian food and prices are very fair and total awesome taste."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time it was awesome. Came again with high expectations. This time ordered Andhara Masala dosa, but they used hot chilli garlic sauce instead of Andhara chutney. They did admit this is what they sell but kind enough to replace it. Then I ordered coffee which was so bitter. I am not sure if I will come here again but if I will, I will never order anything with so called Andhara chutney."}
{"text":"Another drive, but well worth it.  

Udipi Cafe is a small vegetarian Indian restaurant in Monroeville. It is a really simple place with a few booths and a few tables, so it doesn't impress visually.  The food is Southern Indian, so they do great dosas.  

 And you can try many things as it is quite cheap."}
{"text":"Very good South Indian food. The dosa and idli sambhar are the best. Very delicious and authentic. 
3 stars and not 5 because other dishes on the menu except for South Indian not great. We ordered Chana bhatura which was average in taste and flavor. Ambience is not great as well. The interior was too hot and crowded. The tables are very close to each other. Service is average as well. In Spite of these the food makes up for it.
I recommend this place to all authentic SouthIndian food lovers."}
{"text":"Authentic and affordable South Indian food that is absolutely amazing. Highly recommend the Idli as an appetizer (mainly for the coconut chutney that comes with it.. I ate the entire cup with a spoon)."}
{"text":"Worst service.. Felt ashamed as Indian for the first time because of the staffs. They neither have manners nor have courtesy to deal with customers. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Kind of out there to find, but really good vegetarian South Indian food.  And cheap, did I mention cheap?"}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine.  For about $15, I had enough food to feed two people.

They were very friendly, and even gave me extra condiments.

You will need a car to get to this place, as it's out off the freeway, far away from the center of Pittsburgh.  However, it's a top Indian food place (and I have been to a lot of them)."}
{"text":"I've never really liked Indian food until I ate here.  This food is off the chain.  The Samosa is wonderful, the Coconut chutney is lovely, and the vegetable curry is awesome!  They give you plenty of food, and it won't kill your wallet.

We've been in town for one week and eaten there 3 times already, with plans to go back.  It's addictive!  Lots of Vegan options!  The place is somewhat of a dive, but it's clean enough for the workers to eat there, so I'm good with that.

Very Nice staff, helpful for those that aren't familiar with indian cuisine.
Lots of loud conversation and foreign languages mixing with pleasant indian music.  Even though the atmosphere isn't top notch, it's a neat little cubby of culture, and I would recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY VEGANs!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here. The sambhar was ok but could have been less watery. Idli and wada were delicious. I ordered the spicy Andhra dosa which should have been spicy as I had asked for it but wasn't. My friend ordered rawa masala dosa, which wasn't that great either. the service was slow and sometimes rude."}
{"text":"Food: Udipi is 100% vegetarian South Indian cuisine.  The menu is huge with plenty of appetizers, dosas, soups, entrees, and desserts to choose from.  We ordered the \"Royal appetizer platter\" which gives a sampling of all of their appetizers.  For $7 it was easily enough to feed 4 people and give everyone multiple tastes of each appetizer.  The dosas are huge.  We ordered one to share among two people as a second appetizer (we were hungry); one person at our table ordered one as his meal.  The entrees, again, are huge and delicious.  You can request how spicy you would like the meal made.  The baseline spiciness is very tame and shouldn't upset even the most sensitive palate.  Surprisingly, Udipi does not have naan or vindaloo on the menu, two of my favorites, but I am not very knowledgeable about the different regional cuisines of India, which may explain this.  It didn't matter remotely, however, as every meal was fantastic.  I highly recommend the Channa Batura, which the menu describes as a \"large puffy bread\" and it is in fact at least the size of a watermelon when it comes to your plate.  Luckily, for my waistline, it is mostly full of air and deflates, but was more than enough to eat for dinner and lunch the next day.  The menu offers unique Indian dishes that you will not find at most Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh.  

Price: The prices are incredibly fair considering the quality and quantity of the food.  On a menu with 50+ items less than 5 were priced more than $10.  Most were in the $7-9 range.  Two of us shared an appetizer, dosa, two entrees, and two mango lassis for $39 with tip included.  Remarkable.

Drinks: BYOB.  There are non-alcoholic Indian drinks to choose from as well like the delicious mango lassi.

Atmosphere: Udipi seems to be in the middle of nowhere.  The address is Monroeville, but it is on Old William Penn Highway.  If you go at night, you drive through darkness and then a shining beacon of light appears, which is Udipi.  The interior is like a cafe/diner with booths and small tables.  The decor is very modest, which focuses all of the attention on the delicious food.

Service: The wait staff was prompt and friendly.  They answered all questions we had about the menu and were more than happy to make sure we got the exact dish we wanted.  The food and drinks came quickly, they spared us time to eat the appetizers prior to bringing the entrees, and the bill came quick.

(+): great food, great price, great service

(-): driving out to Monroeville to get there

Would I go back again? If I was in the area, I would no doubt go to Udipi as often as possible.  Living in the city, I'll drive out there occasionally for the incredible food.  If you're craving Indian, its worth the drive."}
{"text":"Even though there are Indian restaurants closer to town, Udipi is definitely worth a visit from time to time. South Indian is hard to come by and can be harder to do well. Udipi gets it right, which was a pleasant surprise.

As others have indicated, you don't go to Udipi for the service or decor. Be prepared to have to flag someone down to take your order (perhaps a couple times) till you get the right person.

The dosas and uttapam are delicious. I've enjoyed the various curries I've tried as well. And the coconut chutney that is served with the dosas is my favorite.

One my most recent visit, we came at a time when the restaurant was full and some larger groups than ours were waiting for a table longer, but our group of 3 only had to wait ~5 minutes. The food came pretty quickly after we ordered, everything was tasty and relatively well-priced, so overall I would recommend."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Pittsburgh! Hands down! Great selection and the fact that it's where everyone from the Hindu-Jain temple go to eat should tell you something."}
{"text":"First time at Udipi and we don't have much experience with Indian food. Read many of the Yelp reviews for this place and decided to try it. Have to say we really enjoyed it. Very casual - good for bringing the kids or with a small group. They do take out. Credit cards accepted. This reminds me of going to my hometown pizza shop - except they serve really awesome Indian food. All vegetarian - just in case you didn't know. I read several reviews about the service not being great - have to say our waiter was very helpful and patient. Good service. I also didn't mind the casual atmosphere - I don't need fancy to enjoy good food. Really nice experience. I won't get into our order simply because - as I said - we're just not very familiar with it. My sense is that anything on the menu would be good."}
{"text":"Udipi is located on an old auto trail off the beaten path in Monroeville. Situated only one mile away from a Hindu temple, this restaurant attracts a large Indian clientele, which is generally a good sign for South Asian food. 

The exterior and decor is unremarkable and dated, but the parking lot is always full, so you shouldn't let the exterior discourage you. 

The service is polite, and basically you're seated, your order is taken, and you're left alone to eat until you're offered a tea or coffee after you're finished stuffing your face - so the service may be interpreted as curt by conventional North American standards.

The food, which tastes great, is vegetarian friendly and the portions are generous. If you venture here and are at a loss for what to order, I'd highly recommend getting a Thali and enjoying the variety. The tea they serve here, which I think is flavored with cardamon, is also quite nice.

Udipi is the type of place that lets its South Indian food speak for itself."}
{"text":"Very very slow service :(

Waited for 10 minutes to place the order. Been waiting for more than 20 minutes and haven't got the food!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but the reason for 2 stars is : the hospitality of the staff was horrible to say the least. Don't expect to be greeted properly when you arrive and also when you place the order."}
{"text":"First off, Udipi isn't in the middle of nowhere.  It's on a somewhat isolated stretch of Old William Penn Highway, but for people from the city who think it's isolated, that comes from unfamiliarity with the area.  I'd imagine the location is GREAT for people going to and from the nearby SV Temple, for example.
I live right up the hill from Udipi, and while my dad and sister have been there a few times, I hadn't until recently.  The food is very, very good, and it's a quiet, low-key kind of place during the week, with a steady stream of customers.  I've seen it quite busy on weekends.

I can't comment on the authenticity of the food, because I'm not Indian, but I really enjoyed everything that I had and I can't wait to get it again. It's a great value, better perhaps than India Garden, which I also like, but I feel like Udipi is the more homey of the two and definitely the best-kept-secret.  The waitstaff were also really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We love the food and have always enjoyed the place, despite the lack of ambiance. 

This was the same at lunch today - EXCEPT that one of the four of us NEVER got our food. While one person apologized when we paid for 3 lunches and cancelled the food that never arrived, our server just shrugged. 

They were extremely busy, but when 3 people finish their meals and keep asking after the missing food, that is something to profusely apologize for AND make up for in some way.

Disappointed."}
{"text":"The quality of a South Indian restaurant and that too Udipi is based on the taste of Sambar! The sambar was 4 on 5 and hence the food too. Great food and the Dosas were crispy and tasty though a bit smaller than regular restaurants! They have 19 varieties of Dosas and the best one I liked was the Paneer Dosa."}
{"text":"Delicious South Indian, all vegetarian food like none other I have found in Pittsburgh!  A little out of the way but well worth a visit.  Usually the place is full of families and other taste-seekers.

Try the channa batura for an enormous puffy fried bread (aka \"meteor bread.\")  They also have nice dosas and interesting appetizer platters with lentil doughnuts and other fried spicy treats.  They also do a nice pulled Mysore coffee.  Interestingly, they don't ask how spicy you want your food....but usually there hasn't been a problem and I am pretty weak."}
{"text":"Ordered masala dosa, loved the food.
They should increase the serving size for idli/vada sambhar."}
{"text":"No doubt the best South Indian food in the area. The service and ambiance are basic but the food is incredible. Dosas are great, the curries are fresh, the sauces are perfect, and the breads are fabulous. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Arguably the best Indian food I've ever had (or at least in the top 2). They feature South Indian food you won't find elsewhere, at least in Pittsburgh, including the miraculous dosas. Great spice, quantity, and quality. Humble decor, but it hardly matters when the food is this good."}
{"text":"I am an Indian who grew up in Malleshwaram, the old part of Bangalore in South India. The area has people from Mangalore, Mysore and of course Udipi. I grew up eating at Janata hotel, Veena stores, and CTR, all in my neighborhood. My tongue craves for that authentic taste here in the U.S. 
Remember that moment that Anton Ego has in the movie Ratatouille, where he's reminded of his childhood on his first bite of the ratatouille? I had the same moment when I ate the food at Udipi Cafe. I didn't drop a pen, I shed a tear. 
Very rarely do restaurants do that to me: take me to a different place.
And I'm glad I could feel that moment at Udipi Cafe.

I want to be rational however, and I'm not giving it the five stars because the ambiance isn't the greatest. Some brighter lights and spaced out seating can fix that though. Personally, I could eat on the sidewalk if the food is great, and I know that Udipi Cafe's food is right up there."}
{"text":"Great food, waiter was very helpful for my first time there. Will go back again as I work nearby."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed at Udipi Cafe. There are always Indian families here, so you know it's good. It's nice and basic, with more attention paid to the food than fancy ambiance. You can't go wrong with the extensive menu. Just go!"}
{"text":"SO TASTY!!

Establishment:
In the middle of nowhere! :)  No frills, no fuss.  You're there for the food.

Service:
As other reviews pointed out, the service was simply \"ok.\"  But given how busy they were, I'm not sure I could expect otherwise.

Food:
Excellent selection of tasty dishes, not just the predictable ones.  We weren't asked for preferred spiciness.  Sure, I would have liked it a bit hotter, but certainly can't complain about the flavors!!  I wish I could be eloquent, but all I've got is NYOM NYOM NYOM.

Recommendation:
The malai kofta curry is a particular winner!!  The creamy sauce was amazing, and the kofta were simply delicious.  I /highly/ recommend it.

Vegetarian:
Pure heaven!  The meat-eaters didn't seem to care/notice that meat wasn't on the menu.


WARNING:
Parking became tight (understatement) as we were trying to leave.  And I have no idea why, but there were a bunch of stupid little kids outside.  The parents didn't care that the tots were doing their best to die-by-car (diving out in front of the cars in the dark).  I don't hold that against Udipi, just the \"parents.\"  Be careful!"}
{"text":"I have been eating Indian food for about 15 years and this place serves the best I have had to date. We are talking about South Indian fare here. Udipi Cafe is a wonderful choice for vegetarians, but flavorful and filling enough for hardened artery types. 

I'm wasting time typing this and you are wasting time reading. Go to Udipi Cafe! Order the Mysore Masala Dosa and the Idli. Better yet, go during lunch and get a lunch special. Go with a companion and share."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a visit to Udipi! One of two favorite Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh, I love the vegetarian selection. Everything I've had here is absolutely delicious and I've tried a lot. I can order multiple items and beverages and still walk out for around 20 bucks and very full. The staff is always on point, even when they are packed you will receive your food in a timely order. I've never had to complain about anything there. Always a satisfying experience. Go give them your business!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, way under staffed. Much improvement desired in the ambience of the place. Food is fairly average."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to be adventerous with food. Based on other Yelpers, we decided to give this little gem a try.
Please understand, even with GPS, this place is hard to find on your first try. We drove past it twice!
The parking lot isn't very spacious and from the outside, things aren't very promising. 
The interior is a step up from the parking lot. Things are clean, but it reminded me of a very compact, nursing home cafeteria.
The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful. Our waiter's English was a little rough, but he worked very hard to convey the specialities of the house and make sure we were well cared for the entire meal.
I honestly don't know what everything was named that we ordered; as we put our trust in the server's hands, but we had a VERY large puffy bread with spicy chickpeas, a thin crepe like bread filled with potatoes  and a cauliflower curry. Everything was delicious! We were pretty suprised at how good everything was actually.
The better suprise occured when we recieved the check, less than $24 for three meals!! 
With these prices, an extensive menu with quality food and great service, we'll be back. I only wish that the interior were a little nicer."}
{"text":"Best South Indian Vegetarian food for the price. Some comments are about service not being the greatest, but that's how small places with delicious food are. They care more about the quality of food. I know for fact that food is fresh here. Yeah, you will need to communicate with them if you want better seating etc. Every time I visit city of Pittsburgh, I make sure to have a meal at Udipi. I always remember the delicious taste of food from last visit."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not what I expected after reading all these rave reviews. I love Indian food, so when we had to go to Monroeville for the day, this place was the first place that came to mind when considering dinner.  The restaurant building is unassuming and very modest. We were greeted blankly and seated in a booth. No background music. A worker sat in the corner booth with his cell phone up full blast watching what sounded like Indian music videos. It was a strange mix of random music and patches of awkward silence. We ordered our food. Both my husband and I thought it was decent, but we've had better in the 'burgh. It also didn't help that we kept having to swat away flies from our dishes every 45 seconds. Glad I didn't drive all the way to Monroeville just for this."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food, i truly believe that you can't get this type of food in India! The dosa is thin and crispy the sambar has a nice tang and spice. If i had one negative about this place it would be the rude servers and probably all the illegal mexicans running the joint, but hey what can you do. Great food."}
{"text":"Excellent south Indian food! 

The ambiance is not that great and the service is OK, but the food is excellent! Among one of the best South Indian restaurants I've been to in the US! 
We went there for dinner on Saturday and there was a long wait. Parking could be a problem sometimes."}
{"text":"Service is as important as the food is. They  seem to be over their heads. We stood there for 10 minutes before the guy acknowledged our presence. A couple who were there before us got fed up and left!
Food was good... It's a shame that they don't have people skills."}
{"text":"I don't think it's possible to rave enough about this place.  It's in the most random location on Old William Penn Highway, and if \"location, location, location\" is the key to a business succeeding, Udipi should be in trouble.  The reason it's not is that the food is uh-may-zing.

I am giving this place full stars despite the fact that the layout and decor are awful, and feel like a cafeteria, and the staff is almost without exception unfriendly and refuses to make eye contact.  You pretty much have to trip a waiter to get your drink refilled.

I don't even care, though.  The food is heaven.  It's nirvana on a plate.  It's spicy and authentic and delicious, and I overeat every time I go there.  They have a really large menu with a wide variety (something often missing in vegetarian restaurants), and I always have a crisis of indecision when I go there, because I know that it's pretty much impossible to go wrong.  

Thumbs way, way up.  Make the drive!  It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is great but the owner (bald guy with beard) has no clue how to be a good host. He was very rude and was also screaming at his staff. One of our friend did not get his food until everyone else was finished. I would probably go again as the food was good but if you cannot withstand hostile environment, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"This is my favorite S. Indian restaurant around here. Of course that doesn't say much if the other restaurants aren't so good. However, the other restaurants aren't so bad, just Udipi is so much better. 

Prices are excellent. Everything is so yummy. It's hard not to overeat. Of course you don't go to this place for the decor. It's convenient for those who are going to temple. The service is also very friendly and helpful. If you aren't Indian, they will scale down how spicy hot is. 

It is well worth the drive. Honestly if I could have Udipi every day, I could actually become a vegetarian."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was very favorably impressed with the food when I visited Udipi in July 2009 with my family.  Udipi was the first restaurant I visited when I returned to Pgh in April 2012,  On this visit I was by myself on a Saturday evening.  The place was busy, but I was seated quickly.  The decor is very sparse and the lighting is glaringly bright.  My order was taken, and my food came within a reasonable time.  It was the South Indian Thali platter (small portions of several items).  The food was OK, but not fantastic.  The platter includes a cup of tea, which never was delivered to my table.  And although I kept waving at servers walking past, none ever stopped.  After finishing my meal, I walked to the front desk, and was presented a bill for the full amount.  I told the cashier that I had not received my tea and could an adjustment be made?  \"How about we give you tea in a to-go cup?\"  I accepted that, paid and left, thinking that I would not be returning - ever.  Disclaimer: I am spoiled, living in Los Angeles County where many Indian and other vegan and vegetarian restaurants exist.  If I still lived in Penn Hills, where I grew up, I may make an allowance because of the relative scarcity of vegetarian restaurants in this area.  Udipi has an abundance of Indian customers, and my never returning won't make a difference in their long term success; but I want people to know of my experience of eating a meal without the cup of tea that the menu says is included."}
{"text":"This is a real Indian food experience, I.E. vegetarian. You can get both north and south food here and they are equally good.

I would suggest trying them during lunch since their lunch specials are such a good deal. Try a dosa!"}
{"text":"Udipi is too good for words. It's just too good for words. 

So here's a photo instead: 
http://www.inheaven.name/misc/images/heaven/heaven.jpg"}
{"text":"Got takeout, paneer tikka masala and an onion dosa. Both AWESOME!! Plus they came with a bunch of condiments including raiita. If they had naan, it would have been perfect."}
{"text":"Wait staff should get negative stars, food is good though.

Waiter refused to customize order, refused to pack food. Gave attitude the entire time. Not planning on coming back because of him. I have dietary restrictions and this is a restaurant whose entire appeal is that it targets vegetarians. I think they can afford to customize a bit more. Too bad, waste of a cooks talent."}
{"text":"Disappointed by the service. We were hoping for a nice warm dinner before heading back home and stopped at Udipi Cafe on Old William Penn Highway. The food was decent, but the service was horrible. It took them forever to take our order. My daughter's food was not served until all of us had already eaten. We had to wait about 20 minutes for dessert, and it was not served till we had already gathered our things to leave.

We tried to point out the poor service to the manager and he responded very disdainfully that the restaurant was busy, and there was no apology for poor service.

We have been to plenty of restaurants that are busier and hold their staff accountable for providing quality.

Once again- disappointed."}
{"text":"The best Indian food hands down, 100% authentic.

I love getting a thali.  It comes with everything you could possibly want in an Indian meal.  The South Indian special is also outstanding.  My goal is to one day be able to finish an entire thali.  Overall, good service (particularly for an Indian restaurant) and completely worth the twenty-minute drive to Monroeville.  Eating at Udipi helps me to understand why the vegetables are so good you don't miss the meat.  Also, good water service, which is nice considering the spice levels are not oriented to the American palate. 

Indian restaurants are places where it's so comforting to have subcontinental natives outnumber Americans.  Udipi Cafe delivers."}
{"text":"Makes other Indian restaurants look bad. Every dish is so flavorful and *epic*. The paneer seems like it was freshly churned - nothing like the excessively chewy varieties I've had elsewhere. It's hard for me to order anything besides the matar paneer - so flavorful and a huge plus that it comes with raita- but others' dishes have been equally amazing. The chana masala is a crowd favorite. Definitely try the poori - delicious fried bread the size of my head that is a perfect accompaniment! Reheats well too."}
{"text":"Even though I am not a vegetarian, this is my favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. The flavors are so robust and deep. The foods are fun too. I can't remember what it is called but they serve a long crisy \"crepe\" filled with potatoes and vegetables - amazing!"}
{"text":"Came back here for a dinner with my sweetie and like always, I was so impressed with the food. Yes, the atmosphere sucks, and yes, the plastic dishes are worn and tacky, but the food is right on point.

I had matar paneer, one of my favorite Indian dishes, and the paneer had a wonderful toothsome texture and slightly tangy taste. It was the best I've had anywhere. We ordered poori, a deep-fried whole grain bread, and they were airy, light, crispy, with just the right amount of decadent richness.

My mango lassi was perfect--not too sweet, but full of yummy mango flavor. It was a perfect accompaniment to the spicy meal. My husband had the baingan bartha and said it was the best he's ever tasted.

There's a reason Pittsburghers make this trek again and again!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I love their Dosa/Uttapam/Idly/cutlet etc. Rotis are soft.
Had okra curry - good. Chhole - good. Potato curry -amazing. Amazing butermilk. 
Note: Service sucks. But go for food."}
{"text":"I was taken by a friend. It isn't a very clean place- it's plastic utensils and melamine plates and plastic drinking glasses- and the waiter took us to the very back, when we requested a new seat- he tried to shove us back into the side crowded area-where the bathrooms are located,  with the other white people- 
 I finally just walked to one of the many open and empty booths in the main room and sat. 

 I ordered the palak paneer (spinach with fresh cheese).  My friend ordered the onion masala dosa.  His dish was about $7.50, mine about $8. I also ordered a standard mango lassi. It was standard.

 A large crispy dosa was brought to my friend- with maybe- 2 tablespoons of filling 5 inches long in a 12 inch long dosa. He offered me a taste, as my dish hadn't arrived. 
 I took a very tiny bite- as there was almost nothing to bite there. A good 5 minutes or so later my dish arrived. My friends food had been  consumed by then.

   Finally, a bowl of dark green spinach appeared. It had obviously been sitting in a warming tray for hours. And we ate at around 8PM. When one would presume a dinner crowd would expect somewhat fresh fare.
   What cheese I could manage to fish out- was compact and hard, and obviously old.
 I often make fresh paneer myself- I managed a vegetarian Indian restaurant some 25 years ago- I know what to expect. I've been cooking Indian food for 25 years. 
  I roast and grind my own blends of curries and garam masalas. 
  It was bitter- and unappetizing. That's what happens when heavily spiced dishes sit on warming trays for hours.
 There was no rice. I reminded the waiter- no rice ever arrived. I also asked if I might have some chutney- or yogurt- 
  Anything to offset the blandness and monotony of a bowl of old spinach- god forbid I should ask for a $3 piece of bread- of course I got nothing.
 The rice, which was supposed to come with the overpriced dinner- never did arrive.
 
   It was a crappy cheap restaurant-  the food was way overpriced- and the quality was way under par. 
  I left feeling ripped off, and pissed off.

 Oh, and still very hungry."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I had been to Udipi Cafe. Too long. It was even more delicious than I remembered. I started out with some rasam. It was hot (in both ways)- just the way I like it. Then I had some mendhu vada, some of which I dipped in the rasam- perfect. For the main course, it was paneer dosa. I usually can't eat it all, but I licked the plate clean. I capped it all off with a mango lassi. As usual, everyone was so friendly and kind. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful vegetarian Indian food.  The restaurant is a little out of the way, and the decor is definitely lacking, but the service and food more than make up for it.   We had samosas to start which were amazing, and papadam that was serviceable but with sauces that were top notch.  Both of our entrees were delicious.  Staff were helpful and attentive, and our wait for food was short.  I would definitely recommend this as an affordable and high quality Indian restaurant.  Don't be deterred by the appearance, the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Ordered rassam soup, masala dosa, plain uttapam and mango milk shake. Really delicious and genuine South Indian vegetarian meal."}
{"text":"I have to say when I saw the venue I really wasn't sure about the place. And inside the tables were a bit humble if you know what I mean. But it was full of Indian people so I figured that was a good indicator right off the bat. And the yelp reviews I'd read proved correct. Everything was delicious. We ordered too much food for us to finish .. I guess our eyes were bigger than our bellies. Give it a go. We came from out of town and were staying in a local hotel. This was a great choice."}
{"text":"I know this place is very popular but I have gotten an upset stomach three times in a row. I can't say I would be open to trying it again."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious.   started with the donut appetizer (there is a picture of it).  The dipping sauces were fantastic but the donuts themselves were a bit too dry.   I ordered the chickpea curry with poori bread.  It was $6.99 which was a bit on the pricey side since it was a bowl of chick peas and a bowl of rice.  Price aside, it was pretty tasty and I had a great time slopping up the chick peas and rice with the puffy bread.  The last time i went i ordered the lunch special which came with 8 small cups filled with a variety of sauces and other items like chick peas and lentils.  This is a nice way to sample different ingredients on one plate.  Not only does Udipi provide excellent food but the unique experience makes it a special destination.   As a side note, the service isn't going to win any awards but really do we ever ask \"where can we go to get great service?\""}
{"text":"Okay,  had read a lot of Yelp reviews regarding bad service here,  but also read that the food is good, so thought of visiting this place on our way back from Pittsburgh. And true to the rating,  the service is terrible. When they are crowded, it's like they forget you exist. The heavy guy at the counter was a total a**, extremely rude. Our host (who was a treat amidst the chaos) and food arrived late, but it was good. Ordered the udupi Thali and the south Indian Thali.. Their dosas are a must try.    Please please manage the place better.  Haven't Yelpers complained enough!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for years, I finally went with a big group of friends. It was so awesome! There were 16 of us, so I was lucky enough to get to try tons of stuff from the menu, as we ordered many dishes and shared them around.  The dosas were great, I also remember the aloo gobi and palak paneer standing out, the samosas were huge, and the vegetable cutlet was another delicious highlight.  I can't think of one dish that we ordered that was not completely devoured, really.

Though this place is certainly humble, service is fine. The staff were very good sports about accommodating our large group, which was a bit ramshackle and gregarious.  We weren't even sure how many people were coming, and once we had all arrived, they helped us sit in a more comfortable place for a group our size, not seeming at all annoyed at having to deal with a large group.  We did go on a Monday evening, though, that was fairly quiet.

I agree regarding the affordability - our bill averaged out to $14 per person, including the tip, and that's after ordering many appetizers, desserts, etc in addition to the entrees.  I can't wait to go back!  If not for it being a little removed from the city, I think I would eat here all the time.

It's BYOB, FYI."}
{"text":"Udipi cafe is perhaps the most authentic Indian food I have ever tasted (I'm Punjabi Indian). The Palak Paneer is spot on and the Puris are delicious. I assure all of you who are on the fence, the drive out to Monroeville is well worth it. 

Note: Go for the food, don't worry about the ambiance."}
{"text":"We have been on the road almost a week, moving from Berkeley to Boston. Road food for vegetarians is dismal! THANKFULLY my Happy Cow app (vegetarian restaurants) steered me right to Udipi Cafe. OMG. We've been eating Indian food for decades, and consider ourselves well-versed in the cuisine. We even traveled to India for the FOOD. This restaurant (in Monroeville, of all places) knocked our socks off. The two of us ordered for three, and everything we ate was amazing. Thank You Happy Cow for telling us about this place, and Thank You Udipi Cafe for making such fabulous food."}
{"text":"Though busy, the service was quick. 
One of the best restaurants for the taste and quality food. Authentic South Indian. Loved samosas and Mysore Masala Dosa. 
You don't really care about ambience that much when you have real good food!"}
{"text":"In a city with a fair amount of Indian restaurants, Udipi stands out with their amazing food.  Udipi is restaurant that specializes in Southern Indian cuisine, thus it is all vegetarian. The food is well spiced and comes in filling portions. My personal favorite is the mysore masala dosa (potatoes and onions spiced with turmeric, coriander, and mustard seed and a chili paste spread on the dosa)  and idli, which is spongy and delicious! Meals are prepared fairly quickly, so it is good for a hearty lunch during the week if you work or live in the area. Please note that there is a $15 minimum for credit card payments.

While Udipi is a bit off the path, it is very much worth the trek for this culinary delight."}
{"text":"This little gem of an Indian restaurant is hidden away near a large Indian temple in Pittsburgh. But if you make the trip out  here, you will not leave disappointed. 

Udipi is an all vegetarian restaurant (meat eaters - don't run away! You need to try this part of Indian cuisine, and you will be converted... at least for a day!) that serves primarily south Indian dishes, with a splattering of (extremely delicious) North Indian dishes as well. 

Get the fried Idis, Paneer butter masala with Chapatis and the Channa Bhatura if you're not sure of what to order.... you will not be disappointed! \"}
{"text":"Excellent idlis, dosas, and puris, makes for a great snack or a meal, finished off with their fragrant masala chai or even a lassi! 

The thalis, however, leave something to desire for -- not a fan of the lazy daals, adding red beans does not make for a variation on lentils, especially when there are so many different types of lentils to choose from in the Indian culinary repertoire! My grandmother and mother (tough critics of Subcontinent cuisine, to be sure) thought the various curries were \"meh,\" the rice too was bland (\"could have used some ghee,\" said my grandmother) but we loved the fresh dosas and the huge puris!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Go for temple food! Unfriendly and arrogant staff. Don't try it. Doesn't deserve even single star rating - Adarsh"}
{"text":"This place might seem to be a total dive but it the BEST south Indian food around. I recommend any dosa and the spicy rasam vada soup."}
{"text":"A popular Indian place in Pittsburgh with a combination of hit/miss food and mediocre service.
We visited on a Saturday night and the place was packed. Few of our items took forever to show up.They mixed up some of our items with others and there was some confusion with the final bill.

The only items worth mentioning were pongal(rice cooked with lentils, laden with ghee,peppercons and cashews) and mirchi bajji( chillies stuffed with spices and batter fried). The vegetable cutlet is definitely stale and tasted really bad. Overall,the food and service were sub-par."}
{"text":"Udipi is a great hidden gem off of 376 in Monroeville! I have been here a few times and love the traditional foods that they serve. 

I've visited several different Indian restaurants and this is by far one of my favorites. While the restaurant my not look like much from the outside, the food they serve is delicious. The Malai Kofta is my absolute favorite. It's sweet yet savory and is served with a side of rice. The portions are very large and I always have leftovers to take home for the next day (or meal!) They also have AMAZING coffee!

The service can be hit or miss. While everyone there is very welcoming and friendly, they do not hover or check in frequently. I personally don't mind this as I enjoy only having someone come by every so often, but others find this to be off putting. Definitely recommend if you are looking to try a new Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is disaster, service is too bad, food has no quality. Fat guy who works as waiter and sits in counter is a big a*******, am sure he is not owner. he don't even know how to treat customers.

After a long wait, we got food with no quality, no taste.
Instead of calling sambar we should call it as color water.
Don't waste time by going to this place, it's better being hungry."}
{"text":"Best and most reasonably priced Indian food I have ever had.  The dosa is to die for.  My favorite is the one with onions and potatoes.  No alcohol is served, but you are permitted to bring your own beer or wine.  Decor is sparse, but you go their for the fabulous food, not the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Horrible food, they use old oil Food was smelling, might be serving old food I would never suggest anybody this restaurant."}
{"text":"Spicy, tasty , generous portions, felt like we were  visiting a restaurant in India. My husband was the only white guy , but the place was packed. If Udipi Cafe were near me, I'd being going every week!"}
{"text":"So, yesterday I went to this Indian restaurant and there were a few people waiting and they were all waiting for a seat. I asked the waiter how long it would take to get a seat. He said it would take ten mins. I waited ten mins and asked him where we can sit. The same waiter said it would take him ten mins to get a seat. After waiting 20 mins for a seat I finally got one. The waiter came and gave me a glass of water. I took a sip of the water and smelled something in the water. There seemed to be dish soap in the water. I was disgusted. The waiter came and took my order and it took him 1 hour to bring the food! Most of the food was burnt and he wouldn't let me take the food home! If you ever go here than please make sure to check your water and ask them to give you non-burnt food. Hope you  have a better time there than I did!"}
{"text":"Udipi used to be our go to place for vegetarian food. My wife absolutely loves their butter paneer dosas. I like their idli sambhar and gobhi manchurian. Their north Indian food is good as well and I have tried chana bhatura, paneer curry, and parathas amongst other things. However, my last experience was horrendous. The owner seemed pissed at one of the employees and he was yelling around. Me and my family were waiting to be seated and he paid no regard to that. That was an unforgettable and unforgivable incident and we haven't been there since. Customer satisfaction apart, we come from India where we treat guests as Gods. But still there food is good and you should try it. As I said, I had been there dozen times before and didn't experience such a problem."}
{"text":"Very authentic South Indian vege. Dosas were great. Had samosas and vada, both excellent. Mango lassi was delicious. It's located right near the Temple in Monroeville right off Rodi road. It has ample parking. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Awesome food. We stopped there on our drive from DC to Detroit. We loved the food. We ordered samosas, bondas, dal vadas, idlis for appetizers. They were all gr8. For our mains we all got dosas. Wow some of the bat dosas we have ever had. 

They were swamped so the service not 100% but the food made up for it. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I won't disagree that the service is the most disinterested I've ever witnessed, but the food's good enough to make up for it. Even getting here was an experience---it's in a comically nondescript building with a sketchy parking lot in the middle of the woods, but that's an aside. After the difficulty navigating the lot and brusque service, the food made it well worth it. In particular, the dosas had a particularly rich flavor that I hadn't experienced in other dosas, and the uthappam were also mind-expanding. I'd happily detour from the turnpike/parkway interchange again."}
{"text":"I have never had such bad service in my life. The waiters were rude, did not get our plates or refill our water, messed up our water, took forever to bring our food (and it was cold).
The place is dirty, cold (even though we are sitting by the heater) and the food isn't very good (besides being cold when it came out, the chutney was like water, and the sambar was cold and bad). The coffee was so bad, it tasted like burnt filtered coffee. 

They didn't even get our 3 yo a high chair after we asked twice, we had to find one ourselves. The waiter and the manager talked back to us  when we tried to voice our complaints. They made us move tables (with two little kids) to accommadate another party that did NOT come. 

tl;dr very rude personnel, bad food, I would not waste my time here! (if you're at the temple, eat at the temple. if you're somewhere else, don't come this far.)"}
{"text":"Appearances are deceiving. Even though, from the narrow road and neglected area it seems to be a terrible place to eat. It is the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. I wish I had the opportunity to dine or order out from there more often."}
{"text":"Unique south Indian food.  Very different from regular Indian restaurants.  My Indian friend took me here many times.  I like Paper Masala Dosai.  If you go with friends more than two or three, try Assorted appetizers.  Good vegetarian restaurant too.
my Indian friend recommendation: menu for 4
Royal Udipi Appetizer
Paper Masala Dosai
Dinner Special South India Thali
with Lassi
If you want Soup, choose Rasam"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get. I understand this isn't a buffet, but you should for sure get more per order. I find the staff a bit condescending and they seem to make fun of you if you are not Indian. I swear they have two difference priced menus, one for Indians and one for others. Don't get me wrong, food is tasty but not worth the price."}
{"text":"My favorite dosa and idli place, although recently, the spices appear to have been toned down perhaps to suit those who prefer a milder taste."}
{"text":"If an Indian restaurant is packed with Indian families eating when you walk in it has to be good.  This place was great.  All the food was wonderful."}
{"text":"Hands down the best south indian food in the pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"So good!! I will without a doubt return the next time I am in Pittsburgh. Extensive vegetarian menu. Generous portions, attentive service and super reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Excellent, delicious ,variety, Reasonably priced food. We were seated immediately, a little delay in taking the order and getting the food.. All that we ordered was mouthwatering!! Will be back next time we are in area!! Recommend it to one & all. One star less (4/5) is for ambience-overcrowded, need for space"}
{"text":"Best southern Indian in the great Pittsburgh area.  Go here, get the Dosa, and one of every other of the delicious fermented grain based breads!  You'll be astonished there's no egg or butter in there!

Well worth the drive out that way.  Now, where's the northern Indian spot with equivalent quality?!"}
{"text":"yea, so this is the real deal, best udipi place in the metro pittsburgh area, and really on par with anything I've had in the US (though by udipi exp is limited to boston, nyc and pittsburgh, and there was this one time I tried to chase an udipi truck in NYC and was never able to find it so maybe we'll never know)
Pretty much everything is good, cheap, and significant portions
apps: I like the gold old fried Idly
main course: anything is good really, I like the butter dosa, a feast for the eyes and the palates, the nose does ok as well.  beware the bathroom is a little funky
desert: they got good stuff but I'm not a deserts man myself.
things that could be improved: put meat in things...this is veg only, but thats kinda of a violation of the whole principle of things
serve booz....which might also be a violation of spiritual principles

things to see around: the local ?south indian temple, and the 9/11 memorial is nearby"}
{"text":"Not even close, easily the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh, and one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh, period.  As someone who cannot go a day without meat, I could become vegetarian as long as my food tasted like this.  Even my kids, who would list Indian food as their least favorite, have always enjoyed the food here."}
{"text":"The food was good, the staff is terrible. We went there and from the moment we stepped in the guy with the beard was being sarcastic. We sat down and ordered. He  came unto me and said\" we have a problem, we don't allow texting in the restaurant.\" He then TOOK MY phone and put in the the other waiters pocket, and said\" your gonna take her phone right\" and I said NO give me my phone back. He said\" a no from a girl means yes\", which I thought was completely rude and disrespectful. Trying not to make a scene I asked for it back creeped out at this point. I then asked the waiter for tomato chutney, he looked at me as if I asked him for tiramasu or something and then proceeded to say we don't have chutney but he will bring something. What they brought was sriracha sauce mixed with a tomato,and I can vouch for this because everyone my table tried it and agreed with it. I was really annoyed at this point and told the bald bearded guy that this was not chutney put some weird mix they put together. This is the first bad experience I have had here, but it was bad enough to make me not want to come back for such horrible and rude service."}
{"text":"First time here. Very good food. I always enjoy a good Indian food spot and we initially came here because a friend from out of town was visiting. He is Vegan so we came here because they have good vegetarian and vegan options. 
I loved the Palak Paneer, spinach and cheese dish- my fave! I would definitely come back here again :)
Also try the puffy bread perfect for dipping in Raita or whatever dish you get!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian Indian restaurant that serves both south and both Indian dishes (though mainly South Indian). The outside of the building is not very pretty and its location next to a quarry on the side of a highway road is rather odd. However the food is all fresh and excellent quality their dosa are comparable to the ones I've had in India itself. I've probably had everything off of their menu though I'm partial to the Royal udipi dinner which comes with several items including dosa sambar vada and tea. The best dosa is the spring Dosa which is filled with cabbage curry instead of the regular potato curry. Don't be deterred by the outside!"}
{"text":"Excellent grub.  I'm a lifelong carnivore, but forgot completely once the food started to hit the table.  I really like the low-key atmosphere, also.  Genuine, without all the glam.  \"Meteor bread\" with the chickpea side FTW."}
{"text":"Udipi cafe in Pittsburgh is a South Indian gem.  For a flavorful spice in a masala dosa (crepe), try Udipi.  The restaurant gets very busy after service from the nearby temple. Generally, once you are seated, the waiter will take your order.  Make sure you eat with your hands (after you wash them, of course, because that's how dosas should be eaten).  When finished, we just pay at the cashier. I've always left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I knew I hit the ethnic food jackpot when I walked into Udipi because I was literally the only non-brown person there. This has always been my rule of thumb when it comes to ethnic food...trust the ethnic people! This restaurant is pretty casual and spacious. It looks more like a family diner. The service was super friendly and accommodating. They kept checking up on our party to make sure we were enjoying our food. 

The menu was straightforward and all the cuisines are clearly explained. This is a vegetarian restaurant, so all of the dishes are vegetarian. Since I came with a large party, I had the opportunity to try a little bit of everything. I don't remember the exact names, but everything I tried was delicious, from the dosa to the rice dishes. Even though this place is vegetarian, I think non-vegetarians will still really enjoy the food because of the well-blended flavors. For those unable to handle a little heat, be careful what you order because some dishes are naturally spicy. If there's \"spicy\" in the name, it is most likely really spicy. 

Overall, I highly recommend Udipi to all the vegetarian and Indian food lovers out there. It's a bit out of the way, but worth the drive. The food was well executed and quite authentic."}
{"text":"The restaurant food is alright. However the staff is quite rude.(specially the bald guy with beard)

He comes in for taking the order ...we told that we were not ready and if he cud cme in a few minutes. 
When we were ready to give the order...he told us bluntly to wait and cant come again and again...he wasnt doing anything at that time either...
(We were the first ones on sunday to cme to the restaurant and there werent any other guests at that time).
He was also shouting at his staff all the time...

Our experience at the restaurant turned sour because of the staff behavior..."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have eaten at for Indian food. Everything is fresh and authentic. Highly recommended. Excellent selection and very fair pricing."}
{"text":"I drove to this restaurant based on its Yelp reviews to find it's STRICTLY VEGETARIAN. Sounds like the food is good, but I wouldn't know because I was craving chicken tikka masala"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the Pittsburgh area. I love their chole batura. Food here is a little too far on the greasy side, so can't eat here too often, but its a really awesome occasional treat. Their dosas and lassis are also really awesome."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. The food was great! The garlic Naan was perfect. Plenty in each portion"}
{"text":"Five for the food, knock off two for the service, and one more for the ambience. After all this time and success, they owe their customers more. 

Normally I don't rate service over food quality, but this couldn't pass. We hadn't been there for a while, and decided to go for Easter dinner.  It is not easy for us, as we need to park someplace close to the door. The Udipi Cafe was perfect. We arrived early so we could park close by.  We had read the service could be surly and slow, but this was out of control.  I asked myself if I had ever had such unprofessional service in my long career of restaurant attendance? Nope. not even close.  

Greeted by a growly man I'll call Moe Howard, the place was virtually empty. So of course we were seated in a booth next to the service area for the wait staff.  He showed up early, and assuming we were ready, let us know he was ready to take our order. Yikes. Caught off guard, I responded with a no more gruffly than I had planned. Well that was it.  

He refused to return, sitting not far away and playing intently with his cell phone. Finally another, kinder man came by and took our order.  Then we waited.  People arriving after us came in, ordered, were served, ate, and left.  We would have left if there was another place close by.  

Finally the same kindly man noticed again, and went to the cashier area. He then spoke with Moe, waving a ticket and then went into the kitchen. I assumed Moe had never turned our order into the kitchen.  By now an hour had passed. 

When our food finally arrived, again delivered by the kindly man, I asked what had happened. Being very polite, he told me that they had run out of chickpeas.  Really?  The Udipi Cafe ran out of chickpeas?  

The food was fine, but the dinner had a different taste....tough getting past the bad taste in my mouth from the service. 

Of course we won't be back. Too afraid.  Won't take the chance. Moe will be happy.  That's a shame, as I have recommended it often, taken international students there for dinner, and enjoyed the food.  But professionalism counts too, and the Cafe can't afford to ignore it."}
{"text":"Very bad service. The waiters were very rude and took very long time right from providing table and serving food."}
{"text":"Huge variety of food on the menu, and everything I've tried is really tasty. All vegetarian, which is a pro or con depending on your preference. The quantities are pretty large and low prices, so great value here. The space is clean and comfortable enough, but I don't exactly go there for the ambiance (reminds me of a a causal pizza place inside)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the privilege to hear about this place while visiting friends in Pittsburgh. They said we HAD to go.

I have had Indian food hundreds of times, but this place....... I would give my cats favorite toy away to have this place closer to me.

We ordered the battered hot peppers as an appetizer, and it came with incredible dipping sauces. They were perfectly fried; not greasy. Super spicy. We knew we were in for the real deal right off the bat.

I ordered a creamy paneer yellow curry dish as my main meal, while the bf got channa masala. It was the BEST Indian food we have ever had.

We dream about this place. The service was incredible, and there were more Indian friends in the restaurant than anyone else. We knew that was also a good sign. Who better to know the food than the friends that have eaten this beautiful food for the majority of their lives?

I seriously can't wait until we go back. We spent around 55 bucks, but we ate like royalty. Way more than we normally would. We just couldn't stop. It was crazy.

Please, if you love Indian food, treat yourself. You have got to go here. Yes, it is kind of out of the way, but you will be really happy that you made the journey there, trust me."}
{"text":"Food is fine, customer service is very poor. This is my 2 and time here first time had to wait for 25 mins for someone to get my orders, now this time same stuff have to wait 35 mins 
I wouldn't come again sorry"}
{"text":"OK food. Good service. Malai Kofta needs adjustments. Dosa was good. South Indian thali was hardly worth mentioning. They have a cold small chapathi along with it and it didn't seem to be worth the $$ they charge for the item. The table where we initially sat had AC dripping water. There is no other veg restaurant around the temple and hence will continue to come to this place and order selectively &
 hope it serves good food that day (maybe use up some good karma that we accrued visiting the temple)!!!"}
{"text":"Very average South Indian food. Nothing to write home about.I have eaten in better places in New York and Columbus. The coffee was disappointing too, I think it was instant coffee."}
{"text":"Take all the good reviews for Udipi cafe,  read them!  : Udipi Cafe is all the above. 


At first, when you enter the Udipi Cafe, you can see a bunch of  Indian people eating, families & friends.  For me , it's a real good  sign, a \"seal\" of authentic cuisine.  Then, when you try the food, you'll understand. 

the only difference with \"real India\" is that, at Udipi Cafe, you CAN drink the water. 
Real flavors, real food, very good food and all  for a very affordable price. 

 it's a no brainer: just  GO! 

I'll be back  ASAP"}
{"text":"Nice vegetarian restaurant. Chola Bhatura is my fav. Also Faluda!!"}
{"text":"Horrible place . They are always in hurry to take orders , feed you and get you out of the place . The bald guy is super rude. The food isn't that great as well . Very Dirty restrooms ,flies all over , crowded place with not enough space to walk around . I wonder how the kitchen looks like now .over all a very disappointing experience specially coming from New York where you can get the best of Indian foods."}
{"text":"Great food, great people.
Excellent place to go to with family/friends.
Perfect for vegetarians!! (Purely vegetarian here)
Authentic South Indian food.
Highly highly recommend.
Ample parking space.
Accept cash/credit 
Not the fanciest place, but you can't beat the food and prices. Last word - I would recommend the South Indian dishes over the traditionally North Indian dishes here (since this is a South Indian place)...
Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"As of the most recent past I have been completely disappointed with the state of Indian food served in and around the Pittsburgh area.  According to me this is the only Indian style restaurant in Pittsburgh worthy of any praise.  I was completely impressed with their product and that is what counts the most.  I love the variety of chutney's, sauces and menu items in general.  I know it's not completely healthy, but I do love fried vegetarian food.  The dosas are absolutely lovely.  Udipi is a great place to take a date because the food is so shareable.  
  The big mistake that most people would make is to pre-jugde this place by the divey, dinery, type of environment.  Despite the old, bland look of the establishment the food is full of flavor, and color.  The other thing that I didn't think about is that the food is not overly spicey and we didn't give them a numeric spice level.  The is best service is the kind that goes unnoticed so that you can just sit back and enjoy the food.  There was not alot of communication, but I still felt like they did their best to take care of our needs.  Love, love, love!  

* Cautionary note - Be aware that sometimes it is difficult to reach them by phone.  This is typical, but doesn't mean that they are not open."}
{"text":"best authentic Indian food you can get in Pittsburgh. prices are reasonable, staff is very efficient and the food is like nothing I have ever had before. 

I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"This 'hole in the wall' restaurant deserves 5+ stars. Although its kind of out of the way from central Pittsburgh, it is worth the trip. Not only is it inexpensive, but the food is phenomenal.

My family is from South India and it 100% lives up to our high standards for this type of food. The dosas are crisp and the batter authentic and delicious and the sambar is quite literally the best I've had in America. We've literally eaten here twice in one weekend because its that good, and I even know family that makes it a point to drive through Pittsburgh when traveling from distant places such as Detroit because they love this place so much. 

Some other great items to order are chola bhatura and vada. The mango lassi is also on point.

The service is not always incredible, they take a little longer than average sometimes and can be a little rude on rare occasion but the food is so good that I still give it 5 stars. 

One thing to be aware of that it is in a strange location and looks like shack more than a restaurant, with a long, windy road leading up to it but trust me, it's worth it. 

If you're anywhere in this area or even remotely hungry/like Indian food - GO!"}
{"text":"Food is good! Clean and nice ambiance...only thing that needs to be worked on is the attitude of wait staff towards customers. Need to be a little more polite and smile. They all seem stressed and angry most of the time. Nevertheless,i love this place for the food!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best Indian restaurant in the 'burgh. Udipi is  Southern Indian, so the food is spicy. I've probably had everything on the menu, but the masala dosa will always be my favorite. Dosa (or dosai) are made with finely ground rice flour, which is made into a crepe and stuffed with various fillings. The masala dosa at Udipi is filled with a mixture of spiced mashed potatoes and onion, and served with sambar and coconut chutney. Delicious.  More standout dishes include the vegetable cutlets, which are veggies ground up and formed into a patty and then fried...I know it sounds strange, but these are wonderful. For entrees I like the channa masala, vegetable korma and baigan bartha, but, truly, anything I've eaten here I've enjoyed. If you can stand the heat, order the rasam soup as a starter; this rivals chicken soup as a cure for the common cold. Udipi is 100% vegetarian, but you carnivores and omnivores won't miss the meat, as the flavors are so outstanding here. Try the pickle to really challenge your Western palate."}
{"text":"The chana masala had a perfect blend of spices and the sauce had just the right consistency. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"We had the best meal tonight at Udipi.  Several in our group had gone before, but it was my first time.  The food was excellent, but the staff were really a highlight.  After 3 visits to the table where we told them \"we need more time,\" he wrote down the phone number on a placemat and said to call the front desk when they were ready.  Not in a hostile way - it was hilarious.   ...and we did it.

The food was all delicious - reasonable but generous portion sizes with a great amount of spice.  The somosas and dosa as appetizers were a highlight, with wonderful flavorful sauces.  The Bhatura is a must-get to soak up the rest of the sauces.

Also:  BYOB.  Their only question about what we brought was how many glasses we need."}
{"text":"Authentic South Indian cuisine at very cheap prices.  What more could you really ask for?  I can taste the masala dosai right now as I'm writing this review.  The only thing this restaurant can improve on would be service.  Frankly, the service during my visit was typical of service in other Indian restaurants: very curt interactions with restaurant workers who are simply there to take your order and put the food on your table.  Just embrace it for what it is.

Also, this place literally is a hole in the wall.  Don't come here expecting a fancy place.  Come here expecting great South Indian food that you typically won't find at your run of the mill Indian restaurant in town.  Oh, and come for lunch as opposed to dinner.  The value is tremendous."}
{"text":"Overrated place. It was the only Indian option around that area. I wouldn't recommend trying diverse options. Play the safe game by choosing the mundane stuff."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my wife and her care giver and again it was wonderful. Excellent service with food that was even better. The lunch menu is simple, aforable ($7-9) and filling. The spices were just right. 

Yet again a wonderful eating experience."}
{"text":"Located in Monroeville, somewhere in the middle of Old William Penn Hwy, this place looks dilapidated and dated from outside (and also from inside). However do not let the appearances fool you, the food is delicious. You get delicacies from South India and North India, though I always return for the former (as I guess the place does that food more justice). Remember this is a PURE VEGETARIAN restaurant. 

Now being an Indian and having tried authentic local food back home in India, I can say that the South Indian food they serve comes as close (in my opinion) to legit home-cooked, mouth-watering and tantalizing food that I crave. 

This is how you can optimize your experience:

Start with the Idli- Vada combo, which includes a white cake made of rice batter and is steamed (idli), and a lentil based donut that is fried (vada). This is served with a coconut chutney and sambar (something like a vegetable stew). 

Next proceed with Mixed Vegetable Pakoras - vegetables like onions, potatoes and chillies covered with a paste of gram flour and fried, served with a mint/coriander chutney. Accompany this with a glass of Mango Lassi or regular Lassi, as you please.

The next dish should be a Dosa (rice crepe) - Rava Masala, Mysore Masala, Spring Dosa, Paneer Dosa (here the Masala is a potato mixture that is filled inside the crepe and is not very spicy as the name actually suggests), or an Uttapam (thicker version of the Dosa) - Vegetable Uttapam. 

Finish off with a Filter Coffee (made with a lot of milk and instant coffee).

Now, I do not guarantee you will be able to walk after this, but I do promise you will enjoy all that you just ate.

I bid you good eating!"}
{"text":"Four of us went for lunch here on Thanksgiving day. They were open and pretty crowded. 
Appetizers ordered : 1 Chilly Pakoda, 2 Dahi vada, 1 veg cutlet
Dosas : Mysore Masala Dosa, Rava Dosa, Paneer Dosa
Drink : Salt Lassi
Result : Everyone was extremely full. 
Dosas were very satisfying, especially the Rava Dosa. Dahi Vadas were sort of sweet. We have had better Dahi vada elsewhere. Chilly Pakodas were hot. Veg Cutlet was pretty good."}
{"text":"I love Udipi. Totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"One if the best vegetarian only Indian restaurants I've been to around Pittsburgh. If you want something fun, try the bhatura - it's huge and puffy. They have a nice selection of lunch specials, and bunch of delicious options for dinner. It has the feeling of a very authentic place, Indian friends I've talked to seem to agree. Closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Are you here for the ambiance?  No.  Are you here for the sparkling repartee with the wait staff?  No...get over yourself!  You are here for the best Indian food you can get anywhere near Pittsburgh.  So cheap, so delicious, and so unforgettable your out-of-town friends will beg you to take them here when they visit.  

We always start with the chili pakora--spicy, but so flavorful I don't mind a few moments of burning.  Try it!  Then get a dosa to share.  It doesn't matter which one you choose; just make sure you use the coconut chutney that comes with it.  Over many visits, we've tried almost every dish on the menu and can safely say that, even if you close your eyes and point randomly at an entree when ordering, you won't be disappointed.  Udipi's raita is fabulous.  Drizzle a bit of it on almost any dish to magically enhance what was in no need of enhancement in the first place.  And please indulge in the bhatura!  

Do you remember those old cartoons in which characters would, literally, be lifted off their feet by a delicious aroma, carried through the air toward an irresistible feast?  That's how I feel every time I park in front of Udipi.  After your first visit, you will, too."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Atmosphere is definitely not what you come for but the vegetarian Indian food is delicious!  I've never seen such a huge Chana Bhatura!  I come here every time I come home!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp! This is now our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! They have wonderful Southern Indian cuisine. Basically, they have different types of Indian breads mixed with a variety of different fillings. They also make the usual curry dishes, but I suggest trying something different. For me, the Dosa was incredible. Based on Rachel's review, I tried the Butter Masala Dosa and WOW! It was delicious from start to finish. Our 19 month old son loved it, too! The appetizers were wonderful, too. We tried the combo to get a nice survey of the flavors and it was a winner. I didn't have the Gulab jamun, trying to show some restraint, but I'm looking forward to trying it next time. I even ended up buying a gift certificate for an Indian friend who did me a great favor recently. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews regarding service here my boyfriend and I were prepared to endure some rudeness to get some authentic Indian food. We have come here 3 times now and the staff has been great. They have been nothing but pleasant and accommodating.  Everything we have ordered has been delicious. We've tried multiple dosas, uthapam, aloo gobi, and the deluxe thali. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One might believe they'd been transported to India when visiting this modest, jam-packed restaurant located not far from the highway. We ordered the appetizer platter, mango lassi and a masala dosa. Chutney and dips were especially tasty.  It is not much further west than breezewood and this Indian home cooking offers a welcome reprieve from fast food joints."}
{"text":"All I can tell you is FINE THIS PLACE!!!!! Oh my!!! The food was soooo good I'm still talking about it! I am looking forward to putting that wonderful food back in my mouth!!!!!"}
{"text":"Go to Udipi if you are looking for authentic.  If you are looking for Vegan.  If you are looking for flavor.  Udipi is off the beaten path, but it's definitely worth finding and experiencing.  The Thali a lot of variety, really quite wonderful.  It's a great introduction to the restaurant.  I think the plain and simple decor only adds to the experience.  Note that the restaurant is closed Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Most tasteful food I have had in some time. The spices are on point and you will undoubtedly leave with a full stomach. Definitely worth a try if you have never eaten South Indian food"}
{"text":"South Indian thali is the bomb for true South Indians! I loved it. Everything was fresh and hot, and tasted authentic."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place since I had heard so many wonderful things about it. I was a bit intimidated by the menu since it had lots of different things that I wasn't familiar with...and I've eaten Indian a lot.  We ordered the assorted appetizer which was okay...the breading was very doughy.  For entrees we had vegetable curry and chick peas and spinach.  Both were very tasty.  The thing I really didn't like was the service.  They put us in the back and pretty much ignored us.  Not good. Will I be back?  The jury is out.  Maybe I should give it another chance?"}
{"text":"Arguably the worst Indian restaurant in United States!

I have been there four times so far, with a hope that the either the food or the service will get better the next time, and they have proven me wrong every time. The last time was the worst! For the real mediocre food, we had to wait 40 mins for the guy to take our order, and  another 20 to get our cheque!  We were a group of 4 from different parts of the country, and all of us unanimously agreed, the only reason this place thrives is because they are only Indian restaurant in the vicinity of the Sri Venkateswara temple in Monroeville. 

The only reason they get one star is because yelp doesn't let me do anything below that!"}
{"text":"Great food, and very cheap.  We had two terrific dishes.  Thanks, yelp, for the tip off that this place even exists.  We stopped right in the middle of an 8 hour drive, and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Udipi was about 8 months or so ago with my girlfriend and I was blown away by the food. It was the most authentic South Indian food I had tasted and I was excited to bring my mother over when she came for a visit later. The server was very accommodating and helpful and generally enhanced the experience. A few months later my girlfriend took her mother and some friends there and had a rather unpleasant experience with the service but the food was ok. I didn't think much of it at the time.  Recently when my parents were in town, we decided to give it a shot again. As some people have noted here, calling their phone number is a hit or miss and they don't even have a voicemail set up. When we actually got there and ordered our food and some drinks, we received no service. My dad had to go ask them for spare utensils and my parents were wholly unimpressed with the food and I had to agree. Their eggplant curry, a North Indian dish and okra curry, a southern variant both tasted identical. At least the okra curry had a few pieces of okra. The eggplant curry had peas but no eggplant. My mother, who hails from Kerala, a southern state in India, was not impressed with their South Indian Mysore Masala dosas. Our coffee, which was ordered with the food, never arrived and we had to have them take it off the bill at the end of the night. The place was definitely less busy than the last time I was there but somehow that made their service worse than better. Perhaps the place is under new management who are taking the place to new lows. 

My first impression of this place was a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant with better food than expected. Now it is just a hole in the wall. I am going to warn my friends about the drop in quality of this place, including unfortunately, the friends who introduced me to this place."}
{"text":"I was there was the breakfast, I loved the food but the service sucks . The manager and staff were very rude !! Food : 4.5/5
Service : 1/5."}
{"text":"Man I am swooning over this place. I cannot get enough of Udipi's. I went here twice this fall and it is not on the way to anywhere that I regularly go. This place, so I'm told, is one of the most authentic Indian restaurants in the city.

They have a very exhaustive menu. I have tried the samosas, gobi dry, masala dosai, partha, vegetable korma, channa masala, palak paneer, and aloo palak. Both times I went here we ate family style and I really think that is the right way to do it. The dishes could potentially fill one person but I think it is better to order an average of 3 dinners for every two people in your party. This allows you to try more delicious foods and who doesn't love leftovers. 

My absolute favorite dish was the palak paneer. We ordered this because our server said it was his favorite dish and man I can understand why. It is super creamy but hard to explain. It will make you wish you had more. My next favorite dish was the aloo palak. For appetizers I insist you try to gobi dry. It is technically cauliflower, but you would never know. The only dish I wouldn't order again is the samosa's. They were good but I have had better from my Indian friends. 

I am not friends with the owner but I hope to be some day because this place is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good authentic food. The outside looks very dull and the inside is pretty plain, but the food is great! They have a really big menu and everything sounded delicious. The rice course had extra sauces that were good. Would recommend the rose ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Food is good, but pricey. Wish they had a buffet. Service is slow and the place is always crowded. The servers don't like to come even after signaling for them. Last time we went the toilets were not working and people were still using them, and real dishes were replaced with paper products. I'm not planning to return."}
{"text":"Weekends can be a little busy and require some waiting. Although, the turnover is real fast. The food is stupendous and reasonably priced. Adequate space but nothing fancy in terms of decor. The food speaks for itself. The waiters are polite and responsive to customer requests. The food is authentic South Indian and there is a big variety to choose from. Would recommend the South Indian cuisine here rather than North Indian."}
{"text":"I love this place - great South Indian food!

The space is clean and inviting but sparse. Service is good but not great. Prices are really affordable. I generally prefer to get takeout from here so I can pig out on my own at home.

As for the food - it's so, so good. The idli is great and the palak paneer is also quite good. Udipi's best items are the dosas, which is different from the normal north Indian fare you get in most Indian restaurants. But it will become a craving once you've had it. Rava dosas, masala dosas and all their variants - all expertly prepared. I think I just made myself hungry writing this review!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh eating at its best. Unpretentious. Made with love. Flavor that lingers."}
{"text":"The worst indian restaurant i have ever been. I donno what does that guy in the front think of himself. 

They owe some respect to the customers.

Food used to be good few years before but not now, And don't even talk about the service. The worst service you would ever see.

Please stay away from that restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst place ever that I have visited for food. Didn't give water until 45 min of seating. After 45 min waiting, we ordered food which was left over food from previous days. Taste was too bad. People were worst in handling orders. Worst ambience.... Never again to this place...."}
{"text":"Definitively a good place to go. Yes, many places offer a buffet for almost the same price but you get for what you paid. And most of the time, buffet food is a bunch of crap. At udipi, it was definitively worth it. The food is really good, tasty, the service is fast and not too pushy. Lot of options. I will definitively come back."}
{"text":"Tasty food, great value.
It's easy to drive right by without noticing...so SLOW down when GPS says you're close. The place feels like a cafeteria at an old folks home.  The staff expects you to know what everything is and they're less than helpful in navigating a newbie. Everything I've ordered has been tasty- but I wish I had a friend that knows their way around the menu to guide me. If you don't know that person, use reviews to plan your attack.
Also, they are cash only...be prepared for that. (Take a $20 and you'll eat like royalty.)"}
{"text":"As others before me have said, the strength here is NOT the service. However, if you're in the mood to settle in for a while, put down your phone and chat with your dinner companions, and then \"ooh\" and \"aah\" over the most authentic South Indian food...you've come to the right place.

The place is great - they offer impressive portions, and this is alongside relatively cheap prices. Despite having the vibe that they might not take credit cards...they DO! Most every offering has a tasty coconut chutney and sambhar (lightly spiced lentil soup) that comes along side the main course. This is super traditional in South Indian cooking, so kudos for authenticity. 

This is a great place for people with special diets. They offer many many many lentil and chickpea flour only dishes (again, very traditional for South Indian cooking). For the friend who is vegetarian or vegan but feels like they've exhausted Pittsburgh's offerings, this would be a pretty impressive date spot. The food is authentic, having recently returned from a trip to India, I can vouch for this. The heat profile is moderate, meaning you won't be crying, but you will feel the burn with some of their dishes. Likewise, if you are sensitive to heat, you can always stick with the plethora of tasty fried lentil dishes that come with mild coconut chutney.

The downsides are mostly those that others have voiced - the poor service (which also includes that the servers aren't great at explaining dishes to you if you don't already know what you are ordering), and the iffy ambiance. I actually wasn't a giant fan of the spicing on some dishes (not the heat, the actual use of salt and spices). My concern was that they sometimes were blander than I'd hoped. Now, I will say, when you order Idli (lentil pancake), expect a gluten free version of very spongy wonder bread. This is traditional, but I was kind of unimpressed with the dish. If you soak it in coconut chutney and sambhar, though, it's pretty good.

I'll certainly be back, because the flavors are great, and there's nowhere else in the area to get this kind of food. If they just improved and tweaked some of their problem areas, this place would be a total destination."}
{"text":"By God by far this 1 beats all the desi restaurants that make South Indian food. The chef is really good & unlike other restaurants he doesn't use pre made mixes or sauces. Authentic udipi style food."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not have much of an ambience.

The south Indian dishes are among the best I've had in the US.  Fried idli is a great appetizer, and the dosai come in many tasty varieties.  If you are not familiar with south Indian cuisine, you should take note that a \"masala\" dosa means the dosa is stuffed with curried potatoes and onions.  There's a lot to try, and I definitely recommend this place for repeat visits. The chhole bature is a noteworthy non-south Indian dish, it comes with a huge fried flatbread (the bature) and curried garbanzo beans (chhole).

It gets very busy in the summer due to traffic from the nearby S.V. Temple."}
{"text":"The best And most authentic Udipi restaurant I haven been to. Authentic, light, good portions and lightly priced. Amazing. A must stop for anyone driving past especially on the highway."}
{"text":"Best Indian food within a day's drive.

Might I recommend the chana batura? Paneer dosa? And perhaps begin with the potato bonda?

Sometimes humble surroundings beget fine food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"wow in US i have not waited for nearly one hr to get my food and i wrongly got into this restaurant on the way to MD after visit to hindu temple. Dont recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"I ran into this restaurant as I drove out of SV temple & was looking for dinner, what better place than when you see something which has your home town name! Well the hospitality & the taste more than lived upto the name. Great dosa & good filter coffee, Mr.Manjunath, Thank You"}
{"text":"Fan? You say .. Of course I am.

It's a bit of a drive and somewhat of an adventure to get to this place especially for someone like me living in the south hills area. Nevertheless, the traffic (yes .. I am looking at you .. Sq. Hill Tunnel) can't keep me away from a hidden gem like Udipi.

Before this recent visit, the last time I ate here was about 11 years ago. Thanks Yelp for the reminder! This place has more of a cafeteria setting and doesn't have the fanciest decor or furnishings. However, the place looks clean and the food ... very authentic and simply delicious. Also, the servers aren't the friendliest and you might have a hard time communicating with them since some of the server hardly spoke english. But we knew what we were ordering. And if you're like me - I usually gaze over what others are eating (which my gf hates) which may or may not help you order if you're unfamiliar with the dish.

Definitely, one of the best places to eat in the burgh."}
{"text":"People were extremely friendly, nice atmosphere, fast service and most importantly absolutely delicious food."}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical before I came in here as ratings were below 4. Came here with family and ordered Avial which was served with rice, mysore sada dosa and poori channa.

We liked all of the above items and in fact Avial was made home style. I would recommend this place for some one looking for a good South Indian eatery."}
{"text":"Small and popular vegetarian cafe in suburban Pittsburgh. It's a very small place and they don't take reservations. But the quality has been great and has maintained itself for a very long time. South Indian veggie items are the speciality and the service is pretty quick. There is limited parking in this place so sometimes it does get crowded."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian Food. I thought their vegetarian options were great. Delicious flavor and very affordable. Friendly service too. We tried a variety of options and we were impressed by every one."}
{"text":"I HAVE to eat at this place everytime I head towards Monroeville! On the outside it appears shabby & dilapidated. I remember being afraid to set foot inside during my first visit... But once in, all thoughts of fleeing are instantly replaced by thoughts of how much more of this amazing food can I stuff into myself!!

Udipi cafe specializes in South Indian street food but they also serve several North Indian dishes ( pakoras, Chana batura etc). I usually stick with the dosas which are truly crisp & as close as u can get to eating the same dish in India. Of the dosas, I love the paneer & rava masala dosas. 

A must try is the filter coffee!! A traditional hot drink from South India, this specialty instant coffee will be exactly what you need to round up your meal!"}
{"text":"Really good vegetarian indian food. Atmosphere and service isn't great, but the food is really good"}
{"text":"If you, like myself, have read the reviews on this place and have never really strayed from the creamy and undeniable Northern-style curries that dominate the Indian food scene in Pittsburgh (and everywhere else in this country), you may have some high expectations for Udipi.  So when I finally dragged a group out here to Monroeville to try some South Indian cuisine for the first time, I was excited see what the hype was all about.

Between the 5 of us, we tried the PAPER MASALA DOSA, a PANEER DOSA, an ONION & PEAS UTHAPPAM, a VEGETABLE UTHAPPAM, a SOUTH INDIAN THALI, a plain BHATURA, and a round of MASALA CHAIS and COFFEE.  Udipi's strength clearly lies in its carbier offerings, as the dosas, uthappams, and bhaturas were enjoyed by all, with the SAMBHAR and COCONUT CHUTNEY as flavorful accompaniments.  Some crispy dough, some creamy filling, plus a savory sweet dip make for a perfect bite.  The paneer filling didn't sing like I would have hoped--the flavor fell flat and it was a strange texture that was more mushy than anything else, but wrapped inside its dosa shell, it was perfect tasty anyway.

The thali was the biggest miss for me.  I honestly couldn't assign every dish to its name, but the only ones I really enjoyed were the RASAM and a sticky rice garnished with dried fruit.  The rasam was so wonderfully spiced and aromatic, I committed to another side order, and the sticky rice was toothsome and fragrant.  The PORIYAL was tasty enough, as was the ubiquitious SAMBHAR, but I mostly left the rest of the savory dishes and the PICKLES, as well as the PAYASAM, which I had been excited to try as I love milky desserts, but just didn't care for the flavoring of.  I like soft breads, so the CHAPATI and the PAPADUM just weren't my thing, and Udipi's versions were no exceptions.

The chais tasted sinfully creamy, almost too much so to sip, and my tiny cup was gone in minutes.  It would be great if they would offer refills, as the cups are so small for their price.  I enjoyed the creamy coffee as well, though it was a bit too indulgent for my black coffee-loving husband.

In total, our Saturday lunch was an adventurous and flavorful meal and well worth the trek as first-timers, though I ultimately much prefer the aloo gobis and korma dishes that I find much more satisfying.  I wish I had ordered a quart of the rasam to go, as I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Udipi Cafe is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh, but they still don't deserve a five star rating. Let me explain why. 

Udipi is a pure vegetarian restaurant and I have  been to Udipi a few times. The food is fantastic. They would definitely get five stars for that. One of my favorite items is the mirchi Bhajji (chili pakoda). As a warning to fellow spicy food lovers, They're extremely hot. Their dosas are also amazing. The spicy andhra Dosa, rava Dosa, and mysore Dosa are my favorites. All dosas come in a masala version as well, which contain mashed potatoes inside the Dosa. I've tried their north Indian dishes as well, but they're not as good as the south indian ones. There are other places where north Indian food is better. South Indian food is udipi's forte. 

Price wise it's fantastic as well. Each of these dosas cost less than $10, but is a full meal. The appetizers are in the zone of $5. 

The ambience is not so great. The bright white light inside doesn't help. The seating area is fairly cramped. There are a few booths with couches, but the chairs otherwise are not very comfortable. Service is very unlike other restaurants. There is no dedicated server for one table. Different waitstaff took our order, gave water glasses, gave the appetizers, and each of the main course dishes. We had to ask for water repeatedly before someone gave us some.

This place gets full score for the food, but is below par for service and ambience."}
{"text":"Try to go here in between meal times when rarely anyone is there. I've been here four times over an year. I went during busy dinner time once, I wanted to cry and scream because of such bad and slow service. And when the food finally came out, I wanted to take it to my car in the parking lot and eat it. After that, I've went in between 3-5pm. Service was much faster obviously because there was less customers. Food is pretty descent. I would give 3.5 stars but rounded up!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try this place. Oh you don't like Indian food? Try it as this is South Indian and is hard to find. Oh you are a carnivore? This place has way more flavor than any steakhouse out there. Um you don't like spicy food? Just tell them that, they will hook you up and you will thank me later. Udipi offers surprisingly fantastic food at a cheap price in an extremely obscure locale."}
{"text":"I would rate Udipi as a 3 1/2 because of its very basic set up. Keeping it basic probably helps them keep the cost down and that is why the prices are pretty reasonable. It's apparently an old and popular establishment for authentic vegetarian South Indian food. The idli (steamed rice cake) and vada (fried lentil savory donuts) are pretty good and come with a side of coconut chutney and spicy sambhar. The dosas (rice and lentil batter crepes) are really good as well. Also, worth trying is their dahi vada, although on the sweeter side, it is still flavorful. The service is decent, but can be slow if the restaurant is full. Come for the food and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Udipi is definitely worth the trip off of the beaten path. If getting off the beaten path is not enough of an excuse for you, let me be the eleventh to tell you how great the food is: Udipi serves some of the best cuisine I've ever had the pleasure to taste. The samosas are near perfect and served with hari (green) and meethhi (tamarind) chutneys that must be blessed by Annapurna, as I can offer no other explanation as to why they were so much better than your typical Indian condiment offerings. Aloo Gobi and Baingan Bartha are two of my favorite dishes and though it is hard for me to stray, I am eager to try other things on the menu. I believe that Udipi takes great care in preparing food, as if it all should be fit for prasada . Eat like a deva but accept your fate of eternal samsara, as the kama of dining at Udipi will keep you coming back for more. 

Notes on the service: The service was just as service should be -- just plain service. Our main server had a most pleasant smile. They leave a pitcher of water for you at the table, so that you may refill as needed (I like that). There were several children dining in the restaurant while we were there with whom the employees established very friendly rapport. 

My apologies for any inaccurate allusions to Hinduism."}
{"text":"As a South Indian from Udupi area , I must say the dosa was good . But the service was horrible . May be it was because on a Labor Day weekend ,but the waiters and the owners themselves were very dismissive and  wanted to get rid of us . And it wasn't completely filled too . 

The restrooms were so horrible that my parents did not even enter it to wash their hands ."}
{"text":"I have had south Indian food at many places but never had something close to this.  Udupi is EXCELLENT...I say it brings authentic south Indian flavors to Pennsylvania... Must go ...especially for DOSAS"}
{"text":"This place is my family's go-to dining spot. It's an all veg South Indian restaurant, which is great for me (and even my dad who always wants meat likes it). They have tons of yummy dosas (their masala one is awesome) and chana bhattura and samosas and idli and a bunch of other things. The portions are tremendous - you can easily share an app and entree. The ambience is like a school cafeteria, but it's clean and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"This has historically been my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately I eat a diet that isn't compatible with the carb-heavy S. Indian diet, but that doesn't change the fact that I will occasionally cheat and have a good meal here, and I will never stop praising it!

There is no 'atmosphere', unless you count the fact that it looks like your average restaurant in Chennai. It's clean, spartan diner booths, and up until a couple years ago didn't even use silverware (plastic forks and paper napkins in a cup at every table). But the food is what makes this restaurant amazing.

My favorite dish is the vegetable pullao, which is a mixture of rice and vegetables with spices served with raita. All of the dosas (big thin crepes) are wonderful, and it's difficult to choose a favorite-- you can't really go wrong. All of the chutneys are amazing, though the hari (green cilantro chutney) is the best in my opinion. The curries are good, too, but definitely not the strong point of the restaurant.

Udipi has some of the best appetizers around. The best thing to do is order the appetizer sampler and share it with someone-- the combination of samosas, onion pakora (like onion rings), potato pakora, chili pakora, etc. is deep fried heaven. The idli are a healthier option, and they're always cooked to perfection. Light and fluffy and filling.

The food is very cheap and high quality. The waitstaff might seem a little gruff at first, but they're all really great, friendly people whom I've gotten to know over the years. Be prepared to wait if you choose to go during peak hours on weekends, after temple or during Hindu holidays. During off hours, there is never a wait, but I have waited up to an hour for a table during peak times. 

Make sure to check out the Indian goods import store, Shingar, next door for Bollywood films to rent or purchase, saris, beautiful jewelry and religious decor."}
{"text":"Y'know what? I'm not sure that this place lives up to the hype.  The location is a bit odd, which isn't really a problem, but I dunno... I've never left Udipi feeling that my life has been changed.

What I can say is that Udipi is different from any other Indian place in the area, as far as I can tell.  This is its selling point: I'm definitely glad Udipi is there, because you wouldn't get those dishes elsewhere.  And some of them are really interesting! 

But interesting is sort of where it stopped for me.  I didn't have anything where I was blown away by the flavor.  I believe it took us a long time to get served, too.

The décor is sort of dated-looking.  That's not a big deal, though... we were there for the food.

Udipi could be better."}
{"text":"Kinda have some mixed feelings about this place. The wait was long and they took like forever to take down our order. To be honest they are not at all organized and I saw only one person taking down the orders and the other delivering it to the table. So I wasn't expecting good service. If anyone knows udipi cuisine, they would know how good is the Sambhar with its sweet notes. But the Sambhar was way too sweet. And the Avial was like the Thai green curry and it was OK. The only good part was the Dosa and Uthappam. Dining in this restaurant basically a YMMV experience."}
{"text":"Rava masala dosa was great.  Saag paneer was average.  Paratha was not very good.  Masala chai was way over priced for a small cup at $3.50.  This is a good place to eat after visiting the temple since its only about a mile away.  But for food and ambiance I'd not make the trip here.  It is good for strict vegetarians since they do not serve any meat here."}
{"text":"I have only had the chance to dine here once, however, it was pretty awesome. We dined in a group of 4 and it was nice because we ate family style and got to experience several different dishes. Be advised all the dishes Udipity serves are vegetarian."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Indian food or want to taste really well cooked Indian fare, this is the place to go.  Food is great and service is very polite and pleasant.  The dining room clean and simply decorated in Indian style.  Servers are not pushy, but it is easy to catch a server's eye.  They always respond.  Also, servers are good at explaining the dishes to those unfamiliar with Indian fare.  

I find this restaurant delightful!  And the cost is very reasonable.  I wish there were more of them!"}
{"text":"Traveling in the area for business and found this gem on Yelp. The reviews were accurate, little atmosphere, but excellent quality food and well prepared. Since I wasn't familiar with this style I followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers. I had the Paneer Marsala that came with white rice and small sides. I didn't like the Chapatis bread, it was too plain, but just think that was a bad choice. I have other Indian breads before and just didn't remember what I had ordered. I come though this area a couple times a year and will try again when I am back next. I would bring wine or beer with me next time."}
{"text":"It's out of the way with nothing else of interest nearby. its ambiance is nothing to write home about, nor is the service (not that they're bad, just unremarkable). 

What Udipi offers, though, is some damn fine S. Indian food. And that is what compels us to make the 30 minute pilgrimage again and again. Love the dosas, and I can never have just one of their mango lassis."}
{"text":"I have read reviews and researched were I could find the best Indian food in the area and Udipi Cafe is definitely it!!!! Everything is freshly made and flavorful. This is true real deal Indian food."}
{"text":"Had some delicious vegetarian Indian food here, including:

- Rava Dosa (cream of wheat and lentil crepe with onion and chiles)
- Palak paneer (spinach and cheese cooked with tomatoes and fresh Indian spices)
- Bhatura (large puffy bread deep fried)
- Gulab Jamun dessert (dry milk and cottage cheese balls, deep fried and soaked in saffron and honey syrup) - similar concept to Asian dessert dumplings

I don't think our waiter said more than five words to us (and nothing at all when he came to our table to take our order), which was odd, but we got our food and correct bill.  And I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were when we were done.  I would recommend everything from my list above - we got a variety of things that I had never seen offered at other Indian restaurants (well, except for the palak paneer - I've seen that many places)."}
{"text":"To begin, as a vegetarian, if there are more than 5 options on a menu for me to choose from, they get an automatic half star bonus in my book. This place doesn't need the half star. I'm basing my review entirely off the food as I've never had any reason to rave or to complain about the completely adequate service. I've never, ever been disappointed with anything I've ordered. The Batura (puffy bread) is amazing! 
If you are looking for a higher end place with service that falls over itself to cater to your every need, this isn't the place for you. It's always busy, but we've always gotten a table reasonably fast. A server has always been prompt to take our order and the food has always come out quickly and just as ordered. Service has never been bad, but it's never more than the basic necessities of \"What do you want, here's what you ordered, and was everything ok, do you need anything else?\" The place is divey, but the food is so good.
If you like Indian food, get your butt here."}
{"text":"Placed in the middle of nowhere, Udipi was great. We went in there for dinner and there was a huge crowd. We had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, and it was obvious that they were desperate to turn the tables around really quickly; however, we never felt rushed or hurried.

My fiance and I shared a Mysore Masala Dosa and Chole Batura, both of which were excellent. I also ordered a Sweet Lassi which was as good as the ones we get in India. We also ordered a bowl of Gulab Jamun, which were tasty but had a little too much cardamom in it for my taste. Don't except fine dining from this place though. The place was clean but it was nothing fancy what so ever. I am definitely going back there. :)"}
{"text":"I'm sure all their food is good, but since they specialize in South Indian food, that's all I've ever ordered there.  Favorites are Masala Dosai and Samber. 

My daughter and I go there every once in a while when I've craving spicy food."}
{"text":"Great for dosa. The masala in the dosa is not all that great. Sambar and rasam and coconut chutney are really great. Their appetizer sampler plate is super awesome. I haven't have such great mirchi bhaji and vegetable cutlet in any other Indian food place. Their poori and sabzi and Chana masala are okay, but j would recommend these ( the Poori drips oil). I love their dahi vada and the Falooda, filter coffee, tea and mango lassi is absolutely yum."}
{"text":"The Dosa Nazi!

You've heard of the Soup Nazi from Seinfield, right? Well, here's the south Indian version. 

HORRIBLE SERVICE
No other way to describe this. Often rude, never a smile, often having to wait very long to be seated or for order to be taken. No eye contact in-case you wanted to ask for something. Unfriendly.

BELOW AVERAGE AMBIANCE
It's like they did not even TRY to tidy up the place and give it a bit of a shine. Oh well. 

GOOD FOOD
People however come to Udipi because of the food. Mind you, it's not great south Indian food - I've had better. But it's very good, and perhaps worth the visit despite the comments above. I wish the delicacies were made in a healthier manner (better/ less oil etc). The prices are reasonable and that may be another reason people keep coming back. The location is also ideal for many south Asians who may be in the area because of the proximity to the beautiful temples. 

Will Udipi ever improve their service and ambiance? I doubt it. They probably do not have a NEED to. I wish they did though. It's too bad."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Masala dosa did not have a lot of stuffing in it but the masala tea was really good.  The fried foods were a little overdone.  Service was really good and food arrived quickly.  May visit again and reevaluate this review."}
{"text":"Taste is all fine, but their customer service sucks. Had called to order a To-go on a Saturday night. Someone answered, he was a rude saying they close by 9 PM itself (actual close time was 10). Then before ordering,  he asked me to wait & put me on hold. After a min or so, that guy disconnected the call simply. I called again and someone finally took the order. Since this was the only Vegetarian only restaurant in the area, I had to order something from this place for my kid n parents. 
If given an option, I definitely wud not have ordered here."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! They have a large menu with tons of vegetarian opens. I got the gobi manchurian which was amazing. Looking forward to trying more food there. We went on a Friday night and the place was pretty busy. A little outdated interior but doesn't matter to me cause the food was amazing!! Highly recommend it, even for non-Indian food loving people."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a pretty obscure place if you're not familiar with the Monroeville area (outside of the Mall). But if you can find this wonderful gem, Udipi will leave your tummy satisfied and your taste buds stimulated. This is a very authentic no frills Southern Indian restaurant. The food is awesome! The first time I went, I liked it okay, but was not completely sold. Now that I've been back a few times, I am hooked. You have to find your meal here. I usually go with some friends, so we order a few things and go family style. 

Here are our selections if you're daunted by the menu.

Appetizers: Vegetable Cutlet, Vegetable Somosas
Dosa: go for the Masala Dosa if you're unsure
Entrees: Palak Paneer, Alu Gobi
Rice: Coconut Rice - it's awesome!

And go to town, and try other things. As the other reviews have said, this place is really a great bargain!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Udipi Cafe I've ever been to. The service was horrible and the food was just OK. The restaurant wasn't clean. We waited for 10 mins to order the dessert but nobody took our order. Never going there again."}
{"text":"I have the authority to legitimately rate this place and for people to weigh my opinion more than others.  Why, you ask...b/c I'm South Indian and have grown up with South Indian food my entire life.  It's near impossible to get authentic South Indian food at most Indian places as most of them serve North Indian food (there is a distinction).  And while most if not all Indians agree, you don't get the best made South Indian food cooked by a North Indian and vice versa. 

Although I will have to say that my mom makes the best South Indian food, Udipi comes a close second.  So I highly recommend this place to people who enjoys Indian food but wants to venture out of the standard North Indian cuisine (naan, chicken tikka, etc.).  The dosas and channa batura are delicious along with the medhu vada.  And as I mentioned earlier, it would be a crime to order North Indian dishes from this place so stick with their South Indian dishes and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Authentic south Indian cafe. If you are not used to strong indian flavors go with sense of adventure.

For any indian origin...pure soul food."}
{"text":"Hands on the food this is the best indian place in Pittsburgh. It's south indian so expect a ton of vegetarian options. Most of them not exactly light but all of them delicious. Try a mysore dosa (sort of a crepe filled with potatoes and spices)!

On weekend nights it gets really busy so you're better off putting an order in and doing take out."}
{"text":"Worst customer service!!! I recommend everyone better not to go this place!!! Worst management ever I have seen!!! I have waited for 1 hour and After asking 3 times they told they missed my order."}
{"text":"Great South Indian vegetarian food at good prices.

Today I enjoyed a spicy Rasam (soup) followed by a Mysore dosa.

The dosa was crisp and hot filled with spiced potato.   The dosa cane with sambar and coconut chutney.

Low key surroundings with pleasant staff.  Seems a great place for families with children."}
{"text":"This is on my list of the top 5 restaurants in Pittsburgh.

The food is simple. The atmosphere is low-rent and unassuming. It's not fancy, it's just simple southern Indian cooking with incredible dosa and idli at reasonable prices.

Deducting 1 star because the bathrooms are not as clean as they should be (but this is more a result of the building being really old than anything else, IMO)."}
{"text":"If you want the most delicious Indian food in (or outside) of Pittsburgh, this is the place to go. Nothing fancy inside or outside the building, but don't let appearances fool you. Lots of choices and great for vegetarians (as Indian food usually is)."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"don't judge a book by its cover\" restaurants. Our friends suggested meeting here for dinner, and since we love Indian food, we were game for trying it. But when we first pulled up to the nondescript building located on a dark street in Monroeville, we thought maybe our friends hadn't actually invited us there for dinner, but instead to murder us and dump our bodies.

The inside of this place doesn't look much better than the outside. It is reminiscent of an 80's cafeteria and we were hit with a strong smell of cleaning chemicals when we first walked in. So needless to say, this did not appear like it would be a tasty eatery upon first impression.

But -- surprise -- it IS in fact a delicious restaurant! It's Southern Indian and all vegetarian. We ordered several dishes and ate family style. 

We started with the appetizer sampler -- a huge platter of goodies, including a samosa, several kinds of pakodas (fried veggies -- onion, chili pepper), an onion-y donut-like thing (I forget what it was called), steamed lentil cakes, and several kinds of chutneys (coconut, cilantro and tamarind). I LOVED the samosa -- it probably was the best I've ever had. It was packed with tons of flavorful veggies, a crispy shell, and not too greasy. The pakodas were delectable, though to be fair, it's pretty easy to win me over with anything fried. I wasn't a huge fan of the lentil cakes -- they were a bit bland. The tastiness factor of the goodies was enhanced by the chutneys. I was partial to the cilantro chutney (it had a bit of a kick to it, which I love) and the coconut chutney (I could drink that stuff by the cupful!)

For our meals, we ordered two dosas (paper dosa and spring dosa) and two curries (aloo matar and another whose name is escaping me, but it had potatoes and little veggie balls). It was notable that they did not ask for a spice level for any of the dishes -- other Indian restaurants that I frequent let you choose how hot you'd like it. Because of this, the food in general was not as spicy as I would have preferred -- the dishes we ordered were definitely geared towards a tamer spice palette.

Lack of spiciness notwithstanding, everything we ordered was really delicious! My favorite was definitely the paper dosa. This was a burrito-type monstrosity with wrapping that is thin and crispy, kind of like a crepe. It was stuffed with a creamy potato and onion mixture, served with coconut chutney and sambar soup. The spring dosa was also yummy, consisting of a soft tortilla-like bread that housed a flavorful mixture of onions and other veggies. Our entree curries were outstanding as well. The aloo matar was a mix of potatoes and peas in a tomato-y curry sauce. It was slightly sweet, slightly acidic and very flavorful -- I was not shy about dousing the rice with tons of the curry sauce! The other entree was also quite delicious, with veggie balls and potatoes swimming in curry sauce with a flavor quite similar to that of the aloo matar. 

The value here was stellar too -- we had more than enough food for the four of us (two dosas, two entrees, a huge appetizer platter, and two mango lassies to drink) and it only cost about $50 total. Overall, we loved our meal and will definitely be back, despite its dank location on murder lane."}
{"text":"Been to this place more then 10 times and always the same standard. Simple setup small mom and pop type shop. The food is very authentic and tasty but I would recommend at the end of your meal to get the famous madras filter coffee! Over all a great experience."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about the food and when I drive by it appears busy with all the cars in the lots. The food was good.  But since I'm not an expert on southern Indian food I can't say it was any better than other Indian restaurants I've been to.  What I can agree with others is the lack of service and ambience.   I assume they make a profit but they don't spend it on air conditioning, seating, tables, ceiling.  Just not comfortable to enjoy the quality food."}
{"text":"Got to buck the trend here.

If I had to pick a favorite ethnic food Indian would be it. When I lived I Los Angeles we tried over 50 different restaurants and even went to India on a professional two week culinary tour of the country. So with this background and the glowing reviews that fellow yelpers and other culinary site's have given to Udipi we set off on with grand expectations for the food.

When we first entered the restaurant it was 80% full - all with Indian's and not a single Caucasian in the place - that's a very good sign in my book. During our whole meal only 3 other non-Indian people came in and they were all brought in by Indians. What can to go wrong we thought?

We ordered the assorted Appetizer plate, the idli was authentic and good and I like the sambar that was served it. The medhu vada was very plain and rather uninspiring it lacked any ginger, pepper, etc and was not good. We had Onion pakora and green bean pakora, their pakora batter was the most tasteless pakora batter I have ever had - also all of the fired items tasted like old grease that had been used to fry multiple different items so there was taste carry over.  The last but not least in the vegetable samosa which had a bland but unusually tough pastry. The inside was good and this had some flavor if you ate alone, however it was very greasy. Both the meethhi and hari chutney were very good.

For our entrees I had the onion masala dosai. The dosa was slightly undercooked so you could still taste the fermenting rice and urad. The potato filling was okay but needed more seasoning. We also had the aloo matar, a favorite of ours and an easy way to compare various Indian restaurants. While it was good, it again lacked the complex flavors and was generally under-spiced. To eat it alone was good, but if you pared it with rice the dish was pretty tasteless.

Don't get the idea that the food was bad, or inedible, it wasn't, however it was a very average for a style of cooking that is pretty easy to make very good. I will be in Pittsburgh for several months; hopefully this is not the best of the Burgh!"}
{"text":"The proper south Indian restaurant with legit food. I have tried the southIndian thali and the dosas here. It's the closest you can get to south Indian food in the USA. To go with all the idlis, dosas and chutneys, there is either masala chai or filter coffee south Indian style which i love to the core.

One must try this place out if the area for sure"}
{"text":"Zero coutesy at all... no respect to customers
Food was neither fresh nor tasty
Poor hygiene 

Never again in lifetime"}
{"text":"This place does not look particularly inviting from outside, and even inside it's a bit run-down, but I was pleasantly surprised. We came here for the vegan options, of which there were many, and the servers were knowledgeable about all the dishes. We got a veggie appetizer sampler plate and it included a few things I had never tried before, all very tasty. Our main dishes were also good, channa masala and malai kofta (for the non-vegans in the group). I can't say it was exceptional relative to other restaurants I've been to, but was all fine. They are also very kid-friendly. The servers comfortably chatted and even played a little with my kids."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  Lousy food and bad attitude of the server.    Half of us after coming back to the hotel are having an upset stomach."}
{"text":"The place is very much hidden from the main street, its an easy find on the way back from the temple. I had the mysore dosa, which was pretty spicy. Its the best dosa i had, but definitely good. They have lunch specials M-F, with the dosa and vada costing you around $7.99. Not bad at all. Good food, good price, ok service."}
{"text":"If u want to have authentic South Indian then udipi is the place. It has soothing ambience. The staff is cordial. Service is quick...
Idli was soft, plain Andhra dosa was spicy n awesome.., rava masala dosa was crispy. But the coconut chutney was not up to the mark. That disappointed. 

We ordered faluda, it was too yummy ..and colorful too..."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and they are consistent in their delicious Indian cuisine! The chefs are excellent. I highly recommend the gobi Manchurian."}
{"text":"Amazing! I felt that the food and the plating was right on point...reminded me of my visits to India. The service was very casual, if you are looking for 5 star service and always checking in then go to a fancy establishment but if you want a relaxed and limited interruption lunch/dinner this is a great place. 

I would highly recommend this place for those that love Indian food or those looking to experience it for the first time."}
{"text":"Really, really good authentic southern Indian food. 
This rivals the food that I'd get from my neighbors way back when, so this really struck a nostalgic chord in me. 

We had the Batura, Baigan Bharatha (eggplant) , and Bhindi Masala (okra).  I loved all of it, though I wish I had gotten a dosai. The dishes were perfectly spicy and creamy with sides of basmati rice, pickle, and yogurt.  It was so filling I was satisfied for two meals. 

The only complaint? I wasn't happy with our service, I had it confirmed with my friend who had went to the temple and stopped here for lunch.  The service was slllowwww, I would have brought a book if I had known it would take so long."}
{"text":"Almost as soon as I arrived in Pittsburgh a year ago, I heard that Udipi Cafe was like some sort of secret speakeasy for excellent (South) Indian food. Well I finally made it out to Monroeville with some friends, and let me tell you, Udipi did not disappoint. We ordered the fried vegetables (not greasy), aloo gobi (curried potatoes), dal makhani (curried lentils), tomato and pea uthappam (like a pancake with veggies cooked in), a spring dosa (veggies), and a masala dosa (potatoes). Personally, I am not a fan of dosa, but I would definitely go back for the uthappam. Nobody missed having meat in their dishes. Nothing was too spicy that it couldn't be enjoyed, especially with a sip of mango lassi. You guys, my sweat literally smelled like curry for two days after eating here--Udipi is the real deal!"}
{"text":"We've had Udipi three times now, and I still think it's delicious, but for some reason I hesitate to give it the full five stars!  I feel weird, like I'm missing something - I love Indian food and Udipi does it well, but for 5-stars I want a place to knock my freakin' socks off with regularity.  Udipi makes great food every time, and the Paneer Makhani DOES knock my socks off, but I guess I'm just a picky Yelper.  I think my problem is that I haven't tried the dosas or the other South Indian fare yet.  I'm guessing that ordering channa masala, palak paneer, bhindi masala, and channa palak is cheating and missing out on the full Udipi experience.  Fine, next time I'll get a dosa.

But we've enjoyed everything we tried - despite the channa masala not being my favorite - I think the paneer dishes are especially good.  The Paneer Makhani isn't on the takeout menu for some reason, but it's on the dine-in menu and they know what it is, so ask for it when you call!"}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant I've visited anywhere up and down the East Coast.

The service is unremarkable, the decor is plain at best, and the location is out of the way for those living in the 'Burgh.   Those are the \"cons.\"

Here comes the \"PRO\":  the cuisine is South Indian, which means vegetarian and football-sized dosas (FYI, most Indian restaurants have a more Northern bent, so expect this menu to be different from the norm.)  As an omnivore with strongly carnivorous tendencies, I was skeptical at first (this was years ago), but I am a South Indian cuisine convert, thanks to Udipi.  The helpings are generous, the seasonings are well-balanced.  

For appetizers, I enjoyed the chili pekora.  For the entree, the rava masala dosa was my calling.  (My mouth is watering just writing this...)  I seldom deviated from these items, despite my best intentions, so you can say that the sample size for this review is, ahem, embarrassingly big.

Enjoy this treasure of South Indian cuisine!  Udipi, I salute you!"}
{"text":"This is not the first time I've come to Udipi, and trust me, I don't always find myself tucked into a random town near Pittsburgh. I first tried Udipi a year ago and loved it. The food was mind blowing, authentic. The service (or slight lack thereof) was also authentic. And the prices were great. So no surprise, I asked my friend that we have to come back here the next time I was in town, and that we did. 

There is nothing on the menu I wouldn't recommend, basically you can have anything you want and it will be authentic, so it's more up to what you'd like to have in your dosas and whatnot. Keep in mind this is a vegetarian place. The chana batura is one of their highlights because it comes as this GIANT puffed thing and is really fun to photograph. I got the spring dosa which was promptly inhaled. If you are able to make the trip out here, I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was my second time dining at Udipi Cafe. We had friends visiting from  NJ and my husband was really excited to take them here, as Udipi Cafe served authentic Indian food, and since 2 of my friends are Indian, would appreciate it and also help recommend what foods to order. 

When one of my friends heard the name Udipi Cafe, he immediately told us it was a chain restaurant and that UC's food was not very good, mediocre to say the least. 

We still went, and 3 of us ordered the Chana Bhatura, which was a large puffy bread served with chick peas curry garnished with onions. I thought the whole thing was very tasty and filling, the puffy bread is brought out as a fried pastry with air filled in it, like a soccer ball, and deflates within a couple of minutes. I also recommended my husband to try the paper masala dosa, since I had it the week before in NJ and it was delicious. The dosa was not as huge as the 3 ft long one I had in NJ, but my husband enjoyed very much as well. I thought the sambhar that was served with the dosa was a little too sweet though. The mango lassi was also very good, though I did not have it this time, my friend finished the whole drink within minutes, because it was so good, she couldn't stop drinking it. 

Service was great, and our waiter was very nice. Will definitely be coming back to try their other stuff."}
{"text":"Service sucks. We walked in a minute before the opening time of the restaurant and were greeted by a very sarcastic host (probably the owner) - we just asked whether they're open and he responded with \"what does the sign say outside\"
One of my friends order did not come in until the rest of us were done and that too after reminding them that we were missing an order
Most of the items on the menu are really good
Giving 2 stars for the good food and the free entertainment that we got due to the lousy service (inside jokes mainly :D)"}
{"text":"You should probably do a little googling on vegetarian Indian dishes because the menu isn't much help but if you're like me and just randomly choose something you could be pleasantly surprised. This place isn't much on the side of the road, however; it's a hidden gem. AMAZING vegetarian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Udipi Cafe!! Love it!

I have been coming here for over 2 decades now and I have not had a bad exp. yet! The food here is top notch, the only mark against it is sometimes the service and decor. , but its a 7/10 service not 2/10... 

Udipi had the triffetica, Great food! Awesome prices! and a true authentic feel! Its a win-win-win!

I highly highly recommend the dosa's they are top notch!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food at this little family run hole in the wall and definitely worth the drive to Monroeville.  I'm not vegetarian but the food is so delicious that I didn't mind the lack of meat options.  My friend and I split a dosa and a saag paneer and both were delicious.  They provide several different kinds of dosa--I didn't realize there were so many varieties!  Decor was plain and simple but comfortable.  Staff were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Whoa.

Seriously.

Whoa!

This place is hands down my favorite Indian place of all time in the U.S.!

They make Southern Indian, which means dosas, utapams, idli, sambar, rasam and so much more.

This is usually the first place I visit when I land in Pittsburgh.  Going there is effectively a ritual and a delicious ceremony.

I inevitably end up ordering a gluttonous amount suitable for 2-3 people and every time the waiter looks at me questioningly with his eyes silently asking me if I know what I'm doing as he jots down my order on his worn notepad.

This place has my favorite dining aesthetic of all: old and worn cafeteria design with no frills tables and chairs, a few weathered posters of Indian gods and goddesses, a self serve pitcher of water at every table and home cooking arriving on a timely basis to your table that will quite frankly knock your socks off.

I get the special rava masala dosa which is a feat to behold, and a passion to devour. 

This is Southern Indian cuisine at it's finest and for that Udipi is always worth the trip out to Monroeville, 15 minutes outside of Pittsburgh, which I otherwise almost definitely would never have heard of or visited."}
{"text":"Totally love this place!! Cosy ambience, amazing food, friendly staff. My personal favorite is the idli vada combo . Its become my weekly must have. If you are in Pittsburgh, you must check out this place."}
{"text":"Sought this place out because it had been described as one of not the best Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Wow, the others must be dirt. I ordered the Chana Masala and it was bland and swimming in ghee. The naan was from a freezer. The salty lassi I ordered was 80% sea water, fat free yogurt and a straw. The chutney was from a jar. At many places I'd be fine with all of this; however, this is supposed to be the best? Either I tried on a really really off day, or the Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh must be the sub basement of Indian dining in America. This was a real let down. As for the service = Poor. We sat for nearly ten minutes before someone served us and when they did they made no effort to explain the specials, inquire if we wanted something beyond water and appeared to be disturbed to be waiting a table. Once we ordered the food did arrive promptly, but after we were both clearly done we sat waiting for someone to ask if we needed take out boxes. Finally, we had to wait for an additional ~minutes for our checks to arrive and they were wrong. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review of my favorite Indian restaurant previously.  I have been eating here for several years now and maybe I just took it for granted that I had shouted it from the roof tops seeing how I can't stop telling people about the place.  This is the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Period.  Don't even bother to write me about the others, been there done them.  Sure, it's apples and oranges a bit as they others are not Southern Indian at all. 

This place is out of the way and there isn't what anyone would call ambiance.  I don't give a hoot.  Order a dose, some channa bhatura and maybe some vegetable korma.  I like the veg cutlets too.  I've ordered more than 1/2 the menu and rarely have an easy time deciding what to get.  Sometimes I order a dozen items to go to settle it and eat them the next day or freeze them.  

I eat Indian food all over the country.  This is one of my very favorite places anywhere for this cuisine and I highly recommend you go and check it out."}
{"text":"I don't like eating Indian food out, because I prefer momma's home cookin', but I will gladly go to Udipi Cafe! The food is soooooo good."}
{"text":"Feels authentic, food is delicious and vegetarian. We who are fans of Indian food are discovering many new dishes here. Loved the Rasam, a spicy soup, the Potato Bonda was excellent and the Dosai were a treat, particularly the Mysore Masala Dosai."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place a 5-star rating, but leaving it with a 4-ish since I didn't have the opportunity to truly witness the glory of this place. 

Well, as soon as you enter, there is that nice welcoming smell of food that reminds you of back home. They have a tad long menu and between the four of us that visited from Rochester, I can say we managed to taste at least 1/4 th of it and loved every bit. I wouldn't recommend a specific food dish here since everything is based off what the person wants to eat at the time, but the coffee/tea (heck! both!), you definitely need to have it once - I'd have them over Starbucks every time if it was here. 


Lastly, I tried the falooda here (huge fan! force my mom to make it almost everyday I go visit India) - didn't quite like the taste here. There were some ingredients missing I think. 

Overall, definitely a good place for authentic South Indian food if you have the taste buds for it."}
{"text":"Good restaurant not so great service. This is my second time here, and on both the occasions I have enjoyed my food. Pleased with the tasty food they serve here. Chana Baturra this time around was very delicious. The size of the Baturra just blew my mind away. You can tell they don't try to make it spicy or colorful but rather focus on the taste. My family ordered, Rava Masala Dosa and Tomato Onion Uttapam, which had a great consistency. The sambar and chutney was spicy and was brilliantly flavorful, I kept on ordering the refills on this. Wife tried the South Indian thali, which was my least favorite. The choices of vegetables and curries were not the best and the taste wasn't awesome either. They did provide a nice looking fully covered dish, which looked delicious to the eye. 
The ambience is not so great, and is always busy as people visiting the SV temple quite often flock here for a quick snack or lunch. The service as I mentioned before wasn't the best. They took too much time to bring the food out initially. There were people waiting constantly at the door to be seated, which I m pretty sure didn't make their experience any pleasant. 
If you visit the SV temple close by, do visit this place, even if it's for a quick snack. PS- it's a crime to miss their Filter coffee and Mango lassi."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing! After spending 5 weeks in INdia recently, I have found that Udipi is the closest to \"real\" Indian food in Pittsburgh. Eating there brings back the sweet memories from my trip. The only difference between the food at Udipi and the Indian food that I ate travelling throughout India is the environment! I love it here and will be back often!"}
{"text":"Good food, a great deal.  The drive kept us from enjoying this as often as we should have.  Don't go with people who are watching their carbs - it's a lot of (delicious) bread and beans."}
{"text":"The guy at billing was quite rude. They closed serving with a reason of food is yet to come. That tells me the dont make food at this place and serve ready made food. 
Just a tip to them Dont be rude to atleast old ladies have some decency"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole in the wall.  The outside and inside are rather drab, but everyone there was Indian, so that seemed a good sign. I ordered takeout over the phone, which was a bit frustrating. There was a lot of background noise and it was hard to understand the guy on the other end. I ordered something I saw on their yelp menu, but I was told that wasn't on the menu and to order something else.  No matter what I asked, the only response was \"What do you want to order?\" Since they don't have a website, I just had to pick something common that most restaurants have: paneer tikka Masala and paneer dosas. I had to ask how long it would take to be ready; the guy said 30 minutes and hung up. Although I was told rice was included with the tikka masala, none made it into my to-go bag, which was disappointing, since it's really not a full meal without rice. The flavor was great though, with some wonderful spice. And the dosas were fantastic and came with delicious chutneys. The chai tea had a distinctive flavor I hadn't encountered before, which I'm guessing cones from the brand of tea - it was dark and almost bitter. I got a paper menu, so I can study it ahead of time and order more adventurous items next time I'm in town on business. Although the experience wasn't stellar, the food was really good and I basically want to try everything on the menu. 

I should mention this is a vegetarian restaurant, so if you're craving meat, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Authentic South Indian food, love the breakfast here . You get all the South Indian break fast here idly, Dosa , vada, poori, pongal. Every time I visit Pittsburg temple I would be here to eat . It is mostly busy on the weekends for lunch and dinner but on weekdays you can find the table easily . Don't look at the ambience it's all right , but the quality of the food is good and the service is fast . Try the dosas they are really good and try chole batura it tastes yummyyy... must visit place when you visit the Pittsburg temple !!"}
{"text":"Do not let the looks of the place fool you. Awesome authentic food. Its a hidden jewel."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic South Asian cuisine.  We had a party of six and ordered 10 items, 7 of which were delivered, staggered as they were ready, leaving the last two members of our party (including our 9 year old) without food at all. We had to talk to 3 different people before they completed the order. The ambiance is not great, but the food is, when it arrives."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. Very near to SV temple. We always visit this restaurant if we visit SV Temple. I found price is very cost effective. A must go place for every indian. South indian foods are special."}
{"text":"Really good food. Pretty bad service, especially if you aren't one of their regulars. I've been here a few times since the food is so good. If you are an \"outsider\" you will be served after all of the regulars are served. Again, the food is really, really good though, so it is worth the somewhat poor treatment."}
{"text":"I ordered curry, naan and masala, told the server I don't like any spice. What he brought me was too spicy. Maybe I am too particular with Indian food since I can't eat spicy. I endured and enjoyed the masala and naan but not th curry. Otherwise service was prompt and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"The most authentic Indian food I have had in Pittsburgh!! I will always go back to this place."}
{"text":"Ok.  So the place is a little off the beaten path, but we're local, so all good - a lunch adventure .  From the parking lot you start salivating - smells great!

We're seated and given water and our own pitcher to refresh - this I loved (loved) because I'm a water hound.  The place is way bigger inside than it looks.

Two of us ordered the Udipi Deluxe and an order of curry.

We both thoroughly enjoyed the meal, which was way too much food for lunch - but we didn't love everything, so worked out fine.  A couple of the items we absolutely loved.  Here's the reason for 4 stars and not 5:  No one on the staff spoke English and we couldn't communicate well enough to get the names of the items that we really liked a lot.

So here's the result:  We would both go back - it really was that good.  Would like to try dinner and judging from lunch, there really is nothing that would be a big risk.  Definitely flavorful well prepared food.  So, if you've never been and would like to satisfy your vegetarian epicuri-osity there is no reason to hesitate!"}
{"text":"I was enjoying the pleasant smell of this place when i initially walked in. The place was only half seated for a friday night. 80% of the people where indian so i figured this would be an authentic indian place. The seating and decorations were very old fashioned and I didn't much enjoy sitting with the cleaning equipment and used trays behind me. 

We ordered the appetizer platter to start which was  a very large portion for only two people to share. I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach. I didn't much like that everything was breaded and not like the thin crispy coating but it was very thick. All the batter was so thick that i could barely taste the vegetables underneath all the breading. One item was nothing but bread or maybe a potato of sorts. It tasted ok but it was just too thick.

For our entrees i ordered the dosa stuffed with potato and onions, my hubby ordered the masala made of cheese and a red sauce. I didn't like the masala because it tasted like foreign spaghetti sauce. The cheese flavor was a little too strong for me. I did however love the dosa. The bread was thin and soft like a crepe and very very large, Larger than the entire plate. I found that interesting that they made them so big. I wasn't sure how to eat it so i just tore off pieces of dosa and made small burrito like pieces with the potato and onions. They cam with alot of different sauces but they were very watered down. I had a white curry sauce, a green one and something that tasted like spicy tomato and vegetable soup. The soup mixture was probably my favorite. I ate it directly from the tin dish as if it were soup. They also had my favorite Tamarind sauce which was very yummy but a bit too thick. 

My only suggestion would be to update the decorations and dinnerware. I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of eating in a place that serves there food on cafeteria dishes. Other than that this place was not too bad. I will probably return to try a different dish and hopefully have a better result with my appetizer selection. Also, i didn't realize that this is a vegetarian spot so no lamb or chicken vindaloo :("}
{"text":"Udipi Cafe is popular among people who visiting the Indian temple in Pittsburgh. I have been here a few times and it always makes me feel as if I'm in an authentic South Indian restaurant in Bangalore. 
They are usually crowded on weekends so the service can be slow at times but the food makes up for the service. You cannot go wrong with anything you order here.
Our usually menu consists of a vegetarian sampler that has an idli, a medu vada, a vegetable cutlet, a samosa, a couple of onion rings and a couple of mirchi bajjis. I don't remember a time when we were here and we did not order the sampler. It comes with a whole bunch of chutneys and a bowl of sambar. 
Next comes the main course which usually comprises of choley bhatoore or fried rice or any paneer dish. The portions are pretty big so you might need to take some of the food home with you. 
The filter coffee is something you won't get everywhere in the US and is a must have. 
I know I'll come here many more times"}
{"text":"Worst customer service

 No one greeted us while entering... a guys visited our table and served water... waited for 20 mins just to get the menu.... then the guy from counter came to our table and asked in a rude voice if u guys re served... when we said no politely... instead of saying sorry at the first place... he shouted back saying u guys have to wait at the door to get seated... and started speaking in a commanding manor.... seriously... Man U are serving food not donating food...seriously you need to take lessons on customer service.... just because the other Indian restaurants re far away you cannot take customers for granted....  we thought of ordering the second round however he placed the check at the corner of the table and walked away without even turning back at us as if we were eating at his place for free... will never suggest these guys to anyone ever. Thanks for your hospitality"}
{"text":"Despite living in Curry Hill in Manhattan, I have to get my fix every time I am back in Pittsburgh.  Damn Udipi. You are too good.  Don't let the outside deceive you.  This place is for real.  Everything is super fresh and the spices will enthrall you.  This time we split poori, Palak Paneer, and the Baigan Ka Bharya - amazing.  Everytime though - everything I order always blows me away.  It is vegetarian only - but you don't miss it when the flavors are this good."}
{"text":"Very very poor service. They treat people very badly. When I said I have been waiting for 1.45 hours, the waiter responds there are people waiting for 2 hours very proudly. I would not recommend this place though their food was good. People should be treated better. Udipi Cafe it would be lot better if you can learn some hospitality."}
{"text":"This is place is quaint and delicious. We had the masala dosa and chickpea curry. The dosa was insane!!!! The spices on the stuffing was truly out of this world. I like this place because it was different than the usual indian cuisine I typically enjoy. It was nice having some \"finger foods\" that totally excite the palate. Also it seemed to be cheaper than the other indian places in the pittsburgh area. This place is a keeper!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, definitely reminds me of traveling in southern India.  As you may read, decor and location are unique, but the food is worth every bit of effort.  Service reminded me of what it was like to actually order in India...slightly confusing but courteous.  Can't wait to return.  The South Indian Thali was a hit at our table."}
{"text":"It's more like 2.5/5.

Food: The food is absolutely delicious! I give it 9/10 on food. Best dishes I've had here are Chana Batura, Idli Vada, Masala dosa, Dahi Vada. Most appetizers and main course items taste very well. I never had rice items, but my friends told me they didn't really enjoy them.

Service: Absolutely Terrible. They should really learn how to treat their customers with a bit of respect and not be rude to them. I give them 1/10.

Hygiene/Ambience: It's not a very hygienic place and the ambience is very noisy. I'd give a 4/10.

Price: Its a moderately priced place, for about $15-20 you can have a very satisfying meal. I give it 7/10 for price.

I have had some bad experiences here, but I really love the food. I really hope they can improve on the customer service and hygiene."}
{"text":"Authentic south Indian food in Pittsburgh?  You bet!  Come here for your dosa fix!"}
{"text":"We were driving through the area and I had a craving for Indian food, so I stopped by here and ordered several items to go: masala dosa, spring dosa, and palak paneer. I was impressed with how fast they got it all ready (10 minutes). The spring dosa sounded good on paper, but tasted quite bland in real life. The masala dosa was tasty. I must also add that the masala dosa was absolutely gigantic (exactly what I was hoping for). I had to cut it up into many pieces to eat. The palak paneer was on par with every other palak paneer I've had. I had Udipi Cafe bookmarked for a while now, but sadly I didn't find it to be that great.

{"text":"I happen to chance upon this place on my way to Pittsburg with my family and I am glad I made this stop! As soon as you enter, you get the feeling you have entered a south Indian restaurant located in India. 

We ordered various dishes compising of idli, vada and dosas. The sambhar and chutney were authentic and I think I ended up having 2 dosas: mysore sada and the pav bhaji dosa. You develop an appetite within minutes of being here and the service is quick as well. To add to this, the owner/one at the counter was happy to direct us to places in and around Pitt.

One of the best south Indian I've had in US and a mandatory stop for all who've never tried/want to try/simply enjoy a south Indian delicacy."}
{"text":"Excellent food...

Has to be the best South Indian food I have had in the US including a bunch of Udipi cafes.

Don't go by the looks of the place. It's very clean on the inside and the food just hits all the right spots....

Was glad I stepped in...."}
{"text":"Be surprised ... it's on a very lonely stretch of road. Worth the effort."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years for quality South Indian food. The best dish in my opinion is the chana batura. It is a large batura that is crispy, warm, and bigger than your face with a side of chana. The chana is nothing too special, but the batura makes it worth it. It is something that I cannot recreate at home. If I don't get that, I will get a dosa. Their dosas are very fresh and long. My friends had gotten the thali and enjoyed the variety of it. Don't expect great service, but come for the food."}
{"text":"While in the Monroeville area (near Pittsburgh), I decided to use Yelp to find the most popular local restaurant in the Monroeville area.  This search led me to the slightly out of the way Udipi Café.  I have never been to an all-vegetarian restaurant before and per the menu, this place serves \"pure South Indian vegetarian cuisine\".  While having enjoyed many an Indian dish, w/ meat mind you, I decided to listen to all the strong Yelp reviews and try this place.  

Atmosphere - Simple, Booths, Linoleum, Paneling, Clean, Mom & Pop feel.

Food - I ordered from the lunch menu and went with a curry.  I ordered the Aloo Gobi (potatoes & cauliflower cooked with Indian spices).  This came with a side of jasmine rice and chapathy (to me seemed like plain naan....see my photo and judge for yourself).  When the dish arrived, it was nicely presented with an accompaniment of yogurt that consisted of diced cucumbers, carrots, and celery.  I also received a little dish that contained Indian spices to include as desired.  These spices added some great flavor to the meal.  To wash all this deliciousness down, I ordered water and something I have had before, Lassi (a yogurt drink).  This Lassi however was mango flavored, which made it even tastier.  

Service - Helpful, cheerful, prompt, and patient with a novice. 

Price - $7.50 Combo, Mango Lassi $3.50 over all not too bad .

Overall - A great experience even if I would not mind adding some nice lamb to my Aloo Gobi...I am just saying..."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Pittsburgh. GIve it a try!!! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Indian music and images of Lord Krishna are the few items adding to the atmosphere,  but it's really about the cuisine.  The place is usually full of Indian families so it must be authentic. My husband's head sweat confirms the spices are of the highest quality."}
{"text":"What, I'm giving a vegetarian place 5 stars? Yep, really! I do love meat, but if you're feeling the veggie fare then please pleas please go here. This is by far the best indian food in Pittsburgh (veg/non-veg it doesn't matter). Been there a couple of times and tries a lot of stuff on the menu.

They don't do that spicy food, but oh the flavor. This is by far the best Indian place in the vicinity of Pittsburgh. I do love butter chicken and all that Indian chicken fare but really do give this place a try.

Great dosas, great bhaturas, the veggie curries are great. I can't make claims about the dessert because I haven't tried it but I really want to go back there soon. I will update if I try anything new."}
{"text":"After trudging along the back roads of Monroeville, not knowing if we were going the right direction, we arrived at what is Udipi Cafe, perched on a slight hill, and were greeted by a stunning man with a crop of thick hair in a long mushroom haircut and thick mustache. This was off to a great start.

We sat down at a basic brown table and with Udipi's sparse decorations and dim decor we felt like we were in a cafeteria. But nonetheless the place was hopping. As we had no clue what to order, I had look to Serena R for recommendations and we ordered everything she suggested, not knowing what we had gotten ourselves into:

Mango Lassi Milkshakes
Medhu Vada
Masala Dosai
Chana Batura

Everything was tasty and man a bit more spicy then I expected but delicious. The Medhu Vada (donut) was deceivingly very filling given its size. I do like the soup that accompanied though not sure how I feel about the coconut pudding. I think since there were two of us we could have just ordered the Masala Dosai or Chana Batura but I'm glad we ordered both for this tasting. We kept seeing orders of these two items coming out of the kitchen frequently. Thanks to Serena R I will be back to Udipi for some Southern Indian food again."}
{"text":"After hearing everyone go wild about this place... I wanted to like it... I really did. But, I've eaten here twice and both times I was thoroughly disappointed.    

I've had chana masala and a dosa here. The chana masala was watery and flavorless. The dosa was on the border of unpalatable, as it had a plethora of uncooked onion shards slathered throughout.

Based on the food alone, this place deserves one and a half stars. However, I'm giving it two stars, because the prices are reasonable and the portions are commendable. Plus it's all vegetarian, which is a thumbs up in my book. 

In sum, if you're interested in supporting an all vegetarian establishment, give this place a go. But, if you're just looking for a decent meal, pass this place up. There are better options in Pittsburgh proper, so save your gas for more worthy culinary adventures..."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Fast moving as we had a very little wait time. My 3 stars are primarily for the food.

However can do better with service. Just a little smile complementing the good food can take this place really far in terms of the customer experience.

Agree with the fact mentioned by some other reviewers that the known people get a special treatment and attention."}
{"text":"Great food with great flavor. I loved the chana masala and poori. My husband got the lunch special and everything was delicious. I will definitely go back. The service was a little slow but we weren't in a rush."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend who promised it would be amazing. She also warned that it is kind of in the middle of nowhere--and it was. I'll admit this probably isn't somewhere I would have ever stopped on my own based on its appearance and location. 

But the food! I had the chana masala and it was pretty much perfect. Just spicy enough and tons of flavor. The dish was served with rice and sauces. We also split several other appetizers and everything was great. Portions were generous and we took home leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

They lose a star for service (took foreeeeeever to get a check and boxes) but the food made up for that. I'm sure I'll be back here in the future--definitely a special treat."}
{"text":"For the non-Indians this is a South Indian delicacy place. So forget the chicken tikka masala and naan. This is the place to indulge in some dosa n vadas with sambhar and cocunut chutneys. The weekend specials with a soup (rasam yummm), medhu vada/idli, choice of dosa, and coffee/tea is the best value meal of the day.
All the dosas I tried here are good; especially the onion rava masala was crispilicious.

Note : For those who want an out-of-menu specialty go for the gobi manchurian. If you are lucky the chef might make a spicy appetizer for the entire table to nibble on."}
{"text":"If Udipi were in Seattle, it would be mobbed, with lines waiting for hours in the rain.

But it's in a particularly obscure area of Pittsburgh (who would thought there'd be a restaurant of any type on this stretch of road). And it was 3/4 empty on a Sunday evening at 6:30 pm.

The extensive menu is packed with Indian food like you've probably never experienced. Fortunately, there were three of us and we were able to try a variety of dishes. This is vegetarian food and it's spectacular - clean and distinct flavors and interesting condiments.

The service was plain. As someone else said, they take and deliver your order, and then leave you alone. We didn't notice the interior much (our eyes were in the menu), but it seemed pretty ordinary. 

We ate a lot of great food for $36, including tip. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant! Every time I go I get a table full! The service is really wonderful! The boss helps to cook, comes out from the back to speak with the customers, and helps his employees! I am vegetarian so I love that I can come here and eat anything!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Udipi while travelling back from Cincinatti. It's rather off the beaten path at the start of the boonies. NOT where you'd expect to find an Indian restaurant (nor the store next door).

First off, Udipi is purely vegetarian.  Which I can respect. There food was very good and they offered a number of dishes that are not common at most other Indian restaurants.

We ordered Nav Ratan Korma as it's a vegetarian dish that I always find to be very flavorful. We ordered a couple of appetizers, including fried cheese, bread balls of some sort - both of which came with a vegetable stew which was quite flavorful.

We also ordered several types of bread, Naan, chappati, and poori. (Poori is a puffed bread and my daughter absolutely loved it. She called it pasta bread. I didn't understand why my 4 yr old daughter called it that and when I asked she explained \"Cause it smells like pasta daddy. You're so silly.\" Sure enough, I smelled the bread and it did have a scent reminiscent of pasta.)

The biggest surprise was the Dosa. And I would say this is a MUST ORDER ITEM.  We ordered one of the dosas which came with a potato and onion filling inside a crispy crepe like bread.  We were expecting something akin to a burrito. What they brought out was HUGE.

Udipi gets 4 stars. I am a meat lover, so the lack of meat prevents this restaurant from scoring higher."}
{"text":"My venture into Indian food started out pretty rough.  Maybe it was because the first time I tried it was at a place that used to be a strip club in Erie.  I was sick for three days after. Obviously you can see why I'd stay away....

Fast forward years later and I had a taste of some pretty good Indian in SF and figured I'd venture back in with an Indian food expert.  So Serena R was kind enough to take me to her fav spot in the Burgh.  Monroeville is definitely not my ideal destination spot in Pgh, but for good food, I'll travel anywhere!

I had Serena suggest a couple things and settled on the Vada for an app.  These are tiny fried donut holes with chutney and sambar sauces.  This was a great first nibble!  I ordered the Butter Marsala Dosa because I love the potato mixture inside!  I thought that was delish, although being a supersize American I would have loved more taters, but i definitely enjoyed the portion I had!  

We also ordered the Channa Batura, which is a huge puff of rice dough with a chick pea mix.  I'm sorry I'm totally not being correct with my Indian food descriptions, but this was probably my favorite dish.  I really loved the doughy rice and the chick pea mix to dip it in.  The dough part is HUGE, and we didn't finish it all.  I took it home with the chick peas.  I know I probably won't eat much of the dough, but I'm definitely finishing the chick peas!

I would absolutely come back and try something else new.  The menu is huge, so you could take a while discovering your favorite dish!  And everyone is right, you don't mind it being vegetarian only, since everything tasted so great, you don't miss the meat!"}
{"text":"a great hole in the wall for some good indian food.  cheap, authentic and very good.  definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Super late restaurant!!! Made us wait for 1 hour to take the order and guess what!!!!!They took another 30 minutes to annoy us just enough and we left the restaurant. No one cared about our departure. No stars for this useless restaurant."}
{"text":"I think the food here is great but do prefer some meat in my Indian food! Atmosphere leaves a little to be desired and took quite a while for them to serve us"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times just for the quality of South Indian cuisine they serve. The food is true to its taste. However their service is subpar. My last visit to this place was horrible. The service has now made sure that imi don't go there and will recommend the same to anyone who is looking for good service. The owner needs to train their staff better.  Food is good but the service ruins it big time !"}
{"text":"Some damn good South Indian food. It's cheap therefore the service isn't going to be the best, but who cares, the food is soooo good, and you pay next to nothing for it!"}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews from several different sources we decided that we needed to check out. Udipi.  We randomly decided one night to check it out.  As we pulled up, the parking lot was packed!  Most of the tables inside were filled as well.  Obviously lots of people really enjoy this restaurant.  
  We sat down and ordered some drinks and took a look at the menu.  We did no preparation before we came here and I kind of wish we had.  The service and educational aspect left us kind of disappointed.  We have dined at Abay and Tana before and had great help from servers on what to order, since obviously we were not at all familiar with their cuisine.  I had hoped for the same here.  Maybe some of our issue was a language barrier, maybe a new server.  Not entirely sure, but as we asked for some assistance on the menu, he essentially pointed at a page and encouraged us to pick something from the list of 20 entrees.  
  I do think we actually did an ok job of ordering.  We started with the appetizer sampler which came with numerous different types of fried foods and dipping sauces.  Again, we had no idea what anything was.  Our plate arrived and we were stumped on what we were eating and which dipping sauces were for which food items.  They did taste good though.  
  I ordered the combination platter, which came with rice in the middle and a whole bunch of toppings rotating around the bowl.  It did taste very good, although I was not sure how to eat everything (Do we pour it overtop the rice, do we put the rice into each individual side, do we not need rice for some of them?)  My wife ordered the eggplant curry and enjoyed here dish very much.  We also ordered a bread that came out sizzling.  It had the consistency similar to a fried phyllo dough.  I went well with the the chutney.
Overall, the food we ate was very good and very unique.  I was disappointed with the service we received.  I'm sure if we were dining with someone who knew more about the food that the experience would have been much different."}
{"text":"Absolutely.  Authentic.  South Indian Food.  South indian food is a specialty that not many people have tried, but that's what they offer, and that's what you'll get.  Steaming hot puri, pillowy soft vada, and huge crispy dosas.  

No atmosphere, scowling service, but it's all worth it.  Everything is vegetarian, and everything is spicy.  I always get mysore masala dosa and I have never once regretted it.  

The samosa is good, but don't order the other token north indian dishes, like spinach and paneer.  That's like going to a phenomenal sushi place and ordering general tao's chicken.  You'll be disappointed.

I hesitate when I read reviews that the food could be better or taking stars off for not serving meat.. That's like saying that matzah ball soup could be better by adding a little lard, or that lingua tacos would be better if they used filet mignon.  

This place is catering to a crowd that wants to eat what grandma made at home.  And they always fulfill that expectation.  Soul food at it's finest."}
{"text":"I live in New England area and got a chance to visit Pittsburgh, after seeing many 5 star reviews on Yelp I went to this place. It was crowdy and waiting time is long, we ordered two thalis both doesnt taste well. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Last time I was here with my friends, we had an unpleasant experience. At first, the person taking our order rushed us to order food which was very rude. After that, when we asked for extra menu, they said they have other customers and need menus. Throughout our lunch, they had stack of unused menus at the front desk. I am hoping this review will serve as a feedback to the management so that other customers won't experience the same."}
