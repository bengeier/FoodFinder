{"text":"This is my favorite place to get tacos in Vegas. Thursday-Saturday from 10pm - 1am sometimes later. Best part they have vegan options!"}
{"text":"As good as tacos get!
Fresh, quick and very reasonably priced.  Can't go wrong here . . . the entire menu is sensational!!!"}
{"text":"This food truck is quite a treat!

It's usually parked outside Sand Dollar (corner of Spring Mountain and Polaris) from 10 PM - 2 AM. Nice that it's right outside the bar since Sand Dollar doesn't serve any food. I tried Tacos Zopapan tonight as we were starving. The service was super friendly and prompt! We split 3 carne asada tacos, a chicken quesadilla, and a ginormous steak burrito for $20. The gent who took our order was polite and everything came out in less than 10 minutes. We went back inside the bar to enjoy a drink while waiting for our meal to be freshly grilled.

There's a large variety of tacos to choose from for $2 each. Quesadillas are $6 and burritos are $7. Tacos for $2 are a little pricey IMO but the $7 burrito was huge and worth every penny. The $6 quesadilla was decent in size and absolutely delicious... The avocado made it complete. We agreed next time we'll just order 3 of those.

Great food truck with tasty Mexican bites. I've seen it outside Sand Dollar several times and am glad I finally tried it tonight!!"}
{"text":"Unreal, and that's not the alcohol talking.  This truck would rate up there compared to anything in L.A. and even in parts of Mexico for that matter.  The seasoning of everything is so goddamn on point and it's been delicious every time I stumble out of the Sand Dollar. But I swear it's not the alcohol talking."}
