{"text":"I love this restaurant. It's wonderful on so many levels. The location is a beautiful drive that takes you through some lush green fields if you're driving from mason. It's a family owned restaurant where the recipes are mom and pop perfected over years of being in the business. So needless to say, crazy high nom factor. And the gentleman running the place is super friendly so you get to hear some nice stories and experiences from his life in the south and the Midwest...the lunch buffet and dinner both are a win. Fresh and authentic from scratch. Unbeatable taste!"}
{"text":"Oh man. Don't miss out on this place.  I went for lunch they have a very small lunch type Buffett with several choices and separate menu with entree selection.  The folks are friendly and know how to take care of you.  The food is prepared fresh and they care about the ingedients, as you can see and taste this in the each different entree.  The food is described as Pakistani Mediterranean and  Indian in style and menu and they also serve many vegetarian items.  This is one of the best I've ever eaten.   The tastes are unique.   Help support this great place to eat.  Get your butts out here."}
{"text":"The food was seasoned beautifully, with fresh ingredients and not overcooked/mushy sauces.  The proprietor was kind and helpful.  Sadly, we were the only ones there on a Monday evening at peak dinner hours and no restaurant has survived in that location long.  I hope they buck that trend."}
{"text":"We (4 of us) went for the lunch buffet. Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tandoori, Mutton Gravy are very nice.  I would say it's one of the best compared to other places for non veg buffet.   Friendly owner and a very good service.   The price is little expensive ( 10.99) for a weekday lunch buffet but worth the quality and taste of the food."}
{"text":"Super authentic out-of-the-way tour of Pakistani/Indian food! If you're yelping while stuck in Friday rush hour traffic in a city you know a little about, but not much, and wanting to try extraordinary food,  then this is a quite a find! It's a bit of a journey off the main drag,  but simple to find.  We started with the Aloo kebob and chicken pakora...I was a bit disappointed in the very mild flavor, hoping the rest of dinner would not follow suit. The tamarind sauce was the winner of apps, but if you chat with the owner, he'll let you try the coriander/mint sauce...yeah, I want to be on the sauce if the month club with direct shipment. A hint of heat with a gentle balance of mint and coriander...WOW! He said they served it with the kebob meats, but why stop there? I was dipping my naan in at the end, just cause I could!  Then entrees...My husband had the chicken makhany, fabulous! Think of a creamier version of tikka masala with a suprise of heat on the backside. Serve it with this unusual bismati rice from Pakistan that reminded me of a sticky Jasmine rice yet retained the destinctive bismati smell and you got a perfect meal! And the portion! Enough for dinner and midnight snack at $11...definiately a steal.  I chose the yelp fans favorite, biryani...everyone was absolutely spot on with their reviews! And the raita...reminded me more of tzatziki with the cucumber. Really, really good!   So if you're looking for some pretty authentic, not out of a jar, Indian food for less than $30 for two, including two apps and dessert on a Friday night, then venture over to Munghals Grill. It definitely will not disappoint...  WARNING: Be prepared to take your time...especially if you start asking the owner questions.  We wanted to learn more, so we asked more, but our off the beaten road adventure lasted over two hours!"}
{"text":"New dishes added to the lunch buffet including kofta malai, best veggie dish ever tasted in indian restaurant"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, one of the few places that still utilize the tandoori. Completely enjoyed my meal. Also, I spoke with the owner, he is a very humble and generous man. Will be back."}
{"text":"I was in Cincinnati on a business trip from Geneva and so much wanted a great place. This place has amazing food and even better attitude of the owner. I went there on a friend's serious recommendation and thanked him later for taking me there. We had chicken karahi , lamb and beef kababs. Needless to say that nothing was left on the table. Owner made special effort for us to ensure that we feel at home, even when it was getting late. I am definitely going back there again everytime i am in Cincinnati. I was so happy to find  brilliant food away from home. Thank you Abbas (owner), you have a great place."}
{"text":"A wonderful surprise in Mason.  Authentic Indian and Pakistani cuisine in a simple but charming setting.  The goat curry was rich and delicious, and the tandoori chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy.   Coupled with extremely kind and accommodating service, and Mughal Grill is at the top of my list of Indian restaurants in Cincinnati."}
{"text":"With such high ratings, one would expect a bustling restaurant.  Went in on a Wednesday night on a business trip, and I was the only one in the restaurant.  The goal of this restaurant is to provide authentic dishes, but the menu is not well laid out and does not explain how the dishes will be served. The Chicken Curry was quite good and apparently authentic, but with growing up in the U.S., I was not expecting all the bones and cut bones in the curry.  The very nice owner also offered me Palek Paneer, a spinach dish, which was very tasty.  The garlic naan may have been authentic, but it was rather plain compared to other naans I've tasted.  Once you get to know what this owner is serving, I'm sure one would appreciate his menu and his emphasis on authenticity, but he needs to do a better job of explaining his menu and warning his customers of the non-Americanized dishes on the menu.  Without talking to the owner after the dishes were served, I doubt I would ever plan on coming back.   Oh, and no wine or beer is served.  I believe the food has the potential of four to five stars, but the lack of ambiance (a little light music would be a start) and the lack of explanation of the menu is forcing me to give this restaurant only two stars.    I do wish him the best."}
{"text":"Went here again last night with visiting colleagues... It's fast becoming our go-to place for dinners for visiting friends  Again the food was simply outstanding and the best Pak/Ind food in the region. I won't comment on ambience as that's subjective but while this is likely not a \"date night\" place, if all you want is to eat great food with friends, you should consider this   Special thanks to the owners for accommodating us last night as we got there pretty late"}
{"text":"Excellent home cooked food. And the biryani to die for. If it was closer to my house i would go daily."}
{"text":"I am not a big review on yelp (yet!) but I had to review this place. This is some of the best and most authentic home cooked food you will find in OH (perhaps in the US even!) if you go, get their beef kebabs and their biryani, it's absolutely delicious! the owner rightly describes his kebabs as 'if you don't like these kebabs then you don't like kebabs!' He was right!  Their naans are made from scratch, their vegetarian dishes are to die for (this coming from me a complete non veg person!). The vegetarians at our table made sure to pack some food, one of them was traveling from New York and guess what, he took the food bag to the big apple!   The food takes a little while to prepare during lunch especially if there is a big order, we usually order ahead and then go in and everything is ready.   If you happen to be in and around the West Chester area, you cannot miss this place!"}
{"text":"We had a very nice dinner.. When we went here we were the only people inside and so thought we had selected a wrong place for dinner.. But we were very impressed on receiving each and every order.. Kabab, Goat Biriyani,sooji halwa, palak panner, rice kheer, mango lassi, naan and chicken curry were excellent..  Owner was a very hospitable person too..   Information: spice level was mild.. So if South Indians prefer to go must insist for more spice on the food.."}
{"text":"Our office group (a large portion of the people being Inidan) has been to all the area Indian restaurants. This one is by far our favorite. The place is run by by an older couple on their own, I don't think they have any wait staff, maybe one young lady we've seen in there occasionally. They're pretty much doing everything on their own. We make sure to call ahead anytime we're going, they take special orders and for courtesy to let them know how many of us will be there. That way, there's plenty of food on the buffet ready for us to eat when we arrive. They always have bottles of water waiting, it's mostly self-service. At the end of our meal, we just go up to the counter and pay for our meals, not wait for the check to arrive.   The food is absolutely amazing, a little spicier than you'll find in some of the other Indian buffets in the area. I highly recommend giving Mughal Grill a try!!!   * Don't be put off by the fact that it might be empty when you get there.  ** Make sure you call ahead, it's worth it!!  *** Some of my favorites: Chana Masala, Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tikka, Palak Paneer, Bhindi Masala (Okra)... Dessert, Kheer and Carrot Halwa"}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. The food I had (what was available ) was very flavorful but for a buffet  there were not to many options. It seemed  very authentic  but there was a lack of variety. The atmosphere  was worth zero stars. Dark quite and depressing  we were literally  the only ones there. It has a lot of potential  but the area isn't the best so it's probably  hard to justify going all out for minimal business.   There was no dessert offered for the buffet but they made something  up real quick which was nice. However  to me a dessert should be a given on an idian buffet. We ordered  waters and all they had were small bottled  waters kept at room temp.   Not to mention  the price was high, most idian  lunch buffets in the area are 8.99 and this was 11.99. I have no issue  paying 11.99 but for room temp water maybe 5 options and no dessert?    I did speak with the owner who was very nice and truly cares about was he serves. It is clear he is disappointed with the lack of business  but with all things considered  I can see why other buffets are crowded  and this one is suffering. He spoke off all these great dishes but there was nothing to sample.   Like I said there is a lot of potential  but unless there are drastic changes I will not be back anytime soon. After  reading all of the great reviews maybe we went on an off day but for a place like this first impression  are everything ...."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say a few words about the owner. Abbas is a great man. He truly cares about his customers!   I have visited this place several times. The food was great every time. I also take my colleagues to lunch very often. They all love this place too.   Freshly made food makes such a difference. The dessert, rice kheer is so yummy!"}
{"text":"The passion to make good food shows in the taste. Awesome food try it if you are in this area. It's more like a lavish home cooked meal than a typical restaurant fare. Will look for off the menu dishes next time."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner with great spread and authentic taste...esply the service from the owner. We reached late even then he was very courteous and brought in whatever we ordered for. Totally a great time we all had...."}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Very friendly owner who seems very passionate about food.  Everything we tried was good. The owner also had us try couple of dishes that he was experimenting, they were delicious!  The ambience of the place is average, in line with the prices. I have been there a few times and will go again"}
{"text":"Some very good Indian/Mediterranean food. Went on a Saturday and ate the buffet. I normally don't like buffets but will have to admit everything was very good and the owner kept bringing out fresh warm naan and this sweet orange colored wheat that was just yummy. Not to mention the rice pudding was extremely good, if not the best I have had.   I plan to go back and eat off of the menu."}
{"text":"Only if I could give it ZERO stars. If you are planning to eat a buffet here, turn back and go to Kadai about a mile from here. The buffet is terrible. They serve only 1 or 2 main dishes, 1 appetizer, no deserts and no vegetarian  options. If you charge more than $10 for a weekend buffet, I expect you to have at least 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 2 desert options with decent vegetarian and non vegetarian options. Stop calling yourself GRILL. My wife is a vegetarian and we found our way out as soon as we saw the arrangement. The interior looks like its 200 years old and not very welcoming."}
{"text":"I had the Keema samosa and the Karahi chicken which was Amazing! Very flavorful dish. The service was great. The owner and the chef checked up on me and made sure to ask me how I was enjoying my food. I live in Fairfield but for the food and the service I don't mind making the drive. Next time I'm come back I'll definitely try their buffet!"}
{"text":"Amazing one of the best lamb chops and Kadhai Chicken I have had in a long time"}
{"text":"After seeing the five star reviews here, we decided to try Mughal Grill. I can echo what other reviewers have said: the food is brilliant; the service is less than.  The place is in a mostly-deserted strip mall. We arrived at 6pm and were promptly greeted by the owner. We were the first customers; he turned on the lights and the heater (which were off) for us. We followed his suggestions for appetizers and entrees, and we were the only customers in the place for the next thirty minutes.  Our appetizer arrived about twenty minutes later; the entrees after another forty minutes. Again: The food was wonderful. But by 7pm the restaurant was filling up. And after our entrees were delivered, the owner (who was apparently the only person waiting tables) never returned to our table--no refills, no \"how's everything?\", nothing. Two hours after we'd arrived, we walked to the front and asked for a check. It seemed like they didn't have the personnel to deal with the dinner rush; some people who'd arrived after us didn't even have water yet.  When we received our food, we thought \"we must take our friends here!,\" but then, after an hour of no service, we decided otherwise. I think this place is well worth a visit (maybe the lunch buffet is better in terms of service), but I wouldn't schedule a dinner if you're worried about leaving promptly."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because I love Indian food. It is indeed in a rundown shopping center but not in the center proper, instead it's in a small house at the edge. The garlic Nan is awesome ... good thing an earlier reviewer mentioned this because it is not on the menu. The curry chicken was good, and the Basmati rice was great. As an earlier reviewer said, the chicken has bones in it, but hey, so do chicken wings, and fish, so what do you expect \"chicken mcnuggets?\" Anyway, I was the first one there, and they did in fact turn on the lights. After a while they turned on some music after other people arrived -- it was sort of an Indian Bosa Nova kind of music. The server / owner was very attentive, and friendly. The only thing is the Mango Lasse, was rather warm, and not cold like I normally like it. All in all it was a good dinner."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum.  Palak paneer is epic.  Worth the drive, even from the other side of town.  Chicken is outstanding and juicy.  Call ahead for catering and shamelessly stuff your face at home or share with you family.   Servings are generous but I could go through 4-5 plates.  Just roll me and my stuffed belly home.  What a gem."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and was in need of an Indian food fix. The reviews were awesome so why not, right? I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner for a little bit before picking up our food. He made a couple of recommendations for our next order and even gave me two different rice puddings to try (which was amazing!). The vegetable samosa, Chicken Makhny and Saag were really good. Next time we are going to go a little hotter in spice (9 out of 10)."}
{"text":"Got take out here with my girlfriend hoping this restaurant would live up to its 5 star rating.  The man who took my order on the phone was very polite and courteous.  When I went to pick up my food, I'm guessing I encountered the same person, he was very polite and friendly as well.  I was surprised that the curry chicken I ordered didn't come with rice.  When I asked about it, the man gave us an order of rice for no charge.  I left optimistic, The service so far had be very personable.  When I got home and started eating, it became evident very quickly that the chicken used to make our food was chock full of bones.  I mean like every single bite had bone in it.  I had to chew very carefully to make sure I didn't stab a bone into the roof of my mouth, or swallow one.  The curry sauce was delicious, but I found it very hard to enjoy this meal with bony chicken meat.  I may give this place another shot because I liked everything else, but those bones will be a deal breaker if I encounter them again."}
{"text":"If you love Indian food than you must go here.  We enjoy going to Indian food lunch buffet's - enjoy the variety.  This way we don't have to pick just one item.  Anyway, went there for lunch today.   Selection was good and the food was outstanding.  The spices in the food was unbelievable.  Only disappointment/ surprise is that we were the only ones there.  Hopefully the word will get out and they will get more people.  Owner was very nice and explained the items."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch with a friend who has never had indian food. It was absolutely AMAZING. chicken curry was to die for and the rice pudding dessert was great. I assume I was talking to the owner but he explained the food and was very helpful. I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, very authentic. Owner was very nice. I would definitely come back and encourage others to do so.  The rice pudding is amazing. Must try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the hand picked restaurants as its a family owned restaurants and best ones I have eaten so far as they cook only limited food so we can expect its always fresh so when we planned to go in group I do make sure I inform Abbas the owner ahead so he can expect us in buffet to prepare additional fresh foods. Regarding the quality for the food its exceptional especially the desserts are incredible no doubt its prepared with good care and cooked at right state to get the state we wouldn't get that taste anywhere around I bet :-) .  So sure I will recommend the restaurants if you like Chana masala or Puri or all desserts Suji Halwa, Carrot Halwa and Gir (Rappdi) no words. The owner is good at heart as well as he takes special care if you need any thing you can call ahead and request him ahead a day as well if you want that in your buffet :-). Overall I recomment it no doubt I miss the restaurant as now i moved to Chicago its even now mouth watering if I think about the taste of food. Sure check it out and write your comments don't hesitate to ask for additional desserts if you want to taste if hey have inside :-) So I will surely recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is really great. The staff are very nice and the food is delicious. Definitely one to check out, especially as the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The food was great, the environment is what threw me.  We came here on a Monday night around 7 or 8 pm.  Upon arriving, there were no virtually no cars in the lot.  We entered the restaurant and were a bit confused.  There were no patrons, no music, empty and partially stored serving dishes, and it seemed like a closed business.    The owner (I'm assuming) came around the corner and we asked if they were open.  He said yes and sat the 3 of us.  The place was so quiet it was uncomfortable.  On top of that, by observation, there were only 2 people working:  The owner and his wife cooking.  After a moment, we ordered.  The menu was fairly limited which was a bit surprising.  We got our food in a reasonable time and one more patron had entered the restaurant.  Throughout the meal we had enjoyable food and the service was reasonable with the exception that we got water 1 time when we initially sat and never again.  By the time we left, one more family had entered the restaurant.  I'm assuming by the other reviews that this is a one off experience.  If I had words of advice for the establishment it would be: ambient music, warmer atmosphere and pay attention to the water (luckily no one ordered food that was too spicy)."}
{"text":"Went a couple of days ago and service was horrible.  Very slow, want even given enough rice for everyone.  Took asking several times to get a single refill on water.  Curry was very oily and they do not offer varying spice levels like most Indian restaurants.  Finally had to get up and go to the front of the restaurant to try and ask for a check because it took so long.  Upon getting up, discovered a roach on our table under a plate.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"I have visited the restaurant a couple of times now and thanks to all the good reviews I read on yelp. It is one of the best if not the best to have Indian/Pakistani dishes. The spices are perfect and the goat biryani is awesome. The owner is very soft spoken as well. I suggest to try Goat Biryani or Naan (Indian bread) with chicken or goat curry. Actually I think I will be having my dinner tonight at Mughal grill. Thanks Mughal Grill for the tasty food. C you at 8 tonight!"}
{"text":"This was just weird......first off I couldn't find the place (run down strip mall and it's not even in the mall part). It looks like a struggling business, The owner was very nice. I gave the food away to a lady in the parking lot who told me she wrecked her car and asked for a ride to Walmart to get her insulin and I told her I couldn't but here's a free dinner.......she said GOD BLESS YOU.....it was then I realized I gave her the food because I didn't feel comfortable eating it and it was selfish of me to not be politically correct.....get over it....Trumps Pres . Off to city BBQ. (I didn't feel safe eating because I saw raw chicken sitting out, he was probably just prepping but I didn't want to take any chances....he also has a 504 area code.....again, just weird)"}
{"text":"Had the Sunday buffet. Everything was fresh and perfectly spiced. Had the Normal highlights for Indian buffet- chicken tikka masala, saag, chicken korma and some items I had never had before. Brought us out fresh hot naan. Great service and owner was kind and helpful. Plenty of parking and a nice clean restroom. Ate more than I should have because everything was so delicious."}
{"text":"Authentic and good quality food. Not a fancy place but a very good meal."}
{"text":"This place has been a new discovery for me, as it is close to the Indian grocery store. I went there a few weeks ago with friends for a sunday lunch buffer. It is a small restaurant, and the buffet is limited to just 6-7 dishes. What stands out about this buffet is that inspite of the limited food offerings, everything was very delicious and reminded me of a home-cooked Indian meal that we were accustomed to having in India. Another thing I loved about this place was that they served warm naan and pooris (puffed fried bread) in baskets straight to our table. The owners were very nice and the prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this place... try it for yourselves on a weekend for lunch"}
{"text":"Went to Mughal Grill for the first time last night even though it is extremely close to our house.   Not sure why it took us so long.  It may have been our first time but will not be our last.  Everything was delicious.  The nan was the best I have ever had. It was perfectly cooked, light and buttery.  We had Biryani which was fantastic and a huge portion. We also had Makhani which was well seasoned and creamy.  Everything was amazing.   For dessert we had rice pudding, This is my husbands favorite and was by far the best he had ever had.   Dessert was served with black tea English style (with cream).  It was the best Indian food I have had.   And we are fans of many Indian restaurants including Ambar in Clifton.   Mughal Grill beats them all!!  And the people are so very nice.  Please go and keep this wonderful restaurant going!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful experience here! We had a delicious, authentic meal this evening and enjoyed delightful conversation with the owner.  They were so kind, gave great, prompt service, and happily welcomed in my 1 year old grandchild. We loved the Palak Paneer, and the Tandoori Chicken. Locals should try them out - if anyone deserves to stay in business, these guys should!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and fresh. Everything is made to order and reasonably priced...I would say under-priced. The owners are super friendly and the customer service is excellent! The naans and kabobs are made in the restaurant in the tandoor oven. It's hard to find a place like this. Tastes just like mom's cooking!! And the brunch is amazing!! I highly recommend this restaurant. Great atmosphere and good food at a great price...what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend (who grew up in Northern India and moved to the states when he was 21) and I visited as a late Valentine's Day date. The restaurant has no sign, which made it difficult to find from the road. It looks like it is in an abandoned mall. I have driven past this place multiple times and never noticed it before. We were the only people in the restaurant at 7 pm on a Sunday.   The owner greeted us and let us choose where we wanted to sit. The restaurant was a little cold, but incredibly clean. Weirdly enough their bathroom smelled amazing.   We ordered the Shami Kabobs (which only I ate as BF is a vegetarian) and had the Chana Masala and Bhindi as entrees. We started with one naan to split, and ended up ordering two more.   The food is THE BEST in the Cincinnati area, and if you love authentic Indian food that is cooked to request this is the place for you.   I will be a regular here from now on."}
{"text":"Mughal Grill is by far the best restaurant for Indian and Mughal cuisine I had in this country. I ordered the lamb kababs and suji halwa. It will be unfair on my taste buds if I don't say they were the best I ever had in USA. I was offered a kheer on the house after the meal. It was a colorful gastronomic journey. The kheer was so perfect in taste with just the right sweetness and viscosity. I left the restaurant a happy man with rush of serotonin and endorphins in my brain.  I give this place a 5 out of 5 rating."}
{"text":"Love this place for awesome India like tandoori chicken and the yummy naan. I mean nowhere literally nowhere in cinci did I taste the authentic naan. Me n my hubby are definitely coming back for more Tikkas, kababs, dal makhni and garlic naan. Ugh how we missed it so badly.. Don't miss the weekend lunch buffets that we are told is a real treat!!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've ever had. I'm not being generous with my language, either. We were fortunate enough to have been served by the owner (we asked if he was the owner and he said \"you could call me that\") and he was fantastic. Very attentive, quality checks left and right, supportive and recommended different dishes, and still had time to stop and chat. Granted, we were the only ones in the restaurant at 7:30pm on a Thursday. I don't know why there aren't more people in this place, but I know I'll keep coming back and ordering the daal (lentil).  Also, order garlic naan. Do it. Don't even think about it. Just do it. It's like, $3 and it's the biggest piece of naan I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Nice food..they serve fresh food..but their service is very poor..the old man does everything himself i guess..he is the owner i think..the problem is you order something, and he will take forever to get your ordered dish..he also forgot some order and tell some story..for me everything can be ignored of food quality is good...so 4* and recommend others (keep enough time in hand) :)"}
{"text":"Mughal Grill is a gem. It is a family-owned and family-run business serving up authentic food that fills patrons through flavor rather than sheer quantity.  My wife and I came here because she had cravings for Indian food. When we arrived, the seedy-looking parking lot and a couple of liquor stores slightly deterred us. Out in the parking lot, however, a Pakistani family was loading up their kids back on their minivan--an encouraging sign.  Once we walked in, the restaurant was completely empty. We were again somewhat discouraged. Then, the owner walked out of the kitchen to warmly greet us. Mr. Nasir invited us to sit anywhere we would like and proceeded to open the top of his buffet stand personally, because the lids may be hot and he didn't want us to risk burning our fingers. He proceeded to explain a little about each dish as we loaded our plate with a sampler of all the curries and tandooris.  My personal favorite out of the bunch was actually their rice. Every bite was an explosion of spices and flavor rather than salt and heat. So many Indian restaurants assault taste buds with salt bombs and overwhelming amount of heat that I was actually initially confused. I would like to say that the food was \"salty\" yet I didn't crave water. I would like to say that the food was \"hot\" but it didn't burn my tongue (note: I am no wimp--I eat 7 stars out of 5 at Thai restaurants). I actually managed to discern the fine blend of spices used to flavor the rice and even the subtle meat flavors imparted by a couple of small pieces of chopped up chicken drumstick segments.  On to dessert, which was a homemade kheer (rice pudding). This is far better than any kheer I have ever had at any Indian restaurant in any city. This is real homemade stuff and not of the insta-mix store-bought variety. Mr. Nasir explained to us that these are freshly-made daily, and it takes them 3 to 4 hours to make each batch. They were so good that we ordered two containers of them to take with us.  All in all, Mughal Grill is a hidden gem in West Chester and our go-to place for fine Indian/Pakistani cuisine."}
{"text":"Excellent! Enjoyed thoroughly the freshly made sag paneer and tandoori chicken. The gentleman who owns the restaurant was gracious and his service was great."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I have been to! Buffet is super awesome, many great dishes. If you're in the area, you need to check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Well I don't have much experience in Indian food but we really like this place. The spices on the food were so tasty. I had the chicken with the special sauces of the restaurant and it tasted great. The flavored were unusual and spectacular. We had Naan bread that came to the table hot and super fresh. The owner came out and checked on our food. He was very friendly and helpful, answering our questions and explaining the menu. The dining room wasn't very crowded at all. Not sure why!  Our whole family is sure we will go back to this restaurant again soon."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is Mr Abbas , who makes sure you get more than full worth of your money and gastronomical tastes! From the samosas, to the goat Briyani to karhai chicken (made in authentic Kashmiri style) everything made us very happy and full. DO NOT miss the Kheer!  Definitely recommended and must visit place.  Will go there when ever we get a chance !!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I've never actually eaten here. HOWEVER, I know the owners, have eaten their homemade food before, and can only imagine the food is the same if not better at the restaurant.   First off, the owners are easily the nicest people I've met. They remind me of my own parents, friendly, warm, inviting, and all around good people. When you meet them, you instantly feel like you're around family, and that isn't something you can say about everyone.   Moving onto the meal experiences I've had with them...the naan is to die for. It literally melts in your mouth into delicious goodness. On top of that, I've always had perfectly cooked rice to accompany my curry. Overall, I can only imagine the restaurant to be at the same level of quality, and I hope to make it back there some day to check it out first hand!"}
{"text":"The food is flavorful and tastes freshly-made, something you cannot say for most other places for this price. They seem to take care in preparation and giving you what you want. I got my food to go, and you can see the attention to detail even in the packing. The place could use some livening up, but will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We'd give it 10 stars if we could.  And we are seasoned travelers who have eaten Indian food in every major city in the US.  Have never been to India, but I have to think it would be like this.  The curries, veggies and naan are to die for and don't forget the daal.  Perfectly spiced with amazing flavor.  The super nice owner grows all of his herbs fresh and it shows.  His wife does the cooking and she knows what she's doing.  Good sized portions, so go family style and share.  Great, great food!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  Really, amazing!  Everything was flavorful, tender and delicious.  The atmosphere is reserved and comfortable, definitely not loud or boisterous. If you want to get some authentic, homemade middle Easter and Indian food then this is the place.  They use organic ingredients, grass fed meats and imported spices.  Definitely an incredible combination of flavors and foods!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What other restaurants miss is the importance of hiring qualified cooks and chefs. Mughal has them. They're even requested by other restaurants to cook! Amazingly soft choley, perfect saag... Try once, return forever."}
{"text":"Amazing food. amazing people. We did the buffet and it was fun to try many different dishes. They told us that they also have a projector for sports games. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Wow. Mughal Grill was sadly a big disappointment. Seeing all the 5 star reviews, I was expecting this place to blow my mind.   We went for the lunch buffet and it failed in every category except for quality of food. The place was literally empty. There were only a handful of dishes. Chicken tandoori, chicken korma, chicken rice, paneer and aloo. For $11.74, I expected them to have at least 3 chicken dishes, a lamb, few veggie options and some desserts. We had to ask for dessert and they only made enough for 1 serving.   Sadly, I will not be returning because it is not worth the drive."}
