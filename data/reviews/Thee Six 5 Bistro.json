{"text":"4 of us each had something different (walleye, chicken Marsala, kielbasa & pierogies, and scallops with some sides).  It was all delicious.  Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but the atmosphere was awful. The employees were ready to mutiny over not getting paid. There were contractors that performed work on the property during construction demanding money. Even the mediocre food couldn't make up for the almost scary atmosphere. Good luck."}
{"text":"The place is closed didn't pay their suppliers and also screwed the employees. Bad people if they ever reopen I don't recommend patronizing. Would give negative stars if possible! !"}
